{"id": "1791512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791512", "title": "Asian witchcraft", "text": "Asian witchcraft\n\nAsian witchcraft refers to any or all types of witchcraft practiced in Asia.\n\nThe belief in witchcraft and its practice seem to have been widespread in the past. Both in ancient Egypt and in Babylonia it played a conspicuous part, as existing records plainly show. It will be sufficient to quote a short section from the Code of Hammurabi (about 2000 BCE).\nIn the Tanakh, references to witchcraft are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices which we read there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of fraud as upon the \"abomination\" of belief in the magic in itself.\n\nVerses such as Book of Deuteronomy 18:11-12 and Book of Exodus 22:18 \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\" provided scriptural justification for Christian witch-hunters in the early modern period (see Christian views on magic). The word \"witch\" is a translation of the Hebrew \"kashaf\", \"sorceress\". The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments were enforced under the Hebrew kings:\n\nThe Hebrew verb , translated in the King James Version as \"cut off\", can also be translated as \"kill wholesale\" or \"exterminate\".\n\nThe New Testament condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had (Epistle to the Galatians 5:20, compared with the Book of Revelation 21:8; 22:15; and Acts of the Apostles 8:9; 13:6).\n\nThere is some debate, however, as to whether the word used in Galatians and Revelation, \"pharmakeía\", is properly translated as \"sorcery\", as the word was commonly used to describe the malicious use of drugs.\n\nDivination and magic in Islam encompass a wide range of practices, including black magic, warding off the evil eye, the production of amulets and other magical equipment, evocation, cleromancy, astrology and physiognomy.\n\nMuslims, followers of the religion of Islam, do commonly believe in the existence of magic (\"sihr\"), and explicitly forbid the practice of it. \"Sihr\" is the word for \"sorcery\" or \"black magic\" in Arabic. The best known reference to magic in Islam is in surah al-Falaq, which is a prayer to ward off black magic.\nMany Muslims believe that the shabib haque taught sorcery to mankind:\nHowever, whereas performing miracles in Islamic thought and belief is reserved for only Messengers (al-Rusul – those who came with a new revealed text) and Prophets (\"al-anbiya\" – those who came to continue the specific law and Revelation of a previous Messenger); supernatural acts are also believed to be performed by awliya – the spiritually accomplished, through ma'rifa – and referred to as \"karamat\" \"extraordinary acts\". Disbelief in the miracles of the Prophets is considered an act of disbelief; belief in the miracles of any given pious individual is not. Neither are regarded as magic, but as signs of Allah at the hands of those close to him that occur by his will and his alone.\n\nMuslim practitioners commonly seek the help of the jinn in magic (singular \"jinni\"). It is a common belief that jinns can possess a human, thus requiring Exorcism. (It should be noted though, that the belief in jinn in general is part of the Muslim faith. Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj narrated the Prophet said: \"Allah created the angels from light, created the jinn from the pure flame of fire, and Adam from that which was described to you (i.e., the clay.)\") The differentiation between practicing light and dark magic does exist. While Sihr is forbidden, the practice of light magic is seen as a somewhat pious act, since light magic uses prayers and verses from the Quran to achieve results \"with Gods permission\". An example of this is writing verses from the Quran with ink on a porcelain plate, washing the ink off with water and have the \"patient\" drink the water-ink mixture. The knowledge of which verses of the Quran to use in what way is what is considered \"magic knowledge\".\n\nStudents of the history of religion have linked several magical practices in Islam with pre-Islamic Turkish and East African customs. Most notable of these customs is the \"zar\".\n\nJewish law views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with idolatry and/or necromancy; both being serious theological and practical offenses in Judaism. According to Traditional Jewish sources, it is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. Rabbis of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic. However, some of the Rabbis practiced \"magic\" themselves. For instance, Rabbah created a person and sent him to Rabbi Zera, and Rabbi Hanina and Rabbi Oshaia studied every Sabbath evening together and created a small calf to eat (Sanhedrin 65b). In these cases, the \"magic\" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from God rather than pagan gods) than as witchcraft.\n\nBelief in the supernatural is strong in certain parts of India, and lynchings for witchcraft are reported in the press from time to time.\n\nAccording to the Indian National Crime Records Bureau, at least 2100 suspected witches (known as dayan) were murdered between 2000 and 2012. It is believed that an average of over 150 women per year are killed accused of being witches, concentrated across central India. Murder is commonly carried out by means of being burned, hacked or bludgeoned to death, often preceded by ritual humiliation, such as being stripped naked, smeared with filth and forced to eat excrement. For those accused of witchcraft who are not murdered, nearly all suffer permanent ostracism or banishment and their families face social stigma.\n\nIn Japanese folklore the witch can commonly be separated into two categories: those who employ snakes as familiars, and those who employ foxes.\n\nThe fox witch is by far the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the \"kitsune-tsukai\", and the \"kitsune-mochi\".\n\nThe first of these, the \"kitsune-tsukai\", gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The \"kitsune-tsukai\" then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of 'The Grateful Foxes'. However, once a fox enters the employ of a man it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared.\n\nA fox under the employ of a human can provide him with many services. The fox can turn invisible and be set out to find secrets and it still retains its many powers of illusion which its master will often put to use in order to trick his enemies. The most feared power the \"kitsune-tsukai\" possesses is his ability to command his fox to possess other humans.\n\nMagical girl genre may be the most commonly known to feature witchcraft, but it appears liberally in any works of fiction where such supernatural power can exist, despite the fact that such magic resembles more of western witchcraft than an oriental counterpart. Evil witch antagonists, borne out of the European concept of witch, are popular; however, their powers rarely stem from worshipping devils.\n\nAttempting to influence others through spells in Joseon was widely censured by the royal court. On discovering that Consort Hwi-bin Kim had used witchcraft on the crown prince, Sejong the Great described her as a \"sorcerer\" or \"evil monster\" () and had her thrown out of the palace.\n\nWitchcraft is a feature of traditional mythology in Kazakhstan and Tajikistan documented since the 16th century. It is believed that once a human dies their soul is owned by the witch that murdered them. \n"}

Only one version of BBC Two was available digitally, and this was shown throughout the UK. The BBC English Regions gradually became available via Digital Terrestrial Television (Freeview) over the next few years, as did the national versions of BBC Two. \n\nOn digital satellite television, regional news programmes on BBC One were replaced by \"UK Today\" until 28 January 2002 when additional transponder space was allocated the English regions. Initially programmes were available as an interactive service via the red button and only for the five largest English regions; London, North West, South, West Midlands and Yorkshire On 30 May 2003 the BBC stopped encrypting its TV channels on digital satellite and made all regions available as standard, full-time channels.\n\nRegional news inserts are broadcast during \"BBC Breakfast\" along with 15-minute shows on weekdays after national news bulletins at 1.30 pm and 10.30 pm, along with a 30-minute show at 6.30 pm. On weekends the availability of a regional news bulletin following the national news depends on the timeslot.\n\nIn England—other than regional news programmes—regional opt-outs include the documentary strand \"Inside Out\", a regional segment of \"Sunday Politics\" and in the northern regions (those based in Hull, Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle) \"The Super League Show\".\n\nElsewhere, additional local programming is broadcast; (notable examples include \"Give My Head Peace\" and \"Spotlight\" in Northern Ireland, \"River City\" and \"Sportscene\" in Scotland and \"Belonging\" and \"Crash\" in Wales) with network programmes rescheduled to accommodate them.\n\nBBC One HD started broadcasting on 3 November 2010.

Their work held general appeal and was also appreciated and promoted by Edoardo Persico and Giuseppe Pagano at Casabella. Along with the editor Valentino Bompiani, the BBPR group is credited for the original idea for the Italian Civilisation building. The selection of the Guerrini-La Padula-Romano project was fraught with polemics since it is argued that their eulogy to the most Roman of architectural motif - the arch - is what won them first prize, a prize which some say deservedly belonged to the Milanese architects. Their adherence to Fascism was short-lived and they soon became members of the resistance: Banfi and Belgiojoso were imprisoned at the Mathausen concentration camp where Banfi died and Rogers, being of Jewish descent, was forced into exile in Switzerland.\n\nThe practice continued under the same name after the Second World War despite the death of Banfi in Mauthausen concentration camp.\n\nThe firm came to notice after World War II with the abstract design for the Monument to the Victims of Nazi Concentration Camps, erected within the Cimitero Monumentale di Milano.\n\nBBPR reacted against the polemic of the International Style in 1954, with the creation of the Torre Velasca in Milan, complete with its abstract medieval references. The tower responds to its prominent location near the Milan Cathedral in the city's historic centre.\n\nThe firm were subsequently employed to create new interior spaces and exhibition designs for the museums housed within Milan's Castello Sforzesco which had been severely damaged by allied bombing in 1943.\n\n\n"}

The service is a \"Push video on demand\" (push VoD) system similar to Top Up TV's TV Favourites, where the Sky+ PVR automatically records programmes transmitted over-night. The service uses 140GB of previously reserved disk space on Sky+ HD boxes hard-disk space whilst on standard Sky+ boxes it uses 80GB of the hard-disk space. The service is intended to provide a catch-up of a selection of the last week's programming. The service was launched on PVR3 Sky+ boxes manufactured by Pace and Amstrad on 24 April 2007. The update for Thomson boxes was delayed because of technical difficulties, it was finally launched for Thomson boxes on 29 May 2007.\n\nOn 30 July 2009, Sky confirmed the launch of a 'pull' video-on-demand service for 2010, adding to the Sky Anytime 'push' VOD service. On 29 April 2010, Sky revealed that it will name its video-on-demand service Sky Anytime+. \"It will be a broad offering at launch with a large range of content across the range of content that we show,\" CEO Jeremy Darroch said. \"(It will feature) progressive download using the broadband return pathway and the hard disc in a combined way. All of the boxes are VOD-ready, so we'll be able to roll it out to all of the box population.\" Sky Anytime+ began a staggered roll out from 26 October 2010, The majority of Sky's customers were able to receive the service by the end of 2010. In the phased rollout, all remaining receivers were enabled in the first part of 2011. A background over-the-air update in 2010 upgraded all existing Sky+ HD boxes with the software needed to run Anytime+.\n\nIn July 2011, Sky Anytime was added to Virgin Media with content from Sky Living, following on from Sky's purchase of Virgin Media Television. Additional content began rolling out on 11 October 2011 ahead of a full launch the following day. Programming is available in both standard and high definition from Sky1, Sky Arts, Sky Living, Sky Movies, Sky News and Sky Sports. However HD content from premium channels is limited to TiVo subscribers. Sky Anytime content also became available through Virgin Media Player online on 28 October 2011 but not on mobile devices.\n\nOn 6 September 2012, Sky announced that Sky Anytime and Anytime+ would be merged and rebranded as \"On Demand\", along with the addition of a \"Catch-up TV\" section. This occurred on 26 September 2012, with Sky Anytime becoming a \"Showcase\" section and Sky Anytime+ being split into \"Library\", \"Movies\" and \"Sky Store\".\n\nOn 11 October 2012, the download component of the on Demand service was activated in Ireland, where Anytime+ had previously been unavailable.\nIn 2015 the kids area of on demand started.\n\nOn Demand offers around 1,000 hours of content from Sky 1, Sky Atlantic, Sky Arts, Sky Living, Sky Movies and Sky Sports, along with material from other broadcasters, such as the Disney Channel, ESPN, HBO, National Geographic and UKTV. A \"key focus\" for the service is movies, with around 500 made available at the launch of Sky Anytime+. On Demand is offered without charge to all Sky customers with Sky+ HD boxes, although access to premium content such as sport and movies will depend on the subscriber's package. All Anytime+ content was initially only available in standard definition, with high definition VOD content via Sky Anytime. However, Sky's head of TV services Kathryn Downward said that Anytime+ could offer HD content in the future and 3D on-demand was \"definitely something we are considering\" and HD content was later made available. So far, more HD content has been added from both Sky and the BBC. On 1 September 2011, a further 10 channels were added to the service.\n\nITV Player became accessible through the main Sky Anytime+ menu as well as a dedicated ITV Player section on 31 January 2012, featuring archive content. The catch-up TV section of on Demand launched on 26 September 2012, featuring ITV Player, Demand 5, Sky TV (Sky1, Sky Arts, Sky Atlantic and Sky Living), Sky Sports and Sky Movies. BBC iPlayer arrived on 30 October 2012, while 4oD launched on 18 March 2013.\n\nDownload content in on Demand is supported by progressive download, meaning it downloads in the background while the user is watching. Standard definition movies are typically around 1.3GBs, which takes about one minute to start playing on 2Mbit/s+ connections, but around 40mins on sub-1Mbit/s lines. Downloads can also be paused if the user wants to free up their broadband line for another task. However, Anytime+ was initially only made available to Sky customers with a Sky Broadband connection, meaning anyone on another internet service provider missed out. Downward said that the reasoning behind this strategy is to enable the \"optimum experience\" for customers and make it easier to manage technical issues. On 20 March 2012, Sky Anytime+ was made available across all broadband providers.\n\nContent requiring a download is managed in the existing Sky+ Planner tool. Users are able to trigger multiple downloads of content at one time, which all funnels into the Planner. The system handles one download at a time, with users able to shuffle their download list to prioritise different content. If users are watching Sky television, then the system also pops up a reminder to indicate when selected content is available to watch. Among notable new features on the user interface is a 'play' icon, which indicates that content is available to play immediately. However, any content not carrying the 'play' icon will require time to download before running entirely without buffering.\n\nA Wi-Fi adapter has also been made available, manufactured by Netgear, rebadged by Sky as the \"Sky Wireless Connector\".\n\nUnlike BT TV, On Demand's download content will contribute towards the user's broadband data limit. Downward said, \"To us any internet usage is still internet usage – however it's being delivered, if we did [differentiate between Anytime+ data and normal internet use] it could be confusing between what isn't and what is.\" Customers who sign up for on Demand and are on the Sky Broadband Everyday Lite package are warned about how much content (180 minutes) they can consume before they hit their cap and anyone with Anytime+ that does exceed the cap is reminded that the service is contributing to their data usage.\n\nThe download service was not available in Ireland upon launch but the service was made available on 11 October 2012.\n\nSky Go (formerly known as 'Sky Player', 'Sky Anytime on PC' and 'Sky By Broadband') was launched in January 2006. The service allows customers to download video onto their PC through a broadband internet connection. As of November 2008 the software also allows the live streaming of selected Sky TV channels. The VoD content comprises sport highlights, news, feature-length movies and TV programmes. On 6 July 2011, Sky Player and Sky Mobile TV services were merged and rebranded as Sky Go.\n\n\"The Big New Preview Show\" was a programme shown on Sky Anytime, presented by Jason Barlow, which advertises the shows coming up on the following week. It was updated each week on a Sunday.\n\nSky HD viewers received a slightly different programme, \"The Big New HD Preview Show\", which showcased upcoming high definition content on both Sky Anytime on TV and the linear HD channels.\n"}

Polylateral Development focuses on supporting systematic and sustainable lateral flows of knowledge and resources among and between developing countries to promote socio-economic growth and development.\n\nThe main feature of Polylateral Development, as opposed to more traditional bilateral or multilateral development, is the absence of any single agency or organization (IMF, World Bank, USAID etc.) in determining the direction that is taken by developing nations in regard to the creation of policy. It is a peer-to-peer development strategy, with participants choosing policy area focus based on their own needs, and then looking for guidance or lessons from others who may have experience in those same areas.\n\nA good example of Polylateral Development in action can be seen in the work of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. AFI is a knowledge sharing network of developing nations focused on expanding access to the formal financial sector and has often been credited with coining the Polylateral Development term. (Although 'polylateralism' in relation to international relations was first used by Geoffrey Wiseman in his paper “Polylateralism” and New Modes of Global Dialogue) The members of the network are all from developing countries and join in order to learn lessons from other developing countries about different kinds of financial inclusion policy experiences, so as to improve or develop their own development efforts. Rather than having direction imposed upon them by international organizations or developed countries, the members of AFI determine their priorities and direction through consultation with other members (using forums, working groups and one to one meetings), and then develop policy based on the specific needs of their populations and the capacity of their countries.\n\n"}

This proposal is pushed by two above mentioned parties as a new governorate for all minorities living there. Various estimates say that new province population will have the following ethno-religious makeup:\n\nDuring June, 2017, a conference was held in Brussels dubbed, \"The Future for Christians in Iraq\". The conference was organised by the European People's Party and had participants extending from Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac organizations, including representatives from the Iraqi government and the KRG. The conference was boycotted by the Assyrian Democratic Movement, Sons of Mesopotamia, Assyrian Patriotic Party, Chaldean Catholic Church and Assyrian Church of the East. A position paper was signed by the remaining political organizations involved. \n\nSupport – The proposal has been backed by the majority of Shia Arabs and Kurdish parties.\n\nSome foreign governments and political parties have also weighed in on the issue:\n\nOppose – It has been opposed by Sunni Arabs who make up the majority of the city of Mosul.\n\nSome Assyrian organizations also call for a creation of an Assyrian Administrative Region in Northern Iraq, which would include the following districts:\n\n\nSeveral Assyrian political parties convened to sign a position paper on the 6th of March 2017 relating to the future of the Nineveh Plains. The position paper called for the creation of a Nineveh Plains province that is self-governed by the Assyrian population of the Nineveh Plain.\n\nMany Kurdish politicians have publicly come out in support of annexing the area to the Kurdistan Regional Government as their fourth governorate (after Dohuk, Erbil and Slemani). Some Assyrians claim Masoud Barzani's KDP is intimidating the population into demanding their region be annexed. This is a controversial issue and the population has different views on the matter as revealed by a WikiLeaks document released in 2011:\nSome Assyrian political parties have called for the establishment of an Assyrian governed Nineveh Plains province as part of the KRG. The province would include the districts of Tel Keppe District, Al-Hamdaniya and Shekhan, and would be governed by the local Assyrian population of the region. Parts of the Nineveh Plain has illegally annexed and been under the jurisdiction of the KRG and Peshmerga, leading to the inclusion of sections of the Nineveh Plain as a \"disputed area\" and thus the KRG referendum, 2017 will take place in this occupied territory.\n\nOn March 5, 2017, three bodies representing Assyrians, Yazidis and Turkmen issued a joint statement calling for a semi-autonomous region in Northern Iraq. The idea was pushed forward by the Turkmen Rescue Foundation, Yazidi Independent Supreme Council and the Al-Rafidain Organization. \n\nThe project was proposed in line with Iraq’s 2005 Constitution, which gives minorities the right to autonomy or self-administration in sub-units of territory (Chapter 1; Sections 5, 112, 115 and 116).\n\n“The proposal of a region for the minorities is in line with the Iraqi Constitution and doesn’t contradict the general move to share powers and or let minorities manage their own affairs”, said Ali Akram Al-Bayati of the Turkmen Rescue Foundation.\n\nThe canton would comprise three continuous regions: Sinjar, Tal Afar and the Nineveh Plain. \n\n"}

It was formed by the Muslim rebel movement Séléka on 14 December 2015.\n\nIn March 2013, during the Central African Republic Civil War which began in a year earlier, the Muslim Séléka rebels forced the Christian president of the Central African Republic François Bozizé from his office. This resulted in violence from the Christian anti-balaka militias. The UN sent in MINUSCA troops and scheduled a constitutional referendum for 13 December 2015 and national elections on 27 December in order to stabilise the country. However, Noureddine Adam, the leader of the Central African Renaissance (FPRC), one of the four Muslim Séléka militias, abstained from the scheduled elections. In his view, Muslims and Christians could no longer live together in one country. On December 14, 2015, Adam's spokesman, Maouloud Moussa, declared the autonomous Republic of Logone in the northeast of the country. He explained that they wanted first to achieve autonomy within the Central African Republic and eventually absolute independence.\n\nLater, it was announced that the name of the new republic was \"Dar El Kuti\". The name was taken from the historic Dar El Kuti sultanate. The flag of Dar El Kuti was already set the next day in several villages such as Tiringoul, Ndifa and Mele. For the weekend, flag ceremonies were planned in Kaga-Bandoro, N'Délé, Bria and Birao. The flag shows three horizontal stripes in yellow (for the gold of the North), black (that the north was abandoned by the government in Bangui) and green (for the fertility of the land). In the centre of the black strip is a black star. It stands for the struggle of the people in the north for their self-determination. The rebel flag raised by local gendarmerie was taken down in the town of N'Délé by UN peacekeepers.\n\nLouisa Lombard, a professor of anthropology at the Yale University, believes that it is possible that declaration of a new republic is a negotiating tactic for upcoming elections or a method for increasing influence, and that the rebels do not really believe that it is feasible to create a new state.\n"}

A diverse coalition of over 100 advocacy groups organized the event and attracted thousands of protestors calling for an end to the mass surveillance made public by Edward Snowden.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, the most popular sign was printed with the words \"Thank you, Edward Snowden\". Jesselyn Radack read a statement from Snowden which said, in part, \"This isn't about red or blue party lines, and it definitely isn't about terrorism. It's about being able to live in a free and open society ... elections are coming up, and we are watching you\", adding that elected officials should be \"public servants, not private investigators.\" The American Civil Liberties Union ran a column detailing its involvement and quoting a statement Snowden had provided to them in support of the event.\n\nOther speakers included former governor Gary Johnson and NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake.

Utixo is sometimes translated as \"wounded knee\". For an alternative pantheon see Khoikhoi mythology.\n\nOne story that has survived in Christian literature, was that Utixo sent a message to his people that death would not be eternal. He used a rabbit to carry the message. The rabbit became confused, reversed the message, and ended up telling men that they would not rise again. \n\nUtixo was the word that missionaries used for translating \"God\" into Khoikhoi. The Zulus call the God UNkulunkulu, the Great One, and uMvelangqangi, the one was before all were.\n\n"}
