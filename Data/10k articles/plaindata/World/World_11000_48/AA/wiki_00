In wartime, civilian property may be left behind or taken by the occupying state. In ancient times, such property was considered war loot, and the legal right of the winner. In the Fourth Geneva Convention Article 147, such action is defined as war crime: \"Grave breaches to which the preceding Article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected by the present Convention: willful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a protected person, compelling a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power, or willfully depriving a protected person of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in the present Convention, taking of hostages and extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.\"\n\nThe following list is incomplete.\n\nBangladesh: The Enemy Property Act was established to manage property of enemies (Indians) taken while it was part of Pakistan (1948–1971) or during its independence war (1971).\n\nCanada The Office of the Custodian of Enemy Property was established in 1916 and existed until 1985, dealing with the property of Canada's enemies in both World Wars as well as the seized property of Japanese Canadians.\n\nIndia: The Custodian for Enemy Property for India was established to manage Pakistani property taken in the Second Kashmir War (1965).\n\nJordan: The Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property was established to handle property taken from Jews in the West Bank taken in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War (1948). In 1967, this function was disbanded (see below).\n\nIsrael: The 'Absentees Property Law' were established to handle the property taken from Palestinian refugees (including refugees who later became citizens of Israel, called \"present absentees\") of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War (1948) under the office of the Israeli Custodian of Absentee Property. During the Six-Day War (1967), along with previously Palestinian properties, Israel took control of the Jewish property held by the Jordanian Custodian for Enemy Property and put it under the control of their own Custodian of Absentee Property. Most of this property remains under the Custodian, while some (as in the Sheikh Jarrah case) has been granted to Jews contesting ownership, after claiming it in court.\n\nUnited States: Office of Alien Property Custodian was an office within the United States federal government during World War I and again during World War II.\n\nUnited Kingdom: Custodian of Enemy Property. Previously under the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914 enemy property was inspected by the Board of Trade and ownership was transferred to the Public Trustee. Initially, the Public Trustee held ownership on trust for the enemy but after a 1916 amendment the Public Trustee was required to sell the assets and hold the proceeds in trust. Under the Trading with the Enemy Act 1939, three custodians were established: England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland.

Dates are generally and officially written on the form YYYY-MM-DD, for instance 2001-08-31 for 31 August 2001, or using the full format (). Dates can also be shortened, allowing for two-digit years, so the dates are usually written on the form YY-MM-DD, which means that 31 August 2001 also can be written as 01-08-31. One can also omit the hyphens, leaving the notation to 010831.\nOlder forms for 31 August 2001 are 31/8 2001, or with the two-digit notation 31/8 -01. The common trait for all Swedish date notations is that the month (August or 8) always is between the year (01) and the day (31st). Months are not capitalised when written using letters (i.e. , not ).\n\nThe “month day, year” notation: (“08-31-2001”) is not used in Sweden, but may be used in Lule Sami, Northern Sami and Southern Sami languages.\n\nNumbering of weeks are frequently used in companies and schools, and are simply expressed as in \"() 32\" (\"(week) 32\") in both writing (abbreviated ) and speech. On labels and in computers' notation, the year may also be included, as in \"2006W32\". As in the ISO standard, the week begins with a Monday and week 1 is the week containing the year's first Thursday.\n\nTimes are written with the 24-hour clock, with full stops as separators (although colons are sometimes used instead of full stops), however seconds are usually left out if the additional precision is not required. Example: , or sometimes . Leading zeros are mostly used in time notation (i.e. 04.00 is more common than 4.00). In spoken Swedish however, the 12-hour clock is much more common. Usually time is expressed in 5-minute intervals (rounded so that it can be evenly divided by 5) like this: \"<the hour>\", \"<5, 10 or 20 [minutes]> <past, to> <the hour/the following hour>\", \"a quarter <past, to> <the hour/following hour>\", \"half <the following hour>\" or \"five <past, to> half <the following hour>\". More accurately like this: \"<1-29 [minutes]> past <the hour>\", \"half <the following hour>\" or \"<29-1 [minutes]> to <the following hour>\". In these styles, the word for \"minutes\" is usually but not always left out. Finally the written notation can be pronounced as is: \"<the hour> and <the minute>\", although this is not very common in everyday conversation. The 24-hour time is always applied on the last form, may be applied to the second form and is never used with rounded time as in the first form. Seconds are very seldom expressed at all in speech. Example: 14.27 may be pronounced as \"\" (\"three minutes to half three\"), \"\" (\"twenty seven (minutes) past two/fourteen\"), or, most commonly: \"\" (\"fourteen and twenty seven\"). 16.00 may be pronounced as \"\" (\"four\") or \"\" (\"sixteen\").\n"}

The name stems from Arthur Dillon (1750-1794) a soldier with Lafayette's troops in the American War of Independence. Serving with Dillon's Regiment, of the Irish Brigade (France), he had been created a colonel at the age of 16.\n\nOn returning to his home from the war, he married a rich widow, named Louise.

She married General Bertrand, and they both accompanied Napoleon into exile on Elba and St Helena. On returning to the Dillon Plantation, she campaigned against slavery.\n\nThere are ten varieties of sugar cane used by Dillon. The cane is grown for two years and when harvested the sugar is extracted over a period of 2 to 3 days. Speed is essential. The saying goes \"the cane should have its feet in the earth and its head in the mill\" The cane is crushed three times to release the juice by a steam engine driven mill. Water is added and the juice is allowed to ferment- it is again milled to crush the sugar, and fermentation starts. The residue cane is used to fire the boilers that provide the steam.

He taught at the University of California, Berkeley, in the departments of Sociology and History for 38 years, and he also served a term as the head of the Center for Chinese Studies. He was an early opponent of the Vietnam War, and was the first American professor to visit Hanoi during the bombing raids there. He co-founded the Pacific News Service in 1970 together with author Orville Schell, serving as editor and commentator, and wrote the weekly \"Predictions\" column.\n\nSchurmann was born on June 21, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York, and grew up in Bloomfield, Connecticut. He developed fluency in as many as 12 languages, acquiring them from his Slovenian father who spoke five languages himself, his mother who was an immigrant from Germany, and from the dialects spoken in the melting pot community where he was raised. He briefly attended Trinity College in nearby Hartford, Connecticut. He was drafted by the United States Army during World War II and was assigned to learn Japanese, serving as a newspaper censor during the American occupation of Japan. He befriended Stefan Brecht during his Army service and met Thomas Mann and other German émigrés at the California home of Stefan's father Bertolt Brecht. After completing his military service Schurmann was awarded a Ph.D. in Asian studies from Harvard University, which he was able to attend using his G.I. Bill benefits as a veteran.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, Schurmann spent two years exploring Afghanistan on horseback, where he documented a blue-eyed, blond-haired tribe that descended from the invasions by Genghis Khan, a history that he recounted in his 1962 book \"The Mongols of Afghanistan: An Ethnography of the Moghôls and Related Peoples of Afghanistan\". He was an early opponent of the Vietnam War, founding the Berkeley Faculty Peace Committee in 1965 and visiting North Vietnam with author and political activist Mary McCarthy in 1968. In 1967, Schurmann signed a letter declaring his intention to refuse to pay taxes in protest against the U.S. war against Vietnam, and urging other people to also take this stand.\n\nHis major work \"Ideology and Organization in Communist China\" was published in 1966, just as Mao's Cultural Revolution was starting, and was revised and enlarged in 1968 and 1971. A widely influential analysis, the book applied the sociological insights of Max Weber to interviews Schurmann conducted in Hong Kong with refugees and wide reading in Chinese newspapers and documents. The book demonstrates how Mao Zedong's \"dialectical conception of Chinese society\" structured his organizational approach to the Chinese Communist Party and the government. The book argued that a \"consistent yet changing ideology\" created a web of organization which covered and penetrated all aspects of Chinese society, building from the 1930s. He edited the three-volume series \"The China Reader\" with Orville Schell, a student of his who became an author and China expert in his own right. Together with Schell, he established the Pacific News Service in 1970, with the goal of providing Americans with more detailed coverage of news from Asia and Latin America. The service created New America Media in 1996, a multimedia ethnic news agency and a coalition of ethnic media.\n\nHis 1974 work \"The Logic of World Power\" provided a summary of international relations following World War II. \"The Foreign Politics of Richard Nixon\", a book he wrote in the 1970s about the U.S. President's role in foreign affairs, was not published until 1987.\n\nAs he developed his thinking about global power and economy, he expanded his skills to keep abreast of world developments. Already fluent in French, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and other languages, he now in his sixties learnt enough written Arabic to be able to read the Koran and the Arab-language press. This enabled him to write hundreds of columns for Pacific News, reporting on the development and goals of militant Islam.\n\nHe died at age 84 on August 20, 2010, at his home in San Francisco due to complications of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. He is survived by his wife of 42 years, journalist Sandy Close, as well as by two sons, Peter and Mark Schurmann, his daughter-in-law Aruna Lee, and his grandson Leon.\n"}

It was only published as a single volume in 1989. It is the sequel to \"Diary of a Short-Sighted Adolescent\" (Romanian: \"Romanul adolescentului miop)\", which is based on Eliade's time in high school. \n\n\"Gaudeamus\" will be published in English for the first time in April 2018 by Istros Books, with a foreword by Bryan Rennie. \n\nAs Bryan Rennie writes in the Foreword of the 2018 English edition: \"Mircea Eliade’s \"Gaudeamus\", written between February and March of 1928, is a coming-of-age novel based on his undergraduate years at the University of Bucharest (1925 to 1928). His earlier novel, \"Romanul adolescenului miop\" (\"Diary of a Short-Sighted Adolescent\", Istros Books, 2014) had focused on the final years of his \"Liceu\" (high school) education and had been serialised in its entirety in the Bucharest periodicals \"Cuvântul\", \"Viața Literară\", and \"Universul Literar\" in the ’20s, but the manuscript of \"Gaudeamus\" had a different trajectory. Finished before Eliade’s departure for India in 1928, it remained among his papers in the family house on Strada Melodiei in Bucharest. Only three pages, described as an “excerpt” from \"Gaudeamus\", appeared in \"Viața literară\" in March of 1928. Eliade attempted without success to place the manuscript with the publisher, Cartea Românească, but the novel was to wait more than fifty years to appear in print. Eliade did revisit and reread it in 1932-33, when, according to his \"Autobiography\", he found it “both lyrical and frenzied, too pretentious, timidly indiscreet, and quite lacking in grandeur”. He never again tried to have it published, nor, indeed to have any contact with it. The house was demolished in 1935 and the manuscript passed into the possession of his younger sister Cornelia (Corina) Alexandrescu. It was not until 1981 that a high school teacher and Eliade enthusiast, Mircea Handoca, along with the philosopher, essayist, and poet, Constantin Noica, were given access to Mme. Alexandrescu’s attic and recovered the manuscript. Together they assembled the first 2,500 typed pages of Eliade’s writings from 1921 up to 1928.

Game coverage still used CBS coverage and announcers, though DirectTV promotional advertising replaced CBS station local breaks and the games were uninterrupted by in-game analysis or a cut-over to a more compelling game like was done on the main CBS broadcasts.\n\nIn many markets however, CBS also provided sub-feeds of games for affiliates to air on digital subchannels or secondary sister stations. Though these games featured regular advertising and analysis and were only aired in standard definition, it was regarded as duplicative and as the stations offered the coverage for free, Mega March Madness was among the lowest-subscribed DirectTV sports packages as many viewers utilized a secondary cable connection or antenna to receive the games without charge, although in latter years CBS only allowed stations coverage of one further game on a digital subchannel to protect the Mega March Madness package. Further development of streaming of all games over video on demand on the Internet cut further into the package's appeal.\n\nAfter the 2010 tournament, Mega March Madness was discontinued, as the NCAA's new tournament deal with CBS and the networks of Turner Broadcasting System (TBS, TNT, and truTV), called NCAA March Madness, facilitated national coverage of every game on a cable or broadcast channel without cut-aways or staggered scheduling, making the Mega March Madness package superfluous.\n\n"}
