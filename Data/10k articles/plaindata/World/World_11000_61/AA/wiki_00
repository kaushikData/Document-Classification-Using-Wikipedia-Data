The station was believed to be operated by the British Secret Intelligence Service and to have emanated from Australia. It was thought to have previously broadcast from Guam. It consisted of an electronically synthesised English-accented female voice reading groups of five numbers, e.g. \"3-5-7-6-1\". The final number in each group was spoken at a higher pitch. It is likely that the station was used to communicate messages to undercover agents operating in other countries, to be decoded using a one-time pad.\n\nCherry Ripe had a more famous and much more active Middle-Eastern cousin, the Lincolnshire Poacher, which also used several bars from the English folk song of the same name as its interval signal. The Lincolnshire Poacher had long been suspected as being operated by Britain and had been detected as emanating from RAF Akrotiri on Cyprus. Apart from the interval signal, the format and voice of the two stations was identical, though as of July 2008 the Lincolnshire Poacher appears to no longer be active. In September 2009, Cherry Ripe moved their transmitter to Humpty Doo, Australia.\n\nThis schedule was accurate as of January 2006. All times are UTC, frequencies MHz.\n"}

{"id": "24197892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24197892", "title": "Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV", "text": "Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV\n\nHybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) is both an industry standard (ETSI TS 102 796) and promotional initiative for hybrid digital TV to harmonise the broadcast, IPTV, and broadband delivery of entertainment to the end consumer through connected TVs (smart TVs) and set-top boxes. The HbbTV Association, comprising digital broadcasting and Internet industry companies, has established a standard for the delivery of broadcast TV and broadband TV to the home, through a single user interface, creating an open platform as an alternative to proprietary technologies. Products and services using the HbbTV standard can operate over different broadcasting technologies, such as satellite, cable, or terrestrial networks.\n\nHbbTV can show digital television content from a number of different sources including traditional broadcast TV, Internet, and connected devices in the home. To watch hybrid digital TV, consumers will need a hybrid IPTV set-top box with a range of input connectors, including Ethernet as well as at least one tuner for receiving broadcast TV signals. The tuner in a hybrid set-top box can be digital terrestrial television (DVB-T, DVB-T2), digital cable (DVB-C, DVB-C2) and digital satellite (DVB-S, DVB-S2).\n\nThe HbbTV Consortium (later HbbTV Association) was born in February 2009 from the French H4TV project and the German HTML profil project. HbbTV was first demonstrated in 2009, in France by France Télévisions and two developers of Set Top Box technologies, Inverto Digital Labs of Luxembourg, and Pleyo of France, for the Roland Garros tennis sport event on a DTT transmission and an IP connection and in Germany using the Astra satellite at 19.2° east during the IFA and IBC exhibitions.\n\nIn May 2011, in an email sent on behalf of the HbbTV Consortium steering group, supporters of the consortium were invited to become full members. The transitional arrangements towards the opening of membership would involve withdrawal of a number of privileges, including participation in meetings and contribution to further versions of the specification, from supporters that did not sign up. The cost of membership was around €7,000 for the first year.\n\nIn June 2014, the HbbTV Association merged with the Open IPTV Forum, a similar industry organisation for end-to-end Internet Protocol television (IPTV) services formed in 2007, which worked closely with the HbbTV initiative on browser and media specifications for network-connected televisions and set-top boxes. The two initiatives were combined under the HbbTV Association’s banner because the markets for IPTV, OTT and hybrid broadcast and broadband TV are converging.\n\nIn September 2016 it was announced that the Smart TV Alliance, founded in 2012 by LG Electronics, Panasonic, Toshiba and TP Vision, was to merge with HbbTV, extending the scope of the HbbTV specification to address over-the-top services and to streamline standards. The merger is expected to be finalised within a year.\n\nServices delivered through HbbTV include enhanced teletext, catch-up services, video-on-demand, EPG, interactive advertising, personalisation, voting, games, social networking, and other multimedia applications.\n\nAt the May 2010 Broadcast and Beyond Conference in London, Thomas Wrede, VP Product Management Media at SES, said that he expected HbbTV devices to be launched commercially from June 2010 with a consumer market introduction at the IFA consumer electronics trade fair in Berlin in September 2010. Wrede also noted that Humax and Videoweb both had conformant products and that at the recent ANGA Cable trade fair in Cologne, 12 manufacturers exhibited HbbTV devices, with another six working on product introduction.\n\nHbbTV devices enables consumers to view all of these advanced services on their TV, via a single device. In addition to a broader range of content from TV providers – ranging from traditional broadcast TV, video on-demand and catch-up TV services, like BBC iPlayer – hybrid digital TV also provides consumers with access to user-generated content either stored on an external hard drive, or cloud storage, and to a range of advanced interactive services and Internet applications.\n\nHybrid set-top boxes are increasingly commonplace amongst pay-TV operators, as they look to meet the changing media consumption trends for more video content, advanced interactivity and internet applications, like social networking. Operators like n, a division of ITI Neovision in Poland, and Telekom Austria are two of the leaders in the deployment of hybrid set-top boxes. The 2010 IPTV World Forum Awards recognized a hybrid solution as the best interactive TV service/application: the solution, developed by Advanced Digital Broadcast, is the first three-way hybrid platform that enables content delivered via Satellite, Terrestrial and Ethernet networks to be viewed on a television.\n\nThe HbbTV consortium has over 50 supporting members from the CE and Broadcast industries, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HbbTV Association steering group currently comprises representatives from: Cellnex Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Digital TV Group, EBU, Eurofins Digital, Freesat, IRT, LG, Opera Software, Reti Televisive Italiane, RTL Group, Samsung, Sony, Tivù Sat, TNO, and TP Vision.\n\nAs well as helping consumers/viewers, the introduction of the HbbTV standard is of benefit to both equipment manufacturers and content providers who at the moment have to produce hardware or content specific to each country to meet the de facto standard in that country. The establishment of a unified European HbbTV standard means \"content owners and application developers can write once and deploy to many countries\".\n\nThe HbbTV specification was developed by industry members of the consortium and is based on elements of existing standards and web technologies including the Open IPTV Forum, CEA, DVB, and W3C.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union General Assembly has given its support to the HbbTV initiative and described the technology as \"one of the most exciting developments in the media today\".\n\nThe standard specification has been submitted by the end of November 2009 to ETSI, who published it under reference ETSI TS 102 796 in June 2010. There is an accompanying Test Suite that provides a set of test material to test HbbTV device implementations, suitable for manufacturers of devices, including software and hardware components that implement the HbbTV specification (ETSI TS 102 796 v1.1.1). In November 2012 Eurofins Digital Testing (then Digital TV Labs) became the first Registered Test Centre.\n\nThe applications for HbbTV are HTML-based, making use of HTML5 and the CE-HTML user interface language, but utilise only a sub-set of standard web standards, developers have to use specialist validation tools.\n\nIn September 2017 the HbbTV Association announced the publication of its IPTV specification by ETSI as TS 103 555. This specification builds on HbbTV 2.0 and defines how audio-visual content delivered by an IPTV service can be presented on HbbTV terminals (such as set-top boxes and televisions) - both hybrid terminals with an IP connection and an RF-based broadcast connection, and pure IPTV terminals with only an IP connection.\nThe next incremental version of the HbbTV standard is expected to include functionality from the MHEG-5 interactive middleware platform used for digital terrestrial TV in the UK, to facilitate the transition from MHEG-5 to HbbTV as the mandated system in the UK.\n\nSeveral countries worldwide, and in Europe in particular, have adopted the HbbTV standard and/or operated HbbTV services and trials. As of December 2011, HbbTV services were in regular operation in France, Germany and Spain, with announcements of adoption in Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Denmark, Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, Turkey, and trials in Australia, China, Japan, and the United States.\n\nAs of October 2015, 27 countries have launched HbbTV services with the most recent being the UK, New Zealand, Senegal, Namibia, Bosnia and Estonia. In October 2014, the HbbTV Association announced that over 20 countries had launched HbbTV services with Italy and Saudi being the most recent to launch.\n\nIn 2010 German broadcaster RTL Television introduced a new information service, HD Text, making use of HbbTV and the CE-HTML user interface language, and in 2012 launched an online music video service (Clipfish Music) on its HbbTV portal allowing access to TV viewers.\n\nIn 2011 the Dutch national public networks, Nederland 1, 2, and 3 began broadcasting HbbTV \"red button\" applications including an program guide and catch-up TV instead of developing separate apps for particular platforms.\n\nIn France, the government-owned public broadcaster, France Télévisions selected HbbTV for its interactive news, sports and weather service, and plans to add catch-up TV and social media sharing capability. International French news channel France 24 has announced that it will launch an HbbTV interactive news service in 2012 via the Astra 19.2°E satellites, with support from Orange and SES.\n\nIn November 2011 Spain’s Ministry of Industry approved a document signed by 54 companies adopting the HbbTV standard and broadcasters, Mediaset España, Canal+ and Telefónica have run pilot services.\n\nThe first tests of HbbTV services in Poland were started by TVN in March 2012.\n\nIn the UK, the Freeview Play platform has been launched implementing an HbbTV 2.0 catch-up service on DVB-T/T2. Freesat, the free-to-air satellite TV service broadcast via Astra 28.2°E, has revealed that the second generation \"G2\" specification for Freesat receivers will use HbbTV, to take advantage of the digital TV chipsets being developed for that standard (but retaining MHEG-5 compatibility of the first generation Freesat receivers). While the Digital TV Group approved D-book 7, a detailed interoperability specification between digital terrestrial television and HbbTV-based products and services.\n\nIn Nordic region (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Ireland) the NorDig standardization forum has adopted the HbbTV specification which replaces DVB-MHP as the common API for hybrid digital receivers.\n\nIn Finland the national HDTV Forum has adopted the NorDig Unified Specification for Hybrid Services. The members of HDTV Forum see the HbbTV specification having a wide market acceptance supporting wide range of TV applications and new hybrid services. HbbTV services have been on air in Finland since March 2013 in the nationwide terrestrial TV network. Current services include 'red button' services and an enhanced programme guide application. Several broadcasters in Finland use the HbbTV platform. Those are Yle Nelonen Media and MTV. \n\nIn Switzerland the first HbbTV service, which is called \"RTS+\", was launched on March 5, 2013, on SRG SSR French speaking channels RTSun HD and RTSdeux HD. The service was developed by \"SwissTXT\".\n\nItaly had launched HbbTV services by October 2014.\n\nIn Estonia HbbTV was adopted in March 10, 2015.\n\nIn Greece HbbTV was adopted in November, 2016 by Cosmote TV.\n\nTurkish Radio and Television Corporation launched its HbbTV app, TRT Plus (), in 2014.\n\nIn Turkey, FOX TV and Kanal7 launched its HbbTV EPG app (Fox'da ne var?, Kanal7 yayın akisi) in 2016 and 2017 provided by Turkish HBBTV company Admongrel. Service was deployed with help of Castoola HbbTV platform.\n\nIn 2017 first interactive preroll advertisement campaign (Bosch advertisement) was launched by Admongrel, Adform and Kanal7.\n\nIn December 2017, the BBC launched a UK nationwide HbbTV broadcast service. The service provides users the opportunity to launch connected TV applications from broadcast as well as offering broadcast TV applications for radio stations.\n\nFreeview New Zealand launched its HbbTV platform in New Zealand in July 2015, under the registered trade mark name \"FreeviewPlus\", with their DVB-T service (Freeview|HD); followed by an extension to the DVB-S service (Freeview Satellite) in April 2016.\n\nSaudi Arabia had launched HbbTV services by October 2014.\nIn early 2015, several broadcasters in Turkey have reportedly begun using the HbbTV platform and services provided by Admongrel \n\nHbbTV is being reviewed and tested, with interest from US, Argentina, Japan, China (which is conducting a trial), Malaysian Broadcasters (where DVB-T2 broadcasting will soon start) and Singapore (where Mediacorp is introducing its service through Toggle).\n\nSince the beginning of 2010 a new generation of advanced HbbTV IPTV set-top box has emerged in the UK with the advent of DVB-T2 services. DVB-T2 tuners enable the reception of free-to-air terrestrial high-definition programmes to be received in around twelve areas of the UK.\n\nHigh definition digital terrestrial services have encouraged a range of device manufacturers to launch new hybrid set-top boxes for the UK consumer retail market. Some of these companies have launched devices that, in addition to allowing traditional broadcast and IP-delivered services to be received, have an integrated smart-card slot that allows consumers to receive encrypted Premium television services including sports and movies.\n\nSuch boxes enable the aggregation of traditional linear TV broadcasts with video delivered via both managed (cable) and unmanaged IP networks (the internet). This allows viewers to view broadcast television and internet video on their flat screen TVs, alongside advanced interactive services, such as video on demand, internet browsing, and time-shifted TV.\n\nA hybrid IPTV platform helps operators increase average revenue per user (ARPU), whilst eliminating expensive duplication in network infrastructure investment.

Thus, he proposes that everyone unite and think about things they can do to improve the world. The chorus is delivered in English, with the band singing that humanity as a whole has treated the world badly, having \"turned [it] upside down\". The theme of a call to action was made more explicit in the performance, with N!ki calling out \"Thank you! We can still save the world!\" after the song was finished.\n\nAs Andorra had not previously qualified for the final, the song was performed in the semi-final.

Like WWV, WWVH's main function is the dissemination of official U.S. Government time, through exactly the same methods as found on WWV's signal.\n\nTo minimize interference with the WWV broadcasts on the same frequencies, WWVH's broadcasts on 5, 10 and 15 MHz are directional, pointed primarily west. Despite this strategy, in certain places, particularly on the west coast of North America; and at certain times, due to ionospheric conditions, the listener can actually hear both WWV and WWVH on the same frequency at the same time. The information modulated on the carrier is modified to reduce confusion if both are received simultaneously. In particular, voice announcements on one correspond to silent periods on the other. WWVH uses a female voice to distinguish itself from WWV, which uses a male voice. WWVH time signals can also be accessed by telephone.\nWWVH broadcasts its signal on four transmitters, one for each frequency. The 2.5 MHz transmitter puts out an ERP of 5 kW, while the other transmitters use 10 kW of ERP. The 2.5 MHz antenna is one half-wavelength tall, and radiates in an omnidirectional pattern. The remaining antennas each consist of two elements one half-wavelength tall and horizontally separated by one quarter-wavelength. The signal radiating from one element is in quadrature phase with respect to the signal from the other. This results in a cardioid radiation pattern with a maximum gain directed west.\n\nThe WWVH signal is extremely similar to the WWV signal, but some changes have been made to reduce confusion if both are heard at once:\n\nWWVH identifies itself twice each hour, at 29 and 59 minutes past the hour. The text of the identification is as follows:\nReception reports sent to that address will on request be answered with a QSL card.\n\nWWVH's time signal can also be accessed by calling +1(808)335-4363.\n\n"}
