Despite Luxembourg's storied history in the Contest, which included five wins at that point, Carle was only the fourth singer to represent Luxembourg who was native to the Grand Duchy, the three previous being Solange Berry in 1958, Camillo Felgen in 1960 and 1962 and Monique Melsen in 1971.\n\nThe song is a ballad, with Carle asking to be given \"100% of love\" to maintain her sanity in the modern world. During the live performance, Carle allegedly had trouble keeping her own harmony over her loud keyboard and drum machine accompaniments, which led to a largely off-key performance.\n\nThe song was performed second on the night (following Sweden's Herreys with \"Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley\" and preceding France's Annick Thoumazeau with \"Autant d'amoureux que d'étoiles\"). At the close of voting, it had received 39 points, placing 10th in a field of 19.\n\nThe relatively unsuccessful representation by Carle on home turf caused her to place her singing career on permanent hiatus. Instead, Carle pursued an acting career, in which she is still active as of 2008.\n\nIt was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1985 Contest by Margo, Franck Oliver, Diane Solomon, Ireen Sheer, Malcolm and Chris Roberts with \"Children, Kinder, Enfants\".\n\n\n"}

Production began in 1994.\n\nBerau Coal operate three active mines (Lati, Sambarata and Binungan) at a single site in East Kalimantan. Estimated resources of about 2.6 billion tons, with probable and proven reserves estimated at 512 million tons (mt), lie within a single concession of around 118,400 hectares.\n\nAll three mines produce thermal coal, using conventional open pit mining techniques, primarily to supply the Chinese market.\n\nBerau Coal was once part of the assets of Asia Resource Minerals, the renamed Bumi Plc, which Vallar, British financier Nat Rothschild’s £700m cash shell, bought a stake in in July 2010.\n\nAfter a series of internal disputes, board room battles and court inquiries into “financial irregularities” at Berau Coal, Amir Sambodo agreed to resign in March 2015 as president director of Berau. However, he failed to relinquish the position and refused to allow Asia Resource’s chief financial officer, chief mining officer or his successor into the head office of Berau. For a while, Bumi executives acting on behalf of Rothschild only had limited access to Berau’s accounting systems and bank account information. \n\nIn 2010, Asia Resource Minerals accused Another former president director of Berau Coal, Rosan Roeslani, of embezzlement. During the preparation of Berau's annual results for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012, unexplained payments totalling $201 million were found to have been made in 2011 and 2012.

{"id": "370377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=370377", "title": "Dinotopia", "text": "Dinotopia\n\nDinotopia is a fictional utopia created by author and illustrator James Gurney. It is the setting for the book series with which it shares its name. Dinotopia is an isolated island inhabited by shipwrecked humans and sapient dinosaurs who have learned to coexist peacefully as a single symbiotic society. The first book was published in 1992 and has \"appeared in 18 languages in more than 30 countries and sold two million copies.\" \"Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time\" and \"Dinotopia: The World Beneath\" both won Hugo awards for best original artwork.\n\nSince its original publication, over twenty Dinotopia books have been published by various authors to expand the series. A live-action TV mini-series, a brief live-action TV series, an animated film, and several video games have also been released.\n\nGurney's assignments for \"National Geographic\" required him to work with archaeologists to envision and paint ancient cities that no one alive today has ever seen. This inspired him to imagine his own, so he painted \"Waterfall City\" and \"Dinosaur parade\". These were originally done as art prints for collectors. He later decided to create an imaginary island based on these paintings.\n\nRather than digital tools, Gurney used \"plein-air studies, thumbnail sketches, models photographed in costume and original cardboard or clay maquettes\" to create 150 oil paintings for his 2007 Dinotopia book. He called the series \"Dinotopia\": a portmanteau of \"dinosaur\" and \"utopia\".\n\nMany have claimed that some scenes in the film \"\" (particularly those in the city of Theed on Naboo) unfairly copy images from Gurney's books. Gurney acknowledges the resemblance but has remained positive about it. In 1994, director George Lucas had met with producers to discuss some of the concepts and visuals behind a \"Dinotopia\" movie that was never made.\n\nUpon the hidden island of Dinotopia, humans and dinosaurs live and work together in harmony with one another and with the Earth itself. It is a place of beauty and wonder lost to the rest of the world. The island is surrounded by a storm system and dangerous reefs that prevent safe travel to or from the island. Aside from a highly diverse ecosystem ranging from deserts to mountains to swamps, Dinotopia also has an extensive system of natural and man-made caves.\n\nThe dinosaurs, according to their own legends, have inhabited the island for millions of years, having sought shelter in the underground caverns during the climate changes that caused the extinction of dinosaurs elsewhere on the planet.\n\nThe caverns are referred to as the World Beneath, and many dinosaurs go there to die. According to legends, a half-man-half ceratopsian being named Ogthar climbed down there (where the sun is said to sleep at night) and stole pieces of it (known as \"sunstones\"), using them to create the empire of Poseidos and populating it with metal dinosaurs. However, the sea grew angry with the artificial city and rose to destroy it. It is implied that this is where the Atlantis myth originated.\nThe human population consists of shipwrecked travelers called \"Dolphinbacks\" (who are often rescued and brought to shore by \"Kentriodon\") and the descendants of such arrivals. As such, they often fall into cultural zones based on the societies from whence their ancestors came, creating a cultural landscape across the island that is both unified and incredibly diverse.\n\nDinosaurs are not the only prehistoric creatures on the island. In the higher regions of the Forbidden Mountains (a Himalaya-like mountain chain), woolly mammoths, ground sloths, chalicotheres, saber-toothed cats, and other prehistoric mammals can be found. Basal synapsids are present as well; at least one \"Lystrosaurus\" and one \"Edaphosaurus\" can be found in the city of Pooktook.\n\nPterosaurs are also common, especially the \"Quetzalcoatlus skybax\", which serve as steeds for the skybax messenger riders.\n\nThe seas surrounding the island are completely inhabited by prehistoric life such as plesiosaurs and trilobites, as well as an unknown species of dolphin.\n\nThe center of the island is made up of a dense rainforest called the \"Rainy Basin\". This place is where most of the island's large carnivores live, such as \"Giganotosaurus\", \"Tyrannosaurus\", and \"Allosaurus\". They are just as sentient as the other dinosaurs on the island but must be kept apart due to their instinctual need to hunt. They have their own language yet it is very deep and guttural and difficult even for other dinosaurs to speak or understand fluently. The Basin is cut off from the rest of the island by a series of retractable bridges. There are caravans that make passages through the basin and are made up by very large sauropod dinosaurs outfitted with heavy suits of armor studded with sharp spikes and carry offerings of meat to appease any carnivores they meet. Often, a dinosaur that senses it will die soon will make a pilgrimage to the basin and die there so that it may be eaten by the carnivores and continue to contribute to the good of the island as a whole. The carnivores are actually very respectful of this and always wait for the dinosaur to pass peacefully, never attacking them while alive. The basin is divided by packs of predators, one ruled by Giganotosaurs, the other ruled by Tyrannosaurs.\n\nThe Great Desert is a desert in the east that stretches from Chandara to Pteros. The gorges of the Amu River is where Canyon City is built.\n\nThe northern part of Dinotopia has the Backbone Mountains which runs across the eastern and western parts of Dinotopia where it forms the northern border of the Rainy Basin and ending at Crackshell Point. Many large mammalian species reside here. In addition, there is the Northern Plains at its northern coast.\n\nThe southern part of Dinotopia has Blackwood Flats, a lowland area where its visitors are targets of biting insects, poisonous snakes, a tiger-striped Allosaurus, and a red-faced Tyrannosaurus.\n\nBoth the eastern and western halves of the dinotopian society share responsibility equally and live under a common set of laws known as the Code of Dinotopia. The society is highly communal, lacking a monetary system or even a concrete concept of ownership. Individuals are educated from youth to be compassionate, co-operative, and generally conscious of others' needs. For example, food on the island is provided at no cost, but citizens take only what they need and leave the rest for others. Stealing or other crime is virtually non-existent.\n\n\n\"Dinotopia\" began as an illustrated children's book called \"Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time\". It was a cross-over success, appealing to both children and adult readers, which led James Gurney to write and illustrate three more books called \"Dinotopia: The World Beneath,\" \"Dinotopia: First Flight\" and \"Dinotopia: Journey to Chandara\". They all deal with the adventures of Arthur and Will Denison to one degree or another. These are considered the main books of the series and establish the fictional world in which the others are set. Gurney keeps abreast with recent paleontological discoveries and has written then-newly discovered dinosaurs into his books, for example, including \"Giganotosaurus\" in \"The World Beneath\" and \"Microraptor\" in \"Journey to Chandara\"\n\nA children's flip-up version of the first book was also issued.\n\nThe \"Dinotopia Digest\" series consists of sixteen young adult novels penned by several different authors. These books feature other characters who are not specifically involved with the events of the main books, although characters from the main books (particularly the Denisons) have appeared in minor or cameo roles.\n\nTwo full-length adult fantasy novels were also issued with Gurney's authority, written by Alan Dean Foster: \"Dinotopia Lost\" and \"The Hand of Dinotopia\".\n\nSeveral video games, as well as a TV mini-series, a short-lived TV series, and an animated children's movie, were also produced. These are also set in the \"Dinotopia\" universe, but do not tie in directly with the main series. Most of them take place in the modern world, unlike the books, which are mostly set in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe plot of the main \"Dinotopia\" books concerns Arthur Denison and his son, Will, and the various people they meet in their travels in Dinotopia. In the fashion of authors such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, the first and fourth books are written as if they were Arthur's journals, with Gurney going so far as to explain in the introductions how he happened to come across the old, waterlogged volumes.\n\nIn \"Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time\" (1992), the Denisons are shipwrecked near Dinotopia and, after making it ashore, are found by the people of the Hatchery. The Hatchery is a place where dinosaurs are born, tended by both dinosaurs and humans. The Denisons then set out to explore the island, hoping to find a means of returning to their old lives.\n\nArthur and Will undergo a broad journey, circling the island, as they endeavor to learn the customs and culture of their new neighbors. Arthur in particular develops an interest in the scientific accomplishments of the natives, which far exceed that of any human culture. Among the subjects he studies are the flora of the island, the partnership of its inhabitants, and the existence of a place known as the World Beneath. This World Beneath is an explanation for Dinotopians surviving the saurian extinction; according to the story, most of the Earth's dinosaurs were destroyed, whilst a few hid in vast underground caverns. These few became the original Dinotopians. No one has entered the World Beneath for centuries, but Arthur intends to do so.\n\nHis son Will, on the other hand, has chosen to train as a messenger of the sky; a Skybax rider, who lives in symbiosis with his mount, the great \"Quetzalcoatlus\" (nicknamed Skybax), a species of pterosaur. Training alongside Will is a girl called Sylvia, with whom Will falls in love. The natives refer to this and any other profound bond as \"Cumspiritik\", which literally means \"together-breathing.\" (Romana Denison of the later Dinotopia film series is said to be Will's daughter.)\n\nArthur, for his part, travels into the World Beneath, at the same time that Will and Sylvia are learning to fly with the Skybax. When he returns, he is fascinated by the ancient relics found there and is convinced that they may be key in enabling him to leave or explore the island.\n\nMeanwhile, Will and Sylvia learn and master Skybax flight. When at last they have been accepted as Riders, they travel to meet Arthur and his \"Protoceratops\" guide Bix, but are distracted on the way by a thunderstorm. Luckily, they survive and arrive on time to meet their kin. Will is at the time too young to marry Sylvia, but it is promised that they will. Arthur recognizes that his son has grown up, and they each accept the changes that are results of their new lives on the island.\n\n\nThe first sequel, \"Dinotopia: The World Beneath\" (1995) focuses mainly on Arthur Denison's return expedition to the World Beneath and opens with Will fly testing an invention of his father, the Dragoncopter – a steam engine ornithopter modeled on the dragonfly. The Dragoncopter fails and Will is narrowly saved by Cirrus, his Skybax mount, before the Dragoncopter plummets into a waterfall.\n\nAfter returning from his first expedition in \"A Land Apart From Time\", Arthur presents two items he discovered – a sunstone and half of a key – to the council at Waterfall City in an attempt to get a second expedition into the World Beneath.\n\nA musician named Oriana Nascava comes forward with the missing half of Arthur's key, claiming it to be a family heirloom. She is only willing to give it up if she is allowed to accompany Arthur in his expedition, a term that he reluctantly accepts. Together with Bix as a guide and the scandalous Lee Crabb, the group travels to the shady Pliosaur Canal where they board a submersible in order to take an underwater route to the World Beneath.\n\nMeanwhile, Will and Sylvia have been assigned to accompany a sauropod caravan through the Rainy Basin and keep a watch for predatory \"Tyrannosaurus\". However, Cirrus flies Will to ancient ruins in the jungle of which the \"Tyrannosaurus\" are strangely protective.\n\nArthur, Oriana, Bix, and Lee continue to explore the caverns underneath Dinotopia where they come across instantly germinating fern spores, uncut sunstones that appear to store ancestral memory, and mechanical limbs that twitch when the sunstone is brought near. Eventually, they reach an enormous man-made chamber filled with abandoned walking vehicles modelled after prehistoric animals, left behind by the ancient civilization of Poseidos, which they nickname \"Strutters\". Arthur, Oriana, and Bix commandeer a ceratopsian strutter while Crabb takes a strutter modeled after a sea scorpion and they both climb out of the World Beneath, ending up in the Rainy Basin. They join the sauropod convoy, but are attacked by a pack of \"Tyrannosaurus\" and \"Allosaurus\", during which Crabb escapes in his strutter and the head of the ceratopsian strutter is ripped off.\n\nAfter escaping the carnivores, Arthur realizes that the \"Tyrannosaurus\" at the ruins may have been guarding the mythical ruby sunstone, and takes his strutter back into the Rainy Basin with Oriana and Bix to discover it. Along the way, they come across a trapped juvenile \"Giganotosaurus\" and free it. The grateful father, named Stinktooth, protects Arthur and his companions from the tyrannosaurs and allows them passage into the ruins.\n\nInside the temple, Bix reveals that in the past, people have escaped the island and brought with them culture from Dinotopian civilizations, influencing ancient Egyptian and Greek civilizations.\n\nHowever, they are too late, as Crabb has arrived first and taken the ruby sunstone. Vowing to escape Dinotopia and bring back an army of strutters to plunder the island, he destroys Arthur's strutter with his sea scorpion and escapes. Riding on top of Stinktooth, Arthur chases Lee into the sea and pulls the sunstone out of the power socket in the strutter before Lee can escape. During this chase, Arthur's journal is lost to the ocean where it will be discovered by Philippine sailors and eventually make its way to the library where James Gurney discovers it.\n\nAt the end, the ruby sunstone is lost, a new romance is suggested between Arthur and Oriana, and Crabb is placed under guard by a pair of \"Stygimoloch\".\n\n\n\"Dinotopia: First Flight\" (1999) was a prequel published by Gurney and included a board game.\n\nThe main protagonist of the story is Gideon Altaire, a flight school student living in the capital city of Poseidos off the Dinotopian mainland, in which all organic life (save for humans) has been replaced by mechanical counterparts. After discovering an injured \"Scaphognathus\" named Razzamult, Gideon discovers that the city is planning to launch an attack on the mainland and conquer all of Dinotopia and that they have stolen the ruby sunstone from the pterosaur home of Highnest.\n\nGideon sneaks into a factory and discovers an enormous air scorpion attack strutter under construction. He locates and steals the ruby sunstone and frees a group of captive pterosaurs before escaping to the mainland in a police skimmer. He arrives only to find the island already under attack. He discovers and enlists the help of a band of indigenous creatures- Binny, a \"Necrolemur\", Bandy, a \"Plesictis\", Bongo, a \"Plesiadapis\", and Budge, an \"Estemmenosuchus\". During their trek towards Highnest, they are ambushed by a spider like attack strutter which proceeds to steal the ruby sunstone.\n\nGideon and his band reach Highnest, where they help the pterosaurs evacuate the eggs, then take to the air atop their pterosaurs to engage the air scorpion. During the battle, Gideon manages to pull the ruby sunstone out of the flying machine's power socket, causing it to crash and stopping the invasion of Dinotopia.\n\nGideon is presented as the first ever Skybax rider, although the species he rode wasn't a \"Quetzalcoatlus northropi\".\n\n\nA fourth Dinotopia book by James Gurney, \"Dinotopia: Journey to Chandara\", was published in October 2007. In it, Hugo Khan, the mysterious and reclusive emperor of Chandara, an empire long since isolated from the rest of Dinotopia, has heard of Arthur Denison and Bix's exploits and sends them a personal invitation to his court. Along the way, the duo encounter several new locals, including an old musician named Cornelius Mazurka and his companion \"Therizinosaurus\" Henriette in the ruins of an old city, a town called Bilgewater made completely out of salvaged ships that the inhabitants believe will carry them into another world, and Jorotongo, a consistently festive and completely nomadic village composed of pilgrims from the \"Sunflower\", sister ship to the \"Mayflower\".\n\nEventually, they meet Lee Crabb en route at Sauropolis, who escapes from his \"Stygimoloch\" guards and steals the invitation. Without proper passes for the border guards, Arthur and Bix are forced to sneak through the swamp of Blackwood Flats while evading packs of carnivorous \"Allosaurus\". After passing through the mountain city of Thermala, the duo encounter Neighbor Dooh, a bandit who steals all the possessions of passing travelers and compensates them with the possessions of the previous victim. Although Arthur loses all of his scientific equipment, he is given a set of desert robes which allow him and Bix to blend into a Chandaran caravan and pass the border without harassment from the guards.\n\nThey stop by the ruins of Ebulon, where Arthur finds Will and Sylvia preparing for an air-jousting tournament. Soon after that, they make their way to the capital city of Chandara. By the time they arrive, they find themselves with few possessions left to barter save for ideas, so Arthur sets up shop in the Marketplace of Ideas. During the night, the writings at Arthur's stand catches the attention of the emperor and he and Bix are invited into the court.\n\nOnce at the court, they discover that Lee Crabb has also entered the court under the guise of Arthur Denison and is attempting to gather up a stockpile of weapons, arguing that he is preparing for a \"Tyrannosaurus\" invasion. Hugo Khan finally reveals himself to be a small \"Microraptor\", and the real Denison promptly exposes Crabb. Khan punishes Crabb by assigning him to be a chef for a band of \"Acrocanthosaurus\" Shaolin-monks, who ate their last chef after he failed to satisfy them.\n\nTo commemorate Arthur and Bix's presence on the court, Hugo Khan flies out during the night to find a child in sorrow. The next day, Arthur, Bix, and a handful of the Emperor's selected entertainers arrive at the house of and greet Rita Rose and Jeffer, an orphaned \"Europasaurus\" hatchling who has lost the ability to walk. At the end of the day, Hugo Khan expresses his wish for Chandara to be reopened culturally to the rest of Dinotopia. Arthur and Bix accept the Emperor's offers to stay in Chandara for a while to fully discover the city and its culture.\n\n\nFrom 1995, James Gurney worked with a number of other authors on a series of short novels for children using the Dinotopia characters and themes, published by Random House:\n\n\n\nTwo full-length adult fantasy novels were also issued with Gurney's authority, written by Alan Dean Foster: \"Dinotopia Lost\" (1996) and \"The Hand of Dinotopia\" (1999).\n\nA 2002 four-hour TV mini-series produced by Hallmark Entertainment was also based on James Gurney's work, and was advertised as the first \"mega-series.\" The show featured new characters such as Zippo (changed to Zippeau for the TV series to avoid legal issues with the lighter maker Zippo), a troodon who is said to have worked with Sylvia; the sunstones, a technology restricted to the lost city of Poseidos in the books, are commonplace in the miniseries. The failure both of the sunstones and of Dinotopian officials to adhere to the underlying meanings of their culture's philosophy caused several discontented people – a leader-in-training, Zippeau himself, and two twentieth-century Dolphinbacks, Karl and David – to embark on a quest that led ultimately to the World Beneath. The series is presented as a sequel of sorts to the books: Will Denison's daughter followed her father into the Skybax corps (an order acknowledged to be founded by Gideon Altaire), Oriana's granddaughter is the female protagonist, the character Zippo is said to have been the dinosaur partner of Sylvia (here the Nursery overseer and not a Skybax rider), and Lee Crabb's son Cyrus features as the antagonist. The mini-series won an Emmy for its special effects.\n\nIn the world of Dinotopia, the Code of Dinotopia is an ancient stone tablet citing the rules of living in Dinotopia. As the part of the tablet cracked since it was first carved, the last portion of it had been missing, but was recovered in the TV mini-series \"Dinotopia\". The code itself is as follows:\n\nThe recovered first letters of each sentence spell out \"SOW GOOD SEED\". It was first written in the Dinotopian alphabet. In the TV mini-series, the 11th code began with \"Fin...\" and was found to be \"Find the light\".\n\nIn the original book by James Gurney, the last line of the code was a small joke amongst the historians and the librarian, who seemed to think it could have been \"Don't pee in the bath\" referencing the Saurian community's distaste with some humans' lack of cleanliness and hygiene. This was never elaborated on further or confirmed to be true though. Another theory is \"Don't put off work for tomorrow that can be done today\".\n\nA TV series of thirteen episodes was produced later in 2002 as a result of the success of the mini-series, but none of the cast of the mini-series reprised their roles. In the later TV series, a group of people known as Outsiders live outside the laws of Dinotopia and pose an additional danger aside from the featured antagonists, which include \"Pteranodon\", \"Tyrannosaurus\", and \"Postosuchus\".\n\nABC originally planned to launch the series in September 2002, but decided to wait until Thanksgiving. ABC was somewhat disappointed by the initial 5.7 million viewers and the poor ratings, but continued to air the series for a little while longer, pointing out that it had been an \"odd viewing night overall.\" The series was finally canceled in December. Only six of the thirteen episodes were aired on ABC, but all thirteen were broadcast the following year in Europe and were released onto a three-disc DVD box set.\n\nScience-fiction veteran David Winning directed two episodes of the series, and location shooting lasted for three months near Budapest, Hungary. Georgina Rylance played Marion Waldo, and Lisa Zane portrayed her old friend LeSage, the leader of the Outsiders. Michael Brandon, Jonathan Hyde, and Erik von Detten also star in the series.\n\nArtisan Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 for the first time on 20 January 2004. This release has been discontinued and is out of print. On 15 March 2016, Mill Creek Entertainment re-released the complete series on DVD in Region 1.\n\nThere is also a 2005 traditionally animated movie called \"\". This film deviated from the original books even more than the mini-series by featuring Ogthar, a mythical ruler of the World Beneath (mentioned in the mini-series), as a human warlord rather than a benevolent, if commanding, emperor.\n\nA number of \"Dinotopia\" video games have been produced:\n\n"}

Local dialects transformed it into \"Hyottoko\" (ひょっとこ), palatalizing \"hio\" to \"hyo\" and making the /t/ geminate.\n\nHyottoko seems to have been a legendary character in Japan in the past, and is now a stock character.\n\nIn Iwate Prefecture, there is a myth about the origin of Hyottoko. In the story, there was a boy with a bizarre face who could create gold out of his belly button, so when someone died in a house, you would put the mask of this boy at the top of the fireplace to bring good fortune to the house. The name of the boy was \"Hyoutokusu\" (ヒョウトクス). This is considered one of the possible names that lend plausibility to the origin of Hyottoko.\n\nIn some parts of north eastern Japan, Hyottoko is regarded as the god of fire. There is a well known folk story in the form of music, \"izumoyasugibushi\" (出雲安来節) where a fisherman dances with a bamboo basket, having the same visual expression as the mask of Hyottoko. During this dance, a person puts five yen coins on their nose. This is similar to myth of Iwate prefecture. Izumo is the old name of Iwate prefecture and Izumo was famous for its iron industry. The dance was part of a dedication for fire and steel. \n\nHyottoko also appears in traditional dance \"dengaku\" (田楽). He plays the role of a clown. Dancers wearing Hyottoko masks also appear in some Japanese local festivals. One of the most famous Hyottoko dances takes place in Miyazaki Prefecture - \"Hyuga Hyottoko Natsumatsuri\" (日向ひょっとこ夏祭り).

She has a strong record of continuous participation in international steering groups and oversight committees for collection and use of oceanographic data. Talley is a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union, The Oceanography Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nTalley was born May 18, 1954 in Schenectady, New York. She attended Marple-Newtown High School, Newtown Square, PA in 1971.\n\nShe received her B.A. in Physics in 1976 from Oberlin College in Oberlin Ohio. In 1976, Talley also received a Bachelor of Music (B.M.) in Piano Performance from Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Oberlin, Ohio. For a year following Oberlin, she studied piano performance with Carl Seeman at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg in Freiburg, Germany. She continued her studies with Beatrice Erdeley, from the New England Conservatory of Music. After moving to San Diego, she studied for a few years with Pam Madsen and Karen Follingstad (SDSU).\n\nIn 1982, Talley completed a Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from the Joint Program in Oceanography from MIT and WHOI. After a postdoctoral research position at Oregon State University, she joined the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1984.\n\nTalley has worked at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD since 1984, and has been a Distinguished Professor since 2012. While at Scripps, her research has combined analysis of ocean observations with advanced theoretical work to describe and map large-scale circulation. Talley’s research focuses on the general circulation of the ocean and the role of various oceanic and atmospheric conditions that affect ocean currents and property distributions, including salinity. Her work involves analysis of data from most of the world’s oceans, depicting the movement of heat, salinity, and water masses, and the formation of water masses, particularly in subpolar regions.\n\nFrom 2004-2007 she was a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) Working Group and a lead author of the Fourth Assessment Report Working Group I chapter of the group's final report titled: \"Observations: Oceanic Climate Change and Sea Level\", which was released in February 2007. The report earned contributing scientists a share of the Nobel Peace Prize later that year. She was also a lead author on the same topic for the Fifth Assessment Report.\n\nIn addition to numerous academic publications, she has published a widely used graduate level textbook on descriptive physical oceanography, and two oceanographic atlases. Her research and international/national committee work include a focus on ocean climate variability/change. She has played a leadership role in scientific planning and execution of international programs, including the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) of the 1990s and the CLIVAR/CO2 Repeat Hydrography Program of the 2000s to present.\n\nIn 2000, Talley and co-principal investigator, Daniel Rudnick, worked with moorings and hydrography on the collaborative \"Okhotsk Sea dense water formation project.\" In 2005-2006, Talley spent time in the field using hydrography, CTD, and profiling floats to understand Antarctic Intermediate Water formation in the southeast Pacific. Overlapping this time period, between 2005 and 2007, Talley also participated as part of the CLIMODE team on the \"CLIVAR Mode Water Dynamics Experiment (CLIMODE).\"\n\nIn 2009, Talley spent time on sabbatical at \"Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as a Visiting Scientist.\" The following year she took sabbatical at the \"Universite de Grenoble Joseph Fourier\" for sciences, health, technologies.\n\nTalley has a long history of seagoing experiences. As a graduate student in 1978 she joined the hydrography cruise through the Southwestern South Pacific aboard the \"R/V Knorr.\" Between 1993 and 1997, Talley returned to the \"R/V Knorr\" serving as chief scientist on three separate WOCE hydrography cruises in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Subpolar North Atlantic. She has additionally sampled the Pacific and Atlantic waters as part of the WOCE Field Program aboard various research vessels including the \"R/V T. Washington\" (1984, co-chief scientist; 1991, chief scientist), \"R/V T. Thompson\" (1985, chief scientist), \"R/V Oceanus\" (1988, co-chief scientist), and \"R/V Melville\" (1989, chief scientist). In 1999, Talley served as chief scientist on the \"R/V Revelle\" sampling hydrography in the Japan/East Sea and then again as co-chief scientist aboard the Khromov in 1999 and 2000. In 2014, she served as chief scientist for the GO-SHIP hydrography, CTC, float deployment cruise in the Southern Pacific aboard the \"R/V N.B. Palmer.\"\n\nSince 2016, Talley has led the observation team of the SOCCOM project: \"Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM)\", which is deploying biogeochemical profiling Argo floats throughout the Southern Ocean south of 30S. Her research group is involved directly in float, hydrographic and satellite data analysis, interfacing with the Southern Ocean State Estimate and data-model comparisons. She also continues to act as co-chair to the steering committee of the ongoing \"U.S. GO-SHIP\", which organizes and carries out the U.S. component of the international GO-SHIP program of deep-sea hydrographic cruises throughout the world's oceans.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48019057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48019057", "title": "The Cambridge Medieval History", "text": "The Cambridge Medieval History\n\nThe Cambridge Medieval History is a history of medieval Europe in eight volumes published by Cambridge University Press and Macmillan between 1911 and 1936. Publication was delayed by the First World War and changes in the editorial team.\n\nThe work was planned by John Bagnell Bury, Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University, along lines developed by his predecessor, Lord Acton, for \"The Cambridge Modern History\". The first editors appointed were Henry Melvill Gwatkin, Mary Bateson, and G.T. Lapsley. James Pounder Whitney replaced Mary Bateson following her death in 1906. When G.T. Lapsley retired due to ill health, his place was not filled so that the editors of the first two volumes were Gwatkin and Whitney.\n\nIn the preface to the first volume, the editors expressed the wish that the work would be an interesting read for the general user as well as \"a summary of ascertained facts, with indications (not discussions) of disputed points\". They claimed, \"there is nothing in the English language resembling the present work\" and wrote, optimistically, that they \"hoped to publish two volumes yearly in regular succession\". In fact, the final volume was not published until 1936.\n\nThe history aimed to encompass the whole of European medieval history so that the editors were obliged to use a wide range of contributors in order to adequately treat the subject. In particular in relation to volume 2 (\"The Rise of the Saracens and the Foundation of the Western Empire\") the editors complained that \"students of history in this country [England] seldom turn their attention to any part of it\" and thus \"very little has ever been written in English, [on subjects] such as the Visigoths in Spain, the organisation of Imperial Italy and Africa, the Saracen invasions of Sicily and Italy, and the early history and expansion of the Slavs\".\n\nVolumes one and two were published in 1911 and 1913, keeping to the expectation of the editors that the work would move through its volumes at a fast pace.\n\nVolume three, however, was delayed until 1922 by the First World War, which made international collaboration more difficult, and after German scholars had been replaced by British ones due to worries about how the volume would be received in Britain. Some went unpaid as they had signed no contract. A collection was organised for the great German Latinist Max Manitius which raised £10 after he wrote that the war had left him in poverty. Contributors to volumes four and six were similarly effected. Writing in the preface to volume II of \"The New Cambridge Medieval History\" in 1995, Rosamond McKitterick commented on the \"unhappy legacy of the old volume III when the principles of scholarship were sullied with political enmities and many scholars excluded as authors because of their nationality\", a fault that she felt was expunged in the new history.\n\nThe editors of volume three were Gwatkin, Whitney, Joseph Robson Tanner, and Charles William Previté-Orton. The volume was criticised in review for duplication in its coverage of events and definitions, and a failure to cross-reference material, but later commentators saw this as the inevitable consequence of the structure of the work as a collection of scholarly essays drawn from a range of international contributors over 25 years, disrupted by war and changes of editor, rather than an organic synthesis prepared by a small group over a short time-frame.\n\nVolumes four to seven (1923-32) were edited by Tanner, Previté-Orton and Zachary Nugent Brooke (1883-1946) after Brooke replaced Whitney on his retirement. After Tanner died in 1931, volume eight (1936) was completed by Previté-Orton and Brooke.\n\nIn 1966 and 1967, a new edition of volume four was published in two parts edited by Joan Hussey that incorporated developments in the field of Byzantine studies in the forty years since the original was published.\n\n\n"}
