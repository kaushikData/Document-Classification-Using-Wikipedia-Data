In particular, the program focuses on three key areas: The global economy and growth agenda, international financial architecture, and financing for development. The global economy and growth agenda emphasizes structural transformation, trade and technology, and inequality. international financial architecture covers reform and governance of global financial institutions, the global financial safety net and managing capital flows, and financial regulation. financing for development includes taxation and international tax cooperation, infrastructure financing, debt management and sustainability, and financial inclusion.

The organization provides medical, dental and surgical services to needy patients, and impoverished people worldwide, through indirect and direct patient-care programs. The company also provides a social networking application, that allows health volunteers to connect with each other and create new volunteer teams. The organization has matched over 290,000 volunteers to nearly 3,300 organizations worldwide. In total 1.5 million+ patients have received health care as a result of its indirect and direct patient care programs.\n\nIn 2005, during his first year at UCLA Dental School, Patel decided to travel to Brazil to provide dental services to underserved communities. But he encountered difficulties in finding volunteer opportunities, having contacted more than 15 Brazilian organizations and receiving no response. He found that other dental and medical students had experienced similar problems. To address this problem, Patel created the Dental Volunteer and later HealthCare Volunteer to help connect students with volunteer opportunities. During Dental school, Neilesh Patel said he spent many \"pizza nights\" – subsisting on pizza and pulling all-nighters teaching himself how to program and build a Web site, which became the backbone of HealthCare Volunteer. He said he was driven by the belief that all qualified applicants should have the opportunity to volunteer. Soon now-orthopedic surgeon Elliot Mendelosohn, also a biomedical engineering major in his undergraduate days, joined Patel to help build HealthCare Volunteer.\n\nFounded by Neilesh Patel DDS, and Elliot Mendelsohn MD in November, 2005, HealthCare Volunteer has a large listing of health-related volunteering opportunities serving the non-profit sector. Volunteers include physicians, dentists, medical students, and dental assistants, who donate their time to provide services including free surgery and dental care. The organization has direct patient care programs in over 10 countries including India, Ecuador, Kenya, Tanzania, Liberia, Cameroon and Paraguay. In 2007, Patel was selected as a YouthActionNet Fellow in recognition of the organization's efforts, which was awarded at the Embassy of Finland in Washington DC. In 2008, Patel was awarded the UCLA Charles E Young Humanitarian Award for his work in global health. Patel reportedly dropped out of the UCLA MBA Program in 2007 after starting classes his first quarter as the first ever student in the integrated DDS/MBA program in order to focus on HV's growth.\n\nPatel and Mendelsohn have also established HealthCare Tourism International, the first non profit medical tourism accreditation service. Patel started his first non-profit StudentsHelp.org (www.studentshelp.org) at age 17, which helped provide computer services and technical support to needy people around the world.\n\nIn 2013, Patel received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.\n\nOne of the unique features of the HealthCare Volunteer website is its ability to allow volunteers to create online profiles and connect with other volunteers. Once volunteers have signed up and created their profiles, they can form volunteering teams for service at home or abroad.\n\nHealthCare Volunteer has sought to reduce the financial burdens for both volunteers and organizations. First, volunteers pay no money to search HealthCare Volunteer for volunteering opportunities nor must organizations pay any money to post their volunteering opportunities on HealthCare Volunteer. Secondly, HealthCare Volunteer strives to exclusively partner with organizations that do not charge their volunteers additional money beyond accommodation and other essential services in order to volunteer. HealthCare Volunteer believes that volunteers are already volunteering their time and effort and should not be required to pay additional fees above the basic costs (travel, accommodation, and basic services).\n\nIn 2007, HealthCare Volunteer began awarding volunteers who helped advance the mission of HealthCare Volunteer.\n\n2007 Awards:\n\n2008 Awards:\n\n\n\n"}

Since 1994 professor Borys Aleksandrov is the head of the institute.\n\nThe Odessa branch of the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas was reorganized into the Institute of Marine Biology by the resolution #161 of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, dated July 2, 2014. The resolution started to be valued from August 2, 2014.\n\nThe main scientific direction of the institute is the complex study of the different approaches of biology and ecology of marine ecosystems. Among them:\nThe institute elaborates the modern methods of the sampling and processing of the hydrobiological samples, new methods of the analyzing of the scientific information. The institute provides the scientific expertise, \nimproves the methods of protection and management of ecosystems and its sustainable development.

{"id": "2035607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2035607", "title": "Tabubil", "text": "Tabubil\n\nTabubil is a planned, company operated township located in the Star Mountains area of the North Fly District of Western Province, Papua New Guinea. The town, including the adjoining relocated village of Wangabin and the industrial area of Laydown (where industrial equipment was originally laid down before being installed at the mine ~1970–1980), is the largest settlement in the province, although the provincial capital, Daru is a similar size. It had a recorded population of 10,270 at the 2011 census.\n\nTabubil is set in extremely dense jungle fed by one of the highest rainfalls in the world. The town is the largest settlement in the country that has never been a provincial capital, or incorporated within one. The town was established primarily to serve the mine of Ok Tedi, which is currently mining copper and gold.\n\nTabubil lies in the heart of the Min Nation, an area with a distinct ethnic makeup that straddles the Indonesian border, and extends towards the southern Sepik areas and throughout the northern Fly River system. During the early years of colonisation of New Guinea it was unknown how many people, if any, lived in this remote and seemingly impassable and inhospitable terrain.\n\nBefore the 1940s, outside contact with the Min people was either brief, or merely vicarious. It is thought the Min were pushed north hundreds or even thousands of years ago by war with the southern Gogodala peoples, who were a strong warrior nation that currently reside on the plains of the central Fly area of the Western Province.\n\nIt was not until 1943 that USAAF gliders landed deep in the Star Mountains to establish an airstrip station in what is now Telefomin, about 25 km north-east of Tabubil. This is the first permanent colonial influence on the Min people, who at the time were Cannibals involved in a deep tribal war. Soon after the arrival of the Americans, the Telefolmin tribe experienced a cessation of hostilities with its neighbours, the Falamin and the Tifalmin due to mutually agreeable conditions that emerged from the construction and introduction of western goods and services. Conflict between social groups was also forcefully deterred by Australian colonial administrators. After colonial pacification, trade flourished in the area.\n\nTabubil, originally a small camp surrounding an airstrip, was set up as a base of operations for drilling sites by the Kennecott Copper Corporation. In 1976, Australian mining company BHP entered into negotiations with the Papua New Guinea government in an attempt to gain control of the camp and establish it as a gold mining town. BHP was successful in 1980, and in 1981, Ok Tedi Mining Limited was established to take control of operations, with a major BHP shareholding.\n\nToday, the old Kennecott camp is still standing. Known locally as the \"A\" houses, they are ATCO shipping crate styled houses. Later, the \"B\" and \"C\" houses were built by BHP for their workers. BHP has built the majority of the town, with structures placed by other companies and the national government making up only a small percentage of the total buildings. \n\nTabubil is host to a diverse range of cultures, due to its workforce historically being sourced from many parts of PNG, Australia, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Most expatriates are Australian, but there are also many Filipinos. A Canadian mining company, Inmet Mining Corporation owns an 18% stake in the mine, and of Tabubil.  A number of Canadians, particularly those from Port Hardy on Vancouver Island, have also resided in Tabubil. During recent years, however, Ok Tedi Mining Limited has looked closer to home for human resources, with its long existent, but recently enforced \"preferred area\" human resourcing plan.\n\nThe main cultural event of the year is Papua New Guinea's Independence Day. The event is proceeded by a festival known as the \"Amamas Week\" meaning joyful week, encompassing a week of traditional and contemporary dancing(arranged and performed by school students, local groups and groups from other provinces), music, traditional ceremonies. In the 90s, performers from other countries like Samoa, New Zealand, were also invited to showcase their traditional dances for that joyful week. \n\nAn election is extremely important to local residents, often inciting riots, tribal conflict, and other forms of civil disobedience. The provincial government has banned the sale of alcohol during an election to try and curb violence. \n\nMelbourne Cup day has been a well celebrated event since the foundation of the town. As many expatriate residents of the town are from Australia, Melbourne Cup celebrations have been a traditionally important connection to the culture left behind in Australia. \n\nThe most popular religion in the town is Christianity. There are still a few people that hold traditional beliefs, and others that blend traditional beliefs with Christianity.\n\nTabubil is host to four major permanent churches, and many other church groups that meet in the large undercover areas beneath the \"B\" and \"C\" style houses.\n\nThe Mission Aviation Fellowship has a presence in Tabubil Airport and the YMCA and YWCA hold a strong influence over the town culture and commerce.\n\nAlthough many people in Tabubil own computers, Internet use is very rare. There is, however, a wide selection of cable TV stations available from Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, PNG, and the USA. There is a local TV station called OTV. Several AM and FM radio stations are available in town. Radio Fly on Shortwave 3915 kHz and 5960 kHz.\n\nMobile (Cellular) phone and data services are provided by Telikom PNG (CitiFon) and Digicel.\n\nTabubil has a tropical rainforest climate. The town is known unofficially as one of the wettest places on earth, with an average annual rainfall of 8 metres per annum, and a peak rainfall of 10 metres per annum. The unique weather conditions have caused much adaptation in the local jungle flora and fauna, causing Tabubil to be particularly interesting to the scientific community.\n\nTabubil often has a transient population that aren't used to the large amounts of rain that fall there. Locals, however, operate quite happily in the rain, as it rains daily, and residents cannot afford to let it disrupt their lives.\n\nMost fixed houses in northern Tabubil are designed to suit the town and its unique conditions much better than their counterparts in the south, as the 'B' and 'C' class houses are newer. Most of these newer houses have a large dry undercover area under the house, and are raised on stilts. Many people think the houses are on stilts due to the possibility of flooding, but they mostly provide protection from the many earthquakes in the area.\n\nThe entire town is slightly sloped on an increment towards the south. This provides excellent water runoff, which is aided by the many 'floodways' which are found around town, and allow large volumes of water to cross roads. Most residents, especially on the escarpment side of town, have large ravines in their backyards which can fill up to a depth of two metres during especially wet periods, and pose a safety hazard.\n\nBecause of the large rainfall, there are many indoor sporting facilities in town. Indoor facilities for sports such as squash, indoor cricket, gymnastics, basketball, and other sports are available.\n\nIn a country where biodiversity is extreme, the area around Tabubil is regarded as being especially unique. There are untold numbers of different species of birds, fish, insects, spiders, and small animals.  The area around Tabubil is known for moths that grow to the size of dinner plates, bird eating spiders and many other unique creatures.  New species are being discovered constantly.\n\nThe sheer abundance of life in the area is attributed to the high rainfall. In town, many plant species, such as mint, that grow elsewhere in the world can be found in large amounts. The plants in Tabubil are larger than usual, and grow much faster than they do elsewhere.\n\nTabubil is the base of operations for the Ok Tedi Copper Mine, the largest economic entity in the Western Province.  The mine accounts for over half of the entire province's economy and 25.7% of the country's entire export earnings.  Consequently, Tabubil is the richest and most well served settlement in western Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe mine, which operates as Ok Tedi Mining Limited was formerly owned by a joint initiative between the PNG government, and Australian mining giant, BHP.  In 2002 the mine was restructured, and the PNG Sustainable Development Program now owns the BHP share.\n\nTabubil is serviced by a hotel, a hospital, a police station and courthouse, fire station, two primary schools (one international), a community high school, two supermarkets, a bakery, chemist, two banks, and a hardware store. Various other local businesses create an unusually Westernised culture within this remote town.\n\nVarious clubs operate in the town, including the Golf Club, the Hash House Harriers, and the Gazebo club. For non drinking related recreation there is an indoor squash court, indoor cricket centre, tennis courts, a public pool, rugby fields, a gym, and many jungle tracks which may or may not be safe to walk along.\n\nThe main commercial hub of town is in the Centre, to the northeast of the airport. This commercial district is based around a town square plan, and was host to the first ATMs, EFTPOS machines and public telephones in western Papua New Guinea. The largest store in town, the Tabubil Superstore, is located in the Centre. There is also a smaller, newer supermarket in the north of town and several smaller convenience shops known as \"Lik-Lik Shops\" after the Tok Pisin word for \"small\".\n\nTabubil is powered by a hydro-electric station at Ok Menga, capable of producing 10 megawatts of electricity, and has a backup diesel power generating plant.\n\nThe main industrial hub is at the south end of the airport. This area was originally known locally as the 'Lay-Down' area, due to the fact that it was the storage location for much of the materials shipped in for the construction of the town. It is currently officially known as the ward of Laytown.\n\nA sawmill (now disused) is located at Sawmill Creek.\n\nTabubil itself is situated amongst dense jungle on a plateau, beside a steep escarpment leading down to the Ok Tedi River in the Star Mountains of Papua New Guinea. The township is very remote and is only accessible via air, or river barge followed by road.\n\nTabubil has an international airport (IATA code TBG) with a 1280-metre (4200 ft) dirt and gravel airstrip. Most passenger traffic is handled by daily flights to Port Moresby or Mount Hagen and tri-weekly flights to Cairns in Australia by Asia Pacific Airlines Dash 8s. Prior to the introduction of Dash 8 services, a King Air Super 200 was used for mine traffic.\n\nAsia Pacific Airlines is a local company with head offices in Tabubil, and a good safety record, additionally Airlines PNG, Mission Aviation Fellowship and Air Niugini also fly to Tabubil Regularly. Tabubil was also regularly serviced by Talair before it was disbanded.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Tabubil was a small camp. Before construction of the town, Tabubil's first airstrip was in a different location, and a different angle to the airstrip that exists today. Air travel was instrumental in the development of the town, as there were no roads and the Kiunga-Tabubil Highway, which was a major logistical problem, was not constructed yet.\n\nThere are some sealed main streets in Tabubil, and several unsealed minor roads. The central north-south road in the town, separating the 'B' and 'C' houses is called \"Spine Road\", and is closed to vehicular traffic by large boulders at the end of each local road, apart from a small section at the south that is used for access to a group of townhouses. This non-vehicular road creates a well used and safe walkway through the town. Market stalls are common on this road, and there are two \"lik-lik\" stores adjacent to the road, and the town's only public park and playground.\n\nAll major roads are sealed and contain numerous \"floodways\" which allow the large amounts of rain in the town to wash over the road without obstructing traffic.\n\nThe most common form of roadkill in town is snakes, which will often stretch across the road seeking heat from the bitumen.\n\nThe township is situated upon an unsealed highway.  One end of the highway terminates at Ok Tedi mine, about 30 km by road to the northwest.  The other end of the highway terminates at the river port of Kiunga, the most northern navigable point of the Fly River, about 100 km to the south. Buses, private vehicles, and heavy trucking operations run along this route. This highway is used for transportation of supplies to the town and to the mine from barges on the Fly River.  The highway is heavily used by trucking operations heading to and from the port. Slurry of copper concentrate from the mine is sent to the river port along a 137 km pipeline which runs parallel to this highway. The Kiunga-Tabubil Highway is one of the only all-weather roads in the province, and most other roads in the district feed into this remote highway.\n\nExcept in cases of severe drought, most supplies to the mine are delivered by barge along the Fly River, which can be accessed by a port in Kiunga on the southern terminus of the Kiunga-Tabubil Highway. All the produce from the mine and all local exports are sent from this port. The Fly river has a water level which is often too low for shipping, and barges are often banked mid-passage. River barge followed by truck is the only way to supply the township apart from air cargo.\n\nIt is not uncommon for residents to access other remote areas by foot.  Most locals can tell you how many days it would take to walk to most locations within the country.  Walking often is the only way for people to get to their local villages anyway, as many local airstrips are in disrepair.  The maintenance of airstrips is a Local Level Government responsibility, and many LLGs in the surrounding area are severely underfunded.\n\n"}

Multiple leaks of proposed TTIP contents into the public caused controversy.\n\nThe European Commission says that the TTIP would boost the EU's economy by €120 billion, the US economy by €90 billion and the rest of the world by €100 billion. According to Anu Bradford, law professor at Columbia Law School, and Thomas J. Bollyky of the Council on Foreign Relations, TTIP aims to \"liberalise one-third of global trade\" and could create millions of new jobs. A \"Guardian\" article by Dean Baker of the US thinktank Center for Economic and Policy Research argued that the economic benefits per household would be relatively small. According to a European Parliament report, impacts on labour conditions range from job gains to job losses, depending on economic model and assumptions used for predictions.\n\nThe agreement has been criticized and opposed by some unions, charities, NGOs and environmentalists, particularly in Europe. \"The Independent\" describes common criticisms of TTIP as \"reducing the regulatory barriers to trade for big business, things like food safety law, environmental legislation, banking regulations and the sovereign powers of individual nations\", or more critically as an \"assault on European and US societies by transnational corporations\". \"The Guardian\" noted the criticism of TTIP's \"undemocratic nature of the closed-door talks\", \"influence of powerful lobbyists\", TTIP's potential ability to \"undermine the democratic authority of local government\", and described it as \"the most controversial trade deal the EU has ever negotiated\". German economist Max Otte argued that by putting European workers into direct competition with Americans (and in effect because of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexicans), TTIP would negatively impact the European social models. An EU direct democracy mechanism, the European Citizens' Initiative, which enables EU citizens to call directly on the European Commission to propose a legal act, acquired over 3.2 million signatures against TTIP and CETA within a year.\n\nEconomic barriers between the EU and the United States are relatively low, not only due to long-standing membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) but also recent agreements such as the EU–US Open Skies Agreement and work by the Transatlantic Economic Council. The European Commission claims that passage of a trans-Atlantic trade pact could boost overall trade between the respective blocs by as much as 50%. Economic gains from a Trade Treaty were predicted in the joint report issued by the White House and the European Commission.\n\nSome form of Transatlantic Free Trade Area had been proposed in the 1990s and later in 2006 by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in reaction to the collapse of the Doha world trade talks. However, protectionism on both sides may be a barrier to any future agreement. It was first initiated in 1990, when, shortly after the end of the Cold War, with the world no longer divided into two blocs, the European Community (12 countries) and the US signed a \"Transatlantic Declaration\". This called for the continued existence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as well as for yearly summits, biannual meetings between ministers of State, and more frequent encounters between political figures and senior officials.\n\nSubsequent initiatives taken by the European deciders and the US government included: in 1995, the creation of a pressure group of business people, the Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) by public authorities on both sides of the Atlantic; in 1998, the creation of an advisory committee, the Transatlantic Economic Partnership; in 2007, the creation of the Transatlantic Economic Council, in which representatives from firms operating on both sides of the Atlantic meet to advise the European Commission and the US government – and finally, in 2011, the creation of a group of high-level experts whose conclusions, submitted on 11 February 2013, recommended the launching of negotiations for a wide-ranging free-trade agreement. On 12 February 2013, President Barack Obama called in his annual State of the Union address for such an agreement. The following day, EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso announced that talks would take place to negotiate the agreement.\n\nThe United States and European Union together represent 60% of global GDP, 33% of world trade in goods and 42% of world trade in services. There are a number of trade conflicts between the two powers, but both depend on the other's economic market and disputes only affect 2% of total trade. A free trade area between the two would represent potentially the largest regional free-trade agreement in history, covering 46% of world GDP.\n\nThe United States investment in the European Union is three times greater than US investment in the entire continent of Asia and EU investment in the United States is eight times that of European Union investment in India and China combined. Intra-company transfers are estimated to constitute a third of all transatlantic trade. The United States and European Union are the largest trading partners of most other countries in the world and account for a third of world trade flows. Given the already low tariff barriers (under 3%), to make the deal a success the aim is to remove non-tariff barriers.\n\nDocuments released by the European Commission in July 2014 group the topics under discussion into three broad areas: Market access; Specific regulation; and broader rules and principles and modes of co-operation.\n\nThe EU negotiating mandate as of June 2013 gave a fuller view of what the Council of the European Union (Foreign Affairs) has told its negotiators to try to achieve for each section. No corresponding US text is available, but the American side has released a public statement setting out its objectives and the potential benefits it foresees.\n\nThe secret contents of the first concrete American proposal on tariff reduction, and an EU counterproposal, which was leaked to Correctiv in February 2016, suggest 87.5% to 97% of all tariffs would be cut to zero.\n\nTTIP includes chapters on market access for goods and services that aim to remove \"custom duties on goods and restrictions on services, gaining better access to public markets, and making it easier to invest\". The goods part includes rules on market access for goods, agriculture and processed agricultural products, and rules of origin.\n\nFor \"Trade in Services, Investment and E-commerce\", a draft text dated 7 July 2013 was leaked by the German newspaper, \"Die Zeit\" in March 2014. The leaked text contains seven chapters. In Chapter 1, Article 1 states the overall objective of \"a better climate for the development of trade and investment\", particularly the \"liberalisation of investment and cooperation on e-commerce\".\n\nChapter II, Article 3 to Article 18 contains general principles for investment. Article 14 contains proposed rules that forbid governments to \"directly or indirectly nationalise, expropriate\" unless it is for a public purpose, under due process of law, on a non-discriminatory basis, with compensation. Article 14(2) defines the necessary compensation as being \"fair market value of the investment at the time immediately before the expropriation or the impending expropriation became public knowledge plus interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis\".\n\nChapter III, Articles 19 to 23 contains rules on cross border supply of services.\n\nChapter IV, Articles 24 to 28 would allow free movement of business managers, and other employees of a corporation, for temporary work purposes among all countries party to the agreement. Article 1(2) makes it clear, however, that no more general free movement of workers and citizens is allowed.\n\nChapter V contains eight sections with particular rules for different economic sectors. Section I, articles 29 to 31, set out principles that states must follow in licensing private corporations, and state that requirements that are not proportionate to a reviewable public policy objective are contrary to the treaty. Section II contains general provisions. Section III covers computer services. Section IV, articles 35 to 39, cover liberalisation of postal services. Section V, articles 40 to 50, apply to electronic communications networks and services (including telecommunications) and mandate competitive markets, absence of cross-subsidies, subject to defined exceptions including in article 46 a right (but not a requirement) for countries to provide universal service.\n\nSection VI of chapter V covers Financial Services, in articles 51 to 59. It limits the laws that governments can pass to regulate or publicly run insurance and banking. Any regulations that do not fall within the Treaty's terms and objectives would be unlawful. Legitimate reasons for regulation include, in article 52, \"the protection of investors, depositors, policy-holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial service supplier; (b) ensuring the integrity and stability of a Party's financial system\". However article 52(2) states \"measures shall not be more burdensome than necessary to achieve their aim\", and the Treaty does not include any further reasons to allow regulation. Section VII covers international maritime transport and section VIII covers air transport.\n\nThe Annex on \"Investors-state dispute settlement\" proposed to allow corporations to bring actions against governments for breach of its rights. The European Commission launched a public consultation after the draft text was leaked, which led to a number of changes. However, an updated proposed text had yet to be made publicly available. In September 2015, the Commission proposed an \"Investment Court System\" to replace the ISDS clauses, with the scope for investor challenge much reduced and with \"highly skilled judges\" rather than arbitrators used to determine cases.\n\n\"Improved regulatory coherence and cooperation by dismantling unnecessary regulatory barriers such as bureaucratic duplication of effort\".\n\nSpecific heads for discussion include:\n\n\"Improved cooperation when it comes to setting international standards\".\n\nSpecific heads for discussion include:\n\n\nThe TTIP Agreement texts are being developed by 24 joint EU-US working groups, each considering a separate aspect of the agreement. Development typically progresses through a number of phases. Broad \"position paper\"s are first exchanged, introducing each side's aims and ambitions for each aspect. These are followed by \"textual proposals\" from each side, accompanied (in areas such as tariffs, and market access) by each side's \"initial offer.\" These negotiations and draft documents can evolve (change) through the various stages of their development. When both sides are ready, a \"consolidated text\" is prepared, with remaining differences for discussion expressed in square brackets. These texts are then provisionally closed topic by topic as a working consensus is reached. However the agreement is negotiated as a whole, so no topic's text is finalised until full consensus is reached.\n\nNegotiations are held in week-long cycles alternating between Brussels and the USA. The negotiators were hoping to conclude their work by the end of 2016.\n\n\nOnly a few people can access the documents known as \"consolidated texts\", the drafts containing the most recent results of the negotiations. On the European side, authorised readers include the European Commission negotiators (most of them from the Directorate-General for Trade), MEPs and European Union members' MPs. Upon the insistence of the US, the documents are not transmitted any more as electronic or even printed documents. \nThey are only available in secure rooms at the European Commission HQ in Brussels, in a number of US embassies, and at the offices of member states' trade ministries. In all these secured rooms phones or other types of scanning device are forbidden. Blank sheets of paper, marked with the reader's names, are provided on which visitors can jot down their notes. \nOn the US side, the procedure is similar: only Senators and USTR negotiators may access the documents and must comply with similar conditions. The US side has insisted on the same security arrangements for the drafts of the Trans-Pacific Partnership proposal.\n\nThe negotiations were planned to be finalized by the end of 2014, but according to economist Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, at least another four or five years of negotiations remained at the end of that year. In November 2014 the Bulgarian government announced that it will not ratify the agreement unless the United States lifted visa requirements for Bulgarian citizens.\n\nGerman Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that free trade talks between the European Union and the United States have failed, citing a lack of progress on any of the major sections of the long-running negotiations. \"In my opinion the negotiations with the United States have de facto failed, even though nobody is really admitting it\" the German broadcaster Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen quoted the minister, according to a written transcript of an interview aired on 28 August 2016. \"[They] have failed because we Europeans did not want to subject ourselves to American demands.\"\n\nNegotiation progress as of 27 April 2016:\nThe twenty-eight European Union-member governments will have to approve of the partnership, via unanimous voting under TFEU Articles 207 and 218, on the negotiated agreement in the Council of the European Union, at which point the European Parliament will also be asked for its endorsement. The European Parliament is empowered to approve or reject the agreement. In case the Council of the European Union, following a proposal from the European Commission, designates TTIP to be a \"mixed agreement\", approval from all Parliaments of the EU Member States in accordance with individual constitutional procedures is necessary before the agreement can enter into force. In the United States, both houses of the Congress will have to pass the agreement for it to be ratified.\n\nTTIP aims for a formal agreement that would \"liberalize one-third of global trade\" and, proponents argue, will create millions of new paid jobs. \"With tariffs between the United States and the European Union already low, the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research estimates that 80 percent of the potential economic gains from the TTIP agreement depend on reducing the conflicts of duplication between EU and US rules on those and other regulatory issues, ranging from food safety to automobile parts.\" A successful strategy (according to Thomas Bollyky at the Council on Foreign Relations and Anu Bradford of Columbia Law School) will focus on business sectors for which transatlantic trade laws and local regulations can often overlap, e.g., pharmaceutical, agricultural, and financial trading. This will ensure that the United States and Europe remain \"standard makers, rather than standard takers\", in the global economy, subsequently ensuring that producers worldwide continue to gravitate toward joint US-EU standards.\n\nIn March 2013, an economic assessment by the European Centre for Economic Policy Research estimates that such a comprehensive agreement would result in GDP growth of 68–119 billion euros for the European Union by 2027 and GDP growth of 50–95 billion euros (about 53.5–101 billion US dollars) in the United States in the same time frame. The 2013 report also estimates that a limited agreement focused only on tariffs would yield EU GDP growth of 24 billion euros by 2027 and growth of 9 billion euros in the United States. If shared equally among the affected people, the most optimistic GDP growth estimates would translate into \"additional annual disposable income for a family of four\" of \"545 euros in the EU\" and \"655 euros in the US\", respectively.\n\nIn a \"Wall Street Journal\" article, the CEO of Siemens AG (with its workforce located 70% in Europe and 30% in the United States) claimed that the TTIP would strengthen United States and EU global competitiveness by reducing trade barriers, by improving intellectual property protections, and by establishing new international \"rules of the road\".\n\nThe European Commission says that the TTIP would boost the EU's economy by €120 billion, the US economy by €90 billion and the rest of the world by €100 billion. Talks began in July 2013 and reached the third round of negotiations by the end of that year.\n\nAmerican economist Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research observed that with conventional trade barriers between the US and the EU already low, the deal would focus on non-conventional barriers, such as overriding national regulations on fracking, GMOs, and finance, but also tightening laws on copyright. He goes on to assert that, with less ambitious projections, the economic benefits per household are unimpressive: \"If we apply the projected income gain of 0.21% to the projected median personal income in 2027, it comes to a bit more than $50 a year. That's a little less than 15 cents a day. Don't spend it all in one place\".\n\nA 2018 paper by KU Leuven economists estimated that a \"deep\" free-trade agreement, such as TTIP, between the United States and the European Union would increase EU GDP by 1.3% and US GDP by 0.7%. These gains would primarily be the result of reductions in non-tarriff barriers to trade.\n\nThe content of the drafts of agreement, as well as the reports on negotiation rounds, are classified from the public, an arrangement that \"The Independent\" criticised as \"secretive and undemocratic\". As noted above, elected representatives may only view the texts in a secure \"reading room\" in Brussels, to avoid any further leaks of information about TTIP negotiations into the public domain.\n\nTo answer the criticism, the European Commission has made negotiation documents public, including all EU proposals in the regulatory and rules components of the agreement. The Trade Commissioner has described the negotiations as \"the most transparent trade talks ever conducted by the EU\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" described TTIP as \"the most controversial trade deal the EU has ever negotiated\". TTIP negotiations are criticized and opposed by some unions, charities, NGOs and environmentalists, particularly in Europe. \"The Independent\" summarizes the negative impact of TTIP as \"reducing the regulatory barriers to trade for big business, things like food safety law, environmental legislation, banking regulations and the sovereign powers of individual nations\", or more critically as an \"assault on European and US societies by transnational corporations\". German economist Max Otte stated that the proposed (ISDS) court of arbitration and protection of foreign investment would mean a \"complete dis-empowerment of politics\" and that, regarding labour economics, free trade agreements typically enforce lower standards and that TTIP would put European workers into direct competition with Americans (and in effect because of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexicans), which would impact European social models. Otte also concluded: \"We really don't want the social system of these countries [United States and Mexico] here [in Europe].\"\n\nAn October 2014 study by Jeronim Capaldo of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University indicates that there will be losses in terms of net exports, net losses in terms of GDP, loss of labour income, job losses, reduction of the labour share, loss of government revenue and higher financial instability among European countries.\n\nAnti-poverty group Global Justice Now asserts that TTIP would undermine job security as well as current minimum labour standards agreed in the EU. British Labour Party politician John McDonnell, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, has described TTIP as resulting in a huge transfer of powers to Brussels and corporate interests that will bring about a form of \"modern-day serfdom\". According to a European Parliament report, impacts on labour conditions range from job gains to job losses, depending on economic model and assumptions used for predictions.\n\nIn spite of a study by the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research (on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Economics) claiming that up to 400,000 jobs could be created in the EU by TTIP, Stefan Körzell, national board member of the Confederation of German Trade Unions (DGB) has said \"Whether TTIP can create jobs, and 'how many' and 'where' is unclear. Previous studies, ranging from those conducted by the European Commission across to the expertise of the Ifo Institute, fluctuate between optimism and very low expectations... Consideration of the negative consequences trade agreements can have, if environmental or labour standards are ignored, is often omitted. As of August 2015, the US had ratified two (prohibitions of child labour and slavery) of the eight ILO core labour standards.\"\n\nInvestor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) is an instrument that allows an investor to bring a case directly against the country hosting its investment, without the intervention of the government of the investor's country of origin. From the late 1980s, certain trade treaties have included provisions for ISDS that allow foreign investors who claim to have been disadvantaged by actions of a signatory state, to sue that state for damages in a tribunal of arbitration. More recently such claims have increased in number and value, and some states have become increasingly resistant to such clauses.\n\nCritics of TTIP say that \"ISDS provisions undermine the power of national governments to act in the interests of their citizens\", that \"TTIP could even undermine the democratic authority of local government\", and that it threatens democracy. France and Germany have said that they want access to investor-state dispute settlement removed from the TTIP treaty. In December 2013, a coalition of over 200 environmentalists, labor unions and consumer advocacy organizations on both sides of the Atlantic sent a letter to the USTR and European Commission demanding the investor-state dispute settlement be dropped from the trade talks, claiming that ISDS was \"a one-way street by which corporations can challenge government policies, but neither governments nor individuals are granted any comparable rights to hold corporations accountable\". Some point out the \"potential for abuse\" that may be inherent in the trade agreement due to its clauses relating to investor protection.\n\nIn December 2013, Martti Koskenniemi, Professor of International Law at the University of Helsinki, warned that the planned foreign investor protection scheme within the treaty, similar to World Bank Group's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), would endanger the sovereignty of the signatory states by allowing for a small circle of legal experts sitting in a foreign court of arbitration an unprecedented power to interpret and void the signatory states' legislation.\n\nFaced with such broad and vociferous criticism, ISDS was abandoned in September 2015; in its place, the European Commission proposed an Investment Court System (ICS). Not long afterwards, ICS was declared illegal by the German Association of Magistrates, though the commission dismissed the magistrates' judgement as based on a misunderstanding. For its part, the United States wants ISDS reinstated.\n\nIn February 2016, Labour (UK) leader Jeremy Corbyn said that human rights should be part of TTIP, \ndescribing TTIP as a threat to national sovereignty, workers, consumers, health and the environment.\n\nAccording to a \"The Guardian\" report, TTIP draft leaked in 2016 shows \"irreconcilable\" differences between EU and the US in some areas, with the US demanding that EU compromise its \"environmental, consumer protection and public health standards\".\n\nBritish unions such as Unite and the TUC have opposed TTIP on the grounds that it would undermine the National Health Service and allows for the further privatisation of public services. A Unite spokesperson described TTIP as \"about deregulation and a race to the bottom on standards. Unison has fought and won on bringing services back into the public sector. ... We cannot allow TTIP to threaten those successes.\"\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary David Owen said that TTIP would have a significant negative impact on the UK's National Health Service because the Service would be subject to increased competition under the TTIP regime.<ref name=\"Telegraph 6/4/16\">NHS would be 'completely unrecognisable' within years if UK remains inside the EU K. McCann, The Daily Telegraph, 6 April 2016</ref>\n\nFormer UK prime minister David Cameron said that critics of free-trade should not use the National Health Service (NHS) to take people's attention away, and honestly speak about trade deals. UK's Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said that TTIP provided adequate protection for UK's NHS.\n\nAssistant General Secretary of Unite Gail Cartmail said that TTIP was a real and serious threat to the NHS, adding that the threat would not be neutralised unless David Cameron gave a cast-iron guarantee that he would exclude the NHS from TTIP.\n\nDocuments released in May 2015 showed that US negotiators had pressured the EU over proposed pesticide criteria. A number of pesticides containing endocrine disrupting chemicals were forbidden in draft EU criteria. On 2 May 2013, US negotiators insisted the EU drop the criteria. They stated that a risk-based approach should be taken on regulation. Later the same day Catherine Day (Secretary-General of the European Commission) wrote to Karl Falkenberg (Director General for the Environment) asking for these criteria to be removed. , 82 pesticides used in the US were banned in Europe and US animal welfare standards are generally lower than those in Europe.\n\nA columnist in \"The Guardian\" stated that food safety in the EU might be compromised because of low or different standards in US food regulations, if currently EU-banned food were allowed to be imported. In June 2015, the BBC reported that food safety had become 'a stumbling block' because of differing US and EU attitudes to genetically modified crops, pesticides (endocrine disrupting chemicals), growth promoting hormones in beef and pathogen reduction treatments of chicken, that cause public health concerns for consumers and put European farmers at a cost disadvantage. Ban on animal testing in the EU has been described by \"The Guardian\" as \"irreconcilable\" with the US approach.\n\nA draft of the sustainable development section of TTIP was leaked to \"The Guardian\" in October 2015. Asked to comment on the document, a French environmental attorney described the proposed environmental safeguards as \"virtually non-existent\" by comparison with the protection granted to investors, and that environmental cases accounted for 60% of the 127 ISDS cases already brought against EU countries under bilateral trade agreements in the last two decades, according to Friends of the Earth Europe.\nAccording to Joseph E. Stiglitz, TTIP could have a \"chilling\" effect on regulation and thus \"undercut urgently needed action on climate that the Paris agreement requires\". He says that industries that do not pay for the \"social costs\" of pollution in effect receive hidden subsidies, and that TTIP would give companies many more opportunities to sue governments over environmental protection mechanisms.\n\nThe draft energy chapter of the TTIP was leaked to \"The Guardian\" in July 2016. According to \"The Guardian\", this draft could \"sabotage\" European efforts to implement mandatory energy savings measures and to favor the switch to renewable electricity generation. The draft text obliges the two trade blocs to: \"foster industry self-regulation of energy efficiency requirements for goods where such self-regulation is likely to deliver the policy objectives faster or in a less costly manner than mandatory requirements\". The draft also mandates that operators of energy networks grant access to gas and electricity \"on commercial terms that are reasonable, transparent and non-discriminatory, including as between types of energy\". This would open feed-in tariff schemes to commercial challenge, including that used by Germany. The Green MEP Claude Turmes stated: \"These proposals are completely unacceptable. They would sabotage EU legislators' ability to privilege renewables and energy efficiency over unsustainable fossil fuels. This is an attempt to undermine democracy in Europe.\"\n\nThe EU's draft text for the trade and sustainable development chapter was also leaked to \"The Guardian\" in July 2016. The draft, dated 23 June 2016 and marked \"restricted\", reveals new loopholes on a G20 pledge to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. The IMF estimates these subsidies run globally at $10million per minute and G7 ministers pledged to remove them in May 2016 in a meeting in Japan. The draft however states that \"such a phasing out may take into account security of supply considerations\". \"The Guardian\" believes that this passage could be open to abuse and used to slow the phase out of subsidies.\n\nAccording to critics, TTIP could weaken the stricter bank regulations that are governing banks in the United States as part of the financial reforms that followed the financial crisis of 2007–08.\n\nCritics of TTIP argue that its proposals on intellectual property could have a similar effect as the EU-rejected Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The Electronic Frontier Foundation and its German counterpart, FFII, in particular, compared TTIP to the ACTA.\n\nIn March 2013, a coalition of digital rights organisations and other groups issued a declaration in which they called on the negotiating partners to have TTIP \"debated in the US Congress, the European Parliament, national parliaments, and other transparent forums\" instead of conducting \"closed negotiations that give privileged access to corporate insiders\", and to leave intellectual property out of the agreement.\n\nIn 2014, an online consultation conducted by the European Commission received 150,000 responses. According to the commission, 97% of the responses were pre-defined, negative answers provided by activists. Additionally, hundreds of demonstrations and protests have taken place in an organised \"day of action\" on 11 October 2014, and again on 18 April 2015. In February 2016, Greenpeace activists blocked secret talks on the Investment Court System.\n\nA self-organised European Citizens' Initiative against TTIP and CETA has also been established, acquiring over 3.2 million signatures within a year.\n\nIn April 2016, Barack Obama visited UK, and more than 130,000 people signed a petition organised by political activism group 38 Degrees, urging Obama to stop negotiating TTIP. The group planned to send an open letter to Obama to urge Obama to oppose the pact, saying that TTIP would be a threat to NHS, food standards, animal welfare and democracy because it 'gives corporations more power than people'.\n\nIn 2016, Greenpeace published 248 pages of classified documents from the TTIP trade negotiations. Greenpeace Netherlands said it released the documents \"to provide much needed transparency and trigger an informed debate on the treaty\".\n\nFrom both the European and American sides of the agreement, there are issues which are seen as essential if an accord is to be reached. According to Leif Johan Eliasson of Saarland University, \"For the EU these include greater access to the American public procurement market, retained bans on imports of genetically modified organisms (GMO) crops and hormone treated beef, and recognition of geographic trademarks on food products. For the United States they include greater access for American dairy and other agricultural products (including scientific studies as the only accepted criteria for SPS policies).\" He observes that measures like the EU ban on hormone treated beef (based as they are on the precautionary principle) are not considered by the WTO to be based on scientific studies.\n\nEliasson further states that US objectives in a deal include \"tariff-free motor vehicle exports,\" and retained bans on foreign contractors in several areas,\" including domestic shipping (see Merchant Marine Act of 1920). Already, some American producers are concerned by EU proposals to restrict use of \"particular designations\" (also known as PDO or GI/geographical indications) that the EU considers location-specific, such as feta and Parmesan cheeses and possibly Budweiser beer. This has provoked debate between European politicians such as Renate Künast and Christian Schmidt over the value of the designations.\n\nAt French insistence, trade in audio-visual services was excluded from the EU negotiating mandate. The European side has been pressing for the agreement to include a chapter on the regulation of financial services; but this is being resisted by the American side, which has recently passed the Dodd–Frank Act in this field. US Ambassador to the European Union Anthony L. Gardner has denied any linkage between the two issues.\n\nEuropean negotiators are also pressing the United States to loosen its restrictions on the export of crude oil and natural gas, to help the EU reduce its dependence on energy from Russia.\n\nKarel De Gucht responded to criticism in a \"Guardian\" article in December 2013, saying \"The commission has regularly consulted a broad range of civil society organisations in writing and in person, and our most recent meeting had 350 participants from trade unions, NGOs and business\" and that \"no agreement will become law before it is thoroughly examined and signed off by the European parliament and 29 democratically elected national governments – the US government and 28 in the EU's council\" However, the Corporate Europe Observatory (cited in the original \"Guardian\" article) had pointed out, based on a Freedom of Information request, that \"more than 93% of the Commission's meetings with stakeholders during the preparations of the negotiations were with big business\". They characterized the industry meetings as \"about the EU's preparations of the trade talks\", and the civil society consultation as \"an information session after the talks were launched\".\n\nLooking beyond TTIP, a wider \"transatlantic free trade area\" has been postulated. This might include, on the American side, the other members of North American Free Trade Area (Canada and Mexico); and on the European side, the members of the European Free Trade Association (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein). Mexico already has a free trade agreement with EFTA and the EU while Canada has one with EFTA and has negotiated one with the EU. These agreements may need to be harmonized with the EU-US agreement and could potentially form a wider free trade area.\n\nIn early 2013, Canadian media observers had speculated that the launch of TTIP talks put pressure on Canada to secure ratification of its own three-year-long FTA negotiations with the EU by the close of 2013. Countries with customs agreements with the EU, like Turkey's, could face the prospect of opening their markets to American goods, without access for their own goods without a separate agreement with the United States.\n\nVarious groups have produced reports about the proposed agreement, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
