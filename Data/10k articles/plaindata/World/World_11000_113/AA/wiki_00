In addition to lectures, competitions, and workshops, there are exhibits, concerts, films and theater plays.\nThe festival occurs once a year in Belgrade at the end of May or the beginning of June, and usually lasts about 4 to 7 days. The first show was held at the \"Žitomlina\" silo in the Dorćol area of Belgrade. Since then, the festival regularly took place in the once derelict industrial zone of Savamala, helping revitalize the Belgrade neighborhood, before returning to Dorćol in 2017. \n\nIn 2010, the festival attracted 40,000 visitors and in 2017, the numbers had risen to 75,000. \n\nThe Misker Festival is part of the Mikser umbrella organization, which includes the Mikser House, a gallery and cultural space located in the Savamala neighborhood.

Winners had their work shown at design events such as the Milan Furniture Fair and Vienna Design Week.\n\nIn 2014, the Misker Festival focused on the Savamala neighbourhood, in a bid to continue its revitalization. 40 urban planners from around the world were invited to discuss possibilities for renewal. Austrian choreographer William Dorner performed a dance recital with the goal of inspiring local residents to protect their city. Three Swiss artists exhibited a multimedia installation featuring video footage of Savamala and other urban neighborhoods. A conference and workshops were also held with Dutch designer Renne Ramakers and British architect Jeremy Till in attendance.\n\nThe 2017 festival concentrated on the themes of migration, education on the move, the city, and the making of culture. The topics were addressed through design, the visual arts, cinema and music, as well as the lecture series \"Mikser Talks\". About 50 local and international experts spoke about the planning of cities, architecture, design, social sciences, information technologies, and communications.

It is a Christian faith that views Jesus Christ as its founder and head, and the Bible (especially the New Testament) as its written authority. Evangelical Protestants in Albania numbered approximately 8,000 in 1998. The International Religious Freedom Report of 2007 reported 189 different Protestant associations and groups. Unlike other official religions in Albania, Evangelical Protestants are not organized under a hierarchy with an official head, but operate autonomously in separate churches or organizations bearing different denominational or non-denominational names. Most, but not all Evangelical/Protestant groups are members of the Albania's Evangelical Brotherhood (VUSH), a cooperative organization which views itself as existing as \"an instrument of blessing … with the purpose of promoting unity amongst the churches, representing every local church with dignity, and promoting evangelism.\"\n\nOn August 26, 1816, Robert Pinkerton wrote the British and Foreign and Bible Society to encourage them to translate the New Testament into Albanian. Cyrus Hamlin reported in 1857 that Albanians were applying to his Protestant seminary. The first documented Albanian Protestant was Kostandin Kristoforidhi, who left his native Orthodox faith and converted to Protestantism on his own while comparing Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Protestant theological texts. He joined the Protestant Church of Smyrna in 1856 or 1857, and was sent to Istanbul for theological training.\n\nIn Monastir, Gjerasim Qiriazi also converted to Protestantism ca. 1876–1877, and united with the multi-ethnic Protestant church there. The first two known Albanian Protestant-Evangelical churches were both established by Gjerasim Qiriazi, first in Monastir in 1884 and later in Korça in 1890 (both cities then part of the Ottoman Empire).\n\nIn April 1890, Gjerasim Qiriazi was ordained as the first Albanian evangelist and preacher by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in the board's annual meeting help in Monastir. The second church among Albanians was opened in Korça. Qiriazi was also the head of one of the first national societies within Albania, named “The Evangelical Brotherhood”. As a result, Gjerasim Qiriazi is considered as the father of the Albanian Protestant Church.\n\n\n"}

These programs date back to at least 2002 and were revealed in March 2013 in the book \"Deep State: Inside the Government Secrecy Industry\", by Marc Ambinder and D.B. Grady.\n\nThese special programs are conducted under the code name RAGTIME (also abbreviated as RT), and are divided into several subcomponents. It's said that about fifty companies have provided data to this domestic collection program.\n\nRAGTIME consists of four parts: RAGTIME-A, RAGTIME-B, RAGTIME-C, and RAGTIME-P. \n\nAccording to the book \"Deep State\", only about three dozen NSA officials have access to RAGTIME's intercept data on domestic counter-terrorism collection, though outside the agency some 1000 people have knowledge of the program's details. Internally, the NSA has a compliance staff of about four or five people to ensure the program stays within laws and regulations. \n\nUnder the RAGTIME-P program, the FISA court and the US Attorney General both certify a slate of approved targets, which include bulk data, like phone call logs and records that can be collected around those targets. Apparently, RAGTIME-P can process as many as 50 different data sets at one time. \n\nAll intercepted data go to the NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, where a program called XKeyscore processes them and sending them to different so-called \"production lines\" that deal with targets, like counterterrorism or specific countries. These processed data are stored in different NSA databases like PINWALE for internet content and MARINA for internet metadata, which is generally stored for five years. \n\nOriginally, RAGTIME only applied to NSA Establishment FISA data, but in 2002 this was changed and since then the program encompasses both NSA Establishment FISA and FBI FISA data. According to Marc Ambinder, RAGTIME refers to phonecall and e-mail content intercepted under FISA authority.\n\n\n"}

It is subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. The agency is divided into five Regional Administrations (Riga, Kurzeme, Latgale, Vidzeme, Zemgale), which are responsible for policing priorities and the availability of public security police.\n\nThe founding date of the Latvian Police is considered to be 5 December 1918, when the transitional government of the newly-proclaimed Republic of Latvia, the People's Council of Latvia, approved the Temporary Regulations on the Internal Security Organization (Latvian: \"Pagaidu noteikumi par iekšējās apsardzības organizēšanu\"), which regulated the structure of the police force and put it under jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior of Latvia, led by Miķelis Valters. The date is now commemorated in Latvia as the Day of the Police. The regulations ordered the formation of 23 police districts - one for each district of Latvia and 6 prefectures of the largest cities (Riga, Liepāja, Daugavpils, Jelgava, Rēzekne, Ventspils).\n\nDue to the ongoing Latvian War of Independence and the lack of territory controlled by Latvian forces at that time, the force could only begin its activities in the summer of 1919 after the Latvian Army and its allies had liberated large parts of the country from the Red Army. Facing a lack of qualified personnel, the Police School at the Riga Prefecture was opened in the same year. \n\nAfter the war, the force was further divided into the Civil (\"Kārtības policija\"), Criminal (\"Kriminālpolicija\") and Secret Police (Political Police, \"Politiskā policija\"). The Latvian Criminal Police became a member of Interpol in 1929. After the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, the police force was dissolved and former servicemen persecuted under the Soviet regime. Law enforcement in the Latvian SSR was primarily the task of the Soviet militsiya.\n\nAfter the restoration of the independence of Latvia, the Latvian Police was re-established in 1991, with one of the first units being the 1st Police (Patrol) Battalion on 30 April 1991. The main task of the battalion, which was the first armed formations of the Latvian government, was to provide security of the Supreme Council of Latvia and strategically important buildings (government offices, radio and television). In 1992, the battalion was renamed as the Security Service of the Republic of Latvia, which was merged into the Military Police in 2010. Latvia rejoined Interpol in 1992. \n\n\n"}
