Viewers could watch games from their cable or satellite provider or on the ESPN3 broadband Internet service.\n\nEventually, with carriage of ESPN3 moving from computers only to smartphones, tablets and digital media players allowing access without any additional fees, GamePlan became a superfluous package, with only the few providers who refused to offer ESPN3 or where ESPN3 access was limited (for instance, rural areas) really able to compel viewers to use the service.\n\nOn August 28, 2015, the package was discontinued, along with ESPN Full Court, to make way for ESPN College Extra, which will offer a select bundle of games that would previously have been broadcast by GamePlan and Full Court.\n\nIn 1992, Showtime Event Television supplemented ABC's airing of regional college football telecasts by creating \"Option Play.\" This allowed viewers to watch games not airing on their local ABC station via pay-per-view. The original cost for a single game was $8.95 (with each additional game costing $1 extra), with the full \"season-ticket\" package priced between $49.95 and $69.95. The following year, ESPN took over for Showtime and offered the purchase of up to three individual Saturday afternoon blocks for $8.95, as opposed to only a single game. In 1993, the package was renamed \"Season Ticket\", followed in 1994 by \"ABC College Football on ESPN Pay-Per-View.\" In 1996, the name was again changed to \"ESPN GamePlan\", as the formation of ESPN Regional Television allowed for additional out-of-market games from conferences such as the Big Ten and MAC to be broadcast. ESPN would also pick up telecasts from other conferences such as the ACC, Big 12, Big East, Conference-USA, Mountain West, Pac-10, SEC and WAC for inclusion in GamePlan.\n\nUp to 15 games were provided each week.

{"id": "1387303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1387303", "title": "Elections in Liechtenstein", "text": "Elections in Liechtenstein\n\nElections in Liechtenstein take place at a national level within a multi-party system, with two dominant political parties. The Landtag of Liechtenstein has 25 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in two multi-seat constituencies. \n\nA variation of the standard party-list proportional format is used to elect 15 members from the district of Oberland and 10 members from the district of Unterland. The highest-remainder method dictates each party’s seat total in a district based on their vote share (which will be covered in more detail) there. Elections in these two districts are essentially separate, and the individual municipal divisions technically play no role in determining the eventual winners.\n\nThere are four parties currently registered in Liechtenstein: the FDP, Patriotic Union (VU), DU, and Free List (FL). Each party may nominate as many candidates in a district as can be elected there (15 available for Oberland and 10 for Unterland). Voters are assigned voting locations (either Oberland or Unterland district) based on their living. When voting, each voter must choose one party but is allowed to select as many candidates as they like (but only up to the maximum given: 15 candidate votes per Oberland voter and 10 candidate votes for each Unterland voter).\n\nAny ballots without a single party mark at the top are considered void, but will be accepted no matter how many candidates are chosen. If more candidates are chosen than the limit, the candidates following the fifteenth (if in Oberland) or tenth (if in Unterland) are ignored and only the first 15 (Oberland) or 10 (Unterland) distinct choices will count. If the name of a candidate is repeated, only in the first instance where the candidate is named is taken into consideration and all subsequent mentions are ignored.\n\nAlthough the number of candidates selected by each voter can vary and is up to their own determination, Oberland voters still must cast 15 total votes, and Unterland voters always give 10. The difference is made through the candidate rankings, which will be discussed later. Each candidate that is chosen by a voter counts as a vote for that candidate’s party. Each remaining vote out of the 15 (for Oberland) or 10 (for Unterland) corresponding to the number of candidates not chosen counts as a vote for the party initially specified by the voter.\n\nFor example, if a voter from Oberland chooses the FDP as their party of choice, and then chooses 4 candidates from the VU, 2 candidates from the FDP, and 1 candidate from the DU, then the \"party votes\" that this voter has cast are 4 for the VU, 1 for the DU, and 10 for the FDP (by virtue of the 2 votes for candidates from this party and the 8 remaining, empty candidate votes). Likewise, if an Unterland voter chooses DU as their party of choice, then casts 18 votes for the same FDP candidate and a vote for each of 2 VU candidates, then this voter’s party votes are counted as 1 for the FDP (since only 1 FDP candidate was selected), 2 for the VU, and 7 for the DU due to the 7 remaining candidate votes.\n\nNote that it is impossible for a voter to cast votes for any party other than the one listed at the top of their ballot without selecting the requisite number of candidates from that party. This has been criticized by some as restricting the freedom of voters to choose multiple parties while refraining from supporting at least 1 particular candidate.\n\nAlso keep in mind that a maximum of 1 vote can be cast for each candidate by a single voter, and thus it would be impossible for a given voter to cast multiple votes for a single candidate. Especially because parties may not nominate a full slate in a given district since the party usually desires maximum influence on the candidates elected and because it is unlikely for the party to win a very large majority of seats that they had not anticipated, voters who support just one party have complained that their influence is diminished because they can only support the candidates their party has nominated and thus their remaining votes would only count as party votes and not also candidate votes.\n\nAdditionally as fact, the expected transition by Liechtenstein authorities to new, electronic voting machines could eliminate the possibility of a voter selecting too many candidates, especially if mistakenly believing that they would all be counted and being told that they could only vote for 15 in the Oberland and 10 in the Unterland. The party choice for each voter does not matter if the voter chooses the maximum number of candidates that they are allowed (15 in Oberland and 10 in Unterland) but makes a difference of one party vote if they leave one candidate choice blank, and it counts as two party votes if two are unchecked.\n\nOnce the number of seats for each party in every district has been determined by the \"party vote\" count in that district, the corresponding candidates of that party with the highest number of votes are elected. For example, if the VU is given three seats in Unterland, then the 3 most popular VU candidates in Unterland are elected as the 3 representatives of the VU from the Unterland, regardless of how many votes these candidates garnered in relation to candidates from other parties.\n\nIf a party is given more seats in a district than the number of candidates that it has nominated there, then the extra seats are redistributed to the other parties as if the party of concern had not received that many votes also by using the Hare quota. In this case, the maximum number of seats that this party can earn in the relevant district is also equivalent to the total candidates it has nominated there.\n\nIt is important to note that votes for a party and votes for candidates are separate and affect the count differently: as explained above, party votes are used only for determining the number of seats given to a party in each district, while candidate votes determine which candidates from a party win election from each district, this value corresponding to the number of seats that the party in question receives as determined in the previous step.\n\nThis is also why the two districts are not compared outside of the separate elections: Oberland voters get 15 votes each and Unterland voters 10 votes, which would distort support if a party’s vote share is different between the two districts. However, this is evened out because the seats are determined by district, and therefore both districts are approximately equally represented since the ratio of seats between them must be roughly proportional to their population difference.\n\n\n"}

Its channels broadcast in French, English, Arabic, and Spanish.\n\nBased in the Paris suburb of Issy-les-Moulineaux, the service started on 6 December 2006. It is aimed at a worldwide market and is generally broadcast via satellite and cable operators around the world, but additionally, in 2010, France 24 began broadcasting through its own iPhone and Android apps. The stated mission of the channels is to \"provide a global public service and a common editorial stance\".\n\nSince 2008 the channel has been wholly owned by the French government, via its holding company France Médias Monde, having bought out the minority share of the former partners: Groupe TF1 and France Télévisions. The budget is approximately €100 million per year.\n\nFrance 24 is broadcast on four channels: in French, in English, in Arabic and in Spanish.\n\nFrance 24's programming is divided more or less equally between news coverage and news magazines or special reports.\n\nAlong with 260 journalists of its own, France 24 can call on the resources of the two main French broadcasters (Groupe TF1 and France Télévisions) as well as partners such as AFP and RFI. The CEO of France 24 is Alain de Pouzilhac. From 19 May 2010 and the Director of France 24 since 2012 is Marc Saikali, France 24 unveiled a new schedule that prioritizes the morning and evening slots, anchored live by the network's editorial staff. More programming space than ever before goes to business, sport, culture, and studio discussion.\n\nAs from 2016, France 24 shares its French-language night programming with the France-based France Info. According to Marie-Christine Saragosse, president and CEO of France Médias Monde, \"part of the value added of this public channel\" would be the fact that \"[France 24 journalists] will be wide awake while others would be sleeping\".\n\nThe media's perception was that the channel was a brainchild of former president Jacques Chirac, famous for defending the position of the French language in the world, specifically versus the English domination in this media category.\n\nIn 1987, then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac expressed his desire for an international television news channel in French and had requested a report into the activities of current international broadcasts from France (Radio France Internationale, TV5, and to a certain extent Réseau France Outre-Mer) and noted the collective offering was \"fragmented, disorganised and ineffective.\"\n\nWith the arrival of François Mitterrand as President in 1981 and the naming of Michel Rocard as Prime Minister in 1988, the government launched a new project, \"Canal France International\" (CFI), a package of programmes aimed at making programmes in French for foreign audiences, particularly in Africa, to be developed in parallel as a television channel.\n\nThe First Gulf War of 1990, relayed across the world by CNN International in particular, revealed the power of international news channels and their role in the formation of opinion. A parliamentary minister, Philippe Séguin, wished to create a French-language equivalent.\n\nIn 1996, after nineteen governmental reports in ten years, Prime Minister Alain Juppé asked Radio France Internationale president Jean-Paul Cluzel (who was also General Inspector of Finances) to create a French international news channel. Cluzel proposed in 1997 to group TV5, RFI, and CFI within a corporation entitled Téléfi. The UMP-led government decided to follow that recommendation but, with the return of the Socialist Party to government and the nomination of Hubert Védrine, the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, favoured the augmentation of existing outlets such as TV5, which started to produce its own programming, notably its news bulletins, which in turn created its own news team.\n\nAdditionally with the creation of EuroNews in 1993 (with French-language commentary), the media presence of France overseas became more complex, more fragmented, and costlier, without being able to rely on a true round-the-clock international news channel.\n\nIn 2002, President Jacques Chirac relaunched the project to create a French international news channel; after a speech given at a reception in honour of the High Council of the Francophonie at the 'Élysée on 12 February 2002, he stated:\n\n\"Is it understandable that year after year we are still lamenting our persistent failure with news and the French-language media on the international scene? Admittedly, we have with Agence France-Presse a remarkable information tool that we must continue to reinforce, notably in its international mission. Indeed, everyone here recognises the recent progress made by RFI, by TV5, by CFI, thanks to the efforts of their teams and to the determination of the public bodies. But everybody notices that we are still far from having a large international news channel in French, capable of competing with the BBC or CNN.\"\n\n\"The recent crises have shown the handicap that a country suffers, a cultural area, which doesn't possess a sufficient weight in the battle of the images and the airwaves. Let us question, in the time of terrestrial television networks, of satellite, of the internet, on our organisation in this domain, and notably in the dissipation of public funds which are reserved to them.\"\"\n\nOn 7 March, speaking in the French Senate in front of foreign delegates to France, and as part of his presidential campaign, Chirac said:\n\n\"We must have the ambition of a big, round-the-clock news channel in French, equal to the BBC or CNN for the English-speaking world. It is essential for the influence of our country. For our expatriates, it would be a live and an immediate link to the mainland\"\n\nAfter his reelection, the first reflections were engaged at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, headed by Dominique de Villepin. Various technical options were examined at the time, in an unreleased report:\n\n\nThe subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq reassured the authorities about the project, especially in February 2003, when the American broadcasters CNN, FOX News, and MSNBC opted not to broadcast the long applause given by the members of the United Nations Security Council after Dominique de Villepin gave his address on the Iraq conflict.\n\nOn 19 March 2003, Matignon opened offers to:\nElicit the development of an international news channel. Broadcasting primarily in the French language, this service will assure a more important and more visible presence of France in the worldwide battle of images, and to contribute to the pluralism of international information by offering to our viewers the choice of a different viewpoint on the news, marked by a singular point of view of our country on world affairs, by its culture and by its own ideas, and to value its historical links and its privileged geography. The international news channel must contribute to a long-lasting strategy of influence of France in the world.\n\nBy the application deadline on 22 April 2003, three candidates replied:\n\nOne month later, a parliamentary commission gave its conclusion, voted with a unanimous decision by its members in the National Assembly, to form a public-owned corporation \"(groupement d'intérêt public)\" grouping all of the public broadcasters (France Télévisions, RFO, RFI, TV5 and AFP) with the goal of launching the channel at the end of 2004.\n\nIgnoring the work of the parliamentary commission, the government asked a member of the assembly, Bernard Brochand, to form a partnership between the applying candidates for the international channel, something which the parliamentary commission did not demand. Brochard attempted to group both Groupe TF1 and Groupe Canal+, with no success. He then proposed a 50/50 partnership between France Télévisions and Groupe TF1 (whilst at the same time rejecting RFI), both groups possessing the technical means and experience of broadcasting externally: TF1 with its LCI channel and France Télévisions' editorial teams at France 2 and France 3.\n\nAfter a press conference in January 2004, President Chirac wished for a launch of the channel towards the end of the year. However, various disputes began to surface. The ministers of the assembly that voted were angry that the recommendations voted for in the parliamentary commission were thrown out in favour of one prepared outside the parliamentary framework. Unionised journalists working for France Télévisions denounced the potential alliance with the private sector, calling it \"the marriage of the snake and the rabbit\"; Radio France International was angry that it were not to be associated with the project. A headline published in \"Le Monde\" described the partnership having a \"public channel, private owner\", while other sections of the press criticised its modest budget of 80 million euro (compared with 600 million euro for BBC World). Finally the Minister for Foreign Affairs had worried that the budget would take away from existing funded channels such as TV5.\n\nFacing discontentment, the cabinet of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin delayed all discussion of the project in 2004. Then Foreign Minister Michel Barnier announced on 21 July that the channel would not be funded before 2007, which was confirmed by a vote in parliament on the Finance Bill.\n\nHowever, the Prime Minister acceded to pressure from the Élysée; a press conference by Raffarin on 9 December confirmed the launch of the new news channel in 2005.\n\n\"I have decided to accept the proposed joint venture proposed by France Télévisions and TF1. As desired by the President, the new channel will draw on the talents of major French television companies, and will promote the expression of a French vision, more necessary than ever in the world today. The Government will present an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the start of the channel, to a total of 30 million euro.\"\nThe amendment was carried the same day in the National Assembly.\n\nThe start of 2005 concerned obtaining the authorisation necessary from the European Union and the relevant competition commissions. Trade union members working for France Télévisions continued to voice opposition to the project and circulated a petition in March 2005. The newly elected president of the public corporation, Patrick de Carolis, who assumed his position in the summer (and who had been accused of being too close to the President), expressed doubts about an alliance with TF1:\n\n\"\"To be effective, you need a single driver in a car\".\"\n\nHe insisted that the channel be made available within France, which the members of parliament required, and which TF1, wanting to protect its own news channel LCI, could object to. Patrick Le Lay, president of TF1, gave his blessing for the channel to be broadcast domestically and wished the direction of the channel to alternate every six months between the two parties, and eventually a Supervisory Board devolved to France Télévisions. These few amendments needed new authorisation from the French and European authorities, obtained this time round without difficulty.\n\nThe launch of the channel was made official after a statement to the cabinet of the Ministry of Culture and Communication, headed by Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres on 30 November 2005:\n\n\" The project of the International French News Channel (abbreviated in French to CFII)[...] will allow us to propose our own country's vision of world events and to reinforce its presence in the world.\"\n\nAlain de Pouzilhac, former CEO of Havas, was named President, along with two deputies, one each from group partners TF1 and France Télévisions.\n\nPrime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin declared that CFII, against the wishes of TF1, would be broadcast within mainland France. However, TF1 wished to launch its news channel LCI onto the digital terrestrial platform. In order to placate TF1, CFII was due to be broadcast via satellite and cable.\n\nOn 22 April 2006, \"Le Monde\" announced that the managers of the forthcoming channel found its initial name difficult to pronounce (CFII, in French pronounced as \"C-F-I-I\" or \"C-F-2-I\"). A new name was announced on 30 June 2006; France 24 (pronounced \"France vingt-quatre\"). This decision was taken by the Supervisory Board, chaired by France Télévision president Patrick de Carolis, who made the choice from a list of five potential names.\n\nFrance 24 launched on 6 December 2006, initially available online as a web stream, followed by satellite distribution a day later, covering France and the rest of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the United States (specifically airing in New York State and the District of Columbia using two channels: one in English and the other in French. Since April 2007 the channel increased its reach, airing programmes in Arabic for viewers in the Maghreb, North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nTwo months after launch, a survey conducted by TNS Sofres indicated that 75% of respondents in France questioned thought France 24 was \"useful and essential\", but questions have arisen concerning the France 24 name being too Franco-centric for an international news channel.\n\nIn 2008 Groupe TF1 ceded its share in the channel to a government-owned holding company, Société de l'audiovisuel extérieur de la France (AEF), whilst conversely committing to producing programmes for the channel until 2015.\n\nDespite the launch of France 24, the fragmentation of public broadcasting overseas continues. The total budget for external broadcasting from France totalled 300 million euro each year. Following the election of Nicolas Sarkozy as President in May 2007, a \"steering committee\" of twenty members was called in with view to reform in June 2007. President Sarkozy called on Bernard Kouchner and Christine Albanel, respectively Foreign Minister and Culture Minister to reform the current system. The proposition of reform was met with concern from Belgium, Switzerland and Canada/Québec, as the public broadcasters involved in TV5 (of which the French government holds a 49% share whilst the three aforementioned countries hold 11% each) consider TV5 to be a promoter of the wider French-language world. Just one month after France 24's launch, TV5 renamed itself TV5MONDE.\n\nAs published in the \"Journal Officiel de la République Française\" of 23 January 2009, a Decree for 23 January 2009 appeared, \"authorising the company France Télévisions to cede its share in the capital of the France 24 company\". The same Decree transferred its share to the \"Société de l'audiovisuel extérieur de la France\" (AEF), which made AEF sole shareholder of France 24, for the sum of 4 million euro.\n\nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy announced on 8 January 2008 that he was in favour of reducing France 24's programming to French only.\n\nIn January 2012 AEF announced a merger between France 24 and Radio France International, a procedure finalised on 13 February 2012. It is expected that staff from Radio France International (which includes Arabic sister station Monte Carlo Doualiya) will move to premises currently home to France 24. Alain de Pouzilhac, president of AEF stated in \"Le Monde\":\n\n102 posts, of which 85 from RFI, were cut preceding the official merger. Editorial teams, technical and distribution, financial and human resources departments of both France 24 and RFI were involved. On 13 February 2012 the merger of France 24 and RFI was made official.\n\nFrance 24 aims to compete with leading English-language international news channels BBC World News and CNN International. Its intention is to put more emphasis on debate, dialogue and the role of cultural differences. It also competes with Deutsche Welle, Al Jazeera English, and NHK World news channels. The Arabic programming competes with Al Jazeera's Arabic service, RT Arabic, BBC Arabic and Sky News Arabia. The new Spanish channel for the Latin American market is expected to start in September 2017. It will compete with CNN en Español, DW (Latinoamérica), NTN24, TeleSUR, RT en español and CCTV-E\n\nThe French government allocated around €100 million for the project. The European Commission gave the green light to France 24 in June 2006, saying it did not breach European Union state aid rules.\n\nFrom 2 September 2016, France's new news channel, France Info, started simulcasting France 24 from midnight to 6am daily, when the channel doesn't broadcast live except the on-the-hour news bulletins.\n\nHowever, from 20 March 2017, on weekdays, France Info started simulcasting France 24 until 6:30 am, due to the main presenter Laurent Bignolas anchors the early newscast on France 2 \"Le 6H Info\", which isn't simulcast on France Info.\n\n\nFrance 24 is available by satellite in most of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as by cable and antenna in the US cities of New York; Washington, DC; Chicago; Philadelphia; the San Francisco Bay Area; and Atlanta, Georgia. In the United States, Canada, and Central and South America, France 24 is represented by the American telecommunications company New Line Television, headquartered in Miami, Florida. As of August 2010, the network also became available to subscribers to the satellite television Dish Network. An hour of France 24 news in English is shown in the United States on Free Speech TV at 6pm Eastern and 2am Eastern and on Link TV.\n\nThe French, English, and Arabic channels are all available live on the France 24 website, broadcast \"en direct\" (live) in Adobe Flash Video format. On 1 April 2007, the Irish terrestrial channel TG4, which is an Irish Language TV channel, began carrying retransmissions of France 24 overnight. Previously, it had retransmitted Euronews. France 24 is also available on Livestation.\n\nIn 2007, France 24 started a VOD service on Virgin Media, allowing customers to access weekly news updates and programmes to watch when they choose. The use of a free application means that France 24 is also available live and VOD on mobile phones throughout the world. An official App for the iPhone has also been released.\n\nIn October 2009, France24 relaunched its website France24.com with a complete video archive as well as a video-on-demand service whereby the viewer may watch any of the three channels with the ability to replay the past 24 hours of programming anytime. On 1 March 2010, France 24 released live streaming with experimental automatic transcription in association with Yacast Media, the search engine Exalead, Vocapia Research, and Microsoft.\n\nOn 2 March 2010, Iran blocked the news website of this French broadcaster.\n\nOn 9 January 2011, France 24's English and French channels officially switched to 16:9 widescreen at 02:00 CET, and the Arabic channel switched to widescreen later that day at 06:00 CET. Graphics were modified to fit the new format. The studio design was not altered. The video player at France24.com was also amended to accommodate the new format.\n\nFrance 24 is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative, which is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface, and has announced that it will launch an HbbTV interactive news service in 2012 via the Astra 19.2°E satellites with support from Orange and SES.\n\nIn New Zealand, the channels are available via Sky Network Television on channel 100 (English) and 101 (French). It is available via Now TV in Hong Kong and in Sri Lanka this channel is available via \nSri Lanka Telecom Peo TV on channel 27. In Pakistan, the channel is available on most cable systems, PTCL Smart TV and NayaTel.\n\nOn 3 October 2014, France 24 began live streaming the channel on YouTube.\n\nOn September 25, 2017, France 24 began to broadcast its Spanish version.\n\nOn January 9, 2018, France 24 was pulled from Spectrum cable TV.\n\n"}

The names of the princes were first recorded in Cosmas chronicle and then transmitted into the most of historical books of the 19th century including František Palacký's \"The History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia\". According to tradition, he was the father of the non-legendary prince Bořivoj. Some historians suppose that when St. Ludmila was born, Hostivít (or Svatopluk I of Moravia) and Ludmila's father, Slavibor, contracted that Bořivoj and Ludmilla would get married (that can refer to the wedding procession of an unknown bride mentioned in Annales Fuldenses for 871. According to the Chronicle of Dalimil, Hostivít had a brother called Děpolt who inherited the land of Kouřim.\n\nOne theory about the number of the princes is propped on the frescoes on the walls of the Rotunda in Znojmo, Moravia but Anežka Merhautová claimed that the frescoes depict all the members of the Přemyslid dynasty including the Moravian junior princes.\n\nHostivít's name is thought to be derived from the old Slavonic words \"hosti\" meaning \"guests\" and \"vítat\" meaning \"to welcome\". Záviš Kalandra thought the names of the seven princes were cryptical names of ancient Slavonic days of the week - Hostivít being the seventh - Saturday when the guests are welcome. Another theory says that the names were mistaken from a coherent and partly interrupted old Slavonic text.\n\n"}

The conclave which followed is considered to be the longest and most corrupt of the 18th century. The conclave opened on March 5 with thirty cardinals, but the numbers increased as more began to arrive. None of the Portuguese Cardinals were in attendance, apparently due to friction between Rome and Lisbon. There were fifty-six cardinals present. At some point in the four-month long ordeal, at least half had been proposed.\n\nOne voting bloc was made up of twelve cardinals who had been appointed by Benedict XIII, but this group had no clear leader. A second group was made up of cardinals appointed by Pope Alexander VIII. Politically, they were allied with the French party, which represented the interests of Louis XV. \n\nThe Imperial party were all subjects of the Austrian Emperor. This group included Cardinal Gianantonio Davia, a former papal nuncio to Vienna under salary from the imperial court. The Spanish party suffered from internal dissension, but was broadly allied with the Emperor. \n\nThere were also a Savoyard contingent representing Victor Amadeus II of Savoy, King of Sardinia; and the \"Zelanti\", who opposed all secular interference. In addition, the Florentine House of Medici was using financial enticements to forward their candidate, Lorenzo Corsini.\n\nNone of the factions were sufficiently large enough to bring a successful vote for their respective candidates.\n\nFrom about 1600 to the early 20th century, certain Catholic monarchs claimed the \"jus exclusivae\" (right of exclusion), i.e. to veto a candidate for the papacy, exercised through a crown-cardinal. By an informal convention, each state claiming the veto was allowed to exercise the right once per conclave. Therefore, a crown-cardinal did not announce the veto until the very last moment when the candidate in question seemed likely to get elected. This conclave saw a good deal of maneuvering by the various parties to induce another to exercise the veto prematurely. At one point, in lieu of a veto, the Spanish party threatened to exit the conclave if a particular opposition candidate was likely to be chosen.\n\nCardinal Cornelio Bentivoglio presented the veto of King Philip V of Spain against the election of Cardinal Giuseppe Renato Imperiali. During the conclave of 1700 Imperiali was part of a group of cardinals who were trying to resist the pressure applied by foreign governments aiming to influence papal elections. In 1720 he had attempted to influence the Republic of Genoa to arrest Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, an erstwhile court favorite made a duke and grandee of Spain. However, the veto had been signed by the Spanish Secretary of State rather than the King and was subject to a challenge. Matters dragged on while a messenger was sent to Madrid to obtain verification.\n\nThe Emperor had sent notification of his opposition to Cardinal Pietro Marcellino Corradini, who appeared to be leading with thirty votes. Corradini had opposed the Emperor's attempts at interference in the Papal States, and his attempt to name Hugh Francis Fustenberg bishop of Hildesheim. \n\nBy the middle of May there was a series of earthquakes in Italy. The tension was high, both inside and outside the Conclave, as many interpreted the earthquakes as evidence of God's displeasure at the failure of the Cardinals to elect a Pope.\n\nEventually Cardinal Cienfuegos persuaded the Germans to accept Corsini as an alternative to Corradini. The Spanish and French factions agreed. After months of contention, on July 12, 1730 Corsini was chosen and took the name of his patron, Clement XI. He was seventy-eight years of age at the time of his election and would rule for nearly ten years. One of Clement's first actions was to create a commission to investigate charges of embezzlement by various officials under his predecessor. \n\n"}

For their proposed pay TV offering, Real Digital intended to use a Conax conditional access system.\n\nReal Digital offered two kinds of set-top boxes, one with a single tuner and the other with a dual tuner PVR, which were manufactured by Fortec Star and Digital Stream.\n\nBefore launch, the company had missed many promised launch dates. The service eventually began broadcasting on 1 October 2011.\n\nTest boxes were received by reviewers and a small number of beta-testers in December 2011. production boxes still have not reached any high street retail stores, despite an agreement being announced with Maplin Electronics, although they had been carried by select specialist online retailers.\n\nWhile a number of set top boxes had been delivered to both testers and reviewers the first manufacturer Fortec Star was both late at delivering and incomplete software led to Maplin Electronics cancelling orders with Fortec Star. A number of live demonstrations to retailers showed the REAL Digital EPG and TV channel lists running and the GUI was widely praised.\n\nOn 31 March 2012 at midnight, the lease of the transponder on Eutelsat's Eutelsat 28A satellite ran out. The transponder was subsequently cleared, removing the EPG broadcast stream. Real Digital claim to be undergoing essential maintenance work, with the signal going offline for approximately 7 days. The move left the Real Digital beta-testers with nothing more than the DVB-S standard now and next programme information.\n\n, the stream has not returned and on 11 April 2012 Real Digital claimed on Facebook that work had halted due to the Easter break. Another Facebook post on 2 May 2012, denied that the service had closed but no further updates would be provided until there was definite news. On 29 May 2012, Real Digital deleted their Facebook page and removed all links to it from their website.\n\n, the company is still listed as active by Companies House.\n\nOn 5 December 2012 Real Digital submitted a communication to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, in which Real Digital stated that it hoped to have a \"soft launch\" of a pay TV service in the first quarter of 2013, however this failed to occur. On 26 April 2013, David Henry informed The Guardian that the service intends to launch in the autumn, but this did not happen.\n\nThe company was founded by former Rapture TV boss David Henry and Information TV boss Fred Perkins. On 11 November 2011, David Henry was disqualified from acting as a company director after failing to ensure that one of his former companies paid the appropriate amount of tax. David Henry had been acting as managing director of Real Digital until he resigned on 21 February 2012 from the company. As of 14 October 2013, Frederick J. Perkins has become an inactive company director for Real Digital, Wouter V. Ruth is now the only active acting company director and secretary.\n\nOver a period of almost 2 years (2014-2016) REAL Digital saw a Russian-based company called General Satellite Group hold a majority of the voting shares in REAL Digital TV Limited. Recent (2016) Companies House filings record that General Satellite Group no longer hold any shares in the company. REAL Digital has moved its registered address to a business unit.\n\nDmitry Pasechnik is no longer the CEO of REAL Digital TV Limited he was placed on the board by his employer General Satellite Group while they held voting shares in the company.\n\n\n"}

The annual scholarship supported selected artists and creative individuals under the age of 30 with a £30,000 bursary and mentor support to help them develop to the next stage of their careers. It was part of the Sky Academy programme from 2013 until its final year in 2016.\n\nThe Sky Academy Arts Scholarship originally started as the Sky Arts Ignition:Futures Fund in 2011, before becoming part of the new Sky Academy in 2013. Applicants were required to complete an application detailing the project they would complete while they were on the scholarship, and with around a 1000 applicants a year this would be whittled down for a panel of art experts to make the final decision. The panel changed each year and former members have included Godfrey Worsdale (former Director of BALTIC Contemporary Art Gallery); Louise Jeffreys (Director of Arts, Barbican); Radio presenter Jo Whiley; Nancy Durrant (Arts Commissioning Editor for The Times); Iwona Blazwick (Director of Whitechapel Gallery); Cam Blackwood (Music producer).\n\nMelvyn Bragg, who was an ambassador at the Sky Academy stated \"I genuinely believe that the Sky Arts Scholarships are a substantial and far-sighted contribution to the best arts practice in this country,\nand already we see tremendous talents being encouraged and developed as a result of it\" and in an interview with the Radio Times he said about the scholarship \"People seem to think the arts just pop out of the ground. They don’t. Young people need support, and our scheme should be replicated all over the place. The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Opera House all get whacking great subsidies from us as taxpayers. Why don’t each of them sponsor five or ten scholarships a year?\" The winners of the scholarships were announced at the South Bank Sky Arts Awards until 2016 when the scholarship was dropped. \n\nWinners of the scholarship have included Mark Simpson who went onto win the South Bank Sky Arts Award for Classical Music which he wrote while on his scholarship, while Sabrina Mahfouz whose Edinburgh Festival play \"Chef\" was written during her scholarship and won the Fringe First Award.\n"}

{"id": "240727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240727", "title": "Sphere of influence", "text": "Sphere of influence\n\nIn the field of international relations, a sphere of influence (SOI) is a spatial region or concept division over which a state or organization has a level of cultural, economic, military, or political exclusivity, accommodating to the interests of powers outside the borders of the state that controls it.\n\nWhile there may be a formal alliance or other treaty obligations between the influenced and influencer, such formal arrangements are not necessary and the influence can often be more of an example of soft power. Similarly, a formal alliance does not necessarily mean that one country lies within another's sphere of influence. High levels of exclusivity have historically been associated with higher levels of conflict.\n\nIn more extreme cases, a country within the \"sphere of influence\" of another may become a subsidiary of that state and serve in effect as a satellite state or de facto colony. The system of spheres of influence by which powerful nations intervene in the affairs of others continues to the present. It is often analyzed in terms of superpowers, great powers, and/or middle powers.\n\nSometimes portions of a single country can fall into two distinct spheres of influence. In the colonial era the buffer states of Iran and Thailand, lying between the empires of Britain/Russia and Britain/France respectively, were divided between the spheres of influence of the imperial powers. Likewise, after World War II, Germany was divided into four occupation zones, which later consolidated into West Germany and East Germany, the former a member of NATO and the latter a member of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe term is also used to describe non-political situations, e.g., a shopping mall is said to have a sphere of influence which designates the geographical area where it dominates the retail trade.\n\nMany areas of the world are considered to have inherited culture from a previous sphere of influence, that while perhaps today halted, continues to share the same culture. Examples include the Anglosphere, Arab World, Eurosphere, Francophonie, Françafrique, Germanosphere, Indosphere, Latin Europe/Latin America, Lusophonie, Turkosphere, Chinese cultural sphere, Slavisphere, Hispanophone, Malay World, as well as many others.\n\nAn example of spheres of influence was China in the late 19th and early 20th Century, when Britain, France, Germany, and Russia (later replaced by Japan) had de facto control over large swaths of territory. These were taken by means of military attacks or threats to force Chinese authorities to sign unequal treaties and very long term \"leases\". \nIn December 1897 German Kaiser Wilhelm II declared his intent to seize territory in China, precipitating the scramble to demarcate zones of influence in China. The German government acquired, in Shandong province, exclusive control over developmental loans, mining, and railway ownership, while Russia gained, in addition to the previous tax exemption for trade in Mongolia and Xinjiang, economic powers similar to Germany's over Fengtian, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. France gained a sphere over Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, Japan over Fujian province, and the British Empire over the whole Yangtze River Valley and Tibet. Only Italy's request for Zhejiang province was declined by the Chinese government. These do not include the lease and concession territories where the foreign powers had full authority.\n\nIn 1902, Winston Churchill gave a speech regarding the division of China by the great powers, where he declared that \"we shall have to take the Chinese in hand and regulate them\", \"I believe in the ultimate partition of China\" and \"the Aryan stock is bound to triumph\".\n\nThe Russian government militarily occupied their zone, imposed their law and schools, seized mining and logging privileges, settled their citizens, and even established their municipal administration on several cities, the latter without Chinese consent.\n\nThe powers (and the United States) might have their own courts, post offices, commercial institutions, railroads, and gunboats in what was on paper Chinese territory. However, the foreign powers and their control in some cases could have been exaggerated; the local government persistently restricted further encroachment. The system ended after the Second World War.\nIn the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, Britain and Russia partitioned Persia (Iran) into spheres of influence, with the Russians gaining recognition for influence over most of northern Iran, and Britain establishing a zone in the Southeast.\n\nFor Siam (Thailand), Britain and France signed an agreement in 1904 whereby the British recognised a French sphere of influence to the east of the River Menam's (Chao Phraya River) basin; in turn, the French recognised British influence over the territory to the west of the Menam basin and west of the Gulf of Thailand. Both parties disclaimed any idea of annexing Siamese territory.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, aimed for the United States to establish a sphere of influence in North America. Hamilton, writing in the Federalist Papers, harboured ambitions for the U.S. to rise to world power status and gain the strength to expel European powers from the Americas, taking on the mantle of regional dominance among American nations, although most of the New World were European colonies during that period.\n\nThis doctrine was formalised under President James Monroe, who asserted that the New World was to be established as a Sphere of influence, removed from European encroachment. As the U.S. emerged as a world power, few nations dared to trespass on this sphere.\n\nAs of 2018, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson continued to refer to the Monroe doctrine to tout the United States as the region's preferred trade partner over other nations such as China.\n\nFor another example, during the height of its existence in World War II, the Japanese Empire had quite a large sphere of influence. The Japanese government directly governed events in Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, and parts of Mainland China. The \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" could thus be quite easily drawn on a map of the Pacific Ocean as a large \"bubble\" surrounding the islands of Japan and the Asian and Pacific nations it controlled.\n\nAccording to a secret protocol attached to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939 (revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945), Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into Nazi and Soviet spheres of influence. In the North, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet sphere. Poland was to be partitioned in the event of its \"political rearrangement\"—the areas east of the Narev, Vistula, and San Rivers going to the Soviet Union while Germany would occupy the west. Lithuania, adjacent to East Prussia, would be in the German sphere of influence, although a second secret protocol agreed in September 1939 assigned Lithuania to the USSR. Another clause of the treaty stipulated that Bessarabia, then part of Romania, would join the Moldovan ASSR and become the Moldovan SSR under the control of Moscow. The Soviet invasion of Bukovina on 28 June 1940 violated the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence as agreed with the Axis. The USSR continued to deny the existence of the Pact's protocols until after the dissolution of the USSR when the Russian government fully acknowledged the existence and authenticity of the secret protocols.\n\nFrom 1941 and the German attack on the Soviet Union, the Allied Coalition operated on the unwritten assumption that the Western Powers and the Soviet Union had each its own sphere of influence. The presumption of the US-British and Soviet unrestricted rights in their respective spheres started causing difficulties as the Nazi-controlled territory shrank and the allied powers successively liberated other states. The wartime spheres lacked a practical definition and it had never been determined if a dominant allied power was entitled to unilateral decisions only in the area of military activity, or could also force its will regarding political, social and economic future of other states. This overly informal system backfired during the late stages of the war and afterwards, when it turned out that the Soviets and the Western Allies had very different ideas concerning the administration and future development of the liberated regions and of Germany itself.\n\nDuring the Cold War the Baltic states, Central Europe, some countries in Eastern Europe, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, North Korea, and, until the Sino-Soviet split, the People's Republic of China, among other countries at various times, were said to lie under the Soviet sphere of influence. Western Europe, Oceania, Japan, and South Korea, among other places, were often said to lie under the sphere of influence of the United States. However, the level of control exerted in these spheres varied and was not absolute. For instance, France and Great Britain were able to act independently to invade (with Israel) the Suez Canal (they were later forced to withdraw by joint U.S. and Soviet pressure). Later, France was also able to withdraw from the military arm of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Cuba often took positions that put it at odds with its Soviet ally, including momentary alliances with the People's Republic of China, economic reorganizations, and providing support for insurgencies in Africa and the Americas without prior approval from the Soviet Union. \n\nWith the end of the Cold War, the Eastern Bloc fell apart, effectively ending the Soviet sphere of influence. Then in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, replaced by the Russian Federation and several other ex-Soviet Republics who became independent states.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, the countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia that became independent were often portrayed as part of the Russian Federation's \"sphere of influence\". According to Ulrich Speck, writing for \"Carnegie Europe\", \"After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the West's focus was on Russia. Western nations implicitly treated the post-Soviet countries (besides the Baltic states) as Russia's sphere of influence.\"\n\nIn 1997, NATO and Russia signed the \"Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security\", stating the \"aim of creating in Europe a common space of security and stability, without dividing lines or spheres of influence limiting the sovereignty of any state.\"\n\nIn 2009, Russia asserted that the European Union desires a sphere of influence and that the Eastern Partnership is \"an attempt to extend\" it. In March 2009, Sweden's foreign minister Carl Bildt stated that \"The Eastern Partnership is not about spheres of influence. The difference is that these countries themselves opted to join\".\n\nFollowing the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Václav Havel and other former central and eastern European leaders signed an open letter stating that Russia had \"violated the core principles of the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris... -all in the name of defending a sphere of influence on its borders.\" In April 2014, NATO stated that \"Contrary to [the Founding Act], Russia now appears to be attempting to recreate a sphere of influence by seizing a part of Ukraine, maintaining large numbers of forces on its borders, and demanding, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently stated, that “Ukraine cannot be part of any bloc.”\" Criticising Russia in November 2014, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that \"old thinking about spheres of influence, which runs roughshod over international law\" put the \"entire European peace order into question\". In January 2017, British Prime Minister Theresa May said, \"We should not jeopardise the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putin's claim that it is now in his sphere of influence.\"\n\nIn corporate terms, the sphere of influence of a business, organization or group can show its power and influence in the decisions of other businesses/organizations/groups. Influence shows in several ways, such as in size, frequency of visits, etc. In most cases, a company described as \"bigger\" has a larger sphere of influence.\n\nFor example, the software company Microsoft has a large sphere of influence in the market of operating systems; any entity wishing to sell a software product may weigh up compatibility with Microsoft's products as part of a marketing plan.\n\nIn another example, retailers wishing to make the most profits must ensure they open their stores in the correct location. This is also true for shopping centers that, to reap the most profits, must be able to attract customers to their vicinity.\n\nThere is no defined scale measuring such spheres of influence. However, one can evaluate the spheres of influence of two shopping centers by seeing how far people are prepared to travel to each shopping center, how much time they spend in its vicinity, how often they visit, the order of goods available, etc.\n\nFor historical and current examples of significant battles over spheres of influence see:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "636806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=636806", "title": "Total fertility rate", "text": "Total fertility rate\n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR), sometimes also called the fertility rate, absolute/potential natality, period total fertility rate (PTFR), or total period fertility rate (TPFR) of a population is the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if:\n\nIt is obtained by summing the single-year age-specific rates at a given time. \n\nThe TFR is a synthetic rate, not based on the fertility of any real group of women since this would involve waiting until they had completed childbearing. Nor is it based on counting up the total number of children actually born over their lifetime. Instead, the TFR is based on the age-specific fertility rates of women in their \"child-bearing years\", which in conventional international statistical usage is ages 15–44 or 15–49.\n\nThe TFR is, therefore, a measure of the fertility of an \"imaginary\" woman who passes through her reproductive life subject to \"all\" the age-specific fertility rates for ages 15–49 that were recorded for a given population in a given year. The TFR represents the average number of children a woman \"would\" potentially have, were she to fast-forward through all her childbearing years in a single year, under all the age-specific fertility rates for that year. In other words, this rate is the number of children a woman would have if she was subject to prevailing fertility rates at all ages from a single given year, and survives throughout all her childbearing years.\n\nAn alternative fertility measure is the net reproduction rate (NRR), which measures the number of \"daughters\" a woman would have in her lifetime if she were subject to prevailing age-specific fertility \"and mortality\" rates in the given year. When the NRR is exactly one, then each generation of women is exactly reproducing itself. The NRR is less widely used than the TFR, and the United Nations stopped reporting NRR data for member nations after 1998. But the NRR is particularly relevant where the number of male babies born is very high due to gender imbalance and sex selection. This is a significant factor in world population, due to the high level of gender imbalance in the very populous nations of China and India. The gross reproduction rate (GRR), is the same as the NRR, except that—like the TFR—it ignores life expectancy. \n\nThe TFR (or TPFR—total period fertility rate) is a better index of fertility than the crude birth rate (annual number of births per thousand population) because it is independent of the age structure of the population, but it is a poorer estimate of actual completed family size than the total cohort fertility rate, which is obtained by summing the age-specific fertility rates that actually applied to each cohort as they aged through time. In particular, the TFR does not necessarily predict how many children young women now will eventually have, as their fertility rates in years to come may change from those of older women now. However, the TFR is a reasonable summary of current fertility levels. \n\nThe TPFR (total \"period\" fertility rate) is affected by a tempo effect—if age of childbearing increases (and life cycle fertility is unchanged) then while the age of childbearing is increasing, TPFR will be lower (because the births are occurring later), and then the age of childbearing stops increasing, the TPFR will increase (due to the deferred births occurring in the later period) even though the life cycle fertility has been unchanged. In other words, the TPFR is a misleading measure of life cycle fertility when childbearing age is changing, due to this statistical artifact. This is a significant factor in some countries, such as the Czech Republic and Spain in the 1990s. Some measures seek to adjust for this timing effect to gain a better measure of life-cycle fertility. \n\nReplacement fertility is the total fertility rate at which women give birth to enough babies to sustain population levels.\n\nIf there were no mortality in the female population from birth to the end of the childbearing years, the replacement level of TFR would be very close to 2.0. The replacement fertility rate is indeed only slightly above 2.0 births per woman for most industrialized countries (2.075 in the UK, for example), but ranges from 2.5 to 3.3 in developing countries because of higher mortality rates, especially child mortality. The global average for the replacement total fertility rate (leading to a stable global population) was 2.33 children per woman in 2003.\n\nThe term \"lowest-low fertility\" is defined as TFR at or below 1.3. This is characteristic of some Eastern European, Southern European and East Asian countries. In 2001, more than half of the population of Europe lived in countries with lowest-low TFR, but TFRs have since slightly increased there.\nA population that maintained a TFR of 3.8 over an extended period without a correspondingly high death or emigration rate would increase rapidly (doubling period ~ 32 years), whereas a population that maintained a TFR of 2.0 over a long time would decrease, unless it had a large enough immigration. However, it may take several generations for a change in the total fertility rate to be reflected in birth rate, because the age distribution must reach equilibrium. For example, a population that has recently dropped below replacement-level fertility will continue to grow, because the recent high fertility produced large numbers of young couples who would now be in their childbearing years.\n\nThis phenomenon carries forward for several generations and is called population momentum, \"population inertia\" or \"population-lag effect\". This time-lag effect is of great importance to the growth rates of human populations.\nTFR (net) and long term population growth rate, g, are closely related. For a population structure in a steady state and with zero migration, g equals log(TFR/2)/Xm, where Xm is mean age for childbearing women and thus P(t) = P(0)exp(gt). At the left side is shown the empirical relation between the two variables in a cross-section of countries with most recent y-y growth rate. The parameter 1/b should be an estimate of the Xm; here equal to 1/0.02 = 50 years, way off the mark because of population momentum. E.g. for log(TFR/2) = 0, g should be exactly zero, which is seen not to be the case.\n\nDeveloped countries usually have a significantly lower fertility rate, often correlated with greater wealth, education, urbanization, or other factors. Mortality rates are low, birth control is understood and easily accessible, and costs are often deemed very high because of education, clothing, feeding, and social amenities. With wealth, contraception becomes affordable. In countries like Iran where contraception was subsidized before the economy accelerated, birth rate also rapidly declined. Further, longer periods of time spent getting higher education often mean women have children later in life. Female labor participation rate also has substantial negative impact on fertility, but not in all countries (for countries in the OECD, increased female labor participation has been associated with increased fertility).\n\nIn undeveloped countries on the other hand, families desire children for their labour and as caregivers for their parents in old age. Fertility rates are also higher due to the lack of access to contraceptives, stricter adherence to traditional religious beliefs, generally lower levels of female education, and lower rates of female employment in industry. The total fertility rate for the world has been declining very rapidly since the 1990s. Some forecasters like Sanjeev Sanyal argue that, adjusted for gender imbalances, the effective global fertility will fall below replacement rate in the 2020s. This will stabilize world population by 2050, which is much sooner than the UN Population Division expects. If the global TFR falls as much as it did from year 1995 to 2000, by 0.25 points, in 2015 to 2020, then that would result in global TFR being 2.11 by year 2020 ( it was 2.36 in 2010-2015 period). 2.11 is the exact global replacement rate of humanity. However if it falls as much as it did from 1975 to 1980, by 0.61 points( It was 4.45 TFR in 1975 and 3.84 TFR by 1980), then the global TFR would be a very low and dangerous 1.75 kids per woman, well below replacement level,by year 2020.\n\nThis situation of wealthy countries usually having a lower fertility rate than poor countries is part of the fertility-income paradox, as the very high fertility countries are very poor, and it may seem counter-intuitive for families there to have so many children. The inverse relationship between income and fertility has been termed a \"demographic-economic \"paradox\"\" by the notion that greater means would enable the production of more offspring, as first suggested by demographic scholar Thomas Malthus in 1798.\n\nGovernments have often set population targets, to either increase or decrease the total fertility rate; or to have certain ethnic or socioeconomic groups have a lower of higher fertility rate. Often such policies have been interventionist, and abusive. The most notorious natalist policies of the 20th century include those in communist Romania and communist Albania, under Nicolae Ceaușescu and Enver Hoxha respectively. The policy of Romania (1967-1990) was very aggressive, including outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, taxes on childlessness, and legal discrimination against childless people; and resulted in large numbers of children put into Romanian orphanages by parents who couldn't cope with raising them, street children in the 1990s (when many orphanages were closed and the children ended up on the streets), overcrowding in homes and schools, and over 9,000 women who died due to illegal abortions. Conversely, in China the government sought to lower the fertility rate, and, as such, enacted the one child policy (1978-2015), which included abuses such as forced abortions. Some governments have sought to regulate which groups of society could reproduce through eugenic policies of forced sterilizations of 'undesirable' population groups. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the first half of the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in Peru, President Alberto Fujimori (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of genocide and crimes against humanity as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the Quechuas and the Aymaras). Within this historical contexts, the notion of reproductive rights has developed. Such rights are based on the concept that each person freely decides if, when, and how many children to have - not the state or church. According to the OHCHR reproductive rights \"rest on the recognition of the basic rights of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes the right to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence, as expressed in human rights documents\".\n\nThe total fertility rate in the US after World War II peaked at about 3.8 children per woman in the late 1950s and by 1999 was at 2 children. The fertility rate of the total US population was just below the replacement level of about 1.9 children per woman in 1979. However, the fertility of the population of the United States is below replacement among those native born, and above replacement among immigrant families, most of whom come to the U.S. from countries with higher fertility than that of the U.S. However, the fertility rates of immigrants to the U.S. have been found to decrease sharply in the second generation, correlating with improved education and income. As of the beginning of 2016, there are 59.8 births per 1,000 women aged 15–44; this is the lowest number since records have been kept since 1909.\nThe lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history is for Xiangyang district of Jiamusi city (Heilongjiang, China) which had a TFR of 0.41. Outside China, the lowest TFR ever recorded was 0.80 for Eastern Germany in 1994. The low Eastern German value was influenced by a change to higher age at birth, with the consequence that neither older cohorts (e.g. women born until the late 1960s), who often already had children, nor younger cohort, which often gave childbirth at a higher age (i.e. after 1994), had many children during that time. The total cohort fertility rate of each age cohort of woman in East German did not drop as significantly.\n\nThe average total fertility rate in the European Union (EU-28) is calculated at 1.58 children per woman in 2015. Most Southern European countries have very low TFR (Portugal 1.31, Cyprus, 1.32, Greece 1.33, Spain 1.33, Italy 1.35). Poland also has a very low TFR (1.32). France has the highest TFR at 1.96, followed by Ireland (1.92), Sweden (1.85), the UK (1.80) and Denmark (1.71). The other non-EU Scandinavian countries also have high TFR (Iceland 1.80, Norway 1.72).\n\nIn the non-EU European post-Soviet states group in 2016, Russia has a TFR of 1.61, Moldova 1.56, Ukraine 1.54, and Belarus 1.48. In former Yugoslavian states, Bosnia has a very low TFR, at only 1.28, the lowest of the whole of Europe.\n\nEmigration of young adults from Eastern Europe to the West aggravates the demographic problems of those countries. People from countries such as Moldova, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria are particularly moving abroad.\n\nThe TFR of Singapore, Macau, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea are the lowest in the world, with Singapore and Macau having a TFR below 1 in 2017. Japan too has a low TFR (1.45 in 2016). Singapore mitigates this through immigrant workers, but in Japan there is a serious demographic problem.\n\nIn South Korea, too, a low birthrate is one of its most urgent socio-economic challenges.\nRising housing expenses, shrinking job opportunities for younger generations, insufficient support to families with newborns either from the government or employers are among the major explanations for its crawling TFR, from 1.08 in 2005 to 1.17 in 2016. Koreans are yet to find viable solutions to make the birthrate rebound, even after trying out dozens of programs over a decade, including subsidizing rearing expenses, giving priorities for public rental housing to couples with multiple children, funding day care centers, reserving seats in public transportation for pregnant women, etc.\n\nThis region of the world has the highest TFR (Niger, Burundi, Mali, Somalia, and Uganda are highest). The poverty of the region, and the high maternal mortality and infant mortality had led to calls from WHO of family planning and encouragement of smaller families.\n\nA parent's number of children strongly correlates with the number of children that each person in the next generation will eventually have. Factors generally associated with increased fertility include religiosity, intention to have children, and maternal support. Factors generally associated with decreased fertility include wealth, education, female labor participation, urban residence, intelligence, widespread birth control usage, increased female age and (to a lesser degree) increased male age. Many of these factors however are not universal, and differ by region and social class. For instance, at a global level, religion is correlated with increased fertility, but in the West less so: Scandinavian countries and France are among the least religious in the EU, but have the highest TFR, while the opposite is true about Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Poland and Spain.\n\n\n\nDynamics:\n\nCase studies:\n\nLists:\n\n"}
{"id": "1476272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1476272", "title": "Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte", "text": "Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte\n\nIn the 840s, viking Norsemen were entering the Frankish territories as raiders and, gradually, became settlers. The conception of Normandy as a nationhood was not yet founded; there was no unified duchy. Rather there was northwest Neustria, or Annals of St Bertain, which was commonly referred to as March of Brittany, the region between Seine and Loire, and no man's land. There are territories where various vikings prevailed. \n\nIn the late Ninth Century the Vikings began raiding what is now known as northern France. The raid was made possible by navigating ships down the River Seine to Paris and Chartres. As they sailed, the Vikings would stop along their route to rape, pillage, and raid towns and churches. One such town that suffered a disastrous fate was the village of Saint Clair-Sur-Epte; in 885 A. D. it was burned by the Vikings in 885 A.D. In 911, a group of Vikings led by the Norwegian Rollo launched a surprise attack on Paris before laying siege to Chartres. Appeals for help from the Bishop of Chartres, Joseaume, were answered by Robert, Marquis of Neustria, Richard, Duke of Burgundy and Manasses, Count of Dijon. On 20 July 911, at the Battle of Chartres, they defeated Rollo despite the absence of many French barons and of Charles the Simple. After the Frankish victory near Chartres on 26 August, Charles decided to negotiate with Rollo. \n\nThe talks, led by Hervé, the Archbishop of Reims, resulted in the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte in 911. The treaty granted Rollo and his soldiers all the land between the river Epte and the sea \"in freehold and good money\". \nIn addition, it granted him Brittany \"for his livelihood.\" At the time, Brittany was an independent country which present day France had unsuccessfully tried to conquer. In exchange, Rollo guaranteed the king his loyalty, which involved military assistance for the protection of the kingdom against other Vikings. One of the conditions for the Vikings after their loss was to convert. As a token of his goodwill, Rollo also agreed to be baptized and to marry Gisela, a presumed legitimate daughter of Charles. \n\nWith viking bands of settlers, composed of non-aristocratic lineages, there came multiple communities formed and a new political ethos that was not Frankish. The Vikings slowly became known as \"Northmen,\" from which \"Normandy\" and \"Normans\" are derived. This identity formation was partly possible because Vikings were adapting indigenous culture, speaking French, renouncing paganism and converting to Christianity, and intermarrying with the local population. Though, conversion and assimilation was taking place, it is important to remember that the process for cultivating a Christian end-product society was slow. The culture was, at this time, a hybrid. But the \"traité en forme\" at Saint Clair-Sur-Epte marked the beginning of Normandy as a state.\n\nThe territory covered by the treaty corresponds to the northern part of today's Upper Normandy down to the Seine, but the territory of the Vikings would eventually extend west beyond the Seine to form the Duchy of Normandy, so named because of the Norsemen who ruled it. The treaty allowed these new settlements. But not all Vikings were welcome. And with the death of Alan I, King of Brittany, another group of Vikings occupied Brittany faced their own dispute. Around 937, Alan I's son Alan II returned from England to expel those Vikings from Brittany in a war that was concluded in 939. During this period the Cotentin Peninsula was lost by Brittany and gained by Normandy.\n\nThere would be a convergence between Franks and Normans with a few generations. But for now, the treaty involved a marriage between Gisla and Hrólfr (also known Rollo to the Franks). Marriages such as this played an important role in cultivating alliances and cohesion; wives were often called \"peace weavers.\" And later, Charles the Simple created an alliance and a grant of rights to those Vikings seeking to settle in 918.\n\nWhile Vikings did adapt, adopt, and assimilate to Christianity, they did not necessarily adopt indigenous administration: \"The creation of Norman power between first settlement and the mid-eleventh century is not primarily of assimilation to Carolingian forms, as those appear in the capitualaries. Rather, the Vikings \"adhered longer than the Franks around them--to older forms of social organization,\" that the Franks were abandoning. \n\nThe Vikings came close to being absorbed into a lower social strata in Frankish society had not a wave of invading Vikings occurred in the 960s. Over time, the frontiers of the duchy, based in kinship, expanded to the west. \"By the mid-eleventh century the descendants of the settlers formed the most disciplined, cooperative warrior society in Europe, capable of a communal effort--the conquest and subjugation of England--that was not, and could not have been, mounted by any other European political entity.\" \n\nThere was not a successful duchy until around the time of Richard I control of Normandy. During his reign he bore daughters who would become peace weavers to forge valuable marriage alliances with powerful neighboring counts and the king of England.[19] His daughter, Emma, underwent two marriages. In 1002, King Æthelred II married Emma, the sister of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. After Æthelred the Unready's death in 1016, Emma marriage her second husband who was an invader: Cnut the Great. Emma and Æthelred the Unready's children included Alfred Aetheling and Edward the Confessor. Emma also bore children with Cnut: Haracnut and a daughter, Gunnhild. This is not to mention Cnut's previous child in his previous marriage: Harold Harafoot. While the complicated woven connections that marriage brought could bring peace, the alliances, and stability, once the alliance of Cnut and Emma ended, there was a battle over the throne. Emma's children with Æthelred the Unready give a major connection between Normandy and England that would add validity to William the Conqueror's claim to the throne of England later on. \n\nOn 12th November 1035, King Cnut, died at Shaftsbury in Dorset. He was around 40 years old and was buried at the Winchester Abbey. With his death, a succession Crisis was created, and his huge Northern European Empire, which contained England, Denmark, Norway, and Scania, fell apart because of strife over which heir would control certain regions. For instance, Harold Harefoot tried to seize the throne of England; he is able to rule the \"North of the river of Thames\" until 1035 when he \"failed to prevail over the archbishop.\" Meanwhile, South of the River Thames, Haracnut reigned, \"but was deserted by his supporters in 1037.\" In 1037, Harold Harefoot ascended the throne \"as king everywhere\" But with his death came the accession of Haracnut. Essentially, all of Cnut's children, whether illegitimate or not, there was interest in the throne of England; that is, the male heirs.\n\nHow this relates to Normandy is with Edward the Confessor's claim to the throne. He was an illegitimate child of Cnut because he came from Emma's first marriage. The result of not being a direct son of Cnut, meant Edward and his brother spent most of their lives in Normandy as an exile to England. This dynamic led to the establishment of a powerful Norman interest in English politics. Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Edward was childless and embroiled in conflict with the formidable Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his sons, and he may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy's ambitions for the English throne.\" And so, he laid claim to the English throne while Haracnut was King. Eventually, William would not only stake a claim to the English crown, but take advantage of the fragmented state of England due to the Great Succession Crisis and its aftermath.\n\nBefore William left for England, he had to gained support and unify Normandy as a consolidated state. But to maintain this unity in Normandy meant William needed to make sure that his neighbors, such as France, were not a threat. William was able to leave for his invasion with the aid of churches and ducal administration, as well as the timely death of France’s King; all of these circumstances and dynamics secured William’s power.\nWilliam was able to accomplished the defeat of England by invading and landing his ships in Dives. There, William was met with Harold II on the battle field, and the Battle of Hastings ensued in the fall of 1066. Bradbury asserts the Battle of Hastings events unfolded at either Caldbec Hill, Battle Hill, or the Abbey in three phases: The first phase consisted of confrontation, with the Normans striking the Anglo-Saxons first; the second phase is a counter-attack by the English; while the last phrase consisted with a Norman breakthrough. Without the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, there never would have been a Normandy and their duchy formation. In fact, the assimilation of Vikings and their adoption of the French language and customs would have likely occurred in another time, or another manner; if not at all. Nevertheless, these events did happen, and the treaty eventually led to future power struggles between Normandy and England, such as the Norman Conquest. William II, duke of Normandy, became William the I, King of England, when he invaded England at the time of Harold II's reign in 1066. And the Norman Conquest would cause native Anglo-Saxons, Danes, and the like to adopt French into their language which would eventually develop into Middle English.\n\n"}

It is hosted by the World Water Council and takes place every three years.\n\nWorld Water Forum aims to:\n\nThe forum is made up of four primary components:\n\n\nEach of these components benefits from extensive preparatory processes that commence two years prior to the World Water Forum.\n\nPast editions have included other features, such as side events, a learning centre, a children’s forum, a youth forum, a children’s education village, water and film encounters and cultural entertainment.\n\nThe first World Water Forum, following the creation of the World Water Council, took place in Marrakech, Morocco, on 21–23 March 1997. It laid the basis for the development of a long-term “Vision for Water, Life and the Environment in the 21st Century.” Sessions included:\n\nThe 2nd World Water Forum in The Hague in 2000, generated much debate on the World Water Vision and the associated Framework for Action, dealing with the state and ownership of water resources, their development potential, management and financing models, and their impact on poverty, social, cultural and economic development and the environment. The ministerial declaration identified the following key challenges: meeting basic water needs, securing food supply, protecting ecosystems, sharing water resources, managing risks, valuing water and governing water wisely.\n\nThe 3rd World Water Forum, held in Kyoto, Shiga and Osaka, Japan in March 2003, assembled a huge number and variety of stakeholders as compared to previous editions of the forum. In addition, the debate was furthered within the context of the new commitments of meeting the goals set forth at the United Nations in New York (2000), the in Bonn (2001) and the in Johannesburg (2002).\n\nThe 3rd World Water Forum offered 351 sessions under 38 themes. In addition, the \"World Panel on Financing Water Infrastructure\", chaired by Michel Camdessus, presented its conclusions on what should be done to find adequate financing for water infrastructure and offered specific proposals on how this can be achieved, and by whom.\n\nNew concepts were introduced such as a Virtual Water Forum, which consisted of about 166 interactive sessions available through Internet, and the Water Voices Project, where 27,000 opinions of ordinary citizens were collected from 142 countries. The World Water Actions report inventoried over 3,000 local water actions.\n\nThe 3rd World Water Forum also invited the participation of indigenous people, recognizing that indigenous land and water rights is crucial to the discussion of water interests worldwide. Indigenous people have often been excluded from discussions about clean drinking water, water sanitation, and rights to water sources, so this invitation legitimized the rights of indigenous people to help create water related policy. Their participation resulted in the signing of the Indigenous Peoples Kyoto Declaration, which centered on the rights of indigenous people to self determine usage of their own water resources. \n\nDuring the 4th World Water Forum in 2006 in Mexico City, close to 20,000 people from throughout the world participated in 206 working sessions, where a total of 1600 local actions were presented. Participants included official representatives and delegates from 140 countries including 120 mayors and 150 legislators, and 78 ministers. Nearly 1400 journalists were present.\n\nNoteworthy events included:\n\nOver 30,000 participants from 182 countries took part in the 5th World Water Forum, from 16 to 22 March 2009 in Istanbul, Turkey. More than 400 organisations prepared together over 100 sessions organised according to 6 themes, 7 regional reports and 5 high-level panels.\n\nFor the first time in the World Water Forum’s history, a heads of state meeting was organized. In addition, the ministerial statement and water guide were developed through a series of four preparatory meetings of government officials, in which thematic and regional coordinators and representatives of major groups participated. Further exchanges with stakeholder representatives were organized through ministerial roundtable discussions during the 5th World Water Forum.\n\nLocal and regional authorities in attendance produced the Istanbul Water Consensus (IWC), a new compact for local and regional authorities willing to commit to adapting their water infrastructure and services to the emerging challenges they are facing. It was also the first time that over 250 parliamentarians from around the world jointly started to address water issues.\n\nIn addition to the session programme, a number of high-level panels were organized on issues such as water-related disasters, sanitation, the water-food-energy nexus and financing. Following the 5th World Water Forum, the panel on water and climate change continued its efforts to bring forth its recommendations to the UNFCCC process and CoP-15 discussions held in Copenhagen in December 2009.\n\nFor more detailed information on the 5th World Water Forum, a collection of the official outcomes and statements can be found in the Global Water Framework. This compilation presents all the major official documents of the forum: heads of state appeal; ministerial statement; Istanbul Water Guide; ministerial roundtable reports; parliamentarians for water; Istanbul water consensus; compilation of thematic commitments; regional outputs; children’s declaration; and youth declaration.\n\nAnother publication, Water at a Crossroads contains a cross-cutting analysis of the key decisions and major themes addressed at the Forum, including climate change; disasters; water, food and energy; MDGs; finance; public/private management; governance; transboundary issues; the right to water; and data availability.\n\nCivil society protest was considerable, notably about the negative effects of dams. Blockades and marches were organised, and Turkey deported peaceful protesters.\n\nMarseille, France, 2012. There, were, again, extensive protests against the greenwashing of water commodification by corporations and the effects of dams.\n\nThe 7th World Water Forum on the theme of “Water for Our Future” took place from 12 to 17 April 2015 in Daegu and Gyeongbuk, Republic of Korea.\n\nThe 8th World Water Forum took place in Brasilia, Brazil from 18-23 March 2018, the first one in South America\n\nThe 9th edition of the World Water Forum will be held for the first time in sub-Saharan Africa. The 9th World Water Forumwill take place in Dakar, Senegal\n\nTwo water-related Prizes have been awarded during successive World Water Forums: The King Hassan II Great World Water Prize and the Kyoto World Water Grand Prize. Two additional prizes were awarded during the 5th World Water Forum in Istanbul: the Turkish Republic Prime Minister's Water Prize and the Compromiso México Water Prize.\n\n"}
