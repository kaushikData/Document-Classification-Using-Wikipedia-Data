As a pilot, he was part of the tradition of \"exhibition\" pilots, travelling throughout countrysides and entertaining with their aeronautical feats.\n\nOn August 6, 1914, Thompson set the flight altitude record by flying to a height of over Overland Park, Kansas in his Day-Gyro plane. Because of the coldness at that altitude, he wore a sheepskin suit. When the plane ran out of fuel, he executed a spiral glide maneuver to return to earth. This feat, which placed him at the altitude of modern turboprop planes, happened only 10 years after the Wright brothers' first flight. However, because of the advances in flight technology, the record did not last long.\n\nIn 1916, during the run-up to American involvement in World War I, he tried to raise American awareness of the aerial warfare and to encourage greater protections for the East Coast, by launching pyrotechnics over Washington, D.C. . He dropped packets reading, \"This 'Bomb' is Harmless. Suppose it had contained Nitro-Glycerine and was hurled by the \"enemy\" instead of by DeLloyd Thompson, who flies the American Flag? WAKE UP AND PREPARE\"\n\nThat same year, he broke the air speed record over Long Island by traveling 108.4 mph. He was the second American to loop an airplane. He invented the undertaker's drop, a famous airplane maneuver. He was the second aviator in the world to sky-write with an airplane.\n\nIn 1937, developed and constructed the DeLloydCabinaire, a 2 seat monoplane, but that venture failed, due in part to the continuing Great Depression, and only 2 were ever built. That year, his last flight was a demonstration of that plane.\n\nFollowing his aeronautical career, he made an unsuccessful bid to become mayor of Washington, Pennsylvania in 1939. He also became the owner of a coal mine and worked as a construction contractor He was in an automobile accident on U.S. Route 40 in Pennsylvania 1945. He died in Washington 1949 from heart failure.\nOn July 13, 1949, the DeLoyd Thompson Memorial Gates were dedicated at the Washington County Airport. The event, which was attended by 5,000, was marked with an airshow conducted by the Early Birds of Aviation.\n\nEventually, the grounds of the airport outgrew the gates. In 1969, the plates from the gate were refurbished and airport administration building. However, the plates were removed from the grounds, and were at risk of being sold for scrap before being rescued by Margaret Thompson, DeLoyd's daughter-in-law. They eventually were placed in the custody of the Washington County Historical Society at the F. Julius LeMoyne House. In 2013 and 2014, Clay Kilgore, executive director of the Washington County Historical Society, led an effort to restore the plaques to the airport.\n\n\n"}

Monaco, situated on the French coast of the Mediterranean Sea, is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate.\n\nThe Principality has successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service.\n\nThough official economic statistics are not published, year 2011 estimates place the national product at $5.748 billion and the per capita income at $188,409. The unemployment rate is 2%, as of 2012.\n\nLiving standards are high and roughly comparable to those in the prosperous French metropolitan areas. Monaco does not publish national income figures; the estimates below are extremely rough.\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the rail link to France and a casino. Monaco's economy is now primarily geared toward finance, commerce, and tourism.\n\nLow taxes have drawn many foreign companies to Monaco and account for around 75% of the $5.748 billion annual GDP income in (2011). Similarly, tourism accounts for close to 15% of the annual revenue, as the Principality of Monaco also has been a major center for tourism ever since the famed Monte Carlo Casino, which was established in 1856. The casino is alluded to in the ABBA song \"Money, Money, Money\".\n\nFinancial and insurance activities, along with scientific and technical activities are main contributors to GDP of Monaco. Banking sector of Monaco is rather large: in 2015 consolidated banking assets 8.42 times exceeded the country's GDP. Banks operating in Monaco traditionally specialize in private banking, asset and wealth management services.\n\nAn economic and customs union with France governs customs, postal services, telecommunications, and banking in Monaco. Before the euro, Monaco used the French franc. Now part of the Eurozone, but not the EU, Monaco mints its own euro coins.\n\nAll residents pay tax in the form of 19.6% value-added tax on all goods and services.\n\nMonaco is noted for its activity in the field of marine sciences. Its Oceanographic Museum, formerly directed by Jacques-Yves Cousteau, is one of the most renowned institutions of its kind in the world. Monaco imports and exports products and services from all over the world. There is no commercial agriculture in Monaco; it is 100% urban.\n\nMonaco levies no income tax on individuals. The absence of a personal income tax in the principality, has attracted to it a considerable number of wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco; celebrities such as Formula One drivers attract most of the attention, but the vast majority of them are less well-known business people.\n\nIn 2000, a report by the French parliamentarians, Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon, alleged that Monaco had lax policies with respect to money laundering, including within its famed casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary so that alleged crimes were not properly investigated.\n\nIn 1998, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued a first report on the consequences of the tax havens' financial systems. Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in its last report, as well as Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia and the Marshall Islands, underlining its lack of co-operation as regards to financial information disclosure and availability.\n\nIn 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\" The Principality is no longer blamed in the 2005 FATF report, as well as all other territories. However, since 2003, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven.\n\nThe Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco is the only territory that refuses to perform the second round, initially forecast between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories are implementing the third and last round, planned between 2005 and 2007.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36754865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36754865", "title": "External association", "text": "External association\n\nExternal association was a hypothetical relationship between Ireland and the British Commonwealth proposed by Éamon de Valera in 1921–22, whereby Ireland would be a sovereign state associated with, but not a member of, the Commonwealth; the British monarch would be head of the association, but not head of state of Ireland. De Valera proposed external association as a compromise between isolationist Irish republicanism on the one hand and Dominion status on the other. Whereas a full republic could not be a member of the Commonwealth until the London Declaration of 1949, a Dominion could not be fully independent until the Statute of Westminster 1931.\n\nExternal association was never implemented as such; however, de Valera's 1930s diplomacy reflected similar ideas, as did the Commonwealth's London Declaration.\n\nTroy D. Davis suggests de Valera's thinking on external association was influenced, during his tour of the United States in 1919–20, by the US Sugar Intervention in Cuba. Nicholas Mansergh traces the first reference to \"external association\" to 27 July 1921, preceding a proposal by de Valera on 10 August for a treaty of free association between the Irish Republic and Great Britain. De Valera told Mansergh in 1965 that the idea of external association came to him \"one morning as he was tying his bootlaces\", shortly after Jan Smuts' exploratory visit following the June 1921 ceasefire which ended the Anglo-Irish War (later called the Irish War of Independence). In September 1921, David Lloyd George, the UK prime minister, proposed negotiations into \"how the association of Ireland with the community of nations known as the British Empire may best be reconciled with Irish national aspirations\". De Valera accepted and explained his concept of external association to the plenipotentiaries sent to London. Their head, Arthur Griffith, later said de Valera told him the idea was to get out of the \"straitjacket of the Republic\" while \"bringing Cathal along\", referring to Cathal Brugha, the staunchest republican in the Dáil ministry.\n\nThe British ministers negotiating with the Irish plenipotentiaries rejected the idea of external association, and the Anglo-Irish Treaty the two sides signed on 6 December 1921 provided for an Irish Free State with the same status as the Dominion of Canada. De Valera opposed this, and in the Second Dáil debate on the Treaty offered his alternative \"Document No. 2\", of which articles 2 to 6 described the \"Terms of Association\":\n\n\nDe Valera, a former mathematics teacher, used Venn diagrams and other graphs to illustrate the relationships he envisaged between Ireland and the Commonwealth. Commentators have suggested the putative virtues of his proposal were too subtle and abstract to appeal to either supporters of the Treaty or republicans opposed to it. A journalist reporting on the Dáil debate said of de Valera's presentation, \"One felt, however, we were entering the region of pure casuistry, nebulous, unpalpable and unreal.\"\n\nThe Dáil voted to accept the original Treaty, and de Valera resigned as President of Dáil Éireann. In the Irish Civil War, he was nominal leader of the anti-Treaty side, although the military force was led by republicans who regarded external association as an unacceptable compromise. In June 1922, UK prime minister David Lloyd George sought clarification from the pro-Treaty Provisional Government that was drafting the Constitution of the Irish Free State; one question was:\nArthur Griffith's answer was:\n\nThe pro-Treaty Cumann na nGaedheal party formed the Executive Council of the Irish Free State until 1932 and participated in the Commonwealth's Imperial Conferences.\n\nDe Valera's Fianna Fáil party, founded in 1926, came to power in the Free State after the 1932 general election and proceeded to eliminate many of the symbols of the state's Dominion status, including the Oath of Allegiance and appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Although this implicitly abrogated the 1921 Treaty, the Privy Council ruled in 1935 that the Statute of Westminster 1931 empowered the Free State government to do so.\n\nThe Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936 abolished the office of Governor-General and removed all references to the monarch from the constitution, with most functions reassigned to the Executive Council. However, the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936, passed immediately afterwards, effected that the king continued to be head of state for external purposes, including treaties and accrediting diplomats. In 1937, a new constitution came into effect. This made no mention of the British Commonwealth or monarchy, and established the office of President of Ireland with many of the internal functions of a head of state, including precedence, pardon, signing laws, and appointing ministers, judges, and military officers. Nevertheless, the External Relations Act remained in force by virtue of the Constitution's allusion to the British monarch in Article 29.4.2°:\n\nCommentators have compared this situation, where the President was the de facto internal head of state while the King was the de jure external head of state, with de Valera's 1920s external association proposal. While he had made \"a republic in all but name\", De Valera avoided explicitly declaring a republic, which he believed would alienate the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland and thus entrench Partition. Ireland took no part in Commonwealth business; whether it remained a member of the Commonwealth or merely associated with it was a moot point. De Valera told the Dáil in 1945:\nBy contrast, Nicholas Mansergh wrote in 1948, \"External association has never been put into practice because the United Kingdom and the oversea dominions have never recognized that it exists.\"\n\nFianna Fáil lost power in 1948, and the Inter-Party Government's Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force in 1949, repealed the External Relations Act and declared the Irish state to be a republic, implicitly leaving the Commonwealth. With the prospect of newly independent India also declaring a republic, the Commonwealth leaders agreed in the London Declaration of 28 April 1949 that republics could be members of the Commonwealth, while the British monarch would remain Head of the Commonwealth. The situation where the monarch was head of the association but not necessarily of its members has been compared to de Valera's external association.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11448", "title": "Federated States of Micronesia", "text": "Federated States of Micronesia\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia (; abbreviated FSM and also known simply as Micronesia) is an independent republic associated to the United States. It consists of four states from west to east, Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosraethat are spread across the Western Pacific Ocean. Together, the states comprise around 607 islands (a combined land area of approximately ) that cover a longitudinal distance of almost just north of the equator. They lie northeast of New Guinea, south of Guam and the Marianas, west of Nauru and the Marshall Islands, east of Palau and the Philippines, about north of eastern Australia and some southwest of the main islands of Hawaii.\n\nWhile the FSM's total land area is quite small, it occupies more than of the Pacific Ocean, giving the country the 14th largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world. The independent sovereign island nations capital is Palikir, located on Pohnpei Island, while the largest city is Weno, located in the Chuuk Atoll.\n\nEach of its four states is centered on one or more main high islands, and all but Kosrae include numerous outlying atolls. The Federated States of Micronesia is spread across part of the Caroline Islands in the wider region of Micronesia, which consists of thousands of small islands divided among several countries. The term \"Micronesia\" may refer to the Federated States or to the region as a whole.\n\nThe FSM was formerly a part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI), a United Nations Trust Territory under U.S. administration, but it formed its own constitutional government on May 10, 1979, becoming a sovereign state after independence was attained on November 3, 1986 under a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Other neighboring island entities, and also former members of the TTPI, formulated their own constitutional governments and became the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and the Republic of Palau (ROP). The FSM has a seat in the United Nations.\n\nThe ancestors of the Micronesians settled over four thousand years ago. A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on Yap Island.\n\nNan Madol, consisting of a series of small artificial islands linked by a network of canals, is often called the Venice of the Pacific. It is located on the eastern periphery of the island of Pohnpei and used to be the ceremonial and political seat of the Saudeleur dynasty that united Pohnpei's estimated 25,000 people from about AD 500 until 1500, when the centralized system collapsed.\n\nEuropean explorers—first the Portuguese in search of the Spice Islands (Indonesia) and then the Spanish—reached the Carolines in the sixteenth century. The Spanish incorporated the archipelago to the Spanish East Indies through the capital, Manila, and in the 19th century established a number of outposts and missions. In 1887, they founded the town of \"Santiago de la Ascension\" in what today is Kolonia on the island of Pohnpei.\n\nFollowing defeat in the Spanish–American War, the Spanish sold the archipelago to Germany in 1899 under the German–Spanish Treaty of 1899. Germany incorporated it into German New Guinea.\n\nDuring World War I, it was captured by Japan. Following the war, the League of Nations awarded a mandate for Japan to administer the islands as part of the South Pacific Mandate.\n\nDuring World War II, a significant portion of the Japanese fleet was based in Truk Lagoon. In February 1944, Operation Hailstone, one of the most important naval battles of the war, took place at Truk, in which many Japanese support vessels and aircraft were destroyed.\n\nFollowing World War II, it was administered by the United States under United Nations auspices in 1947 as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands pursuant to Security Council Resolution 21.\n\nOn May 10, 1979, four of the Trust Territory districts ratified a new constitution to become the Federated States of Micronesia. Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands chose not to participate. The FSM signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States, which entered into force on November 3, 1986, marking Micronesia's emergence from trusteeship to independence. Independence was formally concluded under international law in 1990, when the United Nations officially ended the Trusteeship status pursuant to Security Council Resolution 683. The Compact was renewed in 2004.\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is governed by the 1979 constitution, which guarantees fundamental human rights and establishes a separation of governmental powers. The unicameral Congress has fourteen members elected by popular vote. Four senators—one from each state—serve four-year terms; the remaining ten senators represent single-member districts based on population, and serve two-year terms. The President and Vice President are elected by Congress from among the four state-based senators to serve four-year terms in the executive branch. Their congressional seats are then filled by special elections.\n\nThe president and vice president are supported by an appointed cabinet. There are no formal political parties.\n\nIn international politics, the Federated States of Micronesia has often voted with the United States with respect to United Nations General Assembly resolutions.\n\nThe FSM is a sovereign, self-governing state in free association with the United States of America, which is wholly responsible for its defense. The Division of Maritime Surveillance operates a paramilitary Maritime Wing and a small Maritime Police Unit. The Compact of Free Association allows FSM citizens to join the U.S. military without having to obtain U.S. permanent residency or citizenship, allows for immigration and employment for Micronesians in the U.S., and establishes economic and technical aid programs.\n\nFSM has foreign relations with 56 countries, including the Holy See. FSM was admitted to the United Nations based on the Security Council's recommendation on August 9, 1991 in Resolution 703 and the General Assembly's approval on September 17, 1991 in Resolution 46/2. The FSM is an active member of the Pacific Islands Forum.\n\nThe four states in the federation are, from west to east:\nThese states are further divided into municipalities.\n\nSpain has a claim to sovereignty over a few islands including Kapingamarangi in Pohnpei State. A commission of cardinals under Pope Leo XIII arbitrated a dispute for the Caroline Islands and others extending from the Equator to 11°N Latitude and from 133°E to 164°E Longitude. Germany and Spain on 17 December 1885 agreed in a treaty that they were a part of the Spanish East Indies. In 1899, Spain sold \"las Carolinas\" to Germany. Kapingamarangi is far south of the Carolines and the people are racially and culturally Polynesian, not Micronesian or Carolinian. In 1948, Emilio Pastor Santos of the Spanish National Research Council found that the charts and maps up to 1899 had shown that Kapingamarangi and a few other islands had never been considered part of the Carolines, were not included in the description of the territory transferred to Germany and were never ceded by Spain; therefore, Spain retained sovereignty. In 1949, the Cabinet of Diplomatic Information of the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following declaration:\n\"... The Ministry recognises that it is a certain fact and historic truth due to Article 3 of the Treaty of July 1, 1899, that Spain reserved a series of rights in Micronesia and for another thing, the specifications of the territories which Spain ceded in 1899 leaves apart certain groups of islands in the same zone.\"\nSuccessive Spanish governments have not abandoned Spain's sovereignty, or insisted on enforcing it, or recognized the sovereignty of the Federated States of Micronesia over Kapingamarangi. The Federated States of Micronesia claims sovereignty and has de facto control of the island.\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia consists of 607 islands extending across the archipelago of the Caroline Islands east of the Philippines. The islands have a combined area of .\n\nThe islands are grouped into four states, which are Yap, Chuuk (called Truk until January 1990), Pohnpei (known as \"Ponape\" until November 1984), and Kosrae (formerly Kusaie). These four states are each represented by a white star on the national flag. The capital is Palikir, on Pohnpei.\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is served by four international airports.\n\nEconomic activity in the Federated States of Micronesia consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. Long line fishing of tuna is also viable with foreign vessels from China that operated in the 1990s. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development. Financial assistance from the U.S. is the primary source of revenue, with the U.S. pledged to spend $1.3 billion in the islands in 1986–2001; the CIA World Factbook lists high dependence on U.S. aid as one of the main concerns of the FSM. Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term growth.\n\nThe indigenous population of the nation, which is predominantly Micronesian, consists of various ethnolinguistic groups. It has a nearly 100% Pacific Islander and Asian population: Chuukese 48.8%, Pohnpeian 24.2%, Kosraean 6.2%, Yapese 5.2%, Yap outer islands 4.5%, Asian 1.8%, Polynesian 1.5%, other 6.4%, unknown 1.4%. A sizeable minority also have some Japanese ancestry, which is a result of intermarriages between Japanese settlers and Micronesians during the Japanese colonial period.\n\nThere is also a growing expatriate population of Americans, Australians, Europeans, and residents from China and the Philippines since the 1990s. English has become the common language of the government, and for secondary and tertiary education. Outside of the main capital towns of the four FSM states, the local languages are primarily spoken. Population growth remains high at more than 3% annually, offset somewhat by net emigration.\n\nEnglish is the official and common language. Also spoken are Chuukese, Kosraean, Pohnpeian, Yapese, Ulithian, Woleaian, Nukuoro, and Kapingamarangi.\n\nOther languages spoken in the country include Pingelapese, Ngatikese, Satawalese, Puluwatese, Mortlockese, and Mokilese. There are about 3,000 speakers of Kapingamarangi and Ulithian, and under 1,000 speakers of Nukuoro.\n\nMost Micronesians are Christian. Several Protestant denominations, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, are present in every Micronesian state. Most Protestant groups trace their roots to American Congregationalist missionaries. On the island of Kosrae, the population is approximately 7,800; 95 percent are Protestants. On Pohnpei, the population of 35,000 is evenly divided between Protestants and Catholics. Most immigrants are Filipino Catholics who have joined local Catholic churches, e.g. Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church in Pohnpei. \n\nOn Chuuk and Yap, an estimated 60 percent are Catholic and 40 percent are Protestant. Religious groups with small followings include Baptists, Assemblies of God, Salvation Army, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and the Bahá'í Faith. There is a small group of Buddhists on Pohnpei, and a small group of Ahmadiyya Muslims in Kosrae. Attendance at religious services is generally high; churches are well supported by their congregations and play a significant role in civil society.\n\nSee Health in the Federated States of Micronesia\n\nThe sport of football in the Federated States of Micronesia is run by the Federated States of Micronesia Football Association. They control the Micronesian games, the nation's football championship and the Micronesia National Football Team.\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia Athletic Association is the governing body for the country's sports and athletics.\n\nEach of the four states has its own culture and traditions, but there are also common cultural and economic bonds that are centuries old. Cultural similarities include the importance of the traditional extended family and clan systems and are found on all the islands.\n\nThe island of Yap is notable for its \"stone money\" (Rai stones), large disks usually of calcite, up to in diameter, with a hole in the middle. The islanders, aware of the owner of a piece, do not necessarily move them when ownership changes. There are five major types: \"Mmbul\", \"Gaw\", \"Ray\", \"Yar\", and \"Reng\", the last being only in diameter. Their value is based on both size and history, many of them having been brought from other islands, as far as New Guinea, but most coming in ancient times from Palau. Approximately 6,500 of them are scattered around the island.\n\nPohnpei is home to \"Nan Madol: Ceremonial Centre of Eastern Micronesia\", a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but the site is currently listed as \"In Danger\" due to natural causes. The government is working on the conservation of the site.\n\nThere have been very few published literary writers from the Federated States of Micronesia. In 2008, Emelihter Kihleng became the first ever Micronesian to publish a collection of poetry in the English language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

To keep listeners on their toes, random topics are picked from a big \"Bag O Topics.\"\n\nPodcasts of all previous shows are available on the show's website so that previous shows can be listened to again. Previous shows can also be found on iTunes.\n\nThe show runs interviews with regular and/or rotating guests, dealing with subjects of both local interest and of general interest to the expatriate community. The first person to be interviewed on the show was the illustrious English painter, interior designer and writer, Stella Wulf. Stella is the author of \"The Lonesome Froom and other Strange Tales,\" \"Rum Rhymes and Vagabond\" and \"The Song of the Froom.\" She recounted humorous stories of her years in France and her efforts to get her books published.\n\nSubsequent interviews included music industry notaries such as Joy Askew and her brother Roger Askew. These two truly multi-dimensional singers sang some of their favourite songs on air. Joy, who worked closely with the likes of Peter Gabriel and Joe Jackson, and fronted the all-girl rock band called Bitch, told her story of life as a song-writer and touring musician. The interview proved enormously popular with both English and French speaking listeners in France and it served to create a pattern of story telling and musical treats that would become an underlying trait of later interviews.\n\nA highly commended interview was that with Leaf Fielding, one of the drug-dealers jailed as a result of the famous 1977 drug cartel bust in the UK called Operation Julie. The interview revolved around Leaf's life, his descent into drug dealing, his imprisonment, and his new life in France. Also discussed was Leaf’s book \"To Live Outside The Law\", that tells the story from his early days and his first experience with LSD, to his amazing falling from grace.\n\nThe show relies heavily on e-mailed material sent in by listeners that is then read out on air, and most of the regular contributors are local expatriates living in the Gascony region.\n\n"}

They have been classified into a number of groups according to transmission code and frequency, and it is supposed that the source for most of them is Russia.\n\nLetter beacons have been referred to as:\n\nThese radio transmissions were discovered in the late 1960s. Their presence became known to the wider amateur radio community in 1978, when beacon “W” started transmitting on 3584 kHz, in the 80 meters band. There is indirect evidence that this particular transmitter was located in Cuba.\n\nIn 1982 there were also reports, supposedly based on HF direction finding by the US military, that beacon “K” transmitting on 9043 kHz was located at , near the city of Khabarovsk in the USSR. A few years later, it was suggested that the “K” beacons were actually located at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula and the “U” beacons were located at the Barents Sea coast, between Murmansk and Amderma.\n\nAccording to D.W. Schimmel, in 1986 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released the following HF direction finding results for single letter beacons, all of which indicate locations in the USSR:\n\nThe link with the USSR and, more recently, Russia is further supported by the existence of single letter beacons transmitting letters existing only in the Cyrillic Morse code alphabet.\n\nThe ENIGMA group also accepted these locations for cluster beacons \"C\", \"D\", \"P\" and \"S\", adding Vladivostok for beacon \"F\".\n\nA recent source (2006) regarding locations was published on the Web by Ary Boender. This publication also contains an extensive list of letter beacon frequencies, both current and historical. The following locations are given for cluster beacons:\n\nFor solitary beacons and markers, Boender suggests these locations:\n\nTransmissions of the \"P\" beacon in December 2007, even on medium frequency (420 and 583 kHz), suggest the Russian naval base at Kaliningrad as a possible source. Kaliningrad officially uses the ITU registered call sign \"RMP\".\n\nThe single letter beacons can be classified into two groups, \"cluster beacons\" and \"channel markers\". A beacon \"P\" exists in both groups. A third group, called FSK beacons, is now extinct. The following sections list the beacons currently (December 2007) active, according to published listeners’ reports.\n\nA group of radio beacons with single-letter identifiers (\"C\", \"D\", \"M\", \"S\", \"P\", \"A\", \"M\" and \"K\") have been regularly reported near 3594, 4558, 5154, 7039, 8495, 10872, 13528, 16332 and 20048 kHz. The term \"cluster beacons\" is frequently used for them, as they transmit in parallel on frequencies only 0.1 kHz apart. These beacons transmit only their single-letter identifier in standard CW (A1A) using Morse code.\n\nThe following call signs and frequencies of cluster beacons have been reported recently (September 2007 to November 2008) in Numbers&Oddities newsletter, Utility DX Forum and ENIGMA-2000:\n\nOccasionally, some cluster beacons (especially \"F\" and \"M\") have been reported transmitting on frequencies different from their regular channel for short periods.\n\nA second family of letter beacons includes all those operating outside the clusters. For this reason, they are often called \"solitary beacons\" or \"solitaires\". They also transmit their single-letter identifier in standard CW (A1A) using Morse code.\n\nA few solitary beacons, like \"R\" on 4325.9 and 5465.9 kHz, operate exactly like the cluster beacons, sending only their single letter identifier.\n\nHowever, the majority of solitary beacons, most notably \"P\" on various MF and HF frequencies, transmit their single-letter identifier in Morse code. Sometimes the routine transmission is interrupted and brief messages are sent in fast Morse code or in an FSK digital mode. Therefore, a more appropriate term for these beacon-like single-letter transmissions is \"channel markers\", as their purpose is to occupy and identify a particular HF transmission channel when no traffic is transmitted. There is no evidence that the cluster beacon \"P\" and the solitary beacon \"P\" are directly related.\n\nIt was reported in \"Numbers and Oddities\", issue 142, that beacon C on 8000 kHz also transmitted messages under the regular call sign RIW, which is allocated to a Russian naval communication station in Khiva, Uzbekistan.\n\nThere are also a few oddities transmitting signals with poor modulation and irregular timing, like \"V\" on 5342 and 6430.7 kHz.\n\nThe following call signs and frequencies of solitary beacons and markers have been reported recently (September 2007 to September 2009) in Numbers&Oddities newsletter, Utility DX Forum and ENIGMA-2000:\n\nThis group includes the \"K\" and \"U\" beacons, which are no longer active. They transmitted their Morse code single letter identification by shifting the frequency of the carrier by approximately 1000 Hz. This mode of \"FSK-CW\" is designated F1A. The use of FSK indicated that the transmitter was suitable for FSK data transmissions, like radioteletype.\n\nENIGMA devised a naming scheme for all stations in their sphere of interest. In the original scheme, the following identifications were issued to letter beacons:\n\nENIGMA-2000, the Internet-based ENIGMA successor group, revised the original ENIGMA designators. The current designations for letter beacons are the following (since 2007):\n\nThe purpose of the letter beacons is not yet known with certainty. Many theories have appeared in specialized publications, but none is based on documentary evidence. They have been postulated to be radio propagation beacons, channel markers, or beacons used in tracking satellites or for civil defense purposes. Some stations of this family, in particular the “U” beacon, have been implicated in deliberate jamming.\n\nAccording to ENIGMA, cluster beacons are used by the Russian navy (especially its submarine branch) to find the most suitable radio frequency for contact based on current radio propagation conditions.\n\nRobert Connolly also links \"P\" channel marker with communications facilities at the Russian naval base of Kaliningrad. \"P\" transmissions carrying Russian navy \"XXX\" (flash priority) Morse code messages with call signs \"RPM\" and \"RDL\" further support this view.\n\nA few aero navigation non-directional beacons also transmit single letter identification codes. They can be easily distinguished from letter beacons because they transmit in the allocated low frequency and medium frequency bands; most of them are listed in appropriate aviation handbooks and their transmission mode is A2A (full carrier with audio modulation).\n\n\n\n"}

In 2014, China produced and consumed more than 30% of cigarettes total in the world. There is a strong relationship between SES and smoking behaviors. According to the research, developing countries having the most tobacco use. In other words, the higher the level of SES the more smokers. “China was found to be one of the countries with the highest male-to-female ratio of smoking prevalence,” which 74% of males and 8% of females were smokers. \nSmokers are over half of adult males in Indonesia (57%, but mostly kretek, a local form of cigarette) and China (53% estimated), and nearly half in Bangladesh, though for women the figure is much lower.\n\nSmoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006 falling from 42% to 20.8% of adults, with further significant decline to 18% by 2012. \nThere are large regional differences in smoking rates, with Kentucky, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Mississippi topping the list, and Idaho, California and Utah at significantly lower rates.\n\nIn Australia the incidence of smoking is in decline, with figures from 2014–15 showing 14.7% of the population (over 18) to be daily smokers, a decline from 22.3% in 2001. \nYoung adults are the most likely age group to smoke, with a marked decline in smoking rates with increasing age.\nThe prevalence of smoking is strongly associated with socioeconomic disadvantage [low earners], with over double the rate in the most disadvantaged quintile of the population as compared to the least. \nSmoking rates in rural areas tend to be higher than in city areas.\n\nThe worldwide average is 1083 cigarettes per year per person above age 14 according to the same source.\n\n\n"}
