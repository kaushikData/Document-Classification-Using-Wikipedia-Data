In the era of the Pyu city-states it was a city of considerable significance, possibly a local capital replacing Sri Ksetra. Today the modest village is noted for its hot springs and archaeological sites. Beikthano, Hanlin, and Sri Ksetra, the ancient cities of the Pyu Kingdom were built on the irrigated fields of the dry zone of the Ayeyawady River basin. They were inscribed by UNESCO on its List of World Heritage Sites in Southeast Asia in May 2014 for their archaeological heritage traced back more than 1,000 years to between 200 BC and 900 AD. \n\nBeikthano with direct land access to the well-watered Kyaukse plains to its northeast, is the oldest urban site so far discovered and scientifically excavated site. Its remains—the structures, pottery, artefacts, and human skeletons—date from 200 BCE to 100 CE. Named after the Hindu god Vishnu, the city may be the first capital of a culturally and perhaps even politically uniform state in the history of Burma. It was a large fortified settlement, measuring approximately 300 hectares inside the rectangular (3 km by 1 km) walls. The walls and fortifications along it measured six meters thick, and are radiocarbon dated to a period between 180 BCE and 610 CE. Like most subsequent cities, the main entrance of the walls led to the palace, which faced east. Stupas and monastic buildings have also been excavated within the city walls.\n\nBeikthano is traditionally believed to have been founded some 2,400 years ago by Princess Pan Htwar descended from a still legendary dynasty of Tagaung in Upper Myanmar. The fall of the city is attributed to a mightier king, Duttabaung of Sri Ksetra, who sacked the city, subdued the princess, took her captive and eventually married her. In the present stage of historical research in this country the personalities characterized in the legend are beyond authentic identification. However, the existence of an ancient city called Beikthano (Vishnu City) is testified by the ruins which stand to this day and indicates that the legend may have sprung up from a nucleus of true facts.\n\nIn October 1996, Beikthano, Hanlin and Sri Ksetra were proposed to be inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. This proposal was approved by UNESCO in the 38th session of the World Heritage Committee held in May 2014 in Doha, Qatar. According to the UNESCO report, the Pyu Kingdom prospered for over 1,000 years between 200 BC and 900 AD. All three sites are inscribed under Criterion (ii), (iii), and (iv) covering an area of with a buffer zone of . The integrity assessment by UNESCO of the three sites is: \"The completeness and reliability of dated archaeological sequences from the site, with the radiocarbon dates derived from intact architectural features dating back to 190 BCE, provide scientific proof of the entire one-thousand year period of occupation of the cities, and reinforces palaeographic dates provided by inscriptions in Pyu script on artifacts excavated at the site\"\n\n"}

For foreign tourists to visit the zone a permit issued by the local FSB department is required.\n\nThe restricted access zone (of width generally, but e.g., running as much as deep along the Estonian border) was established in the Soviet Union in 1934, and later expanded, at times including vast territories. In 1935–1936, in order to secure the western border of the Soviet Union, many nationalities considered unreliable (Poles, Germans, Ingrian Finns, Estonians, Latvians) were forcibly transferred from the zone by forces of NKVD.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the borders of the new Russian Federation were dramatically different, but the zone was not corrected accordingly and hence effectively ceased to exist. In 1993, the Law on the State Border was adopted and reestablished a border strip with restricted access, which should not exceed (although in fact it became much wider in some places). In 2004 the law was amended, the 5 km restriction was removed, and the FSB was legally authorized to draw the zone's limits on its own without coordination with local authorities. In 2006 FSB Director Nikolay Patrushev and his deputy Sergei Smirnov issued decrees delimiting the zone, which expanded greatly and included many large settlements, important transport routes and resort areas, especially in the Republic of Karelia, Leningrad Oblast, and Primorsky Krai. In 2007, pressured by the public, FSB curtailed the zone in some places.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26872506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26872506", "title": "Carta Pisana", "text": "Carta Pisana\n\nThe Carta Pisana is a map probably made at the end of the 13th century, about 1275-1300. New research suggests that it was made a century later. It was found in Pisa, hence its name. It shows the whole Mediterranean, the Black Sea and a part of the atlantic coast, from the north of present-day Morocco (down to roughly the 33rd parallel north, with the town of Azemmour) to the present-day Netherlands, but the accuracy of the map is mostly limited to the Mediterranean. It is the oldest surviving nautical chart (that is, not simply a map but a document showing accurate navigational directions). It is a portolan chart, showing a detailed survey of the coasts, and many ports, but bears no indication on the topography or toponymy of the inland. On the map, North is on the top, in contrast to other maps of the same period such as the Hereford Mappa Mundi (ca. 1300), where East is on the top.\n\nPossible places of origin for the map include Pisa, where it was found, Venetia, and Genoa, which is the conventionally recognised place of origin. The density of the ports referenced on the map is the highest for the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the lowest for that of the Ionian Sea. This is possible evidence that the map is of genoese origin, since Genoa, at this time, was a major power in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Additionally, the first textual reference to the use of such a detailed maritime chart, in 1270, is in relation to a Genoese ship.\n\nThe inaccuracy of the Atlantic part of the \"Carta Pisana\", especially when compared to its Mediterranean part, can be exemplified by its depiction of Great Britain: an irregular, rectangular shape, lying on an east–west axis. Only six place names are indicated for Great Britain. \"Civitate Londra\" (London) is placed in the middle of the southern coast.\n\nAs to the date of the map, it is partly indicated by the mention of the town of Manfredonia, which was founded by king Manfred of Sicily in 1256.\n\nThe sources used in the making of the \"Carta Pisana\" are difficult to determine. The use of several dialects in the place-names indicated on the map would tend to suggest that several regional sources were compiled to make the map. Other possibilities include a hypothetical earlier, no longer extant portolan chart, or Ancient Roman cartography. However, there is absolutely no evidence supporting the existence of an earlier portolan chart, and the fact that the map's most glaring error concerns Italy would undermine the theory of an Ancient Roman influence.\n\nThe map encompasses almost all of the Mediterranean inside two circles, one for the western Mediterranean, one for the eastern. These circles are divided into sixteen parts, providing the map with sixteen corresponding wind directions. Furthermore, it comprises a two-directional scale subdivised into several segments corresponding to 200, 50, 10, and 5 miles. The exact value of these \"portolan miles\" is difficult to calculate in present-day units, given discrepancies between geographical areas on this map and others; but it is conventionally accepted to be around 1.25 kilometers.\n\n"}

The group was composed of seven states led by radical, left-wing leaders largely from North Africa - Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, Libya, Mali, and Morocco. The conflict and eventual compromise between the Casablanca Group and the Monrovia Group lead to the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity.\n\nThe group first met in 1961 in the Moroccan port city of Casablanca, hence the alliance's name. This conference brought together some of the continent's most prominent statesmen like Gamal Abdel-Nasser of Egypt, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Sékou Touré of Guinea.\n\nWhat united them was a belief in the need for African political unification or federation. They believed that only significant, deep integration, as has since occurred in Europe through the European Union, would enable Africa to defeat colonialism, achieve peace, foster cultural dialogue, increase the continent's geopolitical influence and promote economic development. In other words, they believed in the transfer of many powers from national governments to a supranational, pan-African authority. Nkrumah even argued for the establishment of a pan-African army which could be deployed to fight colonialism or white minority rule across the continent. His famous Pan-Africanist slogan was 'Africa Must Unite!'\n\nHowever, the Casablanca Group was ultimately unsuccessful. Most other African leaders did not support such radical change. The ideas of its rival, the so-called Monrovia Group - which also believed in Pan-Africanism but not at the expense of nationalism and independent statehood - prevailed. In 1963, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was established. All the members of both the Casablanca and Monrovia groups joined, putting their differences to one side. The OAU, now the African Union, has only achieved limited integration and unity of its member states. It is a reflection of the values of the Monrovia Group and a repudiation of the ideas of the Casablanca Group.\n\nAs well as disagreeing on the nature of African unity, the groups also took up conflicting positions on the then conflicts in Algeria and Congo. While the Casablanca Group's members pledged to support the Front de Liberation Nationale in its efforts fighting for Algerian independence from France, the Monrovia Group backed their enemies, the French.\n\n"}

For the protection of the French and British citizens in New Hebrides, a joint naval commission was established under the Convention of 16 October 1887. However, the convention claimed no jurisdiction over internal native affairs.\n\nThe lack of a functional government led to rising discontent among the colonists. The French were especially inconvenienced because French law only recognized marriages when contracted under a civil authority (the nearest one being in New Caledonia), whereas British law recognized marriages conducted by local clergy. On 9 August 1889, Franceville declared itself an independent commune under the leadership of elected mayor/president Ferdinand-Albert Chevillard, and with its own red, white and blue flag with five stars.\n\nThis community became one of the first self-governing nations in recorded history to practice universal suffrage without distinction of sex or race. Although the district's population at the time consisted of about 500 natives and fewer than 50 whites, only white males were permitted to hold office. One of its elected presidents was R. D.

It has been characterized as the collective response of African states to the World Bank's 1981 Berg report. The plan blamed Africa's economic crisis on the Structural Adjustment Programs of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and the vulnerability of African economies to worldwide economic shocks, such as the 1973 oil crisis.\n\nThe report claimed that development in Africa could be achieved by a decreased reliance on raw material extraction, industrialization, global equality in trade relations and an increase in development aid from the international community. Africanist scholars noted the absence in the report of any blame on, or calls for reform of, domestic governments of Africa. This contrasts significantly with the Berg Report, which apportioned blame solely on the Africa leaders themselves, with the international community taking no responsibility for their part in Africa's demise. \n\n"}

It was established in the displaced persons camps in Germany in 1946 and had an active performance schedule until 1949.\n\nIn 1946 Hryhory Nazarenko together with the Honcharenko brothers left the Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus and started working on establishing a new bandurist capella. This new capella was formed in the British zone in Germany in the city of Goslar and was called the Leontovych Bandurist Capella after the Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych.\n\nThe Capella consisted of some 18 members taught and later directed by Hryhory Nazarenko. They played on diatonic Kharkiv-style banduras with the newly developed mechanisms designed by the Honcharenko brothers. Nazarenko busied himself writing out arrangements and repertoire from the works performed by the Poltava Bandurist Capella teaching Kharkiv-style playing. He coached the choir and taught the members to play the bandura, including many of the technical devices developed by Hnat Khotkevych.\n\nEach of the members required instruments. The Honcharenko brothers set up a workshop in the DP camp where they were made and taught some of the members to make banduras.\n\nThe establishment of the Leontovych Capella was a very successful experiment. In the 1930s Nazarenko was the concertmaster of the Poltava and later Combined Bandurist Capella. In this capacity he also was in charge of the music library often writing on the orchestral parts for all the performers. Because of this, Nazarenko was able to restore from his own memory a number of works by Hnat Khotkevych.\n\nAfter successfully touring Germany with numerous concerts, many of the members joined up with the Ukrainian Bandurist Capella when they emigrated to the United States in 1949. Others migrated to England, South America and Australia where they were able to share their knowledge with the Ukrainian communities established there.\n"}

It includes Japanese manga, American comic books, and European comics. The series are listed according to the highest sales estimates as reported in reliable sources.\n\nThis list includes comic books that have sold least 100million copies. There are three separate lists, for three different comic book publication formats (collected comic book volumes, periodical floppy comic issues, and comic magazines).\n\nThis list is for comics printed in a traditional book format (paperback or hardcover), typically with a similar number of pages as novels. The list includes graphic novels printed exclusively in this format, and trade paperback/hardcover books which compile periodical comic chapters/issues into larger collected volumes. This list includes Japanese manga tankōbon volumes, American trade paperbacks, graphic novels, and European comic albums.\n\nThese comic series were originally serialized either as chapters (typically 15-30 pages each) in comic publications (such as comic magazines) or as single-page comic strips in non-comic publications (such as newspapers), before being collected into a larger comic book volume (which compiles either multiple comic chapters or numerous comic strips). For comic series originally serialized as chapters in comic magazines or manga magazines, their estimated circulation figures in those magazines are given in footnotes.\n\nThis list is for single-issue floppy comics, also known as the American comic book format. Unlike the paperback book format, floppy comics are thinner periodicals and stapled together. Each floppy comic issue is typically 20-40 pages, and usually consists of a single chapter (as opposed to a larger comic book volume that typically includes multiple chapters). A floppy comic is comparable to a comic magazine, but is thinner in size and is dedicated to a single character or group of characters (whereas a comic magazine is thicker and serializes multiple different unrelated series). Floppy comics are the most common publication format for American comics.\nThis list also contains periodical publications from other countries that are similarly dedicated to a single character or group of characters.\n\nThis list is for comic magazines, which are anthology magazines that serialize multiple different unrelated comic series.

In August 2013, SES Platform Services won an international tender by Turner Broadcasting System, starting November 2013, to provide playout for the broadcast channels, Boomerang, Cartoon Network, glitz*, RT, TNT Film and TNT Serie (in both SD and HD) for the German-speaking market, digitization of existing Turner content, and playout for Turner on-demand and catch-up services in Germany, Austria, Switzerland the Benelux region.\n\nOriginally called DPC (Digital Playout Centre GmbH), SES Platform Services was founded in 1996 by Kirch, a German media company.

In June 2004, SES announced that it had bought the controlling interest in DPC from Premiere with the intention of launching an \"open\" pay-TV platform for Germany using Premiere-compatible digital set top boxes.\nIn December 2004, a requirement for regulatory approval from the German Federal Cartels Office (Bundeskartellamt) meant that the deal was changed to 100% of DPC, to give SES sole ownership. DPC was later renamed to ASTRA Platform Services GmbH (APS), and in April 2012 to SES Platform Services.\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced that SES Platform Services had agreed, subject to regulatory approvals, to purchase RR Media, a global digital media services provider to the broadcast and media industries, based in Israel.\n\nThe main services provided to broadcasters by SES Platform Services are Content Management, Playout, Encryption, Distribution and Interactive services.

SES Platform Services uses the DIVArchive digital archiving system from Front Porch Digital with (as of mid 2009), over 1 PB capacity storing tens of thousands of hours of content. New material is added at the rate of about 1000–2000 hours per month. Although SES Platform Services still provides videotape storage, this has reduced by more than half since digital archiving was introduced.\n\nSES Platform Services undertakes the preparation and playout of content from tape or digital files according to the customer's supplied schedule. SES Platform Services provides customers with visual quality control, the incorporation of on-screen branding and graphics (in 2D or 3D), EPG data and expandable services that range from automatic small channel start-up systems to high-end systems with full-time monitoring and support.\n\nWhere needed, interactive services can also be provided to broadcasters, including HbbTV (Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV). SES Platform Services also designs and develops broadcasters’ web pages, and has developed the Blucom interactive TV-service that combines broadcasting and mobile technologies to offer services such as programme announcements, weather, lottery and sports results, and further programme information. Blucom enables interaction such as voting, downloads, chats, and advertising. It also gives mobile phones the ability to stream live TV broadcasts. Blucom synchronizes TV content with the additional information in real-time. Content is sent to a set-top box via satellite, then to a mobile phone via Bluetooth, or directly to the mobile phone via UMTS/GPRS. The return channel operates from the viewer’s mobile via SMS or UMTS/GPRS.\n\nFor pay-TV broadcasts, SES Platform Services provides channel encryption for subscription and pay-per-view protection with Conax, Cryptoworks, Irdeto, Nagravision, and NDS conditional access systems using DVB simulcrypt operation for broadcasts using multiple conditional access systems in parallel, this being a common practice in \"free-to-air\"(FTA) satellite TV broadcast markets such as Germany. SES Platform Services also provides Microsoft or Flash digital rights management for Internet streamed channels.\n\nAlthough the majority of SES Platform Services broadcasting traffic is digital television channels in SD or HD uplinked to the Astra satellites, SES Platform Services can also distribute programming to mobiles as on-demand content, and as live or on-demand video over the Internet using Windows Media Player, QuickTime or Flash.\n\nIn April 2011, SES Platform Services opened a new playout centre at its headquarters in Unterföhring to handle expansion of the company, and its client list. The new network operations centre is in a purpose-built new building with the latest technologies including air conditioning based on groundwater cooling, fully redundant power distribution system, and LED screens and LED room lighting in the master control room to minimise heat generation. The old premises are being retained as back-up facilities and the new centre is expected to cope with growth for the next five years.\n\nIn June 2015 SES Platform Services launched its Fluid Hub managed cloud service for management, playout and distribution of video content for studios, content creators, broadcasting companies, telcos/platforms and other customers.

In the following twelve years, Wood built nine more \"Miss America\"s and broke the record five times. Increased public interest generated by the speeds achieved by Wood and others led to an official speed record being ratified in 1928. The first person to try a record attempt was Wood's brother, George. On 4 September 1928, he drove \"Miss America VII\" to on the Detroit River. The next year, Gar Wood took the same boat up a waterway Indian Creek, Miami and reached .\n\nLike the land speed record, the water record was destined to become a scrap for national honour between Britain and the USA. American success in setting records spurred Castrol Oil chairman Lord Wakefield to sponsor a project to bring the water record to Britain. Famed land speed racer and racing driver Sir Henry Segrave was hired to pilot a new boat, \"Miss England\". Although the boat wasn’t capable of beating Wood's \"Miss America\", the British team did gain experience, which was put into an improved boat. \"Miss England II\" was powered by two Rolls-Royce aircraft engines and seemed capable of beating Wood's record.\n\nOn 13 June 1930 Segrave piloted \"Miss England II\" to a new record of average speed during two runs on Windermere, in Britain's Lake District. Having set the record, Segrave set off on a third run to try to improve the record further. Unfortunately during the run, the boat struck an object in the water and capsized, with both Segrave and his co-driver receiving fatal injuries.\n\nFollowing Segrave's death, \"Miss England II\" was salvaged and repaired. Kaye Don was chosen as the new driver for 1931. However, during this time, Gar Wood recaptured the record for the U.S. at . A month later on Lake Garda, Don got the record back with . In February, 1932 Wood responded, nudging the mark to .\n\nIn response to the continued American challenge, the British team built a new boat, \"Miss England III\". The design was an evolution of the predecessor, with a squared-off stern and twin propellers being the main improvements. Don took the new boat to Loch Lomond, Scotland, on 18 July 1932, improved the record first to , then to on a second run.\n\nDetermined to have the last word over his great rival, Gar Wood built another new \"Miss America\". \"Miss America X\" was 12 metres long, powered by four supercharged Packard aeroplane engines. On 20 September 1932 Wood broke the 200 km/h barrier, driving his new boat to . It would prove the end of an era. Don declined to attempt any further records, and \"Miss England III\" went to the National Maritime Museum in London, where it remains on display. Wood also opted to scale down his involvement in racing and returned to running his businesses. Somewhat ironically, both record-breakers lived into their 90s. Wood died in 1971, Don in 1985.\n\nWood's last record would be one of the final records for a conventional, single-keel boat. In June 1937 Malcolm Campbell, the world-famous land speed record breaker, drove \"Blue Bird K3\" to a new record of at Lake Maggiore. Compared to the massive \"Miss America X\", \"K3\" was a much more compact craft. It was 5 metres shorter and had one engine to X's four.\n\nDespite his success, Campbell was unsatisfied by the relatively small increase in speed. He commissioned a new \"Blue Bird\" to be built. \"Blue Bird K4\" was a ‘three pointer’ hydroplane. Unlike conventional powerboats, which have a single keel, with an indent, or ‘step’, cut from the bottom to reduce drag, a hydroplane has a concave base with two sponsons fitted to the front, and a third point at the rear of the hull. When the boat increases in speed, most of the hull lifts out of the water and runs on the three contact points. The positive effect is a reduction in drag and an increase in power-to-weight ratio - the boat is lighter as it doesn't need many engines to push it along. The downside is that the three-pointer is much less stable than the single keel boat. If the hydroplane's angle of attack is upset at speed, the craft can somersault into the air, or nose-dive into the water.\n\nCampbell's new boat was a success. In 1939, on the eve of the Second World War, he took it to Coniston Water and increased his record by , to .\n\nThe return of peace in 1945 brought with it a new form of power for the record breaker – the jet engine. Campbell immediately renovated \"Blue Bird K4\" with a De Havilland Goblin jet engine. The result was a curious-looking craft, whose shoe-like profile led to it being nicknamed ‘The Coniston Slipper’. The experiment with jet-power was not a success and Campbell retired from record-attempts. He died in 1948.\n\nOn 26 June 1950, \"Slo-Mo-Shun IV\" improved on Campbell's record by . Powered by an Allison V-1710 aircraft engine, the boat was built by Seattle Chrysler dealer Stanley Sayres and was able to run because her hull was designed to lift the top of the propeller out of water when running at high speed. This phenomenon, called ‘prop riding’, further reduced drag.\n\nIn 1952, Sayres drove \"Slo-Mo-Shun\" to , a increase on his previous record.\n\nThe renewed American success persuaded Malcolm Campbell's son, Donald, who had already driven \"Blue Bird K4\" to within sight of his father's record, to make a further push for the record. However, \"Blue Bird K4\" was by now 12 years old, with a 20-year-old engine, and Campbell struggled to reach the speeds of the Seattle-built boat. In late 1951, she was written-off when it suffered a structural failure at on Coniston Water.\n\nAt this time, yet another land speed driver entered the fray. Englishman John Cobb, was hoping to reach in his jet-powered \"Crusader\". A radical design, the \"Crusader\" reversed the ‘three-pointer’ design, placing the sponsons at the rear of the hull. On 29 September 1952 Cobb tried to beat the world record on Loch Ness but, while travelling at an estimated , \"Crusader\"'s front plane collapsed and the craft instantly disintegrated. Cobb was retrieved from the water but had already died of shock.\n\nTwo years later, on 8 October 1954, another man would die trying for the record. Italian textile magnates Mario Verga and Francesco Vitetta, responding to a prize offer of 5 million lire from the Italian Motorboat Federation to any Italian who broke the world record, built a sleek piston-engined hydroplane to claim the record. Named \"Laura III\", after Verga's daughter, the boat was fast but unstable. Travelling across Lake Iseo, in Northern Italy, at close to , Verga lost control of \"Laura III\", and was thrown out into the water when the boat somersaulted. Like Cobb, he died of shock.\n\nFollowing Cobb's death, Donald Campbell started working on a new \"Bluebird\", \"K7\", a jet-powered hydroplane. Learning the many lessons from Cobb's ill-starred \"Crusader\", K7 was designed as a classic 3 pointer with sponsons forward alongside the cockpit. She was designed by Ken and Lewis Norris in 1953-54 and was completed in early 1955. It was powered by a Metropolitan-Vickers Beryl turbojet of thrust. K7 was of all-metal construction and proved to have extremely high rigidity.\n\nCampbell and \"K7\" set a new record of on Ullswater in July 1955. Campbell and \"K7\" went on to break the record a further six times over the next nine years in the USA and England (Coniston Water), finally increasing it to at Lake Dumbleyung in Western Australia in 1964. Campbell thus became the most prolific water speed record breaker of all time.\n\nAt the time Campbell set the absolute record, the piston-powered propeller-driven record was held by the George Simons' \"Miss U.S. I\" at . This record was set at Guntersville, Alabama in 1962 by Roy Duby and stood for 38 years.\n\nDonald Campbell's \"Bluebird K7\" had been re-engined with a Bristol Siddeley Orpheus jet rated at of thrust. On 4 January 1967 he tried again. His first run averaged and a new record seemed in sight. Campbell applied \"K7\"'s water brake to slow the craft down from her peak speed of clear of the measured kilometre to a speed around . Rather than waiting for the lake to settle again before starting the mandatory return leg, Campbell immediately turned around at the end of the lake and began his return run. At around , just as she entered the measured kilometre, Bluebird began to lose stability and 400 m before the end of the kilometre, Bluebird's nose lifted beyond its critical pitch angle and she started to rise out of the water at a 45 degree angle. The boat took off, somersaulted and then plunged nose-first into the lake, breaking up as she cartwheeled across the surface. Campbell was killed instantly. Prolonged searches over the next two weeks located the wreck, but it was not until May 2001 that Campbell's body was finally located and recovered. Campbell was buried in the churchyard at Coniston on 12 September 2001.\n\nLee Taylor, a Californian boat racer, in \"Hustler\" during a test run on Lake Havasu, was unable to shut down the jet and crashed into the lakeside at over . \"Hustler\" was wrecked and Taylor was severely injured. He spent the following years recuperating, and rebuilding his boat. On 30 June 1967, on Lake Guntersville, Taylor and \"Hustler\" tried for the record, but the wake of some spectators' boats disturbed the water, forcing Taylor to slow down his second run, and he came up short. He tried again later the same day and succeeded in setting a new record of .\n\nUntil 20 November 1977 every official water speed record had been set by an American, Canadian, Irishman, or Briton. That day Ken Warby became the first Australian holder when he piloted his \"Spirit of Australia\" to 464.46 km/h (288.60 mph) to beat Lee Taylor's record. Warby, who had built the craft in his back yard, used the publicity to find sponsorship to pay for improvements to the Spirit. On 8 October 1978 Warby travelled to Blowering Dam, Australia, and broke both the 480 km/h (300 mph) and 500 km/h barriers with an average speed of 511.12 km/h (317.6 mph). As he exited the course his peak speed as measured on a radar gun was approximately 552 km/h (345 mph).\n\nWarby's record still stands . There have only been two official attempts to break it, both resulting in the death of the driver.\n\nLee Taylor tried to get the record back in 1980. Inspired by the land speed record cars \"Blue Flame\" and \"Budweiser Rocket\", Taylor built a rocket-powered boat, \"Discovery II\". The long craft was a reverse three-point design, similar to John Cobb's \"Crusader\", albeit of much greater length.\n\nOriginally Taylor tested the boat on Walker Lake in Nevada but his backers demanded a more accessible location, so Taylor switched to Lake Tahoe. An attempt was set for 13 November 1980, but when conditions on the lake proved unfavourable, Taylor decided against trying for the record. Not wanting to disappoint the assembled spectators and media, he decided to do a test run instead. At 432 km/h (270 mph) \"Discovery II\" started to become unstable. It has been speculated that it may have hit a swell. Whatever the cause, the boat's unstable lateral oscillations caused the left float to collapse, sending the boat plunging into the water. The cockpit section with Taylor's body was recovered three days later. The cockpit had not floated as intended and Taylor drowned as a result.\n\nIn 1989 Craig Arfons, son of Walt Arfons, builder of the world's first jet car, and nephew of famed record breaker Art Arfons, tried for the record in his all-composite fiberglass/Kevlar \"Rain X Challenger\", but died when the hydroplane somersaulted at 483 km/h (301.875 mph).\n\nDespite the high fatality rate, the record is still coveted by boat enthusiasts and racers. While a number of projects aiming for the record have been started, currently just those below appear to be active:\n\nThe British \"Quicksliver\" project is managed by Nigel Macknight.\nThe design was initially based on concepts for a rear-sponsoned configuration by Ken Norris, who had worked with the Campbells on their 'Bluebird' designs. The design is of modular construction with the main body consisting of a front section with a steel spaceframe incorporating the engine, a Rolls-Royce Spey Mk.101, and the rear section a monocoque extending to the tail. The front sponsons are also modules, one of which contains the driver.\n\nKen Warby is working with his son David on a new boat, powered by a jet engine taken from an Fiat G.91, to break the record. Earlier in 2003, Ken Warby had built another boat, \"Aussie Spirit\" for a record attempt.\n\nThe K777 Team is a combination of engineers, boat racers, boat builders, gas turbine specialists and Members of Windermere Boat Racing Club. They built a controversial visual copy of Donald Campbell's \"Bluebird\" K7, though during its sole public appearance on Coniston Water in 2011 it failed to plane, partially sank, and ultimately collapsed its air intake trunking. A test on Loch Ken, in south-west Scotland, in October 2014 was also unsuccessful; although the boat did not sink, it was again unable to plane.\n\nDaniel Dehaemers is the Belgian challenger for the absolute water speed record. The SP600 is of full carbon composite construction and is powered by a Rolls-Royce Adour 104 turbojet engine. The boat was planned to be tested during 2016. However, after finishing building the boat he died of cancer in 2018 before he managed to trial the craft. \n\nA British Team, with a serving British Military pilot at the helm, are working together to build and run \"Longbow\" , a jet hydroplane, on lakes and lochs within the UK, for a British attempt upon the Outright World Water Speed Record.\n\n\n\n"}
