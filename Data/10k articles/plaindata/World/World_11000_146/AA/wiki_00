Initially, the companies combined the \"gendarmes\" (fully armoured men-at-arms) along with lighter \"coutiliers\" and \"archers\" in the same mounted formation, with the better armoured men forming the foremost ranks. However, as time passed the lighter horsemen were increasingly separated into independent formations of \"medium\" cavalry, bearing lighter armour and much shorter lances than the \"gendarmes\". These lighter formations eventually gained the name of \"chevau légers\". A similar development also happened in the organization of the Austrian and Spanish cavalry with the growth of \"caballería ligera\" formations.\n\nTheir original similarities to lancer units meant that in the armies of the Napoleonic Wars the title came to be applied for both sword armed medium cavalry and lancer cavalry units interchangeably, depending on the regional custom. Examples of this include the famous Polish 1st Light Cavalry Regiment of the French Guards and the 2e régiment de chevau-légers lanciers de la Garde Impériale, both subtitled \"Chevau-légers\" despite being light lancer cavalry. While the Austrian and many other German states retained \"Chevau-légers\" that were actually sword armed medium cavalry.\n"}

{"id": "38262103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38262103", "title": "E-commerce in Southeast Asia", "text": "E-commerce in Southeast Asia\n\nElectronic commerce or \"e-commerce in Southeast Asia\" is the buying and selling of products and services over the internet in the countries of Southeast Asia. These practices reached Southeast Asia during the dot-com mania in the 1990s. After the dot-com bust, native e-companies have seen promising and fast growth in their sector.\n\nDuring the 1990s, due to the Internet and the beginning of e-commerce, it was possible for Southeast Asian consumers to purchase items from American and European companies that would be delivered in their countries. The dot-com companies’ stock prices skyrocketed, and native companies felt they needed to catch up to the other high selling e-commerce countries, choosing to underestimate the risks of launching many e-companies and letting the market decide which ones would succeed.\n\nAsia had begun to attract nearly half of the total capital inflow from developing countries, appealed by the high interest rates. The economies of Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia saw a high GDP growth rates up to 12 percent, due to the stable Asian economies, the World Bank and the IMF for the benefit of the Asian local companies.\n\nPurchasing power was growing as well as the number of e-commerce companies in each market, which promised a bright future for e-commerce.\n\nAfter 2000, the e-commerce market was mainly dominated by business-to-business (B2B) transactions due to consumer mistrust after going through the 1997’s financial crisis in Southeast Asia and the bubble burst. The only way e-commerce companies could re-enter the business-to-consumer (B2C) market was to earn back consumer trust. Companies like Amazon.com, for example, spent almost a decade, in coordination with the Southeast Asian governments that contributed by becoming “Internet-friendly”, to rebuild that trust.\n\nIn addition to consumer mistrust, e-companies had to face low Internet usage. According to Nielsen, the average Southeast Asian Internet penetration today is around 38 percent among the 15 and over population, with the exception of Singapore where the use of Internet is widespread (at around 67 percent). This number is comparatively low to the rest of the world with Australia (at 78.9 percent), United States (at 78.1 percent), Germany (at 83.0 percent) and Japan (at 79.5 percent).\n\nOthers hurdles to overcome are cultural. For example, the number of credit card owners in Asia, and those who may are used to payment other than in cash, is small. Trust of the bank system and the electronic payments is traditionally low but government initiatives such as Thailand's PromptPay is trying to push for a \"cashless society\". The payments by credit or debit card are, however, on the rise, allowing the development of Internet services and retail. The number of fraud and the high rate of corruption in some countries also discourages people from paying over the Internet.\n\nLack of information in the industry is also a major concern as reliable market data is scarce and employees lack the digital experience needed to grow quickly. Market research brands such as ecommerceIQ are trying to fix this problem by published and sharing research and insights regarding ecommerce in Southeast Asia. The market research brand launched officially in February 2016 with Google Thailand. \n\nIn response to these challenges emerging e-commerce service providers such as WeLoveShopping, iTrueMart and aCommerce provide COD (cash on delivery) in order to penetrate second and third tier cities in Southeast Asia, as demonstrated by the 42% sales rate outside of the Thai capital, Bangkok. When participating in mobile commerce campaigns in the region, brands also noticed a higher uptake in high-priced items. \"What was most surprising to us was how well high price point items sold. We believe this is driven by the fact that customers have the option to pay via cash on delivery (COD) which reduces the perceived risk for the customer and also enables brands to target customers in regions with lower credit card penetration,\" said aCommerce Regional Chief Marketing Officer, Sheji Ho. \n\nWith bankruptcies of many dominant international companies in the beginning of 2000 Southeast Asian companies were able to take over the Internet: Blogs, reviews, social networks and others started flourishing. It was not until the end of 2011, however, that the e-commerce really re-established itself in Southeast Asia. Foreign companies no longer just ship there but actually offer products and services focusing and responsive to regional needs, from local offices and warehouses.\n\nRocket Internet was the first company entering the online shopping market at a large scale in the region, through Singapore, with its fashion venture Zalora. Following that success, Rocket Internet launched Lazada Malaysia, an Amazon.com equivalent offering a range of products from electronics, recreation, home appliances, books, video games, health and beauty products, toys, baby products, and fashion items such as bags. The idea was to exploit the Southeast Asian market by offering the opportunity to get the same products that they used to purchase through foreign companies along with local products from an online company just around the corner. Either way, it takes only a few days for delivery whereas it took up to a month before. Zalora and Lazada Malaysia rapidly spread out to neighbor countries and figure now among the more visited and efficient websites in South-East Asia. That is why international and important investors such as JP Morgan, Kinnevik and Summit Partners invested millions of dollars in Lazada seeing the huge potential in the Southeast Asian market.\n\nIn Thailand, WeLoveShopping was established in 2004 as a C2C online marketplace by Ascend Group, a spin-off of True Corporation and subsidiary of C.P. Group. The site has recently changed its business model from earning revenue from rentals of online stores to earning commissions from transaction fees ranging from 2.9 to 13%. Payments for products will be placed in Escrow with cooperation with TrueMoney, and only when the product is delivered to the buyer satisfactorily will the seller get paid. Ascend Group also went on to set up iTrueMart in 2013 as a B2C e-commerce platform. In 2015, iTrueMart turned to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to run its e-commerce website and launched in the Philippines.\n\nTo overcome the mistrust of the consumers, e-companies adapted themselves to the market and its difficulties. In the case of Rocket Internet and aCommerce, they decided to offer the payment methods such as credit card payment and cash on delivery. Furthermore, they updated methods compared to the brick-and-mortar businesses to meet market expectations: They launched the “14 day return” policy and free and fast delivery in all countries to attract consumers back.\n\nSoon after the appearance of Lazada and Zalora.com, Rakuten, Japan's largest B2B2C online retailer, also decided to reach into the same market by launching Rakuten in Malaysia. Even though they were already working with local and small e-commerce companies in a low customer catchment area, in Thailand in 2009 and Indonesia in 2011, their Malaysian venture is their biggest achievement in the region. They also had to match consumers’ expectations by offering attractive payment methods and appealing customer service.\n\nIn response to the significant growth in the number of online retailers, price-comparison websites became another e-commerce business on the rise. They compile product database from online retailers, traffic users to their websites, before redirecting to the designated merchants. Examples of these websites are Priceza, iprice, PricePanda, and NowCheapcheap.\n\nDespite the lack of trust in e-commerce and several cultural issues coming from the recent financial crisis, the market for e-businesses has been growing at a double digit rate and seems poised to become one of the most profitable sectors.\n"}

Until then, the two sectors were essentially treated by the British as two separate colonies because of ethnic, religious and cultural differences. Northern Sudan was heavily Arabized and had a fairly well-structured political and economic infrastructure. Northerners practiced Islam and were relatively well-educated. Southern Sudan was mainly composed of various Nilotic tribes who practiced a mixture of Christian and traditional beliefs. Economically, it did not possess the organization of northern Sudan.\n\nThe Juba Conference agreed that northern and southern Sudan would constitute one state and that a Legislative Assembly would represent the entire colony.

{"id": "615067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=615067", "title": "Paisa", "text": "Paisa\n\nThe paisa (Nepali/, ), poisha () or baisa (Omani: بيسة) is a monetary unit in several countries. In India, Nepal and Pakistan, the \"paisa\" currently equals of a rupee. In Bangladesh, the \"poisha\" equals of a Bangladeshi taka. In Oman, the \"baisa\" equals of an Omani rial.\n\nThe word \"paisa\" is from the Sanskrit term \"padāṁśa\", meaning 'quarter part', from \"pada\" \"foot or quarter\" and \"aṁśa\" \"part\". Another explanation is that the word derives from Portuguese ´pesa´ from which peso and diminutive peseta are derived. The pesa was also in use in colonial Kenya. The colloquial term for money in Burmese, \"paiksan\" (), derives from the Hindi term \"paisa\".\n\nUntil the 1950s in India and Pakistan (and before 1947 in British India), the paisa was equivalent to 3 pies, of an anna, or of a rupee. After the transition from a non-decimal currency to a decimal currency, the paisa equaled of a rupee and was known as a \"naya paisa\" (\"new paisa\") for a few years to distinguish it from the old paisa that was of a rupee.\n\n1/15/3/2 = 1.9947\n1/8/3 = 1.546\n1/4 = 1.25\n\nIn Hindi, Afghan Persian, and other languages, the word paisa often means money or cash. Medieval trade routes that spanned the Arabian Sea between India, the Arab regions and East Africa spread the usage of Indian subcontinent and Arabic currency terms across these areas. The word \"pesa\" as a reference to money in East African languages such as Swahili dates from that period. An example of this usage is the older day Kenyan mobile-phone-based money transfer service M-Pesa (which stands for \"mobile pesa\" or \"mobile money\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1246706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1246706", "title": "Pan American Health Organization", "text": "Pan American Health Organization\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is an international public health agency working to improve health and living standards of the people of the Americas. It is part of the United Nations system, serving as the Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization and as the health organization of the Inter-American System. It is known in Latin America as the OPS or OPAS (; ).\n\nPAHO has scientific and technical expertise at its headquarters, in its 27 country offices, and its three Pan American centers, all working with the countries of the Americas in dealing with priority health issues. The health authorities of PAHO's Member States set PAHO's technical and administrative policies through its Governing Bodies. PAHO Member States include all 35 countries in the Americas; Puerto Rico is an Associate Member. France, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are Participating States, and Portugal and Spain are Observer States.\n\nThe Organization's essential mission is to strengthen national and local health systems and improve the health of the peoples of the Americas, in collaboration with Ministries of Health, other government and international agencies, nongovernmental organizations, universities, social security agencies, community groups, and many others.\n\nPAHO promotes universal health coverage and universal access to health and strengthening of health systems based on primary health care strategies. It assists countries in fighting infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera, dengue, HIV and tuberculosis as well as the region's growing epidemic of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. PAHO engages in technical cooperation with ministries of health and facilitates coordination with other sectors to promote health in all policies. PAHO also promotes the use of research evidence to inform health care decisions and policymaking through the implementation of knowledge translation strategies such as the Evidence Informed Policy Network - EVIPNet Evipnet. \nIn its efforts to improve health, PAHO targets the most vulnerable groups including mothers and children, workers, the poor, the elderly, and refugees and displaced persons. It focuses on issues related to equity for those who lack access to health, and on a Pan American approach, encouraging countries to work together on common issues and build lasting capacities.\n\nSpecific initiatives spearheaded by PAHO include the Expanded Program on Immunization, which played a major role in the elimination of smallpox and polio from the Americas; the Tobacco-free Americas initiative; the Regional Coalition for Water and Sanitation to Eliminate Cholera in Hispaniola; the Salt Smart Consortium; the Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization; and a blood safety initiative that seeks to improve blood safety and efficiency by helping countries reach 100% blood supplies from unpaid voluntary donors.\n\nA major priority for the Americas is cutting infant mortality, and PAHO is mobilizing new political, institutional and financial resources to prevent an additional 25,000 infant deaths every year through application of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy, a simple and practical approach in which primary health care workers are taught a complete process to evaluate the health status of children brought to a health post or clinic. They learn to recognize signs of disease and evaluate and treat them. They learn to give parents information on how to prevent disease in the home. If they see danger signs indicating the infant could die, they are taught to treat the child immediately or take him or her to a hospital.\n\nImprovement of drinking water supplies, adequate sanitation, and increased access to health care for the poor are still top priorities for PAHO, with a focus on equity. The Organization is intensifying its efforts to have countries know the true state of health of their populations and where the inequalities lie. Program efforts focus on correcting inequality, taking into account decentralization and change of state functions, on showing that health has a role to play in the success of other sectors, and on how attention to health affects positively other aspects of human development. Advocacy in this area is also directed to reducing pernicious gender inequity, which reflects in some health problems of women.\n\nThe Pan American approach is a part of PAHO history and the spirit of Panamericanism continues to stimulate technical cooperation among countries in health. PAHO has helped countries work together toward common goals, and to initiate multi-country health ventures in Central America, the Caribbean, the Andean Region, and the Southern Cone. Experience has shown practical benefits such as the solidarity that helped Central America after hurricane Mitch, and there are numerous other examples. Health collaboration found expression at the highest political level when American heads of state in their Summit in Santiago accepted a health initiative called \"Health Technology Linking the Americas.\"\n\nThe countries of Latin America and the Caribbean joined together over 20 years ago to buy vaccines through a revolving fund, bringing them tangible benefits and helping advance PAHO's efforts to eliminate or control vaccine-preventable diseases. These are among the Organization's most notable successes, starting with the eradication of smallpox from the Americas in 1973; a triumph followed five years later by global eradication of the dreaded disease.\n\nA major effort committing the Americas to embark on polio eradication in 1985 succeeded in September 1994, when a distinguished International Commission declared the Americas officially polio-free. The last case of polio in the Americas was identified August 23, 1991 in a young boy named Luis Fermín Tenorio Cortez, in Junín, Peru. Since then, despite intensive surveillance, no cases of polio have been detected anywhere in the Americas, and the World Health Organization is now working toward the goal of eradicating polio globally. PAHO assists the countries in mobilizing the necessary resources to provide immunization and treatment services for all vaccine-preventable diseases. PAHO is close to accomplishing the goal of eliminating measles from this hemisphere and is pressing on with the introduction of new vaccines that are currently available, such as Haemophilus influenzae B. to reduce meningitis and respiratory infections. PAHO works to reduce the toll of death and illness from diarrheal diseases, including cholera, through case management and oral rehydration therapy to prevent deaths from dehydration, and to provide adequate diagnosis and treatment of acute respiratory infections, thus saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of children each year.\n\nPAHO disseminates scientific and technical information through its publications program, its Internet site , and a network of academic libraries, documentation centers, and local health care libraries.\n\nThe Organization provides technical collaboration in a variety of specialized public health fields, and organizes emergency preparedness and disaster relief coordination. It supports efforts to strengthen national health systems, develop national health research systems, control malaria, Chagas' disease, urban rabies, leprosy, and other diseases that affect the people of the Americas. PAHO collaborates with governments, other agencies, and private groups to address major nutritional problems including protein-energy malnutrition, and is now working to eliminate iodine and vitamin A deficiencies.\n\nIt engages in and facilitates health promotion to help countries deal with health problems typical of development and urbanization, especially non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, accidents, smoking, addiction to drugs and alcohol, and injuries among others. Beyond health promotion, PAHO also addresses health systems and quality of care issues in support of national efforts to respond to the NCD pandemic.\n\nThe Organization also executes projects for other United Nations agencies, for international organizations such as the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, for official development cooperation agencies of various governments, and for philanthropic foundations.\n\nPAHO strengthens the health sector capacity in the countries to advance their priority programs through intersectoral action, promoting an integral approach to health problems. It also works to improve women's health, promoting the greater integration of women in society, as well as awareness of their importance as both recipients and providers of health services.\n\nPAHO trains health workers at all levels, through fellowships, courses and seminars, and the strengthening of national training institutions. It leads in the use of advanced communications technologies for information, health promotion, and education, working with journalists in many countries.\n\nThe Organization recognizes the role of the private sector in the delivery of services, and fosters dialogue and partnerships with the Ministries of Health. In addition to its core budget financed by quota contributions from its Member Governments, PAHO also seeks outside funding to help implement special programs and initiatives in response to vital health needs. Voluntary tax-deductible contributions for PAHO health and education projects in the Americas may be made to the PAHO Foundation.\n\nDr. Carissa F. Etienne of the Commonwealth of Dominica was elected as the new director of PAHO on January 31, 2013. PAHO's Deputy Director is Dr. Isabella Danel, of the United States, and the Assistant Director is Jarbas Barbosa, from Brazil.\n\nThe organization was founded in December 1902. It was originally called the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau. In 1949, PAHO and WHO signed an agreement making PAHO the American Regional Office (AMRO) of WHO. Today the usual phrasing is \"Regional Office for the Americas\". \n\nThe building was designed in a modernist style by Uruguayan architect Roman Fresnedo Siri as a tribute to Le Corbusier, who inspired Siri's other works. Constructed in 1965, the exterior features 29 round bronze seals of the founding nations of the Pan American Health Organization set in black stone. Each medallion is 2.5 feet in diameter and were designed by American sculptor Michael Lantz. They were originally meant to be carved in granite. The east side of the south facade (left to right) seals are for: France, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The west side of the south facade seals are for: Argentina, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and El Salvador. In 1993 the seals were surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program and were described as needing conservation treatment.\n\n\n\n"}

It is his first novel followed by \"The Twenty-Second Day\" in 2007. Aladdin that he wrote the novel in two days, separated by 6 months, and that he did not change a word of it. it made Aladdin name in the Arabic literary scene, described it as a \"tour de force\". Because of it, and his entire body of work to date, Aladdin is often described as \"an innovator in the Arabic literature\".\n\nA young man walks a scorching Cairo street. At the entrance to the city’s pivotal main square, he notices a succulent girl. Ineluctably drawn into her magnetic field, and the swirling, palpitating square ahead, he starts to fantasize about how he would talk to her, seduce her, rape her, love her, abandon her, cherish her were he, for example, a Brazen Rake, a Brutal Bohemian, a Sensitive Painter, or a Bald Mechanic, jumping from persona to persona as his imaginings become more and more feverish, while in his mind the girl goes through a similar series of transformations. These characters—a circus parade of Egypt’s contemporary human menagerie—are not, however, mere dress-up costumes to be donned and discarded at their author’s whim. They, and others who emerge from the side alleys of his mind, strut their stuff, accost one another, argue, and shout until eventually they leave him, on a scorching Cairo street, peering after an infinite succession of receding, parallel clamorous worlds, from whose possibilities he must draw his own conclusions.\n\nMuhammad Aladdin (b. 1979) has published short comic books for teenagers and a collection of short stories (\"The Other Bank\" 2003). While excerpts from his first, unpublished novel \"The Twenty-Second Day\" appeared in Akhbar al-Adab in 2004, his first unpublished—as well—novel \"Al Dawa'er\" winning the Cultural Palaces prize 2004. \"The Gospel according to Adam\" breaks the conventional format of the novel, consisting as it does of a single 60-page-long paragraph that, like all good streams of consciousness, sweeps writer and reader on to no pre-ordained or predictable destination. As a reviewer for Al-Ahram's literary page ( May 10, 2006) puts it, The Gospel according to Adam reflects \"a social reality that has lost all certainties.\" In keeping with other novels (such as Ahmed Alaidy's \"Being Abbas el Abd\") of an emerging new school of writing in Cairo, the work is the funny and taboo-breaking product of a young writer without preconceptions of what makes a novel or how one should be written and who has been hailed by writers such as Baha Tahir and Sonallah Ibrahim as among the best of a promising new crop.\n\nIn his book, \"The Arab Novel and the Quest for Renovation\" published by Dubi Althaqafia Magazine in May 2011, the famous Moroccan writer and critic Mohammed Berrada sites it as one of 5 novels has renovated the Arab novel.\n\nThe Egyptian writer Ibraim Farghali wrote about it in the famous Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar that The Gospel According to Adam is \"An experimental and substantial jump in narration style in the modern Egyptian novels\".\n\n"}
