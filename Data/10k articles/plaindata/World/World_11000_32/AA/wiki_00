{"id": "29029581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29029581", "title": "Appalachia (Mesozoic)", "text": "Appalachia (Mesozoic)\n\nIn the Mesozoic Era (252 to 66 million years ago) Appalachia, named for the Appalachian Mountains, was an island land mass separated from Laramidia to the west by the Western Interior Seaway. The seaway eventually shrank, divided across the Dakotas, and retreated towards the Gulf of Mexico and the Hudson Bay. This left the island masses joined in the continent of North America as the Rocky Mountains rose.\n\nFrom the Turonian to the end of the Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous, Appalachia was separated from the rest of North America. As the Western Interior Seaway retreated in the Maastrichtian, Laramidia and Appalachia eventually connected. Because of this, its fauna was isolated, and developed very differently from the tyrannosaur, ceratopsian, pachycephalosaur and ankylosaur dominated fauna of the western part of North America, known as \"Laramidia\". Due to numerous undiscovered fossiliferous deposits and due the fact that half of Appalachia's fossil formations being destroyed by the Pleistocene ice age, little is known about Appalachia, with exception of plant life and the insects trapped in amber from New Jersey. Many of the various fossil formations not destroyed by the Pleistocene ice age still remain elusive to the field of paleontological study. In addition, due to a lack of interest in Appalachia, many fossils that have been found in Appalachia lie unstudied and remain in the inaccurate genera to which they were assigned in the days of E.D. Cope and O.C. Marsh. However, the area has seen a bit of a resurgence of interest due to several discoveries made in the past few years. As mentioned earlier, not much is known about Appalachia, but some fossil sites, such as the Navesink Formation, Ellisdale Fossil Site, Mooreville Chalk Formation, Demopolis Chalk Formation, Black Creek Group and the Niobrara Formation, together with ongoing research in the area, have given us a better look into this forgotten world of paleontology.\n\nIn Late Cretaceous North America, the dominant predators were the tyrannosaurs, huge predatory theropods with proportionately massive heads built for ripping flesh from their prey. Tyrannosaurs were the dominant predators in Appalachia too, but rather than the massive Tyrannosauridae, like \"Gorgosaurus\", \"Albertosaurus\" and \"Lythronax\", which evolved around the same time that the Western Interior Seaway had fully separated Laramida from Appalachia, the smaller dryptosaurs were the top predators of Appalachia. Rather than developing the huge heads and massive bodies of their kin, dryptosaurs had more in common with the basal tyrannosaurs like \"Dilong\" and \"Eotyrannus\", having long arms with three fingers, and were not as large as the largest tyrannosaurids. Three genera of valid Appalachian tyrannosaurs are known, \"Dryptosaurus\", \"Appalachiosaurus\", and the recently discovered \"Teihivenator\" while other indeterminate fossils lie scattered throughout most of the southern United States like Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These fossiled teeth possibly belong to a species of \"Appalachiosaurs\" or an undescribed species of a new tyrannosaur. There is also the possibility of a fourth tyrannosaur known from Applachia known as \"Diplotomodon\", but this is highly unlikely seeing how the genus is considered to be dubious. Various ornithomimid bones, such as \"Coelosaurus\", have also been reported from Appalachia from Missouri, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and as far north in states like Maryland, New Jersey and Delaware, but it is now believed that some of these are the bones of juvenile dryptosaurs while others belong to various undescribed species of ornithomimids. The case of \"Arkansaurus\" is such an example of indeterminate fossils being discovered to be dating back to the Early Cretaceous. The dryptosaurs weren't the only predatory dinosaurs in Appalachia. Indeterminate dromaeosaurine fossils and teeth, most closely matching those of \"Saurornitholestes\", have also been unearthed in Appalachia as well; mostly in the southern states like Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. Finds from the Campanian Tar Heel Formation in North Carolina indicate that there may have been dromaeosaurids of considerable size; intermediate between genera such as \"Saurornitholestes\" and \"Dakotaraptor\". Though known only from teeth, the discovery indicates large dromaeosaurids were part of Appalachia's fauna. Along with the dromaeosauridae remains, tyrannosauroidea and possible ornithomimid remains have been unearthed in Missouri as well.\n\nAnother common group, arguably the most wide spread species in the area, of Appalachian dinosaurs were the Hadrosauroidea, which is now considered to be their \"ancestral homeland\"; eventually making their way to Laramidia, Asia, Europe, South America and Antarctica where they diversified into the lambeosaurine and saurolophine dinosaurs, though some of the primitive hadrosaurs were still present until the end of the Mesozoic. While the fossil record shows a staggering variety of hadrosaur forms in Laramidia, hadrosaur remains for Appalachia show less diversity due to the relative uncommon number of fossil beds. However, many hadrosaurs are known from Appalachia, such as \"Claosaurus\", \"Eotrachodon\", \"Lophorhothon\", \"Hypsibema crassicauda\", \"Hypsibema missouriensis\", and \"Hadrosaurus\". These hadrosaurs from Appalachia seem to be closely related to the crestless hadrosaurs of Laramidia like \"Gryposaurus\" and \"Edmontosaurus\", despite the fact that they are not considered to be saurolophines. \"Claosaurus\" is known from a specimen which floated into the Interior Seaway and was found in Kansas, might also be from Appalachia, since it was found closer to the Appalachia side of the seaway and is unknown from Western North America. Hadrosaur remains have even been found in Iowa, though in fragmentary remains, Tennessee, most notably from the Coon Creek Formation. \"Hypsibema crassicauda\", over fifty feet long, was one of the largest eastern hadrosaurs, outgrowing some of more derived western hadrosaurs like \"Lambeosaurus\" and \"Saurolophus\". The genus likely took the environmental niche occupied by large sauropods in other areas, possibly grown to colossal sizes to that of \"Magnapaulia\" and \"Shantungosaurus\". \"Hypsibema missouriensis\", was another large species of hadrosaur, but it grew up to 45 to 49 feet, which wasn't as large as \"Hypsibema crassicauda\". When it was first discovered in 1945, it was mistaken for a species of sauropod. Hypsibema missouriensis, possibly even all of the other hadrosaurs living on Appalachia, had serrated teeth for chewing the vegetation in the area. Indeterminate lambeosaurinae remains, mostly similar to \"Corythosaurus\", have been reported from New Jersey's Navesink Formation and Nova Scotia, Canada. It cannot yet be explained how lambeosaurines might have reached Appalachia though some have theorized that a land bridge must have formed some time during the Campanian.\n\nThe nodosaurids, a group of large, herbivorous armored dinosaurs resembling armadillos, are another testament to Appalachia's difference from Laramidia. During the early Cretaceous, the nodosaurids prospered and were one of the most wide spread dinosaurs throughout North America. However, by the latest Cretaceous, nodosaurids were scarce in western North America, limited to forms like \"Edmontonia\", \"Denversaurus\" and \"Panoplosaurus\"; perhaps due to competition from the ankylosauridae; though they did thrive in isolation, most notably in Appalachia, as mentioned earlier and in the case of \"Struthiosaurus\", Europe as well. Nodosaurid scutes have been commonly found in eastern North America, while fossil specimens are very rare. Often the findings are not diagnostic enough to identify the species, but the remains attest to a greater number of these armored dinosaurs in Appalachia. Multiple specimens have been unearthed in Kansas in the Niobrara Formation, Alabama in Ripley Formation, Mississippi, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey, possibly belonging to a multitude of different species. Five possible and best known examples of Appalachian nodosaurids, from both the early and late Cretaceous period, include \"Priconodon\", \"Propanoplosaurus\", \"Niobrarasaurus\", \"Silvisaurus\" and possibly \"Hierosaurus\", though its validity is disputed. Just like the \"Claosaurus\" specimen, it is possible that the specimens of \"Niobrarasaurus\", \"Silvisaurus\" and \"Hierosaurus\" floated into the Interior Seaway from the east, since these two species of nodosaurids were discovered in the famous chalk formations of Kansas and are not known from any location from Western North America. Kansas was also a part of Appalachia when the other parts were covered by oceans, which were a part of the Western Interior Seaway.\n\nWhile remains of the advanced ceratopsians, most notably the centrosaurines and chasmosaurines which were very common in Laramidia during this timeperiod, where not found in Appalachia, the leptoceratopsids somehow managed to inhabit that location. A Campanian-era leptoceratopsid ceratopsian has been found in the Tar Heel Formation, marking the first discovery of a ceratopsian dinosaur in the Appalachian zone. This specimen bears a uniquely long, slender and downcurved upper jaw, suggesting that it was an animal with a specialised feeding strategy, yet another example of speciation on an island environment. Recently, a ceratopsian teeth were unearthed in Mississippi's Owl Creek Formation,<ref name=\"http://www.wlox.com/story/32562654/paleontologists-make-big-dinosaur-discovery-in-mississippi\"></ref> which have been dated to be 67 million years old.<ref name=\"http://www.wapt.com/news/mississippi/rare-dinosaur-tooth-found-in-mississippi/40929616\"></ref> While leptoceratopids remains, the few that have been discovered in recent years, have been unearthed in the southern part of Appalachia, they appear to be completely absent from the northern part of Appalachia, states like New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland. Suggesting the idea, proposed by paleontologist David R. Schwimmer, that there was a possible providence during the Late Cretaceous.\n\nSeveral bird remains are known from Appalachian sites, most of them sea birds like Hesperornithes, \"Ichthyornis\", Enantiornithes like \"Halimornis\" and \"Ornithuraes\" like \"Apatornis\" and \"Iaceornis\". Of particular interest are possible lithornithid remains in New Jersey, arguably one of the best records for Cretaceous birds as some specimens were preserved in the greensands in the area, which would represent a clear example of palaeognath Neornithes in the Late Cretaceous. However, this issue is still under debate.\n\nThrough the Ellisdale Fossil Site, a good picture of Appalachia's non-dinosaurian fauna is present. Amidst lissamphibians, there is evidence for sirenids (including the large \"Habrosaurus\"), the batrachosauroidid salamander \"Parrisia\", hylids, possible representatives of \"Eopelobates\" and \"Discoglossus\", showing close similarities to European faunas, but aside from \"Habrosaurus\" (which is also found on Laramidia) there is a high degree of endemism, suggesting no interchanges with other landmasses throughout the Late Cretaceous. There is also a high degree of endemism in regards for its reptilian fauna: among squamates, the teiid Prototeius is exclusive to the landmass, and native representatives of Iguanidae, Helodermatidae, and Necrosauridae. Amidst turtles, \"Adocus\", \"Apalone\", and \"Bothremys\" are well represented, the latter in particular more common in appalachian sites than laramidian ones. The five local crocodilian genera, \"Deinosuchus\", \"Thoracosaurus\", \"Eothoracosaurus\",\"Leidyosuchus\", \"Borealosuchus\", are well established in Laramidia as well, probably indicative of their ocean crossing capacities. \"Deinosuchus\", being one of the largest crocodilians of the fossil record, was an apex predator that did prey on the dinosaurs in the area, the same case applies for Laramidia as well, despite the fact that the majority of its diet consisted of turtles and sea turtles. Pterosaur fossils, mostly similar to \"Pteranodon\" and \"Nyctosaurus\", have been unearthed in Georgia, Alabama and Delaware. On a similar note, azhdrachid remains have been reported in Tennessee. No fossilized remains of snakes have been discovered in Appalachia during the Cretaceous period, only being found in Laramidia.\n\nSeveral types of mammals are also present on Ellisdale and in the both of the Carolinas. The most common are ptilodontoidean multituberculates, such as \"Mesodma\", \"Cimolodon\" and a massively sized species. The sheer diversity of species on the landmass, as well as the earlier appearance compared to other Late Cretaceous locales, suggests that ptilodontoideans evolved in Appalachia. Metatherian are also known, including an alphadontid, a stagodontid, and an herpetotheriid. Unlike ptilodontoideans, metatherians show a lesser degree of endemism, implying a degree of interchange with Laramidia and Europe.\n"}

It was founded in 1975 in response to the Vietnam War/American War. The Center describes its mission as promoting \"cooperation, transparency and accountability in global relations. Through research and advocacy, our programs address the most urgent threats to our planet: war, corruption, inequality and climate change.\" The Center is the parent organization for a variety of projects, including Security Assistance Monitor, Win Without War and the Arms & Security Project. It also has collaborated with the Washington Office on Latin America and the Latin America Working Group to publish the \"Just the Facts\" website.\n\nSeveral prominent individuals serve as senior fellows and board members with CIP, including former Costa Rican president Óscar Arias Sánchez, UN ambassador Dessima Williams, Michael Barnes, and Matthew Hoh.\n\nThe Center was founded in 1975 under the fiscal sponsorship of the Fund for Peace by activists, including Bill Goodfellow and then-retired US foreign service official Donald Ranard, who served as the Center's first Executive Director.\n\nDuring its first years, the Center focused its work on Asia, especially United States foreign policy towards South Korea and its relationships with the Park Chung-hee-led government. In 1976, Ranard testified to Congress on human rights violations in South Korea and the role of South Korean lobbyists in Washington. In 1978, the Center established an Indochina Program, which advocated the normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia; the program was closed 11 years later in 1989.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, while at the time also co-chairs of the Center's Board, US Representatives Donald Fraser and Tom Harkin introduced legislation that incorporated foreign countries' human rights records into consideration of security and economic aid.\n\nDuring the 1980s, CIP campaigned in support of the Contadora Group and the subsequent Esquipulas Peace Agreement.\n\nAfter South Africa received a loan from the International Monetary Fund in 1983, the Center began a campaign that pushed for provisions that prohibited the US representative to the IMF to support loans to countries that practice apartheid. The Center continued its work with research into labor practices and economic impacts of apartheid in South Africa.\n\nIn 1990, the Center established a joint program with the Costa Rica-based Arias Foundation, founded by Óscar Arias. The organisation's new President, Robert White, also worked extensively with Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide during his exile in Washington in the 1990s.\n\nWayne Smith joined the Center in 1991 to establish the Cuba program, working towards the normalisation of relations between the United States and Cuba.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Adam Isacson established the Latin American Security program, which still operates today. The program campaigned against the militarisation of Plan Colombia and supporting the movement of funds to programs for judicial reforms and economic development. In June 1999, the program led the first ever congressional delegation to meet with insurgent leaders inside the territory they controlled.\n\nClarissa Segun and Paul Olweny, leaders for the Demilitarization for Democracy project, joined the Center in 2000. The project campaigned for diplomatic aid and United Nations peacekeeping. The project eventually closed in 2006.\n\nSarah Stephens worked on Cuba policy, joining the Center in 2001 with the Freedom to Travel project. She left CIP in 2006 and then launched the Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA).\n\nIn 2003, then-President Robert White established a program focused on governmental corruption in Central America, specifically illegal logging in Honduras. Former Washington Post foreign correspondent Selig Harrison joined CIP in the same year to head the Center's Asia program which focused on North Korea and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nWith the publishing of his book \"Capitalism's Achilles Heel: Dirty Money and How to Renew the Free-Market System\" (Wiley & Sons, 2005), CIP senior fellow Raymond Baker founds Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a non-profit, research and advocacy organisation focused on the role of illicit financial flows.\n\nIn June 2007, the Americas Program joined CIP after the dissolution of the International Relations Center. The Americas Program continues as the TransBorder Project and the Americas Project today.\n\nThe Center currently operates six programs including Win Without War, Security Assistance Monitor, the Arms &n Security Project among others. In its capacity, the Center also fiscally sponsors the environmental protection organization, Mighty Earth.\n\nWin Without War is coalition that promotes a more progressive national security strategy. \nFormed in 2002 to lead the first national campaign against the war in Iraq and the policies of the Bush/Cheney Administration, Win Without War continues as a core program of CIP directed by Stephen Miles.\n\nCurrent projects include efforts to bring American troops home from Afghanistan, rein in spending at the Pentagon, prevent nuclear escalation with North Korea, bring awareness to US involvement in Yemen.\n\nLed by director Colby Goodman, Security Assistance Monitor tracks and analyzes U.S. security and defense assistance programs worldwide. By informing policymakers, media, scholars, NGOs and the public in the United States and abroad about trends and issues related to U.S. foreign security assistance, their aim is to enhance transparency and promote greater oversight of U.S. military and police aid, arms sales and training.\n\nThe SAM database compiles all publicly available data on U.S. foreign security assistance programs worldwide from 2000 to the present. Collected from a wide range of government documents, the database provides detailed numbers on U.S. arms sales, military and police aid and training programs. Users can search these numbers by country, region, program and assistance type.\n\nThe Arms and Security Project engages in media outreach and public education aimed at promoting reforms in U.S. policies on nuclear weapons, military spending and the arms trade. It seeks to advance the notion that diplomacy and international cooperation are the most effective tools for protecting the United States. According to program director William D. Hartung, \"the use of military force is largely irrelevant in addressing the greatest dangers we face, from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, to epidemics of disease, to climate change, to inequities of wealth and income. The allocation of budgetary resources needs to be changed to reflect this reality.\"\n\nHartung's research is most frequently sited in publications such as the Hill, Defense News, the Washington Post among others.\n\n-Win Without War\n-Security Assistance Monitor\n-Arms & Security Project\n-Cuba Program\n-Americas Program\n-Global Progressive Hub\n-Avoided Deforestation Partners\n-Mighty Earth (fiscally sponsored)\n\n"}

{"id": "42089707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42089707", "title": "Role of France in the Rwandan genocide", "text": "Role of France in the Rwandan genocide\n\nThe role of France in the Rwandan genocide of 1994 has been a source of controversy and debate both within and beyond France and Rwanda. France actively supported the Hutu-led government of Juvénal Habyarimana against the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, which since 1990 had been engaged in a conflict intended to restore the rights of Rwandan Tutsis both within Rwanda and exiled in neighboring countries following over four decades of anti-Tutsi violence. France provided arms and military training to Habyarimana's youth militias, the \"Interahamwe\" and \"Impuzamugambi\", which were among the government's primary means of operationalizing the genocide following the assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira on April 6, 1994.\n\nNear the end of the 100-day genocide, French troops were deployed to establish the Turquoise Zone, largely preventing further waves of genocide within the purported safe zone. In practice, the zone enabled many genocidal Hutus to safely escape to Zaire in advance of the victorious RPF soldiers. The facts related to the French role in the Rwandan genocide have formed the focus of ongoing debate, and diplomatic relations between France and Rwanda have frequently been strained since 1994.\n\nAs a result of these actions and subsequent tensions between the two governments, after a progressive rift with the Kagame-led regime that has ruled Rwanda since 1994 (described in greater detail below), Rwanda repeatedly broke diplomatic relations with France; the Rwandan government shut down all French institutions in Rwanda, including schools and cultural organisations, with only some being subsequently reopened; the language of instruction in Rwandan schools \"has even been switched from French to English\"; and Rwanda strove to join the British-led Commonwealth, thus becoming one of only two members that were not former British colonies.\n\nIn the analysis of British journalist Linda Melvern, documents released from the Paris archive of former president François Mitterrand show how the RPF invasion in October 1990 was considered as clear aggression by an Anglophone neighbour on a Francophone country. The documents are said to argue that the RPF was a part of an \"Anglophone plot\", involving the President of Uganda, to create an English-speaking \"Tutsi-land\" and increase Anglophone influence at the expense of French influence. In Melvern's analysis, the policy of France was to avoid a military victory by the RPF. The policy had been made by a secretive network of military officers, politicians, diplomats, businessmen, and senior intelligence operatives. At its centre was Mitterrand. As a matter for the French presidency, this foreign policy was not referred to parliament.\n\nMelvern goes on to state that most of Rwanda's arms deals were negotiated through the Rwandan embassy in Paris, even if these weapons were not used for the genocide. When the genocide was over, according to her, extensive records were found in the embassy offices, but none of them concerned Rwanda's relationship with France, as the documents had been systematically destroyed by Colonel Sebastien Ntahobari, Rwanda's military attaché in France. The book also relates other forms of military assistance the government of France gave the Rwandan government, similar to what France was doing in many other African countries and part of the \"Françafrique\" politics:\n\nMelvern attributes other forms of French support for the regime. She reports that, according to Belgian intelligence in Rwanda, French diplomats advised opposition politicians that if they wanted to stop the RPF, they had to give their support to President Habyarimana.\n\nA report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) early after the genocide also reported on French armaments support for the regime. It states:\n\nHRW went on to provide that a former French policeman who had also served as security consultant to Habyarimana, Captain Paul Barril, was hired by the Rwandan Ministry of Defense to conduct a training program for 30 to 60 men, eventually to grow to 120, at Bigogwe military camp in the northwest. He was to provide training in marksmanship and infiltration tactics for an elite unit in preparation for attacks behind the RPF lines. Further, a Col. Didier Tauzin (who was later to re-enter Rwanda during the genocide under a fake name Col. Didier Tibault) was head of the French operation that had helped the Rwandan forces \"spectacularly save the situation\" in turning back the RPF offensive in February 1993. Notwithstanding HRW's associations, though, no evidence exists that these French officers were directly involved in the genocide.\n\nIn terms of balance, the HRW and Melvern analyses omitted countervailing facts known as of their writing – specifically, that there were no arms delivery by France or facilitated by France once it deemed large-scale killings likely, let alone during the mass genocide proper; and that one of the tasks that the Rwandan regime hired Barril for was to recover a pre-payment for a likely fraudulent arms delivery deal, that was stopped by the French authorities.\n\nDuring the first few days of the genocide, France launched \"Amaryllis\", a military operation involving 190 paratroopers, assisted by the Belgian army and UNAMIR, to evacuate expatriates from Rwanda. The operation was later described by Gerard Prunier as a \"disgrace,\" as the French and Belgians refused to allow any Tutsi to accompany them; those who boarded the evacuation trucks were forced off at Rwandan government checkpoints, where they were killed. The French also separated several expatriates and children from their Tutsi spouses, rescuing the foreigners but leaving the Rwandans to likely death. The French did, however, rescue several high-profile members of Habyarimana's government, as well as his wife, Agathe; in some instances, French troops used UNAMIR vehicles, without the permission of head of UNAMIR Roméo Dallaire. The French abandoned their embassy in Kigali, in the process shredding hundreds of documents containing details of their relationship with the old regime.\n\nIn late June 1994, France launched \"Opération Turquoise\", a UN-mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for displaced persons, refugees, and civilians in danger; from bases in the Zairian cities of Goma and Bukavu, the French entered southwestern Rwanda and established the \"zone Turquoise\", within the Cyangugu–Kibuye–Gikongoro triangle, an area occupying approximately a fifth of Rwanda. Radio France International estimates that Turquoise saved around 15,000 lives, but the timing of the invasion, with the genocide coming to an end and the RPF's ascendancy, led many Rwandans to interpret \"Turquoise\" primarily as a mission to protect Hutu from the RPF, including some who had participated in the genocide. The French remained hostile to the RPF, and their presence temporarily stalled the RPF's advance. According to HRW, Opération Turquoise had another purpose: Preventing a victory by the RPF. HRW reported that some military officers in Paris had talked openly of \"breaking the back of the RPF.\" According to France's National Assembly, there were no documented large-scale killings in Zone Turquoise once it was established. By that same source, it seems the French intervention did provide some significant humanitarian relief in the areas it controlled. However, the French military presence effectively helped the genocidaires to escape from the RPF and flee into neighboring Zaire.\n\nThe suspicions about United Nations and French policies in Rwanda between 1990 and 1994 and allegations that France supported the Hutus led to the creation of a French Parliamentary Commission on Rwanda, which published its report on December 15, 1998. In particular, François-Xavier Verschave, former president of the French NGO Survie, which accused the French army of protecting the Hutus during the genocide, was instrumental in establishing this Parliamentary commission.\n\nThe commission released its final report on December 15, 1998. It documented ambiguities and confusion in both the French and UN responses. Regarding Opération Turquoise, it regretted that the intervention took place too late, though it noted that this was better than the non-response from the UN and the opposition by the U.S. and U.K. governments to such a response. The report documented mixed success at disarming the Rwandan Army and militias, but a definite and systematic attempt (though not fast enough as far as then-General Paul Kagame of the opposing RPF forces was concerned, in documentation of the latter's communications with the French forces).\n\nThe Parliamentary Commission did not find any evidence of French participation in the genocide, of collaboration with the militias, or of willful disengagement from endangered populations, to the contrary. It documented multiple French operations, all at least partly successful, to disable genocide-inciting radio broadcasts, tasks which the UN and the United States had rejected calls for assistance with.\n\nThe report concluded that there had been errors of judgment pertaining to the Rwanda Armed Forces, but before the genocide only; further errors of judgment about the scale of the threat, at the onset of the genocide; over-reliance on the UNAMIR mission without awareness that it would be undercut by the United States and other parties; and ineffective diplomacy. Ultimately, it concluded that France had been the foreign power most involved in limiting the scale of the genocide once it got started, though it regretted that more had not been done.\n\nFollowing an investigation of the plane crash of April 6, 1994 that killed both the Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira and precipitated the genocide, and in which three French crew had also died, the French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière indicted nine associates of Rwandan president Paul Kagame in November 2006. President Kagame himself was not indicted, as he had immunity under French law as a head of state. Kagame denied the allegations, decrying them as politically motivated, and broke diplomatic relationships with France. He then ordered the formation of a commission of his own Rwandan Justice Ministry's employees that was officially \"charged with assembling proof of the involvement of France in the genocide\".\n\nIn testimony before the commission, Jacques Bihozagara, who was presented as \"former ambassador to France\", claimed that \"Operation Turquoise was aimed only at protecting genocide perpetrators, because the genocide continued even within the Turquoise zone.\" Beside misrepresenting the timeline of the mass killings in the Zone Turquoise, the implication of the testimony as conveyed to the foreign press was that Bihozagara had a sitting ambassador's insight into French policy at the time of the genocide. In fact, Bihozagara was a founding member of the RPF and close Kagame ally under whose watch as Minister of Rehabilitation the Kibeho Massacre occurred in 1995. His attitude and statements at that time led to reports that he had ordered that massacre, making him too much of a political liability for the RPF to keep as minister. Bihozagara was subsequently ambassador to Belgium, and then to France from September 2001 onwards; but in the intervening period Rwanda had closed its French embassy and purged personnel, precluding continuity of records.\n\nThe political character of that investigation was in turn further averred when the commission issued its report solely to Kagame – symbolically on November 17, 2007, exactly one year after Bruguière's announcement – and the head of the Rwandan commission, Jean de Dieu Mucyo, stated that the commission would now \"wait for President Kagame to declare whether the inquiry was valid.\" In July 2008, Kagame threatened to indict French nationals over the genocide if European courts did not withdraw arrest warrants issued against Rwandan officials, which by then included broader indictments against 40 Rwandan army officers by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu.\n\nFindings of the commission were released at Kagame's order on August 5, 2008. The report accused the French government of knowing of preparations for the genocide and helping to train the ethnic Hutu militia members; it accused 33 senior French military and political officials of involvement in the genocide, including then-President Mitterrand and his then general secretary Hubert Védrine, then-Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, then-Foreign Minister Alain Juppé, and his chief aide at the time, Dominique de Villepin.\n\nA statement accompanying the release claimed that \"French soldiers themselves directly were involved in assassinations of Tutsis and Hutus accused of hiding Tutsis ... French forces committed several rapes on Tutsi survivors\", though the latter was not documented in the report. A BBC report commented that French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, denied French responsibility in connection with the genocide but said that political errors had been made. Another BBC report delved into the motivations for the Rwandan report and stated that:\n\nChief among them has been an iron determination to keep the world's attention focused on the genocide, rather than on the role of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), the force that took power in 1994, bringing President Paul Kagame to power. In recent years uncomfortable questions have been raised about the war crimes the RPF are alleged to have committed during and after 1994. While stressing there can be no equation between genocide and war crimes, Alison Des Forges of Human Rights Watch says RPF leaders do have a case to answer. \"Their victims also deserve justice,\" she says.\n\nOn November 27, 2004 in a televised debate on France 3, after the showing of the French film \"Tuez les Tous\" (\"Kill Them All\"), created by three students of political science, the president of the parliamentary mission for information for Rwanda, former minister Paul Quilès stated that \"France asks to be pardoned by the people of Rwanda, but not by their government\".\n\nIn 2010, during a visit to Rwanda, French President Nicolas Sarkozy acknowledged that France made \"mistakes\" during the genocide, although, according to a BBC report, he \"stopped short of offering a full apology\".\n\nIn April 2016, 2017 conservative presidential candidate, Alain Juppé, who was also French foreign affairs minister during the 1994 genocide tweeted \"implicating France in the Rwandan genocide is a disgrace and a historical distortion.”\n"}
