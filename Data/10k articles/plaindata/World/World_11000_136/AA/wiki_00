Fisher that seeks to influence United States foreign policy by \"Promoting Peace Through Strength\". ASCF's current president is Dr. Henry A. Fischer. The ASCF was formed in 1958, and was originally known as the Institute for American Strategy. For over 50 years the Foundation has been focused on a wide range of educational programs which address critical challenges to U.S. foreign policy, national security, economic security and moral leadership of the United States of America. The ASCF headquarters is at 1250 24th Street NW, Suite 300.\n\nOn June 4, 1997 the American Security Council, a separate organization initiated in September 1954 by Robert E. Wood, retired chairman of Sears Roebuck and Company, was merged into the American Security Council Foundation.\nThe ASCF has received credit for developing programs and strategies that have been adopted as the foreign policy and national security strategy of the United States.\n\nThis mission was mentioned in the \"Guidelines for Cold War Victory\", a 1963 publication of the ASCF, and was additionally praised by former President Dwight Eisenhower in his radio address to the nation that was recorded at the ASCF’s request.\n\nIn 1978, the ASCF created the National Strategy for Peace Through Strength and the Peace Through Strength Coalition.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan credited the ASCF numerous times for providing the overall theme for the administration of his presidency. Former President Reagan acknowledged the ASCF on multiple occasions and claimed America won the Cold War by adhering to this doctrine. President Reagan remarked that, \"One thing is certain. If we're to continue to advance world peace and human freedom, America must remain strong. If we have learned anything these last eight years, it's that peace through strength works\". Paul Laxalt, Chairman of the Reagan for President Campaign and Senate Co-Chairman of the CPTS, wrote to John Fisher that, \"The Coalition's resolution calling for a national strategy for Peace through Strength became the defense strategy plank of the Republican Party Platform\". President Reagan said, \"I am particularly pleased that you also plan to involve members of congress, key administration officials and a wide range of private institutions in the further development of a national strategy of Peace Through Strength. This will be essential as a guide on how to spread democracy throughout the world. My administration will cooperate fully with you in this project\". While George H. W. Bush was vice president, President Reagan and John Fisher jointly presented Vice President Bush with the Gold Presidents Eagle Pin in recognition of strong support of the Peace Through Strength strategy. \n\nThe ASCF worked to have the United States government publish an official National Security Strategy. This was first implemented by President Reagan in 1985. All of his successors are legally required to produce a similar document that analyzes the security priorities and concerns of the nation.\n\n\n\n"}

The movement soon had several thousand members in the Northern occupation zone. \n\nIn early 1942, Roger Coquoin, a demobilized Captain and the head of the Chemistry Laboratory at the Académie Nationale de Médecine, met with the CDLL leader Maurice Ripoche.

Under Coquoin's command, the CDLL expanded to Paris and the rest of France, gathering new volunteers in Normandy, Champagne, Bourgogne and Vendée. Coquoin also made contact with other resistance movements in the occupied zone and even in the southern zone of Vichy. His capabilities in chemistry enabled him to develop detonators and abrasive pellets for destroying German trucks.

Working with poor communities, it trains people to deal with the effects of climate change and prepares them for the threat of natural disasters. These local organisations – or ‘partners’ – also work on HIV, training and education, health and sanitation and peace and reconciliation.\n\nIn 2007 the organisation encouraged people to plant trees in support of its overseas work on climate change projects. The charity aimed to raise £15.5 million from the annual fundraising week in 2007, and approximately 300,000 volunteers across the United Kingdom posted the well known red envelopes through millions of letterboxes.\n\nIn 2013, £12.6 million (or 13% percent of the total income) were raised during this week.\n\nIn 1945 the British and Irish churches establish the Christian Reconstruction in Europe. Its purpose is to raise funds for the resettlement of some of the millions of people left homeless by the war. \n\nIn 1948, it was renamed the Inter-Church Aid and Refugee Service, and became part of the British Council of Churches. During the next decade, the organisation began to move into worldwide development work. The overriding theme was the promotion of self-reliance.\n\nIn 1957, Janet Lacey, the organisation’s then director, decided to hold a “Christian Aid Week” to encourage public awareness. This first event mobilised residents in 200 towns and villages across Britain, collecting £26,000 for overseas development work.\n\nIn 1964 the agency changed its name to Christian Aid. During the 1960s, the threat of hunger, even famine, made agricultural development a priority in the poorest regions of the world, especially Africa and Asia. As well as overseas aid, Christian Aid began to tell Church supporters and schools about the causes of poverty and helped establish the World Development Movement.\n\n"}

Its task was to stabilize prices paid to peasant producers by funding operating losses incurred by Cotontchad, the parastatal giant that bought, ginned and sold all the cotton produced in Chad. The CSPC also played an important role in the program to improve yields: it is estimated that between 1971 and 1983 57% of all payments by the CSPC were made in conjunction with the program to improve cotton production. As for the funding of the CSPC, between 1971 and 1983, virtually all income to the CSPC derived from rebates paid by Cotontchad into the system. After 1984 the sharply reduced income of Cotontchad made the system for paying the producers heavily dependent on external sources of funds (such as Stabex), while the government completely exempted Cotontchad from the rebates to the CSPC. The difficulties of the CSPC, whose staffs had already been considerably reduced in the late 1980s, came to a head with the great recession that hit the cotton market between 1991 and 1993, leading to the abolition of the board in 1993. It was decided to let the prices paid to the producers fluctuate freely, following the international price of cotton.\n"}

According to this model, the Eurasian continent is composed of three regions; in addition to Western Europe and the Far East, a third region called the \"Intermediate Region\" found between the two constitutes a distinct civilization. It roughly covers Eastern Europe and the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nThe lands between the Adriatic Sea and the Indus River form the Intermediate Region and are considered a bridge between Western and Eastern civilisations. The vast area extends from the eastern half of Europe to the western half of Asia. Its significance is that there is neither a uniform Europe nor a uniform Asia. Europe and Asia denote geographical regions, not civilisations.\n\nDemographically, the region's dominant religions are Orthodox Christianity and Sunni Islam, and Shiite Islam, with Alevism and Judaism to a lesser extent. In contrast, Catholicism and Protestantism dominate in the West, and Hinduism and Buddhism dominate in the East.\n\nThe Intermediate Region had, for 2500 years, been dominated by an ecumenical empire whose centre lay by the Turkish Straits and the Aegean Sea. It was fundamentally the same empire throughout history, and its successive leaders sought to unify its respective peoples. From the Persian Empire of Darius the Great, it fell into the hands of Alexander the Great, then to the Hellenistic Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, and finally the Sunni Ottoman Empire until 1923–1924, even though originally the Ottoman Dynasty was Alevo. That is why the Janissaries followed the Bektashi-Alevi religion. This Central Empire had been subject to attempts by other empires to seize succession, situated along its periphery, the Caliphate, the Persian Empire and the Russian Empire (until 1917).\n\nThe dynamic between the Central Empire and the Peripheral Empires constitutes an internal conflict in the Intermediate Region. Each of the main peoples in this area struggled to seize control of its centre of influence, that is, Byzantium-Constantinople-Istanbul, which remained the undisputed focal point for nearly 2000 years. The Arabs, in the 8th century, and the Russians, in the 20th century, almost succeeded in doing so but were not able to take control of the ecumenical empire. Western intervention, since the 18th century, is considered to be an external conflict, which sought not succession but the destruction of the ecumenical empire and its dismemberment (Balkanisation) and its subjection to the stranglehold of Westernisation.\n\nKitsikis concludes that “due to historical events spanning thousands of years, the Eurasian continent, of which Europe is but one of its peninsulas, comprises three civilisational areas: a) the West, which today includes the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as Western Europe; b) the East or “Far East”, which includes the peninsulas of India, Southeast Asia (with Indonesia) and China (with Korea and Japan); c) the Intermediate Region, which is found both in the East and the West.”\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36034963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36034963", "title": "March to Modernity", "text": "March to Modernity\n\nThe March to Modernity, coined by Kishore Mahbubani in his book, \"The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East\", refers to Asia's modernization using and adapting the seven pillars of Western ideology to cause Asia’s rise to become the new global power. Asia’s modernity was first achieved by Japan and India. Japan's success was emulated by the four economic tigers: South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. China followed soon after by launching it’s \"Four Modernizations\" program. China's past three decades success in turn inspired the rise of India. Asians are marching to modernity.\n\nKishore Mahbubani used the term in his book, \"The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East\". March to Modernity indicates the first and most likely of the three possible scenarios of Asia's modernization in the globalization era. Mahbubani discusses how the rise of Asia will alter the world between the East and the West in the next fifty years. He argues that the modernizing Asia will be good for the whole world in ethical as well as political terms. The West (primarily America), a pioneer of the globalization and modernization, has triggered Asian modernization. The desire of Asian states are simply to follow, not to dominate West, which refers to rather the triumph of the West. However, many Western leaders made remarks defining the coming world of rising Asia as dangerous or challenging. (President Bush in 2006, French minister of foreign affairs Barnier in 2005 etc.) This conception is out-dated. The Asian March to Modernity represents a new opportunity both for the West and for the world.\n\nKishore Mahububani’s main argument and first scenario is when the March to Modernity succeeds, the world would become more peaceful, stable and prosperous.\n\nMahbubani’s first argument is that the March to Modernity will have a positive co-relational relationship in which modernization of material gains will cause Asia to experience a positive psychological boost. By gaining access to the modernization of these three basic human basic needs (shelter, water, electricity), the poor of the Asian hemisphere will experience a boost in hope for a better life. Mahbubani uses the example of India’s recent liberalization and shows that in the past decade poor, rural Indians feel more hopeful due to the increase in modernization. The satisfied people will also as stated by Mahbubani have a greater sense of self-dignity. Taking South Korea for example, people feel more liberated and full of hope for the future because they have numerous choices and several possibilities to choose from.\n\nSecond, entering the modern universe inevitably leads to a greater adherence to the rule of law will occur. Muhbani argues this point by explaining that through increase of material wealth a greater presence of law will occur, thus creating a sense of ownership and certainty. Through democratization, empowered humans will become responsible in setting world history in a positive direction due to the belief that they have the ability to control their destiny. Lastly Mahbubani explains that the March to Modernity will also lead to a more ethical universe. More population will be out of absolute poverty followed by social benefits such as improvements in health and education standards and decrease in crime rates. For instance, ideas of Western secular education that emphasizes economy and society are taught in China while the pages of socialism ideas are reduced. According to Mahbubani, the Chinese government spends more money and effort on child education with a heavy bias towards science and technology. However a decade ago, previous education focused on Chinese dynasties and communist revolution rather than globalization. Adopting free-market economy not only gave China progression in economic activity as well as liberated the minds of Chinese people. Muhbubani believes that the success of North America and the European Union was caused by the middle class who are reluctant to sacrifice their comfortable life due to warfare. When disputes between individuals and societies emerge, they would be settled on the basis of agreed rules and procedures, not by warfare. According to Larry Summers, “there can be no personal freedom without personal security”. Therefore, the March to Modernity creates a more secure world due to adherence to rules and order.\n\n'\"Examples of Economic Prosperity in Asia\"'\n\n• Modernization of China and India has succeeded in reducing the number of people in absolute poverty.\n\n• Spread of Cell phone users in India has changed Indian mindset on modern instruments. This “mobile miracle” empowered the less fortunate to fight poverty and to be connected to global economy. Cell phones are now connecting the World’s poor to the global economy, which leads to higher productivity.\n\nExamples of Political Stability in Asia\n\n• China has responded actively to the call of World Bank to become a \"responsible stakeholder\" of international order (Sept. 2005)\n\n• Most Asian countries want to take responsible parts in the open multilateral international order.\n\nScenario 2: The Retreat into Fortresses\n\nIn the second scenario, Mubuhbani believes that the Western hemisphere, will become threatened by Asia's success. Thus, the West will engaged in rigid protectionism to halt Asia’s rising status. However Muhbani explains that Europe has engaged in protectionist techniques since the end of the Cold War. These strategies includes massive subsidies to the wealthy few in Europe and using tax payers’ dollars on unnecessary language translations. Although the European Union’s protectionist policies has not hindered the overall growth of the global economy, according to David Hale, a Wall Street Journalist,“the greatest threat to this [global] boom is that the United States will lose confidence in the free market ideology\". Protectionism is also happening in the investment sector of global politics. The United States has backed out of foreign investment due to the concern of national security issues. Paul Krugman, one of America’s leading economist acknowledges that free trade is not universally benefit in that there will be some winners and some losers. However the World Bank, states that countries that engaged in free trade will actually see a rise in their economies as well due to the laws of comparative advantage.\n\nScenario 3: The Triumph of the West\nThe Triumph of the West is the last scenario presented by Muhbani. The West, having positioned itself as a superpower after the Cold War, westernization will increase thus causing all other nations to adopt Western values and become \"cultural clones of the West.\".\n\nThis argument was elaborated by Francis Fukuyama in his book \"The End of History\" arguing for the \"end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalisation of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\" Mahbubani contends that three fundamental flaws exists in this scenario.\n\nThe first flaw is the belief that the West had triumphed over the Soviet Union because of its values and political system. Mahbubani illustrates it was the economic system that led to Western triumph, and the success of China and the failure of Soviet Union reveal the flaw of the argument. Deng Xiaoping focused on introducing free-market economics to China by correctly understanding the source of Western strength, while Gorbachev focused on glasnost (political openness) over perestroika (economic restructuring). In other words, Gorbachev's failure to realise the power of Western economic system led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe belief that \"any society anywhere in the world at any state of social and economic development could be immediately transformed overnight into a liberal democracy\" is the second flaw of the Western triumphalist thesis. The author points out that everywhere else apart from the East European countries, which shared common history and culture with Western Europe, democratization failed. He offers the example of Balkans to argue that \"without the right institutions and political culture, long-smoldering ethnic, religious, and nationalistic sentiments in many countries can be whipped up my opportunistic damagogues\", leading to failure in transition to democracy. Although democratic elections were held in Croatia and Serbia, instead of liberal democrats, nationalist demagogues were elected. The leaders then appealed to visceral nationalist sentiments to retain their power, which led to war. Unprepared democratisation can also lead to ethnic conflicts, as the examples of ethnic cleansing of Croats in parts of the former Yugoslavia, the attacks on the Chinese minority in Indonesia, and the Tutsi slaughter in Rwanda illustrate.\n\nLastly, disregarding cultural differences because of the belief that Western liberal democratic society is universally applicable to all societies is another flaw in the triumphant post-Cold War thesis. Mahbubani claims cultures are different and failing to see this shows generosity but also arrogance of the West. The author asserts that there is nothing superior about the Western values, rather, other dormant cultures simply underwent revival of cultural confidence and dynamism when the West was experiencing one of its most triumphant moments.\nBased on the flaws, Kishore Mahbubani argues that this scenario is least likely to happen in the future.\n\nIn his book, \"The New Asian Hemisphere,\" Kishore Mahbubani explains seven pillars of Western wisdom that have contributed to Asia's march to modernity:\n\nKishore Mahbubani suggests two significant cases of Asia's modernity; China and India.\n\nAccording to 'The China Modernization Report', China measures its modernization level with two assessment criteria; first stage, \"industrialization and urbanization\" and second stage, a \"knowledge-driven and information-driven\" society. The 2007 China Modernization Report predicts that by 2015, China will have reached modernization \"to the level of developed nations in 1960\".\n\nThe mobile phone revolution in India shows how \"just one modern instrument\" impact modernization. It is not just spread of mobile but spread of communication and information.\n\n\n\n"}

The station is a service of the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Inc., which also operates Alhurra Television and is publicly funded by the Broadcasting Board of Governors and the U.S. Congress. The word \"sawa\" (, ) means \"together\" in many spoken Arabic dialects.\n\nPreexisting attitudes and concurrent reality of opinions towards the United States led to the creation of Radio Sawa. It seeks to effectively communicate with the youthful population of Arabic-speakers in the Middle East. The station's goal is to promote pro-American attitudes to youth in the Arab world. Radio Sawa's first broadcast was on March 23, 2002. Its newscasts are broadcast live on air from its studios in Washington, DC and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Radio Sawa also has news bureaus and reporters throughout the Middle East.\n\nRadio Sawa and its sister-network, Al Hurra TV, are part of a larger U.S. Public Diplomacy effort in the Middle East. Their stated mission is to \"improve America's image in the Middle East and win the hearts and minds of the Arab people.\"\n\nRadio Sawa was first launched on 23 March 2002, initially in Jordan, West Bank, Kuwait, UAE (Abu Dhabi), Qatar and Bahrain and eventually in the rest of the Arab World (see below for full list).\n\nRadio Sawa replaced Voice of America's Arabic service, which had not been successful in attracting large audiences. The initiator of Radio Sawa is American media mogul Norman Pattiz. He found that more than 60% of the Arab population was under the age of 30, which is why he decided to develop programming that would target the younger generation. Pattiz believed that the best way to reach the young people was with music. This is why the majority of the radio's programming consists of American and Arab pop music.\n\nRadio Sawa is controlled by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), the Federal agency responsible for all U.S. international civilian broadcasting. The BBG founded the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN), a non-profit news and information organization, to run Radio Sawa and Al Hurra TV.\n\nRadio Sawa is a United States Congress-funded public relations endeavor that has enjoyed significant recent popularity in the Middle East.\n\nIn contrast to the Voice of America radio broadcasts in the region which it replaced, Radio Sawa blends news with contemporary music, arts and lifestyle and other light programming. Radio Sawa's programming consists of roughly 20–25% news and 75–80% pop songs.\n\nApart from songs, most other content is presented in the rubric \"The World Now,\" which includes news, interviews, sports, etc.\n\nThe station's playlist includes popular Arabic (Middle Eastern), English (mostly American hits) and Spanish (mostly Latin American) songs so as to attract the Arabic listener.\n\nThere are also occasional specials.\n\nRadio Sawa has been subject to criticism from various observers, who question its effectiveness in conveying America's message to the Arab world. Radio Sawa is commonly seen as terms of a solution to public relations crisis during the time of its launch as a form of public diplomacy, 'suggesting by implication that American media efforts do have the power to transform opinion if only implemented in a different form'.\n\nA study published in 2006, which surveyed college students at universities in five Arab countries, found that the students' attitudes towards U.S. foreign policy had actually worsened since they started listening to Radio Sawa and watching Al Hurra TV\n\nRadio Sawa has also been criticized for its poor quality control and for its resistance to any outside review of its programming.\n\nA 2004 draft report prepared by the State Department's inspector general was severely critical of the station. Experts cited in the report concluded that \"Radio Sawa failed to present America to its audience.\"\n\nThe station's emphasis on popular music has led critics to question if music alone is enough to convey America's message. Some critics point out that what matters is \"not just how many people are tuning in, but how many people are affected by a broadcast's content.\"\n\nRadio Sawa is broadcast free across the region, using a combination of:\n\nAlongside the mainstream Radio Sawa broadcasts, there are various regional streams targeted to specific regions/countries which are also available online:\n\nNames of the cities next to them the broadcast frequency of FM in MHz.\n\n\n"}

Rostislav Stratimirovic — a descendant of the medieval Shishman dynasty decided to exploit the international situation, established relations with the Russian Patriarch Joachim and visited Moscow in preparation for the uprising. In his absence the uprising burst prematurely and was doomed. He quickly returned to Tarnovo where he was proclaimed Prince of Bulgaria after the city was briefly liberated, with about 4,000 people gathering.\n\nHowever, the Ottoman authorities reacted immediately and quickly recaptured the city using regular army, brutally suppressing the uprising. Rostislav Stratimirovic fled the Ottoman territory and settled in Russia where he married the niece of the patriarch – Maria Dubrovska.\n\nThe only source about the uprising (and the very existence of Rostislav Statimirovic) is the family chronicles of Rostislavich-Dubrovsky clan, now missing.
