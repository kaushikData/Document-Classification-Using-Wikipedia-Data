The field includes the study of the region's culture, written language, history, and political institutions. East Asian Studies is located within the broader field of Asian studies and is also interdisciplinary in character, incorporating elements of the social sciences (anthropology, economics, sociology, politics etc.) and humanities (literature, history, art, film, music, etc.), among others. The field encourages scholars from diverse disciplines to exchanges ideas on scholarship as it relates to the East Asian experience and the experience of East Asia in the world. In addition, the field encourages scholars to educate others to have a deeper understanding of, and appreciation and respect for, all that is East Asia and, therefore, to promote peaceful human integration worldwide.\n\nAt universities throughout North America and the Western World, the study of East Asian Humanities is traditionally housed in EALC (\"East Asian Languages and Civilizations\" or \"Cultures\") departments, which run majors in Chinese and Japanese Language and Literature, and sometimes Korean Language and Literature. East Asian Studies programs, on the other hand, are typically interdisciplinary centers that bring together literary scholars, historians, anthropologists, sociologists, political scientists, etc. from their various departments and schools to promote instructional programs, conferences, and lecture series of common interest. East Asian Studies centers also often run interdisciplinary undergraduate and master's degree programs in East Asian Studies.\n\nThe sub-field dedicated to China, Chinese history Chinese culture, Chinese literature and the Chinese language. In the context of the Republic of China also specified as Taiwan studies (Academia Sinica).\n\nThe sub-field dedicated to Japan, Japanese culture, Japanese history, Japanese literature and the Japanese language. The foundation of the Asiatic Society of Japan at Yokohama in 1872 by men such as Ernest Satow and Frederick Victor Dickins was an important event in the development of Japanese studies as an academic discipline.\n\nThe sub-field dedicated to Korea, Korean culture, Korean history, Korean literature, and the Korean language. The term Korean studies first began to be used in the 1940s, but did not attain widespread currency until South Korea rose to economic prominence in the 1970s. In 1991, the South Korean government established the Korea Foundation to promote Korean studies.\n\nThe sub-field dedicated to Mongolia, Mongolian culture, Mongolian literature and the Mongolian language. Mongolian studies are also presented as a sub-field of the study of Inner Asia (as opposed to East Asia). The American Center for Mongolian Studies was founded in 2002.\n\nIn universities across the United States, as part of the opposition to the Vietnam War in the 1960s, younger faculty and graduate students criticized the field for complicity in what they saw as American imperialism. In particular, the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars debated and published alternative approaches not centered in the United States or funded, as many American programs were, by the American government or major foundations. They charged that Japan was held up as a model of non-revolutionary modernization and the field focused on modernization theory in order to fend off revolution. \n\nIn the following decades, many critics were inspired by Edward Said's 1978 book \"Orientalism\", while others, writing from the point of view of the quantitative or theoretical social sciences, saw area studies in general and East Asian studies in particular, as amorphous and lacking in rigor.\n\nCritiques were also mounted from other points in the political spectrum. Ramon H. Myers and Thomas A. Metzger, two scholars based at the generally conservative Hoover Institution, charged that \"the 'revolution' paradigm increasingly overshadowed the 'modernization' paradigm\" and \"this fallacy has become integral to much of the writing on modern Chinese history\", discrediting or ignoring other factors in the history of modern China.\n\nIn Europe, notable scholars of East Asian studies have long occupied professorships at prominent universities in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, France and Italy, while recent publications also suggest that the “Nordic countries offer some unique contributions in the field of East Asian studies.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8084104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8084104", "title": "Etiquette in Europe", "text": "Etiquette in Europe\n\nEtiquette in Europe is not uniform. Even within the regions of Europe, etiquette may not be uniform: within a single country there may be differences in customs, especially where there are different linguistic groups, as in Switzerland where there are French, German and Italian speakers.\n\nDespite this heterogeneity, many points of etiquette have spread through Europe and many features are shared. The ancient Roman Empire is a historical source, and the cosmopolitan royalty and also nobility were effective in spreading etiquette throughout Europe. For example, in the Palace of Versailles, where French nobility was concentrated, a complicated etiquette was developed.\n\nIt is never acceptable to write an anonymous letter or one that purports to be signed by somebody other than the writer (but does not make that clear).\n\nMany languages use different 2nd person pronouns to denote formality or familiarity when addressing people (the T–V distinction). This also applies in common phrases such as \"How are you?\". The use of an inappropriately familiar form may be seen as derogatory, insulting or even aggressive. Conversely, forms that are inappropriately formal may be seen as impolitely snobbish or distant.\n\nThe way politeness is expressed varies greatly with language and region. For example, addressing a person with an honorific or title may be expected in some languages, but seen as intrusive or too formal in others.\n\nIn many parts of Europe, using someone's first name also denotes a certain level of friendship. In social interactions with strangers, the last name and/or more formal mode of address is used, usually until the people involved agree to move to an informal level. However, this may not apply among young people, among members of particular groups (e.g. students) or in informal settings. Also among countries that border each other vast differences can be noticed in the use of titles, first names and pronounces, as is the case in the Netherlands compared with Belgium and Germany.\n\nIn some countries, such as in Italy, chrysanthemums are given only at funerals. In France, red roses are given to the beloved person when the giver is in love. In Finland, the same applies except that school leavers are often given red roses on passing their matriculation examination (abitur).\n\nAmong many segments of the European population, for example, in the United Kingdom, it is considered impolite to wear a hat or other head covering indoors, especially in churches, schools, private homes and respected public institutions. In churches, however, ladies may be exempt from this rule.\n\nWearing coats, boots or other outer garments inside someone’s home is often frowned upon as well. Sitting down to eat at table wearing a hat or coat etc. is even worse. Also one should remove one's hat when showing deference. Removing one's hat is also a form of respectful greeting: the origin of this is that knights were expected to remove their helmets when meeting their king; not doing so would be a sign of mistrust and hostility.\n\nTalking or asking about one's personal wealth, possessions or success in business is widely viewed as vulgar. People will rarely say how much money they make or have in the bank nor will they request such information from someone else. It is impolite to ask colleagues about their salary and in some places of work it is forbidden. Even elsewhere, for example where government employees' salaries are publicly known, it is still considered extremely rude to ask individuals how much they earn.\n\nIn Europe, what qualifies as indecent exposure includes generally at least the exposure of genitalia or anus. In case of women, exposing nipples is not seen as proper conduct, but this is not always considered criminal, and depends on individual countries' nudity laws. For the issue of breastfeeding babies in public, see \"Breastfeeding in public\". The intentional exposure of bare buttocks towards someone, mooning, is a deliberate insult. However, public nudity may be allowed in some circumstances, which vary by country. Within Dutch society nudity is less sexualized as in for example the English-speaking world and resembles more the views of other Northern European cultures, as can be seen in the sauna customs. In saunas, the rules about nudity vary according to the country. On nudist beaches, multigender saunas and in the changing rooms of swimming pools in some countries, keeping one's clothes on is frowned upon. Here it is good manners to undress.\n\n"}

The distinguishing feature is that a faster rate of upward-flow velocity is designed for the wastewater passing through the sludge bed. The increased flux permits partial expansion (fluidisation) of the granular sludge bed, improving wastewater-sludge contact as well as enhancing segregation of small inactive suspended particle from the sludge bed. The increased flow velocity is either accomplished by utilizing tall reactors, or by incorporating an effluent recycle (or both). A scheme depicting the EGSB design concept is shown in this EGSB diagram.\n\nThe EGSB design is appropriate for low strength soluble wastewaters (less than 1 to 2 g soluble COD/l) or for wastewaters that contain inert or poorly biodegradable suspended particles which should not be allowed to accumulate in the sludge bed.\n\n"}

During the 1950s many Gharmis were forced to migrate from central Tajikistan to the Vakhsh River Valley in western Tajikistan. Gharmis were in large excluded from government positions which were dominated by individuals from Khujand and Kulob. Gharmis who settled in Qurghonteppa Oblast are frequently described as a clan group that found social niches in education and the marketplace.\n\nAfter Tajikistan became independent in 1991, many Gharmis participated in protests against the government. When the Civil War of Tajikistan broke out in 1992 a large number of Gharmis joined the DPT-IRP opposition. The organization Human Rights Watch among others, reported that Gharmis were targeted for execution, disappearances, mass killings, and Gharmi villages were burnt. During the fall and winter of 1992 as many as 90,000 Gharmis and Pamiris were expelled from their homes and found refugee in Afghanistan in a campaign described by the United States Department of State as a pogrom. This was followed by heavy fighting in the Rasht Valley between government and opposition forces that led to the destruction of villages.

Segrave, who set three land and one water record, was the first person to hold both titles simultaneously and the first person to travel at over in a land vehicle. He died in an accident in 1930 shortly after setting a new world water speed record on Windermere in the Lake District, England. The Segrave Trophy was established to commemorate his life.\n\nSegrave, who was a British national, was born on 22 September 1896 in Baltimore, Maryland to an American mother and an Irish father. He was raised in Ireland and attended Eton College in England.\n\nIn 1914 he gained a commission in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. In January 1916 he joined the Royal Flying Corps where he served as a fighter pilot (he retained his commission in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment). He sustained wounds in 1915 and 1916. Segrave became a flight commander as a temporary captain in July 1916. After the war, he transferred to the Royal Air Force Administrative Branch in 1919 but soon resigned his commission due to his war injuries.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the war, British motor manufacturers were starting to build more reliable and faster vehicles. Although motor racing was in its infancy, Segrave would soon become a championship winning driver.\n\nIn 1921 Segrave won the first long-distance car race to be run in Britain. The 200-mile Race, which was organised by the Junior Car Club for 1,500 c.c. light cars, was held at Brooklands in Surrey. Segrave won in a Darracq-made Talbot that were marketed as Talbot-Darracqs. In the same year Segrave competed in his first ever French Grand Prix, Darracq was reorganised as part of the S.T.D. Motors conglomerate. To impress Breton automobile designer, Louis Coatalen, in order to gain a place in the formidable Sunbeam-Talbot-Darrac Works team, Segrave, changed fourteen covers on his Talbot, a rebadged highly advanced straight eight dual overhead camshaft (dohc) 1921 Sunbeam Grand Prix. In the 1922 1922 French Grand Prix, Segrave was forced to retire in his Grand Prix Sunbeams 1922 because of chemical burns.\n\nWhen he won the 1923 French Grand Prix in a Sunbeam, he became the first Briton to win a Grand Prix in a British car. In 1924 he won the San Sebastian Grand Prix at Circuito Lasarte (Spain). After a further win at Miramas in France, he retired from racing to concentrate on speed records.\n\nOn 16 March 1926, Segrave set his first land speed record of using \"Ladybird\", a 4-litre Sunbeam Tiger on Ainsdale beach at Southport, England. This record was broken a month later by J.G. Parry-Thomas driving Babs, a custom-built car with a 27-litre V12 Liberty aero engine.\n\nA year later he became the first person to travel over when he regained the land speed record at the Daytona Beach Road Course on 29 March 1927. Using \"Mystery\" (but also known as 'the Slug'), a 1000 HP Sunbeam, he recorded a speed of .\n\nOn 11 March 1929, Segrave set his final land speed record again at Daytona Beach. Using a new car designed for him by Captain Jack Irving and named the \"Golden Arrow\" he set a new record of . Segrave never attempted another land speed record after witnessing the high-speed death of American racing driver, Lee Bible, who was trying to set a new land speed record on March 13, 1929, at Ormond Beach, Florida. The \"Golden Arrow\", which was never used again, has only on the clock. The vehicle is on display along with Segrave's Sunbeam 350HP and Sunbeam 1000 hp at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu.\n\nOn the 90th anniversary of Segrave setting his first historic record, his original Sunbeam racing car returned to Southport where it was driven down Ainsdale beach in March 2016.\n\nSegrave had \"Miss England I\" built in 1928, in an attempt to retrieve the Harmsworth Trophy from the American Gar Wood whose series of high-powered aero-engines driven \"Miss America\" boats had made him a multiple water speed record holder and the first man to travel over on water. Although Segrave had already used aero-engines in some of his land-speed record setting vehicles, \"Miss England I\" used a single Napier Lion engine. Instead Segrave believed the boat's speed would come from its advanced lightweight planing-hull design. Wood - along with other American boat designers - thought the design was too flimsy for the speeds. Wood sportingly offered to help Segrave, particularly sharing his experiences in propeller and rudder design.\n\nAfter his 1929 land speed record, Segrave immediately went to Miami for his speedboat race with Wood which he won. It was the American's first defeat in nine years. After Segrave returned to Britain, he was knighted for his many accomplishments.\n\nOn Friday 13 June 1930, a few months after receiving his knighthood, Segrave drove \"Miss England II\" to a new record of average over two runs on Windermere. However, on the third run the boat capsized at full speed. Chief engineer Victor Halliwell was killed by the boat rolling over on him as it crashed. Mechanic Michael \"Jack\" Willcocks survived with a broken arm after being thrown from the craft. Segrave, who was rescued unconscious as the boat sank, regained consciousness for a moment and asked about the fate of \"his men\". Shortly after being told that he had broken the record he died from acute lung hemorrhages. Although a large floating branch was discovered near the crash, there has been no definitive cause for the accident. Other theories include the boat's construction. Concerns were raised that its hull was too light in design and construction, particularly around the craft hydroplane which was found partially detached after the crash.\n\nKaye Don subsequently broke two more world water speed records in \"Miss England II\".\n\nWhen Segrave's interest in flying returned in the late 1920s he designed an aircraft for luxury touring. The prototype, known as the Saro Segrave Meteor was a wooden twin-engined monoplane. It first flew on 28 May 1930. However, development was delayed due to Segrave's death a month later.

{"id": "31990704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31990704", "title": "Monarchies of Malaysia", "text": "Monarchies of Malaysia\n\nThe monarchies of Malaysia refer to the constitutional monarchy system as practised in Malaysia. The political system of Malaysia is based on the Westminster parliamentary system with the features of a federation.\n\nNine of the states of Malaysia are constitutionally headed by traditional Malay rulers. The nine states are collectively referred to as the \"Malay States\". State constitutions limit eligibility for the thrones to male Malay muslims of royal descent. Seven are hereditary monarchies based on agnatic primogeniture; they are Kedah, Kelantan, Johor, Perlis, Pahang, Selangor and Terengganu. In Perak, the throne rotates among three branches of the royal family loosely based on agnatic seniority. One state, Negeri Sembilan, is an elective monarchy; the ruler is elected from male members of the royal family by hereditary chiefs. All rulers except those of Perlis and Negeri Sembilan use the title \"Sultan\". The ruler of Perlis is styled \"Raja\", while the ruler of Negeri Sembilan is known as \"Yang Di Pertuan Besar\".\n\nEvery five years or when a vacancy occurs, the rulers convene in the Conference of Rulers () to elect among themselves the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the federal constitutional monarch and head of state of Malaysia. As the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected among the rulers, Malaysia as a whole is also an elective monarchy.\n\nEach of the nine rulers serves as the head of state of his own state, as well as the head of the religion of Islam in his state. As with other constitutional monarchs around the world, the rulers do not participate in the actual governance in their states; instead, each of them is bound by convention to act on the advice of the head of government of his state, known as Menteri Besar (pl. Menteri-menteri Besar). However, the ruler of each state has discretionary powers in appointing the Menteri Besar that commands a majority in the state legislative assembly, and refusing a dissolution of the state assembly when requested by the Menteri Besar.\n\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong is the federal head of state. His symbolic roles include being the Commander-in-Chief of the Malaysian Armed Forces, and carrying out diplomatic functions such as receiving foreign diplomats and representing Malaysia on state visits. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong is the head of Islam in his own state, the four states without rulers (Penang, Malacca, Sabah and Sarawak) and the Federal Territories. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong is required to delegate all his state powers to a regent, except for the role of head of Islam. Similar to other rulers, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong acts on the advice of the Prime Minister, and has discretionary powers in appointing the Prime Minister that commands a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of the Parliament, and refusing a dissolution of the Parliament. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong also appoints the Yang di-Pertua Negeri, the ceremonial governors for the four states without rulers, on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Chief Ministers of the states.\n\nA unique feature of the constitutional monarchy in Malaysia is the Conference of Rulers, consisting of the nine rulers and the four Yang di-Pertua Negeris. The Conference convenes triannually to discuss various issues related to state and national policies. The most important role of the Conference is to elect the Yang di-Pertuan Agong every five years or when a vacancy occurs. Only the rulers participate in the election of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, as well as discussions related to rulers' privileges and religious observances. The Conference's other role in the federal governance of the country is to give consent to amendments of certain entrenched provisions of the federal constitution, namely those pertaining to the status of the rulers, the special privileges of the Bumiputra, the status of the Malay language as the national language, and the status of Islam as the religion of the federation.\n\nHistorically, various Malay kingdoms flourished on the Malay peninsula. The earliest kingdoms were influenced by Hindu culture, the most notable being Langkasuka in present-day Kedah. In the 15th century, the Malacca Sultanate became the dominant power on the peninsula. The Malacca Sultanate was the first Malay Muslim state based on the peninsula that was also a real regional maritime power. After the fall of Malacca in 1511, several local rulers emerged in the northern part of the peninsula which later fell under Siamese influence, while two princes of the Malaccan royal family founded Johor and Perak respectively. The Sultanate of Johor emerged as the dominant power on the peninsula. The vast territory of Johor led to some areas gaining autonomy, which gradually developed into independent states.\n\nIn the 19th century, as various infighting among the Malay aristocracy threatened British economic interests in the region, the British began a policy of intervention. The British concluded treaties with some Malay states, installing “residents” as advisors to the rulers, who soon became the \"de facto\" ruling powers of their states. These residents held power in everything except in religion affairs and Malay customs. In 1895, the governance of Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak and Selangor were combined as the Federated Malay States, headed by a Resident General based in Kuala Lumpur. The British wrestled Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu from Siamese influence, and in turn they each received a British \"advisor\". Johor was the last state to succumb to British pressure, receiving an advisor in 1914. These five states were known as the Unfederated Malay States.\n\nIn 1946, after World War II, the British combined the Federated Malay States and the Unfederated Malay States, together with two of the Straits Settlements, Penang and Malacca, to form the Malayan Union which was headed by a British governor. Under the terms of the Union, the Malay rulers conceded all their powers to the British Crown except in religious matters. Widespread opposition by Malay nationalists led to the reform of Malayan Union to become the Federation of Malaya in 1948, in which the rulers were restored to their symbolic role as heads of state.\n\nThe present form of constitutional monarchy in Malaysia dates from 1957, when the Federation of Malaya gained independence. The rulers serve as constitutional heads of their states, with the state executive powers exercised by state governments elected by the people. The rulers elect among themselves a federal head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, with the federal executive powers exercised by an elected federal government. The form of constitutional monarchy was retained when Malaysia was formed in 1963.\n\nAccording to the \"Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa\", the Kingdom of Kedah was founded around 630 CE by Maharaja Derbar Raja, who arrived from Gameroon, Persia. The Sultanate of Kedah was founded when the last Hindu king, Phra Ong Mahawangsa, converted to Islam in 1136. He took the name Sultan Mudzafar Shah. Sultan Mudzafar's descendants continue to rule Kedah today.\n\nThe seat of the Sultan of Kedah is Anak Bukit.\n\nAfter centuries of subordination by Majapahit, Malacca, Siam and Terengganu, Long Muhammad, son of Long Yunus, declared himself Sultan in 1800 and gained recognition as a tributary by the Siamese. Control over Kelantan was transferred to the British under the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909.\n\nThe state capital, Kota Bharu, also serves as the royal city. The main palace for ceremonial functions is Istana Balai Besar, while Istana Negeri serves as the current sultan's residence. The previous sultan, who is still living, resides at Istana Mahkota.\n\nThe early Sultans of Johor claimed to be a continuation of the Malacca Sultanate. The first Sultan, Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II was the son of the last Sultan of Malacca, who reigned from 1528. In the 19th century, with support from the British, the Temenggong family gained recognition as rulers of the state. Its first sultan, Maharaja Abu Bakar is known as the founder of \"modern Johor\". His descendants rule the state today.\n\nThe Sultan of Johor resides in the capital, Johor Bahru.\n\nNegeri Sembilan's monarchy incorporates a form of federalism, whereby the state is divided into smaller \"luak\" (chiefdoms), each with a ruling \"undang\" (chieftain). Four of the major chieftains elect the Yang di-Pertuan Besar (Yam Tuan Besar), who is the Head of State of Negeri Sembilan.\n\nThe first Yam Tuan Besar was Raja Melewar, who united the nine small states of Negeri Sembilan, each of which were ruled by a local chieftain. He was sent from the Pagaruyung Kingdom at the request of the Minangkabau nobility in the nine small states in the Malay Peninsula in the 18th century. Raja Melewar was succeeded by other princes sent from Pagaruyung, whose sons did not inherit the throne until Raja Raden in 1831, who was the son of Raja Lenggang.\n\nThe seat of the Yam Tuan Besar is Seri Menanti.\n\nChieftains are selected among the nobility in each Luak, following matrilineal inheritance, part of the state's \"Adat perpatih\" customs. The Undang of Sungai Ujong is chosen among the Waris Hulu and Waris Hilir families, and inherits the title \"Dato' Klana Petra\". The Undang of Jelebu is elected among the four noble houses, Waris Jelebu, Waris Ulu Jelebu, Waris Sarin and Waris Kemin. Undang of Johol are a succession of members of two families in the female line which are Perut Gemencheh and Perut Johol. The son of the eldest sister of the incumbent is usually the heir. The Undang of Rembau alternates between the two major noble houses in the Luak, namely the Waris Jakun (who inherit the title \"Dato' Lela Maharaja\") and the Waris Jawa (\"Dato' Sedia di-Raja\"). As with the undangs of Johol, the son of the eldest sister of the incumbent is the heir in the family.\n\nIn addition, the district of Tampin has its own hereditary ruler, known as the Tunku Besar. The Tunku Besars of Tampin are descendants of Sharif Sha'aban Syed Ibrahim al-Qadri, the son-in-law of Raja Ali, a member of the state royal family who challenged the reign of the Yang di-Pertuan Besar in the early 19th century.\n\nThe modern royal house of Pahang is a branch of the royal family of Johor. They held the title of Bendahara. In 1853, the Bendahara, Tun Muhammad Tahir, broke away from the Johor sultan and declared the state of Pahang independent. He was later deposed by his brother Ahmad, who declared himself Sultan in 1884.\n\nThe Sultan of Pahang resides in Pekan.\n\nSyed Hussein Jamalullail, the sons of Syed Abu Bakar Jamalullail, the chief of Arau, and a daughter of Sultan Dziaddin of Kedah, was recognised as Raja of Perlis by the Siamese after helping them suppress a rebellion by the Raja of Ligor, a microstate in the Pattani region. The Jamalullails are of Arab descent and continue to rule the state of Perlis.\n\nThe seat of the Raja of Perlis is Arau.\n\nThe Perak sultanate is founded by the son of the last sultan of Malacca, Sultan Muzaffar Shah. His descendants still live until this day. The Sultan of Perak resides in Istana Iskandariah in Kuala Kangsar.\n\nThe first Sultan of Selangor was HRH Sultan Sallehuddin Shah of Selangor. He took the title as the Sultan on November 1742. He was the son of the famous Bugis warrior Prince Daeng Chelak. \n\nThe state of Selangor is on the west coast of Peninsular of Malaysia and is bordered by Perak to the north, Pahang to the east, Negeri Sembilan to the south and the Strait of Malacca to the west. It surrounds the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, both of which were once under Selangor's territorial sovereignty.\n\nThe Sultan of Selangor resides in Klang.\n\nThe state of Terengganu is situated in north-eastern Peninsular Malaysia, and is bordered in the northwest by Kelantan, the southwest by Pahang, and the east by the South China Sea. Several outlying islands, including Pulau Perhentian, Pulau Kapas and Pulau Redang, are also a part of the state.\n\nIn seven of the Malay states, succession order is generally determined roughly by agnatic primogeniture. No female may become ruler, and female line descendants are generally excluded from succession.\n\nIn Negeri Sembilan, the Yamtuan Besar of the state is nominally elected by a council of Four Ruling Chieftains (\"Undang Empat\"), although succession stays within the state royal family. In 1967, after the death of Tuanku Munawir, his son, Tunku Muhriz was not selected as the next Yamtuan Besar because of his youth. Instead, the Chieftains elected his uncle, Tuanku Jaafar, to succeed his father. In 2008, upon the death of Tuanku Jaafar, the Chieftains passed over Jaafar's sons and elected Tunku Muhriz as the next ruler.\n\nIn Perak, the throne is rotated among three branches of the royal family. The system originated in the 19th century during the reign of the 18th Sultan of Perak, when it was decided that the throne would rotate among his three sons and their descendants. There are six positions in the order of succession, appointed by the reigning Sultan advised by his Royal Council. Traditionally, the eldest son of the reigning Sultan is placed at the end of the line. When a vacancy occurs in the line of succession, the persons behind in line is typically moved up, and the branch that formerly held the vacant seat is skipped. However, the order of succession is subjected to alteration by the Sultan and his Royal Council. For example, in 1987, Sultan Azlan Shah appointed his eldest son, Raja Nazrin Shah as the Raja Muda (first in line to the throne), bypassing the candidates from the other two branches. The appointment was due to the demise of the previous Raja Muda, Raja Ahmed Sifuddin, and the renouncement of the Raja Di-hilir (second in line to the throne), Raja Ahmad Hisham, for health reasons.\n\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected by and among the nine rulers (excluding minors) every five years or when a vacancy arises (by death, resignation, or deposition by majority vote of the rulers). The Yang di-Pertuan Agong serves a maximum of five years, and may not be re-elected until after all the other states had taken their turns. When the office was established in 1957, the order of seniority of the rulers was based on the length of their reigns on the state thrones. When the first cycle of rotation was completed in 1994, the order of the states in the first cycle became the basis of the order for the second cycle.\n\nThe title of the consort of a monarch is not generally fixed and not automatically obtained by courtesy. A consort may only use a title if it is granted to her either by order of the ruler or during a coronation ceremony. The consorts of different states have different titles, some do not even receive one. The title of a consort in a state may also change depending on the ruler. For instance, the wife of Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin of Terengganu was known as the Tengku Ampuan Besar, while the wife of his grandson Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin is known as the Sultanah (formerly Permaisuri).\n\nTitles of consorts usually take the form Cik Puan, Raja Perempuan, Sultanah, Tengku Ampuan, Raja Permaisuri, Tengku Permaisuri, or Permaisuri.\n\nThe royal capitals are the cities and towns where the official residences of the rulers are situated. In some states, the royal capital is different from the administrative capital.\n\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong resides in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n"}

Short-wave international broadcasting in Mongolia dates back over 40 years. The first broadcast in October, 1964 was a half hour transmission in Mongolian and Chinese, beamed to China. In the next few years, Mongolian international broadcasting expanded in terms of languages used, broadcast hours and target areas. The English service of Radio Ulaanbaatar, which was renamed The Voice Of Mongolia on January 1, 1997, was launched on January 29, 1965. Today the output of The Voice Of Mongolia consists of various programmes designed to provide information about Mongolia and the Mongolians, their history, traditions and culture. It broadcasts a total of 8 hours a day in 5 languages: Mongolian, English, Chinese, Russian and Japanese.\n\nAll of the Voice Of Mongolia's broadcasts come directly from its Khonkhor Transmitting Station, about 25 km east of Ulan Bator, Mongolia's capital. It broadcasts through Soviet-made 100, 250, and 500 kW transmitters and curtain antennas built in the mid sixties. The transmissions beamed to East Asia provide fair reception in South America, and the South Asian transmissions can be heard in Southern Africa and in Europe as well. However, this reception is influenced by propagation conditions and frequency congestion.\n\n\n"}
