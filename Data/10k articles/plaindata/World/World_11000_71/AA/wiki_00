Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane a very significant achievement. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini and began testing models based on his designs, which led them to the development of hydrofoil watercraft. Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell, with his chief engineer Casey Baldwin, began hydrofoil experiments in the summer of 1908. During Bell's world tour of 1910–1911, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy, where they rode in his hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying.\n\nOn returning to Bell's large laboratory and boatyard at his Beinn Bhreagh estate near Baddeck, Nova Scotia, they experimented with a number of designs, culminating in \"HD-4\". In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in Westmount to work on the pontoons of \"HD-4\". Pinaud soon took over the Bell Boatyard at Beinn Bhreagh. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to \"HD-4\".

Bell's report to the U.S. Navy permitted him to obtain two Liberty V-12 engines in July 1919.\n\nBell and associate Frederick W. \"Casey\" Baldwin began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908, as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water.

Tax havens are characterised by having only nominal or no taxes, impeding the free exchange of information on taxpayers with other governments through administrative practices or laws, non-transparency, and a lack of substantial activities. Harmful preferential regimes, whether in member or non-member countries, are identified by four main traits. Like tax havens, their legal or administrative systems hamper the exchange of information and create an absence of transparency, and have effectively low or no taxes. Finally, the regime may partially isolate itself from the taxpayers and bear little to none of the tax burden, a practice known as “ring-fencing.” \n\n"}

There are also at least 1 in 200 – or 500,000 – kids and teens that have OCD. That means four or five kids with OCD are likely to be enrolled in any average size elementary school. In a medium to large high school, there could be 20 students struggling with the challenges caused by OCD.\n\nIn 1986, the International OCD Foundation – originally the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation – was created by a small, dedicated group of individuals who had OCD. They were all participating in research studies at the Connecticut Mental Health Center in New Haven, CT. The principal investigator on the studies was Wayne Goodman, M.D., a junior faculty psychiatrist who started the OCD program at Yale University School of Medicine during his residency training there. It was also Dr. Goodman's idea to bring the group together.\nOriginally the plan had been to just form a self-help group, but as soon as they got together they realized that there was a great deal of work to be done to defeat OCD. So in November 1986, they started the Foundation as a way to get the word out about OCD and its treatment. This was the first time for many of them to find some relief from OCD and to meet others who were also suffering from OCD. Being together inspired them to start working together to help others suffering from OCD.\n\nBefore the first meeting, some of the members sent a letter to ABC's 20/20 describing OCD and suggesting that the producers do a segment on it. As soon as the group got together in 1986, they drafted a brochure explaining OCD with the help of Dr. Goodman and put together notices giving the locations of the 22 locations around the country where the trials were taking place.\n\nIn March 1987, John Stoessel of ABC's 20/20 featured a segment with Dr. Goodman and one of his patients, another Foundation founder. The reaction was immediate and overwhelming. The network television show opened the door for thousands of people to step forward and put a name on their illness. The small corps of founders were flooded with 20,000 inquiries in the days following the 20/20 segment. While they recognized their own need for support and more information, they were not prepared for the tremendous need throughout the country. A PO box, a small grant for long distance phone calls, and weekly meetings were used to answer all inquiries and to match patients with the 22 clinical trial sites throughout the country.\n\nWithin the year, the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation – now the International OCD Foundation – was formalized as a not-for-profit corporation and the group began mailing out the locations of the 22 sites where treatment was being provided, its new brochure and a newsletter to spread the word on OCD and its possible treatments. A Scientific Advisory Board, composed of researchers and treatment providers from the 22 clinical trial sites, was organized and led by Dr. Goodman.\n\nBy 1988, the Foundation was ready to bring information to the psychotherapy community. Board members set up an information booth and attended the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. The founders attended other meetings and conventions, and they realized the need to provide information not only to people seeking treatment, but also to the mental health community so that treatment was appropriate and accessible.\n\nIn 1989, the Foundation hired its first paid staff. Funding came first from pharmaceutical companies, but membership grew rapidly providing operating funds and a national network. The Foundation provided guidance on creating OCD support groups and 52 were established across the country.\n\nThe clarity of the vision of the founding members facilitated the depth and breadth of the Foundation's growth. Within a decade, the Foundation established the Behavior Therapy Training Institutes (BTTI) which train therapists across the country, research awards for studies on OCD, an Annual Conference, publications and videos, comprehensive educational materials about OCD in children for teachers, a website and a bi-monthly newsletter.\n\nIn 2007, the Board of Directors voted to move the Foundation from New Haven, CT to Boston, MA. With a 100% turn over in staff, this marked a significant transition for the 20-plus year old organization. Today, the Foundation has 12 individuals serving on the Board of Directors, 9 full-time paid staff, 47 Scientific Advisory Board members, 22 affiliates, 6,000 members/financial supporters, 32 Institutional Members and an operating budget of 1 million dollars. Funding for the Foundation's programs come from donations, membership fees, and grants. The International OCD Foundation no longer accepts money from pharmaceutical or biomedical companies.\n\nThe mission of the organization at its founding is much the same as today: education, awareness, training, accessing resources and research. In 2009, the IOCDF hired Teak Media to help promote awareness about OCD and effective treatments. The collaboration between Teak and the IOCDF resulted in almost 100 media hits in newspapers, online, in magazines, and has been featured on Nightline and CNN. Teak regularly accesses the IOCDF's Speakers Bureau. The Speakers Bureau members include people with OCD who understand firsthand the challenges of this disorder in addition to well-known clinical and research experts who have treated people with OCD.\n\nLate in 2009, a newly designed website was launched with links to social networking sites including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The website also continues to be a source of information about OCD and related disorders, effective treatment, a database of 250 support groups, 1,000 treatment providers, and 30-plus OCD intensive treatment programs. Additionally, in Spring of 2010, the IOCDF launched a virtual Hoarding Center.\nIn 2010, the Foundation hosted its 17th Annual Conference. Over 1,000 individuals attended this year including those with OCD, their family members, treatment professionals and researchers. The organization continues to distribute quarterly newsletters, provide three Behavior Therapy Training Institutes around the country annually, and continues to fund OCD related research.\n\nAdditional initiatives the IOCDF has prioritized this year include revamping and updating the “OCD in the Classroom” program, launching a Pediatric OCD website, promoting awareness through OCD Awareness Week events, and building and developing international resources for individuals suffering with OCD around the world.\n\n"}

{"id": "494979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=494979", "title": "Republic of Ezo", "text": "Republic of Ezo\n\nThe was a short-lived state established in 1869 by a part of the former Tokugawa military in what is now known as Hokkaido, the large but sparsely populated northernmost island in modern Japan. Ezo is notable for being the first government to attempt to institute democracy in Japan.\n\nAfter the defeat of the forces of the Tokugawa shogunate in the Boshin War (1869) of the Meiji Restoration, a part of the former \"shōgun\"s navy led by Admiral Enomoto Takeaki fled to the northern island of Ezo (now known as Hokkaido), together with several thousand soldiers and a handful of French military advisers and their leader, Jules Brunet. Enomoto made a last effort to petition the Imperial Court to be allowed to develop Hokkaido and maintain the traditions of the samurai unmolested, but his request was denied.\n\nOn January 27, 1869 (New Style), the independent \"Republic of Ezo\" was proclaimed, with a government organisation based on that of the United States, with Enomoto elected as its first president (\"sosai\"). Elections were based on universal suffrage among the samurai class. This was the first election ever held in Japan, where a feudal structure under an Emperor with military warlords was the norm. Through Hakodate Magistrate Nagai Naoyuki, attempts were made to reach out to foreign legations present in Hakodate to obtain international diplomatic recognition.\n\nThe treasury included 180,000 gold \"ryō\" coins Enomoto retrieved from Osaka Castle following \"Shōgun\" Tokugawa Yoshinobu's precipitous departure after the Battle of Toba–Fushimi in early 1868.\n\nDuring the winter of 1868–1869, the defences around the southern peninsula of Hakodate were enhanced, with the star fortress of Goryōkaku at the centre. The troops were organised under a joint Franco-Japanese command, commander-in-chief Ōtori Keisuke being seconded by the French captain Jules Brunet, and divided into four brigades, each commanded by a French officer (Fortant, Marlin, Cazeneuve and Bouffier). The brigades were themselves divided into two half-brigades each, under Japanese command.\n\nBrunet demanded (and received) a signed personal pledge of loyalty from all officers and insisted they assimilate French ideas. An anonymous French officer wrote that Brunet had taken charge of everything:\n\nImperial troops soon consolidated their hold on mainland Japan, and in April 1869 dispatched a fleet and an infantry force of 7,000 men to Hokkaido. The Imperial forces progressed swiftly, won the Battle of Hakodate, and surrounded the fortress at Goryōkaku. Enomoto surrendered on June 26, 1869, turning the Goryōkaku over to Satsuma staff officer Kuroda Kiyotaka on June 27, 1869. Kuroda is said to have been deeply impressed by Enomoto's dedication in combat, and is remembered as the one who spared the latter's life from execution. On September 20 of the same year, the island was given its present name, Hokkaido (\"Hokkaidō\", literally \"Northern Sea Region\").\n\nWhile later history texts were to refer to May 1869 as being when Enomoto accepted Emperor Meiji's rule, the Imperial rule was never in question for the Ezo Republic, as made evident by part of Enomoto's message to the at the time of his arrival in Hakodate:\n\nThus from Enomoto's perspective, the efforts to establish a government in Hokkaido were not only for the sake of providing for the Tokugawa clan on the one hand (burdened as it was with an enormous amount of redundant retainers and employees), but also as developing Ezo for the sake of defence for the rest of Japan, something which had been a topic of concern for some time. Recent scholarship has noted that for centuries, Ezo was not considered a part of Japan the same way that the other \"main\" islands of modern Japan were, so the creation of the Ezo Republic, in a contemporary mindset, was not an act of secession, but rather of \"bringing\" the politico-social entity of \"Japan\" formally to Ezo.\n\nEnomoto was sentenced to a brief prison sentence, but was freed in 1872 and accepted a post as a government official in the newly renamed Hokkaido Land Agency. He later became ambassador to Russia, and held several ministerial positions in the Meiji Government.\n\n"}

Hwanung heard their prayers and gave them 20 cloves of garlic, a bundle of mugwort and ordered them to stay out of the sunlight and eat only this food for 100 days. Due to hunger, the tiger left the cave after roughly 20 days, but the bear remained inside. After 21 days, she was transformed into a woman.\n\nUngnyeo was grateful and made offerings to Hwanung. Her lack of a husband drove her to depression, and she began to pray beneath a sacred betula tree (신단수 / 神檀樹) to be blessed with a child. Hwanung heard her prayers and was deeply moved. He took Ungnyeo as his wife and soon after, she gave birth to a son, Dangun, who would go on to found the nation of Korea.\n\nThere are two main characteristics of Ungnyeo. The founding myth of the Korean ancient nation generally sets the founder's paternal blood line as the Chensin(天神, The God of sky) and the mother line as the JIsin(地神, The God of ground). As a result, Ungnyeo is regarded as a type of totem deified by Dangun()'s mother lineage.\n\nOn the other hand, The bear itself has religious implications. The bear is the god of the land and symbolizes the uterus that produces products in farming culture. Thus, bears are interpreted female predominantly.
