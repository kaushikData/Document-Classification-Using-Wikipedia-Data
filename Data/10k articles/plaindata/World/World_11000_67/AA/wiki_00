The organization derives its name from the name of the continent of Africa and from the former Malagasy Republic, now Madagascar. The organization went defunct in 1985.\n\nThe organization was founded on 12 September 1961 in Antananarivo by members of the Brazzaville Group of French-Speaking States developing out of a meeting held in Brazzaville in December 1960. Twelve francophone countries agreed to maintain close relationships but also a special relationship with the former colonial power, France. The original aims were both economic and political: to adopt common stands on international issues, to promote economic and culture cooperation, and to maintain a common defense organization. However, this caused a problem: the organization would have to depend on France. The diversity, geography, and post-colonial problems of the different countries stopped the organization from ever becoming significant.\n\nIn March 1964 the UAM changed its name to the Afro-Malagasy Union for Economic Cooperation (Union Africaine et Malgache de Coopération Économique; UAMCE). Moktar Ould Daddah was elected as the president of the organisation while the city of Yaoundé was selected as the headquarters seat. Subsequently, it confined itself to economic affairs and by 1966 had become inactive.\n\nThe African and Malagasy Common Organization (Organization Commune Africaine et Malgache; OCAM) was the successor to the UAMCE. It was set up at Nouakchott in February 1965 and comprised the original 12 members of the UAM with the addition of Togo. In May 1965 its membership was increased by the admission of the former Belgian colonies of Congo (Kinshasa) and Rwanda. In June 1965, however, Mauritania withdrew. The remaining 14 then signed the new OCAM charter on 27 June at a meeting in Antananarivo, Madagascar. The aims of the organization were economic, social, technical, and cultural cooperation. OCAM dropped the political and defense objectives that its predecessor, the UAM, had attempted to embrace. It created the structures of an international organization: a Conference of Heads of State and Government, a Council of Ministers, a Secretariat and Secretary-General, and established its headquarters at Bangui in the Central African Republic. It developed a number of joint services and of these the most successful and most well known is the multinational airline Air Afrique. In 1979 the airline was separated from OCAM.\n\nThe organization's later history became increasingly troubled. Mauritius joined in 1970. Congo (Kinshasa), by then renamed Zaire, withdrew in 1972; Congo (Brazzaville) in 1973; Cameroon, Chad and Madagascar in 1974; Gabon in 1977. However, some of these countries retained their links with OCAM's various agencies. In 1982 OCAM held a summit at Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire; it had then changed its name, though only to substitute Mauritius for Madagascar, to Organization Commune Africaine et Mauricienne. OCAM, also, has ceased to operate. The organization officially became extinct in 1985.\n\nFounding members:\n\nJoined February 1965:\n\nJoined May 1965:\n\nJoined 1970:\n"}

As Dave Dennis, from 1964 to 1966 he was the \"Double D\", the fastest-talking and highest-rated DJ on Radio London, operating from the pirate ship MV Galaxy and broadcasting alongside future household names such as Kenny Everett and Tony Blackburn. As Neil Spence, from 1968 to 1985 he oversaw the early radio careers of James Whale, Roger Scott, Adrian Love, Graham Dene, Jeremy Vine and Dale Winton, among many others who would reach the top of the UK broadcasting industry.\n\nSpence was educated at Leighton Park School in Reading, Berkshire, a highly academic school where he was boasted he was not just bottom of his class but of the whole school. He left school to work in farming and stayed for eight years, by which time he was the manager of the farm and claimed on-air to be an authority on pigs. He attended the prestigious Central School of Speech and Drama in London for a three-year acting course, and then spent time in English repertory theatre.\n\nSpence began his radio presenting career with the pirate station Radio Atlanta, which began broadcasting in May 1964 from the motor vessel MV Mi Amigo off the east coast of the UK. When Radio Atlanta was taken over by Radio Caroline in July 1964, Spence resigned and left the station. At some point that year he worked briefly as a DJ at Radio City, which broadcast from an old army fort at Shivering Sands in the Thames Estuary. A short time later he was as at Radio Invicta, a \"sweet music station\" which broadcast from a second world war fort at Red Sands, near Whitstable in Kent.\n\nLate in 1964 a demo tape won Spence a lunchtime spot on Radio London, which was due to begin broadcasting in December that year from the motor vessel MV Galaxy. Along with the other launch presenters he adopted a new on-air name, Dave Dennis. Among his early colleagues were Earl Richmond, Kenny Everett, Dave Cash, and senior DJ Tony Windsor, who had been with Spence at Radio Atlanta. Later arrivals included Tony Blackburn.\n\nThe station was ground-breaking for UK pirate radio, in that unlike its major rival Radio Caroline it used a tight American top-40 format. \"Caroline had always been what I call catch-as-catch-can radio,\" said Dave Cash: \"You used to go out there with a bunch of records and play them. No one had any idea what order they were in. No one had any idea of format at all.\"\n\nAfter a shaky start, Spence became comfortable with the Radio London format and quickly established his lunchtime show as the most popular on the station, working live for three hours a day, often in rough seas where gramophone needles skipped across vinyl records, and with blankets to deaden the echo from the steel walls of the studio. His ratings could not be put down to formatting or music choice alone, as every DJ followed a similar tight format, based on the Dallas station KLIF. It was almost unheard of for a lunchtime radio show on any station to be a bigger draw than the breakfast show. An eventful two years saw Spence in his fast-talking persona of Dave Dennis keep his lunchtime show at the top of the station's ratings despite later competition from a wildly comedic teatime show presented by Kenny Everett and Dave Cash.\n\nIn April 1966 Spence took his holiday in New York, where he was influenced by the high-pressure presentation style of DJs such as Bruce Morrow and Jack Spector, and the formatting skills of WABC's Rick Sklar and WMCA's Ruth Meyer with her team-radio approach to presentation known as the 'Good Guys.'\n\nSpence quit Radio London in December 1966. His parting shot was a hit single which reached number 19 in the station's own chart, featuring his sickly-sweet reading to music of a Victorian newspaper editorial, 'Yes, Virginia', reassuring a young girl that Santa Claus did indeed exist. He went to live in Southern Ireland with Jo Spence, then a photographer's assistant and later a pioneering feminist photographer of the 1970s and eighties, who changed her name to his by deed poll.\n\nRadio London closed down in 1967 with the introduction of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act in 1967, and BBC Radio 1 began broadcasting the same year. On his return to England, Spence began making jingles and trails for Radio 1, where many of his pirate radio contemporaries were forging on-air DJ careers. Kenny Everett in his first BBC broadcast in May 1967 jokingly named the Double-D as one of his \"best friendships.\" Spence later said he had worked for all four BBC Radio networks, including the classical station BBC Radio 3 and the speech based BBC Radio 4.\n\nIn 1970 he was appointed the first programme controller of the United Biscuits Network, UBN, a station which began broadcasting by landline to two of the UK factories of United Biscuits in September that year. The aim of the station was to keep workers entertained and productive, reducing staff turnover and absenteeism while providing safety and hygiene information. A year later UB chairman Hector Laing announced the station was achieving its objectives despite many doubters, and would expand to other factories. Spence told the Financial Times with some justification that the station's quality equaled BBC Radio 1 and was \"a great sound.\" Spence developed a station which provided a top-40 format during the day, a middle-of-the-road MOR format in the evening, and a soul, blues and reggae format at night.\n\nSpence also gained a reputation for talent spotting, and for developing the careers of DJs, who frequently moved on to regular broadcast stations. Among those whose early careers he helped to forge were Graham Dene, who he discovered in the BBC Gramophone Library, Adrian Love, and Roger Scott. As Independent Local Radio (ILR) began to expand, many UBN presenters left to work at the new stations. In 1977 Spence himself moved to ILR, taking over as programme controller at Radio Trent from former UBN presenter Bob Snyder. At Trent, Spence developed formats to appeal to a broad local audience, and continued to find and develop new talent. Among his hires there was Dale Winton, another DJ who had been at UBN.\n\nSpence's first training job was in the late 1960s at the \"London Broadcasting School\" run by his ex-colleague Earl Richmond. Among his first trainees was James Whale. Spence developed a strong commitment to training and development during his years at UBN and Radio Trent, and that, together with his ability to talent spot, led Michael Bukht, then programme controller at Capital Radio, to ask him in 1980 to join the newly established National Broadcasting School as head of programmking.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1985, Spence led intensive three-month courses to train music radio presenters. The school's aim was to develop talent for ILR, but many also went on to work for the BBC and in television as well as overseas, including in pirate radio. Alumni from his presentation courses included BBC presenter Jeremy Vine John Leech and the musician Mikey Dread. When the school closed in 1985, it appears Spence refused offers of work and was believed to have returned to farming. He resisted all invitations from former colleagues to attend reunions, particularly those from his pirate radio days. He died in Lincolnshire in 2007.\n\nWhen the founders of Radio Atlanta had discussed where to find suitable voices for a commercial station broadcasting to the UK, they concluded that no British broadcasters were capable of the task as they were so firmly rooted in the BBC style. However, they took Spence on, together with a number of DJs well-versed in commercial broadcasting in Australia. Surviving recordings give a flavour of Spence's conventional and actorly British delivery. Although formal by comparison to US and Australian commercial stations, his style was far more relaxed than the BBC of the time.\n\nMoving to Radio Invicta, Spence maintained his actor-DJ style. However, by the time he arrived at Radio London in late 1966 his performance was still considered \"stuffy\" by senior DJ Tony Windsor and programme director Ben Toney. Windsor was tasked with turning Neil Spence the announcer and presenter into Dave Dennis the DJ, and was asked by Toney to \"break in\" Spence and \"give him a few tips on how to present a proper deejay show.\" Spence, who had grown up with little else to listen to except the BBC, responded poorly to Windsor's direction. \"In the end I could tell he was about to drive Dave around the bend,\" said Toney, who then asked Spence to use his acting training and in effect to create \"Dave Dennis, the Double-D\" as a character to be played on air.\n\nToney was using off-air tapes of the Dallas top-40 station KLIF as a formatting aid for Radio London, and instructed Spence to listen to them carefully. \"I then told him that if he were any kind of actor, he would be able to create the style of programming recorded on the tapes. As it turned out, Dave went from being a stuffy announcer to a top-notch deejay in a matter of weeks,\" said Toney. Toney later said that of all the DJs he encouraged towards the new style of British commercial broadcasting, Spence \"made the greatest amount of progress of them all.\" As new voices came on board, Spence the actor-DJ resolutely maintained the Dave Dennis character, catchphrases and all, in the face of a rising tide of ever more elaborate jokes aimed against him.\n\nHis cabin mate Kenny Everett began the trend by making on-air references to his smelly feet and terrible temper. As the comedy became more sophisticated, Spence found himself on air with Everett having been invited to recite the weirdly obscure lyrics of the song 'Along Comes Mary' by The Association in his best actorly voice. After the words of the final chorus, \"When we met I was sure out to lunch, Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch,\" Everett announced: \"That was 'Along Comes Mary,' ladies and gentlemen, as Dave Dennis crawls out of the studio on his knees.\" Everett told his audience that Spence deserved an OBE for his performance.\n\nRecordings of Spence's lunchtime programme as Dave Dennis show his own humour breaking through his former style, as he combines a rich British-accented voice with an irreverent approach which slyly and then more confidently sends up the BBC announcers of the day, with the speed of his delivery matching the rhythm of the music he plays and his theme tune 'Go Mean' by Ruffle.\n\nIn April 1966 Spence spent his holiday from Radio London in New York, where his reputation gave him access top radio DJs and programmers. On his return, his presentation style was even faster than before, as if to eliminate any possibility of dead air, and his microphone technique was adapted to cut through mush by making maximum use of the station's transmitter power. \"DD's on-air style became machinegun-like with the volume at+3dB,\" said fellow London Radio DJ Duncan Johnson. \"I made a comment and he said the top man in New York says you have to push the compressor to hold the listener. I didn't bother to ask why.\"\n\nSpence's later on-air style remained contemporary and continued to hold the large audience he had built. \"Dave Dennis swings,\" said one of his jingles made by Kenny Everett. But photographs began to show his newer colleagues taking on the fashions of the Swinging Sixties, while Dave Dennis remained in the swing of an earlier era. After his departure from the station, Spence's Christmas single recorded under his own name made full use of his actor-DJ talents and his acerbic humour - any eight-year-old listening would genuinely believe there was a Santa Claus, while anyone older would hoot with laughter at the cloying sentimentality.\n\nThe veteran radio presenter John Peters has described his own broadcasting style as bright, tight, brief and real. Peters was trained and mentored by Spence at UBN, and these were precisely the qualities Spence emphasised to trainees from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s. Spence's own presentation style when he left Radio London at the end of 1966 was far removed from the style he encouraged in later years as a radio executive and trainer. But despite his abandonment of what he later called the \"disc jokey\" style, his approach was entirely consistent in having respect for the audience. If the audience had moved on, then so should the presenters.\n\nAs a trainer and mentor, Spence became a ferocious critic of the on-air performances of radio DJs. Dale Winton described him as \"a very hard taskmaster who took no prisoners and could be terrifyingly blunt and honest if he didn't like your performance.\" On listening to Winton's second show at Radio Trent, Spence \"true to form, pulled my performance to pieces with all the skill of a friendly surgeon without the use of anaesthetic.\" Spence liked Winton enough to give him a regular afternoon show. If he didn't like a DJ, the words he used might be much the same, but the surgeon's delivery would be icily dismissive.\n\nHowever, most DJs with the talent on which to build a career came to respect and admire Spence, who despite an abrasive personality at times, could warm towards those in whom he saw significant potential. Certainly he was keen to ensure that every presenter he trained and mentored produced their best possible performances on air. Given the qualities and immediacy of the medium, it was crucial for DJs to have the ability to recover from a mistake or a setback and continue to broadcast effectively and entertainingly, and Spence's withering critiques could be seen as essential to build on-air resilience.\n\nAt UBN in the early 1970s he ran in effect a different radio station for each factory shift. A morning top-40 format gave way to an evening middle-of-the-road feel, and then a soul, blues and reggae station at night. \"The whole station is run on tight commercial lines,\" he told trade magazine Billboard, but added: \"Unlike US Top 40 we allow much scope for a DJ's personality - and for factories in England this is just what is needed and indeed, required. This does not necessarily mean more rap [i.e. chat] - just better rap.\"\n\nAt the National Broadcasting School, Spence distilled the lessons of his pirate days as well as his experience of UBN and Radio Trent. He brought on presenters suitable for ILR stations, which although they carried advertising, had a strong public service requirement as well as a commercial need to appeal to as many people in their local area as possible. At Radio London, Spence had been scrupulous in meeting and talking to his listeners, and listening to them in return, and he now instilled this approach into a new generation.\n\nHe was disparaging about presenters from his pirate days who went into ILR without changing their style to reflect a different audience and different times, telling one trainee in the early 1980s that if she listened to his old Radio London colleague Dave Cash, at that time a presenter at ILR's Radio West, she would never find an audience. Any trainee who mentioned Spence's own pirate radio past was given a cold stare and a cold shoulder. He told a former Radio London colleague who invited him to a reunion that he refused to get involved in \"this dated, rebarbative and otiose subject.\" The actor-DJ who had thrived on a comedic onslaught by Dave Cash and Kenny Everett was careful to tell trainees that the only result if they did this to their own colleagues would be to make the butt of their jokes more popular, and their own ratings slide.\n\nSpence took a high standard of technical competence as a basic requirement to present a tightly formatted show, and a bright personality was an absolute essential. But above all he insisted that presenters should be their authentic selves, despite his own success as a DJ having come from adopting an on-air persona. However, the personable Dave Dennis was still a recognisable part of Spence's often spikey off-air personality. His ferocious assessments of trainees' performance seemed designed to strip away any artifice or pretension, and force presenters to be genuine and real. Authenticity also meant they should use their own accent. Presenters who acquired a mid-Atlantic twang should be taken to the mid-Atlantic and left there. And he insisted DJs should be brief and to the point: \"Just remember they want to hear the record. It's the people who made the record who have the real talent, not you.\"\n\nSpence's critiques were always delivered while wearing his trademark dark suit and polished shoes, with every inch of his angular six foot two frame reinforcing that he was in charge. Spence played the part of programme controller with aplomb. He used the quintessential English upper-middle class accent that many successful actors adopted. His vocabulary was extensive to the point of baroque. His volume would rise and the speed increase as a trainee tried to get a word in edgeways, but in keeping with his ingrained professionalism, there was never a swearword, just in case somewhere a microphone was open.\n\nDuring Spence's 1966 trip to New York, the editors of the trade magazine Billboard were interested not only in his ability to build and hold a large radio audience, but in his views on the regulatory environment and the likelihood of commercial radio being introduced in the UK. Spence was demonstrable proof to the US industry that British audiences wanted more than the BBC was prepared to offer, and that US top-40 format commercial radio could be adapted to attract large advertising spends while still being authentically British.\n\nHe was not the only DJ broadcasting to the UK to develop the American top-40 format for a British audience, but he was the first to master it, and he took it further and faster than his contemporaries, making early pirate radio colleagues like Earl Richmond and Tony Windsor look stuffy in their turn. In doing so, he helped prove to the British government that British audiences had a thirst for something other than the staid BBC approach. In the event, in 1967 the British government introduced the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act, and the BBC established its national pop music station Radio 1. Once commercial radio had been ruled out by the British government, interest in Spence in the US was nil.\n\nSpence's legacy as what Dale Winton called \"one of the best ever DJs on pirate radio\" could easily have been a host of imitators in the same Dave Dennis Double-D mould. David Lloyd, a former member of the Radio Authority, acknowledges Spence's impact saying: \"His was a powerful voice and influence on the station from launch.\" But perhaps Spence's greatest achievement was to know when the pirate days had become tired and old, well before parodies like Smashie and Nicey started to bite those pirate DJs who became part of the BBC Radio establishment.\n\nAt UBN he turned what would have otherwise been a minor industrial radio station into an unlikely but significant source of major talent for ILR. Together with his work at Radio Trent and the National Broadcasting School, he produced not one but several generations of presenters who knew how to respect an audience in the best possible way - by keeping as many of them as possible entertained. His contribution to making independent radio a viable alternative to the monolithic BBC radio of the day was significant. As Dale Winton put it, he was already \"an influential guy\" before he even began to play a pivotal role at the National Broadcasting School.\n\nSpence's former Radio London colleague Dave Cash, acknowledging that Spence as Dave Dennis had been a superb DJ, added: \"His true vocation was teaching.\" In a profession tending naturally towards self-obsession, while Radio 1's ex-pirate DJs matured into their comfortable berths, Spence was developing not his own presentation style but that of others - together with a finely tuned ear for how a station should sound, what made it distinctive from its competitors, and most importantly how it could stay in touch with its audience.\n\n"}

{"id": "235890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235890", "title": "Outsourcing", "text": "Outsourcing\n\nOutsourcing is \"an agreement in which one company hires another company to be responsible for an existing internal activity.\" It often involves the contracting of a business process (e.g., payroll processing, claims processing), operational, and/or non-core functions, such as manufacturing, facility management, call center support). The term \"outsourcing\" came from \"outside resourcing\" and dates back to at least 1981. Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one firm to another. Outsourcing is also the practice of handing over control of public services to private enterprise.\n\nOutsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting, and sometimes includes offshoring (relocating a business function to a distant country) or nearshoring (transferring a business process to a nearby country). Outsourcing is often confused with offshoring, however, they can be distinguished: a company can outsource (work with a service provider) and not offshore to a distant country. For example, in 2003 Procter & Gamble outsourced their facilities' management support, but it did not involve offshoring.\n\nFinancial savings from lower international labor rates can provide a major motivation for outsourcing or offshoring. There can be tremendous savings from lower international labor rates when offshoring.\n\nIn contrast, insourcing entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished via vertical integration. However, a business can provide a contract service to another organization without necessarily insourcing that business process.\n\nTwo organizations may enter into a contractual agreement involving an exchange of services, expertise, and payments. Outsourcing is said to help firms to perform well in their core competencies, fuel innovation, and mitigate a shortage of skill or expertise in the areas where they want to outsource.\n\nIn the early 21st century, businesses increasingly outsourced to suppliers outside their own country, sometimes referred to as offshoring or offshore outsourcing. Several related terms have emerged to refer to various aspects of the complex relationship between economic organizations or networks, such as nearshoring, crowdsourcing, multisourcing, strategic alliances/strategic partnerships, strategic outsourcing., and vested outsourcing.\n\nOutsourcing can offer greater budget flexibility and control. Outsourcing allows organizations to pay for the services and business functions they need, when they need them. It also reduces the need to hire and train specialized staff, brings in fresh engineering expertise, and can reduce capital, operating expenses, and risk.\n\n\"Do what you do best and outsource the rest\" has become an internationally recognized business tagline first \"coined and developed\" in the 1990s by the \"legendary management consultant\" Peter Drucker. The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. It has been said that Mr. Drucker began explaining the concept of \"Outsourcing\" as early as 1989 in his \"Wall Street Journal\" article entitled \"Sell the Mailroom.\"\n\nFrom Drucker's perspective, a company should only seek to subcontract in those areas in which it demonstrated no special ability. The business strategy outlined by his slogan recommended that companies should take advantage of a specialist provider's knowledge and economies of scale to improve performance and achieve the service needed.\n\nIn 2009 by way of recognition, Peter Drucker posthumously received a significant honor, when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.\n\nA serial report published in the 2010s looking at outsourcing models in clinical development described seven distinct models: Preferred Provider, Fee-for-Service, Functional Service Provider (FSP), Hybrid Full Service/FSP, In-Sourced, Compound/Program-based, and Sole-Source.\n\nCompanies primarily outsource to reduce certain costs, which may include peripheral or \"non-core\" business expenses, high taxes, high energy costs, excessive government regulation or mandates, and production or labor costs. The incentive to outsource may be greater for U.S. companies due to unusually high corporate taxes and mandated benefits like social security, Medicare, and safety protection (OSHA regulations). At the same time, it appears U.S. companies do not outsource to reduce executive or managerial costs. For instance, executive pay in the United States in 2007 was more than 400 times more than average workers—a gap 20 times bigger than it was in 1965. Other reasons include:\n\nOutsourcing of white-collar work has grown rapidly since the early 21st century, despite a focus on manufacturing outsourcing. The digital workforce of countries like India and China are only paid a fraction of what would be minimum wage in the US. On average, software engineers are getting paid between 250,000 and 1,500,000 rupees (US$4,000 to US$23,000) in India as opposed to $40,000–$100,000 in countries such as the US and Canada. Outsourcing has also expanded to include many different countries; Costa Rica has become a big source for outsourcing work as it offers the advantage of a highly educated labor force, a large bilingual population, stable democratic government, shares similar time zones with the United States, and it takes only a few hours to travel between Costa Rica and the US. Companies such as Intel, Procter & Gamble, HP, Gensler, Amazon and Bank of America have big operations in Costa Rica. In the recent years there has been an exponential growth in white collar work with service providers emerging in a wide range of activities, from banking and legal services to companies like Resources US, a pioneer in outsourcing services for architecture firms in United States. Unlike outsourced manufacturing, outsourced white collar work, offers workers the flexibility to choose their working hours, and which companies to work for. With many individuals telecommuting from home, the companies that require this type of work do not need to allocate additional funds for setting up of office space, management salary, and employee benefits as these individuals are contracted workers.\n\nGlobalization and complex supply chains, along with greater physical distance between higher management and the production-floor employees often requires a change in management methodologies, as inspection and feedback may not be as direct and frequent as in internal processes. This often requires the assimilation of new communication methods such as voice over IP, instant messaging, and Issue tracking systems, new time management methods such as time tracking software, and new cost- and schedule-assessment tools such as cost estimation software.\n\nIn the area of call center outsourcing, organizations that are not experienced in working with outsourced call centers may suffer from lower end-user-experience as a result of outsourcing. This is exacerbated when outsourcing is combined with offshoring in regions where the first language and culture are different.\n\nFor example, foreign call center agents may speak with different linguistic features such as accents, word use and phraseology, which may impede comprehension. The visual cues that are missing in a telephone call may lead to misunderstandings and difficulties.\n\nIn 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver E. Williamson wrote that the governance structure is the \"framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided.\" Adding further that \"because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.\" University of Tennessee researchers have been studying complex outsourcing relationships since 2003. Emerging thinking regarding strategic outsourcing is focusing on creating a contract structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex business arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, ﬂexible, and credible way.\n\nBefore outsourcing, an organization is responsible for the actions of their entire staff, sometimes a substantial liability. When these same people are transferred to an outsource service provider, they may not even change desks. But their legal status changes. They are no longer directly employed by (and responsible to) the organization. This creates legal, security and compliance issues that are often addressed through the contract between the client and the suppliers. This is one of the most complex areas of outsourcing and sometimes involves a specialist third-party adviser.\n\nFraud is a specific security issue as well as criminal activity, whether it is by employees or the supplier staff. However, it can be disputed that fraud is more likely when outsourcing is involved. For example, in April 2005, a high-profile case involved the theft of $350,000 from four Citibank customers when call-center workers acquired the passwords to customer accounts and transferred the money to their own accounts opened under fictitious names. Citibank did not find out about the problem until the American customers noticed discrepancies with their accounts and notified the bank.\n\nOutsourcing has gone through many iterations and reinventions. Some outsourcing contracts have been partially or fully reversed, citing an inability to execute strategy, lost transparency & control, onerous contractual models, a lack of competition, recurring costs, hidden costs, and so on. Companies shifting to insourcing often cite the desire to increase control, compliance and to gain competitive differentiation through vertical integration or the development of shared services, commonly called a center of excellence.\n\nFurther, the label \"outsourcing\" has been found to be used for too many different kinds of exchanges often in confusing ways. For example, global software development, which often involves people working in different countries, cannot simply be called outsourcing. The outsourcing-based market model fails to explain why these development projects are jointly developed, and not simply bought and sold in the marketplace. Recently, a study has identified an additional system of governance, termed algocracy, which appears to govern global software projects alongside bureaucratic and market-based mechanisms. The study distinguishes code-based governance system from bureaucracy and the market, and underscores the prominent features of each organizational form in terms of its ruling mechanism: bureaucracy (legal-rational), the market (price), and algocracy (programming or algorithm). So, global software development projects, though not insourced, are not outsourced either. They are in-between, in a process that is sometimes termed \"remote in-sourcing.\" Projects are developed together where a common software platform allows different teams around the world to work on the same project together.\n\nFrom the standpoint of labor, outsourcing may represent a new threat, contributing to worker insecurity, and is reflective of the general process of globalization and economic polarization.\n\nOn June 26, 2009, Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric, called for the United States to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the workforce, commenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much and can no longer rely on consumer spending to drive demand.\n\nWestern governments may attempt to compensate workers affected by outsourcing through various forms of legislation. In Europe, the Acquired Rights Directive attempts to address the issue. The Directive is implemented differently in different nations. In the United States, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act is meant to provide compensation for workers directly affected by international trade agreements. Whether or not these policies provide the security and fair compensation they promise is debatable.\n\nA main feature of outsourcing influencing policy-making is the unpredictability it generates regarding the future of any particular sector or skill-group. The uncertainty of future conditions influences governance approaches to different aspects of long-term policies.\n\nEconomic growth requires change, therefore a governance disposed to helping social and economic structures adapt to the changing environment will facilitate growth and a stable transition to new economic structures until the economic structures become detrimental to the social, political and cultural structures.\n\nIn developing countries, policies that embrace the global phenomenon of outsourcing are a logical response to the ongoing movement towards \"open markets\" and \"trade liberalization.\" Outsourcing, when interpreted as a trade phenomenon, complements trade liberalization strategies not only by promoting technological spillovers and capital inflows but also by offsetting the increasing levels of unemployment which result from opening up domestic markets. As prices adjust to those in the global market they no longer reflect domestic productivity, driving lower-productivity firms in the previously protected sectors out of business. Economic theorists argue that the resulting unemployment is only temporary as workers readjust and are eventually incorporated into the country's most productive sectors, namely those which enjoy a competitive edge over other players in the international market. Nonetheless, rapid liberalization of markets in developing countries has not maximized the productivity potential of the region. In the Global South, where technological development is drastically lower than in the North, the redeployment of human and capital resources into new export markets has not come at the cost of necessarily low-productivity sectors but rather underdeveloped ones. In other words, many of the previously protected sectors were not competitive yet on a global scale, not because they naturally lacked the comparative advantage, but because industry efficiency had not yet been reached. In such cases where liberalization stunts the growth of potential industries, unemployment is a reflection of many underemployed resources.\n\nOutsourcing fills in the gap of receding protected national industries, improving employment and living standards. Among other economic externalities, outsourcing promotes capital inflows and infrastructure. In Mexico, wage convergence was faster in cities where outsourcing first took hold through maquiladoras, along the Mexico–United States border. Studies suggest that for every 10% increase in US wages, northern cities in Mexico which are most influenced by outsourcing would experience wage rises of 2.5%, about 0.69% higher than in inner cities.\n\nCorruption and reduced tax revenues after the signing of NAFTA have limited the economic resources available to the Mexican government, thus explaining the difference in investment policies between Mexico and China. Conversely, one of the successes of Asian countries in the twentieth century has been their promotion of higher rates of saving and investment. Studies suggest that the increase in capital input fueled the ‘Asian miracle’ rather than improvements in productivity and industrial efficiency. Though the previous conclusion suggests production conditions in the region remained static, the situation in East Asia experienced rapid transformations. Not only were national educational rates raised drastically, but there was also an increase in patenting and research and development expenditures. Rising levels of education, urbanization and even of patenting illustrate the active role of the government in advancing education as well as encouraging research and development.\n\nJobs become outsourced not based on the skill-level group it represents, but rather based on a variety of other factors including transportation cost of ideas, wage and labour productivity edge. Because of the overall uncertainty regarding the future dynamics of outsourcing it is not possible to predict the nature of labour demand in different regions. To better prepare the domestic workforce to future industry demands, therefore, national education programs ought to focus on flexibility and diversity of skills rather than on any specific task-oriented skills. Emphasis should go on preparing students both to succeed in non-habitual tasks and to adapt to changes in labour demands in the market. A specific goal that ought to be adopted is teaching students how to learn rather than teach them particular skills. This strategy would help students adapt to changing skill requirements in the future thus reducing friction from structural unemployment.\n\nThe uncertainty regarding the domestic productivity edge renders caution a key element of governance to ensure a sustainable regional developmenloyed re-enter the work force and smoothly transition into high-demand labour opportunities, potentially through re-training programs, the government should also address the socioeconomic struggle and other welfare concerns of displaced employees.\n\nNegative welfare effects of outsourcing have gathered substantial public attention. The possibility of outsourcing has internationalized labour markets which used to be local, opening up jobs which were traditionally non-traded to international competition. The resulting combination of lower wages and unemployment for certain jobs has driven the perceived ‘losers’ to engage in heated political debate.\n\nLabour unions in the European Union have succeeded in pushing through protectionist policies in favour or lower-skilled groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including the Common Agricultural Policy on farming. Interest groups opposing outsourcing have been more active to voice their disapproval because the negative outcomes of the phenomenon are more concentrated on specific groups of people, namely those losing jobs to external competition, whereas the benefits from it become dissipated among the population at large. Overall lower prices and greater quality and variety of goods in domestic markets are some of the benefits of exploiting a country's comparative advantage through outsourcing.\n\nUnlike the alleged ‘losers’ from outsourcing, those affected positively by it lack the motivation to organize to voice their support. There has been a wave of protectionism concerned with deep changes in the social structure allegedly imposed on the global system through globalization and outsourcing. The activists see a readjustment of class systems and highlight an increased fracture in societies between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ as different groups adjust to increasingly or decreasingly advantageous positions in the system of outsourcing. Opponents of outsourcing have also denounced it as a threat to local cultural integrity.\n\nThe argument on cultural disintegration points to the standardization of practices and norms as multinational corporations become involved with industries in regions culturally different from those in the country of origin. The alleged diffusion of culture has raised concern over the endurance of cultural norms and values, sociopolitical institutions and frameworks, or even cultural preferences and traditions in a context of increasing foreign presence.\n\nIncreased uncertainty regarding future socioeconomic security ought to be met with policies promoting equality and a fair redistribution of economic gains for a government to maintain its voters’ favour. Because of overall unpredictability, governments will likely need to reassure civilians that the burden of employment jobs resulting from outsourcing will be shared among taxpayers.\n\nThe fluctuations in employment levels are determined by the types of jobs which can be profitably outsourced or offshored. Domestic jobs become offshored or outsourced when lower productivity in other regions is compensated by lower wages, making outsourcing profitable even despite the added costs of transportation. The overall cost-effectiveness of the spatial unbundling of the industrial process thus depends on the cost of transporting specific services or ideas given the available technology. Because of these technological advancements such as the telecommunications revolution, air shipping or the Internet have deeply accelerated outsourcing and may continue to boost this process.\n\nThe future results of technological ingenuity and innovation are unknown, as are its potential impacts employment levels on any given task or job across regions. In the Global South, policies attracting multinational corporations can help increase employment levels and promote growth. Governments that pursue these policies facilitate welfare protection given the context of increased unemployment in industries which cannot compete with the international market due to trade liberalization policies.\n\nOutsourcing results from an internationalization of labor markets as more tasks become tradable. According to leading economist Greg Mankiw, the labour market functions under the same forces as the market of goods, with the underlying implication that the greater the number of tasks available to being moved, the better for efficiency under the gains from trade. With technological progress, more tasks can be offshored at different stages of the overall corporate process.\n\nThere are widespread claims that outsourcing has pushed environmental standards down in developing regions as countries compete to attract foreign projects and investment. Similar to lower wages, lower health and environmental regulations contribute to giving a country a comparative advantage over another due to lower production costs. The controversy this raises, however, is that unlike wages, lower health or environmental standards does benefit the new employees joining the workforce.\nImport competition has caused a de facto ‘race-to-the-bottom’ where countries lower environmental regulations to secure a competitive edge for their industries relative to other countries. As Mexico competes with China over Canadian and American markets, its national Commission for Environmental Cooperation has not been active in enacting or enforcing regulations to prevent environmental damage from increasingly industrialized Export Processing Zones. Similarly, since the signing of NAFTA heavy industries have increasingly moved to the US which has a comparative advantage due to its abundant presence of capital and well-developed technology. A further example of environmental de-regulation with the objective of protecting trade incentives have been the numerous exemptions to carbon taxes in European countries during the 1990s. The evidence suggests that even if outsourcing has promoted lower environmental protection, there are no intrinsic geographic implications that the Global South has been more negatively affected than the North. o Although outsourcing can influence environmental de-regulatory trends, the added cost of preventing pollution does not majorly determine trade flows or industrialization.\n\nOutsourcing has contributed to further levelling of global inequalities as it has led to general trends of industrialization in the Global South and deindustrialization in the Global North.\n\nEven though outsourcing has promoted a movement of industrial sites from the Global North to Global South regions, it has not been the only reason for the concurrent deindustrialization and industrialization of the North and South respectively. Deindustrialization in more economically and technologically developed regions has also been affected by increased industrial productivity.\n\nThe rise in industrial efficiency which characterized development in developed countries has occurred as a result of labor-saving technological improvements. Although these improvements do not directly reduce employment levels but rather increase output per unit of work, they can indirectly diminish the amount of labor required for fixed levels of output. Likewise, a trending shift in demand towards non-tradable services such as those in the health-care or government sectors has further accelerated deindustrialization in the Global North. Since these tasks cannot be outsourced, the demand for them needs to be met domestically abiding by the local market price. Consequently, a shift in the labor force towards fulfilling these profitable services has mostly taken place at the expense of industry since the agricultural sector in the early industrializing Global North had already been maximizing its labour capacity.\n\nDespite the variety of domestic and international factors affecting deindustrialization in the Global North, those concerning the external influence of the global market have been the most influential ones since 1994.\n\nThe recent industrialization process outsourcing has encouraged in the Global South has taken place at a much faster pace than it did during its beginnings in the North, given that the well-developed technology was already developed, and merely spread to further regions.\n\nThe almost simultaneous industrialization of the developing Global South and deindustrialization of the more developed Global North resulted in an international convergence of incomes.\n\nOutsourcing has been characterized by rapid rates of growth and industrialization in the Global South. Conversely, the Global North has experienced a moderate slowdown in growth. Patterns of global industrialization and deindustrialization are explained by a combination of models in economic geography and economic growth. Models in economic geography illustrate that decreasing communication costs reduce the spatial clustering of industrial development. The lower cost to the spread of ideas improved coordination and communication within corporations across greater geographic distances. This process originated roughly after the international chaos of the World Wars, as a consequence of advancements in information technology during the 1960s. Further adaptations to technological progress, particularly the spread of the internet and liberalization of the telecommunications industry, permitted an acceleration of the movement of ideas and consequently of outsourcing since about the 1980s.\n\nThe pace of urbanization in the Global North decreased considerably relative to its high levels following the Industrial Revolution. Rates of urban growth have been higher in the Global South.\n\nOutsourcing emerged with a new wave of globalization marked by high volumes of trade and capital flows. The increased movement of capital and goods contrasted starkly with the barriers and protectionism prevalent throughout the World Wars and the Great Depression during the Interwar Years.\n\nThe level of migration has remained relatively low, particularly compared to the mass migratory trends which characterized the Industrial Revolution roughly between 1850 and 1914., probably because labor markets are not free now. Countries now have discrimination labor laws, only allow people with citizenship cards live and work free in their territories, even getting a citizenship card is difficult for some one not born in their territory. Free labor markets, discrimination based with a person skills would help reduce outsourcing problems, letting people freely follow their jobs in other countries.\n\nOutsourcing in the Global North led to a rising divergence in domestic employment levels in different tasks within a given industry, making tackling unemployment more difficult for governments as job losses ceased to be primarily sectoral.\n\n\"Outsourcing\" has become a continuing political issue in the United States, having been conflated with offshoring, during the 2004 U.S. presidential election. The political debate centered on outsourcing's consequences for the domestic U.S. workforce. Democratic U.S. presidential candidate John Kerry criticized U.S. firms that outsource jobs abroad or that incorporate overseas in tax havens to avoid paying their \"fair share\" of U.S. taxes during his 2004 campaign, calling such firms \"Benedict Arnold corporations\".\n\nCriticism of outsourcing, from the perspective of U.S. citizens, generally revolves around the costs associated with transferring control of the labor process to an external entity in another country. A Zogby International poll conducted in August 2004 found that 71% of American voters believed that \"outsourcing jobs overseas\" hurt the economy while another 62% believed that the U.S. government should impose some legislative action against companies that transfer domestic jobs overseas, possibly in the form of increased taxes on companies that outsource. One prediction (form 2010) claims that, by 2014, more than 1.3 million positions will disappear because of \"the accelerated movement of work to India ...\" and some other countries willing to accept outsourced jobs. President Obama promoted an act titled 'Bring Jobs Home Act' that would help reshore jobs by giving incentives such as a tax cut or a 20 percent tax credit for moving operations back to the USA. The same bill was reintroduced in the 113th United States Congress as the Bring Jobs Home Act (S. 2569; 113th Congress).\n\nLabor advocates accuse union busting as one possible cause of outsourcing. They argue that as unions are disadvantaged by union busting legislation, workers lose bargaining power and it becomes easier for corporations to fire them and ship their job overseas.\n\nAnother rationale is the high corporate income tax rate in the U.S. relative to other OECD nations, and the practice of taxing revenues earned outside of U.S. jurisdiction, a very uncommon practice. However, outsourcing is not solely a U.S. phenomenon as corporations in various nations with low tax rates outsource as well, which means that high taxation can only partially, if at all, explain US outsourcing. For example, the amount of corporate outsourcing in 1950 would be considerably lower than today, yet the tax rate was actually higher in 1950.\n\nIt is also suggested that lowering the corporate income tax and ending the double-taxation of foreign-derived revenue (taxed once in the nation where the revenue was raised, and once from the U.S.) will alleviate corporate outsourcing and make the U.S. more attractive to foreign companies. However, while the US has a high official tax rate, the actual taxes paid by US corporations may be considerably lower due to the use of tax loopholes, tax havens, and \"gaming the system\". Rather than avoiding taxes, outsourcing may be mostly driven by the desire to lower labor costs (see standpoint of labor above). Sarbanes-Oxley has also been cited as a factor for corporate flight from U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nWhere outsourcing involves the transfer of an undertaking, it is subject to Council Directive 77/187 of 14 February 1977, on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (as amended by Directive 98/50/EC of 29 June 1998; consolidated in Directive 2001/23 of 12 March 2001). Under that directive, rights acquired by employees with the former employer are to be safeguarded when they, together with the undertaking in which they are employed, are transferred to another employer, i.e., the contractor. An example of a case involving such contracting-out was the decision of the European Court of Justice in Christel Schmidt v. Spar- und Leihkasse der früheren Ämter Bordesholm, Kiel und Cronshagen, Case C-392/92 [1994]. Although subsequent decisions have disputed whether a particular contracting-out exercise constituted a transfer of an undertaking (see, for example, Ayse Süzen v. Zehnacker Gebäudereinigung GmbH Krankenhausservice, Case C-13/95 [1997]), in principle, employees of an enterprise outsourcing part of its activities in which they are employed may benefit from the protection offered by the directive.\n\nSeeking to implement the cost-cutting solutions, many Western European firms have been transferring tech projects eastward. For example, Deutsche Bank has some of its software developed in Ukraine, Siemens possess R&D center in Romania. Europe Outsourcing has produced outstanding results and henceforward they are increasing them in numbers.\n\nDespite unfavorable economic conditions from 2007 to 2009, the outsourcing services market continued to flourish in Central and Eastern European. In 2008 when the inflow of investment in Western Europe was down by 48%, it fell by only 9% in Central and Eastern Europe. In Poland alone, during 2009, the year following the global economic downturn, approximately 10,000 jobs were created in business process outsourcing (BPO).\n\nCo-sourcing is a business practice where a service is performed by staff from inside an organization and also by an external service provider. It can be a service performed in concert with a client's existing internal audit department. The scope of work may focus on one or more aspects of the internal audit function. Co-sourcing can serve to minimize sourcing risks, increase transparency, clarity and lend toward better control over the processes outsourced.\n\nExamples of co-sourcing services are supplementing the in-house internal audit staff with specialized skills such as information risk management or integrity services, providing routine assistance to in-house auditing for operations and control evaluations in peak period activity and conducting special projects such as fraud investigation or plant investment appraisals. Another example of co-sourcing is outsourcing part of software development or software maintenance activities to an external organization, while keeping part of the development in-house. Other internal business activities such as HR and administrative tasks can also be co-sourced by employee leasing companies.\n\nIt is an approach to enterprise identity management in which the identity service interacts directly or through some technical footprint with an organization's Information Technology (IT) identity back-end infrastructure: directories, databases, and other identity repositories. The organization and the external service provider typically have a shared responsibility for building, hosting and operating the identity service. The balance of this responsibility can vary depending on the service levels required, and span from an all on-premises deployment, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated within the organization's IT infrastructure and managed on-premises by the external service provider. This contrasts with an \"all in-the-cloud\" service scenario, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated by the service provider in an externally hosted, cloud computing infrastructure.\n\nSome firms have reversed the decision to outsource because the results were not entirely as expected. The circumstances which allow firms to unbundle the different tasks or stages of its manufacturing process into different locations have not been fully determined. Though the nature of the tasks plays a role determining their interconnectedness, other factors such as innovation in the manufacturing process or advances in transport and communication technology also affect the need for direct contact among employees. As the process which ties tasks together within firms remains unclear, there is a degree of uncertainty about which tasks need to remain geographically clustered together. In many cases firms took risks experimenting with outsourcing while lacking a firm understanding of the relationship among internal tasks and its spatial implications.\n\nDespite saving money, companies have often faced unexpected drawbacks from outsourcing, such as miscommunication or lower quality of intermediate products, which end up delaying the overall production process. Another reason for a decrease in outsourcing is that many jobs that were subcontracted abroad have been replaced by technological advances.\n\nAccording to a Deloitte Consulting survey carried out in 2005, a quarter of the companies which had outsourced tasks reversed their strategy. Many big companies like Lenovo considered turning around outsourcing strategies of outsourcing.\n\nPublic opinion in the US and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In the first decade from 2000 to 2010, the US experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the computers and electronics sector. Public disenchantment with outsourcing has not only stirred political responses, as seen in the 2012 US presidential campaigns, but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or offshore jobs.\n\nA 2016 Deloitte survey suggested that companies are no longer reluctant to outsource. Deloitte's survey identified three trends: \n\n"}

{"id": "66178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66178", "title": "Realpolitik", "text": "Realpolitik\n\nRealpolitik (from ; \"realistic\", \"practical\", or \"actual\"; and '; \"politics\", ) is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises. In this respect, it shares aspects of its philosophical approach with those of realism and pragmatism. It is often simply referred to as \"pragmatism\"'\" in politics, e.g. \"pursuing pragmatic policies\". The term \"Realpolitik\" is sometimes used pejoratively to imply politics that are perceived as coercive, amoral, or Machiavellian.\n\nThe term \"Realpolitik\" was coined by Ludwig von Rochau, a German writer and politician in the 19th century. His 1853 book \"Grundsätze der Realpolitik angewendet auf die staatlichen Zustände Deutschlands\" describes the meaning of the term: \n\nHistorian John Bew suggests that much of what stands for modern \"Realpolitik\" today deviates from the original meaning of the term. \"Realpolitik\" emerged in mid-19th century Europe from the collision of the Enlightenment with state formation and power politics. The concept, Bew argues, was an early attempt at answering the conundrum of how to achieve liberal enlightened goals in a world that does not follow liberal enlightened rules.\n\nPublicist, journalist and liberal political reformer Von Rochau coined the term in 1853 and added a second volume in 1869 that further refined his earlier arguments. Rochau, exiled in Paris until the 1848 uprising, returned during the revolution and became a well-known figure in the national liberal party. As the liberal gains of the 1848 revolutions fell victim to coercive governments or were swallowed by powerful social forces such as class, religion and nationalism, Rochau—according to Bew—began to think hard about how the work that had begun with such enthusiasm had failed to yield any lasting results.\n\nHe said that the great achievement of the Enlightenment had been to show that might is not necessarily right. The mistake liberals made was to assume that the law of the strong had suddenly evaporated simply because it had been shown to be unjust. Rochau wrote that \"to bring down the walls of Jericho, the Realpolitiker knows the simple pickaxe is more useful than the mightiest trumpet\". Rochau's concept was seized upon by German thinkers in the mid and late 19th century and became associated with Otto von Bismarck's statecraft in unifying Germany in the mid 19th century. By 1890, usage of the word \"Realpolitik\" was widespread, yet increasingly detached from its original meaning.\n\nWhereas \"Realpolitik\" refers to political practice, the concept of political realism in international relations refers to a theoretical framework aimed at offering explanations for events in the international relations domain. The theory of political realism proceeds from the assumption that states—as actors in the international arena—pursue their interests by practising \"Realpolitik\". Conversely, \"Realpolitik\" can be described as the exercise of policies that are in line with accepted theories of political realism. In either case, the working hypothesis is generally that policy is chiefly based on the pursuit, possession and application of power (see also power politics). However, some international relations realists, such as Kenneth Waltz, have viewed state policy in terms of the pursuit of survival or security, rather than the pursuit of power for its own sake.\n\nSee political realism for branches and antecedents more relevant to contemporary diplomacy and the particular modern, international relations paradigm.\n\nIn the United States, the term is often analogous to power politics while in Germany \"Realpolitik\" has a somewhat less negative connotation, referring to realistic politics in opposition to idealistic (or unrealistic) politics. It is particularly associated with the era of 19th century nationalism. \"Realpolitik\" policies were employed in response to the failed revolutions of 1848 as means to strengthen states and tighten social order.\n\nThe most famous German advocate of \"Realpolitik\" was Otto von Bismarck, the first Chancellor (1862–1890) to Wilhelm I of the Kingdom of Prussia. Bismarck used \"Realpolitik\" in his quest to achieve Prussian dominance in Germany. He manipulated political issues such as the Schleswig-Holstein Question and the Hohenzollern candidature to antagonize other countries and cause wars if necessary to attain his goals. Such policies are characteristic of Bismarck, demonstrating a pragmatic view of the \"real\" political world. Another example was his willingness to adopt some social policies of the socialists such as employee insurance and pensions; in doing so, he used small changes from the top down to avoid the possibility of major change from the bottom up. Likewise, Prussia's seemingly illogical move of not demanding territory from a defeated Austria, a move that later led to the unification of Germany, is an oft-cited example of \"Realpolitik\".\n\nAdolf Hitler's attempt to annex the predominantly German region of Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland in 1938 may also be described as \"Realpolitik\". At first, Hitler unsuccessfully demanded that Czech President Edvard Beneš hand over that region of the country. However, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain subsequently gave the Sudetenland to Hitler in the (ultimately unsuccessful) hope of preventing a war as codified in the Munich Agreement. With Britain a guarantor of Czech independence, Hitler knew that Beneš' opinion on the matter was immaterial if Chamberlain was prepared to give Hitler what he desired.\n\nE. H. Carr was a liberal realist and left-wing British historian and international relations theorist who argued for realistic international policies versus utopian ones. Carr described realism as the acceptance that what exists is right and the belief that there is no reality or force outside history such as God. He argued that in realism there is no moral dimension; and that what is successful is right and what is unsuccessful is wrong. Carr was convinced that the Bolsheviks were destined to win the Russian Civil War and approved of the Prime Minister David Lloyd George's opposition to the anti-Bolshevik ideas of the War Secretary Winston Churchill under the grounds of \"Realpolitik\". In Carr's opinion, Churchill's support of the White Russian movement was folly as Russia was likely to be a great power once more under the leadership of the Bolsheviks.\n\nAmerican \"Realpolitik\" began in the 1960s with the influence of Polish-American Zbigniew Brzezinski, later National Security Adviser to Jimmy Carter. Contrary to McCarthy-era hostility (and John Foster Dulles' talk of the military \"liberation\" of the Eastern Bloc), Brzezinski proposed \"peaceful engagement\" with the Soviet Union while he was advising Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Brzezinski, uninterested in promoting anti-Soviet propaganda for the benefit of the United States, felt the United States would be more successful through frequent interactions with regimes and people under communist rule. Brzezinski knew the tough economic realities of those living in the Eastern Bloc, in particular the permanent shortage of goods; and that their attachment to the Soviet Union was born of historic necessity rather than common ideology. Brzezinski suggested enticing these countries economically and through educational and cultural exchanges that would appeal to intellectuals, followed by favoritism for regimes showing signs of liberalization or less reliance on Moscow. Through this approach, Brzezinski \"offered a realistic, evolutionary alternative to empty political rhetoric\".\n\nHenry Kissinger has been credited with formally introducing the policy of \"Realpolitik\" to the White House as Secretary of State to Richard Nixon. In this context, the policy meant dealing with other powerful nations in a practical manner rather than on the basis of political doctrine or ethics—for instance, Nixon's diplomacy with the People's Republic of China despite American opposition to communism and the previous doctrine of containment. Another example is Kissinger's use of shuttle diplomacy after the 1973 Arab–Israeli war, where he persuaded the Israelis to withdraw partially from the Sinai in deference to the political realities created by the oil crisis.\n\nKissinger generally receives credit for introducing \"Realpolitik\" to American foreign policy. Kissinger himself said that he had never used the term and has said that it is used by both liberal and realist foreign policy thinkers to label, criticize and facilitate a choosing of sides. Kissinger had looked at what he implemented while serving as Secretary of State and United States Security Advisor not in the confines of making \"Realpolitik\" a standard policy, but within the terms of being a statesman. This political mindset can be seen in Kissinger’s book \"A World Restored\" and is pointed out by historian John Bew in his book \"Realpolitik\". Kissinger goes on to say that the role of the statesman is \"the ability to recognize the real relationship of forces and to make this knowledge serve his ends\".\n\nIn this context, one can see how \"Realpolitik\" principles can influence American policy, but not as standard policy. The reach and influence of \"Realpolitik\" is found instead in pragmatic and flexible policy that changes to the needs of the situation. This type of policy making could be seen as recently as in the administration of Barack Obama. Bew makes note of this direction in the Obama administration when Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel remarked in an article in the \"New York Times\" that everyone wanted to break it down into contrasts of idealist and realist, but \"if you had to put him in a category, he's probably more realpolitik, like Bush 41 [...] You’ve got to be cold-blooded about the self-interests of your nation\".\n\nRealpolitik is distinct from ideological politics in that it is not dictated by a fixed set of rules, but instead tends to be goal-oriented, limited only by practical exigencies. Since \"Realpolitik\" is ordered toward the most practical means of securing national interests, it can often entail compromising on ideological principles. For example, during the Cold War the United States often supported authoritarian regimes that were human rights violators in order to theoretically secure the greater national interest of regional stability. After the end of the Cold War, this practice continued.\n\nMost recently, former ambassador Dennis Ross advocated this approach to foreign policy in his 2007 book \"Statecraft: And How to Restore America's Standing in the World\". For the purposes of contrast and speaking in ideal types, political ideologues would tend to favor principle over other considerations. Such individuals or groups can reject compromises which they see as the abandonment of their ideals and so may sacrifice political gain in favor of adhering to principles they believe to be constitutive of long-term goals.\n\nChina has a \"realistic\" tradition dating back thousands of years. Often referred to as Chinese Legalism, the spirit of its content may be most readily recognized by Western viewers through one of its kindred, \"The Art of War\". Chinese administrative organization influenced Western administrative practices not later than the 12th century, playing a significant role in the development of the modern state, including use of the examination.\n\nStarting in the Spring and Autumn period (771–476/403 BC), a trend of \"realistic\" reformers were taken on to advance the material interest of their respective states, with the Qin state founding the first Chinese Empire, Qin dynasty in 221 BCE, ending China's Warring States period. The political theory developed during the era, including that of Confucianism would influence every dynasty thereafter.\n\nThose termed Legalist are more purely \"Realpolitikal\" in contrast to Confucianism and include non-legal Shen Pu-hai derived political technique, which charges the ruler engage in passive observation to determine facts rather than take on too much himself. Sinologist Herrlee G. Creel writes: \"If one wishes to exaggerate, it would no doubt be possible to translate (foundational Realist) Shen Buhai's term Shu, or technique, as 'science', and argue that Pu-hai was the first political scientist,\" though Creel does \"not care to go this far\".\n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period, the prevalent philosophy had dictated war as a gentleman's activity; military commanders were instructed to respect what they perceived to be Heaven's laws in battle. For example, when Duke Xiang of Song was at war with the state of Chu during the Warring States period, he declined an opportunity to attack the enemy force (commanded by Zhu) while they were crossing a river.\n\nThe Qin disregarded this military tradition, taking advantage of their enemy's weaknesses.\n\nAccording to Kenneth Paul Tan of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, \"Chua Beng Huat (1997) argued that the rhetoric of pragmatism in Singapore is ideological and hegemonic in nature, adopted and disseminated in the public sphere by the People's Action Party (PAP) government and institutionalized throughout the state in all its administrative, planning and policy-making functions. It is suggested that by doggedly describing itself as pragmatic, the Singapore state is actually disguising its ideological work and political nature through an assertion of the absence of ideology and politics. Chan Heng Chee (1975) earlier described Singapore as a depoliticized \"administrative state\", where ideology and politics had triumphantly been replaced by rational and scientific modes of public administration\".\n\n\n"}

He co-wrote the song with Ed Grenga (a.k.a. \"Babe Marino\"), who also gave Stevens the stage name \"Red Peters.\" As Peters told Outer Shell Magazine, \"My music director, Babe Marino, and I were messing around with a big band arrangement one day and the words just flowed out. We brought the scratch recording to a party that night and people went shithouse for it. We went on to formally record it with his orchestra along with the Alan Pinchloaf Singers.\"\n\nIn 1990, Peters released \"How's Your Whole... Family?\" as a second single. This led to a full-length release, produced by Grenga, in 1995 for Ugly Sisters Records, \"I Laughed... I Cried... I Fudged My Undies!\" A nationwide radio tour followed, including the Mancow Muller show, the Dr. Demento radio show, and eventually Howard Stern. On his first appearance on Stern's show in 1996, he sang \"A Ballad of a Dog Named Stains.\"\n\nIn 1999, Peters released his 2nd full-length album, \"Ol' Blue Balls Is Back!\" on Ball Bag Records. It was again produced by Grenga.\n\nOn October 8, 2003, Peters and Ball Bag Records signed an exclusive distribution deal with Oglio Entertainment Group, and his music is distributed by Universal Fontana. This led to two single releases, \"I Can't Say These Things\" in 2005, and \"When I Jerkoff, I Think of You\" in 2006. \"The Best of the Red Peters Comedy Music Hour, Vol. #1\", a compilation album of various artists, was the first full-length release with Oglio in 2007. This album consisted of songs and artists featured on his Sirius Howard 101 radio show.\n\nIn 2009, Peters released \"It's A Red Peters Christmas! Vol. 1\", a collection of holiday songs from guests that appeared on his Red Peters Comedy Music Hour holiday radio programs on Sirius XM Howard 101, once again performed by various artists. In 2010, another compilation from his radio show, called \"Red Peters Presents The Summer Song Sizzler\", was released.\n\nIn October 2010, Peters and comic Margaret Cho recorded a cover of the Dick Shreve song, \"The Christmas Gift (Just A Little Christmas Blow Job)\" when Cho was in Boston on her \"Cho Dependent\" national tour, performing at the Wilbur Theater. The song was released as a single on Oglio Records in November 2010.\n\nIn 1976, Stevens founded the music production company Handsome Brothers Music Service with fellow GNP band member Tom Dempsey. The company specializes in commercial music production for television, radio, corporate videos, advertising, and motion pictures. Composer Ed Grenga became a business partner in 1984; besides corporate work, Grenga has produced all of Peters' albums and scored numerous feature films as well. For the 2009 baseball season, Grenga and Stevens created pregame, in-game and post-game music for NESN's broadcasts of Boston Red Sox games. The music debuted on Opening Day in 2009.\n\nIn 2005, Peters started a Sirius Satellite Radio show called \"The Red Peters Comedy Music Hour\" on Howard Stern's \"Howard 101\" channel, as a weekly broadcast. The first show aired November 18, 2005. The show is described as \"uncensored songs, oddities, taboo subjects and the forbidden spoken word.\" In 2010, Peters' show went to a schedule of 8 one-hour specials a year, primarily on holiday weekends.\n\nIn 1997, Peters appeared on Stern's radio show, and shortly thereafter on his CBS late night television show, \"The Howard Stern Radio Show\". He was featured in a live segment from the radio show, and in music video footage of his song, \"The Ballad of a Dog Named Stains\".\n\nPeters appeared in the movie \"Johnny Slade's Greatest Hits\" (\"Meet The Mobsters\") in 2005. Handsome Brothers partner Grenga produced the songs and scored the film. Peters' \"Blow Me (You Hardly Even Know Me)\" was featured in the film's opening scenes, and actor John Fiore sang an arrangement of Peters' song, \"The First Time I Met You\". Peters had a role in the film, playing himself, as a wise cracking stand-up comic.\n\nIn 2008, Peters and singer/songwriter Gregory Roman, star of the short film \"Titler\" that won an Honorable Mention at the Sundance Film Festival in 2000, co-wrote and produced the Nu-vaudeville production, \"Oddvile\". It was a 2-hour show, featuring a variety of music, comedy, and novelty acts. It premiered June 7, 2008, at Boston's Cutler Majestic Theater.\n\nIn August 2011, while vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, Peters is reported to have accidentally farted in front of Barack Obama. \"Mr. Obama was forced from the fiction aisle to the self-help section until the Secret Service deemed the area was clear,\" Peters told the \"Boston Herald\". \"They were polite but not amused. The young daughter (Sasha) was blocking her nose. I was so embarrassed.\" The President's security detail then escorted Peters from the bookstore.\n\n\n\n"}

She was launched on 29 March 1992 and commissioned on 2 April 1993. Homeported at Odessa since March 2014, she is the flagship of the Ukrainian Navy.\n\nBuilt at the Zalyv Shipbuilding yard, the ship was intended to be used by the Soviet Border Troops as \"Kirov\".

At , the slide became the world's tallest water slide when it opened in 2014, surpassing the Kilimanjaro at Aldeia das Águas Park Resort. Following a fatal incident involving a 10-year-old boy in 2016, the ride was closed permanently. Criminal charges led to the arrests of several individuals, including the park's owner and a co-designer of the ride.\n\nIn November 2012, owners of Schlitterbahn Kansas City announced plans for the creation of the world's tallest and fastest water slide, with it opening during their Summer season in 2013. No name was given during the announcement, while specifications on the height of the ride were kept secret in order to ensure that the completed ride would set a world record for its creation. The plans for the water slide were conceived as a spur of the moment idea by Schlitterbahn co-owner Jeff Henry, after he was asked by a team working on Travel Channel's \"Xtreme Waterparks\" what he was working on while attending a trade show. After initial attempts to pitch the idea to vendors at the show failed, Henry decided to build the slide himself, with assistance on the design provided by ride designer John Schooley.\n\nIn November 2013, the ride was officially named Verrückt, the German word for crazy or insane, with the opening date pushed back until the start of the park's 2014 season. When the park opened, delays in construction and testing of the ride led to its opening date being pushed back to June 5, and then June 29, after the lower portion of the ride was rebuilt, to coincide with a television special about the ride; the park later cancelled this opening date and two days of media previews following further delays with the ride. The ride was eventually completed and officially opened on July 10, 2014.\n\nFollowing its opening, Verrückt was voted the world's \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" at the 2014 Golden Ticket Awards.\n\nVerrückt was designed to consist of two drops, the initial being a 17-story plunge, with a five-story uphill mid-section. The ride was designed to accommodate the use of three-person rafts, each weighing and carried up by conveyor to the top of the slide, while riders were required to climb 264 steps to reach the top. To avoid issues with rafts lifting off the slide, rider groups were weighed twice – once at the bottom and again at the top before riding – to make sure that their combined weight was between and , and that no single rider weighed over .\n\nThe starting point of the ride, at , was taller than either Niagara Falls or the foot-to-torch portion of the Statue of Liberty. As it was beyond the that zoning codes permitted, the design required a variance (the height was increased from its initial plan of , which was also above the limit). After the announcement of the ride's height and the certification of its world record on April 25, 2014, Schlitterbahn tore down most of the lower part of the ride, in order to rebuild and re-engineer it after sandbags were seen flying off the ride during testing. As a result, the second drop was changed from 45 degrees to 22 degrees, an extra was added to the uphill portion of the ride to slow down rafts, and a series of metal hoops and netting supported by them were added into areas where rafts had flown off in early testing.\n\nOn August 7, 2016, the 10-year-old son of Kansas state representative Scott Schwab died while riding Verrückt. The death occurred when the raft he was in went airborne and impacted a metal support of the netting, decapitating the child. The other two passengers, both women, were injured in the incident — one suffered a broken jaw, while the other suffered a facial bone fracture and needed stitches. In the immediate aftermath, the park was closed pending an inspection. Although the park reopened three days later, the ride was closed forever.\n\nAn investigation found that the boy, who weighed , had been allowed to sit in the front of the raft, rather than between the two women accompanying him — one weighed , while the other weighed . This led to an uneven weight distribution that contributed to the raft going airborne, despite the cumulative weight of being under the maximum recommended weight of . Engineers who inspected the ride also commented that the ride's netting, used in areas where riders travel up to , \"posed its own hazard because a rider moving at high speeds could easily lose a limb if they hit it\". Their findings revealed that the use of the metal brace and netting system in the design, along with the use of hook and loop straps to restrain the riders, went against guidelines set by ASTM F-24 Committee on Amusement Ride and Devices. According to the guidelines, Verrückt should have incorporated the use of a rigid over-the-shoulder restraint for riders, and an upstop mechanism to prevent the rafts from going airborne. \n\nOn March 23, 2018, a grand jury issued an indictment against Schlitterbahn and Tyler Austin Miles, former director of operations, charging them with involuntary manslaughter, aggravated battery, aggravated child endangerment, and interference with law enforcement. The indictment accused the park of negligence, concealing design flaws, and downplaying the severity of previous injuries reported on the ride. Three days later, on March 26, Jeff Henry was arrested in Cameron County, Texas, in connection with the incident. A day later, on March 27, the Kansas Attorney General's office released a new indictment against Henry, co-designer John Schooley, and Henry & Sons Construction Company — privately-owned by Schlitterbahn — charging them with second-degree murder in addition to 17 other felonies.<ref name=\"Indictment-Henry/Schooley\"></ref> Schooley was arrested at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport after returning from a trip to China on April 2, 2018.\n\nThe 2018 indictment against Schlitterbahn wrote that Henry and Schooley \"lacked technical expertise to design a properly functioning water slide\" and did not perform standard engineering procedures or calculations on how the slide would operate. Instead they used \"crude trial-and-error methods\" to test its performance, out of haste to launch the ride. According to court documents, Schooley conceded that “If we actually knew how to do this, and it could be done that easily, it wouldn’t be that spectacular.”\n\nOn November 22, 2016, Schlitterbahn announced that Verrückt would be demolished following the closure of a criminal investigation. In July 2018, a judge approved a plan by the park to disassemble the ride beginning the following September. The ride's teardown was placed on hold indefinitely in August 2018, resulting from ongoing discussions in multiple court cases that were filed after the incident.\n\nThe first criminal trial began on October 5, 2018. \n\n"}
