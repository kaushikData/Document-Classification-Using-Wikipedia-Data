Mack's show catered primarily to truck drivers who traveled during the late-night hours. Its opening theme music was an instrumental rendition of \"Orange Blossom Special\", performed by Felix Slatkin and his orchestra.\n\nBecause of WBAP's clear channel signal range via skywave at night, Mack's show was heard over most of the continental United States. Mack began his show in 1969. He briefly took his show to Mexican \"border blaster\" station XERF, but returned to WBAP when an agreement for Mack to do his show from his Fort Worth home fell through.\n\nIn addition, Mack hosts the syndicated radio show \"Country Crossroads,\" heard on more than 800 stations across the country, and a similar cable television show on FamilyNet. He also hosts the \"Overdrive Top Ten Countdown,\" a weekly one-hour country music countdown geared toward truckers, in syndication.\n\nMack left WBAP to join XM Satellite Radio on its Open Road channel (XM 171). Two of the other main personalities on Open Road, Dave Nemo and Dale \"The Truckin' Bozo\" Sommers, were Mack's primary competitors before all three left their AM radio stations to join XM. Mack's radio program was heard weekdays on XM channel 13 from 12 Noon to 3 PM Eastern, and rebroadcast from Midnight to 3 AM Eastern.\nOn April 29, 2011 Mack announced that Sirius/XM had terminated his contract to make room for a merger of two of the channels The Roadhouse and Willie's Place into one channel and that this was his final show.\n\nMack was succeeded on his WBAP show by Eric Harley, and the show has since been renamed the \"Midnight Radio Network.\"\n\nIn the country music industry, Mack is also a songwriter. His best-known song is \"Blue,\" one of LeAnn Rimes' biggest hits. The song won Mack the Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1997. Mack also wrote \"Drinkin' Champagne,\" which has been recorded by numerous artists. The song was a hit for Cal Smith in 1968, and again for George Strait 1990 on his album \"Livin' It Up\". Some of his other songs have been recorded by Dean Martin, Ray Price, Jerry Lee Lewis and George Jones.\n\nIn 2000, Mack won the media category award given by the Grand Ole Opry. He was named to the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999, and the Country Music DJ and Radio Hall of Fame in 1982.\n\nBill Mack and his wife, Cynthia \"Sweet Cindy\" make their home in Fort Worth, Texas. They have three children from their marriage, Misty Dawn, Billy Mack III, and Sunday Renee. They have several grandchildren.

The building was mainly a courthouse, but it also served as the seat of the \"Capitano della Verga\". \nIts linking to the palace was a symbolic gesture to convey the fact that the courts were under the jurisdiction of the Order of St. John. The courthouse was also linked to the Bishop's Palace through a now-blocked underground passage, indicating the Church's role in the courts. The building remained a courthouse until 1818.\n\nToday, the Corte Capitanale is Mdina's city hall, being the seat of the city's local council. The council considers the building as inadequate, and in 2012 it requested to move its premises to the Banca Giuratale. It is not regularly open to the public, but the main hall is occasionally open with temporary historical or cultural exhibitions.\n\nThe building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. It is now a Grade 1 national monument and it is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.\n\nThe Corte Capitanale is built in the French Baroque style. The façade is decorated by superimposed Tuscan and Corinthian pilasters, and a cornice along roof level. A balcony is located above the main doorway, and it is decorated with allegorical statues of Justice and Mercy. The inscription \"Legibus et Armis\" (by using laws and arms) is inscribed below the centrepiece of the façade.\n\nThe courthouse incorporates some prison cells and dungeons, which had been built in the 16th century. The building is also linked to a loggia known as Herald's Loggia, from which town criers used to announce decrees to the people.

The island was featured on an early sixteenth century Portuguese map (Ingrams, n.d) but it derives its present name from the East Indian man Latham which rediscovered it in 1758.\n\nThe island was annexed to Zanzibar on 19 October 1898 when British First Minister Sir Lloyd Mathews under the order of the Sultan of Zanzibar visited the island, planted the Zanzibar Flag, and declared it to be under the administration of Zanzibar. Lloyd Mathews arrived on the island on 18 October 1898 with the warship HHS Barawa alongside Captain Arthur Agnew, Zanzibar Port Officer, and Dr. Alfred Andrew Spurrier, a Medical Officer.\n\nFollowing the Plantation of Zanzibar Flag on 19 October 1898, 21-gun salutes were performed as a military honor and the island was officially annexed to the Sultan's authority. An iron house was built; its corner stone was laid and written with \"LATHAM ISLAND, FUNGU KIZIMKAZI UNDER ZANZIBAR SOVEREIGNTY\".\n\nLatham Island is a flat coral island located south-east of Unguja and east of Dar es Salaam. It is roughly long and wide, and has an area of . The island is surrounded by a fringing reef and is oceanic, as it lies off the continental shelf and is surrounded by deep water.\n\nThe island is an important breeding ground for various bird species, namely the masked booby, greater crested tern, sooty tern and the brown noddy. Latham is also thought to be of importance for nesting turtles.\n\n Although the Island is under Zanzibar territorial water, controversy has emerged over the ownership of the Latham Island between Zanzibar and Tanzania Mainland, the Island is ruled by the United Republic of Tanzania and not under the Zanzibar jurisdiction. Some members of the House of Representatives in Zanzibar and Opposition leaders have been complaining about ownership of the Blocks and Latham Island.\n"}

{"id": "4831115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4831115", "title": "Noopolitik", "text": "Noopolitik\n\nIn political science, Noopolitik, formed by a combination of the Greek words νόος \"nóos\" (\"knowledge\") and πολιτικός \"politikós\" (πολίτης \"polítēs\" \"citizen\", from πόλις \"pólis\" \"city\"), is the network-based geopolitics of knowledge. The term was invented by defense experts John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt in a 1999 RAND corporation study and often appears in connection with that of \"smart power\".\n\nNoopolitics is an informational strategy of manipulating international processes through the forming in the general public, by means of mass media, of positive or negative attitudes to the external or internal policies of a state or block of states, to create a positive or negative image of ideas and promulgated moral values.\n\nNoopolitik differs from realpolitik. Although realpolitik is commonly equated with hard power, and seemingly noopolitik with soft power, both are broader in their embodiment of a form of organization. Specifically, realpolitik is not limited to hard power and coercion, but embodies a hierarchical form of organization. Likewise, noopolitik is not limited to reliance on knowledge and soft power, but embodies a networked form of organization.\n\nTiziana Terranova (2007) describes the use of the term 'noopolitics' by Maurizio Lazzarato (2004). \"'Noopolitics' supplements the biopolitics of the species described by Foucault\" (Terranova 2007, 139). \"Against the militarization of communication accomplished by new techniques of power, it is possible to think about the constitution of such publics as counter-weapons, which work by expressing, inventing and creating possible worlds where the moment of resistance (the 'no' by which one refuses to watch, listen or believe) is the starting point for an affirmative activity\" (Terranova 2007, 140). Noyer & Juanals (2008) have also discussed Noopolitik as a means of social control. especially in connection with RAND's Byting back program which was published as research into counter insurgency.\n\nWhile the term initially appeared in association with the concept of the US Revolution in Military Affairs, Noopolitik has also come to describe an interest in the knowledge economy and in particular innovation and R&D to leverage growth and political reach in international relations. Thus Noopolitik may be defined as the use of innovation and knowledge to leverage political intercourses by other means at the international level. Such \"knowledge race\" may be either a means of asserting political independence or of generating a sudden gap in the geopolitical balance of power. The attitude of the People's Republic of China and the ANZUS in the Pacific Ocean has been described as such by (2011).\nProfessor Li Xiguang of Tsinghua University described the stakes of Smart power for the People's Republic of China in a 2010 article on Noopolitik in the Global Times\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1044927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1044927", "title": "Resource management", "text": "Resource management\n\nIn organizational studies, resource management is the efficient and effective development of an organization's resources when they are needed. Such resources may include financial resources, inventory, human skills, production resources, or information technology (IT).\n\nIn the realm of project management, processes, techniques and philosophies as to the best approach for allocating resources have been developed. These include discussions on functional vs. cross-functional resource allocation as well as processes espoused by organizations like the Project Management Institute (PMI) through their Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) methodology of project management. Resource management is a key element to activity resource estimating and project human resource management. Both are essential components of a comprehensive project management plan to execute and monitor a project successfully. As is the case with the larger discipline of project management, there are resource management software tools available that automate and assist the process of resource allocation to projects and portfolio resource transparency including supply and demand of resources. The goal of these tools typically is to ensure that: (i) there are employees within our organization with required specific skill set and desired profile required for a project, (ii) decide the number and skill sets of new employees to hire, and (iii) allocate the workforce to various projects. Within professional services and consulting organizations, the effectiveness of these tools and processes is typically monitored by measuring billable utilization rate.\n\nLarge organizations usually have a defined corporate resource management process which mainly guarantees that resources are never over-allocated across multiple projects. Peter Drucker wrote of the need to focus resources, abandoning a less promising initiatives for every new project taken on, as fragmentation inhibits results. \n\nOne resource management technique is resource leveling. It aims at smoothing the stock of resources on hand, reducing both excess inventories and shortages.\n\nThe required data are: the demands for various resources, forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable, as well as the resources' configurations required in those demands, and the supply of the resources, again forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable.\n\nThe goal is to achieve 100% utilization but that is very unlikely, when weighted by important metrics and subject to constraints, for example: meeting a minimum service level, but otherwise minimizing cost. A Project Resource Allocation Matrix (PRAM) is maintained to visualize the resource allocations against various projects.\n\nThe principle is to invest in resources as stored capabilities, then unleash the capabilities as demanded.\n\nA dimension of resource development is included in resource management by which investment in resources can be retained by a smaller additional investment to develop a new capability that is demanded, at a lower investment than disposing of the current resource and replacing it with another that has the demanded capability.\n\nIn conservation, resource management is a set of practices pertaining to maintaining natural systems integrity. Examples of this form of management are air resource management, soil conservation, forestry, wildlife management and water resource management. The broad term for this type of resource management is natural resource management (NRM).\n\nIn addition, we can use Ishikawa diagram to analyze Man, Money, Material and Machine needed. \n\n"}
