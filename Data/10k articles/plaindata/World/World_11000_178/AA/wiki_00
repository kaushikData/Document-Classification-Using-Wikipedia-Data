Despite the murder of several of its leaders, it has continued to fight for peace, and in 1990 it was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in recognition of its work.\n\nFollowing decades of fighting in the region between guerrilla groups and the Colombian army, later joined in the 1980s by paramilitary fighters, the community of La India had reached breaking point by 1987. A group of peasants asked for a meeting with the guerrillas which took place on May 21, 1987, and asked to be left in peace. The guerrillas accepted the request of the group, and a meeting the following week with the commander of the military forces achieved the same result. Following the meetings the ATCC was formed. Its aim was to promote economic growth and peace in the region by holding talks with all parties involved in the conflict, while avoiding taking sides. The ATCC obtained a government grant for six million pesos to build a community store and two purchase two canoes to provide transport to the area along the Carare River. The organization also developed a six-year plan, cosing almost three thousand million pesos, to develop the region. The ATCC's plan covers six municipalities in the region and has five goals: to create a program of building a culture of peace and symbolic reparation; a health care and community rehabilitation plan; an agroforestry program to restore the environment and work for the community; a program of organizational strengthening and institutional recovery; and the restoration of collective property. The plan was finally approved on December 15, 2012.\n\nThe ATCC's greatest setback was the murder on February 26, 1990 of its co-founder and president Josué Vargas, its secretary Saúl Castañeda, and its technical advisor Miguel Ángel Barajas, along with London-based BBC journalist Silvia Duzán who had been interviewing them in a restaurant in Cimitarra. However, on October 8 of the same year the organization was awarded the Right Livelihood Award (popularly known as the \"Alternative Nobel Prize\") in recognition of its work in standing up to the violence.\n\nDuring the 1990s the ATCC was involved in a struggle to convince local farmers not to accede to the demands of guerrilla groups and plant coca. Between 2001 and 2004 the organization also had to stand up to further outbreaks of violence that took place in the area.\n"}

The operation resulted in the movement of 49,960 people into twenty-one protected villages in the Chiweshe Tribal Trust Land. The people were moved into the protected villages to prevent them from being attacked or killed by the insurgents. Unfortunately the relocation resulted in the deaths of a few of the people being moved most likely due to attempts by the insurgents to prevent the relocation. But despite this unintended and regrettable tragedy the operation was a success due to professionalism of the Rhodesian Security Forces. People in the northern Chiweshe area had been subject to violent political intimidation by ZANLA, and so for the most part moved willingly, but in the southern part of the area, where support for the cadres was a little stronger, a small amount resistance was encountered. The security forces destroyed the old huts after their occupants had moved. \"In the short term, benefits seemed substantial,\" says Cilliers, \"as insurgent activities were severely disrupted in Chiweshe for the following six months.\" The security forces immediately set about a similar operation called \"Overload Two\" in the Madziwa Tribal Trust Lands, which met with further success. \n\nAlthough initially successful, the protected villages ultimately proved counter-productive for the security forces. Cilliers cites the \"lack of emphasis on concurrent socio-economic conditions\" as a negative factor, pointing out the lack of sanitation and other facilities in most of the villages, as well as the fact that they were not sufficiently guarded. Wood agrees, saying that the villages \"were never adequately policed or protected and the people were not involved in their management or persuaded of their necessity.\" Because of the inadequate financial backing for the PVs they were not developed properly, and their locations were often too far from the fields where the villagers grew their crops. \n\nThe village administration was poor to the extent that in numerous cases ZANLA insurgents were able to use them as hiding places. \"Most important of all,\" Wood concludes, the protected villages \"took the people away from the burial sites of their ancestors, which they venerated.\" The PVs lasted until 1978, when they were dismantled. This combined with the effectiveness of the recently formed Selous Scouts to reduce ZANLA influence in the area and force the cadres back to the north, towards Mozambique.\n"}

Before the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, it was known as the Enemy Property Act and is still referred to as such in common parlance. The act is criticized as a tool for appropriating the lands of the minority population.\n\nThis law is the culmination of several successive discriminatory laws against non-Muslims passed while Bangladesh was part of Pakistan.\n\nChronologically, they are:\n\nOn 6 November 2008, the High Court division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh delivered its rule nisi upon the Government on the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provision) (Repeal) Act 1974 and subsequently promulgated Arpita Sampatty Protapyan Ain 2001 and circulars, administrative orders.\n\nThe order calls upon the respondent to show cause as to why instructions issued in the contents of presidential order 29 of 1972, act 45 and 46 of 1974, ordinance No. 92, 93 of 1976, Arpita Sampatty Protapyan Ain 2001 and circulars issued by government that are in contradiction with the fundamental rights and the charter of declaration of Independence of Bangladesh, 10 April 1971, should not be declared to be ultra vires the constitution.The Rule Nisi also stated why the properties so far incorporated in the list as Enemy (Vested) should not be returned to the title holder/successor/legal possession holders and or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper. The Rule is made returnable within 4 weeks from 28 October 2008. \n\nThough renamed as the Vested Property Act in 1974, the law still retains the fundamental ability to deprive a Bangladeshi citizen of his/her property simply by declaration of that person as an enemy of the state. Leaving the country through abandonment is cited as the most common reason for this, and it is frequently the case that Hindu families who have one or several members leaving the country (due to religious atrocities against Hindus, and economic as well as political reasons) have their entire property confiscated due to labeling as enemy.\n\nThe Bangladeshi newspaper \"The Sangbad\" (21 March 1977) reported that at that point in time, according to the government's own figures, 702,335 acres (2,842 km²) of cultivable land and 22,835 homes were listed as enemy property. \n\nMuch of the property of murdered Hindu politician Dhirendranath Datta was confiscated by the Bangladesh government after independence in 1971 . Because Datta's body was never found after he was arrested by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War, an affidavit was brought forward that it could not be concluded that Datta had not voluntarily left the country.\n\nThe family property of Nobel Prize–winning economist Amartya Sen had been confiscated by the Pakistan government. In 1999, the Bangladesh government announced that it was investigating opportunities to return the property to Sen's family.\n\nA seminal book by Professor Abul Barkat of Dhaka University, \"Inquiry into Causes and Consequences of Deprivation of Hindu Minorities in Bangladesh through the Vested Property Act\", was published in 2000. It demonstrated that 925,050 Hindu households (40% of Hindu families in Bangladesh) have been affected by the Enemy Property Act. This included 748,850 families dispossessed of agricultural land. The total amount of land lost by Hindu households as a result of this discriminatory act was estimated at 1.64 million acres (6,640 km²), which is equivalent to 53 per cent of the total land owned by the Hindu community and 5.3 per cent of the total land area of Bangladesh.\n\nThe survey also showed that the beneficiaries of the land grab through the act cut across all party lines. The political affiliation of direct beneficiaries of appropriated property was:\n\nThe greatest appropriation of Hindu property took place immediately after independence during the first Awami League government (1972–75) and during the first period of rule of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (1976-1980). Barkat's work also showed that since 1948, 75% of the land of religious minorities in East Pakistan and subsequent Bangladesh had been confiscated through provisions of the act.\n\nBarkat also emphasized that less than 0.4% of the population of Bangladesh has benefited from the Enemy Property Act, demonstrating that this law has been abused by those in power through corruption, with no demonstrated sanction by the population at large.\n\nThe law in its implementation has been seen as a major driver behind the reduction of the Bangladeshi Hindu population, which has declined from an estimated 30% in 1947, to 17% in 1965 to 16% today, representing a loss of around 11 million people. Most of this population left for India, while the more affluent Bangladeshi Hindus leaving due to the act have moved to USA, Canada, Europe and Australia.\n\nDuring Bangladesh's first three decades of independence many politicians made empty promised to repeal the act. The first government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman vowed to repeal any laws that contradicted the values of the newly liberated country; the Enemy Property Act contravened non-communal provisions of the new constitution. But instead of being repealed it was sustained under a new name in 1974.\n\nFinally in the run up to the 2001 election Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League succeeded in a drive to repeal the act. The Vested Properties Return Act (2001) was implemented (in a session boycotted by the opposition BNP and Jamaat members) in an effort to make amends for the confiscated property. However little progress has been made in returning or compensating lost property under the Khaleda Zia government from 2001-2006.\nIn 2008, [HRCBM (Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities)] filed a writ before Bangladesh Supreme Court under article 102 of the constitution.\n\nCongressman Crowley of the Bangladesh-American caucus has called for the repeal of the act , as have several Bangladeshi politicians and human rights activists. The current opposition Awami League has vowed to repeal the act if returned to power in the next elections, even though it has yet to acknowledge its own participation in implementation of the act during the 1972-75 period.\n\nAn international conference organized by several Hindu activist groups held in London on 16 June 2005 was addressed by, among others, Lord Avebury of the British House of Lords and called for repeal of the act. \n\nThe law has been highlighted by the U.S. Department of State and Amnesty International as a major human rights concern that has contributed to internal displacement, emigration and disenfranchisement. \n\n\n"}
