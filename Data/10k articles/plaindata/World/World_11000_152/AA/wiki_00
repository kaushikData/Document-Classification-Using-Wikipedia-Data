In the federation the ATUC had a large influence in the new assembly and to prevent it seizing control of the federation in 1962 the former Colony of Aden had joined the Federation of South Arabia so that Aden's pro-British assembly members could counter the ATUC's influence. \n\nOn 30 November 1967 the State of Aden became part of the independent People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, also known as South Yemen, and the ATUC became the main trade union of that state. \n\nWhen South Yemen united with the Yemen Arab Republic, also known as North Yemen, on 22 May 1990, the Aden Trade Union Congress merged with the General Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions in order to form the Yemeni Confederation of Labor Unions.\n\nThe ATUC was affiliated to the World Federation of Trade Unions.\n"}

{"id": "1888038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888038", "title": "Au jus", "text": "Au jus\n\nAu jus () is a French culinary term meaning \"with juice\". It refers to meat dishes prepared or served together with a light gravy, or broth, made from the juices given off by the meat as it is cooked. In French cuisine, cooking \"au jus\" is a natural way to enhance the flavour of dishes, mainly chicken, veal, and lamb. In American cuisine, the term is mostly used to refer to a light sauce for beef recipes, which may be served with the food or placed on the side for dipping.\n\nIn order to prepare a natural \"jus\", the cook may simply skim off the fat from the juices left after cooking and bring the remaining meat stock and water to a boil. \"Jus\" can be frozen for six months or longer, but the flavor may suffer after this time.\n\nAmerican recipes \"au jus\" often use soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, white or brown sugar, garlic, beets, carrots, onion, or other ingredients to make something more like a gravy. The American \"jus\" is sometimes prepared separately, rather than being produced naturally by the food being cooked. An example could be a beef \"jus\" made by reducing beef stock to a concentrated form, (also known as \"Glace de Viande\") to accompany a meat dish. It is typically served with the French dip sandwich.\n\n\"Jus\" can also be made by extracting the juice from the original meat and combining it with another liquid e.g. red wine (thus forming a red wine \"jus\").\n\nA powdered product described as \"jus\" is also sold, and is rubbed into the meat before cooking or added afterwards. Powdered forms generally use a combination of salt, dried onion, and sometimes sugar as primary flavoring agents.\n\nIn the United States, the phrase \"au jus\" is often misused as a noun, owing to its having been corrupted in culinary references into the noun form: rather than a \"sandwich au jus\", the menu may read \"sandwich with au jus\".\n\n\n"}

Some Irish historians prefer to use this term instead of Anglo-Norman because many of the Anglo-Norman knights who invaded Ireland in 1170 originated in modern-day Wales. However, it is worth noting that south Wales was under English control at this point in history and the Anglo-Normans living in south Wales owed their allegiance to the king of England, not a native Welsh prince. Contemporary Irish accounts of this period simply called the incomers \"Saxain\", which means \"Saxon\", i.e. \"English\".\n\nThe term Cambro-Norman is rarely used even in Ireland. The Normans who invaded Ireland are commonly described as Anglo-Normans by modern historians or simply English.\n\nRichard de Clare, better known as Strongbow, has been described by some Irish historians as a Cambro-Norman rather than an Anglo-Norman. The de Clares held lands in Pembrokeshire and Glamorgan, but their base was in Chepstow, which, although is now a border settlement in Wales, was part of the English county of Herefordshire at the time. Strongbow also held lands in Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Suffolk and is believed to have retreated to his English holdings when the Welsh began to attack his territory in Netherwent. Strongbow was living in England when he was contacted by Diarmaid MacMurrough, the king of Leinster. \n\nIn addition to such Cambro-Norman lords, some of Ireland's most common names, including Walsh and Griffith, came from indigenous Welsh families who came with the Norman invasion. (The surname \"Walsh\" itself, or in Irish \"Breathnach\", \"Briton\", means \"Welshman\", and was applied by the Irish to Welsh who didn't have a surname). Other indigenous Welsh surnames, such as Taaffe which came at this time, became very important families within the Pale.\n\nProbably the best known Cambro-Norman surname, also called Hiberno-Norman, is Costello (see also Gilbert de Angulo). Other Cambro-Norman families include the Butlers, the Joyces and the Barretts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31371717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31371717", "title": "Italian nationalism", "text": "Italian nationalism\n\nItalian nationalism seeks to preserve and foster the national identity of Italy. The romantic (or soft) version of Italian nationalism is known as Italian patriotism. The integral (or hard) version of Italian nationalism is known as Italian fascism. \n\nItalian nationalism traces its origins to ancient Rome and the Renaissance. Italian nationalism first arose as a potent political force in the 1830s in the Italian peninsula under the leadership of Giuseppe Mazzini. It served as a cause for \"Risorgimento\" in the 1860s to 1870s. Italian nationalism became strong again in World War I with Italian irredentist claims to territories held by Austria-Hungary, and during the era of Italian Fascism.\n\nThe origins of Italian nationalism have been traced to the Renaissance where Italy led a European revival of classical Greco-Roman style of culture, philosophy, and art. Renaissance-era diplomat and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli in his work \"The Prince\" (1532) appealed to Italian patriotism urging Italians \"to seize Italy and free her from the Barbarians\", the \"Barbarians\" he referred to were foreign powers occupying the Italian Peninsula.\n\nWhen France started to annex Corsica in the 18th century (and then incorporated during Napoleon's empire the regions of Piemonte, Liguria, Toscana and Lazio), the first movements to defend Italy's existence aroused with Paoli revolt and were later followed by the birth of the so-called \"irredentism\".\nPaoli was sympathetic to Italian culture and regarded his own native language as an Italian dialect (Corsican is an Italo-Dalmatian tongue closely related to Tuscan and Sicilian). He was considered by Niccolò Tommaseo, who collected his \"Lettere\" (Letters), as one of the precursors of the Italian irredentism. The so-called \"Babbu di a Patria\" (\"Father of the fatherland\"), as Pasquale Paoli was nicknamed by the Corsican Italians, wrote in his Letters the following appeal in 1768 against the French:\n\"We are Corsicans by birth and sentiment, but first of all we feel Italian by language, origins, customs, traditions; and Italians are all brothers and united in the face of history and in the face of God ... As Corsicans we wish to be neither slaves nor \"rebels\" and as Italians we have the right to deal as equals with the other Italian brothers ... Either we shall be free or we shall be nothing... Either we shall win or we shall die (against the French), weapons in hand ... The war against France is right and holy as the name of God is holy and right, and here on our mountains will appear for Italy the sun of liberty...\"\n\nThe initial important figure in the development of Italian nationalism was Giuseppe Mazzini, who became a nationalist in the 1820s. In his political career, Mazzini held as objectives the liberation of Italy from the Austrian occupation, indirect control by Austria, princely despotism, aristocratic privilege, and clerical authority. Mazzini was captivated by ancient Rome that he considered the \"temple of humanity\" and sought to establish a united Italy as a \"Third Rome\" that emphasized Roman spiritual values that Italian nationalists claimed were preserved by the Catholic Church. Mazzini and Italian nationalists in general promoted the concept of \"Romanità\" (the Roman-ness), which claimed that Roman culture made invaluable contributions to the Italian and Western civilization. Since the 1820s, Mazzini supported a revolution to create a utopia of an ideal Italian republic based in Rome. Mazzini formed revolutionary patriotic Young Italy society in 1832. Upon Young Italy breaking apart in the 1830s, Mazzini reconstituted it in 1839 with the intention to gain the support of workers' groups. However, at the time Mazzini was hostile to socialism due to his belief that all classes needed to be united in the cause of creating a united Italy rather than divided against each other.\n\nVincenzo Gioberti in 1843 in his book \"On the Civil and Moral Primacy of the Italians\", advocated a federal state of Italy led by the Pope.\n\nCamillo Benso, the future Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia and afterwards the Kingdom of Italy, worked as an editor for the nationalist Italian newspaper \"Il Risorgimento\" in the 1840s. Cavour was a clear example of civic nationalism with a high consideration for values including freedom, tolerance, equality, and individual rights compatible with a sober nationalism.\n\nEconomic nationalism influenced businessmen and government authorities to promote a united Italy. Prior to unification, tariff walls held between the Italian states and the disorganized railway system prevented economic development of the peninsula. Prior to the revolutions of 1848, Carlo Cattaneo advocated an economic federation of Italy.\n\nSupporters of Italian nationalism ranged from across the political spectrum: it appealed to both conservatives and liberals. The Revolutions of 1848 resulted in a major development of the Italian nationalist movement. Liberalization of press laws in Piedmont allowed nationalist activity to flourish.\n\nFollowing the Revolutions of 1848 and the liberalization of press laws, the Italian nationalist organization, called the Italian National Society, was created in 1857 by Daniele Manin and Giorgio Pallevicino. The National Society was created to promote and spread nationalism to political moderates in Piedmont and raised money, held public meetings, and produced newspapers. The National Society helped to establish a base for Italian nationalism amongst the educated middle class. By 1860, the National Society influenced dominant liberal circles in Italy and won over middle class support for the union of Piedmont and Lombardy.\n\nThe statesman Daniele Manin seems to have believed in Italian unification years before Camillo Benso of Cavour, who actually unified the country with Giuseppe Garibaldi through diplomatic and military actions. During the 1856 Congress of Paris, Manin talked with Cavour about several plans and strategies to achieve the unification of Italy; Cavour clearly considered those plans vain things, and after the meeting wrote that Manin had talked about \"l'unità d'Italia ed altre corbellerie\" (\"the unity of Italy and other nonsense\").\n\nThe Risorgimento was an ideological movement that helped incite the feelings of brotherhood and nationalism in the imagined Italian community, which called for the unification of Italy and the pushing out of foreign powers. Literature, music, and other outlets of expression frequently alluded back to the glorious past of Rome and the miraculous feats their ancestors had accomplished in defending their homeland and kicking out the foreign occupants. \n\nAfter the unification of Italy was completed in 1870, the Italian government faced domestic political paralysis and internal tensions, resulting in it resorting to embarking on a colonial policy to divert the Italian public's attention from internal issues.\n\nIn these years, one of the most prominent political figures was Francesco Crispi, whose actions as prime minister were characterised by a nationalism that often appeared as a form of obsession for the national unity and defence from hostile foreign countries. Italy managed to colonize the East African coast of Eritrea and Somalia, but failed to conquer Ethiopia with 15,000 Italians dying in the war and being forced to retreat. Then, Italy waged war with the Ottoman Empire from 1911 to 1912 and gained Libya and the Dodecanese Islands from Turkey. However, these attempts to gain popular support from the public failed, and rebellions and violent protests became so intense that many observers believed that the young Kingdom of Italy would not survive.\n\nTired of the internal conflicts in Italy, a movement of bourgeois intellectuals led by Gabriele d'Annunzio, Gaetano Mosca, and Vilfredo Pareto declared war on the parliamentary system, and their position gained respect among Italians. D'Annunzio called upon young Italians to seek fulfillment in violent action and put an end to the politically maneuvering parliamentary government. The Italian Nationalist Association (\"ANI\") was founded in Florence in 1910 by the jingoist nationalist Enrico Corradini who emphasized the need for martial heroism, of total sacrifice of individualism and equality to one's nation, the need of discipline and obedience in society, the grandeur and power of ancient Rome, and the need for people to live dangerously. Corradini's ANI's extremist appeals were enthusiastically supported by many Italians.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Italy initially maintained neutrality, despite its official alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary since 1882 on the grounds that Germany and Austria-Hungary were waging an aggressive war that it refused to take part in. In 1915, Italy eventually decided to enter the war on the British and French side against Austria-Hungary and Germany.\n\nNationalist pride soared in Italy after the end of hostilities in November 1918, with the victory of Italy and Allied forces over Austria-Hungary and the seizure by Italy of former Austro-Hungarian territories. Italian nationalism became a major force at both elite and popular levels until 1945, when popular democracy became a much more important force.\n\nFreemasonry was an influential semi-secret force in Italian politics with a strong presence among professionals and the middle class across Italy, as well as among the leadership in parliament, public administration, and the army. The two main organisation were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy. They had 25,000 members in 500 or more lodges. Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, public opinion. and the leading political parties in support of Italy’s joining the Allies. traditionally, Italian nationalism focused on unification, and undermining the power of the Catholic Church. In 1914-15 they dropped the traditional pacifistic rhetoric and used instead the powerful language of Italian nationalism. Freemasonry had always promoted cosmopolitan universal values, and by 1917 onwards they demanded a League of Nations to promote a new post-war universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations. \n\nItaly's demands in the Paris peace settlement of 1919 were not fully achieved: Italy did attain Trentino, Trieste, the Istrian peninsula, and South Tyrol from Austria-Hungary, though other territories previously promised to Italy were not given to it.\n\nIn particular, Italian nationalists were enraged by the Allies denying Italy the right to annex Fiume, that had a slight majority Italian population but was not included in Italy's demands agreed with the Allies in 1915, and a larger part of Dalmatia which had a vast majority Slavic population and an Italian minority, claiming that Italian annexation of large part of Dalmatia would violate Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. D'Annunzio responded to this by mobilizing two thousand veterans of the war who seized Fiume by force; this action was met with international condemnation of d'Annunzio's actions but was supported by a majority of Italians. Though d'Annunzio's government in Fiume was forced from power, Italy annexed Fiume a few years later.\n\nThe seizure of power by the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini as Prime Minister of Italy in 1922 and his development of a fascist totalitarian state in Italy involved appeal to Italian nationalism, advocating a Roman-like Italian Empire in the Mediterranean Sea. Mussolini sought to build closer relations with Germany and the United Kingdom while showing hostility towards France and Yugoslavia.\n\nAfter the fall of Fascism and following the birth of the Republic, the interest in Italian nationalism by scholars, politicians and the masses was relatively low, mainly because of its close relation with Fascism and consequently with bad memories of World War II. The only notable and active political party who clearly declared Italian nationalism as its main ideology was the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (\"MSI\"), which became the fourth largest party in Italy by the early 1960s. In these years, Italian nationalism was considered an ideology linked to right-wing political parties and organisations. Nevertheless, two significant events seemed to revitalise Italian nationalism among Italians, the first one in 1953 with the Question of Trieste when the claim of Italy on the full control of the city of Trieste was largely endorsed by most of the Italian society with patriotic demonstrations, and the second one in 1985 during the Sigonella crisis between Italy and the United States. \n\nIn the 2000s, Italian nationalism seemed to gain a moderate support by the society, in particular during important days such as the National Day Festa della Repubblica (Republic day) and the Anniversary of the Liberation. The President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has often praised patriotism among Italians by mentioning in his speeches national events, including the Risorgimento or the Resistenza, and national symbols like the Flag of Italy and the National Anthem, although he seems to want to stress self-confidence rather than plain nationalism. In 2011, the 150th Anniversary of Italian Unification showed a moderately renewed interest in Italian nationalism among the society. Nationalist ideologies are often present during Italian anti-globalisation protests. Today, Italian nationalism is still mainly supported by right-wing political parties like Brothers of Italy and minor far-right political parties like The Right, CasaPound, Forza Nuova and Tricolour Flame. Nonetheless, in recent times Italian nationalism has been occasionally embraced as a form of banal nationalism by liberal parties like Forza Italia, centrist parties like the Union of the Centre or even by centre-left parties like the Democratic Party.\n\nItalian nationalism has also faced a great deal of opposition from within Italy itself. Regionalism and municipal identities have challenged the concept of a unified Italian identity, like those in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Naples, Sardinia, Sicily and Veneto. Such regional identities evoked strong opposition after the Piedmontese-led unification of Italy to plans for \"Piedmontization\" of Italy. Italian identity has also been long strained by an ever growing North-South divide that developed partly from the economic differences of a highly industrialized North and a highly agricultural South.\n\n\n\n"}

He repeats the phrase \"You said that the one that can tear us apart will never be born\" and also tells her that \"life is a storm, stronger than us\" in his attempts to rationalise the breakup. It appears that he is as despondent about the end of the relationship as he believes she will be, but no reason for it is offered.\n\nThe song was performed eleventh on the night (following Belgium's Jacques Raymond & Lily Castel with Goeiemorgen, morgen and preceding Sweden's Family Four with Vita vidder). At the close of voting, it had received 91 points, placing 5th in a field of 18.\n\nIt was succeeded as Italian representative at the 1972 Contest by Nicola di Bari with \"I giorni dell'arcobaleno\".\n\nAlso, this was the first year that the ESC decided to have preview videos promoting the songs competing in the contest. Apparently, Massimo's video was filmed in color, but the location of the shoot is pretty sketchy, since the Italian TV network, RAI didn't convert to color TV until 1977. Plus Massimo's appearance looks a lot different from his appearance at the ESC. Apparently the song and preview video were both recorded in 1970. In the video, he demonstrates all of his emotions in the song very well.\n\nIn conclusion, it was rumored that he was favored to win the contest, since he was asked to record the song in Spanish, French, German and English. However, only the French and Spanish versions have been heard.\n"}

It is also the country's official international broadcasting station.\n\nMR is managed and primarily funded by the Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (, abbreviated MTVA). This government organization, formed in 2011, also manages the public service broadcasters Magyar Televízió and Duna Televízió as well as the Hungarian news agency Magyar Távirati Iroda.\n\nOn 1 July 2015, Magyar Rádió as well as the three other public media organizations managed by the MTVA were merged into a single organization called Duna Media Service ().<ref name=\"MTVA/Duna Media Service Announcement\"></ref> This organization is the legal successor to Magyar Rádió and is an active member of the European Broadcasting Union.\n\nWith its headquarters in Budapest and several regional offices around the country, MR is responsible for public service broadcasting throughout the Hungarian Republic. As well as maintaining nine regional studios, the corporation produces three nationwide Hungarian-language radio channels (\"Kossuth\", \"Petőfi\", and \"Bartók\") covering the full range of public-service radio provision, and a fourth channel (\"MR4\") aimed at the country's linguistic minorities.\n\nNamed after Lajos Kossuth, the channel is the official radio station of Hungary. It is the flagship channel of the Hungarian Radio. Created in 1925, the station has over 3 million listeners per day. It primarily broadcasts news, including interviews, discussions, reports and other speech-based programmes.\n\nNamed after the poet Sándor Petőfi, the station is aimed at the younger generation and broadcasts pop music.\n\nNamed after the composer Béla Bartók, this is a dedicated classical music station. It hosts high culture talk programmes in addition to orchestral and opera music. Supposedly, only a few thousand people listen to this station and proposals to terminate Rádió Bartók have been made several times, but never enacted.\n\nThis radio channel airs programmes in languages of national minorities of Hungary.\n\nParliamentarian broadcasts.\n\nNamed after Pista Dankó, this radio station airs regional content throughout Hungary, plays folk music and broadcasts operetta shows. It is available round the clock on the internet and FM. Also it broadcasts via mediumwave on weekdays from 4:30am to 9:05pm and on weekends from 5:00am to 9:05pm. Then the station's frequencies are handed over to Kossuth Rádió for the rest of the night.\n\nEver since its foundation, the Hungarian Radio P.L.C. has been a \"citadel\" of domestic information, and cultural life. Since December 1, 1925, the institution has had a decisive role in forming the Hungarian public opinion, and general taste.\n\nIt is true in spite of the fact that regular television broadcasts were launched in Hungary in 1958. Forty years later, in 1998, the dual media system was formed. Owing to that a regular competition started between the different mass media channels. Since commercial television and radio stations flooded the market primarily with entertainment industry products, the value-centered approach and program structure of the public service radio makes it, if possible, even more important to preserve its culture creating and broadcasting functions.\n\nHungarian Radio is a partner to the domestic audience and a link with the Hungarians over the borders, a chance for them to retain their national identity. Hungarian Radio could use the slogan often heard in radio commercials: \"From clear source only\". The buildings and studios of the Radio are located in Budapest, in the block between Bródy Sándor Street and Pollack Mihály Square. There are also two beautiful palaces in this area, one of them was owned earlier by the Eszterházy’s and the other one by the Károlyi family. The construction of Studio No. 6, the big orchestra studio, is linked with Georg von Békésy’s name, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his acoustic researches in 1961.\n\nOn July 1, 2007 Radio Budapest cancelled the programming in foreign languages.\n\nThe main theatrical director of Magyar Rádió is Otto Solymosi.\n\nIn 1974, Locomotiv GT's Locomotiv GT (Dunhill Records 811) was released with the slogan \"Radio Budapest Loves You !\"\n\n\n"}

The Council was established at an implementation conference held in London, United Kingdom on December 8 and 9, 1995, subsequent to the completion of the negotiations of the accord the preceding month. The Council is, in effect, the realization, through the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the international community's governance of Bosnia and Herzegovina after signature of the Dayton Agreement. This international control over Bosnia and Herzegovina is to last until the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustainable. \n\nThe PIC comprises 55 countries and agencies that support the peace process in many different ways - by assisting it financially, providing troops for SFOR, or directly running operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is also a fluctuating number of observers.\n\nSince the London conference, the PIC has come together at the ministerial level another six times to review progress and define the goals of peace implementation for the coming period: in June 1996 in Florence, Italy; in December 1996 for a second time in London; in December 1997 in Bonn, Germany; in December 1998 in Madrid, Spain, in May 2000 and February 2007 in Brussels, Belgium. \n\nThe PIC clarifies the responsibilities of the High Representative as the main implementing body of the civilian part of the Dayton Agreement, as set out in Annex 10 the Dayton Agreement. For example, the 1997 Bonn session provided the Office of the High Representative with the so-called \"Bonn authority\" to dismiss elected and non-elected officials who obstruct the implementation of the Dayton Agreement. The High Representative from 2006-2007, Christian Schwarz-Schilling, used this power sparingly, to promote confidence in elected domestic government. This strategy was reversed by the new appointee to that post, Miroslav Lajčák, who imposed several decisions on his first day at work.\n\nThe London peace implementation conference established the Steering Board of the PIC to work under the chairmanship of the High Representative as the executive arm of the PIC.\n\nThe Steering Board members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom, United States, Presidency of the European Union, European Commission, and Organisation of the Islamic Conference, represented by Turkey.\n\nThe Steering Board provides the High Representative with political guidance.

He went to school in Maribo and later received a military education in Copenhagen where he became a lieutenant in the engineering troops in 1850 and a senior lieutenant in 1853.\n\nIn 1858, just 28 years old, he was appointed to \"stadskonduktør\" in Copenhagen and resigned from the army with status of captain. In 1859 he instigated systematic address numbering and in 1860–66 he surveyed all taxable properties in the city.\n\nKrak resigned from his position as \"stadskonduktør\" in Copenhagen in 1898.\n\nIn 1862, Krak was awarded a license to publish a city directory for the Greater Copenhagen area. The work had been instigated by Hans Holck in 1770 but had only been sparsely updated for decades. He completely reorganized and modernized the publication with inspiration from foreign capitals before publishing his first city directory in 1863. In 1902 he passed the publication of Kraks Vejviser (Krak's Road Ditectory) on to his son Ove Krak.\n\nKrak married Charlotte Henriette an. der Recke (27 November 1828 - 30 May1897) on 16 November 1858 in the Garrison Church in Copenhagen. She was the daughter of senior lieutenant and later Road Inspector Gengeal on Funen Peter Blankenborg Prydz van der Recke (1793–1847) and his wife Caroline Cecilie Petersen (1795–1868).\n\nKrak is buried in the Garrison Cemetery in Copenhagen.\n\n"}
