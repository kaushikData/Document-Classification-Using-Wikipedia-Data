Apolo is considered the principal pioneer of the Anglican church in the Belgian Congo. He was commemorated in the Anglican Calendar of Saints on May 30.\n\nHe was born, along with a twin brother, in 1864 in Kiwanda, Uganda. His parents originally named him Waswa Munubi. Waswa grew up the son of peasants who apprenticed him to a witch doctor, but when he discovered the man tricking people out of their possessions, he left him to learn about Islam, which had been recently brought to the chief Kabaka Mutesa's court by Arab traders.\n\nWhen Waswa turned 13, H. M. Stanley, who had discovered David Livingstone in 1872, paid a visit to Mutesa's court and persuaded the chief to begin \"reading\" in the Christian religion. The chief was probably more impressed with Stanley's guns than with his Bible, for Mutesa had already parted ways with the Arabs and now needed protection. But the chief's welcome opened the door for his people to embrace Christianity.\n\nStanley's expedition opened the way for other missionaries too, notably Alexander MacKay, who arrived in 1878. Waswa credits MacKay with planting seeds of belief in his life. \"When I looked at the European,\" he wrote, \"his eyes sparkled with kindness.\" Mackay organized a church, and members of the chief's court began attending his classes.\n\nHe took the name Apolo at his baptism in 1895 after the Apollos of the Bible. \nHe was given the name \"Kivebulaya,\" meaning \"from Europe,\" because he always wore a suit under his cassock.\n\n"}

{"id": "193778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193778", "title": "Bretton Woods Conference", "text": "Bretton Woods Conference\n\nThe Bretton Woods Conference, formally known as the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, was the gathering of 730 delegates from all 44 Allied nations at the Mount Washington Hotel, situated in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States, to regulate the international monetary and financial order after the conclusion of World War II.\n\nThe conference was held from July 1–22, 1944. Agreements were signed that, after legislative ratification by member governments, established the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nEarly in the Second World War, John Maynard Keynes of the British Treasury and Harry Dexter White of the United States Treasury Department independently began to develop ideas about the financial order of the postwar world. (See below on Keynes's proposal for an International Clearing Union.) After negotiation between officials of the United States and United Kingdom, and consultation with some other Allies, a \"Joint Statement by Experts on the Establishment of an International Monetary Fund,\" was published simultaneously in a number of Allied countries on April 21, 1944. On May 25, 1944, the U.S. government invited the Allied countries to send representatives to an international monetary conference, \"for the purpose of formulating definite proposals for an International Monetary Fund and possibly a Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\" (The word \"International\" was only added to the Bank's title late in the Bretton Woods Conference.) The United States also invited a smaller group of countries to send experts to a preliminary conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to develop draft proposals for the Bretton Woods conference. The Atlantic City conference was held from June 15–30, 1944.\n\nThe Bretton Woods Conference had three main results: (1) Articles of Agreement to create the IMF, whose purpose was to promote stability of exchange rates and financial flows. (2) Articles of Agreement to create the IBRD, whose purpose was to speed reconstruction after the Second World War and to foster economic development, especially through lending to build infrastructure. (3) Other recommendations for international economic cooperation. The Final Act of the conference incorporated these agreements and recommendations.\n\nWithin the Final Act, the most important part in the eyes of the conference participants and for the later operation of the world economy was the IMF agreement. Its major features were:\n\nThe seminal idea behind the Bretton Woods Conference was the notion of open markets. In his closing remarks at the conference, its president, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, stated that the establishment of the IMF and the IBRD marked the end of economic nationalism. This meant countries would maintain their national interest, but trade blocs and economic spheres of influence would no longer be their means. The second idea behind the Bretton Woods Conference was joint management of the Western political-economic order, meaning that the foremost industrial democratic nations must lower barriers to trade and the movement of capital, in addition to their responsibility to govern the system.\n\nThe highest body of the Bretton Woods Conference was the plenary session, which met only in the first and last days of the conference and existed mainly to confirm decisions reached by the lower bodies.\n\nThe conference conducted its major work through three \"commissions.\" Commission I dealt with the IMF and was chaired by Harry Dexter White, Assistant to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and the chief American negotiator at the conference. Commission II dealt with the IBRD and was chaired by John Maynard Keynes, economic adviser to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and the chief British negotiator at the conference. Commission III dealt with \"other means of international financial cooperation\" and was chaired by Eduardo Suárez, Mexico's Minister of Finance and the leader of the Mexican delegation. It was a venue for ideas that did not fall under the other two commissions.\n\nEach commission had a number of committees, and some committees had subcommittees. Every country at the conference was entitled to send delegates to all meetings of the commissions and the \"standing committees,\" but other committees and subcommittees had restricted membership, to allow them to work more efficiently. Except when registering final approval or disapproval of proposals, the work of the conference generally proceeded by negotiation and informal consensus rather than by formal voting. When voting occurred, each country had one vote.\n\nThe main goal of the conference was to achieve an agreement on the IMF. Enough consensus existed that the conference was also able to achieve an agreement on the IBRD. Doing so required extending the conference from its original closing date of July 19, 1944 to July 22.\n\nBecause the United States was the world's largest economy at the time, and the main prospective source of funds for the IMF and IBRD, the U.S. delegation had the largest influence on the proposals agreed to at Bretton Woods.\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements (BIS) became an object of scrutiny when the Norwegian delegation put forth evidence that the BIS was involved in war crimes.\n\nThe BIS, formed in 1930, was originally primarily intended to facilitate settling financial obligations arising from the peace treaties that concluded the First World War. During the Second World War, it helped the Germans transfer assets from occupied countries. Moreover, now that IMF was to be established, the BIS seemed to be superfluous. Commission III of the Bretton Woods Conference therefore considered Norway's proposal for \"liquidation of the Bank for International Settlements at the earliest possible moment.\" The proposal passed Commission III without objection and was adopted as part of the Final Act of the conference.\n\nMomentum for dissolving the BIS faded after U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt died in April 1945. Under his successor, Harry S. Truman, the top U.S. officials most critical of the BIS left office, and by 1948 the liquidation had been put aside.\n\nThe need for post-war Western economic order was resolved with the agreements made on monetary order and open system of trade at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference. These allowed for the synthesis of Britain's desire for full employment and economic stability and the United States' desire for free trade. The Bretton Woods system of pegged exchange rates lasted into the early 1970s.\n\nThe Bretton Woods Conference recommended that participating governments reach agreement to reduce obstacles to international trade. The recommendation was later embodied in the proposed International Trade Organization (ITO) to establish rules and regulations for international trade. The ITO would have complemented the IMF and IBRD. The ITO charter was agreed on at the U.N. Conference on Trade and Employment (held in Havana, Cuba, in March 1948), but the charter was not ratified by the U.S. Senate. As a result, the ITO never came into existence. The less ambitious General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was adopted in its place. However, in 1995, the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations established the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the replacement body for GATT. The GATT principles and agreements were adopted by the WTO, which was charged with administering and extending them.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes first proposed the ICU in 1941, as a way to regulate the balance of trade. His concern was that countries with a trade deficit would be unable to climb out of it, paying ever more interest to service their ever-greater debt, and therefore stifling global growth. The ICU would effectively be a bank with its own currency (the \"bancor\"), exchangeable with national currencies at a fixed rate. It would be the unit for accounting between nations, so their trade deficits or surpluses could be measured by it.\n\nOn top of that, each country would have an overdraft facility in its \"bancor\" account with the ICU. Keynes proposed having a maximum overdraft of half the average trade size over five years. If a country went over that, it would be charged interest, obliging a country to reduce its currency value and prevent capital exports. But countries with trade surpluses would also be charged interest at 10% if their surplus was more than \"half\" the size of their permitted overdraft, obliging them to increase their currency values and export more capital. If, at the year's end, their credit exceeded the maximum (half the size of the overdraft in surplus), the surplus would be confiscated.\n\nLionel Robbins reported that \"it would be difficult to exaggerate the electrifying effect on thought throughout the whole relevant apparatus of government ... nothing so imaginative and so ambitious had ever been discussed\". However, Harry Dexter White, representing the United States, which was the world's biggest creditor, said \"We have been perfectly adamant on that point. We have taken the position of absolutely no.\"\n\nInstead, White proposed an International Stabilization Fund, which would place the burden of maintaining the balance of trade on the deficit nations, and impose no limit on the surplus that rich countries could accumulate. White also proposed creation of the IBRD (now part of the World Bank) which would provide capital for economic reconstruction after the war. The IMF as agreed to at Bretton Woods was much closer to White's proposal than to Keynes's.\n\nThe Articles of Agreement for the IMF and IBRD signed at Bretton Woods did not come into force until ratified by countries with at least 80 percent of the capital subscriptions (\"quotas\"). The threshold was reached on December 27, 1945.\n\nThe institutions were formally organized at an inaugural meeting in Savannah, Georgia, on March 8–18, 1946. Notably absent from Savannah was the USSR, which had signed the Bretton Woods Final Act but had then decided not to ratify it. The USSR never joined the IMF and IBRD, though its successor the Russian Federation did in 1992. Australia and New Zealand were likewise absent from formal participation at Savannah (Australia sent observers), though they joined the IMF and IBRD later.\n\nBecause of its success in founding two international organizations that have had long and influential lives, the Bretton Woods Conference is sometimes cited as an example worthy of imitation. In particular, since the collapse in the early 1970s of the system of pegged exchange rates agreed to at Bretton Woods there have been a number of Calls for a \"New Bretton Woods\".\n\n\n"}

Although the author is mainly known as the Anonyomous of Elbasan (), according to Mahir Domi and Robert Elsie the linguistic and historical evidences indicate to be the work of Gregory of Durrës. The name of an unknown \"Papa Totasi\" (father Totasi) is written on the cover's verso with the same ink as the text. For this reason the work is sometimes attributed to Totasi as the owner, if not the creator of the manuscript.\n\nThe work is presumed to be the oldest work of Albanian Orthodox literature and the first Bible translation into Albanian. According to Elsie, the manuscript was created in 1761, soon before Gregory became the Metropolitan (archbishop) of the Archdiocese of Durrës (1762–1772). The archdiocese's see was then in the St. Jovan Vladimir's Church, in Shijon near Elbasan, central Albania. \n\nThe manuscript is composed of 30 unnumbered folios, 59 pages of biblic translations and has 10x7 cm format. The script used is the Elbasan script, which consists of forty letters, most of them completely original, and not derived from any language spoken in the regions neighboring Albania. However, according to Dhimitër Shuteriqi and Mahir Domi, there is some Slavic and Greek influence in the remainder of the letters. The Elbasan Gospel Manuscript is the only document where the Elbasan script has been retrieved so far.\n\nThe manuscript was purchased little before or around World War II by politician Lef Nosi, who was the owner of a remarkable personal library, and a notable collector. It was confiscated from him by the communist regime in 1945. It is now preserved in the National Archives of Albania. The albanologist and translator Injac Zamputi (1910–1998) transcribed the manuscript, after which the Elbasan Gospel was published in Standard Albanian for the first time. The origin was traced back to the village of Polis near Librazhd. Polisi back then was part of the wider Shpat region in today's Elbasan county, and its population had converted to Islam in early 19th century.\n\n"}

The remnants of Bronze Age civilizations such as the Hattian, Akkadian, Assyrian, and Hittite peoples provide us with many examples of the daily lives of its citizens and their trade. After the fall of the Hittites, the new states of Phrygia and Lydia stood strong on the western coast as Greek civilization began to flourish. They, and all the rest of Anatolia were relatively soon after incorporated into the Achaemenid Persian Empire.\n\nAs Persia grew in strength, their system of local government in Anatolia allowed many port cities to grow and to become wealthy. All of Anatolia got divided into various satrapies, ruled by satraps (governors) appointed by the central Persian rulers. The first state that was called Armenia by neighbouring peoples was the state of the Armenian Orontid dynasty, which included parts of eastern Turkey beginning in the 6th century BC, which became the Satrapy of Armenia under Achaemenid rule. Some of the satraps revolted periodically but did not pose a serious threat. In the 5th century BC, Darius I built the Royal Road, which linked the principal city of Susa with the west Anatolian city of Sardis. Anatolia played a pivotal role in Achaemenid history. In the earliest 5th century BC, some of the Ionian cities under Persian rule revolted, which culminated into the Ionian Revolt. This revolt, after being easily suppressed by the Persian authority, laid the direct uplead for the Greco-Persian Wars, which turned out to be one of the most crucial wars in European history. After Achaemenid Persian rule, the Greek Alexander the Great finally wrested control of the whole region from Persia in successive battles, proving victorious over the Persian Darius III. After Alexander's death, his conquests were split amongst several of his trusted generals, but were under constant threat of invasion from both the Gauls and other powerful rulers in Pergamon, Pontus, and Egypt. The Seleucid Empire, the largest of Alexander's territories, and which included Anatolia, became involved in a disastrous war with Rome culminating in the battles of Thermopylae and Magnesia. The resulting Treaty of Apamea in (188 BC) saw the Seleucids retreat from Anatolia. The Kingdom of Pergamum and the Republic of Rhodes, Rome's allies in the war, were granted the former Seleucid lands in Anatolia.\n\nRoman control of Anatolia was strengthened by a 'hands off' approach by Rome, allowing local control to govern effectively and providing military protection. In the early 4th century, Constantine the Great established a new administrative centre at Constantinople, and by the end of the 4th century the Roman empire split into two parts, the Eastern part (Romania) with Constantinople as its capital, referred to by historians as the Byzantine Empire from the original name, Byzantium.\n\nThe Thracians (, ) were a group of Indo-European tribes inhabiting a large area in Central and Southeastern Europe. They were bordered by the Scythians to the north, the Celts and the Illyrians to the west, the Ancient Greeks to the south and the Black Sea to the east. They spoke the Thracian language – a scarcely attested branch of the Indo-European language family. The study of Thracians and Thracian culture is known as Thracology.\n\nStarting around 1200 BC, the western coast of Anatolia was heavily settled by Aeolian and Ionian Greeks. Numerous important cities were founded by these colonists, such as Miletus, Ephesus, Smyrna and Byzantium, the latter founded by Greek colonists from Megara in 657 BC. All of Thrace, and the native Thracian peoples were conquered by Darius the Great in the late 6th century BC, and were re-subjugated into the empire in 492 BC following Mardonius' campaign during the First Persian invasion of Greece. The territory of Thrace later became unified by the Odrysian kingdom, founded by Teres I, probably after the Persian defeat in Greece.\n\nBy the 5th century BC, the Thracian presence was pervasive enough to have made Herodotus call them the second-most numerous people in the part of the world known by him (after the Indians), and potentially the most powerful, if not for their lack of unity. The Thracians in classical times were broken up into a large number of groups and tribes, though a number of powerful Thracian states were organized, such as the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace and the Dacian kingdom of Burebista. A type of soldier of this period called the Peltast probably originated in Thrace.\n\nBefore the expansion of the Kingdom of Macedon, Thrace was divided into three camps (East, Central, and West) after the withdrawal of the Persians following their eventual defeat in mainland Greece. A notable ruler of the East Thracians was Cersobleptes, who attempted to expand his authority over many of the Thracian tribes. He was eventually defeated by the Macedonians.\n\nThe Thracians were typically not city-builders, the largest Thracian cities were in fact large villages. and their only polis was Seuthopolis.\n\nThe Persian Achaemenid Empire fell to Alexander the Great in 334 BC, which led to increasing cultural homogeneity and Hellenization in the area. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, Anatolia was subsequently divided into a number of small Hellenistic kingdoms, all of which became part of the Roman Republic by the mid-1st century BC. The process of Hellenization that began with Alexander's conquest accelerated under Roman rule, and by the early centuries AD the local Anatolian languages and cultures had become extinct, being largely replaced by ancient Greek language and culture.\n\nIn 324, Constantine I chose Byzantium to be the new capital of the Roman Empire, renaming it New Rome. Following the death of Theodosius I in 395 and the permanent division of the Roman Empire between his two sons, the city, which would popularly come to be known as Constantinople became the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. This, which would later be branded by historians as the Byzantine Empire, ruled most of the territory of what is today Turkey until the Late Middle Ages, while the other remaining territory remained in Sassanid Persian hands.\n\nBetween the 3rd and 7th century AD, the Byzantines and the neighboring Sassanids frequently clashed over possession of Anatolia, which significantly exhausted both empires, thus laying the way open for the eventual Muslim conquests from both empires' respective south.\n\nHistorians generally agree that the first Turkic people lived in a region extending from Central Asia to Siberia. Historically they were established after the 6th century BCE. The earliest separate Turkic peoples appeared on the peripheries of the late Xiongnu confederation about 200 B.C (contemporaneous with the Chinese Han Dynasty). \nThe first mention of Turks was in a Chinese text that mentioned trade of Turk tribes with the Sogdians along the Silk Road.\n\nIt has often been suggested that the Xiongnu, mentioned in Han Dynasty records, were Proto-Turkic speakers.\n\nThe Hun hordes of Attila, who invaded and conquered much of Europe in the 5th century, may have been Turkic and descendants of the Xiongnu. Some scholars argue that the Huns were one of the earlier Turkic tribes, while others argue that they were of Mongolic origin.\n\nIn the 6th century, 400 years after the collapse of northern Xiongnu power in Inner Asia, leadership of the Turkic peoples was taken over by the Göktürks. Formerly in the Xiongnu nomadic confederation, the Göktürks inherited their traditions and administrative experience. From 552 to 745, Göktürk leadership united the nomadic Turkic tribes into the Göktürk Empire. The name derives from \"gok\", \"blue\" or \"celestial\". Unlike its Xiongnu predecessor, the Göktürk Khanate had its temporary \"khans\" from the Ashina clan that were \"subordinate\" to a sovereign authority controlled by a council of tribal chiefs. The Khanate retained elements of its original shamanistic religion, Tengriism, although it received missionaries of Buddhist monks and practiced a syncretic religion. The Göktürks were the first Turkic people to write Old Turkic in a runic script, the Orkhon script. The Khanate was also the first state known as \"Turk\". It eventually collapsed due to a series of dynastic conflicts, but the name \"Turk\" was later taken by many states and peoples. \n\nTurkic peoples and related groups migrated west from Turkestan and what is now Mongolia towards Eastern Europe, Iranian plateau and Anatolia and modern Turkey in many waves. The date of the initial expansion remains unknown. After many battles, they established their own state and later created the Ottoman Empire. The main migration occurred in medieval times, when they spread across most of Asia and into Europe and the Middle East. They also participated in the Crusades.\n\nThe Seljuq Turkmens created a medieval empire that controlled a vast area stretching from the Hindu Kush to eastern Anatolia and from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf. From their homelands near the Aral sea, the Seljuqs advanced first into Khorasan and then into mainland Persia before eventually conquering eastern Anatolia.\nThe Seljuq/Seljuk empire was founded by Tughril Beg (1016-1063) in 1037. Tughril was raised by his grandfather, Seljuk-Beg Seljuk gave his name to both the Seljuk empire and the Seljuk dynasty. The Seljuqs united the fractured political scene of the eastern Islamic world and played a key role in the first and second crusades. Highly Persianized in culture and language, the Seljuqs also played an important role in the development of the Turko-Persian tradition, even exporting Persian culture to Anatolia.\n\nThe Ottoman beylik's first capital was located in Bursa in 1326. Edirne which was conquered in 1361 was the next capital city. After largely expanding to Europe and Anatolia, in 1453, the Ottomans nearly completed the conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its capital, Constantinople during the reign of Mehmed II. Constantinople was made the capital city of the Empire following Edirne. The Ottoman Empire would continue to expand into the Eastern Anatolia, Central Europe, the Caucasus, North and East Africa, the islands in the Mediterranean, Greater Syria, Mesopotamia, and the Arabian peninsula in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent. The empire was often at odds with the Holy Roman Empire in its steady advance towards Central Europe through the Balkans and the southern part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In addition, the Ottomans were often at war with Persia over territorial disputes. At sea, the empire contended with the Holy Leagues, composed of Habsburg Spain, the Republic of Venice and the Knights of St. John, for control of the Mediterranean. In the Indian Ocean, the Ottoman navy frequently confronted Portuguese fleets in order to defend its traditional monopoly over the maritime trade routes between East Asia and Western Europe; these routes faced new competition with the Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488.\n\nThe Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 marked the beginning of Ottoman territorial retreat; some territories were lost by the treaty: Austria received all of Hungary and Transylvania except the Banat; Venice obtained most of Dalmatia along with the Morea (the Peloponnesus peninsula in southern Greece); Poland recovered Podolia. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Ottoman Empire continued losing its territories, including Greece, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and the Balkans in the 1912–1913 Balkan Wars. Anatolia remained multi-ethnic until the early 20th century (see Rise of Nationalism under the Ottoman Empire). Its inhabitants were of varied ethnicities, including Turks, Armenians, Assyrians, Kurds, Greeks, Frenchs, and Italians (particularly from Genoa and Venice). Faced with territorial losses on all sides the Ottoman Empire under the rule of the Three Pashas forged an alliance with Germany who supported it with troops and equipment. The Ottoman Empire entered World War I (1914–1918) on the side of the Central Powers and was ultimately defeated. During the war, major atrocities were committed such as Genocide, mass murder and death marches intentionally denying food and water to the deportees by the Ottoman government against the Armenians, Assyrians and Pontic Greeks causing millions of deaths and resulting in the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Following World War I, the huge conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new states.\n\nOn October 30, 1918, the Armistice of Mudros was signed, followed by the imposition of Treaty of Sèvres on August 10, 1920 by Allied Powers, which was never ratified. The Treaty of Sèvres would break up the Ottoman Empire and force large concessions on territories of the Empire in favour of Greece, Italy, Britain and France.\n\nThe occupation of some parts of the country by the Allies in the aftermath of World War I prompted the establishment of the Turkish national movement. Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, a military commander who had distinguished himself during the Battle of Gallipoli, the Turkish War of Independence was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres. By September 18, 1922, the occupying armies were expelled. On November 1, the newly founded parliament formally abolished the Sultanate, thus ending 623 years of Ottoman rule. The Treaty of Lausanne of July 24, 1923, led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed \"Republic of Turkey\" as the successor state of the Ottoman Empire, and the republic was officially proclaimed on October 29, 1923, in the new capital of Ankara. Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first President of Turkey and subsequently introduced many radical reforms with the aim of founding a new secular republic from the remnants of its Ottoman past. The Ottoman fez was abolished, full rights for women politically were established, and new writing system for Turkish based upon the Latin alphabet was created.\nAccording to the Law on Family Names, the Turkish parliament presented Mustafa Kemal with the honorific surname \"Atatürk\" (\"Father of the Turks\") in 1934.\nTurkey was neutral in World War II (1939–45) but signed a treaty with Britain in October 1939 that said Britain would defend Turkey if Germany attacked it. An invasion was threatened in 1941 but did not happen and Ankara refused German requests to allow troops to cross its borders into Syria or the USSR. Germany had been its largest trading partner before the war, and Turkey continued to do business with both sides. It purchased arms from both sides. The Allies tried to stop German purchases of chrome (used in making better steel). Starting in 1942 the Allies provided military aid. The Turkish leaders conferred with Roosevelt and Churchill at the Cairo Conference in November, 1943, and promised to enter the war. By August 1944, with Germany nearing defeat, Turkey broke off relations. In February 1945, it declared war on Germany and Japan, a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the nascent United Nations.\n\nMeanwhile, relations with Moscow worsened, setting stage for the start of the Cold War. The demands by the Soviet Union for military bases in the Turkish Straits, prompted the United States to declare the Truman Doctrine in 1947. The doctrine enunciated American intentions to guarantee the security of Turkey and Greece, and resulted in large-scale U.S. military and economic support.\n\nAfter participating with the United Nations forces in the Korean War, Turkey joined NATO in 1952, becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the Mediterranean. Following a decade of intercommunal violence on the island of Cyprus and the Greek military coup of July 1974, overthrowing President Makarios and installing Nikos Sampson as a dictator, Turkey invaded the Republic of Cyprus in 1974. Nine years later the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) was established. Turkey is the only country that recognises the TRNC\n\nThe single-party period was followed by multiparty democracy after 1945. The Turkish democracy was interrupted by military coups d'état in 1960, 1971 and 1980. In 1984, the PKK began an insurgency against the Turkish government; the conflict, which has claimed over 40,000 lives, continues today. Since the liberalization of the Turkish economy during the 1980s, the country has enjoyed stronger economic growth and greater political stability.\n\n\n"}

The first meeting was initiated by the French government, including official national representatives, leading scientists, and others. Subsequent meetings also included official representatives, leading scientists, and others. Primary aims were to develop reliable standards, both in relation to electrical units and electrical apparatus.\n\nIn 1881, both within and across countries, different electrical units were being used. There were at least 12 different units of electromotive force, 10 different units\nof electric current and 15 different units of resistance. \n\nOther international Congresses were held, and sometimes referred to as International Electrical Congress, Electrical Conference, and similar variations. Secondary sources make different judgments about how to classify the Congresses. In this article, the Congresses with representatives from national governments are identified as \"International Electrical Congress\". Other Congresses — often addressing the same issues — are identified here as \"Concurrent Related International Electrical Congresses\". Some of these related conferences were devoted to preparing for an International Electrical Congress.\n\nIn 1906 the International Electrotechnical Commission was created. Congresses were organised under its auspices were also sometimes referred to as \"International Electrical Congress\". In this article, Congresses organized by the Commission are listed under \"International Electrotechnical Congresses\", while other related Congresses are listed under \"Related International Electrotechnical Conferences\".\n\nHeld from 15 September-5 October 1881, in connection with the International Exposition of Electricity. Adolphe Cochery, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs of the French\nGovernment, was the Chairman. At the Congress, William Thomson (United Kingdom), Hermann von Helmholtz (Germany), and (Italy) were elected as foreign vice-presidents.\nAbout 200-250 persons participated, and a proceedings was published in 1882. Notable participants included: Helmholtz, Clausius, Kirchoff, Werner Siemens, Ernst Mach, Rayleigh, and Lenz, among others.\n\nThe three main topics for the Congress were: electrical units, improvements in international telegraphy, and various applications of\nelectricity. The Congress resolved to endorse the 1873 British Association for the Advancement of Science proposal for defining the ohm and the volt as practical units, and also made resolutions to define ampere, coulomb and farad, as units for current, quantity, and capacity respectively, to complete the practical system. It also resolved that an international committee should conduct new tests to determine the length of the column of mercury for measuring the ohm.\n\nHeld from 21 - 25 August, in connection with the World's Columbian Exposition, with almost 500 participants. Elisha Gray was the Congress president. A proceedings was published. \n\nHeld in 18-25 August in connection with the Paris Exposition Universelle. Éleuthère Mascart was the Congress President. There were more than 900 participants, about half of which were from France, and about 120 technical papers presented. A two-volume proceedings was published in 1901 \n\nHeld from 12-17 September 1904, in connection with the Louisiana Purchase Exposition\n\nDuring the period that the Electrical Congresses were held, other conferences and international Congresses were held, sometimes in preparation to the official Electrical Congresses. These events are listed here.\n\n\"Conférence international pour la détermination des unités électriques\" (International Conference for Determination of Electrical Units)\n\nHeld 16-26 October. Was motivated by a resolution from the 1881 International Electrical Congress. A verbal transcript of the conference was published.\n\n\"International Conference for Determination of Electrical Units\"\n\n\"International Congress of Electricians\" \nHeld 24-31 August, in connection with Exposition universelle de 1889. About 530 participants from at least 11 countries.\n\nHeld 7-12 September, in connection with the International Electrotechnical Exhibition (Die Internationale Elektrotechnische Ausstellung 1891), organized by Elektrotechnische Gesellschaft. Galileo Ferraris was a vice-president at the conference. There were 715 participants (473 from Germany and 243 from other countries, including Austria, United Kingdom, USA, and France). An official report of the conference was published.\n\nHeld in connection with the British Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting\n\nHeld 4-9 August, in connection with the . Insufficient and late communication about the organization of the Congress hampered widespread participation, so that the conference had about 200 participants, mostly from Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Belgium.\n\n\"International Conference on Electric Units and Standards\". Held in October. Organized by the Commission on Electric Units and Standards of the International Electrotechnical Commission\n\nHeld 10-17 September, organized by and the Italian Electrotechnical Committee of the International Electrotechnical Commission\n\nWas to be held 13-18 September, and organized by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, but was cancelled because of the outbreak of World War I.\n\n\"Internationale Konferenz über Elektrische Masseinheiten\" (International Conference on Electrical Units)\n\nHeld 23-25 October at Physikalisch-Technischen Reichsanstalt at Charlottenburg. The 1904 Congress recommended holding an international conference to address discrepancies in the electrical units and their interpretation. Emil Warburg, president of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Germany, invited representatives from corresponding national laboratories in the United States (National Bureau of Standards), the United Kingdom (National Physical Laboratory), and the official standards commissions in Austria and Belgium to an informal conference on electrical standards and units. Additionally Mascart (France), Rayleigh (United Kingdom) and Carhart (USA) were invited because of their expertise and influence. Thirteen of the fifteen invited persons participated in the conference, six from the Reichsanstalt, two from the Belgian Commission on Electrical Units, two from the Austrian Commission on Standardization, Richard Glazebrook from the National Physical Laboratory, Mascart, and Carhart. The non-attendees were Samuel Wesley Stratton, director of the National Bureau of Standard, who sent three papers outlining the positions and proposals of the Bureau, and Rayleigh. A proceedings was published.\n\nHeld 14-19 September, in connection with the L'exposition internationale des applications de l'électricité. A three-volume proceedings was published.\n"}

Conflicting explanations were given about the event and the publication of the picture, which seemed to have political motivations.\nIn December 2010 Femi Shodunke, the deputy editor of the Nigerian Compass, was waylaid by four gunmen in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. He narrowly escaped with his life.\n\nIn February 2011 Chief Akintola Adeniyi (SAN), an Ibadan-based lawyer, launched a N50 billion libel suit against several individuals as well as the \"Nigerian Compass\" and the paper's Daily Editor, Mr Gabriel Akinadewo. The suit said the newspaper had reproduced libelous remarks made by the main target of the suit, Otunba Sunday Ojo Williams.\nAfter TheNews published a highly critical story on Daniel's eight-year governorship, Daniel responded angrily. He accused the weekly news magazine of having collaborated with Bola Ahmed Tinubu on the story. In their riposte on 17 March 2011, TheNews asserted the independence of their newspaper, saying \"... we can only be bemused by the unfounded claims that our stories are being teleguided externally. The governor apparently does that with his Nigerian Compass. We concede that right to him\".\n\nIn January 2014, the Nigerian Compass announced the acquisition of its publication right by Segun Oyebolu who had earlier made an offer of N1 Billion to Mr Daniel in 2012.

{"id": "52922001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52922001", "title": "Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum", "text": "Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum\n\nThe Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum was founded in 2004 as a forum for the regional parliaments of Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern), West Pomerania (Westpommern), Pomerania (Pommern), Warmia-Masuria (Ermland-Masuren) and the administrative district of Kaliningrad. The regional parliament of the southern Swedish province Schonen is an associated Member.\n\nThe already existing bilateral relations between the regional parliaments of Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and the regional parliaments of Pomerania and West Pomerania were the starting point of the Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum.\n\nThe decision to form a parliamentary partnership was already taken in 2001 by the regional parliament of Schleswig-Holstein and the regional parliament of Pomerania. The parliaments made a commitment to cooperate especially in terms of European-, Baltic-, minority- and regional politics. In 2004 those two institutions decided to build a parliamentary partnership with the goal to form a network of parliamentary relations along the coast of the southern baltic sea.\n\nThe regional parliament of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania already had intensive relations with the regional parliaments of Pomerania and West Pomerania before the parliamentary forum was founded.\n\nIn 1996, a meeting of parliamentarians took place in Krugsdorf (Germany). Representatives of the regional parliament of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the European Parliament, the association of the local community Pomerania, the Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Association of Counties, the regional parliament of the voivodship of Stettin and representatives of the local association of the communities in Western Pomerania took part in this conference. In the years from 1997-2004 meetings of representatives of parliamentary expert groups took place for a bilateral exchange of information. The main subjects of discussion were economy, tourism and the handling of the custom stations. In 2001, a partnership agreement was signed by the regional parliament of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and the regional parliament of Western Pomerania. In 2004, the declaration of the regional parliaments of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and of Pomerania followed.\n\nIn 2004, Poland joined the EU. This led to an intensification of parliamentary relations. The central subject was the European funding policy but also the perspectives of young people in this region that now was free of a constructed border.\n\nThis development was also a topic of the conference about „The perspectives of border crossing cooperation in the southern Baltic after the eastward expansion of the EU“ which took place in October 2003 in Schwerin. Representatives of the regional parliaments of Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, West Pomerania and Pomerania participated in the conference. In the course of the following conference from 25–27 April 2004 in Gdansk, the “Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum” was founded. The forum had the goal to connect and coordinate the bilateral relations that already existed between the four regional parliaments. \nThe good bilateral relations between Germany and Poland were the basis for the “Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum“ that was founded in 2004. From that point onwards, the parliamentary cooperation was taken to a multilateral level.\n\nSubsequently, the regional parliaments of Warmia-Masuria and of the “Oblast of Kaliningrad“ joined the Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum in 2008 as well as the free Hanseatic City of Hamburg in 2009. The southern Swedish region “Schonen“ joined the forum as an associated partner in 2005.\n\nThe Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum regularly deals with subjects that specifically affect the region. The regional parliaments have frequently addressed demands about certain issues of economy and structural politics, as well as the topics energy supply, scientific research, tourism and culture to the relevant actors in the southern Baltic region.\n\nDuring the 4th Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum from 21-23 Mai 2006 in Kiel, an EU strategy for the Baltic sea region was discussed with view to the Green book of the European Commission for a future EU maritime strategy. So the gathering was meant to create a European agenda for the future sea politics of the EU in the southern Baltic. The forum considered an integrated, interdisciplinary and holistic EU maritime policy, which considers the opposing ecological and economic interests in the southern Baltic region, as necessary. \nThe increasing integration of European policies has increasingly influenced the work of the parliamentary forum. In 2007, the European Commission created an action plan for an integrated maritime policy. Subsequently, the parliamentary forum dealt on a regular basis with the measures announced in the action plan, e.g. the support of intersectionary clusters or the competitiveness of maritime transport. So the main topic of the 7th parliamentary forum which took place in Schwerin was “The implementation of European strategies in the southern Baltic”. From then onwards, the parliamentary forum had significantly supported the development of the EU strategy for the Baltic sea region and made comprehensive contributions in the consultation process. Additionally, it was decided to evaluate the policies resulting from the EU strategy on a yearly basis. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is particularly active as the coordinator for the tourism policies. The main topic of the 9th Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum in Gdansk was the EU strategy for the Baltic sea region. The 13th parliamentary forum took place from 20–21 April 2015 in Hamburg. It mainly dealt with “Science and university cooperation in the Baltic sea area”. The 14th parliamentary forum with the topic “Agriculture, fishery and food industry – Innovation and cooperation in the southern Baltic region” took place from 12–14 June 2016 in Kiel.\n\nThe delegates of the participating regional parliaments, the associated partners and representatives from politics, science and economy come together yearly in the Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum to discuss the subjects that effect the region and to elaborate on recommendations in these matters. The nominated experts give the parliamentarians scientific support with view to the forum´s topics. These topics are the foundation for the resolutions in which the delegates express demands to the relevant actors in the southern Baltic region. Following the annual conference, the regional parliament of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has implemented the resolutions regularly with a parliamentary resolution on the basis of a joint proposal of the democratic parliamentary groups.\n\nThe actual members of the Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum are the regional parliaments of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, West Pomerania, Pomerania and Warmia-Masuria as well as the administrative district of Kaliningrad. The southern Swedish province of Schonen is an associated Partner.\n\nThe delegates regularly establish working groups to prepare the annual conferences and to elaborate on the actual issues with experts.\n\nWorking groups were established in the past to deal inter alia with the topics “Integrated EU maritime policies”, “Baltic sea strategies” and “Energy supply”. The region Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania presided in the working group “Energy supply” which was established at the 5th Parliamentary forum in 2007. The expert committees of the regional parliaments participating in the forum came together in Schwerin and Stettin to work on recommendations concerning the energy policies of the members of the forum together with international experts.\n\nA unique aspect of the Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum is the participation of young people in the conferences. Just like the parliamentarians the young people discuss subjects affecting the region and make recommendations to the delegates. At the 3rd forum that took place from 18–20 September 2005 in Binz, the transnational youth project “youth, region and parliament” was initiated. This project gives young people the opportunity to intern in the office of a parliamentarian. This way, young people get an idea of how parliaments in the different regions and countries work and get to know the other country.\n\n\n"}
