Spiritual, moral, social and philosophical views are reflected throughout these tales.\n\nThe tales hand down ancient national traditions and customs whilst depicting the natural beauty of Azerbaijan; its green valleys and pastures, magnificent mountains, purling rivers and blossoming gardens.\n\nThe first recorded fairy tales are found in the heroic Oghuz Kitabi Dede Korkut (\"The book of grandfather Korkut\") of the 10th-11th centuries. For instance, there is a narrated tale about a monster-man who eats \"two people and five thousand sheep\" per day in Tepegoz's (a translation from Turkish – Cyclop) story.\n\nJirtdan is the most popular fairy tale character among the children's tales in Azerbaijan, meaning \"small\" when translated from Azerbaijani. Many fairy tales are based on this character, who is distinguished for his keenness of wit, courage and bravery. He can simultaneously be an idler, but also very brave. Div (giant) is another popular character. Little Jirtdan acquires courage and bravery when he meets Div.\n\nAzerbaijani fairy tales are divided into three types in essence and content: fairy tales about animals, fairy tales about common people and magic fairy tales.\n\nThe second edition of \"National fairy-tales from Azerbaijan\" was published by Verlag Dr.Koster Publishing House (Berlin) on the initiative of the Azerbaijani embassy in Germany. Liliane Grimm is an Austrian researcher of Azerbaijani studies and author and translator of the book, whose first acquaintance with Azerbaijan was held at an exhibition of Azerbaijani artists in Vienna.

The station also broadcasts a Punjabi language format on a Subsidiary Communications Multiplex Operation frequency.\n\nThe station launched in 1978 playing \"oldies\" from offices and studios just north of Edmonton in St. Albert. The original frequency was 1070 kHz (AM) with the callsign CKST.\n\nIn 1988, CKST received approval to move from 1070 to 1200 AM and changed callsigns to CHMG the same year. CHMG received approval move from AM to FM in 1994.\n\nIn 1995, CHMG changed to its current callsign, CFMG. At the same time, the station shifted to an adult contemporary format, branded as \"EZ Rock\". Programmed by longtime broadcaster Tammy Cole, EZ Rock was a station designed to appeal to office work environments. Music was slanted towards female listeners 25–54 years old.\n\nOn September 28, 2007, the CRTC approved the sale of CFMG and all Standard Radio assets to Astral Media.\nAstral changed the logo of the station in September 2010; however, the adult contemporary format is unchanged while continuing to say the decimal point on the station ID. In addition, most of the classic hits were dropped.\n\nOn February 4, 2011, the station dropped adult contemporary and became contemporary hit radio as \"104.9 Virgin Radio\". EZ Rock's last song was \"The Boys Of Summer\" by Don Henley, while the first song on \"Virgin\" was \"Firework\" by Katy Perry. This left Edmonton with no adult contemporary station for 51 days, similar to markets where an adult contemporary station would play Christmas music from November/December, until CKEA-FM dropped adult album alternative for adult contemporary (which has since shifted to adult hits).\n\nCFMG, during its final adult contemporary week, did list its contemporary hit radio adds on Mediabase's Canadian adult contemporary panel. A week after the station flipped formats, the station was delisted from Mediabase's station adds. As of March 2011, CFMG-FM joined CHBN-FM on the Mediabase contemporary hit radio panel.\n\nCFMG is the third Virgin Radio station in Canada to have a mainstream top 40 format, the first being at Calgary's CIBK-FM the year before, and in Toronto at CKFM-FM in 2009.\n\nEvery year for one week, along with sister stations CFBR-FM and CFRN, CFMG-FM presents, Stollery Week, a week long fundraiser for the Stollery Children's Hospital. In past years all three stations had broadcast live for 2 days from the Stollery Children's Hospital. In year one, $300,000 was raised for the Pediatric Oncology Unit; in year two, EZ Rock and her sister stations raised $500,000 for Research. The station was also known for the \"EZ Rock Christmas Party for Single Parent Families\" where families in need are treated to a very special Christmas.\n\nThe last ratings period when CFMG was an adult contemporary station (October/10 - January/11) placed the station at #4 with a 7.4 share. In the first ratings period as Virgin Radio (February/11 - May/11), the station plummeted to #14 and with a 2.6 share.

The others are Argonnessen (to the south east), Xen'drik (to the south west) and Sarlona (in the far east). The island continent of Aerenal lies just south east of Khorvaire, and to the north lies the frozen and barren continent of Frostfell.\n\nThe landmass features a number of countries:\n\nAundair is a mostly flat country of farmlands and vineyards, with a strong culture of craftsmen, academics, and magic. Its capital is Fairhaven, and House Lyrandar and House Orien are headquartered here. It possesses the premier academy of magic in all of Khorvaire, the Floating Towers of Arcanix. Although Aundair's army is small compared to its neighbors, it held its own throughout the Last War through its use of spellcasters within the army to employ destructive magical weapons and spells against its enemies. Aundair is governed by The Triumvirate, consisting of Queen Aurala, First Warlord Adal (who is the Royal Minister of Magic), and Lord Darro (leader of the Knights Arcane). Queen Aurala is a suspicious ruler, and as such operates the most extensive espionage system employed by any of the governments of Khorvaire, the Royal Eyes of Aundair. Its fiercest enemy during the Last War was neighboring Thrane, and relations between the two remain cold. Aundair's national symbol is the dragonhawk, a large, majestic bird of prey that can be used as a mount.\n\nBreland is a large and powerful country that prides itself for its free speech, diversity, and acceptance as compared to the rest of Khorvaire. Although executive and judicial powers still lie with King Boranel, an elected parliament oversees the legislative duties of the country, making Breland the most democratic of any of the Five Nations. The capital of Breland is Wroat, and Breland is home to the largest city on Khorvaire, Sharn, known as the City of Towers for its towering buildings and cosmopolitan atmosphere. Breland has emerged from the Last War as the most powerful country culturally and economically, while its military power rivals that of Karrnath. Although it is the most powerful of the Five Nations emerging from the Last War, it is also the most interested in maintaining peace; King Boranel orchestrated the Treaty of Thronehold, which ended the Last War. The country produces a wide array of goods, and is especially noted for the weapons produced in the smelters and forges of Sharn. House Medani and one of the three branches of House Cannith maintain their headquarters within Sharn, while House Phiarlan operates from Wroat. After Cyre was destroyed, the surviving Cyran refugees were accepted into the country and formed a community known as New Cyre. The other nations hope for the collapse of the government after King Boranel's death, as none of his heirs have expressed near the amount of charisma or leadership skills as Boranel. Other groups within the country have clamored for the complete elimination of the monarchy and the establishment of an entirely elected government. As the largest and most populous nation (3.7 million people), it is home to the largest communities of humans (44% of Breland's populace), gnomes (14%), half-elves (10%), elves (8%) and changelings (4%).\n\nHome of nearly 69% of Khorvaire's goblins, Darguun is perceived by civilised people as a necessary evil, for the moment at least. It has hardly any exports, although it has a deal with House Deneith to supply mercenaries.\n\nDarguun was once land owned by the nation of Cyre, and was appropriated by goblinoid mercenaries, who served during the Last War, during a mass coup that occurred around 29 years ago. The coup involved the uniting of numerous goblin bands, scattered throughout the armies of all five warring nations in a massed assault and conquest of southern Cyre. \n\nThis event was largely orchestrated by a young hobgoblin, named Haruuc, who has since named himself Lhesh Haruuc Shaarat'kor, or the High Warlord Haruuc of the Scarlet Blade. It is he to whom the Ghaal'dar tribe owe allegiance, and his rule has been marked by both cunning and tact, as he his capacity for diplomacy aided the recognition of Darguun as an individual entity at the Treaty of Thronehold (which ended the Last War 2 years ago in YK 996).\n\nThe Ghaal'dar, as a whole, have the most developed relations with foreign realms, trading goods and the services of well-trained goblinoid mercenaries with Breland and Thrane. The survivors of Cyre have little regard for the goblins, given their occupation of Cyre land and general bitterness at the loss of their own home. Two other goblin clans exist (consisting of numerous tribes each) - the Dhakaani clans (Kech Volaar and Kech Shaarat), which reside in the western Seawall Mountains within ancient Dhakaani fortresses, and the Marguls, which are tribes of the Northern Seawalls (mostly their highlands) and are primarily composed of bugbears.\n\nThe Marguls are fearsome and the most barbaric of the clans, sharing few interactions with the outside world and only passing relations with Lhesh Haruuc and the Ghall'dar. The Kech seek the rebuilding of the ancient Dhakaani empire, and are guardians of lore and techniques of the fallen kingdom, often seeking out ancient artifacts and stories of the past.\n\nThe Demon Wastes are a barren, volcanic wasteland stretching out from beyond the Shadowcrags and the Icehorn Mountains, which separate the area from the Eldeen Reaches. The plateau that stretches out from the mountains is punctuated by a series of canyons and mesas that form a natural labyrinth from which the demons possess their easiest access to the surface world in all of Khorvaire. From here, the Lords of Dust, ruled by malevolent Rakshasa, control fiends and demons and orchestrate far-reaching schemes across Eberron to see their race one day return to power. Two groups of humanoids wander the wastes. One, the Carrion Tribes, are the bloodthirsty, primitive, demon-worshiping Human tribes that wander the plains beyond the Labyrinth. Meanwhile, four separate tribes of slightly more sophisticated orcs (sprinkled with a handful of humans and half-orcs), known as the Ghaash'kala, believe that it is their sacred right to keep demons, barbarian tribes, and other monstrosities from finding their way onto the rest of the continent, and also attempt to keep people from entering the region.\n\nBefore the Last War, Droaam was a part of Breland, but it proved too difficult to protect all civilised inhabitants while fighting a war. Now it is inhabited by mostly goblins, ogres, hags and gnolls.\n\nMost of the land is taken up by forest, out of which most druids operate. The country was a part of Aundair before the Last War, but when troops were withdrawn out of the Eldeen Reaches to help protect the main cities of Aundair, the inhabitants of the Eldeen Reaches claimed independence. House Vadalis operates from the nation.\n\nThe dictatorship of Karrnath has good ties with the Mror Holds. House Jorasco and House Deneith operate out of Karrnath. Notably, Karrnath supplemented its fighting force with undead creatures.\n\nPirates and other nautical forces live here. The principalities consist of a number of islands. Anyone with power controls not only a flagship, but also some land.\n\nCyre was a strategic battleground in the Last War, and was host to some of the largest battles of that war. In the last years of the Last War, Cyre was suddenly, and inexplicably, destroyed. A not-quite-dead wasteland remains where Cyre lay, surrounded by a thick gray fog. It appears that Mournland is literally an open grave, where the bodies of deceased soldiers refuse to decay.\nA few survivors from Cyre have settled a village in Breland, dubbed \"New Cyre\". The village has expanded to a population size of about 5000.\n\nThis dwarven nation is an important economic power in Khorvaire. House Kundarak operates a powerful banking emporium from here. The dwarves have built impenetrable forts here.\n\nA country of colonists and idealists, Q'barra is a rainforest. The country was founded, far from everything, to maintain the ideals of King Galifar I, and consists of a few cities and small villages spread throughout the jungle. Q'barra mines and exports Eberron Dragonshards. No House operates out of Q'barra, although House Tharashk's Finders Guild is involved in the search for Dragonshards. Conflicts have arisen between the lizardfolk who are native to the region and the new Human settlers.\n\nThe Shadow Marches are home to most half-orcs. The country is home to mostly orcs and human families, with a few half-orcs. The families are part of clans, made up of both humans and orcs. House Tharashk operates from here, and consists of a fairly loose group of humans and half-orcs. Eberron Dragonshards are found in the Shadow Marches.\n\nHalflings, who learned to work together during the Last War, live a mostly nomadic lifestyle here. They are hunters and herders, and have little industry. House Ghallanda operated out of the Talenta Plains.\n\nFormally, Thrane is a monarchy ruled by Queen Diani ir'Wynarn, descendant of King Galifar I. In reality, however, the royal family serves only as a figurehead. Thrane is a fundamentalist theocracy and the real power resides with the Church of the Silver Flame. Below the mighty Council of Cardinals, the archbishops of the Silver Flame act as governors and mayors throughout the realm. Religious design and artwork dominate most of the architecture, giving the urban areas a unique look that doesn't exist anywhere else in Khorvaire. There are few people in Thrane who follow any other faith than the Silver Flame, but those who do and do it openly can expect to be met with suspicion and hostility.\n\nOriginally a colony of elves from the island continent of Aerenal. The elves that live here live a very militaristic lifestyle and regularly raid Q'barra. Humans, mostly farmers, live here too and produce food for the elves in a sort of symbiosis. House Lyrandar is one the few Houses with any sort of influence here, as it can control the weather.\n\nThe gnomes have lived here for thousands of years, managing to keep their independence through diplomacy. When King Galifar I built his kingdom, the gnomes surrendered, to maintain their independence. They export diplomatic expertise and produce the Korranberg Chronicle, a widely read newspaper. House Kundarak and House Sivis operate out of Zilargo.\n\nAccording to the \"Eberron Campaign Setting\", Khorvaire is home to 15,520,020 people, although some fans dispute the realism of that number, arguing that ten times that is more realistic. The bulk of the population, 43.2%, is human. The second largest population is of dwarves, which make up another 9.3%.\n"}

Though not part of Roman Catholic dogma, many Christians, including members of the clergy, have held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing Jesus, through the so-called blood curse of Pontius Pilate in the Gospels, among other things.\n\nAs stated in the Boston College Guide to Passion Plays, \"Over the course of time, Christians began to accept... that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus’ death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of deicide, or God-killing. For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide (Which was originally attributed by Melito of Sardis) has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in Europe and America.\"\n\nThis accusation was repudiated in 1964, when the Catholic Church under Pope Paul VI issued the document \"Nostra aetate\" as a part of Vatican II.\n\nAmong socio-economic factors were restrictions by the authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to the Jews, pushing them into marginal occupations considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and moneylending, tolerated them as a \"necessary evil\". Catholic doctrine of the time held that lending money for interest was a sin, and forbidden to Christians. Not being subject to this restriction, Jews dominated this business. The Torah and later sections of the Hebrew Bible criticise usury but interpretations of the Biblical prohibition vary (the only time Jesus used violence was against money changers taking a toll to enter temple). Since few other occupations were open to them, Jews were motivated to take up money lending. This was said to show Jews were insolent, greedy, usurers, and subsequently led to many negative stereotypes and propaganda. Natural tensions between creditors (typically Jews) and debtors (typically Christians) were added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Peasants who were forced to pay their taxes to Jews could personify them as the people taking their earnings while remaining loyal to the lords on whose behalf the Jews worked.\n\nAs the Black Death epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than a half of the population, Jews were taken as scapegoats. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence, in particular in the Iberian peninsula and in the Germanic Empire. In Provence, 40 Jews were burnt in Toulon as soon as April 1348. \"Never mind that Jews were not immune from the ravages of the plague ; they were tortured until they confessed to crimes that they could not possibly have committed. In one such case, a man named Agimet was ... coerced to say that Rabbi Peyret of Chambéry (near Geneva) had ordered him to poison the wells in Venice, Toulouse, and elsewhere. In the aftermath of Agimet's \"confession\", the Jews of Strasbourg were burned alive on February 14, 1349.\n\nAlthough the Pope Clement VI tried to protect them by the July 6, 1348 papal bull and another 1348 bull, several months later, 900 Jews were burnt in Strasbourg, where the plague hadn't yet affected the city. Clement VI condemned the violence and said those who blamed the plague on the Jews (among whom were the flagellants) had been \"seduced by that liar, the Devil.\"\n\nFrom around the 12th century through the 19th there were Christians who believed that some (or all) Jews possessed magical powers; some believed that they had gained these magical powers from making a deal with the devil. See also Judensau, Judeophobia.\n\nOn many occasions, Jews were accused of a blood libel, the supposed drinking of blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian Eucharist. According to the authors of these blood libels, the 'procedure' for the alleged sacrifice was something like this: a child who had not yet reached puberty was kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. The child would be tortured by Jews, and a crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try the child. The child would be presented to the tribunal naked and tied and eventually be condemned to death. In the end, the child would be crowned with thorns and tied or nailed to a wooden cross. The cross would be raised, and the blood dripping from the child's wounds would be caught in bowls or glasses and then drunk. Finally, the child would be killed with a thrust through the heart from a spear, sword, or dagger. Its dead body would be removed from the cross and concealed or disposed of, but in some instances rituals of black magic would be performed on it. \n\nThe story of William of Norwich (d. 1144) is often cited as the first known accusation of ritual murder against Jews. The Jews of Norwich, England were accused of murder after a Christian boy, William, was found dead. It was claimed that the Jews had tortured and crucified their victim. The legend of William of Norwich became a cult, and the child acquired the status of a holy martyr. Recent analysis has cast doubt on whether this was the first of the series of blood libel accusations but not on the contrived and antisemitic nature of the tale.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages blood libels were directed against Jews in many parts of Europe. The believers of these accusations reasoned that the Jews, having crucified Jesus, continued to thirst for pure and innocent blood and satisfied their thirst at the expense of innocent Christian children. Following this logic, such charges were typically made in Spring around the time of Passover, which approximately coincides with the time of Jesus' death.\n\nThe story of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln (d. 1255) said that after the boy was dead, his body was removed from the cross and laid on a table. His belly was cut open and his entrails were removed for some occult purpose, such as a divination ritual. The story of Simon of Trent (d. 1475) emphasized how the boy was held over a large bowl so all his blood could be collected.\n\nJews were sometimes falsely accused of desecrating consecrated hosts in a reenactment of the Crucifixion; this crime was known as host desecration and carried the death penalty.\n\nJews were subject to a wide range of legal disabilities and restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century. Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations varying with place and time, and determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often Jews were barred from all occupations but money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden. The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in ghettos, and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own, were forced to swear special Jewish Oaths, and suffered a variety of other measures, including restrictions on dress.\n\nThe Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 was the first to proclaim the requirement for Jews to wear something that distinguished them as Jews. It could be a coloured piece of cloth in the shape of a star or circle or square, a Jewish hat (already a distinctive style), or a robe. In many localities, members of medieval society wore badges to distinguish their social status. Some badges (such as guild members) were prestigious, while others ostracised outcasts such as lepers, reformed heretics and prostitutes. The local introduction and enforcement of these rules varied greatly. Jews sought to evade the badges by paying what amounted to bribes in the form of temporary \"exemptions\" to kings, which were revoked and re-paid whenever the king needed to raise funds.\n\nThe mobs accompanying the First Crusade, and particularly the People's Crusade of 1096, attacked the Jewish communities in Germany, France, and England, and put many Jews to death. Entire communities, like those of Treves, Speyer, Worms, Mainz, and Cologne, were slain during the first Crusade by a mob army. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the Rhenish cities alone between May and July 1096. Before the Crusades the Jews had practically a monopoly of trade in Eastern products, but the closer connection between Europe and the East brought about by the Crusades raised up a class of merchant traders among the Christians, and from this time onward restrictions on the sale of goods by Jews became frequent. The religious zeal fomented by the Crusades at times burned as fiercely against the Jews as against the Muslims, though attempts were made by bishops during the First crusade and the papacy during the Second Crusade to stop Jews from being attacked. Both economically and socially the Crusades were disastrous for European Jews. They prepared the way for the anti-Jewish legislation of Pope Innocent III, and formed the turning point in the medieval history of the Jews.\n\nIn the County of Toulouse (now part of southern France) Jews were received on good terms until the Albigensian Crusade. Toleration and favour shown to the Jews was one of the main complaints of the Roman Church against the Counts of Toulouse. Following the Crusaders' successful wars against Raymond VI and Raymond VII, the Counts were required to discriminate against Jews like other Christian rulers. In 1209, stripped to the waist and barefoot, Raymond VI was obliged to swear that he would no longer allow Jews to hold public office. In 1229 his son Raymond VII, underwent a similar ceremony where he was obliged to prohibit the public employment of Jews, this time at Notre Dame in Paris. Explicit provisions on the subject were included in the Treaty of Meaux (1229). By the next generation a new, zealously Catholic, ruler was arresting and imprisoning Jews for no crime, raiding their houses, seizing their cash, and removing their religious books. They were then released only if they paid a new \"tax\". A historian has argued that organised and official persecution of the Jews became a normal feature of life in southern France only after the Albigensian Crusade because it was only then that the Church became powerful enough to insist that measures of discrimination be applied.\n\n\"Only a few expulsions of the Jews are described in this section, for a more extended list see History of anti-Semitism, and also the History of the Jews in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Portugal.\"\n\nIn the Middle Ages in Europe persecutions and formal expulsions of Jews were liable to occur at intervals, although it should be said that this was also the case for other minority communities, whether religious or ethnic. There were particular outbursts of riotous persecution in the Rhineland massacres of 1096 in Germany accompanying the lead-up to the First Crusade, many involving the crusaders as they travelled to the East. There were many local expulsions from cities by local rulers and city councils. In Germany the Holy Roman Emperor generally tried to restrain persecution, if only for economic reasons, but he was often unable to exert much influence. As late as 1519, the Imperial city of Regensburg took advantage of the recent death of Emperor Maximilian I to expel its 500 Jews.\n\nThe practice of expelling the Jews accompanied by confiscation of their property, followed by temporary readmissions for ransom, was utilized to enrich the French crown during 12th-14th centuries. The most notable such expulsions were: from Paris by Philip Augustus in 1182, from the entirety of France by Louis IX in 1254, by Charles IV in 1306, by Charles V in 1322, by Charles VI in 1394.\n\nTo finance his war to conquer Wales, Edward I of England taxed the Jewish moneylenders. When the Jews could no longer pay, they were accused of disloyalty. Already restricted to a limited number of occupations, the Jews saw Edward abolish their \"privilege\" to lend money, choke their movements and activities and were forced to wear a yellow patch. The heads of Jewish households were then arrested, over 300 of them taken to the Tower of London and executed, while others killed in their homes. \"See also:-Massacres at London and York (1189–1190).\" The complete banishment of all Jews from the country in 1290 led to thousands killed and drowned while fleeing and the absence of Jews from England for three and a half centuries, until 1655, when Oliver Cromwell reversed the policy.\n\nIn 1492, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile issued \"General Edict on the Expulsion of the Jews\" from Spain (\"see also Spanish Inquisition\") and many Sephardi Jews fled to the Ottoman Empire, some to Palestine.\n\nThe Kingdom of Portugal followed suit and in December 1496, it was decreed that any Jew who did not convert to Christianity would be expelled from the country. However, those expelled could only leave the country in ships specified by the King. When those who chose expulsion arrived at the port in Lisbon, they were met by clerics and soldiers who used force, coercion, and promises in order to baptize them and prevent them from leaving the country. This period of time technically ended the presence of Jews in Portugal. Afterwards, all converted Jews and their descendants would be referred to as \"New Christians\" or Marranos (lit. \"pigs\" in Spanish), and they were given a grace period of thirty years in which no inquiries into their faith would be allowed; this was later to be extended to end in 1534. A popular riot in 1504 would end in the death of two thousand Jews; the leaders of this riot were executed by Manuel.\n\nIn 1744, Frederick II of Prussia limited Breslau to only ten so-called \"protected\" Jewish families and encouraged similar practice in other Prussian cities. In 1750 he issued \"Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft\": the \"protected\" Jews had an alternative to \"either abstain from marriage or leave Berlin\" (quoting Simon Dubnow). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria Maria Theresa ordered Jews out of Bohemia but soon reversed her position, on condition that Jews pay for readmission every ten years. This extortion was known as \"malke-geld\" (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, Joseph II abolished most of persecution practices in his \"Toleranzpatent\", on the condition that Yiddish and Hebrew are eliminated from public records and judicial autonomy is annulled. Moses Mendelssohn wrote that \"Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution\".\n\nMartin Luther, an Augustinian monk and an ecclesiastical reformer whose teachings inspired the Protestant Reformation, wrote antagonistically about Jews in his book \"On the Jews and their Lies\", which describes the Jews in extremely harsh terms, excoriates them, and provides detailed recommendations for a pogrom against them and their permanent oppression and/or expulsion. At one point in \"On the Jews and Their Lies\", Martin Luther goes even as far to write \"that we are at fault in not slaying them.\" According to Paul Johnson, it \"may be termed the first work of modern anti-Semitism, and a giant step forward on the road to the Holocaust.\"\nIn his final sermon shortly before his death, however, Luther preached \"We want to treat them with Christian love and to pray for them, so that they might become converted and would receive the Lord.\" Still, Luther's harsh comments about the Jews are seen by many as a continuation of medieval Christian anti-Semitism.\n\"See also Martin Luther and Anti-Semitism\"\n\n"}

It was originally known as the Party for Democratic Renewal. The PRD of Djibouti was created with the purpose of forming a national democratic party. The PRD gained popularity at the collapse of the communist bloc and the end of the Cold War. It used its military power gained through its coalition with the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) and the Movement for Peace and Reconciliation (MPR). The current leader of PRD is Abdillani Hamariteha.\n\nThe PRD was founded by Mohamed Djame Elabe, a former minister in the government, on 27 September 1992; it replaced the Movement for Peace and Reconciliation, a group founded by Djame in early 1992. The party participated in the December 1992 parliamentary election and won 24.41% of vote, although it obtained no representation in the National Assembly; no other opposition party participated in the election, and all seats were won by the ruling People's Rally for Progress (RPP).\n\nStanding as the PRD presidential candidate in the May 1993 presidential election, Djame placed second behind President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and received about 22% of the vote. Djame died on 26 November 1996, and the PRD held a congress on 23 May 1997, electing Hamariteha as PRD President, Maki Houmed Gaba as First Vice-President, and Carton Dibeth Oblik as Second Vice-President.\n\nIn the December 1997 parliamentary election, the PRD received 19.2% of the vote but again failed to win any seats. Together with the leaders of the Group for Democracy and the Republic and the Djibouti United Opposition Front, Hamariteha signed a communiqué providing for an alliance between the three groups on 25 November 1998. In the parliamentary election held on 10 January 2003, the PRD was part of the Union for a Democratic Change (\"Union pour l'Alternance Démocratique\"), which won 37.3% of the popular vote but no seats in the National Assembly.\n"}

The organisations specialise in improving health and education services and livelihood opportunities for disadvantaged populations and most of this work takes place in Nepal. The acronym, PHASE, stands for \"Practical Help Achieving Self Empowerment\" and describes the working ethic of the organisations.\n\nPHASE was founded in 2005 by a group of friends, united by an interest in working in Nepal. PHASE later established several partnerships and now operates as PHASE Austria, PHASE Nepal, NTTI and PHASE Worldwide.\n\nPHASE Nepal implements community based projects in remote communities in Nepal. The organisation aims to help the most vulnerable in Nepalese villages to make their way out of poverty. PHASE Nepal works with communities and local authorities to build the foundations for a future that does not rely on outside sources of funding. PHASE Nepal has its headquarters in Dadhikot just south of the Araniko Highway between Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, Nepal. During 2017 they received support from and are working with Medecins du Monde on new health promotion work.\n\nPHASE works with remote Himalayan communities aiming to reduce poverty by improving health, education and improving livelihood opportunities.\nIn 2009, PHASE Nepal received a grant from the British Medical Association (BMA) Humanitarian Fund enabling it to publish clinical treatment guidelines for health workers in Nepal. In 2014 PHASE Nepal had over 40 health workers supporting health posts in 13 communities. In 2016/17, over 100,000 people were seen at PHASE supported health centres. \n\nPHASE Austria raises funds for various aspects of PHASE Nepal’s work, with an initial focus on the field of education, but more recently also in healthcare and livelihoods. Since 2011, PHASE Austria has secured grants for its work from the City of Vienna, NAK Humanitas and the Austrian Ministry of Sports. Following the devastating 2015 earthquakes, PHASE Austria also contributed important funds for PHASE's efforts in disaster relief and reconstruction. In 2017, PHASE Austria was awarded the Else Kröner-Fresenius Preis für medizinische Entwicklungszusammenarbeit, a prestigious award in medical development cooperation, for the PHASE integrated programme for the improvement of healthcare for mothers and children in Mugu, Western Nepal.\n\nPHASE Worldwide raises funds and provides technical expertise to PHASE Nepal. The headquarters are in Rotherham, UK. A board of trustees oversees the organisation to ensure that its core values and purpose are reflected in the way it operates. PHASE Worldwide received funding in 2014 from the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) and was still being funded by them in 2017. It is registered with the UK Charity Commission.\n\n\nPHASE works in partnership with individual volunteers and organisations to improve the delivery of programmes. Partnerships include the Child Welfare Scheme, volunteering programmes for NHS health professionals, links with the University of Sheffield and St George's, University of London that allow students to experience Nepal as part of their education, partnerships with several hospitals, general practices in the UK which support work in Nepal, and a partnership with Hewlett-Packard who provided a team of PHASE health workers with notebook computers for their health posts and a notebook for electronic storage in the Nepal headquarters.\n\nBrian Blessed, a film and stage actor, was born and grew up in Rotherham, where PHASE was established. He is a patron of PHASE Worldwide. Rosie Swale-Pope is an adventurer, author and marathon runner from Switzerland. In 2003, she ran the 1,7000 kilometres across Nepal and set a new world record as she completed it within 68 days which raised funds for a PHASE health camp in Humla, Nepal. She is a patron of PHASE Worldwide.\n\nAlex Staniforth became an ambassador for PHASE in 2016. Staniforth has twice attempted to conquer Everest but was prevented from doing so by the 2015 Nepal earthquake. In the aftermath of the disaster, Alex worked with PHASE to raise over £15,000 for the disaster relief fund and helped to organise the 'Walk for Nepal' event on the anniversary of the earthquake in 2016.

Daylight saving time is not used in Russia (since March 2011).\n\nSince 28 October 2018, the time zones are as follows:\n\nDaylight saving time in Russia was originally introduced on 30 June [13 July, ] 1917 by a decree of the Russian Provisional Government. However, it was abandoned by a Decree of the Soviet government five months later.\n\nDaylight saving time was re-introduced in the USSR on 1 April 1981, by a decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. Daylight saving time began on 1 April and ended on 1 October each year, until mid-1984, when the USSR began following European daylight saving time rules, moving clocks forward one hour at 02:00 local standard time on the last Sunday in March, and back one hour at 03:00 local daylight time on the last Sunday in September until 1995, after which the change back occurred on the last Sunday in October. The usage of daylight saving time continued after the Soviet collapse but ended in 2011, when Russia stopped observing daylight saving time.\n\nOn 27 March 2011, clocks were advanced as usual, but they did not go back on 30 October 2011, effectively making Moscow Time permanently. On 26 October 2014, following another change in the law, the clocks in most of the country were moved back one hour, but summer Daylight Time was not reintroduced; Moscow Time returned to permanently. Since this reform, most Russian territories have a standard time ahead of mean solar time, including some cities which are ahead by a whole hour. For example, St. Petersburg at 30°E [+2h (*solar time)] has , Yekaterinburg at 60°E (+4h*) has , and Vladivostok at 132°E (+9h*) has .\n\nIn the Russian Empire, most of the nation observed solar time. During the late 19th century, Moscow Mean Time was introduced on 1 January [13 January, N.S.] 1880, originally at . 2:30:17 corresponds to 37.6166667°, the longitude of Moscow. Other parts of Russia kept solar time for several years. At this time, Russia had the Julian calendar with 12 or 13 days less date compared to Western Europe, so it is possible to say the Moscow actually had GMT-285:29:43 (GMT-11d 21h 29m 43s) (29 February [12 March, N.S.] 1800 − 28 February [12 March, N.S.] 1900), GMT-309:29:43 (GMT-12d 21h 29m 43s) (29 February [13 March, N.S.] 1900 − 3 July [16 July, N.S.] 1916) and GMT-309:28:41 (GMT-12d 21h 28m 41s) (3 July [16 July, N.S.] 1916 − 31 January [13 February, N.S.] 1918). Russia adopted the Gregorian calendar on Thursday, 14 February 1918, which most of Europe already used.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union was created, Moscow Time became and the various other time zones (up to UTC+12) were introduced throughout Russia and the rest of the Soviet Union, for example Irkutsk Time GMT+7 (Irkutsk has since this always been MSK+5). Between 1917-1922 the time was less ordered, with daylight savings time some of those years, some with two hours addition, and some of those years with one or two hours extra winter time.\n\nOn 21 June 1930, the Soviet Union advanced all clocks by one hour, effectively making the nation run on daylight saving time all year (the so-called decree time).\n\nOn 1 April 1981, daylight saving time (two hours ahead of standard time) was re-introduced; clocks were moved one hour forward on 1 April (the last Sunday of March since 1985) and one hour back on 1 October (the last Sunday of September since 1984, the last Sunday of October since 1996).\n\nOn 1 April 1981, 00:00:00, Oymyakonsky District changed its time zone from MSK+6 to MSK+8.\n\nThe change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+9 to UTC+12, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+9 to UTC+11. \n\nOn 1 April 1982, 00:00:00, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug changed its time zone from MSK+10 to MSK+9, thus eliminating Anadyr Time (MSK+10 or UTC+13 without DST).\n\nThe change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+14 to UTC+13, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+13 to UTC+12.\n\nOn 27 March 1988, 02:00:00, Saratov and Volgograd oblasts changed its time zone from MSK+1 to MSK.\n\nThe change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+5 to UTC+4, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+4 to UTC+3.\n\nOn 26 March 1989, the following changes were introduced, which, in particular, some oblasts switched to Moscow Time (thus eliminating Samara Time; MSK+1 or UTC+4 without DST):\n\n\nSome oblasts switched from Moscow Time to Eastern European Time:\n\n\nRussia and most republics in the Soviet Union abolished the decree time (not moving the clocks) on 31 March 1991, but Russia reversed this the following year (except Samara Oblast which was already in ).\n\nOn 29 September 1991, 03:00:00, Samara Oblast changed its time zone from MSK to MSK+1 (thus reinstating Samara Time; MSK+1). So the zone boundaries on 20 October, Samara Oblast changed its time zone from to .\n\nOn 23 May 1993, 00:00:00, Novosibirsk Oblast changed its time zone from MSK+4 to MSK+3.\n\nThe change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+8 to UTC+7, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+7 to UTC+6.\n\nOn 28 May 1995, 00:00:00, Altai Krai and Altai Republic changed its time zone from MSK+4 to MSK+3.\n\nOn 30 March 1997, 02:00:00, Sakhalin Oblast changed its time zone from MSK+8 to MSK+7.\n\nOn 1 May 2002, 03:00:00, Tomsk Oblast changed its time zone from MSK+4 to MSK+3.\n\nOn 1 January 2004, 00:00:00, New Siberian Islands, Tomponsky District and Ust-Maysky District changed its time zone from MSK+6 to MSK+7.\n\nThe following time zone changes occurred on 28 March 2010, which, in particular, led to abolition of two of the eleven time zones.\n\n\nAlthough the Russian government wants to reduce the number of time zones even further, there have been protests in far-eastern Russia on the recent changes, including protests and a 20,000-strong petition in support of Kamchatka returning to UTC+12.\n\nThe decree No. 725 (31 August 2011) changed UTC offset for Moscow Time and the other time zones. Moscow Time Zone now used all year around. The notions of decree time and daylight saving time were abolished in the law, but in fact, this law mandated permanent daylight saving time (or even double daylight saving time in regions that had not abolished the decree time). Some areas changed offset from Moscow:\n\nSome districts of the Sakha Republic switched from Magadan Time (Zone 9) to Vladivostok Time (from Zone 8):\n\nSome districts of the Sakha Republic switched from Vladivostok Time (Zone 8) to Yakutsk Time (Zone 7):\nBlue Yakutsk Time (MSK+6), pink Vladivostok Time (MSK+7), red Magadan Time (MSK+8).\n\nAs a result of the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, local authorities in the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol decreed that clocks in the newly proclaimed Russian federal subjects should jump ahead two hours at 10 p.m. on 29 March 2014 to switch from Eastern European Time (UTC+2) to Moscow Time (UTC+4).\n\nOn 22 July 2014, further changes were passed, which took effect on 26 October 2014. All of Russia moved back one hour, so Moscow Time became .\nSome areas changed offset from Moscow:\nAnnual DST changes is not observed.\n\nThe following time zone changes occurred on 27 March 2016:\n\nThe following time zone change occurred on 24 April 2016:\n\nAfter these changes, the UTC+11:00 time zone is also named Magadan Time or Sakhalin Time.\n\nThe following time zone change occurred on 29 May 2016:\n\nThe following time zone change occurred on 24 July 2016:\n\n\nThe following time zone change occurred on 4 December 2016:\n\n\nThe following time zone change occurred on 28 October 2018:\n\n\nAll timetables on Russian Railways (except Sakhalin railways) follow Moscow Time.

In other words, the clocks did not change, but the names of the time zones reverted permanently to their standard time variants and there will be no more daylight-saving time. \n\nIf available, the change column lists the offset changes that caused a creation of a new zone in the tz database.\n\n\"Initial zone\" means that in 1970 there was already a difference in time offset from the offsets in any other zone.\n\nAsia/Ulan Ude was a time zone identifier from the zone file of the tz database.

This need was made manifest by the damage and destruction wrought by nature at his original 1903 South Wellfleet location. The erosion and wind damage suffered by Marconi's first Cape Cod station continues to this day. Almost the entirety of the historic station is now long gone over the cliffs onto the beach and into the waters of the Atlantic below. \n\nMarconi realized that a permanent presence would require a more inland and somewhat sheltered location. So it was that Marconi's Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America built his new trans-oceanic receiver station in Chatham and its companion high power trans-oceanic transmitter station forty miles to the west in Marion, Massachusetts through a contract with J.G. White Engineering Corp.\n\nIn 1920, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America sold the Chatham and Marion stations to the Radio Corporation of America. RCA removed all remaining Marconi equipment from the Chatham receiver station and converted it to a public coast station for communications with ships at sea. In 1921 Chatham was licensed under the callsign WCC for communications on 500 kHz, 750 kHz and 1 MHz. In 1922 RCA moved the WCC radio transmitters to the Marion transmitter station to eliminate co-site interference to the sensitive receivers at Chatham. In 1929 WCC Marion began operations on maritime HF frequencies (6, 8, 12, 16 and 22 MHz).\n\nIn 1948, the WCC marine radio transmitter equipment was moved from Marion Station to RCA's newly built oceanfront transmitter station on Forest Beach Road in South Chatham, Massachusetts. The U.S. Air Force continued to use the Alexanderson alternator at Marion Station for weather and other broadcasts to its air base in Thule, Greenland and other arctic locations through 1957 under the callsign AFA2.\n\nIn 1951, RCA sold Marion Station to the U.S. Government and the U.S General Services Administration sold it to a private investor in 1960. Most of the 143 acres that comprised the Marion Station was donated to the Sippican Lands Trust in 1986 and is publicly accessible. Radio Tower Property\n\nIn 1988, RCA Global Communications sold the WCC stations to Western Union International, a subsidiary of MCI Communications, as part of the breakup of RCA. In 1993 WCC became a remotely controlled station, using fiber optic cable to receive signals, transmit signals and issue such commands such as selecting and rotating directional antennas. Even the keying of Morse Code (CW) and Radioteletype (RTTY) was issued remotely at this early date in the public internet's infancy. WCC was operated from KPH Radio in Point Reyes, California until its closing.\n\nIn 1999, MCI/Worldcom sold the WCC receiver station in Chatham and the transmitter station on Forest Beach Road in South Chatham — nearly 100 acres in total — to the town of Chatham for a fraction of their value.\n\nThe Chatham receiver station is now the Chatham Marconi Maritime Center, and the home of amateur radio station WA1WCC, licensed to the WCC Amateur Radio Association. The South Chatham transmitter station is now preserved in its entirely as the Forest Beach Conservation Area by the town of Chatham. \n\nThe callsign WCC is now used by Globe Wireless by a Maryland station it operates to transmit automated e-mail-by-radio.\n\nChatham station was the subject of the Mooncusser Films documentary \"Chatham Radio: WCC the Untold Story\", narrated by Walter Cronkite and directed by Christopher Seufert.\n\n\n\n"}
