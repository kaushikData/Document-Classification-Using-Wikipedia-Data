This was the PRC's 3rd constitution, and was adopted at the 1st Meeting of the 5th National People's Congress on March 5, 1978, two years after the downfall of the Gang of Four.\n\nThe number of articles grew from the 1975 Constitution's 30 articles to double the amount. The courts and the procurates, which were minimised or dumped altogether in the 1975 Constitution of the People's Republic of China, were somewhat restored. A number of checks and balances present in the 1954 Constitution, including term limits for party leaders, elections and more independence in the judiciary, were restored.\n\nThe 1978 Constitution was the first Constitution in the PRC to touch explicitly on the political status of Taiwan. It said that \"Taiwan is part of China\" and said that the PRC \"must liberate Taiwan, and finish the great task of reunifying the motherland\". However, in 1979, the PRC dropped the liberation stance and opted for peaceful reunification instead. Notice the usage of the word \"China\" in the 1978 Constitution; the 1982 Constitution mentioned that \"Taiwan is a sacred part of the territory of the People's Republic of China\" instead of just \"China\".\n\nCitizen rights were also reinstated somewhat. The right to strike was still present, although it would be removed in the 1982 Constitution. However, the required support for the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system remained as part of citizens' duties.\n\nHowever, the Constitution still suffered from the backdrop of the just-gone-by Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary language was still persistent (such as \"Revolutionary Committees\"), although the slogans were gone. The 1978 Constitution survived for four years before being superseded by the current (1982) Constitution of the People's Republic of China during the Deng Xiaoping era.\n"}

It is similar to Soleares. Its beat emphasis is as follows: 1 2 [3] 4 5 [6] 7 [8] 9 [10] 11 [12]. Alegrías originated in Cádiz. Alegrías belongs to the group of \"palos\" called Cantiñas and it is usually played in a lively rhythm (120-170 beats per minute). The livelier speeds are chosen for dancing, while quieter rhythms are preferred for the song alone.\n\nOne of the structurally strictest forms of flamenco, a traditional dance in alegrías must contain each of the following sections: a salida (entrance), paseo (walkaround), silencio (similar to an adagio in ballet), castellana (upbeat section) zapateado (Literally \"a tap of the foot\") and bulerías. This structure though, is not followed when alegrías are sung as a standalone song (with no dancing). In that case, the stanzas are combined freely, sometimes together with other types of cantiñas.\n\nRecommended listenings for this \"palo\" include most singers from Cádiz, like Chano Lobato, La Perla de Cádiz, Aurelio Sellé, but also general singers like Manolo Caracol or La Niña de los Peines.\n\nAlso, you can listen \"Mar Amargo\" from Camarón and \"La Tarde es Caramelo\" from Vicente Amigo.\n\nIt is one of the cante chico forms of flamenco. The word Alegrías literally means \"joys.\"\n\nÁLVAREZ CABALLERO, Ángel: \"La discoteca ideal del flamenco\", Editorial Planeta, Barcelona, 1995 \n\n"}

Along with the \"Ostasiatische Zeitschrift\" (founded in 1912) it was one of the most successful journals in its field in the German-speaking part of Europe. The first number of \"Artibus Asiae\" appeared in 1925. While earlier issues contained articles in German, French and English, today's contributions are mainly in English. \"Artibus Asiae\" is owned and published by the Museum Rietberg in Zurich. \"Artibus Asiae\" also published occasional monographs since 1937.\n\nThe first volume of the journal was published by the Avalun-Verlag Hellerau-Dresden in 1925 and was edited by Carl Hentze (1883–1975) and Alfred Salmony (1890–1958). The early volumes appeared in four issues each, up to vol. 59. All subsequent volumes were published in two parts. \n\nThe typographer, publisher and later editor-in-chief Richard Hadl (1876–1944) had worked for the Leipzig-based publisher \"Drugulin\" as a director since 1922. \"Drugulin\" was one of the leading publishing houses and known for their wide array of unusual typesets. Hadl established his own publishing house, \"Offizin Richard Hadl\", in 1926. and published five volumes of the journal \"Artibus Asiae\".\n\nDuring the Second World War all publishing activities were moved to Switzerland and the journal would only appear irregularly. Vol. 8 no. 1 was the first issue to be published in Switzerland, printed by the \"Kommissionsverlag Braus Riggenbach\" in Basel. All further volumes were published by \"Artibus Asiae\" in Ascona, where Hadl and his co-worker and publisher, Luise C. Tarabori-Flesch from Trier had settled in 1938/39. After Hadl had died in 1944, Miss Flesch kept the journal afloat on her own until 1946, when Alfred Salmony became editor-in-chief. Salmony edited the journal until his death in 1958.\n\n\"Artibus Asiae\"'s link to the current owner, the Museum Rietberg, was established through the museums's former director Elsy Leuzinger, who edited an issue (vol. 20 no. 1, 1957) to commemorate the founding donor of the Museum Rietberg, Eduard von der Heydt. In 1985 (from vol. 46 on), the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation started to sponsor the journal. The Museum Rietberg was granted a special publication endowment in 1991 (vol. 51) and it henceforth became the owner of both the journal and the monograph series.\n\nThe following persons have served as editors-in-chief of \"Artibus Asiae\":\nLonger articles submitted to \"Artibus Asiae\" were often split into parts and published in several numbers of the journal. \"Artibus Asiae\" started to publish monographs on selected topics in 1937 to allow more lengthy contributions to the field. They are conceived as a supplemental series to the journal and present a broad range of lavishly illustrated studies. Early monographs were on topics only remotely related to the arts, such as publications on the Tibetan grammar books Sum cu pa and Rtags kyi ‘ajug or on Chinese literature. \n"}

Her origins are varied depending on region.\n\nThe most popular myth of Tala is that she is one of the three daughters of Bathala to a mortal woman. Her sisters include Mayari, the goddess of the moon and Hanan, the goddess of morning. She is known to have supported the creation of the Tagalog traditional constellations. Tala used light spheres or orbs to ferry men to safety at night, however, when the Spaniards came, they demonized the light orbs and called it santelmos in a bid to convert the natives into Christianity. The natives eventually regarded the orbs as deadly beings that kill men or get humans to lose their way.\n\nIn another, more modern story, sun god Arao (probably Apolaki) and the moon goddess Buan (probably Mayari) both had large families of stars, but Buan believed her stars could not survive the heat of Arao. They both agreed to destroy their stars. While Arao devoured his, Buan hid hers in the clouds, where they would occasionally emerge. Upon seeing this, Arao was filled with rage and is eternally in pursuit of Buan, trying to destroy her. Eclipses are explained by Arao getting close enough to bite her. At dawn, Buan hides the stars and brings them forth only when her eldest daughter, Tala (the evening and morning star) says the sun is too far away to pursue them.\n\nDerived from this myth are the Tagalog words \"tala\", which means \"bright star\", \"araw\" (sun) and \"buwan\" (moon).\n\nThis story has very close parallels to stories among non-Filipino cultures such as the Bihar, Semang, Savara and the Bhuiya tribes.\n\nIn Kapampangan mythology, a deity named Tálâ is also present. For the Kapampangans, Tálâ is the bright star and the one who introduced wet-rice culture in Pampanga.\n"}

It was mindful of the 1993 Cairo Declaration which stipulated that the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) would anticipate and prevent conflicts as a primary objective and the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty which was an important contribution to regional peace and security.\n\nThe Council was concerned at the continuation of armed conflicts in Africa which had led to mass displacement, poverty, instability and suffering. There were destabilising effects of illegal arms transfers, armed militias and the use of mercenaries across the continent. It was noted that African countries had made progress towards economic reform and democratisation with respect for human rights. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees were ready to assist in humanitarian and refugee crises in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law.\n\nThe Security Council welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Africa, which detailed the sources of conflict on the continent and ways to address it. Kofi Annan had made recommendations concerning arms trafficking, sanctions, refugees, structural adjustment, development assistance and debt and trade. He also emphasised the responsibility of African leaders in regional conflicts and economic failures, and the dangers of foreign intervention. The resolution stressed that challenges in Africa demanded a comprehensive response and that all United Nations agencies, international organisations and all countries would consider the recommendations in the report.\n\nA Working Group consisting of all members of the Council was then established for a period of six months to review the recommendations in the report and consider ways of implementing them and submit proposals for consideration in September 1998 when a ministerial level meeting would be convened. The Council stressed the need for close co-operation between it and the OAU and commended the efforts of the OAU in conflict prevention. At the same time, contributions from Member States, regional organisations and United Nations agencies towards peacekeeping operations in Africa were welcomed.\n\n\n"}
