{"id": "30857496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30857496", "title": "Aramaic of Hatra", "text": "Aramaic of Hatra\n\nAramaic of Hatra refers to inscriptions from the site of the ancient city of Hatra that were published by W. Andrae in 1912 and were studied by S. Ronzevalle and P. Jensen. The excavations undertaken by the Iraqi Department of Antiquities brought to light more than 100 new texts, the publication of which was undertaken by F. Safar in the journal \"Sumer\". The first four series were the subject of reviews in the journal \"Syria\". The texts range in date from the 2nd or 3rd century BCE to the destruction of the city c. 240 CE; the earliest dated text provides a date of 98 BCE.\n\nFor the most part, these inscriptions are short commemorative graffiti with minimal text. The longest of the engraved inscriptions does not have more than 13 lines. It is therefore difficult to identify more than a few features of the Aramaic dialect of Hatra, which shows overall the greatest affinity to Syriac.\n\nThe stone inscriptions bear witness to an effort to establish a monumental script. This script is little different from that of the Aramaic inscriptions of Assur (possessing the same triangular \"š\", and the use of the same means to avoid confusion between \"m\", \"s\", and \"q\"). The \"d\"s and the \"r\"s are not distinguished from one another, and it is sometimes difficult not to confuse \"w\" and \"y\".\n\nThe dialect of Hatra is no more consistent than that of Palmyra in its use of \"matres lectiones\" to indicate the long vowels \"ō\" and \"ī\"; the pronominal suffix of the 3rd person plural is written indiscriminantly, and in the same inscription one finds \"hwn\" and \"hn, the quantifier \"kwl\" and \"kl \"all\", the relative pronoun \"dy and \"d, and the word \"byš and \"bš \"evil\".\n\nThe following features are attested:\n\nA weakening of \"‘ayn\"; in one inscription, the masculine singular demonstrative adjective is written ‘dyn (‘dyn ktb’ \"this inscription\") which corresponds to Mandaic and Jewish Babylonian Aramaic \"hādēn\". Similar demonstratives, \"‘adī\" and \"‘adā\", are attested in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic.\n\n\nThe divine name \"Nergal\", written nrgl, appears in three inscriptions. The pronunciation \"nergōl\" is also attested in the Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin, 63b) where it rhymes with \"tarnəgōl\", \"cock.\"\n\nThe Hatran b-yld corresponds to the Syriac \"bēt yaldā\" \"anniversary\". The apocope of the final consonant of the substantive bt in the construct state is not attested in either Old Aramaic or Syriac; it is, however, attested in other dialects such as Jewish Babylonian Aramaic and Jewish Palestinian Aramaic.\n\n\nThe distinction between the three states is apparent. As in Syriac, the masculine plural form of the emphatic state has the inflection \"-ē\", written -’. The confusion of this form with that of the construct state may explain the constructions bn’ šmšbrk \"sons of Š.\" and bn’ ddhwn \"their cousins.\" The absolute state is scarcely used: klbn \"dogs\" and dkyrn \"(that they may be) remembered.\"\n\nThe ancient Semitic construction, according to which the counted noun, in the plural, is preceded by a numeral in the construct state, with an inversion of genders, is attested by one inscription: tltt klbn \"three dogs.\" This same construction has been discovered in Nabataean: tltt qysrym \"the three Caesars.\"\n\nAs in Syriac, the analytical construction of the noun complement is common. The use of the construct state appears to be limited to kinship terms and some adjectives: bryk’ ꜥh’. In the analytical construction, the definite noun is either in the emphatic state followed by d(y) (e.g. ṣlm’ dy ... \"statue of...\", spr’ dy brmryn’ \"the scribe of (the god) Barmarēn\") or is marked by the anticipatory pronominal suffix (e.g. qnh dy rꜥ’ \"creator of the earth,\" ꜥl ḥyyhy d ... ’ḥyhy \"for the life of his brother,\" ꜥl zmth dy mn dy ... \"against the hair (Syriac \"zemtā\") of whomever...\"). The complement of the object of the verb is also rendered analytically: ... l’ ldkrhy lnšr qb \"do not make mention of N.\", mn dy lqrhy lꜥdyn ktb’ \"whoever reads this inscription.\"\n\nLikewise, the particle d(y) can have a simple declarative meaning: ... l’ lmr dy dkyr lṭb \"(a curse against whomever) does not say, 'may he be well remembered'\" which can be compared with l’ lmr dy dkyr.\n\nPractically all of the known Hatran words are found in Syriac, including words of Akkadian origin, such as ’rdkl’ \"architect\" (Syriac \"’ardiklā\"), and Parthian professional nouns such as pšgryb’ / pzgryb’ \"inheritor of the throne\" (Syriac pṣgryb’); three new nouns, which appear to denote some religious functions, are presumably of Iranian origin: hdrpṭ’ (which Safar compares with the Zoroastrian Middle Persian hylpt’ \"hērbed\" \"teacher-priest\"), and the enigmatic terms brpdmrk’ and qwtgd/ry’.\n\nMany \"irregularities\" revealed by the texts of Hatra (e.g. the use of the emphatic state in place of the construct state, use of the construct state before the particle dy, inconsistent use of the \"matres lectiones\", etc.) are found systematically in other Aramaic inscriptions throughout the duration of the Parthian Empire, between the third century BCE and the third century CE (previously, in part, at Kandahar, but primarily at Nisa, Avromân, Armazi, Tang-e Sarvak, etc.). We could therefore legitimately ask ourselves if, instead of speaking of \"irregularities,\" which would be due, following each instance, to \"scribal negligence,\" \" archaisms of the language,\" and \"orthographic indecision,\" etc., we should rather speak of the characteristics of these Aramaic dialects in their progressive developments (varying according to each region), which one could label \"vernacular Aramaic\" to distinguish them from \"classical Aramaic.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1680652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1680652", "title": "Fra Mauro map", "text": "Fra Mauro map\n\nThe Fra Mauro map, \"considered the greatest memorial of medieval cartography\", is a map of the world made around 1450 by the Italian cartographer Fra Mauro. It is a circular planisphere drawn on parchment and set in a wooden frame that measures over two by two meters. It includes Asia, the Indian Ocean, Africa, Europe and the Atlantic. It is oriented with south at the top.\n\nThe Fra Mauro world map is a major cartographical work. It took several years to complete and was very expensive to produce. The map contains hundreds of detailed illustrations and more than 3000 descriptive texts. It was the most detailed and accurate representation of the world that had been produced up until that time. As such, the Fra Mauro map is considered one of the most important works in the history of cartography. It marks the end of Bible-based geography in Europe and the beginning of embracing a more scientific way of making maps, placing accuracy ahead of religious or traditional beliefs.\n\nThe maker of the map, Fra Mauro, was a Camaldolese monk from the island of Murano near Venice. He was employed as an accountant and professional cartographer. The map was made for the rulers of Venice and Portugal, two of the main seafaring nations of the time.\n\nThe map is usually on display in the museum Museo Correr in Venice in Italy.\n\nThe map is very large – the full frame measures 2.4 by 2.4 meters. This makes Fra Mauro's \"mappa mundi\" the world's largest extant map from early modern Europe. The map is drawn on high quality vellum and is set in a gilded wooden frame. The large drawings are highly detailed and use a range of expensive colors: blue, red, turquoise, brown, green, and black are among the pigments used.\n\nThe main circular map of the world is surrounded by four smaller spheres: \n\nAbout 3000 inscriptions and detailed texts describe the various geographical features on the map as well as related information about them. The depiction of inhabited places and mountains, the map's chorography is also an important feature. Castles and cities are identified by pictorial glyphs representing turreted castles or walled towns, distinguished in order of their importance.\n\nThe making of the map was a major undertaking and the map took several years to complete. The map was not created by Fra Mauro alone, but by a team of cartographers, artists and copyists led by him and using some of the most expensive techniques available at the time. The price of the map would have been about an average copyist's annual salary.\n\nThe studio of Fra Mauro produced two original editions of the map. In addition there is at least one high-quality physical reproduction on the same material. \nIn 1804 the British cartographer William Frazer made a full reproduction of the map on vellum. Although the reproduction is exact, there are minor differences between it and the Venetian original. The Frazer reproduction is currently on display in the British Library in London. In this article, some images are from the Venetian edition and some are from the Frazer reproduction.\n\nA number of historians of cartography, starting with Giacinto Placido Zurla (1806) have studied Fra Mauro's map. A critical edition of the map was edited by Piero Falchetta in 2006.\n\nThe Fra Mauro world map is unusual, but typical of Fra Mauro's portolan charts, in that its orientation is with the south at the top. One explanation for why the map places south at the top is that 15th-century compasses were south-pointing. In addition, south at the top was used in Arab maps of the time. In contrast, most European \"mappae mundi\" from the era placed east at the top, since east was the direction of the biblical Garden of Eden. Other well-known world maps of the time such as the Ptolemy map places the north at the top. Fra Mauro was aware of the religious importance of the east, as well as of the Ptolemy map, and felt the need to defend why he changed the orientation in his new world map:\n\"I do not think it derogatory to Ptolemy if I do not follow his Cosmografia, because, to have observed his meridians or parallels or degrees, it would be necessary in respect to the setting out of the known parts of this circumference, to leave out many provinces not mentioned by Ptolemy. But principally in latitude, that is from south to north, he has much 'terra incognita', because in his time it was unknown\". (Text from Fra Mauro map)\n\nIn another break from tradition, Jerusalem is not shown as the center of world. Fra Mauro justifies the change in this way:\n\"Jerusalem is indeed the center of the inhabited world latitudinally, though longitudinally it is somewhat to the west, but since the western portion is more thickly populated by reason of Europe, therefore Jerusalem is also the center longitudinally if we regard not empty space but the density of population\". (Text from Fra Mauro map)\n\nThe European part of the map, closest to Fra Mauro's home in Venice, is the most accurate. The map depicts the Mediterranean, the Atlantic coast, the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea and extends as far as Iceland. The coasts of the Mediterranean are very accurate and every major island and land mass is depicted. Many cities and rivers, and mountain ranges of Europe are included.\n\nTwo legends on the map describe England and Scotland. They talk about giants, the Saxons and St George:\n\n\"Note that in ancient times Anglia [England] was inhabited by giants, but some Trojans who had survived the slaughter of Troy came to this island, fought its inhabitants and defeated them; after their prince, Brutus, it was named Britannia. But later the Saxons and the Germans conquered it, and after one of their queens, Angela, called it Anglia. And these peoples were converted to the Faith by means of St. Gregory the pope, who sent them a bishop called Augustine.\"\n\n\"As it is shown, Scotia [Scotland] appears contiguous to Anglia, but in its southern part it is divided from it by water and mountains. The people are of easy morals and are fierce and cruel against their enemies; and they prefer death to servitude. The island is very fertile in pastures, rivers, springs and animals and all other things; and it is like Anglia.\"\n\nScandinavia is the least accurate part of the European section. A legend describing Norway and Sweden describes tall, strong and fierce people, polar bears and St. Bridget of Sweden:\n\n\"Norvegia [Norway] is a very vast province surrounded by the sea and joined to Svetia [Sweden]. Here they produce no wine or oil, and the people are strong, robust and of great stature. Similarly, in Svetia the men are very fierce; and according to some, Julius Caesar was not eager to face them in battle. Similarly, these peoples were a great affliction to Europe; and at the time of Alexander, the Greeks did not have the courage to subjugate them. But now they are much diminished and do not have the reputation they formerly had. Here is said to be the body of St. Bridgit, who some say was from Svetia. And it is also said there are many new kinds of animals, especially huge white bears and other savage animals.\"\n\nThe Asian part of the map shows the Arabian peninsula, Persia, the Indian subcontinent including the island of Sri Lanka, the islands of Java and Sumatra as well as Burma, China and the Korean peninsula. The Caspian Sea, which is bordering Europe, has an accurate shape but the outline of Southern Asia is distorted. India has been split in two halves. Major rivers such as the Tigris, the Indus, the Ganges, the Yellow River and the Yangtze are depicted. Cities include Baghdad, Beijing, Bokhara and Ayutthaya.\n\nThe Fra Mauro map is one of the first Western maps to represent the islands of Japan (possibly after the De Virga world map). A part of Japan, probably Kyūshū, appears below the island of Java, with the legend \"Isola de Cimpagu\" (a misspelling of Cipangu).\n\nThe description of Africa is reasonably accurate.\n\nSome of the islands named in the area of the southern tip of Africa bear Arabian and Indian names: \"Nebila\" (\"celebration\" or \"beautiful\" in Arabic), and \"Mangla\" (\"fortunate\" in Sanskrit). These are normally identified as the \"Islands of Men and Women\" mentioned under . According to an old Arabian legend as retold by Marco Polo, one of these islands was populated exclusively by men and the other was populated exclusively by women, and the two would only meet for conjugal relations once a year. Their location was not certain and the location proposed by Fra Mauro is but one of multiple possibilities: Marco Polo himself located them in the neighborhood of Socotra, and other medieval cartographers offered locations in Southeast Asia, near Singapore or in the Philippines. It is generally thought that the islands are mythical.\n\nThe Indian Ocean is accurately depicted as connected to the Atlantic. Several groups of smaller islands such as the Andamans and the Maldives are shown. Fra Mauro puts the following inscription by the southern tip of Africa, which he names the \"Cape of Diab\", describing the exploration by a ship from the East around 1420:\n\"Around 1420 a ship, or junk, from India crossed the Sea of India towards the Island of Men and the Island of Women, off Cape Diab, between the Green Islands and the shadows. It sailed for 40 days in a south-westerly direction without ever finding anything other than wind and water. According to these people themselves, the ship went some 2,000 miles ahead until - once favourable conditions came to an end - it turned round and sailed back to Cape Diab in 70 days\".\n\n\"The ships called junks (lit. \"Zonchi\") that navigate these seas carry four masts or more, some of which can be raised or lowered, and have 40 to 60 cabins for the merchants and only one tiller. They can navigate without a compass, because they have an astrologer, who stands on the side and, with an astrolabe in hand, gives orders to the navigator\". (Text from the Fra Mauro map, 09-P25.)\n\nFra Mauro explained that he obtained the information from \"a trustworthy source\", who traveled with the expedition, possibly the Venetian explorer Niccolò de' Conti who happened to be in Calicut, India at the time the expedition left:\n\n\"What is more, I have spoken with a person worthy of trust, who says that he sailed in an Indian ship caught in the fury of a tempest for 40 days out in the Sea of India, beyond the Cape of Soffala and the Green Islands towards west-southwest; and according to the astrologers who act as their guides, they had advanced almost 2,000 miles. Thus one can believe and confirm what is said by both these and those, and that they had therefore sailed 4,000 miles\".\n\nFra Mauro also comments that the account of the expedition, together with the relation by Strabo of the travels of Eudoxus of Cyzicus from Arabia to Gibraltar through the southern Ocean in Antiquity, led him to believe that the Indian Ocean was not a closed sea and that Africa could be circumnavigated by her southern end (Text from Fra Mauro map, 11, G2). This knowledge, together with the map depiction of the African continent, probably encouraged the Portuguese to intensify their ultimately successful effort to round the tip of Africa.\n\nOther than Greenland, the Americas were unknown to Europeans in 1450. Greenland is included in the map as a reference to \"Grolanda\".\n\nAs was generally the case among medieval scholars, Fra Mauro regarded the world as a sphere. However, he used the convention of describing the continents surrounded by water within the shape of a disc. In one of the texts, the map includes an estimate of the circumference of the earth:\n\n\"Likewise I have found various opinions regarding this circumference, but it is not possible to verify them. It is said to be 22,500 or 24,000 \"miglia\" or more, or less according to various considerations and opinions, but they are not of much authenticity, since they have not been tested.\"\n\n\"Miglia\" is Italian for miles, a unit that was invented by the Romans but which had not yet been standardized in 1450. If \"miglia\" is taken as the Roman mile, this means the circumference would be about 34,468 km. If \"miglia\" is taken as the Italian mile, the stated circumference would be about 43,059 km. The actual meridional cirumference of the Earth is close to both these values at about 40,008 km or approximately 24,860 English miles. This means that the Fra Mauro map had an accuracy of about 86–92% of the real value when it comes to the circumference of the earth.\n\nThe sources for the map were existing maps, charts and manuscripts which were combined with written and oral accounts of travelers. The text on the map mentions many of these travel accounts.\n\nOne of the main sources were accounts of the journeys of Italian merchant and traveller Niccolò de' Conti. Setting out in 1419, De Conti traveled throughout Asia as far as China and present-day Indonesia during a period of 20 years. In the map many new location names, and several verbatim descriptions, were taken directly from de Conti's account. The \"trustworthy source\" whom Fra Mauro quotes is thought to have been de' Conti himself. The book of travels of Marco Polo is also believed to be one of the most important sources of information, in particular about East Asia. For Africa, Fra Mauro relied on recent accounts of Portuguese exploration along the west coast. The detailed information on the southeastern coast of Africa, was likely brought by an Ethiopian embassy to Rome in the 1430s. Fra Mauro also probably relied on Arab sources. Arab influence is suggested by the North-South inversion of the map, an Arab tradition exemplified by the 12th century maps of Muhammad al-Idrisi.\n\nAs Piero Falchetta notes, there are many geographical facts reflected in Fra Mauro map for which it is not clear what Fra Mauro's source was, as no similar information is found in other preserved Western maps or manuscripts of the period. This situation can be at least partially explained by the fact that, besides the existing maps and manuscripts, an important source of information for his map were oral accounts from travelers - Venetians or foreigners - coming to Venice from all parts of the then-known world. The importance of such accounts is indicated by Fra Mauro himself in a number of inscriptions. An even earlier map, the De Virga world map (1411–1415) also depicts the old world in a way broadly similar to the Fra Mauro map, and may have contributed to it.\n\n\n\n"}

Both countries formed a silent alliance against the Soviet Union and agreed upon sharing intelligence they obtained. The Japanese relied heavily on the new Polish secret service for training in decryption, and continued their close military co-operation even after the Polish declaration of war, which was rejected by Japan for this reason. The Japanese relied on the vast Polish network of spies, and allowed the Poles to openly place their agents inside embassies of its protectorate of Manchukuo. The military cooperation was so close, that in fact the Japanese ambassador was one of the people involved in smuggling of a Polish flag made for the London-based Polish Air Squadron.\n\nDuring World War II, despite being allied with Nazi Germany, the Empire of Japan did not support its invasion of Poland and actively supported the Polish government in exile. This decision was dictated by the Japanese distrust of their Nazi ally, who made a secret pact with the Soviet Union. Thus, the Japanese government decided to continue to rely on Polish spies to gather information on both the Soviet Union and Third Reich. The Japanese agents in Europe during the World War II continued to support Polish struggle for freedom against Soviet Union and Third Reich, and sheltered Polish refugees fleeing occupation from both German and Soviet forces. Throughout this whole secret alliance, the Japanese never used the Polish spy network to obtain information on Polish western allies. The Polish agents never disclosed information about their Western allies and shared information only pertaining to the Third Reich and Soviet Union.\n\nJapanese poem \"Porando kaiko\" of Major Fukushima Yasumasa mentions the Polish struggle for freedom.\n\nJapan established relationship with the PZPR party that represented the Soviet controlled Polish puppet state at 1957, while at the same time continuing to be allied with the London-based Polish national government in exile, and later supported the merging of these two in 1989 to form the modern Polish state. Both share mutual interests and alliance that forged them closer to each other. The two states celebrated 50 years of relationship in 2009.\n\n"}

Athletics records comprise the best performances in the sports of track and field, road running and racewalking.\n\nRecords are kept for all events contested at the Olympic Games and some others. Unofficial records for some other events are kept by track and field statisticians. The only non-metric track distance for which official records are kept is the mile run.\n\nThe Criteria which must be satisfied for ratification also apply to national or other restricted records and also to performances submitted as qualifying marks for eligibility to compete in major events such as the Olympic Games.\n\nThe criteria include:\n\nWitnessing a world record brings great pleasure for athletics fans, and athletes' personal sponsors and promoters of major meetings such as the IAAF Diamond League and its predecessor, the IAAF Golden League have offered bonuses to athletes breaking a record.\n\nSome middle-distance runners have specialized in acting as pacemakers in longer races, receiving a fee without even finishing the race, and possibly a bonus if a record results. This is a useful occupation for athletes who are capable of running accurately to a specified pace, but not capable of the very fastest times to become champions in their own right.\n\nIn the pole vault record bonuses create an incentive for an athlete capable of smashing a record to instead break it by the minimum amount (one centimetre), multiple times, at multiple meetings, in order to accumulate multiple bonuses. This has been done by Sergey Bubka in the men's pole vault, and Yelena Isinbayeva in the women's pole vault. Some commentators have complained that neither athlete ever posted as high a mark as they were capable of. In any other discipline, except in the high jump, this issue does not arise, since it is practically impossible to deliberately break a record by a small margin.\n\nThe IAAF commenced the recognition of world records in 1912, and indoor world records after 1987. In 2000, IAAF rule 260.18a (formerly 260.6a) was amended, so that \"world records\" (as opposed to \"indoor world records\") can be set in a facility \"with or without roof.\" This rule was not applied retroactively, and has, thus far, only affected the men's and women's pole vault. The women's record has been advanced 9 times indoors by three different women, each ratified as a world record. The last record to be set indoors was in 2004. Sergey Bubka's 1993 pole vault world indoor record of 6.15 m was not considered to be a world record, because it was set before the new rule came into effect. In February 2014, Bubka's record was surpassed indoors by Renaud Lavillenie jumping 6.16 m which qualifies as both the Indoor world record and the world record.\n\nOne current IAAF-sanctioned event, the mixed-sex 4x400 m relay, does not have any recognised world record.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nEvents which do not qualify for IAAF-ratified world records are typically referred to as world bests. While very common in the first half of 20th century, a large number of races over distances by imperial measurements became rare occurrences and the IAAF removed all imperial measured events from its world record lists in 1976 – with the sole exception being the mile run (which remains common due to its historical prominence in track and field).\n\nSome road racing distances and indoor variations of outdoor events fall outside of IAAF's lists. Records set in uncommon events usually do not adhere to the strict criteria found in IAAF-ratifiable events. One example is the 150 metres record, which was set by Usain Bolt on a specially-made straight track, while previous performances (such as the Bailey–Johnson 150-metre race) were completed on a traditional circuit which included a partial bend in the track.\n\nThe 40-yard dash – a standard acceleration evaluation for American Football players – does not fall within the usual criteria of athletics racing events. In most 40-yard dashes, reaction times are not recorded as timing starts only once the player is in motion, and the standards for timing a \"football 40\" are so lax and inconsistent that a real world record cannot be claimed. Performances are hand-timed and calculated to 1/100th of a second, although studies show human beings simply cannot react consistently or accurately enough for this to be a valid method; even those using light beams are timed by the motion of the athlete, still removing the normal factor of reaction time. Football 40-yard dashes are usually run on a turf surface, as opposed to an all weather track. All these factors make track and \"football 40\" performances incomparable. The world best time for a \"football 40\" is 4.17 by Deion Sanders. The extrapolated best for an Olympic level athlete, including reacting to a starting gun, currently is by Maurice Greene at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics with a time of 4.24.<wbr> Under conventional football timing on a turf field in 2017, Christian Coleman reportedly ran a 4.12.\n\nThe men's javelin specification was changed with effect from 1986, and the women's from 2000. The purpose was to reduce the number of illegal flat landings, but a side-effect was to reduce the distance travelled. The prior world records in individual men's and women's javelin were invalidated, but the prior records in decathlon and heptathlon were not.\n\nThe old specification records for men's and women's javelin were as follows:\nThe current decathlon world record was set with the current javelin specification. The best performance in heptathlon using the new specification javelin is:\n\n"}

In other cases, a broadcast may be considered \"pirate\" due to the nature of its content, its transmission format (especially a failure to transmit a station identification according to regulations), or the transmit power (wattage) of the station, even if the transmission is not technically illegal (such as an amateur radio transmission). Pirate radio is sometimes called bootleg radio (a term especially associated with two-way radio), clandestine radio (associated with heavily politically motivated operations) or free radio.\n\nRadio \"piracy\" began with the advent of regulations of the public airwaves in the United States at the dawn of the age of radio. Initially, radio, or wireless as it was more commonly called, was an open field of hobbyists and early inventors and experimenters. The United States Navy began using radio for time signals and weather reports on the east coast of the United States in the 1890s. Before the advent of valve (vacuum tube) technology, early radio enthusiasts used noisy spark-gap transmitters, such as the first spark-gap modulation technology pioneered by the first real audio (rather than telegraph code) radio broadcaster, Charles D. Herrold, in San Jose, California, or the Ruhmkorff coil used by almost all early experimenters. The navy soon began complaining to a sympathetic press that amateurs were disrupting naval transmissions. The May 25, 1907, edition of \"Electrical World\" in an article called \"Wireless and Lawless\" reported authorities were unable to prevent an amateur from interfering with the operation of a government station at the Washington, D.C. Navy Yard using legal means.\n\nIn the run-up to the London Radiotelegraph Convention in 1912 (essentially an international gentlemen's agreement on use of the radio band, non-binding and, on the high seas, completely null), and amid concerns about the safety of marine radio following the sinking of the \"\" on April 15 of that year (although there were never allegations of radio interference in that event), the \"New York Herald\" of April 17, 1912, headlined President William Howard Taft's initiative to regulate the public airwaves in an article titled \"President Moves to Stop Mob Rule of Wireless.\"\n\nWhen the \"Act to Regulate Radio Communication\" was passed on August 13, 1912, amateurs and experimenters were not banned from broadcasting; rather, amateurs were assigned their own frequency spectrum, and licensing and call-signs were introduced. By regulating the public airwaves, President Taft thus created the legal space for illicit broadcasts to take place. An entire federal agency, the Federal Radio Commission, was formed in 1927 and succeeded in 1934 by the Federal Communications Commission. These agencies would enforce rules on call-signs, assigned frequencies, licensing and acceptable content for broadcast.\n\nThe Radio Act of 1912 gave the president legal permission to shut down radio stations \"in time of war\", and during the first two and a half years of World War I, before US entry, President Wilson tasked the US Navy with monitoring US radio stations, nominally to \"ensure neutrality.\" The navy used this authority to shut down amateur radio in the western part of the US (the US was divided into two civilian radio \"districts\" with corresponding call-signs, beginning with \"K\" in the west and \"W\" in the east, in the regulatory measures; the navy was assigned call-signs beginning with \"N\"). When Wilson declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, he also issued an executive order closing most radio stations not needed by the US government. The navy took it a step further and declared it was illegal to listen to radio or possess a receiver or transmitter in the US, but there were doubts they had the authority to issue such an order even in war time. The ban on radio was lifted in the US in late 1919.\n\nIn 1924, New York City station WHN was accused by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) of being an \"outlaw station\" for violating trade licenses which permitted only AT&T stations to sell airtime on their transmitters. As a result of the AT&T interpretation a landmark case was heard in court, which even prompted comments from Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover when he took a public stand in the station's defense. Although AT&T won its case, the furor created was such that those restrictive provisions of the transmitter license were never enforced.\n\nIn 1948, the United Nations brought into being the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which Article 19 states: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes the freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\"\n\nIn Europe, Denmark had the first known radio station in the world to broadcast commercial radio from a vessel in international waters without permission from the authorities in the country that it broadcast to (Denmark in this case). The station was named Radio Mercur and began transmission on August 2, 1958. In the Danish newspapers it was soon called a \"pirate radio\".\n\nIn the 1960s in the UK, the term referred to not only a perceived unauthorized use of the state-run spectrum by the unlicensed broadcasters but also the risk-taking nature of offshore radio stations that actually operated on anchored ships or marine platforms. The term had been used previously in Britain and the US to describe unlicensed land-based broadcasters and even border blasters (for example, a 1940 British comedy about an unauthorized TV broadcaster, \"Band Waggon\", uses the phrase \"pirate station\" several times). A good example of this kind of activity was Radio Luxembourg located in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The English language evening broadcasts from Radio Luxembourg were beamed by Luxembourg-licensed transmitters. The audience in the United Kingdom originally listened to their radio sets by permission of a wireless license issued by the British General Post Office (GPO). However, under terms of that wireless licence, it was an offence under the Wireless Telegraphy Act to listen to \"unauthorised\" broadcasts, which possibly included those transmitted by Radio Luxembourg. Therefore, as far as the British authorities were concerned, Radio Luxembourg was a \"pirate radio station\" and British listeners to the station were breaking the law (although as the term 'unauthorised' was never properly defined it was somewhat of a legal grey area). This did not stop British newspapers from printing programme schedules for the station, or a British weekly magazine aimed at teenage girls, \"Fab 208\", from promoting the DJs and their lifestyle (Radio Luxembourg's wavelength was 208 metres (1439, then 1440 kHz)).\n\nRadio Luxembourg was later joined by other well-known pirate stations received in the UK in violation of UK licensing, including Radio Caroline and Radio Atlanta (subsequently Radio Carolines North and South respectively, following their merger and the original ship's relocation) and Radio London, all of which broadcast from vessels anchored outside of territorial limits and were therefore legitimate. Radio Jackie, for instance (although transmitting illegally), was registered for VAT and even had its address and telephone number in local telephone directories.\n\nWhere actual seafaring vessels are not involved, the term \"pirate radio\" is a political term of convenience as the word \"pirate\" suggests an illegal venture, regardless of the broadcast's actual legal status. The radio station XERF located at Ciudad Acuña, Coahuila, Mexico, just across the Rio Grande from Del Rio, Texas, US, is an example.\n\nWhile Mexico issued radio station XERF with a license to broadcast, the power of its 250 kW transmitter was far greater than the maximum of 50 kW authorized for commercial use by the government of the United States of America. Consequently, XERF and many other radio stations in Mexico, which sold their broadcasting time to sponsors of English-language commercial and religious programs, were labelled as \"border blasters\", but not \"pirate radio stations\", even though the content of many of their programs could not have been aired by a US-regulated broadcaster. Predecessors to XERF, for instance, had originally broadcast in Kansas, advocating \"goat-gland surgery\" for improved masculinity, but moved to Mexico to evade US laws about advertising medical treatments, particularly unproven ones.\n\nAnother variation on the term \"pirate radio\" came about during the \"Summer of Love\" in San Francisco during the 1960s. These were \"Free radio\", which usually referred to secret and unlicensed land-based transmissions. These were also tagged as being pirate radio transmissions. Free Radio was used only to refer to radio transmissions that were beyond government control, as was offshore radio in the UK and Europe.\n\nThe term \"free radio\" was adopted by the Free Radio Association of listeners who defended the rights of the offshore \"radio stations\" broadcasting from ships and marine structures off the coastline of the United Kingdom.\n\nFélix Guattari points out:\n\nIn Europe, in addition to adopting the term \"free radio\", supportive listeners of what had been called pirate radio adopted the term offshore radio, which was usually the term used by the owners of the marine broadcasting stations.\n\nMore recently the term \"free radio\" implied that the broadcasts were commercial-free and the station was there only for the output, be it a type of music or spoken opinion. In this context, 'pirate' radio thus refers to stations that do advertise and plug various gigs and raves.\n\nSince this subject covers national territories, international waters and international airspace, the only effective way to treat this subject is on a country by country, international waters and international airspace basis. Because the laws vary, the interpretation of the term \"pirate radio\" also varies considerably.\n\nPropaganda broadcasting may be authorized by the government at the transmitting site, but may be considered unwanted or illegal by the government of the intended reception area. Propaganda broadcasting conducted by national governments against the interests of other national governments has created radio jamming stations transmitting noises on the same frequency to prevent reception of the incoming signal. While the United States transmitted its programs towards the Soviet Union, which attempted to jam them, in 1970 the government of the United Kingdom decided to employ a jamming transmitter to drown out the incoming transmissions from the commercial station Radio North Sea International, which was based aboard the motor vessel (MV) Mebo II anchored off southeast England in the North Sea. Other examples of this type of unusual broadcasting include the USCGC \"Courier\" (WAGR-410), a United States Coast Guard cutter which both originated and relayed broadcasts of the \"Voice of America\" from an anchorage at the Greek island of Rhodes to Soviet bloc countries. Balloons have been flown above Key West, Florida, to support the TV transmissions of TV Martí, which are directed at Cuba (the Cuban government jams the signals). Military broadcasting aircraft have been flown over Vietnam, Iraq, and many other nations by the United States Air Force.\n\nIllegal use of licensed radio spectrum (also known as bootlegging in CB circles) is fairly common and takes several forms.\n\n\n\nThe films \"The Boat That Rocked\", \"Pump Up the Volume\", and \"On the Air Live with Captain Midnight\", as well as the TV series \"People Just Do Nothing\" are set in the world of pirate radio, while \"Born in Flames\" features pirate radio stations as being part of an underground political movement.\n\n\n"}

It was also known initially as the Reichskommissariat Russland (Reich Commissariat of Russia). Siegfried Kasche was the projected \"Reichskomissar\", but due to the German failure to occupy the territories intended to form the \"Reichskommissariat\", it remained on paper only.\n\nNazi Germany intended to destroy Russia permanently, irrespective of whether it was capitalist, communist or tsarist. Adolf Hitler's \"Lebensraum\" policy, expressed in \"Mein Kampf\", was to dispossess the Russian inhabitants – as was to happen with other Slavs in Poland and most of Eastern Europe- and to either expel most of them beyond the Ural mountains or to exterminate them by various means. Under \"Generalplan Ost\", German colonial settlement was to be encouraged.\n\nAs the campaign against the Soviet Union advanced eastward, the occupied territories would gradually be transferred from military to civilian administration. Hitler's final decision on its administration entailed the new eastern territories being divided into four \"Reichskommissariats\" in order to destroy Russia as a geographical entity by dividing it into as many different parts as possible. These new institutions were to be under the nominal supervision of Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg as head of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories. The leaders of these provinces, the Reichskommissars, would however be direct subordinates of Hitler himself, and answerable only to him. Conquered territories of most of Russia proper were initially to become a \"Reichskommissariat Russland\" (Reich Commissariat of Russia) according to Rosenberg's plans, although this was later changed to \"Moskowien\" (Muscovy) informally also known as \"Moskau\" (Moscow). These eastern districts were thought to be the most sensitive to administer of the conquered territories. As a consequence, they would be managed from the regional capitals and directly by the German government in Berlin.\n\nThe plans were never fulfilled as the German military's plans to capture Moscow and central Russia in the Operation Typhoon failed. The transfer of conquered territories to Nazi civilian rule was therefore never completed.\n\nThe envisioned province included most of European Russia between the Ural mountains (as well as some districts east of it, including the city of Sverdlovsk) and its boundaries with Finland, the Baltic states, Belarus, and Ukraine. The Russian parts of the Caucasus region were to be controlled by a separate Reichskommissariat Kaukasus, while the rest of southern Russia was to be integrated into the Reichskommissariat Ukraine for its intended extension eastward to the border with Kazakhstan. Smaller parts that were excluded were the Pskov, Smolensk and Leningrad areas (included in the Reichskommissariat Ostland), and Eastern Karelia and the Kola peninsula, which were promised to Germany's co-belligerent Finland in 1941 for its contribution to the campaign in the east. It would therefore encompass more or less the same lands that were once under the control of the medieval state of Muscovy. Its final territory was to be bounded on the west by the Reichskommissariat Ostland and the border with Finland, on the north by the Arctic ocean, in the east by the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and in the south by the massively expanded Reichskommissariat Ukraine.\n\nThe planned administrative subdivisions of the province were largely based boundary-wise on the pre-existing Russian oblasts, and supposed to be seated in Leningrad, Gorki, Tula, Moscow, Kazan, Kirov, Molotov, and Ufa.\n\nThe administrative capital was tentatively proposed as Moscow, the historical and political center of the Russian state. As the German armies were approaching the Soviet capital in the Operation Typhoon in the autumn of 1941, Hitler determined that Moscow, like Leningrad and Kiev, would be levelled and its 4 million inhabitants killed, to destroy it as a potential center of Bolshevist resistance. For this purpose Moscow was to be covered by a large artificial lake which would permanently submerge it, by opening the sluices of the Moscow-Volga Canal. During the advance on Moscow Otto Skorzeny was tasked with capturing these dam structures.\n\nDuring a conference on 16 July 1941, Hitler stated his personal desires on the division of the eastern territories to be acquired for Germany. The Crimean peninsula, together with a large hinterland to its north encompassing much of the southern Ukraine was to be \"cleared\" of all existing foreigners and exclusively settled by Germans (as with the \"Schutzstaffel's Wehrbauer\" proposals) becoming Reich territory (part of Germany). The formerly Austrian part of Galicia was to be treated in a similar fashion. In addition the Baltic states, the \"Volga colony\" and the Baku district (as a military concession) would also have to be annexed to the Reich.\n\nAt first, the plans had assumed an eastern limit at the \"A-A line\", a notional boundary running along the Volga river between the two cities of Archangelsk and Astrakhan. Since it was expected well-ahead of the operation that the Soviet Union would in all likelihood not be totally defeated by military means despite being reduced to a rump state, aerial bombardments were to be carried out — despite the near-total lack of a strategic bomber design in the Luftwaffe's arsenal with which to perform such raids — against the remaining enemy industrial centers further to the east.\n\nRosenberg had initially proposed Erich Koch, notorious even among the Nazis as a particularly brutal leader, as Reichskommissar of the province on 7 April 1941.\n\nKoch rejected his nomination in June of that year because it was, as he described it, \"entirely negative\", and was later given control of Reichskommissariat Ukraine instead. Hitler proposed Wilhelm Kube as an alternative, but this was rejected after Hermann Göring and Rosenberg deemed him too old for the position (Kube was then in his mid-fifties), and instead assigned him to Belarus. SA-Obergruppenführer Siegfried Kasche, the German envoy in Zagreb, was selected instead. Hamburg senator and SA General promoted himself to be nominated as the Commissioner for Economic Affairs for the Moscow area. Kasche's nomination was opposed by Heinrich Himmler, who considered Kasche's SA background as being a problem and characterized him to Rosenberg as \"a man of the desk, in no wise energetic or strong, and an outspoken enemy of the SS\".\n\nErich von dem Bach-Zalewski was to become the regional Higher SS and Police Leader, and was already assigned to Army Group Centre as \"HSSPF-Russland-Mitte\" (Central Russia) for this purpose. Odilo Globocnik, then the SS and Police Leader in Lublin was to head Generalkommissariat Sverdlovsk, the easternmost district of Moskowien. Rosenberg suggested Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf as \"Hauptkommissar\" of the Yaroslavl district.\n\n\n\n"}
