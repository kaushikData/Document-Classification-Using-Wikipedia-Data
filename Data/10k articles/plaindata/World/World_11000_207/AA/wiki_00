They may also be used for technical reasons in actual reality for use in the development of specifications, such as the fictional country of \"Bookland\", which is used to allow EAN \"country\" codes 978 and 979 to be used for ISBN numbers assigned to books, and code 977 to be assigned for use for ISSN numbers on magazines and other periodicals. Also, the ISO 3166 country code \"ZZ\" is reserved as a fictional country code.\n\nFictional countries appear commonly in stories of early science fiction (or scientific romance). Such countries supposedly form part of the normal Earth landscape although not located in a normal atlas. Later similar tales often took place on fictional planets.\n\nJonathan Swift's protagonist, Lemuel Gulliver, visited various strange places. Edgar Rice Burroughs placed adventures of Tarzan in areas in Africa that, at the time, remained mostly unknown to the West and to the East. Isolated islands with strange creatures and/or customs enjoyed great popularity in these authors' times. By the 19th century, when Western explorers had surveyed most of the Earth's surface, this option was lost to Western culture. Thereafter fictional utopian and dystopian societies tended to spring up on other planets or in space, whether in human colonies or in alien societies originating elsewhere. Fictional countries can also be used in stories set in a distant future, with other political borders than today.\n\nSuperhero and secret agent comics and some thrillers also use fictional countries on Earth as backdrops. Most of these countries exist only for a single story, a TV-series episode or an issue of a comic book. There are notable exceptions, such as Qumar and Equatorial Kundu in \"The West Wing\", Marvel Comics Latveria and DC Comics Qurac and Bialya.\n\nFictional countries often deliberately resemble or even represent some real-world country or present a utopia or dystopia for commentary. Variants of the country's name sometimes make it clear what country they really have in mind. By using a fictional country instead of a real one, authors can exercise greater freedom in creating characters, events, and settings, while at the same time presenting a vaguely familiar locale that readers can recognize. A fictional country leaves the author unburdened by the restraints of a real nation's actual history, politics, and culture, and can thus allow for greater scope in plot construction and be exempt from criticism for vilifying an actual nation, political party, or people. The fictional \"Tomania\" (a parody of Nazi Germany named after ptomaine) serves as a setting for Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator and skewers a régime infamous for religious bigotry, militarism, racism, diplomatic bullying, and violations of civil liberties.\n\nFictional countries are also invented for the purpose of military training scenarios, e.g. the group of islands around Hawaii were assigned the names \"Blueland\" and \"Orangeland\" in the international maritime exercise, RIMPAC 98.\n\nFictional countries have been created for polling purposes. When polled in April 2004, 8% of British people believed that the [fictional] country of Luvania would soon join the European Union. In the 1989 General Social Survey, U.S. respondents were asked to rate the social status of people of \"Wisian\" background, a fictional national heritage. While a majority of respondents said they could not place the Wisians in the U.S. social hierarchy, those who did ranked their status as quite low, giving an average of 4.12 on a 9-point scale, where 9 was the highest social standing. \"Once you let the Wisians in, the neighborhood goes to pot,\" quipped \"Time Magazine\".\n\nCountries from stories, myths, legends, that some believe to exist, or to have existed at some point:\n\n\n"}

Only one satellite of the Block IIA (SVN-34) is still in service, broadcasting the PRN 18 signal.\n\nTwo of the satellites in this series, numbers 35 and 36, are equipped with laser retro-reflectors, allowing them to be tracked independently of their radio signals, providing unambiguous separation of clock and ephemeris errors.\n\nThe Block IIR series are \"replenishment\" (replacement) satellites developed by Lockheed Martin. Each satellite weighs at launch and once on orbit. The first attempted launch of a Block IIR satellite failed on January 17, 1997 when the Delta II rocket exploded 12 seconds into flight. The first successful launch was on July 23, 1997. Twelve satellites in the series were successfully launched.\nAt least ten satellites in this block carried an experimental S-band payload for search and rescue, known as Distress Alerting Satellite System.\n\nThe Block IIR-M satellites include a new military signal and a more robust civil signal, known as L2C.\n\nThe Block IIF series are \"follow-on\" satellites developed by Boeing. The satellite has a mass of 1,630 kilograms (3,600 lb) and a design life of 12 years. The first Block IIF space vehicle was launched in May 2010 on a Delta IV rocket. The twelfth and final IIF launch was February 5, 2016.\n\nGPS Block IIIA is the first series of third-generation GPS satellites, incorporating new signals and broadcasting at higher power levels. In September 2016, the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin a contract option for two more Block IIIA satellites, setting the total number of GPS IIIA satellites to ten. As of August 2018, the first GPS IIIA launch is scheduled for December 2018 by SpaceX.\n\nThe Block IIIF series (or \"tranche\") is the second set of GPS Block III satellites, which will consist of up to 22 space vehicles. Block IIIF launches are expected to begin no earlier than 2025 and continue through 2034.\n"}

(1992) is a short documentary directed by Johan Grimonprez that deals with the history of a remote village in the highlands of New Guinea. The videotape assembles archival footage and oral histories depicting the first encounter between the Irian Jaya people and the scientific crew, including anthropologists, of the Dutch Star Mountains Expedition. The confrontation with the crew and their helictopter caused a shock that threw the worldview of the villagers upside down.\n\nThe event even entered their Sibil-tongue language; literally translated, weng means language, whilst kobar airplane. \"Kobarweng's\" title is an ironic reference to a question first posed to Grimonprez by a local man named Kaiang Tapor, who, upon Grimonprez's arrival in the village of Pepera after a three-day hike, asked him where his helicopter was. The footage in the film is traversed by a running band of script, reporting observations and remarks culled from anthropologists' interviews, eye-witness reports, and the reminiscences of those highlanders who recall those moments of 'first contact' between the white intruders (missionaries, prospectors, anthropologists, adventurers) and the local inhabitants: \"We never tell everything, we always keep something for the next anthropologist\" they are candid enough to admit to Margaret Mead, while another wit remarks: \"We called the whites 'people of soap', but their shit smelled the same as ours.\"\n\nSwitching the roles of observer and observed, the relation implied in the anthropological representation is reversed: the desire of the observing anthropologist itself becomes “other”, “exotic”, an object of curiosity destabilised by the villager’s questions. According to Grimonprez: \"\"Kobarweng\" critically considers the myth of objectivity, the pretence of an epistemic and scientific detachment maintained not just by the anthropologist, but throughout the discourse of western science, where the observer finds himself caught in an alienated position of transcendence over his/her subject.\"\n\nIn 1994, Grimonprez showcased a five-channel installation entitled \"It Will Be All Right If You Come Again, Only Next Time Don't Bring Any Gear, Except a Tea Kettle...\", which expanded upon the themes of \"Kobarweng\". The encounter between the different groups in 1939 up to the current problems caused by neocolonialism.\n\nPapua New Guinea is one of the most heterogeneous countries in the world and has long been a favorite among anthropologists, with its more than 7000 years of agriculture, its hundreds of tribes and languages, some of whom have still not been \"discovered\". Beside a cultural-rich area, West Papua is also an area with considerable reserves of gold, copper, uranium, nickel, oil and natural gas which causes environmental degradation and ongoing series of human abuses.\nThe whole province is occupied by the Indonesian military and an estimated 100.000 people have died in West Papua since Indonesia took control. According to a Yale university law school report \"there can be little doubt that the Indonesian government has engaged in a systematic pattern of acts that has resulted in harm to a substantial part of the indigenous population of West Papua.\" Amnesty International found that there were no effective means for people of the public could complain against the police acting in violation of international law and standards.\n\nThe film was acquired by the museum collections housed at the Musée National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou; the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, and Tate Modern.\nThe film was awarded the Grand Prix de VIlle de Genève - First Price at the SIV Video Biennale Saint-Gervais Genève in 1993; the First prize for the best international video creation at the Cadiz International Video Festival 1994; as well as winner for the category 'experimental documentary' at the Baltimore Film forum 1992.\n\nJohan Grimonprez is a Belgian multimedia artist, filmmaker, and curator. He is well known for his films dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y (1997) and Double Take (2009). As of 2014, Grimonprez's upcoming projects include the feature films How to Rewind Your Dog (2014) and Shadow World: Inside the Global Arms Trade (2015), based on the book by Andrew Feinstein and was awarded a production grant from the Sundance Institute. In 2011 Hatje Cantz published a reader on his work titled Johan Grimonprez: \"It's a Poor Sort of Memory that Only Works Backwards\", with contributions by Jodi Dean, Thomas Elsaesser, Tom McCarthy (novelist), Hans Ulrich Obrist, and Slavoj Žižek.

The landscape is composed of many of the normal elements you would find in any natural realm. There is a main body of land, where most of the story takes place, as well as a few outlying islands. Midcyru is split into several small countries each with its own unique peoples, religions, magics and so on..\n\nCenaria is a kingdom in western Midcyru. Its capital is Cenaria City, which is most well known for its powerful Sa'kagé underworld. Aided by Talented assassins called wetboys, the Cenarian Sa'kagé controls all of the city's illicit trades (smuggling, prostitution, extortion etc.) and plays a notable role in the kingdom's political life, wielding more power than the king himself. By the time of the events described in the books Cenaria has little to no political or military power, being considered by its neighbours to be corrupt and weak. Eastern Cenaria has been occupied by the Lae'knaught Order for a long time.\nCenarians who show Talent can either apprentice as wetboys to become skilled killers for hire or apply to a mage's school in another country.\nMost of the trilogy's storyline takes place in this country.\n\nA kingdom in central Midcyru ruled by queens from the city of Caernarvon, a center of trade and craftsmanship.\n\nKhalidor is located in northern Midcyru and ruled by a line of tyrannical Godkings. Its population has been corrupted by the false goddess Khali, who feeds on human suffering. Khalidoran mages (called meisters and Vürdmeisters) use the unnatural vir, powered by a reservoir of magic that is collected from the life energy - or glore vyrden - of everyone who \"prays\" to Khali. Some Khalidoran Vürdmeisters also know the secrets of raising undead creatures known as krul and every variation thereof.\n\nOssein is Cenaria's eastern neighbor. The Chantry, a school for female magae, is situated in Ossein.\n\nA large country in southern Midcyru. The Sho'Fasti mages' school is located there. By the time of the trilogy's story, Alitaera had the most powerful army in Midcyru. The names and titles of Alitaera resemble those of Ancient Rome.\n\n'Ceura' means 'sword' in the natives' tongue. The sa'ceurai are among the most skilled swordsmen in Midcyru, surpassing even Khalidoran Highlanders. The Ceurans have a very strict code of honor and show great respect for skillful and honorable fighters. According to their beliefs, a man's sword is his soul.\nWhile officially a kingdom, Ceura has long been under the rule of Regents. Lantano Garuwashi has been proclaimed King after retrieving Ceur'caelestos, the Blade of Heaven, and Ceura has also acknowledged the rule of the High King.\nSome of the Ceuran names sound Japanese, and the code of honor (including a harakiri-like suicide ritual) resembles the ways of the samurai. Its capital city is Aenu.\n\nA country in eastern Midcyru bordering Alitaera and Ymmur. Friaki are fierce warriors divided into clans which are led by goranthi - Talented warriors who go into battle half-naked and seem to resemble berserkers.\n\nA country in northern Midcyru which has been occupied by Khalidor. Khalidorans and Lodricari dislike each other, but the Lodricari learned to use the vir and make up parts of the Khalidoran Godkings' army. Vürdmeister Neph Dada was a Lodricari.\n\nA country in south-western Midcyru. The mages' school of Sho'Cendi is located there. Its capital city is Gan. It can be thought of as the loose fictional counterpart to India/the Middle East.\n\nTerritories in northern Midcyru populated by barbarian tribes. It is a mystical place- Kylar hears about many mythological creatures that apparently roam the Freeze.\n\nYmmur is the name of a country or territory in eastern Midcyru covered by steppes and populated by a nomadic people. They are famous for their mounted archers armed with amazingly powerful Ymmuri shortbows.\nTalented Ymmuri can become stalkers, hunters/killers akin to Cenarian wetboys. Unlike wetboys, however, stalkers kill for a cause rather than for money. The way their people are described is similar to the likeness of the people of Mongolia.\n\nThe Sethi come from an archipelago to the west of Midcyru. Their capital is the city of Hokkai. Seth is famous for its wine and for its sailors. Although still called an empire, Seth has lost all of its colonies over time. Sethi can be thought of as the loose fictional counterpart of Greece.\n\nAn island-state to the south of Midcyru famous for its healers.\n\nPlanga is a small island-state near the western shore of Ceura and Modai.\n\nLadesh is a large continent/country to the south-west of Midcyru.It is so large that even a Ladeshian duke can hold an estate the size of Cenaria. It holds a monopoly for silk production. The Ladeshian system of titles is based on merit rather than inherited.\n\nA garrison in the mountains separating Cenaria from Khalidor. Screaming Winds consists of three sets of walls that stretch across the only pass large enough to accommodate an army. Screaming Winds fell when the Khalidorians carrying Khali to Cenaria attacked the pass. The only person to survive the attack was Solon Tofusin.\n\nA location in Cenaria close to the Ceuran border. The decisive battle between Cenarian rebels and the Khalidoran invaders takes place there.\n\nTrayethell was a great city once, but it was devastated and sealed by mighty spells by Jorsin Alkestes when he defended it against Roygaris Ursuul's hordes of undead. For seven centuries the place has been known as Black Barrow and was barren along with most of eastern Khalidor.\nAfter laying hands on Iures, the Staff of Law, Neph Dada managed to break the spells which were woven over Black Barrow (one to prevent the use of vir, one to prevent the re-raising of krul and one to hold a trapped Titan inside). After Neph and Khali were defeated, Trayethell was restored to its former beauty. High King Logan renamed it Elenea in honor of Elene Cromwyll and made it his capital.\n\nResidence of the Dark Hunter. Every living creature to enter the Wood has been killed by the Dark Hunter, with the exception of Kylar Stern and Durzo Blint, who briefly recovered Curoch from the Wood, and Feir Cousat, who enters attempting to retrieve Curoch (as Ceur'Caelestos, although he only obtains a hilt)\n\nSchool for magae (female mages) in Ossein and headquarters of the Sisterhood.\n\nLocation of the Great Citadel built by the Khalidoran Godkings.\n\nThe location of the Blue Ka'kari.

{"id": "131855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=131855", "title": "Polis", "text": "Polis\n\nPolis (; ), plural poleis (, ), literally means city in Greek. It can also mean a body of citizens. In modern historiography, \"polis\" is normally used to indicate the ancient Greek city-states, like Classical Athens and its contemporaries, and thus is often translated as \"city-state\". These cities consisted of a fortified city centre built on an acropolis or harbor and controlled surrounding territories of land (\"khôra\").\n\nThe Ancient Greek city-state developed during the Archaic period as the ancestor of city, state, and citizenship and persisted (though with decreasing influence) well into Roman times, when the equivalent Latin word was \"civitas\", also meaning \"citizenhood\", while \"municipium\" applied to a non-sovereign local entity. The term \"city-state\", which originated in English (alongside the German \"Stadtstaat\"), does not fully translate the Greek term. The \"poleis\" were not like other primordial ancient city-states like Tyre or Sidon, which were ruled by a king or a small oligarchy, but rather political entities ruled by their bodies of citizens. The traditional view of archaeologists—that the appearance of urbanization at excavation sites could be read as a sufficient index for the development of a \"polis—\"was criticised by François Polignac in 1984 and has not been taken for granted in recent decades: the \"polis\" of Sparta, for example, was established in a network of villages. The term \"polis\", which in archaic Greece meant \"city\", changed with the development of the governance center in the city to signify \"state\" (which included its surrounding villages). Finally, with the emergence of a notion of citizenship among landowners, it came to describe the entire body of citizens. The ancient Greeks did not always refer to Athens, Sparta, Thebes, and other \"poleis\" as such; they often spoke instead of the Athenians, Lacedaemonians, Thebans and so on. The body of citizens came to be the most important meaning of the term \"polis\" in ancient Greece.\n\nThe Greek term that specifically meant the totality of \"urban\" buildings and spaces is \"asty\" ().\n\nPlato analyzes the \"polis\" in \"The Republic\", whose Greek title, Πολιτεία (Politeia), itself derives from the word \"polis\". The best form of government of the \"polis\" for Plato is the one that leads to the common good. The philosopher king is the best ruler because, as a philosopher, he is acquainted with the Form of the Good. In Plato's analogy of the ship of state, the philosopher king steers the \"polis\", as if it were a ship, in the best direction.\n\nBooks II–IV of \"The Republic\" are concerned with Plato addressing the makeup of an ideal \"polis\". In \"The Republic\", Socrates is concerned with the two underlying principles of any society: mutual needs and differences in aptitude. Starting from these two principles, Socrates deals with the economic structure of an ideal \"polis\". According to Plato, there are five main economic classes of any \"polis\": producers, merchants, sailors/shipowners, retail traders, and wage earners. Along with the two principles and five economic classes, there are four virtues. The four virtues of a \"just city\" include, wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice. With all of these principles, classes, and virtues, it was believed that a \"just city\" (\"polis\") would exist.\n\nThe basic and indicating elements of a \"polis \"are:\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period, which marks the decline of the classical \"polis\", the following cities remained independent: Sparta until 195 BC after the War against Nabis. Achaean League is the last example of original Greek city-state federations (dissolved after the Battle of Corinth (146 BC)). The Cretan city-states continued to be independent (except Itanus and Arsinoe, which lay under Ptolemaic influence) until the conquest of Crete in 69 BC by Rome. The cities of Magna Graecia, with the notable examples of Syracuse and Tarentum, were conquered by Rome in the late 3rd century BC. There are also some cities with recurring independence like Samos, Priene, Miletus, and Athens. A remarkable example of a city-state that flourished during this era is Rhodes, through its merchant navy, until 43 BC and the Roman conquest.\n\nThe Hellenistic colonies and cities of the era retain some basic characteristics of a \"polis\", except the status of independence (city-state) and the political life. There is self-governance (like the new Macedonian title politarch), but under a ruler and king. The political life of the classical era was transformed into an individualized religious and philosophical view of life (see Hellenistic philosophy and religion). Demographic decline forced the cities to abolish the status of metic and bestow citizenship; in 228 BC, Miletus enfranchised over 1,000 Cretans. Dyme sold its citizenship for one talent, payable in two installments. The foreign residents in a city are now called paroikoi. In an age when most political establishments in Asia are kingdoms, the Chrysaorian League in Caria was a Hellenistic federation of \"poleis\".\n\nDuring the Roman era, some cities were granted the status of a \"polis\", or free city, self-governed under the Roman Empire. The last institution commemorating the old Greek \"poleis\" was the Panhellenion, established by Hadrian.\n\nDerivatives of \"polis\" are common in many modern European languages. This is indicative of the influence of the \"polis\"-centred Hellenic world view. Derivative words in English include policy, polity, police, and politics. In Greek, words deriving from \"polis\" include \"politēs\" and \"politismos\", whose exact equivalents in Latin, Romance, and other European languages, respectively \"civis\" (\"citizen\"), \"civilisatio\" (\"civilization\"), etc., are similarly derived.\n\nA number of words end in \"-polis\". Most refer to a special kind of city or state. Examples include:\n\nOthers refer to part of a city or a group of cities, such as:\n\nLocated on the northwest coast of Cyprus is the town of Polis, or Polis Chrysochous (), situated within the Paphos District and on the edge of the Akamas peninsula. During the Cypro-Classical period, Polis became one of the most important ancient Cypriot city-kingdoms on the island, with important commercial relations with the eastern Aegean Islands, Attica, and Corinth. The town is also well known due to its mythological history, including the site of the Baths of Aphrodite.\n\nThe names of several other towns and cities in Europe and the Middle East have contained the suffix \"-polis\" since antiquity or currently feature modernized spellings, such as \"-pol\". Notable examples include:\n\nThe names of other cities were also given the suffix \"-polis\" after antiquity, either referring to ancient names or unrelated:\n\nSome cities have also been given nicknames ending with the suffix \"-polis\", usually referring to their characteristics:\nCardiff, Wales, UK, once dubbed \"Terracottaopolis\" due to its fame for buildings faced in terracotta, local red brickwork and ceramics.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23564616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23564616", "title": "Republic of Macedonia", "text": "Republic of Macedonia\n\nMacedonia (; ), officially the Republic of Macedonia ( ), is a country in the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. It is one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia, from which it declared independence in 1991.\n\nThe country became a member of the United Nations in 1993, but, as a result of an ongoing dispute with Greece over the use of the name \"Macedonia\", was admitted under the provisional description the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (sometimes abbreviated as FYROM and FYR Macedonia), a term that is also used by international organizations such as the European Union, the Council of Europe, and NATO.\n\nOn 17 June 2018, Macedonia and Greece signed the Prespa agreement which would see the country change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, pending approval from parliament. A 30 September non-binding national referendum on the matter passed with 90% approval, although it did not reach the required 50% turnout, leaving the final decision with parliament to ratify the result. On 19 October 2018, parliament approved of the name change with the required two-thirds majority needed to enact constitutional changes being reached. The government have now begun the procedure of completing the constitutional change needed to change the country's name, which is expected to be completed by January at the latest.\n\nA landlocked country, the Republic of Macedonia has borders with Kosovo to the northwest, Serbia to the north, Bulgaria to the east, Greece to the south, and Albania to the west. It constitutes approximately the northwestern third of the larger geographical region of Macedonia, which also comprises the neighbouring parts of northern Greece and smaller portions of southwestern Bulgaria and southeastern Albania. The country's geography is defined primarily by mountains, valleys, and rivers. The capital and largest city, Skopje, is home to roughly a quarter of the nation's 2.06 million inhabitants. The majority of the residents are ethnic Macedonians, a South Slavic people. Albanians form a significant minority at around 25 percent, followed by Turks, Romani, Serbs, Bosniaks, Aromanians and others.\n\nThis region's history dates back to antiquity, beginning with the kingdom of Paeonia, probably a mixed Thraco-Illyrian polity. In the late sixth century BC, the area was incorporated into the Persian Achaemenid Empire, then annexed by the Kingdom of Macedonia in the fourth century BC. The Romans conquered the region in the second century BC and made it part of the much larger province of Macedonia. Τhe area remained part of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, and was often raided and settled by Slavic tribes beginning in the sixth century of the Christian era. Following centuries of contention between the Bulgarian, Byzantine and Serbian empires, it gradually came under Ottoman dominion from the 14th until the early 20th century, when following the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913, the modern territory of Macedonia came under Serbian rule. In the aftermath of the First World War (1914–1918), it became incorporated into the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which after the Second World War was re-established as a republic (1945) and which became the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1963. Macedonia remained a constituent socialist republic within Yugoslavia until its peaceful secession in 1991.\n\nThe sovereign state of Macedonia is a parliamentary republic and member of the UN and of the Council of Europe. Since 2005 it has also been a candidate for joining the European Union and has applied for NATO membership. Although one of the poorest countries in Europe, Macedonia has made significant progress in developing an open, market-based economy.\n\nThe state's name derives from the Greek (\"Makedonía\"), a kingdom (later, region) named after the ancient Macedonians. Their name, (\"Makedónes\"), derives ultimately from the ancient Greek adjective μακεδνός (\"makednós\"), 'tall' or 'taper', which shares the same root as the adjective (\"makrós\"), 'long', 'tall', or 'high', in ancient Greek. The name is originally believed to have meant either 'highlanders' or 'the tall ones', possibly descriptive of the people. However, according to linguist Robert S. P. Beekes, both terms are of Pre-Greek substrate origin and cannot be explained in terms of Indo-European morphology.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia geographically roughly corresponds to the ancient kingdom of Paeonia, which was located immediately north of the ancient Kingdom of Macedonia. Paeonia was inhabited by the Paeonians, a Thracian people, whilst the northwest was inhabited by the Dardani and the southwest by tribes known historically as the Enchelae, Pelagones and Lyncestae; the latter two are generally regarded as Molossian tribes of the northwestern Greek group, whilst the former two are considered Illyrian.\n\nIn the late 6th century BC, the Achaemenid Persians under Darius the Great conquered the Paeonians, incorporating what is today the Republic of Macedonia within their vast territories. Following the loss in the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 479 BC, the Persians eventually withdrew from their European territories, including from what is today the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nIn 356 BC Philip II of Macedon absorbed the regions of Upper Macedonia (Lynkestis and Pelagonia) and the southern part of Paeonia (Deuriopus) into the kingdom of Macedon. Philip's son Alexander the Great conquered the remainder of the region, and incorporated it in his empire, reaching as far north as Scupi, but the city and the surrounding area remained part of Dardania.\n\nThe Romans established the Province of Macedonia in 146 BC. By the time of Diocletian, the province had been subdivided between \"Macedonia Prima\" (\"first Macedonia\") on the south, encompassing most of the kingdom of Macedon, and \"Macedonia Salutaris\" (known also as \"Macedonia Secunda\", \"second Macedonia\") on the north, encompassing partially Dardania and the whole of Paeonia; most of the country's modern boundaries fell within the latter, with the city of Stobi as its capital. Roman expansion brought the Scupi area under Roman rule in the time of Domitian (81–96 AD), and it fell within the Province of Moesia. Whilst Greek remained the dominant language in the eastern part of the Roman empire, Latin spread to some extent in Macedonia.\n\nSlavic tribes settled in the Balkan region including Macedonia by the late 6th century AD. During the 580s, Byzantine literature attests to the Slavs raiding Byzantine territories in the region of Macedonia, later aided by Bulgars. Historical records document that in c. 680 a group of Bulgars, Slavs and Byzantines led by a Bulgar called Kuber settled in the region of the Keramisian plain, centred on the city of Bitola. Presian's reign apparently coincides with the extension of Bulgarian control over the Slavic tribes in and around Macedonia. The Slavic tribes that settled in the region of Macedonia converted to Christianity around the 9th century during the reign of Tsar Boris I of Bulgaria.\n\nIn 1014, the Byzantine Emperor Basil II defeated the armies of Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria, and within four years the Byzantines restored control over the Balkans (including Macedonia) for the first time since the 7th century. However, by the late 12th century, Byzantine decline saw the region contested by various political entities, including a brief Norman occupation in the 1080s.\n\nIn the early 13th century, a revived Bulgarian Empire gained control of the region. Plagued by political difficulties, the empire did not last, and the region came once again under Byzantine control in the early 14th century. In the 14th century, it became part of the Serbian Empire, who saw themselves as liberators of their Slavic kin from Byzantine despotism. Skopje became the capital of Tsar Stefan Dusan's empire.\n\nFollowing Dusan's death, a weak successor appeared, and power struggles between nobles divided the Balkans once again. These events coincided with the entry of the Ottoman Turks into Europe. The Kingdom of Prilep was one of the short-lived states that emerged from the collapse of the Serbian Empire in the 14th century. Gradually, all of the central Balkans were conquered by the Ottoman Empire and remained under its domination for five centuries as part of the province or Eyalet of Rumelia. The name \"Rumelia\" (Turkish: \"Rumeli\") means \"Land of the Romans\" in Turkish, referring to the lands conquered by the Ottoman Turks from the Byzantine Empire.). Over the centuries Rumelia Eyalet was reduced in size through administrative reforms, until by the nineteenth century it consisted of a region of central Albania and north-western Macedonia with its capital at Manastir or present day Bitola. Rumelia Eyalet was abolished in 1867 and the territory of Macedonia subsequently became part of the province of Manastir Vilayet until the end of Ottoman rule in 1912.\n\nWith the beginning of the Bulgarian National Revival in the 18th century, many of the reformers were from this region, including the Miladinov Brothers, Rajko Žinzifov, Joakim Krčovski, Kiril Pejčinoviḱ and others. The bishoprics of Skopje, Debar, Bitola, Ohrid, Veles and Strumica voted to join the Bulgarian Exarchate after it was established in 1870.\n\nSeveral movements whose goals were the establishment of an autonomous Macedonia, which would encompass the entire region of Macedonia, began to arise in the late 19th century; the earliest of these was the Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, later becoming Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (SMARO). In 1905 it was renamed the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO), and after World War I the organisation separated into the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation (ITRO).\n\nIn the early years of the organisation, membership eligibility was exclusive to Bulgarians, but later it was extended to all inhabitants of European Turkey regardless of ethnicity or religion. The majority of its members, however, were Macedonian Bulgarians. In 1903, IMRO organised the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottomans, which after some initial successes, including the forming of the Kruševo Republic, was crushed with much loss of life. The uprising and the forming of the Kruševo Republic are considered the cornerstone and precursors to the eventual establishment of the Macedonian state.\nFollowing the two Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, most of its European-held territories were divided between Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia. The territory of the modern Macedonian state was annexed by Serbia and named \"South Serbia\". Following the partition, an anti-Bulgarian campaign was carried out in the areas under Serbian and Greek control. As many as 641 Bulgarian schools and 761 churches were closed by the Serbs, while Exarchist clergy and teachers were expelled. The use of standard Bulgarian (including all Macedonian dialects) were proscribed.\n\nIn the fall of 1915, Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in the First World War and gained control over most of the territory of the present-day Republic of Macedonia. After the end of the First World War, the area returned to Serbian control as part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and saw a reintroduction of the anti-Bulgarian measures of the first occupation (1913–1915): Bulgarian teachers and clergy were expelled, Bulgarian language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian organisations dissolved.\n\nThe Serbian government pursued a policy of forced Serbianisation in the region, which included systematic repression of Bulgarian activists, altering family surnames, internal colonisation, forced labor, and intense propaganda. To aid the implementation of this policy, some 50,000 Serbian army and gendermerie were stationed in Macedonia. By 1940 about 280 Serbian colonies (comprising 4,200 families) were established as part of the government's internal colonisation program (initial plans envisaged 50,000 families settling in Macedonia).\n\nIn 1929, the Kingdom was officially renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and divided into provinces called \"banovinas\". Southern Serbia, including all of what is now the Republic of Macedonia, became the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe concept of a United Macedonia was used by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) in the interbellum. Its leaders – including Todor Alexandrov, Aleksandar Protogerov, and Ivan Mihailov – promoted independence of the Macedonian territory split between Serbia and Greece for the whole population, regardless of religion and ethnicity. The Bulgarian government of Alexander Malinov in 1918 offered to give Pirin Macedonia for that purpose after World War I, but the Great Powers did not adopt this idea because Serbia and Greece opposed it. In 1924, the Communist International suggested that all Balkan communist parties adopt a platform of a \"united Macedonia\" but the suggestion was rejected by the Bulgarian and Greek communists.\n\nIMRO followed by starting an insurgent war in Vardar Banovina, together with Macedonian Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization, which also conducted guerilla attacks against the Serbian administrative and army officials there. In 1923 in Stip, a paramilitary organisation called Association against Bulgarian Bandits was formed by Serbian chetniks, IMRO renegades and Macedonian Federative Organization (MFO) members to oppose IMRO and MMTRO.\n\nThe Macedonist ideas increased during the interbellum, in Yugoslav Vardar Macedonia, and among the left diaspora in Bulgaria, and were supported by the Comintern. In 1934, it issued a special resolution in which for the first time directions were provided for recognizing the existence of a separate Macedonian nation and Macedonian language.\n\nDuring World War II, Yugoslavia was occupied by the Axis powers from 1941 to 1945. The Vardar Banovina was divided between Bulgaria and Italian-occupied Albania. Bulgarian Action Committees were established to prepare the region for the new Bulgarian administration and army. The Committees were mostly formed by former members of IMRO, but some communists such as Panko Brashnarov, Strahil Gigov and Metodi Shatorov also participated.\n\nAs leader of the Vardar Macedonian communists, Shatorov switched from the Yugoslav Communist Party to the Bulgarian Communist Party and refused to start military action against the Bulgarian Army.\nThe Bulgarian authorities, under German pressure, were responsible for the round-up and deportation of over 7,000 Jews in Skopje and Bitola. Harsh rule by the occupying forces encouraged many Vardar Macedonians to support the Communist Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito after 1943, and the National Liberation War ensued, with German forces being driven out of Yugoslav Macedonia by the end of 1944.\n\nIn Vardar Macedonia, after the Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944, the Bulgarian troops, surrounded by German forces, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. Under the leadership of the new Bulgarian pro-Soviet government, four armies, 455,000 strong in total, were mobilised and reorganised. Most of them re-entered occupied Yugoslavia in early October 1944 and moved from Sofia to Niš, Skopje and Pristina with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Kingdom of Greece|Greece. Compelled by the Soviet Union with a view towards the creation of a large South Slav Federation, the Bulgarian government once again offered to give Pirin Macedonia to such a United Macedonia in 1945.\nIn 1944 the Anti-Fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) proclaimed the People's Republic of Macedonia as part of the \"People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\". ASNOM remained an acting government until the end of the war. The Macedonian alphabet was codified by linguists of ASNOM, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić and the principles of Krste Petkov Misirkov.\n\nThe new republic became one of the six republics of the Yugoslav federation. Following the federation's renaming as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1963, the People's Republic of Macedonia was likewise renamed the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. During the civil war in Greece (1946–1949), Macedonian communist insurgents supported the Greek communists. Many refugees fled to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia from there. The state dropped \"Socialist\" from its name in 1991 when it peacefully seceded from Yugoslavia.\n\nThe country officially celebrates 8 September 1991 as Independence day (, \"Den na nezavisnosta\"), with regard to the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia, albeit legalising participation in future union of the former states of Yugoslavia. The anniversary of the start of the Ilinden Uprising (St. Elijah's Day) on 2 August is also widely celebrated on an official level as the Day of the Republic.\n\nRobert Badinter, as the head of the Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia, recommended EC recognition in January 1992.\n\nMacedonia remained at peace through the Yugoslav Wars of the early 1990s. A few very minor changes to its border with Yugoslavia were agreed upon to resolve problems with the demarcation line between the two countries. However, it was seriously destabilised by the Kosovo War in 1999, when an estimated 360,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo took refuge in the country. Although they departed shortly after the war, Albanian nationalists on both sides of the border took up arms soon after in pursuit of autonomy or independence for the Albanian-populated areas of Macedonia.\nA conflict took place between the government and ethnic Albanian insurgents, mostly in the north and west of the country, between February and August 2001. The war ended with the intervention of a NATO ceasefire monitoring force. Under the terms of the Ohrid Agreement, the government agreed to devolve greater political power and cultural recognition to the Albanian minority. The Albanian side agreed to abandon separatist demands and to recognise all Macedonian institutions fully. In addition, according to this accord, the NLA were to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force.\nInter-ethnic tensions flared in Macedonia in 2012, with incidents of violence between ethnic Albanians and Macedonians.\n\nThe Prespa Agreement, which replaces the Interim Accord of 1995, was signed on 17 June 2018 in a high-level ceremony at the Greek border village of Psarades on Lake Prespa, by the two foreign ministers Nikola Dimitrov and Nikos Kotzias and in the presence of the respective prime ministers, Zoran Zaev and Alexis Tsipras. The meeting was attended by the UN's Special Representative Matthew Nimetz, the U.S. Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, the EU's High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, and the European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy Johannes Hahn, among others. After the ceremony, Tsipras, along with his Macedonian counterpart, crossed over the border to the Macedonian side of Lake Prespa for lunch at the village of Oteševo, in a highly symbolic move that marked the first time a Greek Prime Minister ever entered the Republic of Macedonia since it declared independence in 1991.\n\nThe withdrawal of the Greek veto resulted in the European Union on June 27 approving the start of accession talks with the Republic of Macedonia, which are expected to take place in 2019, under the condition that the Prespa deal is implemented and Macedonia's constitutional name is changed to \"Republic of North Macedonia\". On July 5, the Prespa agreement was ratified again by the Macedonian parliament with 69 MPs voting in favor of it. On July 11, NATO invited Macedonia to start accession talks in a bid to become the EuroAtlantic alliance’s 30th member. On July 30, the parliament of Macedonia approved plans to hold a non-binding referendum on changing the country's name that took place on September 30. 91% of voters voted in favour with a 37% turnout, but the referendum was not carried because of a constitutional requirement for a 50% turnout. The government intended to push forward with the name change.\n\nOn October 15, the parliament of Macedonia began debating the name change. The proposal for the constitutional reform requires the vote of 80 MPs, i.e. two-thirds of the 120-seat parliament.\n\nOn 16 October, US Assistant Secretary of State Wess Mitchell sent a letter to VMRO-DPMNE leader Hristijan Mickoski, in which he expresses the disappointment of the United States with the positions of the leadership, including him personally, and asks to \"set aside partisan interests\" and work to get the name change approved. Mickoski expressed his hope that the Republic of Macedonia will be very soon a part of the NATO and EU families, \"but proud and dignified, not humiliated, disfigured and disgraced.\"\n\nOn 19 October the parliament voted to start the process of renaming the country after a total of 80 MPs voted in favour of the constitutional changes.\n\nMacedonia has a total area of . It lies between latitudes 40° and 43° N, and mostly between longitudes 20° and 23° E (a small area lies east of 23°). Macedonia has some of boundaries, shared with Serbia () to the North, Kosovo () to the northwest, Bulgaria () to the east, Greece () to the south, and Albania () to the west. It is a transit way for shipment of goods from Greece, through the Balkans, towards Eastern, Western and Central Europe and through Bulgaria to the east. It is part of a larger region also known as Macedonia, which also includes Macedonia (Greece) and the Blagoevgrad Province in southwestern Bulgaria.\nMacedonia is a landlocked country that is geographically clearly defined by a central valley formed by the Vardar river and framed along its borders by mountain ranges. The terrain is mostly rugged, located between the Šar Mountains and Osogovo, which frame the valley of the Vardar river. Three large lakes – Lake Ohrid, Lake Prespa and Dojran Lake – lie on the southern borders, bisected by the frontiers with Albania and Greece. Ohrid is considered to be one of the oldest lakes and biotopes in the world. The region is seismically active and has been the site of destructive earthquakes in the past, most recently in 1963 when Skopje was heavily damaged by a major earthquake, killing over 1,000.\n\nMacedonia also has scenic mountains. They belong to two different mountain ranges: the first is the Šar Mountains that continues to the West Vardar/Pelagonia group of mountains (Baba Mountain, Nidže, Kozuf and Jakupica), also known as the Dinaric range. The second range is the Osogovo–Belasica mountain chain, also known as the Rhodope range. The mountains belonging to the Šar Mountains and the West Vardar/Pelagonia range are younger and higher than the older mountains of the Osogovo-Belasica mountain group. Mount Korab of the Šar Mountains on the Albanian border, at 2,764 m (9,068 ft), is the tallest mountain in Macedonia.\n\nIn the Republic of Macedonia there are 1,100 large sources of water. The rivers flow into three different basins: the Aegean, the Adriatic and the Black Sea.\n\nThe Aegean basin is the largest. It covers 87% of the territory of the Republic, which is . Vardar, the largest river in this basin, drains 80% of the territory or . Its valley plays an important part in the economy and the communication system of the country. The Vardar Valley project is considered to be crucial for the strategic development of the country.\n\nThe river Black Drin forms the Adriatic basin, which covers an area of about , i.e., 13% of the territory. It receives water from Lakes Prespa and Ohrid.\n\nThe Black Sea basin is the smallest with only . It covers the northern side of Mount Skopska Crna Gora. This is the source of the river Binachka Morava, which joins the Morava, and later, the Danube, which flows into the Black Sea.\n\nMacedonia has around fifty ponds and three natural lakes, Lake Ohrid, Lake Prespa and Lake Dojran.\n\nIn Macedonia there are nine spa towns and resorts: Banište, Banja Bansko, Istibanja, Katlanovo, Kežovica, Kosovrasti, Banja Kočani, Kumanovski Banji and Negorci.\n\nMacedonia has a transitional climate from Mediterranean to continental. The summers are hot and dry, and the winters are moderately cold. Average annual precipitation varies from in the western mountainous area to in the eastern area. There are three main climatic zones in the country: temperate Mediterranean, mountainous, and mildly continental. Along the valleys of the Vardar and Strumica rivers, in the regions of Gevgelija, Valandovo, Dojran, Strumica, and Radoviš, the climate is temperate Mediterranean. The warmest regions are Demir Kapija and Gevgelija, where the temperature in July and August frequently exceeds . The mountainous climate is present in the mountainous regions of the country, and it is characterised by long and snowy winters and short and cold summers. The spring is colder than the fall. The majority of Macedonia has a moderate continental climate with warm and dry summers and relatively cold and wet winters. There are thirty main and regular weather stations in the country.\n\nThe flora of Republic of Macedonia is represented by around 210 families, 920 genera, and around 3,700 plant species. The most abundant group are the flowering plants with around 3,200 species, followed by mosses (350 species) and ferns (42).\n\nPhytogeographically, Macedonia belongs to the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the European Environment Agency, the territory of the Republic can be subdivided into four ecoregions: the Pindus Mountains mixed forests, Balkan mixed forests, Rhodopes mixed forests and Aegean sclerophyllous and mixed forests.\n\nNational Park of Pelister in Bitola is known for the presence of the endemic Macedonian Pine, as well as some 88 species of plants representing almost 30 percent of Macedonian dendroflora. The Macedonian Pine forests on Pelister are divided into two communities: pine forests with ferns and pine forests with junipers. The Macedonian Pine, as a specific conifer species, is a relict of tertiary flora, and the five-needle pine Molika, was first noted on Pelister in 1893.\n\nMacedonia's limited forest growth also includes Macedonian Oaks, the sycamore, weeping willows, white willows, alders, poplars, elms, and the common ash. Near the rich pastures on Šar Mountain and Bistra, Mavrovo, is another plant species characteristic of plant life in Macedonia—the poppy. The quality of thick poppy juice is measured worldwide by morphine units; while Chinese opium contains eight such units and is considered to be of high quality, Indian opium contains seven units, and Turkish opium only six, Macedonian opium contains a full 14 morphine units and is one of the best quality opiums in the world.\n\nThe fauna of Macedonian forests is abundant and includes bears, wild boars, wolves, foxes, squirrels, chamois and deer. The lynx is found, although very rarely, in the mountains of western Macedonia, while deer can be found in the region of Demir Kapija. Forest birds include the blackcap, the grouse, the black grouse, the imperial eagle and the forest owl.\n\nThe three artificial lakes of the country represent a separate fauna zone, an indication of long-lasting territorial and temporal isolation. The fauna of Lake Ohrid is a relict of an earlier era and the lake is widely known for its letnica trout, lake whitefish, gudgeon, roach, podust, and pior, as well as for certain species of snails of a genus older than 30 million years; similar species can be found only in Lake Baikal. Lake Ohrid is also noted in zoology texts for the European eel and its baffling reproductive cycle: it comes to Lake Ohrid from the distant Sargasso Sea, thousands of kilometres away, and lurks in the depths of the lake for 10 years. When sexually mature, the eel is driven by unexplained instincts in the autumn to set off back to its point of birth. There it spawns and dies, leaving its offspring to seek out Lake Ohrid to begin the cycle anew.\nThe shepherd dog of Šar Mountain, the Šarplaninec (Yugoslav shepherd), is known worldwide. It stands some tall and is a brave and fierce fighter that may be called upon to fight bears or wolf packs while guarding and defending flocks. The Šarplaninec originates from the shepherd's dog of the ancient Epirotes, the molossus, but it was recognised as its own breed in 1939 under the name of \"Illyrian shepherd\" and since 1956 has been known as \"Šarplaninec\".\n\nThe country has three national parks:\n\nMacedonia is a parliamentary democracy with an executive government composed of a coalition of parties from the unicameral legislature (, ) and an independent judicial branch with a constitutional court. The Assembly is made up of 120 seats and the members are elected every four years. The role of the President of the Republic is mostly ceremonial, with the real power resting in the hands of the Prime Minister. The President is the commander-in-chief of the state armed forces and a president of the state Security Council. The President is elected every five years and he or she can be elected twice at most. On the second run of the presidential elections held on 5 April 2009, Gjorge Ivanov was elected as new Macedonian president.\n\nWith the passage of a new law and elections held in 2005, local government functions are divided between 78 municipalities (, ; singular: , ). The capital, Skopje, is governed as a group of ten municipalities collectively referred to as the \"City of Skopje\". Municipalities in Macedonia are units of local self-government. Neighbouring municipalities may establish co-operative arrangements.\n\nThe country's main political divergence is between the largely ethnically based political parties representing the country's ethnic Macedonian majority and Albanian minority. The issue of the power balance between the two communities led to a brief war in 2001, following which a power-sharing agreement was reached. In August 2004, Macedonia's parliament passed legislation redrawing local boundaries and giving greater local autonomy to ethnic Albanians in areas where they predominate.\n\nAfter a troublesome pre-election campaign, Macedonia saw a relatively calm and democratic change of government in the elections held on 5 July 2006. The elections were marked by a decisive victory of the centre-right party VMRO-DPMNE led by Nikola Gruevski. Gruevski's decision to include the Democratic Party of Albanians in the new government, instead of the Democratic Union for Integration – Party for Democratic Prosperity coalition which won the majority of the Albanian votes, triggered protests throughout the parts of the country with a respective number of Albanian population. However, a dialogue was later established between the Democratic Union for Integration and the ruling VMRO-DMPNE party as an effort to talk about the disputes between the two parties and to support European and NATO aspirations of the country.\n\nAfter the early parliamentary elections held in 2008, VMRO-DPMNE and Democratic Union for Integration formed a ruling coalition in Macedonia.\n\nIn April 2009, presidential and local elections in the country were carried out peacefully, which was crucial for Macedonian aspirations to join the EU. The ruling conservative VMRO-DPMNE party won a victory in the local elections and the candidate supported by the party, Gjorgi Ivanov, was elected as the new president.\n\n, the Prime Minister of Macedonia is Zoran Zaev, who also heads the SDUM, and the current President of the Parliament is Talat Xhaferi. The election of Xhaferi was immediately met with protests led by VMRO-DPMNE, which was quickly handled by Macedonian police.\n\nParliament, or \"Sobranie\" (), is the country's legislative body. It makes, proposes and adopts laws. The Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia has been in use since the formation of the republic in the 1993. It limits the power of the governments, both local and national. The military is also limited by the constitution. The constitution states that Macedonia is a social free state, and that Skopje is the capital. The 120 members are elected for a mandate of four years through a general election. Each citizen aged 18 years or older can vote for one of the political parties. The current president of Parliament is Talat Xhaferi.\n\nExecutive power in Macedonia is exercised by the Government, whose prime minister is the most politically powerful person in the country. The members of the government are chosen by the Prime Minister and there are ministers for each branch of the society. There are ministers for economy, finance, information technology, society, internal affairs, foreign affairs and other areas. The members of the Government are elected for a mandate of four years. The current Prime Minister is Zoran Zaev.\nJudiciary power is exercised by courts, with the court system being headed by the Judicial Supreme court, Constitutional Court and the Republican Judicial Council. The assembly appoints the judges.\n\nMacedonia became a member state of the UN on 8 April 1993, eighteen months after its independence from Yugoslavia. It is referred to within the UN as \"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\", pending a resolution of the long-running dispute with Greece about the country's name.\n\nThe major interest of the country is a full integration in the European and the Trans-Atlantic integration processes. Five foreign policy priorities are:\n\n\nMacedonia is a member of the following international and regional organisations: IMF (since 1992), WHO (since 1993), EBRD (since 1993), Central European Initiative (since 1993), Council of Europe (since 1995), OSCE (since 1995), SECI (since 1996), WTO (since 2003), CEFTA (since 2006), La Francophonie (since 2001).\n\nIn 2005, the country was officially recognised as a European Union candidate state.\n\nAt the NATO 2008 Bucharest summit, Macedonia failed to gain an invitation to join the organisation because Greece vetoed the move after the dispute over the name issue. The USA had previously expressed support for an invitation, but the summit then decided to extend an invitation only on condition of a resolution of the naming conflict with Greece.\n\nIn March 2009, the European Parliament expressed support for Macedonia's EU candidacy and asked the EU Commission to grant the country a date for the start of accession talks by the end of 2009. The parliament also recommended a speedy lifting of the visa regime for Macedonian citizens. However, Macedonia has so far failed to receive a start date for accession talks as a result of the naming dispute. The EU's stance is similar to NATO's in that resolution of the naming dispute is a precondition for the start of accession talks.\n\nIn October 2012, the EU Enlargement Commissioner Štefan Füle proposed a start of accession negotiations with Macedonia for the fourth time, while the previous efforts were blocked each time by Greece. At the same time Füle visited Bulgaria in a bid to clarify the state's position with respect to Macedonia. He established that Bulgaria almost has joined Greece in vetoing the accession talks with Macedonia. The Bulgarian position was that Sofia cannot grant an EU certificate to Skopje, which is systematically employing an ideology of hate towards Bulgaria.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights and the U.N. Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and Convention against Torture, and the Constitution guarantees basic human rights to all Macedonian citizens.\n\nThere do, however, continue to be problems with human rights. According to human rights organisations, in 2003 there were suspected extrajudicial executions, threats against, and intimidation of, human rights activists and opposition journalists, and allegations of torture by the police.\n\nThe Macedonian Armed Forces comprise the army, air force and Special Forces. The government's national defence policy aims to guarantee the preservation of the independence and sovereignty of the state, the integrity of its land area and airspace and its constitutional order. Its main goals remain the development and maintenance of a credible capability to defend the nation's vital interests and development of the Armed Forces in a way that ensures their interoperability with the armed forces of NATO and the European Union member states and their capability to participate in the full range of NATO missions.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence develops the Republic's defence strategy and assesses possible threats and risks. It is also responsible for the defence system, including training, readiness, equipment, and development, and for drawing up and presenting the defence budget.\n\nAfter the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, the name of Macedonia became the object of a dispute between Greece and the newly independent Republic of Macedonia. In the south, the Republic of Macedonia borders the region of Greek Macedonia, which administratively is split into three peripheries (one of them comprising both Western Thrace and a part of Greek Macedonia). Citing historical and territorial concerns resulting from the ambiguity between the Republic of Macedonia, the adjacent Greek region of Macedonia and the ancient Kingdom of Macedon which falls within Greek Macedonia, Greece opposes the use of the name \"Macedonia\" by the Republic of Macedonia without a geographical qualifier, supporting a compound name (such as \"North Macedonia\") for use by all and for all purposes (\"erga omnes\"). As millions of ethnic Greeks identify themselves as Macedonians, unrelated to the Slavic people who are associated with the Republic of Macedonia, Greece further objects to the use of the term \"Macedonian\" for the neighboring country's largest ethnic group. The Republic of Macedonia is accused of appropriating symbols and figures that are historically considered parts of Greece's culture (such as Vergina Sun, a symbol associated with the ancient Kingdom of Macedon, and Alexander the Great), and of promoting the irredentist concept of a United Macedonia, which would include territories of Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1995, the two countries engaged in a dispute over the Macedonian state's new flag, which incorporated the Vergina Sun symbol. This aspect of the dispute was resolved when the flag was changed under the terms of an interim accord agreed between the two states in October 1995.\nThe UN adopted the provisional reference \"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" () when the country was admitted to the organisation in 1993. Most international organisations, such as the European Union, the European Broadcasting Union, and the International Olympic Committee, adopted the same convention. NATO also uses the reference in official documents but adds an explanation on which member countries recognise the constitutional name. The same reference is also used in any discussion to which Greece is a party\n\nHowever, most UN member countries have abandoned the provisional reference and have recognised the country as the \"Republic of Macedonia\" instead. These include four of the five permanent UN Security Council members: the United States, Russia, United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China; several members of the European Union such as Bulgaria, Poland, and Slovenia; and over 100 other UN members. The UN has set up a negotiating process with a mediator, Matthew Nimetz, and the two parties to the dispute, Macedonia and Greece, to try to mediate the dispute.\n\nInitially the European Community-nominated Arbitration Commission's opinion was that \"the use of the name 'Macedonia' cannot therefore imply any territorial claim against another State\"; despite the commission's opinion, Greece continued to object to the establishment of relations between the Community and the Republic under its constitutional name.\n\nSince the coming to power in 2006, and especially since Macedonia's non-invitation to NATO in 2008, the VMRO-DPMNE government has pursued a policy of \"Antiquisation\" (\"Antikvizatzija\") as a way of putting pressure on Greece as well as for the purposes of domestic identity-building. Statues of Alexander the Great and Philip of Macedon have been built in several cities across the country. Additionally, many pieces of public infrastructure, such as airports, highways, and stadiums have been renamed after Alexander and Philip. These actions are seen as deliberate provocations in neighboring Greece, exacerbating the dispute and further stalling Macedonia's EU and NATO applications. The policy has also attracted criticism domestically, as well as from EU diplomats.\n\nIn November 2008, Macedonia instituted proceedings before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Greece alleging violations of the 1995 Interim Accord that blocked its accession to NATO. The ICJ was requested to order Greece to observe its obligations within the Accord, which is legally binding for both countries. In 2011, The United Nations' International Court of Justice ruled that Greece violated Article 11 of the 1995 Interim Accord by vetoing Macedonia's bid for NATO membership at the 2008 summit in Bucharest. The court, however, did not consider it necessary to grant Macedonia's request that it instruct Greece to refrain from similar actions in the future since \"[a]s a general rule, there is no reason to suppose that a State whose act or conduct has been declared wrongful by the Court will repeat that act or conduct in the future, since its good faith must be presumed\"; nor has there been to date a change in the EU's stance that Macedonia's accession negotiations cannot begin until the name issue is resolved.\n\nOn 17 June 2018, Greece and Macedonia signed an agreement to end their dispute, which would result in Macedonia being renamed the \"Republic of North Macedonia\" (Република Северна Македонија). The agreement still requires ratification by both parliaments to come into effect. As of June 2018, both governments are expected to have to overcome stiff political opposition in their respective countries in order to conclude this process. Macedonia held an advisory referendum about the required changes to its constitution in September 2018.\n\nMacedonia's statistical regions exist solely for legal and statistical purposes. The regions are:\n\nIn August 2004, the Republic of Macedonia was reorganised into 84 municipalities (; sing. ); 10 of the municipalities constitute the City of Skopje, a distinct unit of local self-government and the country's capital.\n\nMost of the current municipalities were unaltered or merely amalgamated from the previous 123 municipalities established in September 1996; others were consolidated and their borders changed. Prior to this, local government was organised into 34 administrative districts, communes, or counties (also opštini).\n\nRanked as the fourth \"best reformatory state\" out of 178 countries ranked by the World Bank in 2009, Macedonia has undergone considerable economic reform since independence. The country has developed an open economy with trade accounting for more than 90% of GDP in recent years. Since 1996, Macedonia has witnessed steady, though slow, economic growth with GDP growing by 3.1% in 2005. This figure was projected to rise to an average of 5.2% in the 2006–2010 period. The government has proven successful in its efforts to combat inflation, with an inflation rate of only 3% in 2006 and 2% in 2007, and has implemented policies focused on attracting foreign investment and promoting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The current government introduced a flat tax system with the intention of making the country more attractive to foreign investment. The flat tax rate was 12% in 2007 and was further lowered to 10% in 2008.\nDespite these reforms, Macedonia's unemployment rate was 37.2% and its poverty rate was 22%. However, due to a number of employment measures as well as the successful process of attracting multinational corporations, and according to the Macedonian State Statistical Office, country's unemployment rate in the first quarter of 2015 decreased to 27.3%. Government's policies and efforts in regards to foreign direct investments have resulted with the establishment of local subsidiaries of several world leading manufacturing companies, especially from the automotive industry, such as: Johnson Controls Inc., Van Hool NV, Johnson Matthey plc, Lear Corp., Visteon Corp., Kostal GmbH, Gentherm Inc., Dräxlmaier Group, Kromberg & Schubert, Marquardt GmbH, Amphenol Corp., Tekno Hose SpA, KEMET Corp., Key Safety Systems Inc., ODW-Elektrik GmbH, etc.\n\nMacedonia has one of the highest shares of people struggling financially, with 72% of its citizens stating that they could manage on their household's income only \"with difficulty\" or \"with great difficulty\", though Macedonia, along with Croatia, was the only country in the Western Balkans to not report an increase in this statistic. Corruption and a relatively ineffective legal system also act as significant restraints on successful economic development. Macedonia still has one of the lowest per capita GDPs in Europe. Furthermore, the country's grey market is estimated at close to 20% of GDP.\nIn terms of GDP structure, the manufacturing sector, including mining and construction constituted the largest part of GDP at 21.4%, up from 21.1% in 2012. The trade, transportation and accommodation sector represents 18.2% of GDP in 2013, up from 16.7% in 2012, while agriculture represents 9.6%, up from 9.1% in the previous year.\n\nIn terms of foreign trade, the largest sector contributing to the country's export in 2014 was \"chemicals and related products\" at 21.4%, followed by the \"machinery and transport equipment\" sector at 21.1%. Macedonia's main import sectors in 2014 were \"manufactured goods classified chiefly by material\" with 34.2%, \"machinery and transport equipment\" with 18.7% and \"mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials\" with 14.4% of the total imports. Even 68.8% of the foreign trade in 2014 was done with the EU which makes the Union by far the largest trading partner of Macedonia (23.3% with Germany, 7.9% with the UK, 7.3% with Greece, 6.2% with Italy, etc.). Almost 12% of the total external trade in 2014 was done with the Western Balkan countries.\n\nWith a GDP per capita of US$9,157 at purchasing power parity and a Human Development Index of 0.701, Macedonia is less developed and has a considerably smaller economy than most of the former Yugoslav states.\n\nAccording to Eurostat data, Macedonian PPS GDP per capita stood at 36% of the EU average in 2014.\n\nMacedonia (along with Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo) belongs to the less-developed southern region of the former Yugoslavia. It suffered severe economic difficulties after independence, when the Yugoslav internal market collapsed and subsidies from Belgrade ended. In addition, it faced many of the same problems faced by other former socialist East European countries during the transition to a market economy. Its main land and rail exports route, through Serbia, remains unreliable with high transit costs, thereby affecting the export of its formerly highly profitable, early vegetables market to Germany. Macedonia's IT market increased 63.8% year on year in 2007, which is the fastest growing in the Adriatic region.\n\nThe outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the imposition of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro caused great damage to the Republic's economy, with Serbia constituting 60% of its markets before the disintegration of Yugoslavia. When Greece imposed a trade embargo on the Republic in 1994–95, the economy was also affected. Some relief was afforded by the end of the Bosnian War in November 1995 and the lifting of the Greek embargo, but the Kosovo War of 1999 and the 2001 Albanian crisis caused further destabilisation.\n\nSince the end of the Greek embargo, Greece has become the country's most important business partner. (See Greek investments in the Republic of Macedonia.) Many Greek companies have bought former state companies in Macedonia, such as the oil refinery Okta, the baking company Zhito Luks, a marble mine in Prilep, textile facilities in Bitola, etc., and employ 20,000 people. However, local cross-border trade between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia sees thousands of Greek shoppers visiting to purchase cheaper domestic products. The moving of business to Macedonia in the oil sector has been caused by the rise of Greece in the oil markets.\n\nOther key partners are Germany, Italy, the United States, Slovenia, Austria and Turkey.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia is in its position a continental country in the middle of the Balkan peninsula, and the main transport links in the country are those that connect the different parts of the peninsula (transbalkan links). Particularly important is the connection between north-south and Vardar valley, which connects Greece with the rest of Europe.\n\nThe total length of the railway network in the Republic of Macedonia is 699 km. The most important railway line is the line on the border with Serbia – Kumanovo – Skopje – Veles – Gevgelija – border with Greece. Since 2001, the railway line Beljakovci has been built – the border with Bulgaria, which will get a direct connection Skopje-Sofia. The most important railway hub in the country is Skopje, while the other two are Veles and Kumanovo.\n\nMacedonian Post is a Macedonian state-owned company for the provision of postal traffic. It was founded in 1992 as PTT Macedonia. In 1993 she was admitted to the World Postal Union in 1997, PTT Macedonia was divided into Macedonian Telekom and Macedonian Post. As far as Water Transport is concerned, only lake traffic through Ohrid and Prespan Lake has been developed, mostly for tourist purposes.\n\nThere are 17 airports officially in the Republic of Macedonia, of which 11 are with solid substrates. Among them are two airports of international character, since they are listed on the airport's IATA Airport code International Airport Skopje and Ohrid \"St. Paul the Apostle\" Airport.\n\nTourism is an important part of the economy of the Republic of Macedonia. The country's abundance of natural and cultural attractions make it an attractive destination of visitors. It receives about 700,000 tourists annually.\n\nThe last census data from 2002 shows a population of 2,022,547 inhabitants.\nThe last official estimate from 2009, without significant change, gives a figure of 2,050,671. According to the last census data, the largest ethnic group in the country are the ethnic Macedonians. The second largest group are the Albanians who dominated much of the northwestern part of the country. Following them, Turks are the third biggest ethnic group of the country where official census data put them close to 80,000 and unofficial estimates suggest numbers between 170,000 and 200,000. Some unofficial estimates indicate that in the Republic of Macedonia, there are possibly up to 260,000 Romani.\n\nEastern Orthodox Christianity is the majority faith of the Republic of Macedonia, making up 65% of the population, the vast majority of whom belong to the Macedonian Orthodox Church. Various other Christian denominations account for 0.4% of the population. Muslims constitute 33.3% of the population. Macedonia has the fifth-highest proportion of Muslims in Europe, after those of Kosovo (96%), Turkey (90%), Albania (59%), and Bosnia-Herzegovina (51%). Most Muslims are Albanians, Turks, or Romani, although few are Macedonian Muslims. The remaining 1.4% was determined to be \"unaffiliated\" by a 2010 Pew Research estimation.\n\nAltogether, there were 1,842 churches and 580 mosques in the country at the end of 2011. The Orthodox and Islamic religious communities have secondary religion schools in Skopje. There is an Orthodox theological college in the capital. The Macedonian Orthodox Church has jurisdiction over 10 provinces (seven in the country and three abroad), has 10 bishops and about 350 priests. A total of 30,000 people are baptised in all the provinces every year.\n\nRelations between the Macedonian Orthodox Church, which declared autocephaly in 1967 and remains unrecognised by the other Orthodox Churches, and the Serbian Orthodox Church, which claims ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the Republic of Macedonia, remain tense and politically fraught, especially since the Serbian Church appointed Jovan Vraniškovski as its Exarch for the Archbishopric of Ohrid in September 2002. \nThe reaction of the Macedonian Orthodox Church was to cut off all relations with the new Ohrid Archbishopric and to prevent bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church from entering Macedonia. Bishop Jovan was jailed for 18 months for \"defaming the Macedonian Orthodox church and harming the religious feelings of local citizens\" by distributing Serbian Orthodox church calendars and pamphlets.\n\nThe Macedonian Byzantine Catholic Church has approximately 11,000 adherents in Macedonia. The Church was established in 1918, and is made up mostly of converts to Catholicism and their descendants. The Church is of the Byzantine Rite and is in communion with the Roman and Eastern Catholic Churches. Its liturgical worship is performed in Macedonian.\n\nThere is a small Protestant community. The most famous Protestant in the country is the late president Boris Trajkovski. He was from the Methodist community, which is the largest and oldest Protestant church in the Republic, dating back to the late 19th century. Since the 1980s the Protestant community has grown, partly through new confidence and partly with outside missionary help.\n\nThe Macedonian Jewish community, which numbered some 7,200 people on the eve of World War II, was almost entirely destroyed during the war: only 2% of Macedonian Jews survived the Holocaust. After their liberation and the end of the War, most opted to emigrate to Israel. Today, the country's Jewish community numbers approximately 200 persons, almost all of whom live in Skopje. Most Macedonian Jews are Sephardic – the descendants of 15th-century refugees who had been expelled from Castile, Aragon and Portugal.\n\nAccording to the 2002 Census, 46.5% of the children aged 0–4 were Muslim.\n\nThe official and most widely spoken language is Macedonian, which belongs to the Eastern branch of the South Slavic language group. In municipalities where ethnic groups are represented with over 20% of the total population, the language of that ethnic group is co-official.\n\nMacedonian is closely related to and mutually intelligible with standard Bulgarian. It also has some similarities with standard Serbian and the intermediate Torlakian and Shop dialects spoken mostly in southern Serbia and western Bulgaria (and by speakers in the north and east of Macedonia). The standard language was codified in the period following World War II and has accumulated a thriving literary tradition. Although it is the only language explicitly designated as an official national language in the constitution, in municipalities where at least 20% of the population is part of another ethnic minority, those individual languages are used for official purposes in local government, alongside Macedonian.\n\nA wide variety of languages are spoken in Macedonia, reflecting its ethnic diversity. Besides the official national language, Macedonian, minority languages with substantial numbers of speakers are Albanian, Romani, Turkish (including Balkan Gagauz), Serbian/Bosnian and Aromanian (including Megleno-Romanian). There are a few villages of Adyghe speakers and an immigrant Greek community. Macedonian Sign Language is the primary language of those of the deaf community who did not pick up an oral language in childhood.\n\nAccording to the last census, 1,344,815 Macedonian citizens declared that they spoke Macedonian, 507,989 declared Albanian, 71,757 Turkish, 38,528 Romani, 6,884 Aromanian, 24,773 Serbian, 8,560 Bosnian, and 19,241 spoke other languages.\n\nThe higher levels of education can be obtained at one of the five state universities: Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, St. Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola, Goce Delčev University of Štip, State University of Tetovo and University for Information Science and Technology \"St. Paul The Apostle\" in Ohrid. There are a number of private university institutions, such as the European University, Slavic University in Sveti Nikole, the South East European University and others.\n\nThe United States Agency for International Development has underwritten a project called \"Macedonia Connects\", which has made Macedonia the first all-broadband wireless country in the world. The Ministry of Education and Sciences reports that 461 schools (primary and secondary) are now connected to the internet. In addition, an Internet service provider (On.net), has created a MESH Network to provide WIFI services in the 11 largest cities/towns in the country. The national library of Macedonia, National and University Library \"St. Kliment of Ohrid\", is in Skopje.\n\nThe Macedonian education system consists of:\n\nMacedonia has a rich cultural heritage in art, architecture, poetry, and music. It has many ancient, protected religious sites. Poetry, cinema, and music festivals are held annually. Macedonian music styles developed under the strong influence of Byzantine church music. Macedonia has a significant number of preserved Byzantine fresco paintings, mainly from the period between the 11th and 16th centuries. There are several thousands square metres of fresco painting preserved, the major part of which is in very good condition and represent masterworks of the Macedonian School of ecclesiastical painting.\n\nThe most important cultural events in the country are the Ohrid Summer festival of classical music and drama, the Struga Poetry Evenings which gather poets from more than 50 countries in the world, International Camera Festival in Bitola, Open Youth Theatre and Skopje Jazz Festival in Skopje etc.\nThe Macedonian Opera opened in 1947 with a performance of \"Cavalleria rusticana\" under the direction of Branko Pomorisac. Every year, the May Opera Evenings are held in Skopje for around 20 nights. The first May Opera performance was that of Kiril Makedonski's \"Tsar Samuil\" in May 1972.\n\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of that of the Balkans—reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\nFamous for its rich Šopska salad, an appetiser and side dish which accompanies almost every meal, Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its dairy products, wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as rakija. Tavče Gravče and mastika are considered the national dish and drink of the Republic of Macedonia, respectively.\n\nFootball and handball are the most popular sports in Macedonia. The national football team is controlled by the Football Federation of Macedonia. Their home stadium is the Philip II Arena.\n\nHandball is the other important team sport in the country. In 2002 Kometal Skopje won the EHF Women's Champions League European Cup. The European Women's Handball Championship took place in 2008 in Macedonia. The venues in which the tournament took place were located in Skopje and Ohrid; the national team finished seventh place. Macedonian clubs enjoyed success in European competitions. RK Vardar won 2016–17 EHF Champions League, while Kometal Gjorče Petrov Skopje won the women's event in 2002.\n\nThe Macedonian national basketball team represents the Republic of Macedonia in international basketball. The team is run by the Basketball Federation of Macedonia, the governing body of basketball in Macedonia which was created in 1992 and joined FIBA in 1993. Macedonia has participated in three Eurobaskets since then with its best finish at 4th place in 2011. It plays its home games at the Boris Trajkovski Arena in Skopje.\n\nIn the summer months The Ohrid Swimming Marathon is an annual event on Lake Ohrid and during the winter months there is skiing in Macedonia's winter sports centres. Macedonia also takes part in the Olympic Games. Participation in the Games is organised by the Macedonian Olympic Committee.\n\nThe history of film making in the republic dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by Janaki and Milton Manaki in Bitola. Throughout the past century, the medium of film has depicted the history, culture and everyday life of the Macedonian people. Over the years many Macedonian films have been presented at film festivals around the world and several of these films have won prestigious awards. The first Macedonian feature film was \"Frosina\", released in 1952. The first feature film in colour was \"Miss Stone\", a movie about a Protestant missionary in Ottoman Macedonia. It was released in 1958. The highest grossing feature film in the Republic of Macedonia was \"Bal-Can-Can\", having been seen by over 500,000 people in its first year alone.\nIn 1994 Milco Manchevski's film \"Before the Rain\" was nominated as Best Foreign Film. Manchevski continues to be the most prominent modern filmmaker in the country having subsequently written and directed \"Dust\" and \"Shadows\".\n\nThe oldest newspaper in the country is \"Nova Makedonija\" from 1944. Other well known newspaper and magazines are: \"Utrinski vesnik\", \"Dnevnik\", \"Vest\", \"Fokus\", \"Večer\", \"Tea Moderna\", \"Makedonsko Sonce\", and \"Koha\".

In 1991 they released the first album \"Pakáreň\" through Opus Records. Ozi leaves the band after the release and is replaced by Juraj Černý, at that time also a member of hard rock/heavy metal band Tublatanka, who played drums on two tracks from Pakáreň. Shortly afterwards the band adds secondary drummer Čunďo (Roman Čunderlík) who variously switches places with Černý until 1994. Band members took hard drugs (heroin with methamphetamine) that would influence their darker second album \"Unavení a zničení\" (trans. Tired and Broken) but eventually also almost destroy their lives. Due to various problems the band went on hiatus in 1995.\n\nSlobodná Európa reformed in 2002 when Whisky married Dorota Nvotová. Černý, who was a part of the reunion is soon replaced by Tuleň (Tomáš Vojtek) and the band records their new album \"Trojka\". In 2004 the band adds new guitarist Temo (Braňo Černák) who also fills in for Korbel during latter's personal hiatus from the band between 2004 and 2006. Tuleň left in 2006 and was replaced by Juraj Vitez. In 2011 Černý returned to the band. Alex was dropped from the line-up in 2012 due to health reasons and drug addiction and was replaced by Žumo. This line-up recorded and released fourth album \"Štvorka\" in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
