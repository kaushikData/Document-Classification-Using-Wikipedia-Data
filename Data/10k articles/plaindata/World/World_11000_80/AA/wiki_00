{"id": "2602832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2602832", "title": "Blackened death metal", "text": "Blackened death metal\n\nBlackened death metal (also known as black death metal) is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal that fuses elements of black metal and death metal.\n\nThe genre emerged in early 1990s when black metal bands began incorporating elements of death metal, and vice-versa. The genre typically employs death growls, tremolo picking, blast beats, and Satanic lyrics and imagery. Bands of the genre typically employ corpse paint, which was adapted from black metal.\n\nThe genre is commonly death metal that incorporates musical, lyrical or ideological elements of black metal, such as an increased use of tremolo picking, anti-Christian or Satanic lyrical themes and chord progressions similar to those used in black metal. Blackened death metal bands are also more likely to wear corpse paint and suits of armour, than bands from other styles of death metal. Lower range guitar tunings, death growls and abrupt tempo changes are common in the genre. Some blackened death metal bands, such as Goatwhore and Angelcorpse, even take significant influence from thrash metal.\n\nBoth black metal and death metal evolved out of the same crop of early extreme metal bands such as Dark Angel, Possessed, Kreator, Sodom, Venom, Celtic Frost and Bathory, leading to common elements between the genres being in place, early death metal groups with some elements common in black metal include early-Sepultura, Morbid Angel and Deicide. Along with this, John McEntee, guitarist and vocalist of death metal band Incantation, has noted that he and his band draw influence from black metal. Seminal black metal band Darkthrone began playing death metal, before moving into the style they became primarily known for.\n\nBlasphemy crossed death metal and black metal on their debut album \"Fallen Angel of Doom\", giving way to the development of war metal. Dissection evolved out of the Gothenburg melodic death metal scene, embracing black metal influences into their music and helping create melodic black-death thanks to their 1993 album \"The Somberlain\".\n\nThe year 1998 saw the release of Behemoth's album \"Pandemonic Incantations\", striking a stylistic change in the sound of the band's output from a traditional black metal style with generally pagan lyrical themes into a more death metal influenced sound with lyrics about the occult and Satan. After continuing this style, their 2000 album \"Thelema.6\" peaked at number 31 on the Polish Albums Charts. Many of Behemoth's subsequent albums would continue to chart, with Demigod peaking at number 15, The Apostasy at number 9 and \"Evangelion\" and \"The Satanist\" both at number one, with multiple albums charting worldwide. American band Skeletonwitch's third, fourth and fifth albums peaked at numbers 151, 153 and 62, respectively, on the Billboard 200 charts.\n\nThy Art Is Murder, a band who previously played deathcore, moved into a style more similar to blackened death metal on their fourth album \"Dear Desolation\", charting in eight different territories, including a peak at number five on the Australian Albums Charts and number seven on the New Zealand Heatseekers Albums. As well as New Jersey's Lorna Shore also beginning to tread similarly into the grounds of blackened death metal on their sophomore album \"Flesh Coffin\".\n\nMelodic black-death (also known as blackened melodic death metal or melodic blackened death metal) is a genre of extreme metal that describes the style created when melodic death metal bands began being inspired by black metal and European romanticism. However, unlike most other black metal, this take on the genre would incorporate an increased sense of melody and narrative. Some bands who have played this style include Dissection, Sacramentum, Embraced, Naglfar, God Dethroned, Satariel, Throes of Dawn, Obscurity, Dawn, Cries of the Past-era Underoath, Catamenia, Midvinter, Twin Obscenity, Nokturnal Mortum Unanimated, Epoch of Unlight, This Ending, Suidakra, Oathean, Thulcandra, Skeletonwitch and Cardinal Sin.\n\nSweden's Dissection evolved alongside melodic death metal bands such as At the Gates and In Flames, by building upon the musical foundation laid by death metal and incorporating guitar melodies and harmonies amongst the standard brutality of the genre. However, unlike the other bands, Dissection began incorporating influences from black metal into their music, which lead to their debut album \"The Somberlain\" influencing a plethora of subsequent bands and \"Metal Injection\" dubbing them \"one of the most important extreme metal bands of all time\". Sacramentum's debut and sophomore albums \"Far Away from the Sun\" and \"The Coming of Chaos\" would then continue Dissection's style of black metal-infused melodic death metal, based around middle of the neck guitar riffing and howling vocals, while Vinterland would lean even more upon their black metal predecessors like Norway's Emperor. Naglfar would base their sound primarily within that of Gothenburg metal bands like In Flames and Dark Tranquility, by taking a brighter and thrashier take on the style.\n\nWar metal (also known as war black metal or bestial black metal) is an aggressive, cacophonous and chaotic subgenre of blackened death metal, described by \"Rock Hard\" journalist Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann as \"rabid\" and \"hammering\". Important influences include first wave black metal band Sodom, first wave black metal/death metal band Possessed as well as old grindcore, black and death metal bands like Repulsion, Autopsy, Sarcófago and the first two Sepultura releases. War metal bands include Blasphemy, Archgoat, Impiety, In Battle, Beherit, Crimson Thorn, Bestial Warlust and Zyklon-B.\n\n"}

The Chamber is the voice of local authorities (cities and municipalities) in the Council of Europe. It consists of 324 representatives from the Council’s 47 member states, who either hold a general local authority mandate from direct elections or are politically accountable to a directly elected assembly. The Chamber provides an opportunity for local officials to discuss common concerns, share their experiences and develop relevant policies.\n\nAccording to the new Charter of the Congress adopted on 2 May 2007 by the Committee of Ministers, the Chamber’s membership is based on the principles of balanced geographical distribution, equitable representation of the various types of local authorities and their political groups, as well as of equitable representation of women and men. The Chamber drafts reports, recommendations, resolutions and opinions on the issues of its concern and presents them to the Standing Committee of the Congress for adoption.\n\nPrior to the creation of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe in 1994, the Conference of Local and Regional Authorities was in place. The first existence and idea of a body addressing with the issue local government was proposed in 1957 but the standing conference was not created until 1961. This standing conference had existed since 1961. This institutionalisation in 1994 demonstrated the progress and importance of local governance and regional control in the development of Europe. The behavior and actions of the chamber (along with the Chamber of Regions) are based in the European Charter of Local Self-Government which was opened for signature and ratification in 1985.\n\nIn October 2010, the Congress laid out its priorities for 2011-2012 as part of the reform process which included a modification of its committee structure from four statutory committees to three. The four prior existing committees were the Institutional Committee, the Culture and Education Committee, the Committee on Social Cohesion and the Committee on Sustainable Development. The three newly created committees are the Monitoring Committee, the Governance Committee and the Current Affairs Committee. This change was approved in December 2010.\n\nAccording to the Congress' official website:\n\n\"The Committee on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments by member states of the European Charter of Local Self-Government - Monitoring Committee - is responsible, in particular, for monitoring the application of the Charter as well as institutional developments in Europe’s regions, for preparing reports on the situation of local and regional democracy in Europe and for monitoring specific questions related to local and regional democracy in the member states.\"\n\n\"The Governance Committee is responsible for affairs falling within the scope of the Congress' statutory mandate such as governance, public finance, cross-border and interregional co-operation and e-democracy as well as co-operation with intergovernmental bodies.\"\n\n\"The Current Affairs Committee is responsible for studying the role of local and regional authorities with regard to the major challenges of our society and preparing work on thematic issues such as social cohesion, education, culture and sustainable development from the point of view of the Council of Europe's core values.\"\n\nThe Chamber elects its President among its members for two years, and appoints the Bureau composed of the President (currently Jean-Claude Frécon of France) and seven Vice-Presidents respecting as far as possible a fair geographic distribution among the member states.

The film opens with the caption: 'Unfortunately this is a true story...' plus skylines of Kampala City. It stars Adnan Senkumba who plays Kenneth Senkumba, a man with a dream to submit his award-worthy script entitled \"The Bad Mexican\" to an influential producer at the Masters Music office so that he can make loads of money. He dreams that it will be more than enough to refund Moses (played by Joel Okuyo Atiku) in full and also enjoy himself at the beach with girls. Despite paying the 'thug' for the past eight months, the money keeps accumulating. Ken owes him $300 and he always collects. While driving himself to deliver the script, Kenneth parks after his friend tells him on phone that Moses wants him and he had given him Ken's number; he would rather kill himself than let Moses torture him. Ken's stomach starts grumbling because of the bad Mexican food he had eaten as recommended by the friend. He shits in his pants and has to change them in time for the presentation, his friend (advised by Jess - a girlfriend sitted on a sofa and watching TV) tries telling him to contact a company called Trendz that delivers clothes by GPS but because of bugs in their app; a motorcycle courier instead delivers a grey French cap (\"nkofira\") worth 20,000 UgX. Disappointed, Ken is forced to pay the young lad (he had earlier splashed water on from a pothole puddle in Industrial Area) for his multi-coloured 'ugly trousers'. The boy walks away happy in his boxers with some cash in hand. After submitting his script in a khaki envelope, a lady gives him a number and tells him not to call it but rather they would use it to call him if he is selected. The following day, Moses holding a bat and his three goons start looking for Ken at his apartment block. The film features dialogue in English, Luganda and Lugbara though captioned. \n\n\"The Bad Mexican\" has been screened at various film festivals including the Zanzibar International Film Festival (ZIFF) and Ngalabi Short Film Festival. Jude Zambarakji commented, \"The editing was excellent!\" Dorothy Lewa Bende and Shifah Musisi thought the film was \"amazing\". Scene transitions caught people's attention and the CGI of the helicopter was very photorealistic basing on the fact that Loukman is a creative motion graphics designer and sketch artist.\n"}
