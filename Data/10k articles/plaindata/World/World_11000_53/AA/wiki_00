{"id": "20965908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20965908", "title": "Economic liberalisation in India", "text": "Economic liberalisation in India\n\nThe economic liberalisation in India refers to the changes and reforms, initiated in 1991, of the country's economic policies, with the goal of making the economy more market- and service-oriented, and expanding the role of private and foreign investment. Most of these changes were made as part of the conditions laid out by the World Bank and the IMF as a condition for a $500 million bail out to the Indian government in December 1991. Specific changes include a reduction in import tariffs, deregulation of markets, reduction of taxes, and greater foreign investment. Liberalisation has been credited by its proponents for the high economic growth recorded by the country in the 1990s and 2000s. Its opponents have blamed it for increased inequality and economic degradation. The overall direction of liberalisation has since remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has yet solved a variety of politically difficult issues, such as liberalising labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies. There exists a lively debate in India as to whether the economic reforms were sustainable and beneficial to the people of India as a whole.\n\nIndian government coalitions have been advised by the IMF and World Bank to continue liberalisation. Before 2015, India grew at a slower pace than China, which had been liberalising its economy since 1978. In 2015, India's GDP growth outpaced that of China. \"The McKinsey Quarterly\" stated that removing major obstacles \"would free India's economy to grow as fast as China's, at 10% a year\".\n\nThere has been significant debate, however, around liberalisation as an inclusive economic growth strategy. Income inequality has deepened in India since 1992, with consumption among the poorest staying stable while the wealthiest generate consumption growth. India's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in 2012–13 was the lowest for a decade, at just 5.1%, at which time more criticism of India's economic reforms surfaced; it apparently failed to address employment growth, nutritional values in terms of food intake in calories, and also export growth—and thereby was leading to a worsening current account deficit compared to the period prior to reform. The country continues to perform poorly in all developmental aspects, with high unemployment among the youth, poor women's security, rampant corruption, the highest number of malnourished children and poor sanitation.\n\nIndian economic policy after independence was influenced by the colonial experience (which was seen by Indian leaders as exploitative in nature) and by those leaders' exposure to Fabian socialism. Policy tended towards protectionism, with a strong emphasis on import substitution industrialization under state monitoring, state intervention at the micro level in all businesses especially in labour and financial markets, a large public sector, business regulation, and central planning. Five-Year Plans of India resembled central planning in the Soviet Union. Steel, mining, machine tools, water, telecommunications, insurance, and electrical plants, among other industries, were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s. Elaborate licences, regulations and the accompanying red tape, commonly referred to as Licence Raj, were required to set up business in India between 1947 and 1990.\n\nAttempts were made to liberalise the economy in 1966 and 1985. The first attempt was reversed in 1967. Thereafter, a stronger version of socialism was adopted. The second major attempt was in 1985 by prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. The process came to a halt in 1987, though a 1967 style reversal did not take place.\n\nIn the 80s, the government led by Rajiv Gandhi started light reforms. The government slightly reduced Licence Raj and also promoted the growth of the telecommunications and software industries.\n\nThe Chandra Shekhar Singh government (1990–1991) took several significant steps towards the much needed reforms and laid its foundation.\n\n\nThe fruits of liberalisation reached their peak in 2006, when India recorded its highest GDP growth rate of 9.6%. With this, India became the second fastest growing major economy in the world, next only to China. The growth rate has slowed significantly in the first half of 2012. An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report states that the average growth rate 7.5% will double the average income in a decade, and more reforms would speed up the pace. The economy then rebounded to 7.3% growth in 2014–15.\n\nBy 1991, India still had a fixed exchange rate system, where the rupee was pegged to the value of a basket of currencies of major trading partners. India started having balance of payments problems since 1985, and by the end of 1990, the state of India was in a serious economic crisis. The government was close to default, its central bank had refused new credit and foreign exchange reserves had reduced to the point that India could barely finance three weeks’ worth of imports. It had to pledge 20 tonnes of gold to Union Bank of Switzerland and 47 tonnes to Bank of England as part of a bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Most of the economic reforms were forced upon India as a part of the IMF bailout.\n\nIn response, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, along with his finance minister Manmohan Singh, initiated the economic liberalisation of 1991. The reforms did away with the Licence Raj, reduced tariffs and interest rates and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of foreign direct investment in many sectors. Since then, the overall thrust of liberalisation has remained the same, although no government has tried to take on powerful lobbies such as trade unions and farmers, on contentious issues such as reforming labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies. By the turn of the 21st century, India had progressed towards a free-market economy, with a substantial reduction in state control of the economy and increased financial liberalisation. This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates and food security, although urban residents have benefited more than rural residents. \n\nOn 12 November 1991, based on an application from the Government of India, World Bank sanctioned a structural adjustment loan / credit that consisted of two components - an IBRD loan of $250 million to be paid over 20 years, and an IDA credit of SDR 183.8 million (equivalent to $250 million) with 35 years maturity, through India's ministry of finance, with the President of India as the borrower. The loan was meant primarily to support the government's program of stabilization and economic reform. This specified deregulation, increased foreign direct investment, liberalization of the trade regime, reforming domestic interest rates, strengthening capital markets (stock exchanges), and initiating public enterprise reform (selling off public enterprises).\n\n\nThe economic liberalization of India had a multitude of impacts, some of which were positive and others negative for its people. The foreign investment in the country (including foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and investment raised on international capital markets]) increased from a minuscule US$132 million in 1991–92 to $5.3 billion in 1995–96. On the other hand, it also enabled a number of companies like Enron to invest more easily in India, in over expensive projects. As per the US Senate, the largest share of foreign direct investment in India since 1992 came from Enron (more than 10%). \n\nHowever, financial institutions applauded it:\n\nElection of AB Vajpayee as Prime Minister of India in 1998 and his agenda was seen as a welcome change by some. His prescription to speed up economic progress included solution of all outstanding problems with the West (Cold War related) and then opening gates for FDI investment. In three years, the West was developing a bit of a fascination to India's brainpower, powered by IT and BPO. By 2004, the West would consider investment in India, should the conditions permit. By the end of Vajpayee's term as prime minister, a framework for the foreign investment had been established. The new incoming government of Dr. Manmohan Singh in 2004 further strengthened the required infrastructure to welcome the FDI.\n\nToday, fascination with India is translating into active consideration of India as a destination for FDI. A study by A T Kearney named India as the second most likely destination for FDI in 2005 after China. It has displaced US to the third position. This is a great leap forward. India was at the 15th position, only a few years back. To quote the A T Kearney Study, \"India's strong performance among manufacturing and telecom & utility firms was driven largely by their desire to make productivity-enhancing investments in IT, business process outsourcing, research and development, and knowledge management activities\".\n\nFor 2010, India was ranked 124th among 179 countries in Index of Economic Freedom World Rankings, which is an improvement from the preceding year.\n\nOECD summarised the key reforms that are needed:\nThough recently labour law reforms have been enacted at the state level\n\nAccording to an OECD survey of the Indian economy states that had more liberal regulatory regimes had better economic performance. The survey also concluded that were complementary measures for better delivery of infrastructure, education and basic services implemented, they would boost employment creation and poverty reduction.\n\n\n"}

It consists of two cratons separated by the Limpopo Belt: the larger Kaapvaal Craton to the south and the smaller Zimbabwe Craton to the north. The Namaqua Belt is the southern margin of the Kaapvaal Craton.\n\nParts of the Kalahari Craton are now located in East (the Grunehogna Craton) and West Antarctica (Haag Nunataks) and the Falkland Islands.\nThe name was first introduced by .\n\nFollowing a terminology introduced in 2008, the Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic core of the craton is called the Proto-Kalahari Craton. This core plus accreted Mesoproterozoic crust and dispersed non-African fragments compose the Kalahari Craton. Before the Pan-African Orogeny, the Kalahari Craton was much larger than it is today, but its sutures and therefore its extent are difficult to locate due to later overprinting.\n\nThe Kaapvaal Craton, Zimbabwe Craton, and Limpopo Belt are made of Archaean terranes and contain crust at least 3.2  and are underlain by a thick () layer of buoyant mantle that is producing garnets and diamonds.\n\nDuring the Palaeoproterozoic the northwest margin of the Archaean core grew by accretion and had formed a Proto-Kalahari Craton by 1.75 Ga.\nDuring the period 1.4–1.0 Ga subduction occurred along the northwest margin followed by continental collisions along the eastern and southern margins. By this time enough Mesoproterozoic crust had accreted to transform the Kalahari Craton. At 1.11 Ga, during the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia, the Kalahari Craton was affected by the Umkondo-Borg Large Igneous Province.\nAt 1.15–.98 Ga the Kalahari Craton collided with the eastern margin of Laurentia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48424639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48424639", "title": "Kekri (harvest festival)", "text": "Kekri (harvest festival)\n\nKekri, also known as \"Keyri\", \"Köyri\", \"Köyry\" (in Torne Valley) and \"Kööri\", is an old annual Finnish society-fashioned harvest festival, celebrated in the fall. The recognition and celebrations of Kekri were stronger when Finland was still an agricultural society, and prior to the modern Christmas culture and traditions being embedded in the Finnish society. Historically, Kekri has also referred to a god. \n\nOriginally, the celebration of Kekri was not tied to a permanent calendar date, but – instead – was determined by the ongoing year's agricultural autumn activities. However, by the early 1800s its date stabilized at the All Saints' Day, i.e. in the beginning of November.\n\nIn various Finnish dialects and in vernacular language, the term kekri and its cognates have been used to refer to the last thing left, residue, remnant and/or end of something, most commonly – and possibly originally – the harvest season. Historically, Kekri was a god that protected cattle. The term has also been used in reference to leprechaun/fairy, scare and scarecrow. \n\nIn his listing of Finnish gods in 1551, the Finnish author Mikael Agricola defined Kekri as a god that enhances the growth of livestock: \"Käkri se liseis Carjan casvon\". In his study 'Mythologica fennica' in 1789, Cristfried Ganander stated the same about Kekri, and added that the term Kekri also refers to the celebration of the end of the harvest season.\n\nThe remembrance of the dead is a similarity between the traditional celebrations of Kekri and Halloween. In the Finnic tradition of the past, each family invited their dead to their Kekri feasts, making a part of Kekri formal and serious. The second day of Kekri – however – has traditionally been more relaxed, similar in this respect to Boxing Day in the widespread modern Western Christmas tradition. In the second day of Kekri, especially in the old times, people have visited family and friends, dressed up as various types of Kekri characters. These Kekri characters of the past are commonly viewed as predecessors of the modern-day Santa Claus.\n\nTraditionally, the end of the harvest season in Kekri has been celebrated with abundant feasts, which often have included lamb roast as one of the courses served. Various kinds of magic, spells, beliefs and myths too have also been an important part of old Kekri traditions, as well as bonfires, especially in certain parts of Finland.\n\nKekri traditions began to disappear in Finland with the industrialization and urbanization of the Finnish society. Many customs and traditions associated with Kekri have since been transferred to the modern Christmas and New Year celebrations. \n\nSome ancient Kekri traditions have remained the longest in Eastern Finland. Today, Kekri is celebrated annually in the Eastern Finnish city of Kajaani by the burning of the so-called \"Kekri goat\" (Finnish: Kekripukki), built in the recent times normally by local actors and other players. The incineration of the Kekri goat is usually linked to other program and activities, such as dance and musical performances, street market, feast, etc. \n\nKekri is celebrated also in other parts of Finland, for instance in the Southern Finnish island of Suomenlinna, where various events are prepared annually in honor of Kekri. The celebrations typically have included abundant feasts, with lamb roast traditionally being part of the menu. \n\nAlthough the Celtic-originated Halloween has gradually begun to penetrate into the Finnish autumn feast traditions from the United States, Kekri has held its ground. In part due to the celebrations of Halloween having become increasingly commercial, many Finns prefer not to have it associated with Kekri or the All Saints' Day (Finnish: Pyhäinpäivä).\n"}

In a March 2014 article she divided these parties into four groups: \"parties [that] gain support via an ambivalent relationship with fascist and Nazi pasts\" (e.g., in Austria, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and France), parties that \"focus primarily on a perceived threat from Islam\" (e.g., in the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland), parties that \"restrict their propaganda to a perceived threat to their national identities from ethnic minorities\" (e.g., in Hungary, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom) and parties that \"endorse a fundamentalist Christian conservative-reactionary agenda\" (e.g., in Poland, Romania and Bulgaria). According to \"the Economist\", the main attraction of far-right parties in the Scandinavian countries is the national culture is under threat.\n\nDifferent parts of Europe have nationalist parties with different ideologies and goals. Most nationalist parties in Central and Western Europe are described as \"right-wing populists\". According to Thomas Klau of the European Council on Foreign Relations \"as antisemitism was a unifying factor for far-right parties in the 1910s, 20s and 30s, Islamophobia has become the unifying factor in the early decades of the 21st century.\" Many are Left Wing or Civic Nationalist Parties, which often advocate regionalism.\n\nNationalist parties are the ruling party in the Republic of Macedonia the VMRO-DPMNE is one of the two major parties in the country. Switzerland is also ruled by a nationalist party by the Swiss People's Party.\n\nIn all other countries, nationalist parties are in opposition. In some countries, nationalist parties are major players in politics, such as France's National Rally, Finland's True Finns, Estonia's Conservative People's Party, Italy's Lega Nord, Austria's Freedom Party of Austria Hungary's Jobbik, Turkey's MHP, Greece's Golden Dawn , Armenia's Armenian Revolutionary Federation, the United Kingdom's UK Independence Party, Poland's Law and Justice, Slovakia's Slovak National Party, Denmark's Danish People's Party etc.\n\nMost, if not all, nationalist parties represented in the European Parliament are in the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group.\n\nNationalist parties in the Eastern European states differ from the ones in Western Europe mostly by the fact that there is virtually no immigration into these countries.\n\nGovernments in Belarus and Azerbaijan are often considered totalitarian and elections in these countries have been described unfair and not free and thus the parliaments are effectively controlled by the ruling party.\n\nSlovenia held its Parliamentary Elections to the National Assembly of Slovenia on the 3rd June, 2018, where 90 members were elected. The Slovenian National Party and Slovenian Democratic Party are the country's two nationalist, far-rightist parties and both gained seats under this election. The Slovenian Democratic Party is the largest party by seats in the National Assembly with 25, while the Slovenian National Party is the smallest party with 4. Thus 29 seats are held by nationalist parties, up 8 seats from the last elections in 2014. A new Government has yet to be formed, though in any case there will be a strong nationalist sentiment in the Assembly. \n\nThe United Kingdom held Local Elections on the 3rd of May for around a quarter of local government seats in England. The United Kingdom Independence Party lost 103 seats during this round of elections, showing a decline in support for local government-level nationalism in the country after the Brexit referendum of 2016.\n\nHungary held its General Parliamentary Elections on the 8th April 2018, where 199 seats in the National Assembly of Hungary were filled. Two nationalist parties, all far-right, emerged with seats in the new Assembly, with the new Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, being from the Fidesz-Christian Democratic People's Party. His party gained 133 seats, while the Jobbik-Movement for a Better Hungary Party gained 26 seats. This put 159 out of 199 seats in the Hungarian National Assembly under the control of nationalist parties, up 3 seats from the last election in 2014.\n\nItaly held its General Elections on the 4th March, 2018, where 630 Deputies were elected to the Lower House and 315 Senators to the Upper House of the Italian Parliament. Italy's largest far-right party, the Lega Nord or \"League\" secured 125 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House) and 58 seats in the Senate (Upper House). The Brothers of Italy, another nationalist party, gained 32 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 18 seats in the Senate. Italy's Five Star Movement (M5S) have also been labelled as being in the far-right. Gaining 222 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 109 seats in the Senate, that would make M5S the largest far-right group in Italy, though arguably, they are not officially a far-right group. The current government, formed with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte as its head, supported by parties including the League, the Brothers of Italy and M5S, which together contribute 379 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 185 seats in the Senate. A large portion of the Italian Government is therefore far-rightist and/or nationalist. Between them, the three parties went up by 140 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and by 20 seats in the Senate compared to the last election in 2013. \n\n\nParty of the Danes (2011–2017)\n\n\n\n"}

The Act has two essential aims: to regulate intentional ocean disposal of materials, and to authorize any related research. While the MPRSA regulates the ocean dumping of waste and provides for a research program on ocean dumping, it also provides for the designation and regulation of marine sanctuaries. The act regulates the ocean dumping of all material beyond the territorial limit ( from shore) and prevents or strictly limits dumping material that \"would adversely affect human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities\". The MPRSA authorized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate ocean dumping of materials including, but not limited to, industrial waste, sewage sludge, biological agents, radioactive agents, NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical), garbage, chemicals, and biological and laboratory, as well as other wastes, into the territorial waters of the United States through a permit program. The EPA can issue permits for dumping of materials other than dredge spoils if the agency determines, through a full public notice and process, that the discharge will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health or welfare or the marine environment. The law also has provisions related to creating marine sanctuaries, conducting ocean disposal research and monitoring coastal water quality.\n\nThere are four federal agencies that share responsibilities under the Ocean Dumping Act:\n\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the primary agency that is in charge of regulating the disposal of all substances that are disposed in the ocean; this agency also authorize the research and demonstration of activities that have to do with phasing out sewage and industrial waste disposing. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers agency is in charge of dredged spoils. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is in charge of the research on the changes of the marine environment that are caused by humans. The U.S. Coast Guard is in charge of the surveillance of ocean dumping.\n\nThe NOAA National Marine Sanctuary program manages a network of underwater areas that are protected by the US. These special bodies of water, like oceans and lakes, are protected by Congress to keep natural and cultural resources while allowing people to enjoy the waters. The Marine Protection, Research, Sanctuaries Act gives way for a national network of marine sanctuaries that are administered by NOAA. The NOAA was created in 1970 after an oil spill 30 miles of the coast of California released 235,000 gallons of crude oil into the ocean. As time passes and technology advances, the NOAA has added sanctuaries all over the US. Three sites followed from 1992, with Congress designating Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary in Massachusetts and Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in California.\n\nTitle I of the MPRSA prohibits all ocean dumping, except that allowed by permits issued by the EPA Administrator pursuant to Section 102 of the MPRSA, in any ocean waters under U.S. jurisdiction, by any U.S. vessel, or by any vessel sailing from a U.S. port. EPA designates sites for ocean dumping and specifies in each permit where the material is to be disposed.\n\nIn 1973, the EPA permitted two interim chemical disposal sites in the Gulf of Mexico, as described in the report, Assessing Potential Ocean Pollutants, published by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS, 1975) https://books.google.com/books/about/Assessing_Potential_Ocean_Pollutants.html?id=eicQOgkswusC. At Site A, uncontained wastes were discharged through a submerged pipe into the turbulent wake of a barge. At Site B, waste materials were placed in barrels before discharge. Chemical wastes discharged at these sites reportedly had various concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons, calcium and sodium metals, formaldehyde, cyanide and other metals (i.e. antimony, mercury, arsenic, zinc, manganese, and iron). Seven permits issued by the EPA in 1973 for the period of May 1 to November 1 allowed for the disposal of 84,500 tons of uncontained waste at Site A and 208,500 waste barrels at Site B, of which 55,000 barrels contained chlorinated hydrocarbons. By July 1973, four companies with plants at 7 locations were using Sites A and B (NAS, 1975).\n\nNearly all of the ocean dumping that takes place today is dredged materials at the hands of the Corps of Engineers and due to the fact that they are the entity primarily responsible for the dredging, they issue permits for ocean dumping of such materials. The dredged materials are sediments removed from the bottom of water bodies, but before they are dumped in the ocean, they must be evaluated to ensure that they are not harmful to human health or to the marine environment.\n\nThe basic objective of the permit program is to \"prevent or strictly limit the dumping into ocean waters of any material that would adversely affect human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecosystems, or economic potentialities.\" The Secretary of the Army (through the Corps of Engineers) is authorized to issue permits for dredged material disposal, and EPA is authorized to designate appropriate dump sites.\n\nDumping restrictions were enacted for both U.S. flag vessels and materials transported from a location outside the U.S. With respect to the latter category, dumping was prohibited within the U.S. territorial sea and the U.S. contiguous zone. A specific dumping prohibition was included for radiological, chemical and biological warfare agents, high-level radioactive waste and medical wastes. Restrictions have since been placed on dumping activities in the New York Bight Apex, and sewage sludge dumping at the \"106-Mile Site\" offshore of New Jersey ended in 1992.\n\nIn order for anyone to dump on US waters, they must follow certain laws. Public Law 97-424, enacted in 1983, placed a 2-year prohibition on ocean dumping of any low-level radioactive waste. Public Law 100-688 terminated the dumping of sewage sludge and waste from industrial companies (commencing with the 270th day after November 18, 1988) under certain conditions. After December 31, 1991, it was prohibited to dump any type of sewage sludge and industrial waste. This law gives EPA the authority to issue emergency permits for the dumping of industrial waste into ocean waters if an unacceptable human health risk exists and no other alternative is available.\n\nTitle II of the Act authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)) to coordinate a research and monitoring program with the EPA and the United States Coast Guard. The NOAA conducts general research on ocean resources and is responsible for research on the effects of ocean dumping, pollution, overfishing, and other issues caused by humans that cause changes in the marine ecosystem. The EPA's research is related to the phasing out of ocean disposal activities and its role includes conducting research, surveys, investigations, experiments, training, demonstrations, and studies to aid in their search for dumping alternatives.\n\nStatutes providing authority for appropriations were enacted in 1972, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1980, 1986 and 1988. Public Law 100-627 authorized appropriations of $13.5 million for Title II for Fiscal Year 1989, and $14.5 million for Fiscal Year 1990.\n\nTitle III allows the Secretary of Commerce to designate discrete areas as National Marine Sanctuaries after conferring with the heads of involved federal agencies and state and local governments, as appropriate. The establishment of these sanctuaries is important in helping to promote comprehensive management of their special conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, research, educational, or aesthetic resources. The importance and primary objective of a sanctuary is to protect its features and allow the ocean to be used in a natural and sustainable way. Sanctuaries provide a safe haven for endangered species, or those close to extinction, while also serving educational purposes for students and researchers alike to promote understanding and stewardship of our oceans.\n\nPublic Law 96-332 provides that any marine sanctuary designation will not be effective if the Governor of an affected state finds it unacceptable, or if Congress form a concurrent of dissproval (must occur within 60 days). The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to withdraw the designation after any such State or Congressional disapproval. If the designation is not withdrawn, only the portion certified as acceptable can take effect.\n\nTitle IV of the MPRSA established nine regional marine research boards for the purpose of developing comprehensive marine research plans, considering water quality and ecosystem conditions and research and monitoring priorities and objectives in each region. The plans, after approval by the NOAA and EPA, are to guide NOAA in awarding research grants funds under this title of the act. The Regional Marine Research Act was enacted in recognition of the value of the Nation's coastal marine waters and the need for regional research to safeguard their quality and health. The main focus of this program is to establish regional marine research programs around the country and to provide sustained federal funding for planned research within each region.\nFive Major Sections of the Gulf of Maine Regional Marine Research Program:\n1. An overview of marine environmental quality in the region.\n2. An inventory of current research activities.\n3. A statement of the research needs and priorities within the context of a 10-year goal.\n4. An assessment of how the plan will incorporate existing research and management in the region\n5. A description and schedule of the research objectives for the region during the 4-year period covered by the plan.\n\nTitle V launched a national coastal water quality monitoring program that directs the EPA and NOAA together to implement a long-term program to collect and analyze scientific data on the environmental quality of coastal ecosystems, including ambient water quality, health and quality of living resources, sources of environmental degradation, and data on trends. Results of these actions are used to provide the information required to devise and execute effective programs under the Clean Water Act and Coastal Zone Management Act.\n\nIn 1977, Congress amended the Act to require that dumping of municipal sewage sludge or industrial wastes, which unreasonably degrade the environment, to cease by December 1981. Because that deadline was not achieved, amendments were passed in 1988 that extended the deadline to December 1991. In 1986 amendments, Congress directed that ocean disposal of all wastes end at the traditional 12-mile site off the New York/New Jersey coast and that they be moved to a new site 106 miles offshore. Congress amended the Act again in 1992, giving permission to states to adopt ocean dumping standards more stringent than federal standards and to require that permits conform with long-term management plans for designated dumpsites. This amendment was put into place to ensure that permitted activities are consistent with expected uses of the site.\n\nThe violation of a permit or permit requirement carries a civil penalty of not more than $75,000 per violation that is assessed by the EPA. The organization is also authorized to assess criminal penalties that carry fines up to $250,000, 5 years in prison, or both for violations of the act. Additionally, fines are assessed for ocean dumping of medical wastes that carry the same penalties previously listed. Like many other federal environmental laws, the Ocean Dumping Act allows individuals to bring a citizen suit in U.S. district court against any person, including the United States, for violation of a permit or other prohibition, limitation, or criterion issued under title I of the Act.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, each of the states is permitted to regulate ocean dumping in waters within their own jurisdiction. The Ocean Dumping Act requires that the EPA Administrator applies the standards and criteria binding upon the United States that are stated in the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters. During this convention, more than 85 countries agreed in the prohibition of dumping in the ocean the next elements: mercury, cadmium and other substances such as DDT and PCBs, solid wastes and persistent plastics, oil, high-level radioactive wastes, and chemical and biological warfare agents; and requires special permits for other heavy metals, cyanides and fluorides, and medium- and low-level radioactive wastes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1918420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918420", "title": "NBC Europe", "text": "NBC Europe\n\nNBC Europe (formerly Super Channel and NBC Super Channel) was a satellite television channel based in the United Kingdom that broadcast across Europe. It was picked up by various European cable television networks.\n\nLaunched on 30 January 1987, replacing 24-hour music channel Music Box, Super Channel was co-owned by all but one of the ITV companies at the time in the United Kingdom. Virgin Group had a majority stake in Music Box (60%) and would own 15% of the equity with the rest being split between ITV franchise holders including Granada, Yorkshire, LWT, Central, Anglia, Tyne Tees, Ulster, Grampian, Scottish, and Border Television. Thames Television was the only one of the ITV contractors not to participate. It competed with Sky Channel, forerunner of Sky1, which was the only other major pan-European satellite-channel around at the time. Unlike Sky Channel, Super Channel's syndicated output was less American and more European. Many of the programmes were what it called the \"Best of British\", sourced from ITV or the BBC, while ITN produced news bulletins (\"see also ITN World News\"). It also broadcast syndicated non-British European programmes such as the Dutch sitcom \"Zeg 'ns Aaa\" (with English subtitles).\n\nSuper Channel fared poorly, due to UK programming seen as unsuitable for European audiences, such as drama being seen as \"too violent\" or \"too realistic\", as well as a dispute with the British actors unions who demanded additional fees for viewing by European audiences which meant that it could no longer offer the 'Best of British to a European audience'. \n\nWithin a year, the ITV companies sold the channel to the Italian Marcucci family, owners of Videomusic, the first music channel in Italy, with a minority stake being held by Richard Branson's Virgin plc, and the programming changed from British to pan-European, although it continued carrying ITN's World News bulletins.\n\nAt the beginning Super Channel was based in the heart of London, 19-22 Rathbone Place, London W1P 1DF, in the same building as Music Box; the building would later become the home of CNN International until 2007. For a number of months the channel's transmission facilities were provided by Molinare at Fouberts Place, London W1 until the Marcucci family acquired Melrose House, 14 Lanark Square, in Limeharbour (London) where it set up a state of the art transmission facility.\n\nIn 1996 the channel (along with its sister channel CNBC Europe) was transmitted from the GE building in Hammersmith, London. The transmission suite used cutting edge (at the time) Pro-Bel COMPASS and MAPP automation, and Profile video servers for all commercials and promotions. Programmes continued to be played from tape, however.\n\nIn 1993, the station was having financial difficulties, and was taken over by the American company General Electric, then-parent of the NBC television network, and became NBC Super Channel. In 1996, the channel was renamed NBC Europe, but was, from then on, almost always referred to as simply \"NBC\" on the air.\n\nMost of NBC Europe's prime time programming was produced in Europe, but after 10 pm Central European Time on weekday evenings, the channel aired \"The Tonight Show\", \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", and \"Later\", hence its slogan \"Where the Stars Come Out at Night.\" Most NBC News programs were broadcast on NBC Europe, including \"Dateline NBC\", \"Time and Again\" and \"NBC Nightly News\", which was aired live. \"The Today Show\" was also initially shown live in the afternoons, but was later broadcast the following morning instead, by which time it was more than half a day old. That meant that all news portions had to be replaced with European updates produced by ITN in London. ITN also supplied the network with the main European newscasts before and after the GE takeover. The European weather was produced by the BBC at first, but was later taken over by NBC in the U.S.\n\nNBC Europe carried virtually no prime time fiction entertainment programs shown on NBC in the US, because they were usually owned and distributed by other studios under the fin-syn rules (which did not apply for Europe). NBC would have had to buy the rights for each country in order to show them on NBC Europe, which would have been too expensive. Even for shows that NBC Studios owned itself, it was generally more financially viable to sell the rights country by country either to broadcast or cable/satellite channels than to air them on NBC Europe. The most notable exceptions to this rule were brief runs of \"Profiler\" and \"The Pretender\", as well as short-lived US sitcoms \"Union Square\" and \"Mr. Rhodes\". That is widely considered to be one of the main reasons why NBC Europe was ultimately not a success.\n\nNBC Europe stopped broadcasting to most of Europe in 1998, when the DFA (Deutsche Fernsehnachrichten Agentur) took it over and moved it to Düsseldorf. Most of the satellite feeds of NBC Europe became either National Geographic or CNBC. NBC Europe continued to operate on the German cable TV, fed by one digital satellite link from Eutelsat II-F1 (later Hotbird 5). In November 1998 the first German programming started airing. Programming was assembled with content from GIGA and CNBC Europe, as well as other shows. In 2004, NBC Universal took over the DFA and consequently NBC Europe.\n\nOn 29 September 2005 NBC Europe was split into GIGA and the new channel Das Vierte. NBC Europe was replaced by Das Vierte. In fact Das Vierte is still broadcasting with the licence of NBC Europe on cable TV; on satellite, IPTV and digital cable it is a new channel. Das Vierte broadcasts a special version on cable TV, including CNBC Europe, and from 29 September 2005 to 31 March 2006, also GIGA. This is necessary to keep the licence and the cable channel.\n\nDue to limitations on the amount of entertainment programming on the network, \"NBC Europe\" aired a number of original programming in tandem with American programming that had not been aired in Europe beforehand. These programmes include:\n\n\n"}

Guglielmo Marconi, the man who invented radio, oversaw the construction of the first short-wave transmitter at Prato Smeraldo outside Rome on July 1, 1930. Four years later two more transmitters were completed and broadcasts began in English and Italian to North America. In 1935 broadcasting of programmes in Italian, Portuguese and Spanish began to South America.\n\nIn 1939, after the completion of six new transmitters, programmes in English were beamed to the Far East, Europe and countries around the Mediterranean. It is from the short-wave radio centre at Rome-Prato Smeraldo that all Rai International's programmes are broadcast.\n\nDuring the Second World War political and strategic motives were added to the original aim of linking Italy with the vast community of Italian migrants around the world. These new motives included international broadcasting common to all the Great Powers, beginning with the former colonial nations: France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union and the United States. After Italy entered the war short-wave broadcasts were suspended following the armistice signed with the Allies on September 8, 1943, and were only resumed on September 3, 1946, with the broadcast of news bulletins in English, Italian, French, Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nA 1962 law allocated management of international short-wave broadcasts, for which a special committee of the Cabinet Office is responsible, to state broadcaster Rai. As the years went by the programmes lost their character of official - sometimes even propaganda - broadcasts to become a news source that fully reflects the democratic nature of the Italian Republic. Up to the last broadcast, Radio Roma offered a comprehensive news service on Italian politics, society and culture, not least within the context of the European Union.\n\nIn 1975 the setting up of a special management section for foreign broadcasting and journalism laid the foundations for significant development of the sector. Subsequently the existing services for foreign broadcasting were expanded to include Rai International's new intercontinental television channels. In the near future Rai International is destined to be transformed into an autonomous company within state broadcaster Rai.\n\nEach day Rai Internazionale's editorial team turned out ten editions of \"Italia chiama Italia News\" in Italian: this 25-minute news programme was designed for Italian listeners throughout the world. \n\nThe editorial team also produced \"Racconto Italiano\", \"Taccuino Italiano\", \"Tutto di Prima\" and \"Storia e Storie\".\n\nIn many countries it was possible to receive several Rai Internazionale programmes or the entire programme schedule of Rai Internazionale through local radio stations that re-transmit the signal in their own zone, on AM, FM, short wave or via cable.\n\nOn October 1, 2007, all broadcasts on short wave were discontinued and foreign language services were closed. On December 31, 2011 Rai Internazionale Radio closed down its operations.\n\nEnglish news items were transmitted as part of \"Notturno Italiano\" programme on medium wave until December 31, 2011.\n\nRai Internazionale Radio transmitted its channel online and on satellite, 24 hours a day. Thus the radio and news programmes produced by RAI were available worldwide without any special technical devices (apart from a computer and Internet connection).\n\nRai Internazionale Radio has broadcast the best of Rai International Radio and the three Radio Rai networks daily, 24 hours a day. This included music, information and entertainment programmes until it closed down on December 31, 2011.\n\n\n"}
