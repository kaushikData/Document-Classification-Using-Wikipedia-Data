{"id": "31797370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31797370", "title": "Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs", "text": "Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs\n\nThe Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs is a constituent of the College of Asia and the Pacific, but was formerly part of the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, ANU, which was founded in 1946 as part of the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. In 2015 it was renamed in honour of Coral Bell, a leading Australian scholar of international politics.\n\nFirst known as the Research School for Pacific Studies (RSPacS), the research school began as one of the foundation schools\nof the Institute of Advanced Studies at ANU. In the late 1940s Raymond Firth, an eminent international scholar from the London School of Economics, was asked to join a group of other academics to advise on the creation of the first research schools within the ANU. Other leading scholars in the group included Mark Oliphant (physical sciences), Keith Hancock (social sciences), and Nobel prize-winner Howard Florey (medical sciences). Firth was responsible for advising on regional studies, especially Pacific studies. Following the recommendations of this group, a number of research schools were established at the ANU to serve as national centres of study in Australia in the post-war period.\n\nDuring the next several decades the RSPacS built up a strong international reputation for work on Pacific studies (including Papua New Guinea) and Southeast Asia. The first Director and first professor of economics in the RSPacS was Sir John Crawford. Crawford's interests in development in Asia set a direction for economics in the research school. He was also widely recognised as an excellent academic administrator who served as both Vice-Chancellor, and later Chancellor, of the ANU. The work of the research school during this period was strongly interdisciplinary. For example, as well as research in economics, international relations, human geography and anthropology in the Asia-Pacific region, another major development of the school was the creation of the \"Pacific Linguistics\" publishing unit by Professor Stephen Wurm in the early 1960s. Since the establishment of the unit, \"Pacific Linguistics\" has published several hundred volumes of dictionaries, grammars, and other linguistic studies on the Asia-Pacific region, particularly Oceania and Southeast Asia.\n\nIn the earlier form of the research school, staff of the RSPacS were frequently involved in public discussion about Pacific and Asian affairs Also the genesis of the RSPAS can be seen in comments by Bruce in 1952 Due to the earlier focus on Pacific studies, the RSPacS supported research locations with housing for visiting researchers; the Suva Flats in Fiji were one such location\n\nFor a range of reasons, including significant changes in the balance of power in Southeast Asia in the late 1960s and the following decade, during the 1970s and 1980s there was a decline in Asian regional studies in Europe and North America. Partly as a result, many scholars from North America and Europe with an interest in Asia spent time at the ANU to work within the RSPacS. Well-known scholars from North America who visited the school in the 1970s and 1980s included Professor Bruce Glassburner (economics, University of California, Davis), Professor Anne Krueger (later the chief economist of the World Bank and first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund), Professor Herb Grubel (Simon Fraser University, Canada), and many others.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s an increasing proportion of the work of the school shifted to Southeast Asia from the Pacific. Many scholarly books, journal articles and other studies were produced following research in countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and so on. Reflecting the fact that \"the balance of research activity in the School... has shifted significantly from the Pacific towards Asia in recent years and will continue to do so\", in 1994 the name of the school was changed to the Research School of Pacific \"and Asian\" Studies (RSPAS) RSPAS developed along multidisciplinary lines, encompassing anthropology, archaeology, economics, history, human geography, international relations, linguistics, political science, resource management and strategic defence studies. Over time, within the overall departmental structure of the school, certain special areas of study emerged such as the Indonesia Project which focused on studies of the Indonesian economy as well as other aspects of developments in Indonesia.\n\nAt various stages internal ANU and external factors affected the school – such as in 1997 when it was announced that the school was required to reduce staff numbers\n\nIn 2010, following a major review of the organisational arrangements within the ANU, the RSPAS was reduced in status in line with other changes to other research schools across the ANU. Shortly afterwards, a new \"College of Asia and the Pacific\" was established which took over much of the work of former RSPAS.\nThe Bell School consists of seven departments or centres.\nThe Bell School offers one undergraduate and six postgraduate coursework programs.\n\nUndergraduate Program\nPostgraduate Programs\n\nThe School also contributes undergraduate and graduate courses in International Relations, security studies, strategic studies, political science, political and social change and Asia and the Pacific studies.\nThe Bell School offers graduate research programs. Students undertake their research at one of the School's departments or centres and are awarded Master of Philosophy or Doctor of Philosophy degrees when they complete their studies.\nDuring its existence, scholars from the RSPacS and RSPAS produced a large number of books and journal articles as well as various other publications that reported on its work and subjects within its scope For example, one of the major achievements of the research school was the establishment of the \"Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies\" by Professor Heinz Arndt in the mid-1960s. Now in publication for over 40 years, the \"Bulletin\" has documented the development of the Indonesian economy and is today the leading international journal dealing with the economic development of Indonesia.\n\nOther work on the region included support for the major annual \"Indonesia Update\" conference in Canberra where Australian and overseas experts discussed the state of development in Indonesia. The \"Update\" conference, which is now organised within the College of Asia and the Pacific, leads to the publication of a conference volume. During the 1980s and 1990s, the RSPAS was joint publisher of the conference volume in cooperation with the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.\n\nThe number of linked publication series of the staff RSPAS is of considerable size covering its scope – with publications relating to Australian, Pacific, and Asian subjects However following the change in arrangements in the ANU in 2010, some projects effectively closed down.\n\nPandanus Books was a publishing arm of RSPAS which produced a range of significant publications relative to south east Asian studies, it was wound down in 2006\n\nA significant presence for the RSPAS on the internet was the RSPAS-based work \"Asian Studies WWW Monitor\" supported by Dr T.Matthew Ciolek. The \"Monitor\" was established in April 1994 and operated until January 2011. Later, the \"Pacific Studies WWW Monitor\" (ISSN 1443-8976) modelled on the Asian Studies monitor was established in April 2000.\n\nSubject areas of the conferences that RSPAS conducted or shared with other bodies were extensive in their coverage of Pacific and Asian areas of interest to Australia, this also subsequently attracted researchers with experience who would go on to work in Australian government agencies or authorities, or otherwise government would co-opt RSPAS staff onto their bodies. Of significance of the government relationship between RSPAS and the government is the title of the doctoral these by van Konkelenberg who wrote about \"The relationship between the Australian National University's Research School of Pacific Studies and the federal government 1946–1975.\n\nThe various divisions or sections within RSPAS had collections of materials in relation to the study areas that were on a par or complementary with that held by the National Library of Australia\n\nFor much of its history, the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies was housed in the Coombs Building, a notable architectural icon on the ANU campus. The building, named after leading Australian economist H.C. Coombs, was inaugurated on 11 September 1964. A set of interlinked hexagons –- originally two, with third added later, together with a lecture theatre and extension—the Coombs Building was the hive in which research and teaching were carried out on the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\n\n"}

For security reasons networks with Internet and intranet access are air gapped so that computers with Internet access are not housed in the same location as computers with Kwangmyong access.\n\nGiven that there is no direct connection to the outside Internet, unwanted information cannot enter the network. Information is filtered and processed by government agencies before being hosted on the North Korean Intranet. Burma and Cuba also use a similar network system that is separated from the rest of the Internet, and Iran has been reported as having future plans to implement such a network, though it's claimed that it would work alongside the Internet and wouldn't replace it.\n\n\n"}

It was very popular in Africa .\n\nThe dance was popularized by soukous music videos, as well as the videos of Kanda Bongo Man, Pepe Kalle, Viva La Musica, and other Congolese musicians. For the first time in Congo all the groups adopted these dance steps which had not happened before, because bands preferred to have their own specific dance.\n\nThe words \"kwassa kwassa\" may have come from the French \"quoi ça?\" (\"what [is] that?\").\n\nIn the 1980s, Kanda Bongo Man, a Paris-based artist, pioneered fast, short soukous tracks suitable for play on dance floors everywhere and popularly known as \"kwassa kwassa\" after the dance moves popularized by his and other artists' music videos. This music appealed to Africans and to new audiences as well. Artists like Diblo Dibala, Jeannot Bel Musumbu, Mbilia Bel, Yondo Sister, Tinderwet, Loketo, Rigo Star, Madilu System, Soukous Stars and veterans like Pepe Kalle and Koffi Olomide followed suit. Soon Paris became home to talented studio musicians who recorded for the African and Caribbean markets and filled out bands for occasional tours.\n\nA slower version of this genre has been created and popularized by Koffi Olomide and his band Quartier Latin. Their songs have enjoyed massive airplay throughout Africa in countries like Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Senegal and others. Metavo is also very popular in South Africa.\n\nThis kind of beat is referenced in the 2008 song \"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\" by American indie rock band Vampire Weekend.\n"}

When a child died that was not his own, Le-eyo said a prayer for the child to remain dead but the moon to return. When his own child died, Le-eyo said the prayer properly but it would not work. In Maasai mythology, this is the reason that when men die, they do not return, but when the moon \"dies\" it returns the next night.\n\nAnother Maasai story tells of the origin of the people. When Le-eyo was old and dying, he asked his two sons what they would like. The elder son said that he wanted something of everything in the world. Le-eyo gave him some sheep, goats and cattle. The younger son said that he wanted his father's fan. Le-eyo replied that because of his choice, he would be great and wealthy. The elder brother went on to be the ancestor of the Meek (Bantu tribes) and the younger son went on to be the ancestor of the Maasai.\n"}

May 8th, 1993) was a worker activist at an Indonesian company, PT Catur Putra Surya in Porong, East Java, whose rape and murder drew international attention to the practices of the Suharto dictatorship and the suppression of workers. Marsinah was serving as a negotiator for 500 workers striking over supplemental payments for food and transportation. On May 4th, she was kidnapped following a demonstration, her body found four days later. Those responsible have never been brought to justice, but it is widely believed that the military had a hand in her disappearance and subsequent death. \n\nThe second child of Sumini and Mastin, Marsinah grew up under the care of her grandmother, Puirah, and her aunt Sini, in Nglundo, East Java. She went to school at Karangasem Public School 189, subsequently Nganjuk No.5 Middle School. Her girlhood years were marked with commerce, selling snacks in order to augment her grandmother and aunt's incomes. Marsinah's final school years were spent at the Muhammadiyah Boarding School, her educational advancement being denied due to lack of money.\n\nUnable to find employment in Nglundo, Marsinah turned her attention to the big cities, sending in job applications to Surabaya, Mojokerto and Gresik. Hired by Bata Shoes to work at their Surabaya factory in 1989, she moved a year later to the Catur Putra Surya (formerly Empat Putra Surya) watch factory in Sidoarjo. Making a lateral transfer to their Porong factory after its opening, Marsinah eventually found herself serving as spokesperson for her fellow workers.\n\nWhen, in 1993, the Governor of East Java announced a raise in the provincial minimum wage, Catur Putra Surya (a company with ties to the Indonesian military-industrial complex) refused to comply due to the perceived potential financial losses it would cost the company. On May 3rd of that year, CPS workers went on strike while Marsinah went to the Indonesian Ministry of Labor to retrieve a copy of the gubernatorial directive to shove in the face of CPS management.\n\nOn May 5th, the Sidoarjo District Military Command summoned 13 workers to its headquarters and forced them to sign letters of resignation, with 8 more to follow in the next couple of days. Outraged by this turn of events, Marsinah decided to go there herself and demand an explanation that very same day. She was never seen alive again. \n\nShe was posthumously awarded the Yap Thiam Hien Award, and her murder was officially noted by the International Labour Organization as Case# 1773.\n\n"}

In 1948 Sassen's parents, Willem Sassen and Miep van der Voort, moved to Argentina and the family lived in Buenos Aires. Her father was a Dutch collaborator with the Nazis, a Nazi journalist and a member of the Waffen-SS. In the 1950s Willem Sassen was close to Adolf Eichmann when both were living in Argentina and she recalls him visiting her childhood home. Saskia Sassen also spent part of her youth in Italy and says she was \"brought up in five languages.\"\n\nShe is married to sociologist Richard Sennett. Artist Hilary Koob-Sassen is her son from her first marriage.\n\nFrom 1966, Sassen spent a year each at the Université de Poitiers, France, the Università degli Studi di Roma, and the University of Buenos Aires, for studies in philosophy and political science.

She studied the impacts of globalisation such as economic restructuring, and how the movements of labour and capital influence urban life. She also studied the influence of communication technology on governance. Sassen observed how nation states begin to lose power to control these developments, and she studied increasing general transnationalism, including transnational human migration. She identified and described the phenomenon of the \"global city\". Her 1991 book bearing this title made her a widely quoted author on globalisation. An updated edition of her book was published in 2001.

The station is owned and operated by iHeartMedia, Inc., the largest U.S. radio station owner. The station's studios are located in South Tampa and the transmitter site is in Town 'n' Country.\n\nWFLA began in 1925 as Clearwater radio station WGHB (1130 AM). By 1927, its call letters changed to WFLA and it moved to 590 AM. It shared the frequency with WSUN before they both moved together to 620 AM in 1929. In January 1941, WFLA moved to 940 AM, then to its present 970 AM that March.\n\nWFLA carried most of the popular network shows during the golden age of radio. From 1945 to 1949, the station carried a gospel show, which featured legendary bass singer J. D. Sumner and The Sunny South Quartet. It had various music formats over the subsequent years (top 40, middle-of-the-road, adult contemporary) before switching to news/talk in 1986. It has been the market leader in this format ever since, and usually is among the top five stations in the market, according to Arbitron ratings.\n\nAt one time, WFLA and its FM radio sister (93.3 FM, now WFLZ-FM) were owned by Media General, the parent company of \"The Tampa Tribune\" and WFLA-TV. In the 1980s, federal regulations forced Media General to divest the radio stations because of its other local media holdings. The radio stations were sold to Blair Broadcasting in late 1982. Sconnix Communications of Charleston, South Carolina, bought WFLA and what was then WPDS from Blair Broadcasting (which was divesting all of its English-language broadcasting properties to concentrate on what became today's Telemundo) in 1987, and Jacor Communications purchased WFLA from Sconnix in 1988. (Clear Channel Communications purchased Jacor in 1999 and thus acquired WFLA and WFLZ.)\n\nIn 1989, the station moved from Jackson Street in downtown Tampa to its present location at 4002 W. Gandy Blvd., in south Tampa. Another Clear Channel property in Tallahassee now uses the calls, WFLA-FM.\n\nWFLA gave national hosts Glenn Beck and Lionel their starts in talk radio. Other prominent alumni, from the days when the station concentrated on local programming, include Bob Lassiter (d. 2006), Jay Marvin, Dick Norman (d. 1989), Chuck Harder, Jack Ellery and Freddy Mertz. Other former hosts include Al Gardner, Mark Larsen, Daniel Ruth, Mark Beiro, Paul Gonzalez and Mel Berman (d. 2010).\n\nThe station's local morning show, \"AM Tampa Bay\", is hosted by broadcasters Jack Harris and Tedd Webb. Over the years, AM Tampa Bay has also had three female co-hosts; Sharon Taylor, who was let go after ten years, Allyson Turner, who left less than a year after she was hired, and Corey Dylan, who was promoted to her own show at sister station, WMTX, after four years on WFLA. The station is also the home and flagship for nationally syndicated afternoon host Todd Schnitt (\"The Schnitt Show\"). The station's weekday lineup includes nationally syndicated programs hosted by Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Mark Levin, as well as Coast to Coast AM. Saturday programming includes \"Reel Animals\", an outdoors sports show hosted by Mike Anderson; a home improvement show hosted by David Bell with local experts; the nationally syndicated \"Cigar Dave Show\", which originates from WFLA's studios; and Tony \"Fatso\" Siciliano's \"On The Grill\", a cooking show that also originates from WFLA studios and can be heard on XM Satellite Radio. The Sunday lineup features \"Ask An Attorney\" with Joe Pippen, followed by \"The Florida Gardening Show\", hosted by Mark Govan, and the \"Duncan Duo Real Estate Show\" hosted by Andrew Duncan.\n\nNational news is provided by Fox News Radio and NBC News Radio. At one time, WFLA had live, local newscasts around the clock; in recent years, local newscasts have been limited to 5 a.m.-7 p.m. ET weekdays, and 6 a.m.-1 p.m. ET weekends. As of April 2012, the weekday on-air news staff included anchors Martin Giles (morning drive), Steve Hall (middays), Bill Cole (afternoon drive), and Dennis Pavluk (early evenings), with Hal Lamb as the weekend anchor. Sharon Parker, Gordon Byrd, and Ryan Lang report for the station. Dozens of newscasters have been behind the microphone over the years; most prominent are Giles, Hall and Parker, each having been with the station for more than 20 years, as was former news director Don Richards (d. 2008). Another prominent long-time personality is traffic reporter Gary McHenry, who has been a part of the station since the 1970s and provides updates during morning and afternoon drive.\n\nThe station is the home of University of South Florida Bulls football games. Jim Louk is the play-by-play announcer, and Mark Robinson serves as color analyst. Jim Lighthall and Justin Pawlowski serve as pregame, halftime and postgame hosts. It also carries other sports programming on a case-by-case basis when there are scheduling conflicts with sports events on its sister stations, WDAE (620 AM) and WHNZ (1250 AM), which hold the rights to Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tampa Bay Lightning, Tampa Bay Rays, Tampa Bay Storm and University of Florida broadcasts.\n\nWFLA provides news coverage for other Clear Channel stations in the Tampa Bay market, and its anchors and reporters often are heard elsewhere in the state, providing reports and sometimes complete newscasts for those markets. WFLA also serves as a hub for the Florida News Network. Clear Channel's corporate director of news/talk programming, Senior Vice President Gabe Hobbs, was based at WFLA's studios until January 2009, when he and nearly 2,000 other Clear Channel employees nationwide were laid off in a cost-cutting measure.\n\nSince December 2008, WFLA has been simulcast on the FM radio band, via the HD-2 (digital radio) subchannel of sister station WXTB (97.9 FM). From May 2012 to February 2013, WFLA had been simulcast on a low-powered translator in West Tampa, W237DI 105.9 MHz, which covers most of the city of Tampa. This repeater was leased to Clear Channel by the Radio Training Network, the parent company of The Joy FM. In February 2013, Clear Channel changed the programming on that translator to WMTX 100.7 to broadcast its HD-2 classic rock subchannel, \"Thunder Across The Bay\".\nThe station currently simulcasts over translator on 96.7 FM W244BE, Brandon. The translator is located in Holiday. On July 24, 2017 WFLA began simulcasting on translator W275AZ 102.9 FM Wesley Chapel South.\n\nIn addition to its AM/FM/HD Radio broadcasts, WFLA also provides a shortwave radio broadcast in narrowband FM for listeners on 25,870 kHz, in the 11 meter band (just below CB Radio). While this is intended primarily as a studio link to their traffic helicopter, the station does respond to QSL correspondence from listeners, and despite its very low power, has been heard in Mexico, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom on shortwave\n\n"}
