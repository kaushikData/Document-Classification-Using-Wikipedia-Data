{"id": "13370296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13370296", "title": "Account stacking", "text": "Account stacking\n\nAccount stacking is a broadcast industry term, which refers to the deployment of subscription Direct To Home (DTH) satellite receiving equipment at multiple geographical locations under a single customer account. It is often referred to as 2nd address service, subscription sharing or account splitting.\nAccount stacking is sometimes confused with satellite TV hacking and piracy but in fact, account stacking utilizes receiving apparatus which is legal in every material respect.\nA contentious issue exists since the receiving equipment is easily relocated and most DTH satellite providers prefer to charge a subscription fee on a per dwelling basis, much like cable-TV, and not on a per-receiver or per-customer basis.\nCRTC - Broadcasting Distribution Regulations\nIn Canada, DTH satellite providers are licensed by the CRTC as Broadcast Distribution Undertakings, or BDU's for short. The regulations under which they are authorized to provide service are found in the CRTC's Broadcasting Distribution Regulations.\n1. Under the regulations a \"customer\" means a person who is liable for payment for programming services that are distributed by a licensee and that are received directly or indirectly by one or more subscribers. \n2. A \"subscriber\" is a household of one or more persons, whether occupying a single-unit dwelling or a unit in a multiple-unit dwelling, to which service is provided directly or indirectly by a licensee.\n3. A significant distinction exists between cable TV providers and DTH providers. The 'utility distribution model' used for cable TV does not readily apply to DTH undertakings. Cable TV is provided on a 'per dwelling' basis since it a closed-circuit wire-line service whereas DTH satellite is provided on a 'per customer' basis since the radio waves used for distribution cover a continent-wide area.\n\n4. The CRTC broadcast distribution regulations seem to favour the 'per customer' model and sanction \"account stacking\".\n\n5. The CRTC has a policy in place to accommodate the marketing and billing practice of “account stacking” under its Broadcast Distribution Regulations. This is discussed in Broadcast Public Notices 2006-133 and 2006-134, which provides that ‘discretionary service' channel providers are to be paid a wholesale affiliation fee on a ‘per dwelling’ basis. Basic service channel providers do not receive affiliation fees and so are not affected by this \"Account Stacking\" policy.\nRadiocommunication Act (Canada)\n\n9. (1) No person shall (c) decode an encrypted subscription programming signal or encrypted network feed otherwise than under and in accordance with an authorization from the lawful distributor of the signal or feed.\n\n10. (1) Every person who (b) without lawful excuse, manufactures, imports, distributes, leases, offers for sale, sells, installs, modifies, operates or possesses any equipment or device, or any component thereof, under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the equipment, device or component has been used, or is or was intended to be used, for the purpose of contravening section 9.\n\nComment:\n\nSection 10(1)(b) of the Radiocommunication Act is not there to convict persons who have obtained the statutory authorization to decode an encrypted subscription-programming signal pursuant to Section 9(1)(c).\n\nStatutory authorization exists when the lawful distributor makes its signal available on payment of a subscription fee or other charge.\n\n1.

This coastal area was dominated by the indigenous Fante people. It was established by the African Company Act 1750, and in 1752 replaced the Royal African Company. The latter had been established in 1660.\n\nThe assets of the Royal African Company were transferred to the new company and consisted primarily of nine trading posts or factories: Fort William, Fort James, Fort Sekondi, Fort Winneba, Fort Apollonia, Fort Tantumquery, Fort Metal Cross, Fort Komenda, and Cape Coast Castle, the last of which was the administrative centre.\n\nThe Company was managed by the African Committee, which was composed of nine committee members, three each from London, Liverpool and Bristol. These were elected from the general body of traders from these cities, who paid 40 shillings to be admitted to the company. The company was funded by an annual grant approved by parliament, which covered the costs of the London office and the forts. The Committee had to report to the Exchequer, the Admiralty and, from 1782, the Secretary at War. John Shoolbred FRSE was secretary to the committee for several years.\n\nIn 1807, the Imperial government prohibited the African slave trade after 1807, although the Company continued to operate for some years afterwards. In keeping with the ethos of liberal reform, administrative authority over the African Company's territory was transferred to Governor Charles MacCarthy of Sierra Leone, Sierra Leone having been founded as a refuge colony for freed slaves. (Governor McCarthy was subsequently killed in the First Anglo-Asante War.) In 1817, the Company signed a treaty of friendship recognising the Asante claims to sovereignty over large areas of the coast, including areas claimed by the Fante. However, after it became public knowledge that Company had failed to suppress the African slave trade within its privately held territory, the British government abolished the Company once and for all in 1821. Slavery as an institution, however, continued to exist throughout the British Empire until 1834.\n\n"}

The Amungme are very tied to their ancestral land and consider the surrounding mountains to be sacred.\n\nThis has led to friction with the Indonesian government, which is eager to exploit the vast mineral deposits contained there. Major changes in the Amungme of the highlands and Kamoro of the lowlands lifestyle have been brought about by the Grasberg mine, situated in the heart of Amungme territory and owned by Freeport-McMoRan, the region's largest single employer. Extensive gold and copper mining have altered the landscape, and the presence of the mine and its infrastructure has attracted numerous other economic migrants from western Indonesia as well as other Papuans, some of whom have tried to settle on traditional Amungme lands. This has caused land dispute regarding customary land rights between the Amungme people against Freeport Indonesia mining company in Timika. In the last 35 years, the Amungme have seen their sacred mountain destroyed by the mine, and watched as their relatives are killed by Indonesian soldiers \"defending\" it, while the Kamoro have more than 200,000 tons of waste pumped into their rivers each day. All these factors have created complex social and political stresses, and led to somewhat frequent protests and/or social conflicts, some of which have been violently suppressed by the Indonesian police or military.\n"}

{"id": "27327668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27327668", "title": "Franco-British Union", "text": "Franco-British Union\n\nA Franco-British Union is a concept for a union between the two independent sovereign states of the United Kingdom and France. Such a union was proposed during certain crises of the 20th century; it has some historical precedents.\n\nTies between France and the Kingdom of England have been intimate since the Norman Conquest, in which the Duke of Normandy, an important French fief, became King of England, while also owing feudal ties to the French crown.\n\nThe relationship was never stable, and it only endured as long as the French crown was weak. From 1066 to 1214, the King of England held extensive fiefs in northern France, adding to Normandy the counties of Maine, Anjou, and Touraine, and the Duchy of Brittany. After 1154, the King of England was also Duke of Aquitaine (or Guienne), together with Poitou, Gascony, and other southern French fiefs dependent upon Aquitaine. Together with the northern territories, this meant that the King of England controlled more than half of France – the so-called Angevin Empire – though still nominally as the King of France's vassal. The centre of gravity of this composite realm was generally south of the English channel; four of the first seven kings after the Norman Conquest were French-born, and all were native speakers of French. For centuries thereafter the royalty and nobility of England were educated in French as well as English. In certain respects, England became an outlying province of France; English law took the strong impress of local French law, and the English language itself was saturated with French words.\n\nThis anomalous situation came to an end with the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, when King Philip of France deposed King John of England from his northern French fiefs; in the chaos that followed, the heir to the throne of France, later Louis VIII, was offered the throne of England by rebellious English barons from 1216 to 1217 and travelled there to take it. He was proclaimed King of England in St. Paul's Cathedral, where many nobles, including King Alexander II of Scotland, paid him homage. He captured Winchester and soon controlled over half the kingdom, but after the death of King John his support dwindled and he was forced to make peace, renouncing his claim to the throne. England was ultimately able to retain a reduced Guienne as a French fief, which was retained and enlarged when war between the two kingdoms resumed in 1337.\n\nFrom 1340 to 1360, and from 1369 on, the King of England assumed the title of \"King of France\"; but although England was generally successful in its war with France, no attempt was made to make the title a reality during that period of time.\n\nThe situation changed with Henry V's invasion of France in 1415. By 1420, England controlled northern France (including the capital) for the first time in 200 years. The King of France was forced to disinherit his own son, the Dauphin Charles, in favour of Henry V. As Henry predeceased the French king by a few months, his son Henry VI was proclaimed king of England and of France from 1422 by the English and their allies but the Dauphin retained control over parts of central and southern France and claimed the crown for himself. From 1429 the Dauphin's party, including Joan of Arc, counterattacked and succeeded in crowning him as king.\n\nFighting between England and France continued for more than twenty years after, but by 1453 the English were expelled from all of France except Calais, which was lost in 1558. England also briefly held the town of Dunkirk in 1658–1662. The Kings of England and their successor Kings of Great Britain, purely as a habitual expression and with no associated political claim, continued to use the title \"King of France\" until 1801; the heads of the House of Stuart, out of power since 1688, used the title until their extinction in 1807.\n\nNorman or French culture first gained a foothold in Scotland during the Davidian Revolution, when King David I introduced Continental-style reforms throughout all aspects of Scottish life: social, religious, economic and administrative. He also invited immigrant French and Anglo-French peoples to Scotland. This effectively created a Franco-Scottish aristocracy, with ties to the French aristocracy as well as many to the Franco-English aristocracy. From the Wars of Scottish Independence, as common enemies of England and its ruling House of Plantagenet, Scotland and France started to enjoy a close diplomatic relationship, the Auld Alliance, from 1295 to 1560. From the Late Middle Ages and into the Early Modern Period Scotland and its burghs also benefited from close economic and trading links with France in addition to its links to the Low Countries, Scandinavia and the Baltic.\n\nThe prospect of dynastic union came in the 15th and 16th centuries, when Princess Margaret, eldest daughter of James I of Scotland, married the future Louis XI of France; and later the King of Scotland, James V, married two French brides in succession. His infant daughter, Mary I, succeeded him on his death in 1542. For many years thereafter the country was ruled under a regency led by her French mother, Mary of Guise, who succeeded in marrying her daughter to the child Dauphin Francis, who thus took the title of \"King of Scots\"; when he succeeded as King of France in 1559, France and Scotland were tentatively united in a kind of personal union. Had Francis survived to have a son with Mary, their child would have become king of both France and Scotland (and, perhaps, later of England as well); but in fact, Francis died in 1560, and Mary returned to a Scotland heaving with political revolt and religious revolution, which made a continuation of the alliance impossible.\n\nCordial economic and cultural relations did continue however, although throughout the 17th century, the Scottish establishment became increasingly Presbyterian, often belligerent to Roman Catholicism, a facet which was somewhat at odds with Louis XIV's aggressively Catholic foreign and domestic policy. The relationship was further weakened by the Union of the Crowns in 1603, which meant from then on that although still independent, executive power in the Scottish government, the Crown, was shared with the Kingdom of England and Scottish foreign policy came into line more with that of England than with France.\n\nIn April 1904 the United Kingdom and the Third French Republic signed a series of agreements, known as the \"Entente Cordiale\", which marked the end of centuries of intermittent conflict between the two powers, and the start of a period of peaceful co-existence. Although French historian Fernand Braudel (1902–1985) described England and France as a single unit, nationalist political leaders from both sides were uncomfortable with the idea of such a merging.\n\nIn December 1939, Jean Monnet of the French Economic Mission in London became the head of the Anglo-French Coordinating Committee, which coordinated joint planning of the two countries' wartime economies. The Frenchman hoped for a postwar United States of Europe and saw an Anglo-French political union as a step toward his goal. He discussed the idea with Neville Chamberlain, Winston Churchill's assistant Desmond Morton, and other British officials.\n\nIn June 1940, French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud's government faced imminent defeat in the Battle of France. In March, they and the British had agreed that neither country would seek a separate peace with Nazi Germany. The French cabinet on 15 June voted to ask Germany for the terms of an armistice. Reynaud, who wished to continue the war from North Africa, was forced to submit the proposal to Churchill's War Cabinet. He claimed that he would have to resign if the British were to reject the proposal.\n\nThe British opposed a French surrender, and in particular the possible loss of the French Navy to the Germans, and so sought to keep Reynaud in office. On 14 June British diplomat Robert Vansittart and Morton wrote with Monnet and his deputy René Pleven a draft \"Franco-British Union\" proposal. They hoped that such a union would help Reynaud persuade his cabinet to continue the war from North Africa, but Churchill was sceptical when on 15 June the British War Cabinet discussed the proposal and a similar one from Secretary of State for India Leo Amery. On the morning of 16 June, the War Cabinet agreed to the French armistice request on the condition that the French fleet sail to British harbors. This disappointed Reynaud, who had hoped to use a British rejection to persuade his cabinet to continue to fight.\n\nReynaud supporter Charles de Gaulle had arrived in London earlier that day, however, and Monnet told him about the proposed union. De Gaulle convinced Churchill that \"some dramatic move was essential to give Reynaud the support which he needed to keep his Government in the war\". The Frenchman then called Reynaud and told him that the British prime minister proposed a union between their countries, an idea which Reynaud immediately supported. De Gaulle, Monnet, Vansittart, and Pleven quickly agreed to a document proclaiming a joint citizenship, foreign trade, currency, war cabinet, and military command. Churchill withdrew the armistice approval, and at 3 p.m. the War Cabinet met again to consider the union document. Despite the radical nature of the proposal, Churchill and the ministers recognized the need for a dramatic act to encourage the French and reinforce Reynaud's support within his cabinet before it met again at 5pm.\n\nThe final \"Declaration of union\" approved by the British War Cabinet stated that\nChurchill and De Gaulle called Reynaud to tell him about the document, and they arranged for a joint meeting of the two governments in Concarneau the next day. The declaration immediately succeeded in its goal of encouraging Reynaud, who saw the union as the only alternative to surrender and who could now cite the British rejection of the armistice.\n\nOther French leaders were less enthusiastic, however. At the 5 p.m. cabinet meeting, many called it a British \"last minute plan\" to steal its colonies, and said that \"be[ing] a Nazi province\" was preferable to becoming a British dominion. Philippe Pétain, a leader of the pro-armistice group, called union \"fusion with a corpse\". While President Albert Lebrun and some others were supportive, the cabinet's opposition stunned Reynaud. He resigned that evening without taking a formal vote on the union or an armistice, and later called the failure of the union the \"greatest disappointment of my political career\".\n\nReynaud had erred, however, by conflating opposition to the union—which a majority of the cabinet almost certainly opposed—with support for an armistice, which it almost certainly did not. If the proposal had been made a few days earlier, instead of the 16th when the French only had hours to decide between armistice and North Africa, Reynaud's cabinet might have considered it more carefully.\n\nPétain formed a new government that evening, which immediately decided to ask Germany for armistice terms. The British cancelled their plans to travel to Concarneau.\n\nIn September 1956, due to a common foe during the Suez Crisis, an Anglo-French Task Force was created. French Prime Minister Guy Mollet proposed a union between the United Kingdom and the French Union with Elizabeth II as head of state and a common citizenship. As an alternative, Mollet proposed that France join the Commonwealth. British Prime Minister Anthony Eden rejected both proposals and France went on to join the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community and strengthened the Franco-German cooperation.\n\nWhen the Mollet proposal was first made public in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2007 through an article by Mike Thomson published on the BBC News website, it received rather satirical treatment in the media of both countries, including the name, coined by the BBC, of Frangleterre (merging \"France\" with \"Angleterre\", which is the French word for \"England\"). The UK broadcaster stated that Mollet's proposal originated from newly declassified material, arguing no such archive documents exist in France.\n\nOn 16 January 2007, during a LCP television programme, French journalist Christine Clerc asked former French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua (Gaullist) about Mollet's 1956 proposal. Pasqua answered, \"if his demand had been made official, Mollet would have been brought to trial for high treason\".\n\nThe Lord Darcy alternate history stories take place in a world where Richard I of England lived much longer than in the history we know and managed to unite England and France under his rule; by the 20th Century, \" Anglo-French\" is a common language spoken by the inhabitants on both sides of the Channel, and there is no doubt of their all being a single people.\n\n\n"}

The name originated from the Roman town of Melite (Μελίτη, \"Melite\" in Ancient Greek), which was the ancient capital of Malta which eventually developed into Mdina or Città Notabile.\n\nThe symbolic depiction of a country as a woman called by the Latin name of that country was common in the 19th Century (such as Britannia, Germania, Hibernia and Helvetia).\n\nMelita has been portrayed a number of times on Maltese postage or revenue stamps. She appeared on 4 February 1899 on a 2/6 stamp designed by an unknown Malta Post Office official. She is shown wearing a helmet and a garment, while holding a sword in one hand and a shield in the other. The flags of Malta and of the Order of Saint John appeared behind her. This stamp was in use for many years until the 1920s. Special printings of this stamp were overprinted for revenue use from 1902 to 1908.\n\nA different version of Melita was used for the 1922 definitive set designed by Edward Caruana Dingli. The design shows Melita wearing a garment over a breastplate showing the Maltese Cross, as well as a helmet and sandals. She is holding a rudder representing the Maltese in control of Malta's destiny. This was done because Malta had just achieved self-government a year before, and the stamps were commemorating this event. This design was featured as a stamp-on-stamp in 2011, and it is considered as one of Malta's most beautiful stamps.\n\nThe shilling values in this set used a different design by Gianni Vella. The Vella design showed two symbolic figures, a man representing Britain, holding a shield with the Union Jack and with his left hand resting on Melita, who is holding an olive branch. The design symbolized the protection and good relations between the two countries.\n\nEdward Caruana Dingli's Melita design was reused for the fifth series Maltese banknotes issued by the Central Bank of Malta. This series was issued between 1989 and 2000 and remained in use until 2008 when Malta adopted the Euro.

The Comoros possesses of road, of which are paved. It has three seaports: Fomboni, Moroni and Moutsamoudou, but does not have a merchant marine, and no longer has any railway network. It has four airports, all with paved runways, one with runways over long, with the others having runways shorter than .\n\nThe isolation of the Comoros had made air traffic a major means of transportation. One of President Abdallah's accomplishments was to make the Comoros more accessible by air. During his administration, he negotiated agreements to initiate or enhance commercial air links with Tanzania and Madagascar. The Djohar regime reached an agreement in 1990 to link Moroni and Brussels by air. By the early 1990s, commercial flights connected the Comoros with France, Mauritius, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Madagascar. The national airline was Air Comores. Daily flights linked the three main islands, and air service was also available to Mahoré; each island had airstrips. In 1986 the republic received a grant from the French government's CCCE to renovate and expand Hahaya airport, near Moroni. Because of the absence of scheduled sea transport between the islands, nearly all interisland passenger traffic is by air.\n\nMore than 99% of freight is transported by sea. Both Moroni on Njazidja and Mutsamudu on Nzwani have artificial harbors. There is also a harbor at Fomboni, on Mwali. Despite extensive internationally financed programs to upgrade the harbors at Moroni and Mutsamudu, by the early 1990s only Mutsamudu was operational as a deepwater facility. Its harbor could accommodate vessels of up to eleven meters' draught. At Moroni, ocean-going vessels typically lie offshore and are loaded or unloaded by smaller craft, a costly and sometimes dangerous procedure. Most freight continues to be sent to Kenya, Reunion, or Madagascar for transshipment to the Comoros. Use of Comoran ports is further restricted by the threat of cyclones from December through March. The privately operated Comoran Navigation Company (\"Société Comorienne de Navigation\") is based in Moroni, and provides services to Madagascar.\n\nRoads serve the coastal areas, rather than the interior, and the mountainous terrain makes surface travel difficult.\n\n\n"}
