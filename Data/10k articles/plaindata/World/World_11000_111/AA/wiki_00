{"id": "54776012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54776012", "title": "Freedom Friday", "text": "Freedom Friday\n\nFreedom Friday one of few political opposition organizations in Eritrea. Also known as the Arbi Harnet Project, this opposition movement seeks to empower Eritreans to publicly challenge the current sitting government. According to former diplomat Fathi Osman, there are approximately 5,000 activists out of 6 million Eritreans, and many choose to act in opposition before fleeing the oppressive country. This movement started under the \"Empty the Street\" Campaign, which was inspired by the Arab Spring movements. However, due to the political culture in Eritrea, youthful citizens were unable to gather to organize mass protests. The official date the movement began was November 11th, 2011 when original members made calls and sent messages around the country to join in protesting for democratic changes. \n\nThis movement is based on the freedom of being able to spread information to one another. The political climate within the country places the power in the hands of the sitting regime and inhibits individual freedoms. In the \"2018 World Press Freedom Index\" by Reporters without borders, Eritrea out ranked only one other country, that being North Korea. The organization goes on to say \"For the past 26 years, Eritrea has been a dictatorship in which there is no room for freely reported news and information\" and \"Like everything else in Eritrea, the media are totally subject to the whim of President Issayas Afeworki, a predator of press freedom who is responsible for 'crimes against humanity,' according to a June 2016 UN report\". President Issayas has full control over what information is published to the citizens of Eritrea, and the only way to receive information is to have it smuggled in, broadcast from a different country, or secretly receive information from the internet. In a Vice News Documentary published in 2017 the news organization said \"Often referred to as Africa's North Korea, the Eritrean government controls the flow of information with vigilance, restricting any dissenting voices from reaching the people.\" With 1% of the countries population having internet access and only 6% having mobile phones information is easily censored, especially with Eritrean law forbidding independent media outlets. For a country with a population of 6 million, Eritrea only has one publishing news paper, in which Eritrean refugees say \"that's all you read\".\n\nDue to the strong power that the government holds in this fairly new country, resistance, and spreading the message of resistance is extremely difficult. But unlike the militant resistance that is conducted by Red Sea Afar Democratic Organisation (RSADO), the Freedom Friday movement focuses on information campaigns. The main goals of the organization include \"heighten the level of indignation against the regimes actions. Encourage people to go beyond the individual response of fleeing the country but seek a communal solution to the common problem. Support people in the search for actions that challenge the regime without putting people in danger as they build their confidence in challenging the regime. Link the opposition in diaspora to our people inside the country.\" The movement uses multiple outlets to spread their message ranging from independent radio stations broadcasting from different countries, to simple graffiti on Eritrean bank notes. This movement essentially coordinates underground activists within the country to spread information to the broad population, as well as provide video and information of what is being published by the governments media. Selam Kidane, a co-founder of the movement, frequently posts messages to social media including Facebook and Twitter in hopes to spread hope for individuals stuck within the oppressive country, but also in hopes that they will grow the will to rise up and resist the government in the streets of major cities. Although only 1% of the countries population has access to the internet, social media accounts for Eritrean resistance are numerous, and well supported. With a large separation between individuals and internet within the country, other methods of streaming hopeful messages has to take place. As done by Radio Erena, and Radio Assenna, they look to provide an independent information source to the population via satellite and radio. These along with others broadcast messages to Eritreans informing them of different events occuring in the world, as well as encouraging individuals to not flee the country and instead rebel. Yet both of these information sources also provide websites and publish articles in which they discuss and update information the current situations that are occuring within the country itself, for the international community to see. According to another independent publisher focused on Eritrea, individuals within the country also conduct mass robo-calls to landlines, as well as post posters along with graffiti markings to encourage and positively support resistance to oppression. \nAlthough Eritrea has been mentioned by many international leaders and organizations, little has been done to intervene. On June 8th, 2015, the United Nations published a special inquiry detailing gross human rights violations within the country. At the Clinton Global Initiative in 2012, then President Barak Obama mentioned that he renewed sanctions against the country as a result of continual human rights abuse. The United Kingdom Parliament held a debate on what action to take against the human rights abuse occurring within Eritrea. As well as former President Hollande of France spoke with great frustration on the severity of what is occuring. However, despite attention by recognizable international leaders, little has been done outside of publishing dissenting rhetoric. Little tangible support has been provided by the international community and has lead to an increase in difficulty for the movement. \n"}

These gnomes had their base in the village of Hoogeloon. From Hoogeloon the gnomes often made journeys in the neighboring lands. According to tradition the Gnome King Kyrië lived on the Kerkakkers in the Kabouterberg (Gnome Mountain) also known as Duivelsberg (Devil's Mountain), a tumulus located in the Koebosch forest, slightly northeast of Hoogeloon.\n\nThe gnomes of the Campine were helpful creatures who helped mostly the farmers and the households in the Campine and also in the neighboring lands of the Peel and the Meierij. They came by night and did not want to be seen by people. If people did see them, they were punished by the gnomes. One story tells of an inquisitive farmer who spied on the gnomes and later became blind in one eye as a punishment.\n\nOne day, Gnome King Kyrië was shot by a hunter in the heathlands of Riethoven (most sources name the winter of 1952/1953, some place his death in the winter of 1951/1952). He had just enough strength to reach the Duivelsberg (Devil's Mountain) where the gnomes lived. The hunter looked for what he had shot down, when he heard the shocked gnomes say: \"Kyrië is dead\". The sad message that their king had died spread quickly among all gnome settlements in the region. Gnome King Kyrië was buried somewhere in Hoogeloon. After the death of their king, all the gnomes left the area to an unknown destination. Nobody has ever since heard or seen these Campine gnomes.\n\nIn Hoogeloon, a village pump with a statue of Gnome King Kyrië on it was erected on the Valensplein in 1985. It is designed by Gubbels. On 9 April 2001 the pump and statue were moved to another place on the same square after a reconstruction of the Valensplein. At the same time a special 'Koning Kyrië Kruidenbitter', a bitter, was introduced.\n"}

{"id": "2898787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2898787", "title": "International regime", "text": "International regime\n\nAn international regime is an international process and collection of rules. Sometimes, when formally organized, it can transform into an intergovernmental organization. They are, however, not actors or non-governmental organizations. Organizations only regulate and promote regimes.\n\nStephen D. Krasner defined International Regimes as “Implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules and decision-making procedures around which actors’ expectations converge in a given area of international relations”in the journal \"International Organization\" in 1982. Regimes \"are more specialized arrangements that pertain to well-defined activities, resources, or geographical areas and often involve only some subset of the members of international society\", according to Oran R. Young, in his 1989 book \"International Cooperation : Building Regimes for Natural Resources and the Environment\".\n\nTypes of regimes include International Conventions such as the Basel Convention, the Mediterranean Action Plan and well-known regimes like the Bretton Woods System of monetary management. International Regimes might also include international organizations in a broader sense.\n\nInternational regimes often form in response to a need to coordinate behavior among countries around an issue. In the absence of an overarching regime, for instance, telecommunications between countries would have to be governed by numerous bilateral agreements, which would become impossibly complex to administer worldwide. A regime such as ITU serves simultaneously as a forum, a multilateral treaty, and a governing body to standardize telecommunications across countries efficiently. The International Monetary Fund, Biological Weapons Convention, and Kyoto Protocol are other examples of international regimes. The number of international regimes has increased dramatically since the Second World War, and today regimes cover almost all aspects of international relations that might require coordination among countries, from security issues (such as weapons non-proliferation or collective defense), to trade, finance, and investment, information and communication, human rights, the environment, and management of outer space—to name a few.\n\nSome scholars emphasize the importance of a hegemon in creating a regime and giving it momentum. This is called the hegemonic stability theory. The United States, for example, has been instrumental in creating the Bretton Woods system, with organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The rationale is that a hegemon, being the dominant actor in international politics and economics, often stands to gain the most from the creation of global standards. For instance, while other countries might benefit from it, U.S. companies like Microsoft, Universal Studios, and Pfizer would be among the greatest beneficiaries of a strict global intellectual property regime. As the hegemons use their power to create regimes, their withdrawal similarly can also threaten the effectiveness of regimes.\n\nRegimes serve crucial functional needs in international relations. Powerful regimes are considered by some scholars as independent actors in international politics. Although ultimately states create and sustain regimes, once institutionalized, regimes can exert influence in world politics that is practically independent of state sovereignty. The International Atomic Energy Agency, for instance, has certain rights, given to it by states themselves, to monitor nuclear energy activity in countries. Insofar as they are organized by means of treaties among countries, regimes provide an important source of formal international law. Regimes themselves can also be subjects of international law. Insofar as they shape the behavior of states, the most influential regimes can also be a source of customary international law. In this light, some liberal scholars see in regimes the early seeds of peaceful world governance, in the vein of philosopher Immanuel Kant's idea of perpetual peace through a federation of world's states. \n\nCritics of regimes deplore their influence as a source of additional conflict or inefficiency in world politics. The security regime organized around the United Nations Security Council is sometimes cited as a case in point. Some other scholars are also alarmed that regimes represent a dilution of democratic control. Although they govern and influence important aspects of life, they operate steps removed from domestic democratic politics, organized around a legislature. In effect, some critics argue, most regimes come to represent the technocratic views of international civil servants, with agreements made behind closed doors, rather than being subject to openness and democratic popular representation. Some regimes, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) have tried to address this \"democratic deficit\" by establishing civilian affairs departments, which are supposed to act as a liaison to the popular will. Most regimes are still insulated from the direct democratic politics that happen within states. Some, however, consider such insulation necessary, since much of international coordination require specialized expertise provided best by technocrats.\n\n"}

It won the 2018 Man Booker Prize for Fiction, the first time a Northern Irish writer has been awarded the prize.\n\nSet during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, the story follows an 18-year-old girl who is forced into a relationship by an older married man known as the \"milkman\". The novel received positive reviews from \"The Guardian\", \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"The Irish Times\".\n\nThe novel won the 2018 Man Booker Prize. Her novel became the 50th novel to win the Man Booker prize.\n\nKwame Anthony Appiah, Chair of judges commented:\n\n‘The language of Anna Burns’ Milkman is simply marvellous; beginning with the distinctive and consistently realised voice of the funny, resilient, astute, plain-spoken, first-person protagonist. From the opening page her words pull us into the daily violence of her world — threats of murder, people killed by state hit squads — while responding to the everyday realities of her life as a young woman, negotiating a way between the demands of family, friends and lovers in an unsettled time. The novel delineates brilliantly the power of gossip and social pressure in a tight-knit community, and shows how both rumour and political loyalties can be put in the service of a relentless campaign of individual sexual harassment. Burns draws on the experience of Northern Ireland during the Troubles to portray a world that allows individuals to abuse the power granted by a community to those who resist the state on their behalf. Yet this is never a novel about just one place or time. The local is in service to an exploration of the universal experience of societies in crisis.’\n"}

Radar can track targets near the Earth, but spacecraft in deep space must have a working transponder on board to echo a radio signal back. Orientation information can be obtained using star trackers.\n\nGlobal navigation satellite systems (GNSS) allow specialized radio receivers to determine their 3-D space position, as well as time, with an accuracy of 2–20 metres or tens of nanoseconds.

They are generally less accurate than GNSS because their signals are not entirely restricted to line-of-sight propagation, and they have only regional coverage.
