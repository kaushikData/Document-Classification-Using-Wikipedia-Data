The division's headquarters houses laboratories for science, electronics and electron microscopy, mechanical and instrument workshops, a krill research aquarium, a herbarium, equipment stores, communications and other operational and support facilities. The Chief Scientist since 2016 has been Dr Gwen Fenton.\n\nThe AAD maintains three permanently manned stations on the Antarctic continent, and one on Macquarie Island in the subantarctic:\n\n\nRemote field bases operate during the summer research season supporting coastal, inland and traverse operations.\n\nThe AAD uses an air transport system, both for transport to and from Antarctica, and for transport within the continent. Aircraft for this system are provided and operated under contract by private sector operators. Services to and from Antarctica are provided, between November and February each year, by an Airbus A319-115LR operated by Skytraders. This aircraft operates to and from the Wilkins ice runway, situated some from Casey Station.\n\nServices within Antarctica are provided by a mixture of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Fixed-wing services are provided by a pair of CASA 212–400 aircraft, equipped with skis, that are also operated by Skytraders. These aircraft operate from Wilkins runway and from smaller snow runways at each of the three permanent stations, as well as any field locations which provide the necessary flat area of snow or ice. Helicopter services are provided by three Eurocopter AS 350 BA Squirrel helicopters, operated by Helicopter Resources.\n\nThe Antarctic Flight RAAF operated from 1948 to 1963. Since its withdrawal, aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force operated infrequently in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands in the 1970s and 1980s, and more recently in late 2015.\n\nThe AAD uses the icebreaker \"RSV Aurora Australis\", a multi-purpose marine research and resupply ship chartered from P&O Polar. The \"Aurora Australis\" was launched in 1989 and built by Carrington Slipways in Newcastle, New South Wales. In late October 2015 the Australian government announced a plan to acquire a new ice-breaker to replace \"Aurora Australis\" by 2019.\n\nThe AAD is responsible, on behalf of the Australian Government, for administering the two Australian federal territories that lie in Antarctic or sub-Antarctic latitudes:\n\n\nAlthough the AAD maintains a base on Macquarie Island, that island is not a federal territory but is rather part of the Australian state of Tasmania.\n\n"}
{"id": "44253151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44253151", "title": "Base erosion and profit shifting", "text": "Base erosion and profit shifting\n\nBase erosion and profit shifting or BEPS refers to corporate tax planning strategies used by multinationals to \"shift\" profits from higher–tax jurisdictions to lower–tax jurisdictions, thus \"eroding\" the \"tax–base\" of the higher–tax jurisdictions. The OECD defines BEPS strategies as also: \"exploiting gaps and mismatches in tax rules\"; however, academics proved corporate tax havens (e.g. Ireland, the Caribbean, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, and Hong Kong), who are the largest global BEPS hubs, use OECD–whitelisted tax structures and OECD–compliant BEPS tools. Corporate tax havens offer BEPS tools to \"shift\" profits to the haven, and additional BEPS tools to avoid paying taxes within the haven (e.g. Ireland's \"Green Jersey\"). BEPS tools are mostly associated with U.S. technology and life science multinationals. Tax academics showed use of BEPS tools by U.S. multinationals, via tax havens, maximised long–term U.S. exchequer receipts and/or shareholder returns, at the expense of other jurisdictions.\n\nA January 2017 OECD report estimates that BEPS tools are responsible for tax losses of circa $100–240 billion per annum. A June 2018 report by tax academic Gabriel Zucman (et alia), estimated that the figure is closer to $200 billion per annum. The Tax Justice Network estimated that profits of $660 billion were \"shifted\" in 2015 (due to Apple's Q1 2015 leprechaun economics restructuring, the largest individual BEPS transaction in history). The effect of BEPS tools is most felt in developing economies, who are denied the tax revenues needed to build infrastructure.\n\nMost BEPS activity is associated with industries with intellectual property (\"IP\"), namely Technology (e.g. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oracle), and Life Sciences (e.g. Allergan, Medtronic, Pfizer and Merck & Co) (see here). IP is described as the \"raw materials of tax avoidance\", and IP–based BEPS tools are responsible for the largest global BEPS income flows. Corporate tax havens have some of the most advanced IP tax leglislation in their statutate books.\n\nMost BEPS activity is also most associated with U.S. multinationals, and is attributed to the historical U.S. \"worldwide\" corporate taxation system. Pre the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"TCJA\"), the U.S. was one of only eight jurisdictions to operate a \"worldwide\" tax system. Most global jurisdictions operate a \"territorial\" corporate tax system with lower tax rates for foreign sourced income, thus avoiding the need to \"shift\" profits (i.e. IP can be charged directly from the home country at preferential rates and/or terms; the TCJA now enables this in the U.S. with the FDII–regime).\n\nResearch in June 2018, identified Ireland as the world's largest BEPS hub. Ireland is larger than the \"aggregate\" Caribbean tax haven BEPS system. The largest global BEPS hubs, from the Zucman–Tørsløv–Wier table below, are synonymous with the top 10 global tax havens:\n\n(†) Mostly consists of The Cayman Islands and The British Virgin Islands\n\nResearch in September 2018, by the National Bureau of Economic Research, using repatriation tax data from the TCJA, said that: \"In recent years, about half of the foreign profits of U.S. multinationals have been booked in tax haven affiliates, most prominently in Ireland (18%), Switzerland, and Bermuda plus Caribbean tax havens (8%–9% each). One of the authors of this research was also quoted as saying: “Ireland solidifies its position as the #1 tax haven.”; and also that: “U.S. firms book more profits in Ireland than in China, Japan, Germany, France & Mexico combined. Irish tax rate: 5.7%.”\n\nResearch identifies three main BEPS techniques used for \"shifting\" profits to a corporate tax haven via OECD–compliant BEPS tools:\n\nBEPS tools could not function if the corporate tax haven did not have a network of bilateral tax treaties that accept the haven’s BEPS tools, which \"shift\" the profits to the haven. Modern corporate tax havens, who are the main global BEPS hubs, have extensive networks of bilateral tax treaties. The U.K. is the leader with over 122, followed by the Netherlands with over 100. The \"blacklisting\" of a corporate tax haven is a serious event, which is why major BEPS hubs are OECD-compliant. Ireland was the first major corporate tax haven to be \"blacklisted\" by a G20 economy; Brazil, in September 2016.\n\nAn important academic study in July 2017 published in \"Nature\", \"Conduit and Sink OFCs\", showed that the pressure to maintain OECD–compliance had split corporate–focused tax havens into two different classifications: Sink OFCs, which act as the \"terminus\" for BEPS flows, and Conduit OFCs, which act as the \"conduit\" for flows from higher–tax locations to the Sink OFCs. It was noted that the 5 major Conduit OFCs, namely, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Switzerland, all have a top–ten ranking in the 2018 \"Global Innovation Property Centre (GIPC) IP Index\".\n\nOnce profits are \"shifted\" to the corporate tax haven (or Conduit OFC), additional tools are used to avoid paying \"headline\" tax rates in the haven. Some of these tools are OCED–compliant (e.g. patent boxes, Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets (\"CAIA\") or \"Green Jersey\"), others became OECD–proscribed (e.g. Double Irish and Dutch Double–Dipping), while others have not attracted OECD attention (e.g. Single Malt).\n\nBecause of the need for BEPS hubs (or Conduit OFCs) to have extensive bilateral tax treaties (e.g. so that their BEPS tools will be accepted by the higher–tax locations), they go to great lengths to obscure the fact that \"effective tax rates\" paid by multinationals in their jurisdiction are close to zero percent, rather than the \"headline\" corporate tax rate of the haven (see Table 1). Higher–tax jurisdictions do not enter into full bilateral tax treaties with obvious tax havens (e.g. the Cayman Islands, a major Sink OFC). This is achieved with financial secrecy laws, and by the avoidance of \"country–by–country reporting\" (\"CbCr\") or the need to file public accounts, by multinationals in the haven's jurisdiction. BEPS hubs (or Conduit OFCs) strongly deny they are corporate tax havens, and that their use of IP is as a tax avoidance tool. They call themselves \"knowledge economies\".\n\nThe complex accounting tools, and the detailed tax legislation, that corporate tax havens require to become OECD–compliant BEPS hubs, requires both advanced international tax–law professional services firms, and a high degree of coordination with the State, who encode their BEPS tools into the State's statutory legislation. Tax investigators call such jurisdictions \"captured states\", and explain that most leading BEPS hubs started as established financial centres, where the necessary skills and State support for tax avoidance tools, already existed.\n\nThe BEPS tools used by tax havens have been known and discussed for decades in Washington. For example, when Ireland was pressured by the EU-OECD to close its double Irish BEPS tool, the largest in history, to new entrants in January 2015, existing users, which include Google and Facebook, were given a 5-year extension to 2020. Even before 2015, Ireland had already publicly replaced the double Irish with two new BEPS tools: the single malt (as used by Microsoft and Allergan), and capital allowances for intangible assets (\"CAIA\"), also called the \"Green Jersey\", (as used by Apple in Q1 2015). None of these new BEPS tools have been as yet proscribed by the OECD. Tax experts show that disputes between higher-tax jurisdictions and tax havens are very rare.\n\nTax experts describe a more complex picture of an implicit acceptance by Washington that U.S. multinationals could use BEPS tools on non–U.S. earnings to offset the very high U.S. 35% corporate tax rate from the historical U.S. \"worldwide\" corporate tax system (see source of contradictions). Other tax experts, including a founder of academic tax haven research, James R. Hines Jr., note that U.S. multinational use of BEPS tools and corporate tax havens had actually increased the long–term tax receipts of the U.S. exchequer, at the expense of other higher–tax jurisdictions, making the U.S a major beneficiary of BEPS tools and corporate-tax havens. \n\nThe 1994 Hines–Rice paper on U.S. multinational use of tax havens was the first to use the term \"profit shifting\". Hines–Rice concluded that: \"low foreign tax rates [from tax havens] ultimately enhance U.S. tax collections\". For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"TCJA\") levied 15.5% on the untaxed offshore cash reserves built up by U.S. multinationals with BEPS tools from 2004–2017. Had these U.S. multinationals not used BEPS tools, and paid their full foreign taxes, their foreign tax credits would have removed most of their residual exposure to any U.S. tax liability, under the U.S. tax code.\n\nThe U.S. was one of the only major developed nations not to sign up to the 2016 to curtail BEPS tools.\n\nThe 2012 G20 Los Cabos summit tasked the OECD to develop a \"BEPS Action Plan\", which 2013 G-20 St. Petersburg summit approved. An OECD BEPS Multilateral Instrument, consisting of \"15 Actions\" designed to be implemented domestically and through bilateral tax treaty provisions, were agreed at the 2015 G20 Antalya summit.\n\nThe OECD BEPS Multilateral Instrument (\"MLI\"), was adopted on 24 November 2016 and has since been signed by over 78 jurisdictions. It came into force in July 2018. Many tax havens opted–out from several of the Actions, including Action 12 (Disclosure of aggressive tax planning), which was considered onerous by corporations who use BEPS tools.\n\nThe acknowledged \"architect\" of the largest ever global corporate BEPS tools (e.g. Google and Facebooks' Double Irish and Apple's Green Jersey), tax partner Feargal O'Rourke from PriceWaterhouseCoopers (\"PwC), predicted in May 2015 that the OECD's MLI would be a success for the leading corporate tax havens, at the expense of the smaller, less developed, traditional tax havens, whose BEPS tools were not sufficiently robust.\n\nIn August 2016, the Tax Justice Network's Alex Cobham described the OECD's MLI as a failure due to the opt–outs and watering–down of individual BEPS Actions. In December 2016, Cobham highlighted that one of the critical anti–BEPS Actions, full public \"country–by–country–reporting\" (\"CbCr\"), had been dropped due to lobbying by the U.S. multinationals. CbCr is the only way to conclusively observe the level of BEPS activitiy and OECD compliance in any country.\n\nIn June 2017, a U.S. Treasury official explained that the reason why U.S. refused to sign up to the OECD's MLI, or any of its Actions, was because: \"the U.S. tax treaty network has a low degree of exposure to base erosion and profit shifting issues\".\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"TCJA\") moved the U.S. from a \"worldwide\" corporate tax system to a hybrid \"territorial\" tax system. The TCJA includes anti–BEPS tool regimes including the GILTI–tax and BEAT–tax regimes. It also contains its own BEPS tools, namely the FDII–tax regime. The TCJA could represent a major change in Washington's tolerance of U.S. multinational use of BEPS tools. Tax experts in early 2018 forecast the demise of the two major U.S. corporate tax havens, Ireland and Singapore, in the expectation that U.S. multinationals would no longer need foreign BEPS tools.\n\nHowever, by mid–2018, U.S. multinationals had not repatriated any BEPS tools, and the evidence is that they have increased exposure to corporate tax havens. In March–May 2018, Google committed to doubling its office space in Ireland, while in June 2018 it was shown that Microsoft is preparing to execute Apple's Irish BEPS tool, the \"Green Jersey\" (see Irish experience post–TCJA). In July 2018, one of Ireland's leading tax experts forecasted a potential boom in U.S. multinationals on–shoring their BEPS tools from the Caribbean to Ireland, and not to the U.S. as was expected after TCJA.\n\nIn May 2018, it was shown that the TCJA contains technical issues that incentivise these actions. For example, by accepting Irish tangible, and intangible, capital allowances in the GILTI calculation, Irish BEPS tools like the \"Green Jersey\" enable U.S. multinationals to achieve \"U.S. effective tax rates\" of 0–3% via the TCJA's foreign \"participation relief\" system. There is debate as to whether these are drafting mistakes to be corrected, or concessions to enable U.S. multinationals to reduce their effective corporate tax rates to circa 10% (the Trump administration's original target).\n\n\n"}

The result of such an arrangement is an elevated probability for an international conflagration, since the case of an actor attacking another power would almost certainly trigger, whether intentionally or not, a multinational conflict potentially involving many more actors than the original two states which had attacked and been attacked, respectively. According to sworn agreements or treaties no member state has the option to refuse to participate in this involvement: once the states have agreed to the alliance, they are bound by obligation to join in the hostilities or conflagration as soon as they have begun in one state (though this obligation is not always honoured).\n\nAn empirical example of the chain ganging dilemma is World War I. When Italy decided to part from the Triple Alliance, both Austria-Hungary and Germany were alone for the most part in Europe (though Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire joined Austria-Hungary and Germany to form the Central Powers), and surrounded by the Allied Powers. The defeat of either of the two would severely weaken the remaining member. According to Kenneth Waltz, \"The defeat or defection of a major ally would have shaken the balance, each state was constrained to adjust its strategy and the use of its forces to the aims and fears of its partners.\"\n\nThe term is a metaphor deriving from chain gangs, groups of people, usually prisoners or slaves, bound together with chains or other devices as they work or march. Like a real-life chain gang, the states joined together in a chain gang, according to bound obligation, have no option to refuse to follow along with the intent of the others. However, in reality, the members of a chain gang coalition can and sometimes do choose to refuse to acquiesce, in which case they may face international ostracism (at least from the other members of their former alliance), and possibly courtship on the part of rival coalitions. This is because, typically, few punitive actions exists in the realm of international law that can sufficiently compel a power to follow its obligations at all costs, and therefore, the incentives to breaking ranks can sometimes be rather high, especially when the state does not agree with the actions taken by the other members of its coalition.\n\n"}

{"id": "7590953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7590953", "title": "The Worst Journey in the World", "text": "The Worst Journey in the World\n\nThe Worst Journey in the World is a memoir of the 1910–1913 British Antarctic Expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott. It was written and published in 1922 by a member of the expedition, Apsley Cherry-Garrard, and has earned wide praise for its frank treatment of the difficulties of the expedition, the causes of its disastrous outcome, and the meaning (if any) of human suffering under extreme conditions.\n\nIn 1910, Cherry-Garrard and his fellow explorers travelled by sailing vessel, the \"Terra Nova\", from Cardiff to McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. 'Cherry' was teased at first by some of the other members of this expedition because of his lack of Antarctic experience, his lack of specialised credentials for the position of 'assistant zoologist' to which he had been named, and persistent suspicions among some of his comrades that he had in fact bought his way on board by contributing £1,000 to the expedition's troubled funds.\n\nCherry-Garrard responded to these taunts with modesty, a self-sacrificial ability to work hard, and acute observational skills. He was also, according to novelist, biographer, and socialite Nancy Mitford, the only intellectual amongst the crew. These traits were to serve him well when it came time for him to write down his memories of the expedition. They also caught the eye of the expedition's second-in-command, Dr Edward 'Bill' Wilson, who adopted Cherry-Garrard as a protégé.\n\nDr Wilson's personal goal in Antarctica was to recover eggs of the Emperor penguin for scientific study. It was thought at the time that the flightless (and \"primitive\") penguin might shed light on an evolutionary link between reptiles and birds through its embryo. As the bird nests during the Antarctic winter, it was necessary to mount a special expedition in July 1911, from the expedition's base at Cape Evans, to the penguins' rookery at Cape Crozier. Wilson chose Cherry-Garrard to accompany him and 'Birdie' Bowers across the Ross Ice Shelf under conditions of complete darkness and temperatures of −40 °C and below. All three men, barely alive, returned from Cape Crozier with their egg specimens, which were stored. \n\nIt was this \"Winter Journey\", not the later expedition to the South Pole, that Cherry-Garrard later described as \"The Worst Journey in the World\".\n\nThe expedition then swung into preparations for a march from Cape Evans to the as-yet-unreached South Pole. This march was to be done during the Antarctic summer in 1911–1912. Scott's strategy called for a large team of men, ponies, motor sledges and dogs to start out southward from their base, hauling food and fuel on sledges. As the team progressed southward, the leader would successively send support groups back home, leaving a small \"Pole party\" of the fittest men to make the final advance to the South Pole.\n\nCherry-Garrard accompanied the initial team across the Ross Ice Shelf and up the Beardmore Glacier, the slide that discharges ice from the Antarctic Plateau down onto the shelf. At the edge of the polar plateau Scott told him that he would have to return northward. The men not chosen to go on to the Pole all returned to the base camp at Cape Evans. Some returned by ship to Britain; others, including Cherry-Garrard, stayed in the Antarctic and prepared to meet Scott and his four companions on the return journey. But for a variety of reasons, partly described in \"The Worst Journey in the World\", the rendezvous failed. Cherry had been given the task of using the dog teams to meet Scott's party and assist them home, but in fact Cherry-Garrard did not penetrate beyond One Ton Depot, only 11 miles distant from Scott's final location where he and his companions froze to death.\n\nIn 1912–1913 Cherry-Garrard and other expedition members once again marched southward, this time to try to find traces of their lost comrades. Cherry-Garrard's description of the frozen tent that contained three of them is one of the most dramatic sections of the book. Inside the tent were the remains of Scott and Cherry-Garrard's two companions on the \"Worst Journey\", Bowers and Wilson.\n\nIn his book, Cherry-Garrard extensively defends his actions and non-actions, and polar historian Roland Huntford has diagnosed the \"Worst Journey\" as \"an immature but persuasive, highly charged apologia\". Cherry Garrard closes with a written meditation on the themes of self-sacrifice and heroism.\n\nAlthough \"The Worst Journey in the World\" was published only nine years after the end of the \"Terra Nova\" expedition, that short length of time had made clear that new technology, particularly caterpillar-tread vehicles (proposed for snow travel by Scott in a 1908 memorandum and developed by his engineer Reginald Skelton for the 1910 expedition), and later aeroplanes, would revolutionise future work in the Antarctic and make much of the suffering endured by Scott and his men unnecessary. The next visitors to the South Pole ice surface (in October 1956) would arrive and depart by airplane.\n\n\"The Worst Journey in the World\" asks, but does not answer, the question of whether this suffering was futile, or whether it would inspire future human beings facing very different challenges.\n\nThe \"Winter Journey\" to the penguin rookery eventually became a case study on how a paradigm shift in scientific methodology can devalue data that had begun to be gathered before the shift. At the time the \"Terra Nova\" expedition sailed, many biologists believed in recapitulation theory. They believed that examining the embryos of key species, such as the Emperor penguin, would show how the species—and, by extension, how the family of birds as a whole—had evolved. The expedition's chief scientist Wilson determined to try to collect specimens based upon this theory.\n\nAs the survivors of the \"Terra Nova\" returned to England several years later, recapitulation theory had begun to be discredited. Cherry-Garrard turned over the egg specimens to embryologists at London's Natural History Museum, who were largely uninterested in the donation. Cherry-Garrard describes how he was told that the retrieved eggs had not added much to their knowledge of penguin embryology, nor to scientific knowledge as a whole.\n\nIn 1994 \"The Worst Journey in the World\" was published as the first numerical entry in the Picador Travel Classics. The July/August 2001 issue of \"National Geographic Adventure\" listed \"The 100 Best Adventure Books of All Time\", with \"The Worst Journey in the World\" named first.\n\nA drama documentary, also entitled \"The Worst Journey In The World\", written by and starring Mark Gatiss, was broadcast on BBC Four in April 2007.\n\nThe book was also adapted by Stef Penney for the BBC as a two-part radio drama in the Classic Serial strand – it was first broadcast on 21 and 28 September 2008 and directed by Kate McAll. It featured specially-composed music written by Will Gregory, orchestrated by Ian Gardiner and performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under Grant Llewellyn. Cherry-Garrard was played by Matt Green and Scott by John McAndrew, with Carl Prekopp playing Dr Atkinson, Mark Meadows as Captain Oates and Peter Callaghan as Lieutenant Bowers. Other cast included Simon Lee Phillips (Charles Wright), Richard Mitchley (Dr Edward Wilson), Jack Reynolds (PO Tom Crean) and Huw Davies (Taff Evans).\n\n\n"}

It was the ninth Block IIR GPS satellite to be launched, out of thirteen in the original configuration, and twenty one overall. It was built by Lockheed Martin, using the AS-4000 satellite bus.\n\nUSA-168 was launched at 22:09:01 UTC on 31 March 2003, atop a Delta II carrier rocket, flight number D297, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration. The launch took place from Space Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and placed USA-168 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into medium Earth orbit using a Star-37FM apogee motor.\n\nBy 3 April 2003, USA-168 was in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , a period of 720.64 minutes, and 54.9 degrees of inclination to the equator. It is used to broadcast the PRN 21 signal, and operates in slot 3 of plane D of the GPS constellation. The satellite has a mass of , and a design life of 10 years. As of 2012 it remains in service.\n"}

Bioethics is often linked to environmental ethics and stands in sharp contrast to biomedical ethics. Because of this confusion (and appropriation of the term in medicine), Potter chose to use the term \"global bioethics\" in 1988. Awarded the Pfizer Award in Enzyme Chemistry in 1947.\n\n\n\n"}
