BFA is modelled on the World Economic Forum held annually in Davos, Switzerland. Its fixed address is in Bo'ao, Hainan province, China, although the Secretariat is based in Beijing. The forum, sometimes known as the “Asian Davos”, takes its name from the town of Boao, located in China’s southern Hainan province, which has been the permanent venue for its annual conference since 2002.\n\nThe Forum is committed to promoting regional economic integration and bringing Asian countries even closer to their development goals. Initiated in 1998 by Fidel V. Ramos, former President of the Philippines, Bob Hawke, former Prime Minister of Australia, and Morihiro Hosokawa, former Prime Minister of Japan, the Boao Forum for Asia was formally inaugurated in February 2001. The founding of the BFA was driven by the People's Republic of China and founded by 26 Asian and Australasian states on 27 February 2001. The organisation held its first meeting from 12–13 April 2002. \n\nDiscussions at the BFA focus on economics, integration, cooperation, society and the environment. In the past the forum also addressed China's entry into the World Trade Organization, as well as Southeast Asia's economic crisis during the 1990s. The geopolitical strategy 'China's peaceful rise' was a topic of discussion for the forum in 2004. In addition to its annual meeting, the BFA also sponsors other forums and meetings related to Asian issues.\n\nThe Boao Forum For Asia Annual Conference 2008 was held on 10–13 April 2008.

The land is marked by steep-sided hollows, as much as deep in places, which are separated by conical hills and ridges. Maroons who had escaped from plantations used the difficult territory for its natural defenses to develop communities outside the control of Spanish or British colonists. Since 1739 it has been the center of Accompong, an indigenous Maroon community that still has a certain recognized autonomy under the independent Jamaican government.\n\nOn the north, the main defining feature is the fault-based \"Escarpment\", a long ridge that extends from Flagstaff in the west, through Windsor in the centre, to Campbells and the start of the Barbecue Bottom Road (B10). The Barbecue Bottom Road, which runs north-south, high along the side of a deep, fault-based valley in the east, is the only drivable route across the Cockpit Country. Walkers and riders can use two old, historical trails cross further west, the Troy Trail, and the Quick Step Trail. As of 2006 they are seldom used and difficult to find.\n\nIn the southwest, near Quick Step, is the district known as the \"Land of Look Behind.\" It was so named because Spanish horsemen venturing into this region of hostile escaped slaves were said to have ridden two to a mount, one rider facing to the rear to keep a precautionary watch against ambush.\n\nWhere the ridges between sinkholes in the plateau area have dissolved, flat-bottomed basins or valleys have been formed that are filled with terra rosa soils, some of the most productive on the island. The largest basin is the Vale of Clarendon, long and wide. Queen of Spains Valley, Nassau Valley, and Cave Valley were formed by the same process.\n\nShallow caves, known locally as cockpits (based on pits used for cockfights), are particularly common around the hamlet of Quick Step, reaching a density of 15 per km. Noteworthy caves include Marta Tick Cave and Minocal's Glory Hole. Ecotourism has been proposed for the hamlet of Quick Step, at the end of the road into the heart of Cockpit County.\n\nThe Cockpit Country is Jamaica's largest remaining contiguous rainforest. In 1979 an unpublished paper proposed preserving the area as a National Park. In 1994 the geographer Alan Eyre proposed that the Cockpit Country be designated as a World Heritage Site to preserve its environment. A petition for protection of the area was submitted to Prime Minister Bruce Golding in 2006.\n\nAs of April 2013, public consultations have begun on the definition of the boundary proposed in a recently released study by Mitchell, Miller, Ganapathy, and Spence of the University of the West Indies (UWI).\n\n\"Eleutherodactylus sisyphodemus\", a small, critically endangered frog species, is known only from the Cockpit Country. Cockpit Country hosts 90% of the global population of black-billed amazon, a parrot endemic to Jamaica.\n\nCockpit Country is also home to the Jamaican Swallowtail, the largest butterfly in the Western hemisphere. Cockpit Country is one of the last remaining homes for the species.\n\nGeography of Jamaica\n\n"}

It supports and evaluates treatment programmes against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH).\n\nThese parasitic infections are part of a group called “Neglected Tropical Diseases”, which affect the poorest and most marginalised communities in the world. They can impair a child’s development, reduce school attendance and productivity, and even cause internal organ damage.\n\nEstimates suggest that over 1 billion people are infected by these diseases. However, treatment is safe, effective and can reverse the damaging effects of infections, and costs as little as £1 for three people. In fact, the SCI has been recommended by the charity evaluator GiveWell, as one of the world’s most cost-effective non-profits to receive donations.\n\nThe impact of SCI-supported treatment programmes is observed quickly. The number of people infected by these parasites can be reduced by up to 60% after the first round of treatment and sustained below 11% after two rounds of treatment.\n\nSCI continually conducts research to assess programme performance and investigate novel approaches to disease management. This ensures that control strategies are optimised and will ultimately lead to disease elimination.\n\nIn 2002, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations Global Health Programme granted a £20 million award to establish the SCI at Imperial College London. SCI assisted the Ministries of Health and Education to deliver treatment for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis in 6 countries, targeting school-aged children and adults at high risk of infection.\n\nIn 2006, the SCI was a founding partner of the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases which promoted integration of control or elimination programmes against seven NTDs.\n\nBy 2007, the SCI had facilitated delivery of approximately 40 million treatments of praziquantel against schistosomiasis, and many more deworming doses of albendazole.\n\nIn 2010, SCI expanded its reach after the award of the management of ICOSA - a programme funded by the Department for International Development (DFID). ICOSA delivered 203 million treatments against schistosomiasis and STH in 10 sub-Saharan African countries by December 2018.\n\nIn April 2013, SCI announced that it had facilitated delivery of its 100 millionth treatment of praziquantel against schistosomiasis thanks to funding from private donations which complemented the ICOSA award.\n\nBy 2016, SCI had reached an annual delivery of over 50 million treatments for schistosomiasis and STH.\n"}

The film was selected as the Slovak entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.\n\nJakub is a daydreamer in his early 30s and is still living with his father. The father is tired of Jakub's idleness and throws him out of the flat. He tells Jakub to sell the old garden of his grandfather and to buy his own flat. Jakub retires into the neglected garden and retreats into the worn garden house from the world and from his problems. The garden turns out to be a magical place full of surprises and mysteries. Jakub stumbles across his grandfather’s journal which is written in reverse script. He finds a map leading him to an old bottle of slivovice hidden years ago. Now curious Jakub must solve the mysteries of his grandfather’s garden. He meets Helena, a young girl Jakub’s grandfather taught to also write backwards. Strange things happen in the garden, and some of them do indeed seem like miracles. Amid the eccentric events, young Helena teaches Jakub to appreciate the delicate mysteries of life. In the end Jakub loses all his possessions but finds his peace.\n\n\"The Garden\" is one of the most recognised films of post communist Slovakia. It is especially popular in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. It won the Special Jury Prize at the 40th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 1995, and several Czech Lions in 1996.\n\n"}
