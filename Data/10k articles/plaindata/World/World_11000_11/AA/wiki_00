According to the law of Denmark, the patient must be over the age of 18 to decide on an abortion alone; parental consent is required if she is a minor. An abortion can be performed \nafter 12 weeks if the woman's life or health are in danger. A woman may also be granted an authorization to abort after 12 weeks if certain circumstances are proved to be present (such as poor socioeconomic condition of the woman; risk of birth defects to fetus; the pregnancy being the result of rape; mental health risk to mother).\n\nAbortion was first allowed in 1939 by application; if the doctors deemed the pregnancy fell into one of three categories (harmful or fatal to the mother, high risk for birth defects, or a pregnancy borne out of rape), a woman could legally have her pregnancy terminated. A little more than half of the applications received in 1954 and 1955 were accepted; the low acceptance rates were linked to a surge of illegal abortions performed outside the confines of hospitals. An addendum to the 1939 law was passed on 24 March 1970, allowing on-demand abortions only for women under the age of 18 who were deemed \"ill-equipped for motherhood,\" and women over the age of 38.\n\nThe 1973 law is still valid today and nullifies the 1970 law.\n\n, the abortion rate was 12.1 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-49 years, which is below average for the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). The vast majority of Danes support access to legal abortions. In 2007, polls found that 95% supported the right.\n\nAbortion on the Faroe Islands is still governed by the Danish law of 1956, which restricts abortions to the aforementioned three circumstances (pregnancy harmful or fatal to the mother, high risk for birth defects, or a pregnancy borne out of rape). While abortion policy has not formally been devolved to the Faroese Parliament, Danish politicians have been unwilling to force the Danish abortion law on the more conservative Faroese population. The abortion rate in the Faroe Islands is about one-third the rate in Denmark. Additionally, some Faroese women travel to Denmark to have the procedure done.\n\nAbortion in Greenland was legalized on 12 June 1975, under legislation equivalent to the Danish law.\n\nThe abortion rate in Greenland is among the highest in the world, and about 5 times higher than in Denmark, with the number of abortions exceeding live births in some years. Despite being treated as a public health concern, the rate remains high.\n"}

Inspired from the success of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)’s series of post-ministerial conferences launched in the mid-1980s, the APEC was established in 1989 in response to the growing interdependence of Asia-Pacific economies and the advent of regional trade blocs in other parts of the world; and to establish new markets for agricultural products and raw materials beyond Europe. Headquartered in Singapore, the APEC is recognized as the oldest forum and highest-level multilateral bloc in the Asia-Pacific region, and exerts a significant global influence.\n\nAn annual APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting is attended by the heads of government of all APEC members except Republic of China (Taiwan) (which is represented by a ministerial-level official under the name Chinese Taipei as \"economic leader\"). The location of the meeting rotates annually among the member economies, and a famous tradition, followed for most (but not all) summits, involves the attending leaders dressing in a national costume of the host country. APEC has three official observers: the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. APEC's Host Economy of the Year is considered to be invited in the first place for geographical representation to attend G20 meetings following G20 guidelines.\n\nThe APEC was initially inspired when ASEAN’s series of post-ministerial conferences, launched in the mid-1980s, had demonstrated the feasibility and value of regular conferences among ministerial-level representatives of both developed and developing economies. By 1989, the post ministerial conferences had expanded to embrace 12 members (the then six members of ASEAN and its six dialogue partners). The developments led Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke to believe the necessity of region-wide cooperation on economic matters. In January 1989, Bob Hawke called for more effective economic cooperation across the Pacific Rim region. This led to the first meeting of APEC in the Australian capital of Canberra in November, chaired by Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans. Attended by ministers from twelve countries, the meeting concluded with commitments for future annual meetings in Singapore and South Korea. Ten months later, 12 Asia-Pacific economies met in Canberra, Australia, to establish APEC. The APEC Secretariat, based in Singapore, was established to coordinate the activities of the organization.\n\nDuring the meeting in 1994 in Bogor, Indonesia, APEC leaders adopted the Bogor Goals that aim for free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for industrialized economies and by 2020 for developing economies. In 1995, APEC established a business advisory body named the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC), composed of three business executives from each member economy.\n\nIn April 2001, the APEC, in collaboration with five other international organisations (Eurostat, IEA, OLADE, OPEC and the UNSD) launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 became the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI).\n\nThe location of the meeting is rotated annually among the members.\n\nAPEC currently has 21 members. However, the criterion for membership is that the member is a separate \"economy\", rather than a state. As a result, APEC uses the term \"member economies\" rather than \"member countries\" to refer to its members. One result of this criterion is that membership of the forum includes Taiwan (officially the Republic of China, participating under the name \"Chinese Taipei\") alongside People's Republic of China (see Cross-Strait relations), as well as Hong Kong, which entered APEC as a British colony but it is now a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. APEC also includes three official observers: ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council.\n\nIndia has requested membership in APEC, and received initial support from the United States, Japan, Australia and Papua New Guinea. Officials have decided not to allow India to join for various reasons, considering that India does not border the Pacific Ocean, which all current members do. However, India was invited to be an observer for the first time in November 2011.\n\nBangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Macau, Mongolia, Laos, Cambodia, Costa Rica, Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador, are among a dozen other economies that have applied for membership in APEC. Colombia applied for APEC's membership as early as in 1995, but its bid was halted as the organisation stopped accepting new members from 1993 to 1996, and the moratorium was further prolonged to 2007 due to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Guam has also been actively seeking a separate membership, citing the example of Hong Kong, but the request is opposed by the United States, which currently represents Guam.\n\nAPEC has long been at the forefront of reform efforts in the area of business facilitation. Between 2002 and 2006 the costs of business transactions across the region was reduced by 6%, thanks to the APEC Trade Facilitation Action Plan (TFAPI). Between 2007 and 2010, APEC hopes to achieve an additional 5% reduction in business transaction costs. To this end, a new Trade Facilitation Action Plan has been endorsed. According to a 2008 research brief published by the World Bank as part of its Trade Costs and Facilitation Project, increasing transparency in the region's trading system is critical if APEC is to meet its Bogor Goal targets. The APEC Business Travel Card, a travel document for visa-free business travel within the region is one of the concrete measures to facilitate business. In May 2010 Russia joined the scheme, thus completing the circle.\n\nAPEC first formally started discussing the concept of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) at its summit in 2006 in Hanoi. However, the proposal for such an area has been around since at least 1966 and Japanese economist 's proposal for a Pacific Free Trade agreement proposal. While it gained little traction, the idea led to the formation of Pacific Trade and Development Conference and then the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council in 1980 and then APEC in 1989.\n\nIn the wake of the 2006 summit, economist C. Fred Bergsten advocated a Free Trade Agreement of Asia-Pacific, including the United States amongst the proposed parties to any agreement at that time. His ideas convinced the APEC Business Advisory Council to support this concept. Relatedly, ASEAN and existing free trade agreement (FTA) partners are negotiating as Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), not officially including Russia. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) without China or Russia involved has become the US-promoted trade negotiation in the region. At the APEC summit in Beijing in 2014, the three plans were all in discussion. President Obama hosted a TPP meeting at the US Embassy in Beijing in advance of the APEC gathering.\n\nThe proposal for a FTAAP arose due to the lack of progress in the Doha round of World Trade Organization negotiations, and as a way to overcome the \"noodle bowl\" effect created by overlapping and conflicting elements of the copious free trade agreements — there were approximately 60 free trade agreements in 2007, with an additional 117 in the process of negotiation in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2012, ASEAN+6 countries alone had 339 free trade agreements - many of which were bilateral.\n\nThe FTAAP is more ambitious in scope than the Doha round, which limits itself to reducing trade restrictions. The FTAAP would create a free trade zone that would considerably expand commerce and economic growth in the region. The economic expansion and growth in trade could exceed the expectations of other regional free trade areas such as the ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN + China, South Korea and Japan). Some criticisms include that the diversion of trade within APEC members would create trade imbalances, market conflicts and complications with nations of other regions. The development of the FTAAP is expected to take many years, involving essential studies, evaluations and negotiations between member economies. It is also affected by the absence of political will and popular agitations and lobbying against free trade in domestic politics.\n\nAt the 2014 APEC summit in Beijing, APEC leaders agreed to launch \"a collective strategic study\" on the FTAAP and instruct officials to undertake the study, consult stakeholders and report the result by the end of 2016. APEC Executive Director Alan Bollard revealed in the Elite Talk show that FTAAP will be APEC's big goal out into the future.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership includes 12 of the 21 APEC members and has provisions for the accession of other APEC members, five of which have expressed interest in membership.\n\nIn 1993, APEC Leaders decided to establish a network of APEC Study Centres among universities and research institutions in member economies.\n\nNotable centers include:\n\nThe APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) was created by the APEC Economic Leaders in November 1995 with the aim of providing advice to the APEC Economic Leaders on ways to achieve the Bogor Goals and other specific business sector priorities, and to provide the business perspective on specific areas of cooperation.\n\nEach economy nominates up to three members from the private sector to ABAC. These business leaders represent a wide range of industry sectors. ABAC provides an annual report to APEC Economic Leaders containing recommendations to improve the business and investment environment in the Asia-Pacific region, and outlining business views about priority regional issues. ABAC is also the only non-governmental organization that is on the official agenda of the APEC Economic Leader's Meeting.\nSince its formation in 1989, APEC has held annual meetings with representatives from all member economies. The first four annual meetings were attended by ministerial-level officials. Beginning in 1993, the annual meetings are named APEC Economic Leaders' Meetings and are attended by the heads of government from all member economies except Taiwan, which is represented by a ministerial-level official. The annual Leaders' Meetings are not called summits.\n\nIn 1997, the APEC meeting was held in Vancouver. Controversy arose after officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police used pepper spray against protesters. The protesters objected to the presence of autocratic leaders such as Indonesian president Suharto.\n\nAt the 2001 Leaders' Meeting in Shanghai, APEC leaders pushed for a new round of trade negotiations and support for a program of trade capacity-building assistance, leading to the launch of the Doha Development Agenda a few weeks later. The meeting also endorsed the Shanghai Accord proposed by the United States, emphasising the implementation of open markets, structural reform, and capacity building. As part of the accord, the meeting committed to develop and implement APEC transparency standards, reduce trade transaction costs in the Asia-Pacific region by 5 percent over 5 years, and pursue trade liberalisation policies relating to information technology goods and services.\n\nIn 2003, Jemaah Islamiah leader Riduan Isamuddin had planned to attack the APEC Leaders Meeting to be held in Bangkok in October. He was captured in the city of Ayutthaya, Thailand by Thai police on August 11, 2003, before he could finish planning the attack.\nChile became the first South American nation to host the Leaders' Meeting in 2004. The agenda of that year was focused on terrorism and commerce, small and medium enterprise development, and contemplation of free agreements and regional trade agreements.\n\nThe 2005 Leaders' Meeting was held in Busan, South Korea. The meeting focused on the Doha round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, leading up to the WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005 held in Hong Kong in December. Weeks earlier, trade negotiations in Paris were held between several WTO members, including the United States and the European Union, centred on reducing agricultural trade barriers. APEC leaders at the summit urged the European Union to agree to reducing farm subsidies. In a continuation of the climate information sharing initiative established by APEC Climate Network working group, it was decided by the leaders to install the APEC Climate Center in Busan. Peaceful protests against APEC were staged in Busan, but the meeting schedule was not affected.\n\nAt the Leaders' Meeting held on November 19, 2006 in Hanoi, APEC leaders called for a new start to global free-trade negotiations while condemning terrorism and other threats to security. APEC also criticised North Korea for conducting a nuclear test and a missile test launch that year, urging the country to take \"concrete and effective\" steps toward nuclear disarmament. Concerns about nuclear proliferation in the region was discussed in addition to economic topics. The United States and Russia signed an agreement as part of Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe APEC Australia 2007 Leaders' Meeting was held in Sydney from 2–9 September 2007. The political leaders agreed to an \"aspirational goal\" of a 25% reduction of energy intensity correlative with economic development. Extreme security measures including airborne sharpshooters and extensive steel-and-concrete barricades were deployed against anticipated protesters and potential terrorists. However, protest activities were peaceful and the security envelope was penetrated with ease by a spoof diplomatic motorcade manned by members of the Australian television program \"The Chaser\", one of whom was dressed to resemble the Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe APEC USA 2011 Leaders' Meeting was held on Honolulu, Hawaii 8–13 November 2011.\n\nAt the end of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting the leaders gather for the official APEC Leaders' Family Photo. A tradition has the leaders dressing to reflect the culture of the host member. The tradition dates to the first such meeting in 1993 when then-U.S. President Bill Clinton insisted on informal attire and gave the leaders leather bomber jackets. At the 2010 meeting Japan had the leaders dress in smart casual rather than the traditional kimono. Similarly, when Honolulu was selected in 2009 as the site for the 2011 APEC meeting, U.S. President Barack Obama joked that he looked forward to seeing the leaders dressed in \"flowered shirts and grass skirts\". After viewing previous photos, and concerned that having the leaders dress in aloha shirts might give the wrong impression during a period of economic austerity, Obama instead decided it might be time to end the tradition. Leaders were given a specially designed aloha shirt as a gift but were not expected to wear it for the photo. Leaders in Bali, Indonesia at the 2013 conference wore a batik outfit; in China 2014 Tang suit jackets; in Peru 2016 vicuna wool shawls; in 2017 Vietnamese silk shirts.\n\nAPEC has been criticised for promoting free trade agreements that would impose restrictions on national and local laws, which regulate and ensure labor rights, environmental protection and safe and affordable access to medicine. According to the organization, it is \"the premier forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region\" established to \"further enhance economic growth and prosperity for the region and to strengthen the Asia-Pacific community\". The effectiveness and fairness of its role has been questioned, especially from the viewpoints of European countries that cannot take part in APEC and Pacific Island nations that cannot participate but stand to be affected by its decisions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

From this, Sen concludes that real development cannot be reduced to simply increasing basic incomes, nor to rising average per capita incomes. Rather, it requires a package of overlapping mechanisms that progressively enable the exercise of a growing range of freedoms.\n\nHis work has been criticized by those who claim that capitalism—and especially neo-liberal capitalism—reinforce unfreedoms.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "494665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=494665", "title": "Foxtel", "text": "Foxtel\n\nFoxtel is an Australian pay television company, operating in cable television, direct broadcast satellite television, and IPTV streaming services. It was formed in 1995 through a joint venture established between News Corporation (now News Corp; through News Limited, now News Corp Australia) (FOX) and Telstra (TEL). With Fox being the 65% and Telstra the 35% shareholders. It shares many features with the Sky service in the United Kingdom, including iQ, the electronic program guide, a similar remote control, and Red Button Active.\n\nIn 1995, a venture between News Corporation (in particular 20th Century Fox Media) and Telstra took place whereby Telstra would transmit a TV signal through its coaxial network and News Corporation would be the basis for offering channel negotiations and connections. Foxtel was formed (\"Fox\" representing News Corporation's Fox and \"Tel\" representing Telstra)...\nOn 23 October 1995, Foxtel commenced a 20 channel service, delivered over the Telstra Hybrid Fibre Coaxial network.\n\nIn May 1998, Australis Media, the owner of a satellite television service known as Galaxy, was declared insolvent. In June 1998, Foxtel was able to significantly boost its customer base by acquiring Galaxy subscribers from the liquidator of Australis Media and immediately commenced supplying programming to Galaxy's subscribers on an interim basis. In February 1999, Foxtel began offering its own satellite service to new customers.\n\nPublishing and Broadcasting Limited bought half of News Corporation's shares in October 1998, giving each quarter ownership.\n\nIn 2002, a Content Sharing Agreement between Foxtel and Optus Television was approved by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\n\nOn 11 July 2011, Austar announced that \"it had entered into definitive transaction agreements with Liberty Global, Inc. (LGI) and Foxtel Management Pty Limited (Foxtel) under which Foxtel will acquire Austar by a series of transactions including a scheme of arrangement (Scheme).\" This takeover involved a minority shareholder approval on 30 March 2012, the approval of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) on 10 April 2012, and has had approval from a Second Court Hearing. Austar shares were suspended from the ASX on 16 April 2012 and delisted on 27 April 2012. The takeover was completed on 24 May 2012.\n\nNews Corporation acquired Consolidated Media Holdings in November 2012, bringing its stake in Foxtel to 50%, up from 25%.\n\nOn 15 June 2015, Foxtel officially agreed to buyout 15% shares in Ten Network Holdings, subject to approval from the ACCC. Prior to the acquisition, Discovery backed out from bidding partnership with Foxtel.\n\nIn June 2017, Foxtel announced that it would be undergoing a major rebrand – the first in its 22-year history – as part of a move to convey an image that \"Foxtel is for everyone\". The former logo (inspired from the American Fox network's 1996-present logo), described by the company as \"quite aggressive, quite arrogant, quite elitist\", would be replaced with an all lowercase logo, and its Foxtel Play service would rebranded to Foxtel Now.\n\nOn 6 March 2018, News Corp Australia announced a merger of Fox Sports (Australia) with Foxtel (co-owned by News Corp Australia and Telstra). News Corp owns a 65 percent stake in the combined entity, with Telstra owning 35 percent. The combining of the two businesses places emphasis on live-streaming sports and entertainment.\n\nFoxtel grew rapidly in 2007, with most of Foxtel's highest-ever rating events being broadcast that year, including the 2007 AFC Asian Cup quarter-final between Australia and Japan, which drew an average of 419,000 viewers, an Australian pay television record at that time. This ratings record has since been eclipsed by the 2011 Rugby World Cup on Fox Sports 1 averaging around 500,000 viewers, which was smashed by the 2012 London Olympics Coverage, broadcast on 8 dedicated channels in both HD and SD formats, which saw an average of 946,432 viewers tuning in on the opening weekend, with around 600,000 to 700,000 viewers nightly thereafter.\n\nAs of 2012, Fox Sports channels, particularly Fox Footy, average between 90,000 and 300,000 + viewers for NRL/AFL matches throughout the week.\nThe highest-rated light entertainment shows are The Simpsons most weeknights on FOX8 with around 110,000 viewers, as well as Family Guy with around 70,000 viewers. A&E has also recorded healthy audience numbers for its TruTV & A&E US syndicated shows from the US – Pawn Stars (85,000), Hardcore Pawn (85,000), and Storage Wars (90,000). BBC UKTV also consistently rates well with British soaps EastEnders (80,000) and Coronation Street (65,000). The LifeStyle channel has experienced audiences in excess of 100,000 people for its Premiere shows Location, Location, Location Australia, Grand Designs Australia, Selling Houses Australia, Disney Channel (Australia) and The Real Housewives of Melbourne brings strong ratings.\n\nFoxtel transmits its cable service via Telstra hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) cable into the Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth metropolitan areas, along with the Gold Coast. Foxtel now also transmits its satellite service into these cities as well as all over Australia including regional areas since the takeover of Austar, previous Austar customers are now 100% Foxtel customers with the conversion from Austar to Foxtel in regional Australia is now complete, however, satellite service is not supplied to user sites where Telstra HFC cable is available in metropolitan areas. Foxtel on Mobile launched on Telstra's Next G Network in late 2006 and is now available within Telstra Next G (HSDPA/850 MHz) coverage areas, which covers 99% of the population.\n\nTelstra's network and Foxtel were created to combat the threat posed to Telstra's local call business by the combination of Optus Vision (now known as Optus TV) content bundling with Optus' local telephony services; Foxtel was the content arm of Telstra's defence strategy, while Telstra's multimedia broadband network was originally the sole delivery system.\n\nIn 2002, Foxtel and Optus Television agreed to a content-sharing arrangement. Programming competition between the two companies has now dissipated. Prior to its acquisition by Foxtel in 2011, Austar, a regional pay television operator, also carried most Foxtel programming.\n, Foxtel is Australia's largest pay television operator, with programming available to over 70% of Australian homes, and delivered to over 1.65 million, either directly or by Foxtel's wholesale customers. In April 2008, Foxtel's penetration into Australian homes passed 30%. This penetration rate is significantly lower compared with market penetration rates in the US (over 85%) and in Western Europe (over 55%). This is due to the fact that Australian pay-TV fees are significantly more expensive and pay-TV began delivering its service much later in Australia than in the US.\n\nFoxtel announced its maiden annual profit in 2006, more than 10 years after it commenced services. The installation and maintenance of Foxtel services is Telstra's responsibility. In many markets Telstra has outsourced installation and maintenance to large communications contractors, including ABB Communications and Siemens-Thiess Communications Joint Venture.\n\nIn 2007, Network Ten formed an agreement with Foxtel to allow them to carry a digital version of Ten's programming. Included in the deal is electronic program guide data, which allows Foxtel iQ users to schedule recordings on Ten. Before the agreement, Ten was carried in an analogue format on cable only.\n\nIn 2008, Seven Network finally entered an agreement to allow Foxtel to carry its SD signal.\n\nIn 2008, the first Pay TV package comparison site YouCompare was launched to allow Foxtel packages and pricing to be compared to SelecTV, however this service was ceased along with the ceasing of SelecTV's service in late 2010.\n\nOn 15 November 2009, Foxtel released an additional 25 channels to satellite and cable subscribers, consisting of high definition channels, movie and theme channels, and several new time-shifted channels. As part of the release, Seven began broadcasting to satellite subscribers in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.\n\nOn 24 November 2009, Foxtel added 7TWO to the East Coast (satellite) and 7TWO and GO! to cable subscribers. ABC3 was recently introduced on 4 December 2009 to all Foxtel and Austar subscribers.\n\nOn 20 May 2010, Foxtel and Microsoft announced a new way of receiving Foxtel through Xbox 360's online service Xbox LIVE. The service launched November 2010 with 30+ channels and an additional 12 Video-on-demand channels. It also provided Foxtel's movie service, known as Foxtel On Demand, to non-subscribers for the first time on a pay-per-view basis. Further linear channels were added in April 2011 with the addition of 7 Telstra BigPond channels.\n\nIn June 2011, Foxtel launched an over-the-top service on Telstra's IPTV set top box called Foxtel on T-Box carrying the same services as the Foxtel on Xbox service. Also as of June 2011, Foxtel's subscribers numbered just over 1.65 million.\n\nIn November 2014, Foxtel added 2 new SD channels, 9 new HD channels and rebranded 2 sports channels to satellite and cable subscribers.\n\nFoxtel defines a virtual channel order that groups channels by their content.\n\nGeneral entertainment channels are from 100 to 149 which includes metropolitan/state-based localised advertising primary channels the Nine Network, ABC, SBS, the Seven Network and Network 10, with metropolitan/state-based localised advertising multichannels ABC Comedy/ABC Kids, 7TWO, 7mate, 9Go!, 10 Boss, 10 Peach, SBS Viceland, and SBS Food, NITV as well as national channels TV Hits, Arena, LifeStyle, Fox8, 111 funny, Fox Classics, Fox Showcase, Boxsets, Binge, and MTV.

Originally, it was only available on iPad, but from 20 February 2013 it was also available on iPhone, and later on Mac, Windows PC and selected Android devices. Foxtel Go was launched after the success of its London 2012 app, which simulcast 8 live high definition channels that were also offered on the standard Foxtel service.\n\nAccess to the Foxtel app is free for residential customers with a set-top box and a Foxtel or Foxtel Now subscription, allowing access to any channel that they are subscribed to. The Sky News service can be accessed through the service without an account. Only five devices can be linked to an account during any given month with only two being able to view content at the same time, and only one device change is permitted per month.\n\nUnlike Mobile Foxtel (provided by Telstra) – which only provides a loop of selected shows – the Foxtel app offers a live simulcast of the channels available through the traditional cable and satellite services. The service also has no time limits; Mobile Foxtel offers only 15 minutes of programming per session, or a maximum 200 minutes per month.\n\nThe channels currently available to subscribers are:\n\nEntertainment – Fox 8; UKTV; Arena; MTV; Universal; TVH!TS; 111 funny; Lifestyle; Discovery Channel; National Geographic; Disney Junior, Nick Jr.; Boomerang; [V] Hits; Max; Country Music Channel; Sky News; Your Money; Sky News Weather; Fox Sports News; CNN; BBC World News; CNBC.\n\nEntertainment Plus – The Comedy Channel; Syfy; Style; TLC; E!; A&E; Lifestyle Food; Lifestyle You; Lifestyle Home.\n\nKids – Disney Channel; Cartoon Network; CBeebies; Nickelodeon; Discovery Kids; Disney XD.\n\nEnglish Club Channels – Chelsea TV; Liverpool FC TV; Manchester United FC TV.\n\nDrama – Fox Showcase; BBC First; Binge; 13th Street; BoxSets.\n\nSport – Fox Cricket; Fox League; Fox Sports 3; Fox Footy (not available on PC/Mac); Fox Sports 5; and Fox Sports 6; Fox Sports Plus 1-4; Eurosport; ESPN; ESPN 2; BeIN Sports 1-3.\n\nMovies – Premiere; Disney; Action; Comedy; Romance; Family; Masterpiece; More; Thriller; World Movies.\n\nDocos – History; Nat Geo Wild; Discovery Turbo; Nat Geo People; Animal Planet; Discovery Science; Crime + Investigation; BBC Knowledge.\n\nThe Foxtel app also offers an on demand service for most channels listed above except for sports channels.\n\nFoxtel Now (Formerly Foxtel Play) is an internet television alternative to the traditional Foxtel subscription, offering customers a no lock in contract subscription starting at $10. The service offers over 50 live channels and hundreds of hours of video on-demand content across 6 subscription packages.\n\nThe service is available across a range of devices such as computers, TVs and video game consoles.

Features include: remote record for iQ and iQ2, free to air listings, program descriptions and classifications. The application is free to download from the iPhone App Store and is available to non-subscribers (with the exception of the ability to remote record). On 25 February 2011, Foxtel released an Android application which is available as a free app from Google Play. The app is optimised for both Android smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe Foxtel magazine contains daily listings for most channels offered on the Foxtel platform.\n\nFoxtel subscribers can opt-in and subscribe to the Foxtel magazine for a monthly fee. Legacy Foxtel Platinum subscribers who opted in for the magazine prior to the Platinum magazine unbundling period in mid-2010, currently still continue to get the magazine free of charge.\n\nFoxtel's magazine is Australia's most-read paid-for monthly magazine, with a monthly reach of about 700,000. It is published for Foxtel by Medium Rare Content Agency, and distributed to Foxtel subscribers (who choose to pay for this service) by via post.\n\nFoxtel no longer offers the magazine free to new \"Platinum\" subscribers. The change to this policy was introduced by Foxtel to reduce physical waste (paper and associated environmental impact) from printing the monthly magazine, and to reduce monthly costs associated with printing and posting overhead for the Foxtel magazine, to all legacy Platinum customers who decided not to opt-in during the opt-in period in early 2010.\n\nAs of February 2016, the magazine no longer lists the sports channels.\n\nIn August 2018, Foxtel launched a streaming VOD (video on demand) movie service called FoxFlicks. This service is available to subscribers who have either the movie pack or platinum pack with an iQ3 or iQ4 set-top-box.\n\nFoxtel launched its digital service (Foxtel Digital) in March 2004. The service is loosely based on another of News Corporation's subscription providers, BSkyB. Features of the digital service include:\n\nLike many other News Corporation-owned digital platforms, Foxtel uses NDS Group encryption system, electronic program guide and digital video recorder services, the OpenTV interactive platform, and primarily runs on Pace Micro Technology set-top boxes.\n\nFoxtel's satellite service transmits exclusively from the Optus C1 satellite on a primary downlink frequency of 12.438 GHz expanded to adjacent frequencies, with further expansion during November 2009 of frequencies on the Optus D3 satellite. The Telstra hybrid fibre-coaxial cable carries Foxtel with an approximate downstream bandwidth of 560 MHz with an upstream return (for internet, on-demand, phone and other two-way dependent services) bandwidth of 2.4 MHz.\n\nAs of April 2007, all Foxtel subscribers are using the digital set-up, making Foxtel Digital synonymous with the standard Foxtel service.\n\nFoxtel announced their High Definition service originally called Foxtel HD+ on 30 January 2008, and became officially available on 19 May 2008 at a nominal price of $10 AUD despite similar \"HD\" resolution broadcast channels already available on free-to-air television.

As of 2011, almost a third of Foxtel's customers were receiving the HD service.\n\nFoxtel on Demand was a service offered by Foxtel to iQ subscribers that allowed people to watch selected shows and movies whenever they wanted. Foxtel on Demand was launched on 8 February 2007, with a variety of programmes and included the entire second season of \"Love My Way\".\n\nThe service was available to all Foxtel customers with an iQ set top unit, however the programming able to be played was typically restricted to the channels that the customer was subscribed to. For example, customers not subscribed to the movie channels were not able to view the stored movies.\n\nOn 1 October 2009, Foxtel launched an online download service which allows all cable and satellite customers to access Foxtel content via their computer. The service is free for customers, who can download programs from channels within their subscription package. There is currently one live streaming channel, ESPN3, while the remainder of the service provides episodes of programs from 38 channels. Then CEO, Kim Williams, highlighted that Foxtel planned to expand its live streaming channel range later in the year to coincide with the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics and the launch of thirty new channels for Foxtel Digital and HD. This service has been the source of great controversy as there was no support for Linux, Mac or any 64 bit Windows Operating Systems, leaving many users unable to install the client.\nFoxtel Download was discontinued in September 2012, with the service no longer being available to subscribers.\n\nLaunched in late 2006 to coincide with Telstra's NextG 3G Mobile phone network, Mobile Foxtel (previously Foxtel By Mobile) offers 33 standard channels of programming for a small subscription fee, optimised for mobile devices. At present the channels available are: Sky News National, Your Money, CNN, Fox Sports News, Fox8, The Comedy Channel, MTV, E! Entertainment, Fashion TV, Discovery Mobile, Disney Channel, Eurosport, Union Extreme Sports, Cartoon Network, TV1, National Geographic, ABC, SBS One and Eurosportnews.\n\nWith the exception of CNN, Fashion TV, Eurosportsnews, Eurosport, Fox News, BBC World News and Fox Sports News, which are direct simulcasts of the actual channel and Sky News channels which are taken from the Sky News Active service, all channels are pre-produced loops that do not directly correlate to the full scale satellite/cable channel. At present, a limit of 200 minutes per month, with 15 minutes per session, may apply to the service, although this has not been strictly enforced.\n\nThe service was discontinued on 27 July 2016.\n\nFoxtel launched in November 2010 for the Xbox 360 games console, offering 38 channels, catch-up television and on-demand movie streaming. It requires both an Xbox Live Gold subscription and a Foxtel subscription. Samsung Smart TVs received the same service at no additional cost in July 2012. This has been replaced with Foxtel Now.\n\nIn 2014, Foxtel launched a movie streaming operation \"Presto\", which was initially priced at AU$19.99, but was halved a few months later. Presto was spin-off a television streaming service with Seven West Media in early 2015.\n\nFoxtel announced the Presto service will be closed in January 2017, and customers moved to a Foxtel Now service.\n\nFoxtel devices are manufactured by Pace plc on behalf of Foxtel - they have manufactured a verity of devices including:\n\nThere is a variety of Foxtel standard units. These lack the recording features of the iQ models, but can be connected to a VCR or DVR. Foxtel has phased out the standard boxes for all new installations and installs the iQHD instead. The additional features of the iQ models (such as recording) can be deactivated if the customer does not wish to pay for them, in effect making them operate as if they were a standard model.\n\nFoxtel launched Foxtel iQ in early 2005. It is a timeshifting personal digital recorder in which subscribers are able to record programs onto a hard drive inside the set-top unit for later viewing. Foxtel iQ includes a feature called Series Link, which lets the viewer choose to record all future episodes in a given television series (availability is limited to certain programmes). Foxtel iQ also allows viewers to use live rewind and pause features during television programmes. Two new services, On Demand and Remote Record, launched in 2007. Remote Record was launched on 1 January 2007 and allows users to log into the interactive TV guide on the Foxtel website and then command their iQ at home to record shows, while on Demand was launched on 8 February 2007. This service is based on Sky+, which was launched on News Corporation's UK television platform Sky in 2001.\nThere are currently two models of Foxtel iQ, with identical functionality to the user but different audio-visual output abilities. Both models have two tuners, allowing users to record two programs (or record one and watch one) simultaneously.\nPace plc are the set top box provider for iQ, of which they claim that the cable version of iQ is the first DVB-based cable digital video recorder.\n\nThe updated version of the original iQ unit is physically smaller, however allows for better quality recordings and HDMI up-scaling as well as an Ethernet Port to allow Box Office downloads and it can also order On Demand titles without the need of the phone line connected to the model. Within Foxtel and Telstra, these boxes are referred to as iQ 1.5 to differentiate them from the original IQ boxes. As of 1 March 2017, These Boxes Are No Longer Available to new Customers.\n\nFoxtel's second generation iQ, the Foxtel iQ2 was launched alongside the Foxtel HD+ service in mid-2008. Equipped with a 320GB HDD, iQ2 is capable of recording 30 hours of HD and 90 hours of SD content and offers, double that of the original iQ. The unit also offers HDMI connectivity.\n\nThe iQHD is equipped with four tuners, allowing users to record two programs at once while watching a third live. The fourth tuner is reserved for on demand content.\n\nAs of 2011, 75 percent of Foxtel subscribers are using an iQ series unit, 40 percent are using Multi-Room, and 40% are using iQ2 (and therefore, HD).\n\nOn 2 November 2011, Foxtel started notifying subscribers of the option to upgrade (at an additional one-off $200 upgrade fee) to the new iQHD 1TB model with 4 times the recording capacity.\n\nFoxtel's third generation iQ model, iQ3, was first referenced by CEO Richard Freudenstein in March 2012, and was released to customers on 23 March 2015. The iQ3 contains increased internet connectivity with the inclusion of WiFi, the ability to rewind to the beginning of a program midway through a program even if the viewer was not viewing the channel at the time of the start of the program. The iQ3 includes a 1TB HDD (3x the capacity of the previous iQHD) and a bluetooth remote. After the release, many customers had complaints due to the unstable nature of the iQ3 graphical user interface and have accused Foxtel of releasing an 'unfinished product'. Foxtel denied such claims as newfound market rival Netflix emerged. As of November 2015, instability issues are yet to be resolved.\nFoxtel's fourth generation iQ model, iQ4 was launched in August 2018 and is 4K compatible. Foxtel launched Foxtel 4K, a dedicated 4K channel on October 7th 2018, with the broadcast of the Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000.\n\nWhen Foxtel was launched in 1995, advertising during programs was banned under Australian Government legislation for the first two years. Foxtel has since significantly increased advertising across its platform, although still today legislation prevents Foxtel and other pay TV businesses from earning more than 50% of their revenue from advertising, sometimes viewers are exposed to up to 5min worth of adverts for every 8 minutes of programming. Certain programming on select channels are broadcast commercial-free such as movies on their movie channels and selected games on Fox Sports but in-between each program Foxtel would then stream many ads giving a long time between the end of one movie and the start of the next.\n\nEOFYS (pronounced \\ 'E o f\\os') is an acronym originating from Australia referring to an \"End of Financial Year Sale\". Its first use was in a 2009 Foxtel advertising campaign created by Three Drunk Monkeys. Since the Foxtel advertisement, other Australian businesses and advertising firms have taken licence to adopt the term, and it has become an acceptable part of the Australian lexicon and verbal nomenclature referring to businesses offerings before the Australian financial year end on 30 June.\n\nThe Australian anti-siphoning laws also prevent Foxtel and other pay TV suppliers from acquiring exclusive rights to specific sporting events such as cricket, golf, tennis and the football codes. Under the legislation pay TV licensees are prevented from bidding for major sporting events until a right is acquired by the ABC, SBS or a free-to-air commercial network. In 2009, the Minister for Communications announced a review of the legislation. In an Olympics year, the Australian anti-siphoning list runs to over 1300 events and is one of the longest in the world.\n\nFoxtel prevents users from using their subscription card in a third-party decoder, and requires all users to watch the service on a supplied set-top box, included with the subscription, however some users have reported being able to watch certain channels on a computer with a DVB-C card and using sasc-ng to decrypt the video content using card readers to read the decoding keys stored on the card used in Foxtel's iQ.\n\nOn 24 May 2012, Foxtel merged with Austar, resulting in Foxtel gaining Austar's shares in XYZnetworks (which Foxtel closed and created Foxtel Networks), as well as their shares in Main Event.\nThe channels owned by Foxtel include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22231254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22231254", "title": "GPS in the earthmoving industry", "text": "GPS in the earthmoving industry\n\nGPS when applied in the earthmoving industry can be a viable asset to contractors and increase the overall efficiency of the job. Since GPS satellite positioning information is free to the public, it allows for everyone to take advantage of its uses. Heavy equipment manufacturers in conjunction with GPS guidance system manufacturers have been co-developing GPS guidance systems for heavy equipment since the late 1990s. These systems allow the equipment operator to use GPS position data to make decisions based on actual grade and design features. Some heavy equipment guidance systems can even operate the machine's implements automatically from a set design that was created for the particular jobsite. GPS guidance systems can have tolerances as small as two to three centimeters making them extremely accurate compared to relying on the operator's skill level. Since the machine's GPS system has the ability to know when it's off the design grade, this can reduce surveying and material costs required for a specific job.\n\nGPS Technology was officially introduced as a guidance system for earthmoving machines in the late 1990s. Since this time, many manufacturers of earthmoving equipment now offer GPS and other guidance systems, as a factory option. Many companies exist that also sell GPS guidance systems for the earthmoving industry as a retrofit option. The two main companies for heavy equipment guidance systems are Trimble and Topcon. In April 2002, Trimble and Caterpillar Inc. began a joint venture known as Caterpillar Trimble Controls Technology LLC (CTCT). \"The joint venture develops machine control products that use site design information combined with accurate positioning technology to automatically control dozer blades and other machine tools\". Though aftermarket kits were available from various companies to retrofit an existing machine for GPS guidance, Caterpillar Inc. was the first heavy equipment manufacturer to offer GPS guidance systems as a factory option from the dealer called an ARO (Attachment Ready Option). John Deere soon followed with their own version of ARO called \"Integrated Grade Control\" in 2006 on many Track-Type Tractors (TTT) and Motorgraders (MG).\n\nWhile there are various GPS systems currently used in the heavy equipment industry, they can typically be categorized as either \"indicate only\" or \"fully automatic\". Both systems can utilize one or two GPS receivers. Using only one GPS receiver limits how the guidance system can orient the machine's position in respect to the site design. Using two GPS receivers gives the guidance system two points of position allowing it to calculate what angle the machine is on relative to the site plan. The following describes \"indicate only\" and \"fully automatic\" in more detail.\n\nIndicate only uses GPS positioning information as a guide to the operator. Depending on the system used, the machine position can be displayed over the specific design site that was created for the earthmoving project. This system relies on the operator to steer and move the machine's implements in order to match the site's design. Indicate only systems are typically cheaper and less complicated since they don't require hardware to tap into the machine's implement control systems. Indicate only systems typically utilize a single GPS receiver mounted on the machine itself and can use an angle sensor to calculate the machine's slope. Accuracy of these systems depends on if the site has a base station that can relay site specific corrections. If the site does not have a base station, indicate only systems can just use satellite information, however the accuracy is usually in the one to two meter range. Utilizing a base station allows for site specific corrections to be transmitted to the machine, increasing the accuracy through Real Time Kinematics (RTK). Site specific corrections can increase the accuracy of an indicate only system to be around two to three centimeters. Machines that typically use indicate only consist of Soil Compactors (SC), Track-Type Tractors (TTT), and Motor Graders (MG). The use of a base station really depends on the accuracy requirements of the project. Some projects such as clearing overburden at a mine site with a TTT, may not need two to three centimeter accuracy while as grading a road base with a MG does.\n\nFully automatic systems allow the ability of the machine's implements to be controlled by the GPS guidance system. This is typically used in the fine grading applications where precise levels of material need to be moved on a predetermined design or grade. The advantages to this system is due to the accuracy that can be achieved with GPS and RTK, but requires an onsite base station. These systems can use either one or two GPS receivers and are mounted on the machine's blade. The more advanced systems use two receivers since it allows the machine to be controlled in a three-dimensional design. Fully automatic systems require the GPS guidance system to be integrated in the machine's implement controls. Some manufacturers sell the machine with these controls already integrated into the machine as an option. Aftermarket kits are available that can retrofit your existing machine to fully automatic control, but requires the GPS system to interface with the machine's implement controls. This is typically done one of two ways. If the machine's implements are controlled using electric over hydraulic (EH), the GPS system can input lever commands in parallel with the machine's implement lever. The output from the GPS system is interpreted by the machine's electronic control module as a lever command given by the operator and moves the implements accordingly. The second method for integrating GPS in the machine's implement controls is by adding a second pilot hydraulic valve in parallel with the machine's pilot hydraulic valve. This second valve is controlled by the GPS system and moves the implement valve according to the system design and blade location. Types of machines that use fully automatic GPS systems include TTT and MG.\n\nThe key to successfully using GPS in the earthmoving industry is having an accurate site design. The site design, typically created by an engineering firm, can be imported from the original design file into the machine's GPS display. Most GPS guidance systems also have the ability to allow the operator to define a specific grade elevation or grade angle without a specific design. The following describes common machine applications that utilize GPS guidance systems.\n\nTrack-Type Tractors\nTTT are an extremely popular machine platform for GPS guidance systems specifically in the smaller sized models that are used for fine grading. Caterpillar Inc. and John Deere both offer fully automatic integrated GPS as an option from the factory on some of these models. One example of GPS being used on a TTT would be on a road project.\n\nMotorgraders are another popular machine platform since they also perform fine grading activities that can benefit from the GPS accuracy. Caterpillar Inc. and John Deere also offer some models with integrated GPS.\n\nHydraulic excavators are just beginning to be integrated using GPS technology and are typically indicate only. Excavators use GPS technology in conjunction with angle sensors integrated in the machine's boom, stick, and bucket. This allows the operator to see how deep they are digging by comparing the actual bucket location to the site design on the GPS display.\nIn recent years, Komatsu has released excavators offering semi-automatic functions. With these functions, the machine will automatically raise the boom and bucket to maintain the predetermined design grade. These machines also offer an auto stop function, preventing the bucket and boom function from lower beyond the predetermined design grade. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ELceB420I\n\nScrapers use GPS technology and are typically indicate only. The GPS antenna is typically mounted on the bowl of the scraper and allows the operator to compare the depth of the cut versus the site plan. This takes a lot of the ambiguity out of moving large amounts of material.\n\nGPS technology is applied in both trash compactors and soil compactors. Typical systems record where the compactor has been in order to create a map of the area's compaction. Usually the display has various colors that indicate that the machine has compacted the area.\n\nGPS systems typically have a high initial cost of around $100,000 per machine. When used properly GPS on average can increase productivity by as much as 30% over traditional methods. There is also cost reduction of material (since less is needed) because such high accuracy can be achieved. Some construction projects even require the use of GPS since it can bring down the overall cost of the project due to its efficiency advantages. Some GPS systems allow the user to switch systems to other machines making this tool very versatile. The contractor must plan for greater efficiency, since increasing one aspect of the job by 30% may not increase the overall efficiency, since another area may not be able to keep up. \"If you do everything right and boost overall productivity say 30 percent, you’re going to have to line up 30 percent more work in the future or send crews home early\".\n\nGPS is extremely versatile in the earthmoving industry but it does have its limitations. GPS satellite signals can only be received in a non obstructed view of the sky with the exception of clouds. If a contractor wanted to perform grade work in preparation for a concrete floor within a building for example, the roof would block the view to the GPS satellites preventing the system from working. Working too close to a structure can also obstruct the machine's view of the sky creating dead zones. High-voltage power-lines can also create dead zones when working underneath them. GPS satellite coverage can also be weaker during certain parts of the day lowering the amount of satellites the machine's system can use. This all depends on the geographical location and time of day. Improvements in GPS technology and the addition of GLONASS (Russian GNSS Satellites) satellites have reduced this issue. As mentioned earlier, in order to increase the overall accuracy of GPS you have to purchase and use a base station which adds additional cost.\n\nGPS continues to be integrated in the construction industry and soon will be an industry standard. Autonomous cars that utilize GPS are currently being developed and someday the earthmoving industry could incorporate such features. Already new machines are coming equipped with GPS integrated from the factory. The possibilities are endless and who knows what other practical uses for GPS in the earthmoving industries will be discovered.\n\n2010 saw the advent of the first user-oriented web resource for prospective 3D machine control users. The Kellogg Report publicized a detailed comparison of the major systems available on the market, evaluating more than 200 system features. The report continues to be updated as the technology evolves.\n"}

Its objective \"is to develop concepts, definitions and recommendations for the use of quantities and their units for ionizing radiation and its interaction with matter, in particular with respect to the biological effects induced by radiation\".\n\nThe ICRU is a sister organisation to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). In general terms the ICRU defines the units, and the ICRP recommends how they are used for radiation protection.\n\nDuring the first two decades of its existence, its formal meetings were held during the International Congress of Radiology, but from 1950 onwards, when its mandate was extended, it has met annually. \n\nUntil 1953, the president of the ICRU was a national of the country that was hosting the ICR, but in that year it was decided to elect a permanent commission - the first permanent chairman being Lauriston S. Taylor who had been a member of the commission since 1928 and secretary since 1934. Taylor served until 1969 and on his retirement was accorded the position of honorary chairman which we held until his death in 2004, aged 102.\n\nIn the late 1950s the ICRU was invited by the CGPM to join other scientific bodies to work with the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) in the development of a system of units that could be used consistently over many disciplines. This body, initially known as the \"Commission for the System of Units\" (renamed in 1964 as the \"Consultative Committee for Units\") was responsible overseeing the development of the International System of Units (SI).\n\nIn the late 1950s the ICRU started publishing reports on an irregular basis - on average two to three a year. In 2001 the publication cycle was regularised and reports are now published bi-annually under the banner \"Journal of the ICRU\".\n\nThe commission has a maximum of fifteen members who serve for four years and who, since 1950, have been nominated by the incumbent commissioners. Members are selected for their scientific ability and is widely regarded as the foremost\npanel of experts in radiation medicine and in the other fields of ICRU endeavor. The commission is funded by the sale of reports, by grants from the European Commission, the US National Cancer Institute and the International Atomic Energy Agency and indirectly by organisations and companies who provide meeting venues. Commissioners, many of whom have full-time university or research centre appointments, have their expenses reimbursed, but otherwise they receive no remuneration from the ICRU. \n\nThe commission has been responsible for defining and introducing many of the following units of measure. The number of different units for various quantities is indicative of changes of thinking in world metrology, especially the movement from cgs to SI units.\n\nThe following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units.\nAlthough the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the use of the units curie, rad, and rem alongside SI units, the European Union European units of measurement directives required that their use for \"public health ... purposes\" be phased out by 31 December 1985.\n\nThe Commission's secretariat is in Stockholm and its legal status is that of British charity (Not-for-profit organisation).\n\n"}

In response to the demand for quality television in Arabic, myTV secured exclusive deals with the most popular channels such as LBC America and Rotana.\n\nmyTV launched its services through an online campaign themed \"Messages from Home\" that began on January 30, 2012. The videos, composed of genuine messages gathered from Lebanese people across the country to their relatives abroad, were posted on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Pinterest; these social platforms made up the bulk of online tools used during the campaign.\n\nIn March 2013, Communicate Levant, the Beirut-based sibling of market-leading Communicate magazine, one of the region’s leading advertising, marketing and media resource, voted myTV as the number one startup for 2013.\n\nChannels currently available on myTV include\n\n\nmyTV has an extensive Video on Demand library, consisting of Arabic movies, Arabic TV series, documentaries, cartoons and short films consisting of popular titles, such as the following:\n\nAs of 2013, myTV has become available on over 300 devices, which consist of set-top boxes, smart TVs and tablets.\nSome of the devices include:\n\n\nInternet Television\n\nOTT\n"}

{"id": "23695653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23695653", "title": "Rusanda", "text": "Rusanda\n\nRusanda is the name of a Lake Rusanda (Jezero Rusanda), a highly saline, shallow wetland, and also a spa town of Rusanda (Banja Rusanda), in Melenci, Zrenjanin, Serbia. Belgrade is to the south. The spa was founded in 1867.\n\nDue to the high salinity of both the water and the mud, up to 60%, it has been speculated that Rusanda is one of the remnants of the ancient Pannonian Sea, but the lake is probably a fossil bed of the Tisza river. Records show that healing mud from the lake's bottom, peloid, has been used for therapeutic treatments at least since the 1760s. Mud therapy proved to be quite beneficial with muscle inflammation, rheumatism, gout and especially with the car crash injuries.\n\nIn August 2017 a complete drying out of the lake gained media attention. It was reported of the ecological catastrophe which endangered the local population, agriculture (vineyards, orchards) and 200 bird species living in the lake area, due to the toxic saline dusts blown by the winds. Also, the mud dries and can't be used, while the Sun damages both the peloid's quality and quantity.\n\nThe hydrologists however said that drying of the lake is not unusual, it happens occasionally (like in the mid-2000s) without disrupting the ecosystem, but it didn't gain as much media attention previously. When the rainy season starts, the lake will fill up again. It happens due to the dry summers and possibly because of the disturbance of the level of underground waters, caused with the construction of the Danube–Tisa–Danube Canal. In order to prevent this, hydrological research was conducted in the early 2010s, and the plan was made to dig several water wells which would prevent the lake from drying up during the periods of drought. The wells were built but apparently are not functioning yet. Still, the experts warned that the irrigation of the lake may disturb the natural balance and influence the medicinal properties of the mud so that best thing would be to let the nature regulate the lake, as it is.\n\nPeloid indeed can't be used when it dries and hardens, but the spa, organized as the Special hospital for rehabilitation \"Rusanda\", always has stored quantities of it, in cases the complete drying up happens. To change the properties of the mud, the drought would have to last much longer, at least a 1,000 years, and one dry season is not nearly enough. The layers of mud are actually sediments of sand clay. The chemical composition: dominant are silicon dioxide, aluminium oxide and iron oxide, with other oxides, microelements and a significant amount of total sulfur. The lake was declared a Nature park \"Rusanda\".\n\n"}

Their main business is making products for use in Australia such as set top boxes (STBs) and personal video recorders (PVRs) to be used with satellite television or digital television. Strong Australia in recent times have been manufacturing Android media players and IPTV products to expand their lineup.\n\nThe company has a head office in Melbourne, Australia, and its parent company Strong Technologies bases its operations in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nStrong Australia produces PVRs for standard- and high-definition television program recording. The PVRs store the digital files in a container-format with the .TS file extension on their hard-disk drives or on external drives via USB; software updates are provided on their website which include fixes and improvements on both previous and current models.\n\nSince 2012, Strong Australia have been introducing Android-based media players to the Australian retail market in the form of set top boxes. Beginning with the SRT AN4, this was the first media player available in the Australian market with an Android based operating system running Ice Cream Sandwich which also included a DVB-T2 terrestrial tuner for the viewing of live television. The SRT AN4M model is the same without including the DVB-T2 tuner. Both units use a Telechips TCC892x CPU with 1GB of RAM, two USB 2.0 ports, a coaxial audio out port for digital audio output and one HDMI output.\n\nRock-Box is the name of Strong Australia's more recent Android media player series, with two different models including the SRT RB2 and SRT RB4. Both models run Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and use Rockchip RK3066 and RK3188 processors, a selection of dual and quad core chips relating to the names of the Rock-Box model numbers (SRT RB2 - Dual core, SRT RB-4 - Quad core).\n\nThe key differences between the SRT RB2 and SRT RB4 along with their chipset differences are as follows:\n\n\nBoth models use the same Mali-400 GPU although the GPU inside the SRT RB4 is clocked slightly higher as a result of the quad core processor. 2.4GHz Wi-Fi with external antenna, Bluetooth, MicroSD card reader and four USB 2.0 ports make it a suitable media player for different applications and will accept common external hard drives with formats including but not limited to FAT 32 and NTFS as well as USB mice or keyboards, both wired and wireless.\n\nThese products come with the stock Android applications installed as well as the Netflix, Hulu and XBMC applications. There is no skin or aesthetic changes on the version of Android in place on the Rock-Box products so it is a pure image of Android with minor tweaks for the set top box format.\n\nA complete list of models is available on the Strong Australia website\n\n"}
