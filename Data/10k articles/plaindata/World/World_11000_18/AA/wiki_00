It was unfinished upon the death of the younger Le Vau in 1676. Malon de Bercy's son and heir, Charles-Henri II de Malon de Bercy (1678–1742), superintendent of finances, finished its construction, but modified the plans, filling in the moats, creating gardens, and altering the interior distribution. The château was reworked from 1702 to 1713 by the architect Jacques de La Guépière, who added to the service buildings. Charles-Henri II commissioned sculptors employed on royal buildings to modernize the château's furnishings in 1713-14.\n\nThe gardens, designed by André Le Nôtre, extended to the banks of the Seine river. They were also known as the \"Parc de Bercy\". The whole Bercy area around the château and the river were full of gardens and other houses and mansions. These gradually gave way to more condensed housing as the city grew in population during the 19th century.\n\nThe château was sold and demolished in 1861. Today the main SNCF route from east to west, the Périphérique and the autoroute de l'Est run where the garden of Le Nôtre used to be. Only two hunting pavilions survive, built 1713–1714 to the designs of Jacques de La Guépière and located on either side of the rue du Petit Château.\n\nOne of the console tables became a part of the collections of the Louvre Museum.\n\n\n"}

This initiative, originally convened in 2009 by four Harvard-based institutions including the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, comprises a network of more than thirty leaders in the fields of cancer and global health from around the world. GTF.CCC also draws on more than 50 technical and strategic advisors, a private sector engagement group, a strategic advisory committee, and a dual secretariat of staff based at the Harvard Global Equity Initiative and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.\n\nThe mandate of the GTF.CCC is to design, implement and evaluate innovative strategies for expanding access to cancer prevention, detection and care. The initiative focuses on the creation of global facilities and strategies for the financing and procurement of affordable, essential cancer drugs, vaccines and services for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship and palliation. Through local partners, the GTF.CCC supports implementation of innovative service delivery models that provide evidence for scaling up access to cancer care and control, and strengthening health systems in developing countries.\n\nAlthough once considered a problem exclusive to high-income countries, cancer is a leading cause of death and disability in the developing world. Of the 7 million cancer deaths in the world today, approximately 70% occur in developing countries. By 2030, low and middle income countries will bear the brunt of an estimated 27 million new cancer cases and 17 million cancer deaths.\n\nCase fatality for the cancers that can be treated or prevented is much higher in the developing world – a result of grave inequity in the opportunity to survive the disease. In the case of breast cancer, the ratio of deaths to incident cases in 2002 was an estimated 56% in low-income countries, 44% in low-middle income countries and 39% in high-middle income developing countries. In the developed world, it was 24%.\n\nThe world faces a huge and largely unperceived cost of inaction from cancer in the developing world, which calls for an immediate and large-scale global response.\n\nThe Task Force is a 36-member body combining leaders in cancer and global health and co-chaired by Julio Frenk, Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health and Lawrence Corey, President and Director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Her Royal Highness Princess Dina Mired of Jordan and Lance Armstrong serve as Honorary Co-Presidents. The Harvard Global Equity Initiative, under the direction of Felicia Knaul and Julie Gralow, serves as the Secretariat for the Task Force.\n\nThe GTF.CCC was launched on November 4, 2009 at Harvard University during the International Conference ‘Breast Cancer in the Developing World: Meeting the Unforeseen Challenge to Women, Health and Equity.’\n\nA key contribution of the Task Force is the GTF.CCC Report published in 2011. The content of the GTF.CCC Report follows from the mandate of the Task Force and provides the building blocks of a strategy for expanded cancer care and control strategies in the developing world.\n\nThe report includes the below content:\n\n• A list of priority cancers in the developing world,\n\n• the definition of an essential package of services and drugs,\n\n• estimates of potential demand for drugs,\n\n• designs and strategies for service delivery models that harness the primary and secondary levels of health care systems and expand access while reducing cost,\n\n• mechanisms for regional and global negotiation of drug prices, and\n\n• options for scaling-up service delivery and monitoring health outcomes.\n\nFollowing the dictum of thinking globally and acting locally, the GTF.CCC reviews and builds on the lessons learned from work in specific countries, as well as dedicating itself to expanding cancer care and control in these countries. Innovative and successful models have been identified constituting three models and spanning five countries of differing levels of income (Rwanda, Malawi, Haiti, Mexico and Jordan). These models will serve as dynamic learning laboratories for generating and applying the specific proposals and delivery models that are designed by the GTF.CCC and detailed in the report introduced above. The pilot programs will specifically focus on developing, designing, implementing and evaluating innovations in delivery in the areas of task shifting, infrastructure shifting and the use of technology.\n\nThe GTF.CCC partner projects were chosen based on the opportunity to expand access to cancer care and control, as well as the ongoing involvement of members of the GTF.CCC and/or the Secretariat. Thus, this aspect of the work of the GTF.CCC does not involve establishing new projects, but rather working to improve, extend, expand and scale-up initiatives and institutions that are already well-established. The partner programs listed below are locally entrenched and independently sustainable.\n\nFor 2010, the local partners and programs are:\n\n• Rwanda, Malawi, Haiti: Partners in Health working with Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\n• Mexico: the National Commission of Social Protection for Health, the Ministries of Health of the States of Morelos, Jalisco and Nuevo León, the National Institute of Public Health of Mexico, the National Cancer Institute of Mexico, the Mexican Health Foundation, and the program Cáncer de mama: Tómatelo a pecho.\n\n• Jordan: King Hussein Cancer Foundation and Center, and the Jordan Breast Cancer Program\n\nCancer control opportunities in low- and middle-income countries.

The ship was built by Cook, Welton & Gemmell in Beverley, England. She was laid down on 13 June 1942, launched on 26 September 1942 and finally commissioned on 10 February 1943. Her role was to support convoys, and deter attack by German u-boats using depth charges. This class of vessel could be fitted with extra guns, and the Grenadier was reported to have had an extra pair of Oerlikon 20mm guns and a Type 290 mast mounted radar.\n\nHer most notable engagement occurred on 16 March 1945. That morning she was in convoy alongside the steam merchant \"Inger Toft\", now operating under the Ministry of War transport, when at 0900 \"Inger Toft\" was struck by a torpedo fired from German submarine \"U-722\" and began to quickly sink. The skipper of \"Grenadier\" at the time was A/SkrLt Arthur George Day of the Royal Navy Reserve. It was common practice when under attack, for the skipper to order the crew to take the vessel to full propulsion whilst dropping depth charges, to avoid being hit whilst trying to hunt the culprit U-boat. A/SkrLt Day realised that the men of \"Inger Toft\" whose vessel had now fallen beneath the water would have little chance of survival if they followed this routine. He ordered his men to turn the vessel into the direction of the sunken vessel. Whilst ultimately risking his vessel and entire crew, they managed to save the entire 30 man crew of \"Inger Toft\" including the master from the freezing waters. For his actions A/SkrLt Arthur George Day was mentioned in dispatches, he received an oak leaf to be worn on his 1939-1945 war medal. Following the war he returned to his pre-war occupation as a skipper operating from the small fishing port of Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire Wales.\n\nOnce the war ended \"Grenadier\" was first sold to a merchant fishing firm in Grimsby, she was renamed \"Thurinigia\", later in 1947 she was converted for oil burning but by 1966 she was sold for scrap.\n\n"}

Located on the river Tigris, south of where the Diyala River branches off and upstream of Maškan-šapir, it formed a small city-state in an area where the edges of the territories controlled by Larsa, Babylon and Elam converged. Inscribed in cuneiform as ma-al-gi-im, its chief deities were Ea and Damkina.\n\nThree of its rulers have been identified with certainty, through attestation in their inscriptions as šàr (lugal) ma-al-gi-im, Takil-ilissu, son of Ištaran-asû, Imgur-Sin, son of Ili-abi, and, probably the last one, Ipiq-Ištar, son of Apil-Ilišu, a contemporary of Ḫammu-rāpi of Babylon, who celebrated conflict with the city in two of his year names (10 and 35). A further three rulers have been proposed, Šu-Kakka, Nabi-Enlil and Šu-Amurrum, three generations of a dynasty, based upon Šu-Kakka’s year name honoring the goddess Damkina. Their absolute position is uncertain but they seem to have reigned from the immediate aftermath of the downfall of the Ur III empire.\n\nThe kings of Larsa targeted Malgium in their pursuit of territorial expansion with Gungunum celebrating its conquest in his 19th year name, circa 1914 BC, Sin-Iddinam its defeat in his 5th year name ca. 1844 and Warad-Sîn commemorated mu ugnim mà-al-gu-um tukul ba(-an)-sìg, “Year : the army of Malgium was smitten by weapons”, ca. 1831 BC. Ḫammu-rāpi, in a grand coalition with Shamshi-Adad I and Ibal-pi-El II (of Eshnunna), campaigned against the city-state until its ruler bought them off with 15 talents of silver. Freed from its vassalage to Elam, by Ḫammu-rāpi’s triumph over them, Malgium’s king, Ipiq-Ištar, concluded a treaty and subsequently provided aid and soldiers in Ḫammu-rāpi’s campaign against Larsa. For as yet uncertain reasons, Ḫammu-rāpi turned on his erstwhile ally and sacked the city ca. 1758, deporting much of its populace to Babylonia. Its state in the Middle Babylonian Period and later periods was much more humble as an administrative district called Malgu and a settlement referred to as Maliki.\n"}

{"id": "32707439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32707439", "title": "Polish–Czechoslovak confederation", "text": "Polish–Czechoslovak confederation\n\nThe Polish-Czechoslovak confederation, or federation, was a political concept from the time of World War II, supported by the Polish government-in-exile and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom and the United States. It was a revitalisation of the Międzymorze concept, proposing the creation of a federation based on Poland and Czechoslovakia. The project had less support in the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, which believed it did not need Polish support against the Soviet Union, and was eventually sunk by the growing Soviet dominance, as Joseph Stalin did not want a strong and independent federation in Europe that could threaten his designs for Eastern Europe.\n\nSoon after the Polish defeat in the Polish September Campaign, both the Polish and Czechoslovak governments (Czechoslovakia having been reduced to a German puppet state following the Munich Agreement) formed in exile in the West. However, despite a common enemy, Czechoslovakia–Poland relations were less than friendly because of Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts. The Polish government aimed to revitalize the Międzymorze federation concept and to create a strong federation of states in Central and Eastern Europe, revolving around Poland and Czechoslovakia, as a barrier to further German and Soviet aggression. The Czechoslovak government, initially split between two groups (those of Milan Hodža and Beneš), was tentatively supportive of the idea, at least publicly.\n\nCzechoslovak politicians Hodža and Jan Masaryk both wanted a confederation, Beneš was more lukewarm; his goal was to ensure that the disputed Zaolzie territory that had passed to Poland in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement was regained by Czechoslovakia, and that became one of the major issues of contention in the ongoing negotiations. Beneš, who saw regaining the territory as a primary objective, saw the Soviet Union, particularly in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Poland, as a potential ally and as a counterbalance to Poland, and he would steadily align his government more with the Soviet Union than Poland in the belief that an alliance with a powerful country would be more beneficial to Czechoslovakia than a federation with several other smaller powers. That was quite contrary to the Polish attitude, as the Polish leader of that time, Władysław Sikorski, saw the Soviet Union as a major threat to the postwar European order.\n\nThus, when Sikorski approached Beneš and proposed discussions over a future Polish-Czechoslovak federation in 1939, aiming to create a stronger postwar Poland and Czechoslovakia, Beneš's response was lukewarm at best, as he was not interested in strengthening Poland. He was content to see Czechoslovakia re-established within its pre-1938 borders.\n\nNonetheless, Beneš did not refuse Sikorski's proposal outright, as the federation proposal was supported by the UK and later by the US, which also supported the plans for other federations such as the Greek-Yugoslav confederation. He was afraid that open refusal would lead to the Poles opening negotiations with the Czechoslovak opposition or to his government being marginalized by the British Foreign Office. Beneš decided to continue the negotiations with the Poles over the possibility of federation but with little haste; in fact, many of the Czechoslovak government's moves were designed to prolong the negotiations without any real commitment. The negotiations proceeded slowly, with numerous conferences, and with joint declarations on 11 November 1940 (a declaration by the two governments about entering \"a closer political and economic association\"), on 23 January 1942 (in which both governments agreed to form a confederation after the war and mentioned common policies on diplomacy, defense, trade, education and communication) and on 10 June 1942. January 1941 saw the establishment of the Czechoslovak-Polish Coordinating Committee to oversee the process of the negotiations.\n\nSome early proposals focused on economic co-operation, unified foreign policy, a customs union and a common currency but separate government offices. A Polish proposal from 1941 called for the co-ordination of foreign and economic policies, including total economic unification. Beneš tried to frame the potential federation as no more than a tool for mutual defense against Germany and argued that the Soviet Union was not a threat but a potential ally. The Czechoslovak position was so pro-Soviet that the Beneš government passed secret documents from the Czech-Polish negotiations to the Soviets and assured them that they were acting in the best interests of Czechoslovakia-Soviet Union relations.\n\nThe Soviets saw the Polish-led federation of Central and Eastern European states as a threat to their planned sphere of influence. They put further pressure on the Czechoslovak government, with promises of alliance and territorial guarantees. By late 1942 and early 1943, as the Soviet Union's position was boosted by its military victories, Czechoslovak-Soviet cooperation became much stronger; on 12 November 1942, the Czechoslovak side suspended talks with the Poles until permission from the Soviet Union had been obtained, and on 10 February 1943, the Czechoslovak diplomat Hubert Ripka informed the Polish government that no agreement that could be seen as antagonistic towards the Soviet Union would be supported by the Czechoslovak government. That was a major blow to the Polish-Czechoslovakian negotiations.\n\nSoon afterward, Poland and the Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations over the Katyń massacre. Beneš, meanwhile, focused on pursuing a Czechoslovakia-Soviet alliance. The death of Sikorski that year was another major blow to the planned federation, as he was seen as the plan's major supporter in the international scene. In December 1943, a new Treaty of Alliance (for 20 years) was signed between the Czechoslovak government in exile and the Soviet Union in Moscow, and a Treaty of Military Co-operation between the two followed next spring.\n\nBeneš's support for the Soviet Union went so far that during his 1943 visit to the US, he argued that the Soviet Union would never be a threat to either Czechoslovakia or Poland. Beneš probably saw the threat of identity loss for Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak people in such a federation as more likely than the threat of a conflict or takeover by the Soviet Union, which he perceived as a benevolent ally. In the end, the Polish federation plan came to naught; instead, the short-term victory with regard to the Central and Eastern European geopolitical scene went to Beneš, and in the long term, it went to his Soviet allies.\n\nCzechoslovakia would regain most of the disputed Zaolzie territory, but by 1948, both it and Poland would have only nominal independence, as they would fall to communist takeovers and become part of the Soviet sphere of influence. Beneš died in 1948, soon after the communists took power in the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 and forced him to retire from politics.\n\na As the details of the planned union were never finalized, it is not clear whether it would have been a federation or a confederation. Sources use both the term \"Polish-Czechoslovakian federation\" and the term \"Polish-Czechoslovakian confederation\".\n\n"}
