The tombs are not identical, with some having ramps while others have stairs. The walls of the dromos have been cut in such a way that they are closer to each other at the top than they are at the bottom, probably to help bear the weight of the earth above. The entrances were originally covered by a large stone, which is usually still next to the entrance. Several of the larger tombs have a pillar in the center of the chamber. One tomb's walls are lined with stone benches cut directly from the rock. \n\nArtifacts from the chamber tombs include seal stones, jewelry, bronze tools, stone vases, bronze vessels and pottery. Clay larnakes, a type of small coffin, painted with double axes, hunting scenes, and Horns of Consecration were also excavated.

This satellite was to be part of the Ekspress series of geostationary communications satellites owned by Russian State Company for Satellite Communications. The satellite was de-orbited on 28 March 2012 into the Pacific Ocean, in spite of efforts of it being used for Antarctic broadband purposes.\n\nAlthough there have been several satellites de-orbited over the years, Ekspress AM4 would have been able to provide broadband services to the Antarctic for the first time.\n\nThe Ekspress AM4 satellite was launched on 18 August 2011 on a Russian Proton rocket from Kazakhstan, which included a Briz-M stage. It was just after launch that the Briz-M stage did not separate from the Ekspress satellite, causing it to fall into the wrong orbit.\n\nThe total mass of the Ekspress AM4 satellite was 5,800 kg, and the spacecraft had 64 transponders. The onboard antennas were capable of broadcasting in the C, K, L, and Ka bands. The satellite's orbit was measured at 1,007 by 20,317 km altitude, with an inclination orbit of 51.3 degrees. Though the satellite was placed in the wrong orbit, there was no damage to the satellite, meaning that it became the subject of numerous reuse proposals.\n\nOne of the most notable reuse proposals came from a company called Polar Broadband Systems, which was established in December 2011. Its objectives were to submit proposals for the reuse of semi-retired and retired satellites for use with communications over the Antarctic. The company notes that it would not have been feasible to build a dedicated satellite for the region as the population would not justify the expense, however Ekspress AM4 would suffice as it could have been maneuvered into the required orbit. There was enough fuel on board for it to be operational for ten years, with giving the Antarctic region 16 hours of broadband access a day.\n\nDennis Pivnyuk, chief financial officer of the Russian Satellite Communications Co, informed on 15 March 2012 that the satellite would be decommissioned and deorbited. He stated that the descent phase would start on 20 March, with the spacecraft reentering over the Pacific Ocean around 26 March. The spacecraft was destroyed during reentry on 28 March.\n\n"}

Military logistical systems, however, continued to rely on 19th century technology.\n\nThe main method of transportation of supplies at the start of the war was still by horse due to the lack of available alternatives in 1914, similar to that of the inclusion of cavalry within the armed forces, and the fast pace of the war in the first part of the war. When World War I started, the capabilities of rail and horse-drawn supply were stretched to their limits. As the war progressed it became increasingly difficult to supply soldiers in the traditional way by horse and carriage due to conditions at the front. The supply routes became muddy and impassable, improvement to artillery on both sides and other tactics meant that supplies became increasingly delivered under cover of night and were considerably slowed down.\n\nHowever, as the war ground down into static trench warfare it became easier for armies to support their troops with the use of the railway, especially for the artillery. This made the transportation of supplies easier and quicker to get from the factories to the front line. This did have problems of their own, as seen by the Shell Crisis of 1915. Where the stalemate of trench warfare took hold, special narrow gauge trench railways were built to extend the rail network to the front lines. The great size of the German Army proved too much for its railways to support except while immobile. Tactical successes like Operation Michael devolved into operational failures where logistics failed to keep up with the army's advance over shell-torn ground. \n\nOn the seas, the British blockade of Germany kept a stranglehold on raw materials, goods, and food needed to support Germany's war efforts, and is considered one of the key elements in the eventual Allied victory in the war. On the Allied Side a huge producer of supplies was the United States of America, meaning the supplies had to be transported over the Atlantic Ocean to England and France. At the same time, Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare showed the vulnerability of shipping lanes despite Allied naval superiority. This revolutionised how war shipping was conducted and saw the first use of military convoys to counter the threat caused by German U-Boats.\n\nIn June 1918 the Allies organized the Military Board of Allied Supply, which proved to be an invaluable mechanism for coordinating logistical requirements for armies working in close proximity during the final battles that autumn. The Board’s report contains overviews of the logistical systems for the principal Allied armies.\n\nThe trans-Atlantic distances and the American inexperience at large scale operations combined to make support of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) extraordinarily difficult. Mass production of munitions, including cargo ships, did not reach full potential until near the end of the war. In the meantime, the United States relied upon European allies for most weapons and upon Britain for shipping. In France, the Americans built or improved ports, railroads, depots, and other facilities to move the supplies to the front. Slowly the Americans learned the multiple functions associated with supporting a large-scale conflict, which allowed the AEF to operate as a independent force. Experience gained in World War I proved invaluable during later conflicts.\n\n\n"}

His professional career began as a Virgin Megastore DJ. He had previously presented student radio at Brunel University's radio station, Radio Brunel.\n\nIn early 1987, he joined Radio Luxembourg to present an overnight music show. After hearing American talk show presenter Neil Rogers Abbot was inspired and the show instead became a phone in. Eventually, a 'straight to air' format was settled upon, where calls would be taken unscreened. This format quickly became a hit with listeners. The absence of a delay system to 'dump' offensive language resulted in callers saying swear words just before they were cut off. It is believed that Abbot was one of the first (if not the first) to take calls straight to air, and later LBC colleague Iain Lee has often confessed that he stole some of his act from Nick (as well as Clive Bull and Tommy Boyd), perhaps hinting he got the inspiration for his \"Triple M\" show from Nick Abbot in addition to Boyd's \"Human Zoo\" show.\n\nIn October 1988, Abbot launched the new BBC radio station for London, BBC GLR (Greater London Radio). He presented the breakfast show for a year, but his contract was not renewed. He then returned to VMR, where he stayed until 1993.\n\nAbbot was part of the original line-up on Virgin Radio in April 1993. There he presented the weekday late night phone-in show SundayThursday from 10pm to 2am. The programme was a mixture of music and phone-in. Not afraid to speak his mind, he often voiced his opinions about other stations and presenters, and it was this that eventually led him into trouble.\n\nFollowing a negative newspaper review by writer Robin Katz, Abbot's outbursts on-air eventually led to a censure from the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the Radio Authority. He also called phone-in shows on other radio stations, speaking to the phone operators, and commenting on the usually elderly callers while listening to the programmes while on hold. Usually, he failed to make it on air, but occasionally he did, including a memorable call to the Scottie McClue show. In June 1994 he was moved to the weekday 710pm show where he had to tone down his act, mainly taking music requests.\n\nIn January 1995, he moved back to the weekday late night show (this time from 11pm to 2am) where he remained until April that year when he was moved to the drivetime show (47pm). He was dismissed from the station in September that year, leaving Virgin Radio with a fine of £5,000 for a sexual reference about a fellow DJ, and a further £20,000 for allowing a caller graphically to describe a sexual practice.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Abbot was heard on Talk Radio UK acting as holiday cover. He was subsequently offered a regular show during the summer of 1997 on Saturday afternoons, alongside Carol McGiffin, later moving to Saturday evenings from 7:30pm to 10 pm.\n\nThursday 12 November 1998 was known as \"Black Thursday\". Talk Radio UK had been taken over by new management, and many presenters and staff were fired. Abbot was one of the many casualties. He continued with his weekday show on Virgin Radio, which was now extended to six days a week from 1pm to 4 pm SundaysFridays.\n\nIt was during this period that Virgin Radio's new management re-hired Abbot to cover various shows on the station. He took over the evening show for six weeks during the summer of 1997, as well as providing holiday cover. In early 1998, he took over the weekday afternoon show on Virgin Radio from 1pm to 4 pm, while continuing with his Saturday evening show on Talk Radio. In May 1998 (while still presenting his daily show on Virgin Radio) he took over the weekday evening show on Talk Radio UK from 7pm to 9 pm.\n\nBetween March and September 1999, long-established London station LBC hired Abbot & McGiffin for a Saturday evening phone-in, similar in format to the duo's earlier Talk Radio show. During this time, he continued working for Virgin Radio as a DJ. Throughout the summer of 2000, he presented a Sunday morning phone-in show on Virgin, also hosting the weekday afternoon show. Later that year he moved to the drivetime slot, until leaving Virgin once again, in May 2001. He also provided holiday cover for Chris Evans.\n\nIn late 1999, Abbot joined Real Radio (Wales) to host its late-night phone-in show for a week as holiday cover for regular presenter Adrian Allen. October 2001 saw the beginning of a five-day stint at Manchester's Key 103, during which he presented the 10pm2am programme.\n\nIn January 2002, he moved to Real Radio (Scotland) where he again presented the late night phone-in. Later in 2002, his show was networked across all three Real Radio stations (Scotland, Wales & Yorkshire).\n\nHe presented his last Real Radio show on 19 December 2002, subsequently deciding to take a break from radio for over two years.\n\nOn 3 September 2005 Abbot was heard on London's 102.2 Smooth FM, presenting the Saturday morning show. He stood in for various presenters, including on 'Weekend Breakfast', and covered shows on digital station Planet Rock. This became a regular gig from 17 December 2005 onwards, airing on Saturdays and Sundays from 2–6 pm.\n\nIn 2006, he had brief stint standing in on Caroline Feraday's weekend show (10 pm1 am, Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights) on LBC 97.3, from 10–19 February. However, he lost his voice during his second show, cutting the show short and being replaced by a recording of his friend and former Virgin and Talk colleague/sparring partner Wendy Lloyd. He was also unable to present the following evening's show but returned on 17 February for the final three shows of this stint. He subsequently took over a regular slot on LBC on Saturday nights from 10pm to 1am.\n\nAbbot's show had a distinctive style among LBC presenters. It became normal for a summary of the week's news to take place at the start of the show over his opening jingle, \"Boogie Woogie\" by Liberace (replacing the theme tune he had previously used: \"The Beautiful People\" by Marilyn Manson). During the show, he played various sound clips including quotes from films such as The Terminator, and clips from his former co-presenter Carol McGiffin.\n\nIn late 2007, he took over LBC's weekday evening show from 7pm to 10pm, while continuing with the Planet Rock weekend show (the latter ending in September 2008).\n\nAbbot now presents a Friday and Saturday night show on LBC from 10pm to 1am. Featuring commentary and discussion on current affairs and other subjects the show has a strong emphasis on humour. His links and commentaries are punctuated by short dialogue clips drawn from film soundtracks and politicians. Calls to the programme are often on serious topics, and callers are given free rein. Abbot also usually presents a week of A to Z themed shows on LBC during the festive period, covers for other LBC presenters on an occasional basis and writes a blog for the LBC website. In March 2017 he launched a new podcast entitled \"The Nick Abbot Habit\" with a second series started in September 2018.\n\nAbbot has written a series of books, mainly on topics and news from the time of publishing, including \"Listen to me, I Know Everything\" and \"Do You Mind If I Say A Few Words\", which chart his columns through a specific time period.\n\n\n"}

The approximate meaning is \"Cultural jewel\".\n\nThe band was established in late 1971. The Minister of Culture of that time, famous novelist Ch. Lodoidamba called four young musicians and said: \"England has a band the Beatles of four young men. Why shouldn't we have a similar band?\" The four young musicians, who had recently graduated from the School of Music and Dance in Ulaanbaatar (nowadays College of Music and Dance) as yatga (ятга) players, established a rock band. The members were Tserenbat (drums), Erdenekhuyag (guitar), Batsaikhan (guitar) and Naranbaatar (keyboard). Later members were Galsanbat (guitar-solo), Zundari (bass), Bayar (vocal), Damdinsuren (guitar), Jargalsaikhan (drums), Jargalsaikhan (guitar/vocal), B. Tsolmon (drums). Among more recent members were D. Enkhbold (guitar-solo) and Kh. Bulgan (keyboard). Soyol Erdene also performed female singers Rentsenkhand, Nandintsetseg, Dulamsuren, Uranchimeg, Nasantogtokh and Ariunaa.\n\nDuring socialism the band worked under the administration of the State Philharmony which also supervised a symphony orchestra and the jazz band Bayan Mongol.\n\nThe first compositions of the band were Mongolian folk songs in a rock style arrangement as well as songs written by the members of the band. They often used poems of famous Mongolian writers.\n\nThe rock band was frequently criticised by the MPRP censorship for promotion of the Western musical style and Western fashion.\n\nSoyol Erdene won the gold medal at the 10th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1973.\n\nAmong the most popular songs created by the members of Soyol Erdene during its merseybeat period in the early 1970s were \"Setgeliin jigüür\" (\"The wings of the Mood\") by Zundari, \"Zürhnii aizam\" (\"Melody of the Heart\"), \"Uchraliin uyanga\" (\"Melody of Love\") by Galsanbat, Ankhnii khairiin duu (\"Song of the First Love\") and Hüleelt (\"Waiting\") by Jargalsaikhan.\n\nThe most popular rock interpretations of Mongolian folk songs were \"Damdin\" and \"Tonjoo\" (Western Mongolian folk song). Western Mongolian folklore fitted well to the rock arrangement.\n\nThe most renowned instrumental compositions of Soyol Erdene were \"Soyol Erdene\", \"Sansriin khölög\" (\"Spaceship\"), Tsenkher zalaa (a yatga solo that became a jingle for weather forecasts) and \"Ankhnii tsas\" (\"The First Snow\") by Naranbaatar.\n\nMusic of Mongolia\n\n"}

Its capital was Bamako.\n\nFrom early on Upper Senegal and Niger was wracked by violence in the face of colonial reorganization and taxation. Most notable were the Kobkitanda rebellion, led by the blind cleric Alfa Saibou, and the Karma revolt (December 1905–March 1906) of Oumarou Karma. The latter engulfed much of the Niger valley and was suppressed by four French columns arriving from Dori, Gao, Tahoua, and Zinder.\n\nA decree of 2 March 1907 added the \"cercles\" of Fada N'gourma and Say, which had been part of the colony of French Dahomey (present day Benin). On 1 January 1912, the military territory of Niger was split off from Upper Senegal and Niger, and was erected into a colony in 1922.\n\nBetween November 1915 and February 1917, the Colony of Upper Senegal and Niger witnessed vastly popular, temporarily successful, and sustained armed opposition to colonial government in its western Volta region, which is referred to as the Volta-Bani War. It challenged colonial government authority for more than a year in an area stretching from Koudougou (in present-day Burkina Faso) in the east, to the banks of the Bani River (present day Mali) in the west. This was the most significant armed opposition to colonial authority organized anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa in the period preceding World War II. \n\nAfter World War I ended, the unsuspected success of this resistance movement caused the French authorities to issue the decree \"Concerning the Division of the Colony of Upper Senegal and Niger and the Creation of the Colony of Upper Volta\" of 1 March 1919, which divided the colony into two distinct units:\n\nThe colony of Upper Senegal and Niger is perhaps remembered most often by philatelists, since it issued a number of postage stamps during its existence.\n\n"}

She was the first female fighter pilot to serve in the French Air Force, and held eight world records for distance, altitude and speed.\n\nBoselli was born in Paris on 11 March 1914. She studied at École des Sciences Politiques in Paris and graduated in 1935. While a student, she was involved in various humanitarian organizations, including the Red Cross. She became interested in aviation after attending an aviation conference with her brother. Initially she volunteered at air fields, working in hangars and on engines, until in January 1938 she obtained her private pilot's license. She purchased her own aircraft, a Leopoldoff, began training in aerobatics, and decided to earn her public pilot's license. However, World War II broke out and all civilian training was cancelled; Boselli's flight log from that period ends on 4 August 1939.\n\nIn 1944, a corps of female military pilots was formed and Boselli joined, with the rank of second lieutenant. She was trained in aerobatics and became a trainer herself. On February 12, 1946 she received her military pilot's license, becoming the first woman in France to do so. As the war had ended, however, female pilots were not needed and she was offered an administrative position instead. Boselli declined, and chose to return to civilian aviation. In May 1947 she began training as a glider pilot under Paul Lepanse at Beynes, obtaining her licence four months later. Boselli immediately began to enter competitions, setting a number of records. In 1951, Boselli visited the United States of America and met a pair of seaplane pilots who offered her the opportunity to fly a seaplane; she completed her training in 10 days and successfully achieved a seaplane pilot licence.\n\nBoselli returned to the military in 1952, joining a presentation squadron of aerobatic pilots based at Étampes called Patrouille de France. Boselli and the squadron performed in Monaco, Algeria and Spain, with Boselli as one of the solo performers. In 1957, she was offered an assignment in Algeria, which she accepted. She was based at Oued Hamimine, and flew military evacuations, transport missions and delivered supplies and mail to troops.\n\nBy the age of 45, she had accumulated 900 flight hours and 335 missions, and ceased flying. She spent the remainder of her career as an attaché-editor in the air navigation service until her retirement in 1969.\n\nIn her retirement, Boselli was president of the history committee of the Aero Club of France, and wrote her memoirs. Boselli died in Lyon on 25 November 2005 and is buried in Guillotière Cemetery.\n\n\nFor her services to her country, she received the Legion of Honor, the Cross for Military Valour and the Aeronautical Medal. There is a street in Lyon named after Boselli. In 2013, a housing estate was built on a former airfield in Angers, and was named the Boselli neighbourhood.\n"}
