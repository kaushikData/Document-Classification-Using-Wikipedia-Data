It is the oldest, continuously operating faith-based news journal in Ghana, and one of the oldest newspapers in the country. It was set up on the Gold Coast in 1883 by the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society. The first issue was published in Basel on 1 March 1883 under the editorship of the German missionary and philologist, Johann Gottlieb Christaller who had then retired from the mission. \n\nChristaller noted that many German Basel missionaries were not proficient in the English language and urged prospective writers to make use of English scholars for further review and proofreading before final submission to him, the editor, as he was not a native English speaker. A few months before, in a letter to the editor from Christiansborg dated 13 October 1882, the first Basel missionary-trader Hermann Ludwig Rottman inferred that \"t\"he primary aim of the journal was to encourage people who were not proficient in English to write in Twi or Ga\"\" A similar news publication, t\"he Christian Messenger and Examiner\" had earlier been founded in 1859 by Wesleyan missionaries, Thomas Birch Freeman and Henry Wharton as a medium to translate foreign literature and classical works into native African languages.\n\nOriginally, the medium of publication was English, Ga and Twi. The newspaper temporarily changed its name to the \"Christian Reporter\" and published solely in Twi while the \"Christian Messenger\" was printed in Ga. Subscription climbed to a readership of 600 but sharply decreased over time. After Christaller's death in 1895, the printing of the newspaper ceased. Production started again in 1905 at then newly established Basel Mission Printing Office in Akropong.\n\nThe newspaper has opinion pieces, news bulletins, advertisements, banns of marriage and obituaries and funeral announcements of notable individuals associated with the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. The newspaper also publishes feature articles on topical issues like \"Fruit of the Spirit\", etc. and publishes authoritative information on the various groups in the Church such as the Women's Fellowship, the Young People's Guild (YPG) and the Young Adult Fellowship (YAF).\n\nThe administration of the church appoints an editor-in-chief for a tenure of about four years. General oversight and management of the newspaper is carried out by an Editorial Board. The Basel Missionaries originally established the newspaper as a way “\"to inform, educate, evangelize and entertain its readers... to the north, east, west and south\"” corners of the Church. The Basel Mission under the United Trading Company (UTC) aimed to win over converts to Christianity through its readership, in addition to provision of Christian activities, general news, entertainment, travel journals as well as relevant political events and on the Gold Coast. This was in line with the original aim of the newspaper which was \"to encourage African scholars to write in Twi and Ga.\" The newspaper also informs readers about the developments within the church, its structure and hierarchy, Presbyterian terminologies as well as the work of the Presbyteries, Districts, Congregations. Today, the newspaper also covers socioeconomic, political trends, military history and contemporary changes in global society.\n\n"}

{"id": "5644032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5644032", "title": "ECEF", "text": "ECEF\n\nECEF (acronym for \"earth-centered, earth-fixed\"), also known as ECR (initialism for \"earth-centered rotational\"), is a geographic and Cartesian coordinate system and is sometimes known as a \"conventional terrestrial\" system. It represents positions as X, Y, and Z coordinates. The point (0, 0, 0) is defined as the center of mass of Earth, hence the term geocentric coordinates. \n\nIts axes are aligned with the international reference pole (IRP) and international reference meridian (IRM) that are fixed with respect to Earth's surface, hence the descriptor \"earth-fixed\". This term can cause confusion, since Earth does not rotate about the z-axis (unlike an inertial system such as ECI), and is therefore alternatively called ECR.\n\nThe z-axis extends through true north, which does not coincide with the instantaneous Earth rotational axis. The slight \"wobbling\" of the rotational axis is known as polar motion. The x-axis intersects the sphere of the earth at 0° latitude (the equator) and 0° longitude (prime meridian in Greenwich). This means that ECEF rotates with the earth, and therefore coordinates of a point fixed on the surface of the earth do not change. Conversion from a WGS84 datum to ECEF can be used as an intermediate step in converting velocities to the north east down coordinate system.\n\nConversions between ECEF and geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) are discussed at geographic coordinate conversion.\n\nGeocentric coordinates can be used for locating astronomical objects in the Solar System in three dimensions along the Cartesian X, Y, and Z axes. They are differentiated from topocentric coordinates, which use the observer's location as the reference point for bearings in altitude and azimuth. However, neither system takes Earth's constant motion into account, which requires the addition of a time component to fix objects.\n\nFor nearby stars, astronomers use heliocentric coordinates, with the center of the Sun as the origin. The plane of reference can be aligned with the Earth's celestial equator, the ecliptic, or the Milky Way's galactic equator. These 3D celestial coordinate systems add actual distance as the Z axis to the equatorial, ecliptic, and galactic coordinate systems used in spherical astronomy.\n\nThe distances involved are so great compared to the relative velocities of the stars, that for most purposes, the time component can be neglected.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5021160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5021160", "title": "Ecological collapse", "text": "Ecological collapse\n\nEcological collapse refers to a situation where an ecosystem suffers a drastic, possibly permanent, reduction in carrying capacity for all organisms, often resulting in mass extinction. Usually, an ecological collapse is precipitated by a disastrous event occurring on a short time scale. Ecological collapse can be considered as a consequence of ecosystem collapse on the biotic elements that depended on the original ecosystem.\n\nEcosystems have the ability to rebound from a disruptive agent. The difference between collapse or a gentle rebound is determined by two factors—the toxicity of the introduced element and the resiliency of the original ecosystem.\n\nThrough natural selection the planet's species have continuously adapted to change through variation in their biological composition and distribution. Mathematically it can be demonstrated that greater numbers of different biological factors tend to dampen fluctuations in each of the individual factors.\n\nScientists can predict tipping points for ecological collapse. The most frequently used model for predicting food web collapse is called R50, which is a reliable measurement model for food web robustness.\n\nAlthough, there is no single cause for ecological collapse, attributing factors include asteroid impacts, extremely large volcanic eruptions, and abrupt climate change. The snowball effect of these attributing factors and ecological collapse are demonstrated within the fossil record. Prehistoric examples include the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, the Permian–Triassic extinction event, and other mass extinctions. For example, effects of climate change as a contributing factor towards ecological collapse are demonstrated in the Ordovician–Silurian extinction events. A possible cause of the Ordovician Extinction was global cooling which affected the habitats of marine life. Consequently, sea creatures such as trilobites, brachiopods, and graptolites became extinct. Furthermore, Karabonov and colleagues conducted a study to show how during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), alternations in the environment and climate led to ecological collapse in Lake Baikal and Lake Hovsgol which then led to species evolution in these systems. The collapse of Hovsgol's ecosystem during the LGM brought forth a new ecosystem, with limited biodiversity in species and low levels of endemism, in Hovsgol during the Holocene. Karabonov's study also shows that ecological collapse during LGM in Lake Hovsgol led to higher levels of diversity and higher levels of endemism as a byproduct of evolution following the ecological collapse of the LGM. The Ordovician Extinction event and Lake Baikal and Hovsgol demonstrate two effects of ecological collapse on prehistoric environments.\n\nHistoric examples include the collapse of the Grand Banks cod in the early 1990s, attributed to overfishing.\n\nImportant pressures contributing to current and future ecological collapse include habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, overgrazing, overexploitation of ecosystems by humans, human industrial growth and overpopulation, climate change,ocean acidification, pollution, and invasive species.\n\nRainforest collapse refers to the actual past and theoretical future ecological collapse of rainforests. It may involve habitat fragmentation to the point where little rainforest biome is left, and rainforest species only survive in isolated refugia. Habitat fragmentation can be caused by roads. When humans start to cut down the trees for logging, secondary roads are created that will go unused after its primary use. Once abandoned, the plants of the rainforest will find it difficult to grow back in that area. Forest fragmentation also opens the path for illegal hunting. Species have a hard time finding a new place to settle in these fragments causing ecological collapse. This leads to extinction of many animals in the rainforest.\n\nIn the Carboniferous period, coal forests, great tropical wetlands, extended over much of Euramerica (Europe and America). This land supported towering lycopsids which fragmented and collapsed abruptly. The collapse of the rainforests during the Carboniferous has been attributed to multiple causes, including climate change. Specifically, at this time climate became cooler and drier, conditions that are not favourable to the growth of rainforests and much of the biodiversity within them. This sudden collapse affected several large groups including lycopsids and amphibians. Reptiles prospered in the new environment due to adaptations that let them thrive in drier conditions.\n\nA classic pattern of forest fragmentation is occurring in many rainforests including those of the Amazon, specifically a 'fishbone' pattern formed by the development of roads into the forest. This is of great concern, not only because of the loss of a biome with many untapped resources and wholesale death of living organisms, but also because plant and animal species extinction is known to correlate with habitat fragmentation.\n\nOvergrazing was found to cause land degradation, specifically in Southern Europe, which is another driver of ecological collapse and natural landscape loss. Proper management of pastoral landscapes can mitigate risk of desertification.\n\nIn 2010 roughly 170 million gallons of oil was dumped into the Gulf of Mexico when BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded. The effects of the BP oil spill are still being felt today, more than 8,000 marine birds, sea turtles and marine mammals were found dead or injured within months of the clean up effort. The impact of this disaster has unbalanced the food web of the environment. The oil spill occurred at the height of breeding season and as result affected egg and larval animals to the worst extent wiping entire age classes. This loss of a generation down the line will prove dire for future predators of the ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, a major concern for marine biologists is the effects of ecological collapse on the coral reefs (who based on fossil evidence are more vulnerable to extinction but also demonstrate greater resilience). An effect of global climate change is the rising sea levels which can lead to reef drowing or coral bleaching. Human activity, such as fishing, mining, deforestation, etc., serves as a threat for coral reefs by affecting the niche of the coral reefs. For example, Edinger and colleagues demonstrate a correlation between a loss in diversity of coral reefs by 30-60% and human activity such as sewage and/or industrial pollution.\n\nThe ocean is in great danger of collapse. In a study of 154 different marine fish species, David Byler found out that many factors such as overfishing, climate change, and fast growth of fish populations will cause ecosystem collapse. When humans fish, they usually will fish the populations of the higher trophic levels such as salmon and tuna. The depletion of these trophic levels allow the lower trophic level to overpopulate, or populate very rapidly. For example, when the population of catfish is depleting due to overfishing, plankton will then overpopulate because their natural predator is being killed off. This causes an issue called eutrophication. Since the population all consumes oxygen the dissolved oxygen(DO) levels will plummet. The DO levels dropping will cause all the species in that area to have to leave, or they will suffocate. This along with climate change, and ocean acidification can cause the collapse of an ecosystem.\n\nAlthough global climate change and human dominance are inevitable, humans can institute greater self-awareness in order to aid the habits of creatures such as coral reefs.\n\nSome scientists predict that a global ecological collapse will occur after 50% of the natural landscape is gone due to human development.\n\nAlthough the causes of ecological collapse are due to factors unique to their environment, they all for the most part share similar ramifications such as loss in biodiversity, trophic cascades, and even extinction. For example, the urbanization and deforestation of the South east Asian Pacific has led to the extinction of three plant species and eight animal species in 2003.\n\n"}

Founded in 1974, SEE connects over 650 volunteer ophthalmologists and medical professionals to host clinic sites worldwide. Its objective is to provide sight-restoring surgeries in communities that are overwhelmed with the large number of blind individuals who cannot afford surgery. The organization is headed by President/CEO Randal Avolio, along with a 16-member Board of Directors. In the United States, it is classified by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity. It is a GuideStar Platinum Participant.\n\nSEE's mission statement is, \"To provide medical, surgical and educational services by volunteer ophthalmic surgeons with the primary objective of restoring eyesight to disadvantaged blind individuals worldwide.\"\n\nSEE International coordinates short-term medical expeditions all over the world at the request of ophthalmologists in host countries where access to vision care is scarce. SEE International’s volunteer ophthalmologists work closely with the host eye surgeons to perform safe and quality sight-restoring surgeries.\n\nIn 2015 alone, SEE International performed over 15,000 surgeries in 39 countries around the world. Over the course of 40 years SEE has screened approximately 3.8 million individuals, and completed over 460,000 surgeries in over 80 different countries.\n\nSEE expeditions typically take place over the course of one week. All teams are invited by the local health authority from the host country. SEE’s international clinic coordinators work with the host ophthalmologists three to six months in advance to coordinate logistical details and to ensure the availability of proper facility, equipment, supplies, support and staff.\n\nSEE’s primary focus of cataract surgery is one of the most cost-effective of all health interventions. Cataracts cause nearly half of the world’s loss of sight, and are surgically correctable. Except for the most developed countries, cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness in all regions of the world. With a 30-minute surgery and the patient under local anesthetic, a volunteer SEE surgeon can restore the sight of a person who has been blind with cataracts for 5, 10 or even 20 years.\n\nCataract surgeries in developing countries require a technique that is not normally practiced in the United States. Because of the density of the cataracts and the lack of infrastructure for sophisticated equipment, a manual process must be utilized in many developing countries. While ophthalmologists have traditionally employed the extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) manual method, this technique requires a relatively large incision made in the cornea which requires sutures. With the newer MSICS procedure, a much smaller incision is made that is also self-sealing. Skilled surgeons can perform twice as many surgeries in the same amount of time with the MSICS procedure compared to ECCE. In addition, patients typically have better post-op visual acuity, less astigmatism, fewer incidences of infection and heal faster through this process.\n\nAs part of SEE International’s ongoing commitment to patient care and affiliate ophthalmologists, and because of all the benefits of Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery, SEE International has begun to train ophthalmologists in the technique through a one-day course held one to two times a year at the SEE offices in Santa Barbara.\n\nSEE International established the Santa Barbara Vision Care Program (SBVCP) in the 1980s, in response to the population within SEE’s own local community that could not afford vision care. The SBVCP saves eyesight in patients through early detection and to provide sight-restoring surgery to those in need. In 2015, the SBVCP provided services for 1,424 low-income and uninsured patients in Santa Barbara County.\n\nIn the December 10, 2001 issue of Forbes, SEE International was cited in the Charity Investment Guide for its 99% efficiency as a charity, meaning that financially almost nothing is lost to overhead.\n\nOn June 22, 2015, the United Nations General Assembly announced that SEE affiliate Dr. Helena Ndume was selected to receive the first-ever United Nations Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Prize. According to General Assembly President Sam Kutesa:\nThe prize recognizes the achievements of those who dedicate their lives to the service of humanity by promoting UN purposes and principles while honouring Nelson Mandela’s extraordinary life and legacy of reconciliation, political transition and social transformation.\n\nIn 2016, the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) recognized SEE volunteer Dr. Janak M. Shah, M.D., as an Eye Health Hero. Dr. Shah has collaborated with SEE on over 140 ophthalmic expeditions worldwide, the most out of any SEE surgeon to date. The purpose of the Eye Health Heroes program is \"to celebrate eye care practitioners and front line staff whose everyday efforts behind the scenes are making a real difference towards Universal Eye Health.\" Dr. Shah and other Eye Health Heroes will be recognized at the 10th General Assembly of the IAPB, in Durban, South Africa, October 27–30, 2016.\n\nCorporate and foundation partners support SEE through in-kind medical donations and cash grants.\n\n"}
