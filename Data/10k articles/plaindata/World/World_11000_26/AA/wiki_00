They intended to take Jews captive in a Prague synagogue, make demands which could not be met and then blow up the building, killing everybody inside. Interior Minister Ivan Langer said the situation was \"the most serious ever\".\n\nAccording to Czech Chief Rabbi Efraim Sidon, the attack had been planned against the Jerusalem Synagogue in the center of the city, and not against a synagogue in the Jewish Quarter. The Czech security services were investigating a possible link between fresh terror threats made by radical Muslims to kill Jews in Prague and the arrest of a Pakistani citizen in Oslo.\n\nNo information has been released and it is unknown if any arrests had been made. \n"}

In the 16th century, a coat consisting of the Archangel Michael clad in white robes, holding a sword and a shield on a red field was adopted for the Kiev Voivodeship. \n\nIn 1487, along with Magdeburg rights, the city of Kiev received a coat of arms consisting of a hand holding a crossbow.\n\nIn 1782, a new coat of arms was approved by the order of Catherine II of Russia. In the order the coat of arms is described as \"Archangel Michael in a short tunic on an azure field\". Later on it was decorated with an imperial crown and other ornaments. No original image of the arms has been recovered to date. Some modern drawings of the arms exist, based on the description in Catherine's order.\n\nIn 1918, during the short time of Ukrainian independence, a coat of arms was adopted which contained, in addition to the Archangel Michael and the crossbow, a trident from the Coat of arms of Ukraine, emphasizing the city's role as the nation's capital.\n\nIn 1957, a coat of arms was introduced with chestnut leaves and a bow on the red-azure field, containing the word КИЇВ (\"KYIV\"; Ukrainian for 'KIEV'), and such Soviet symbols as the hammer and sickle and the Hero City medal.

About 5,000 lower middle-class \"natives,\" male Genevans born to long-standing Geneva families, lived in the city but were excluded from voting or serving in office. These men worked as artisans and craftsmen in various trades, principally watchmakers. Also excluded from the franchise were an even larger number of \"habitants,\" residents whose roots lay in the canton but outside the city, or whose families had immigrated to Geneva from elsewhere. \n\nAgitation for a broader franchise had been ongoing for years; on 5 February 1781, unenfranchised men, \"habitants,\" and \"natives,\" broke into the municipal armory and armed themselves. In response, the General Council of Geneva, the largest of the city's legislative bodies, voted to grant voting rights to 100 \"natives\" and 20 \"habitants.\" However, the more elite legislative body, the Genevan Small Council, baulked at ratifying this token offer of enfranchisement, stalling for over a year before, in April 1782, voting to block the enfranchisement. Within hours of the vote, revolutionists occupied the City Hall, closed the city gates, held the \"no voters (called \"Negatives\") hostage, and convinced the Representatives of the General Council to support them.\n\nThe city's wealthy burghers countered by persuading the Kingdom of France, the city-state of Bern, and the Kingdom of Sardinia to send professional troops. The leaders of the aborted Revolution fled by ship across Lake Geneva. The city was returned to government by the burgher elite.\n\nNotes\n"}

For the election of 1994 Marijnissen was the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) and won two seats in the House of Representatives, the first time the Socialist Party won representation in the States General of the Netherlands. Marijnissen was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives on 17 May 1994 and became the Parliamentary leader of the Socialist Party in the House of Representatives. For the elections of 1998 and 2002 Marijnissen again as Lijsttrekker won three and four seats respectively. For the election of 2006 Marijnissen for the fifth time as Lijsttrekker won sixteen seats and the Socialist Party became the third-largest party House of Representatives. On 20 June 2008 Marijnissen announced his retirement as Leader of the Socialist Party and Parliamentary leader of the Socialist Party in the House of Representatives citing health reasons. Marijnissen remained a Member of the House of Representatives until after the 2010 general election. Marijnissen stood down as Chairman of the Socialist Party on 28 November 2015.\n\nHe is the father of Lilian Marijnissen, the current Leader of the Socialist Party. \n\nJohannes Guillaume Christianus Andreas Marijnissen was born on 8 October 1952 in Oss in the Dutch Province of North Brabant in a Roman Catholic family. After leaving secondary school shortly before the exams, he worked in a number of factories in and around Oss. He then trained as a welder, working for ten years in the metal industry.\n\nMeanwhile, he helped founding the SP in Oss and, in 1975, became the Netherlands' youngest councillor ever. He remained a councillor until 1993, playing a leading role in many campaigns, such as against polluting discharges. The SP's council representation in Oss has grown at every local election and is, as of 2005, the biggest stronghold of the Socialist Party in the Netherlands. Nicknamed \"The Wizard of Oss\", after his hometown, he became famous when he turned out to be one of the main architects of the Dutch vote that rejected the European Constitution in June 2005.\n\nIn 1987 Marijnissen became the party's first ever provincial assembly member, in North Brabant. A year later he became the SP's national president. Under his leadership the party was transformed from \"a federation of local branches\" into a party with a clear national programme, nationally-organised activities and a national profile.\n\nBeginning in 1994, when the SP made the breakthrough which brought it into the House of Representatives, Marijnissen was chairman of the party's parliamentary group. After gaining two out of the 150 parliamentary seats during this first breakthrough, support for him and his party rose slowly but continuously. After four years in parliament, his Socialist Party went under his lead from two to five seats during the national elections of 1998, which was followed by a growth towards nine seats in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, after the 87-day term of Balkenende I, the Socialist Party didn't manage to gain more seats than the year before and stayed at the same level with again 9 out of 150 seats. Although there was a slight rise in number of people who voted for the SP compared to a year before, a few weeks before the elections the polls suggested the SP might double.\n\nAfter the 2004 elections a conflict arose between Jan Marijnissen and Ali Lazrak, when the latter refused to conform to an agreement that required all SP politicians to donate part of their wages. Lazrak accused Marijnissen of dictatorial behavior; an attempt to settle the argument failed and Lazrak left the fraction on 2 February 2004.\n\nIn February 2006 the party was polled on 9.5% of the electorate in the municipal elections. After the untimely end of Balkenende II and the minority government of Balkenende III, the SP won 16 more seats in the 2006 elections to a total of 25, becoming the third party of the Netherlands. Soon after, the party membership passed 50,000.\n\nIn 2006 a majority of members of parliament voted for his idea to build a National Historic Museum in the Netherlands. In 2007 the Minister of Culture decided the city Arnhem would be its residence.\n\nOn 17 June 2008 Marijnissen announced his resignation as chairman of the SP group in the House of Representatives because of health reasons. However, he remains a member of the House of Representatives and chairman of the Socialist Party.\n\nMarijnissen was said to appeal to the 'common man' because of his use of simple language. His appeal is also explained by some observers by his capacity of presenting himself as a valid, more social alternative to the PvdA, which moved into a more centrist third way direction by advocating welfare reforms under the leadership of Prime Minister Wim Kok and his so-called Purple Cabinets (1994–2002).\n\nCritics of Marijnissen call his leadership style authoritarian, because he is presumed to have a tight grip on his party.\n\n\n\n"}

Based on an idea by Friedrich Wilhelm von Raison, it was established in Mitau, capital of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, by Duke Peter von Biron in 1775. The duke wanted to attract professors like Immanuel Kant and Johan Gottfried Herder, but they refused.\n\nAfter the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Jelgava became part of the Russian Empire and the gymnasium unsuccessfully petitioned to become a university. Nevertheless, it became an important cultural hub not only for Latvians, but also Lithuanians. Many famous professors had lectured in Academia Petrina for example Johann Benjamin Koppe (1775), Johann August von Starck (1777-1781) and Wilhelm Gottlieb Friedrich Beitler (1775-1811).\n\nDuring World War I, the school was evacuated to Taganrog in Rostov Oblast while its 42,000-volume library was burned by troops of Pavel Bermondt-Avalov. During World War II, the historical school building was almost completely destroyed, therefore school was reestablished in new premises. The original building was later restored and now functions as the Ģederts Eliass Jelgava History and Art Museum.\n\n\nThe establishment of the academy was based on an idea by Friedrich Wilhelm von Raison: \"\"But the whole province owes him excellent thanks for the effective part, which he took at the foundation of the Mitauian Gymnasium. He was actually the one who persuaded Duke Peter to do so; it was he who corresponded with Sulzern regarding the plan to be drawn up and because of the appointment of the first teachers and he who prescribed the books for the library and the instruments for the observatory; just as he also continuously participated in the perfection of the institute until his death\".\" \n\nThe intention was to establish a complete university with all four faculties in Mitau. This plan was rejected because of Kurland's dependence on Catholic-Polish rule. Under the law of Poland a university could not be founded without the consent and confirmation of the Pope, and it was unclear whether and when the permission by the papal curia to establish a Protestant theological faculty could have been obtained. Therefore, this intention was abandoned and it was decided to found an academic gymnasium which - half school, half university - should enjoy all the rights of a university, with the exception of the privilege of granting academic dignity. \n\n"}

It has been referred to as the \"Impossible Black Tulip of Cartography\", \"because of its rarity, importance and exoticism\". The map was crucial in expanding Chinese knowledge of the world. It was eventually exported to Korea then Japan and was influential there as well, though less so than Alenio's \"Zhifang Waiji\".\n\nThe 1602 Ricci map is a very large, high and wide, woodcut using a pseudocylindrical map projection showing China at the center of the known world. The 1906 Eckert IV map resembles the display of this Chinese map. It is the first map in Chinese to show the Americas. The map's mirror image originally was carved on six large blocks of wood and then printed in brownish ink on six mulberry paper panels, similar to the making of a folding screen.\n\nIt portrays both North and South America and the Pacific Ocean with reasonable accuracy. China appropriately is linked to Asia, India, and the Middle East. Europe, the Mediterranean, and Africa also are well delineated. Diane Neimann, a trustee of the James Ford Bell Trust, notes that: \"There is some distortion, but what's on the map is the result of commerce, trade and exploration, so one has a good sense of what was known then.\"\n\nTi Bin Zhang, first secretary for cultural affairs at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in 2009: \"The map represents the momentous first meeting of East and West\" and was the \"catalyst for commerce.\"\n\nThe map includes images and annotations describing different regions of the world. Africa is noted to have the world's highest mountain and longest river. The brief description of North America mentions \"humped oxen\" or bison (駝峰牛 \"tuófēngníu\"), feral horses (野馬, \"yěmǎ\"), and names Canada (加拿大, \"Jiānádà\"). The map identifies Florida as \"Huādì\" (花地), the \"Land of Flowers.\" Several Central and South American places are named, including Guatemala (哇的麻剌, \"Wādemálá\"), Yucatan (宇革堂, \"Yǔgétáng\"), and Chile (智里, \"Zhīlǐ\").\n\nThe map's cartographer, Matteo Ricci, gave a brief description of the discovery of the Americas. \"In olden days, nobody had ever known that there were such places as North and South America or Magellanica (using a name that early mapmakers gave to a supposed continent including Australia, Antarctica, and Tierra del Fuego), but a hundred years ago, Europeans came sailing in their ships to parts of the sea coast, and so discovered them.\"\n\nThe Museo della Specola Bologna has in its collection, displayed on the wall of the Globe Room, original copies of panels 1 and 6 of the six panels comprising the 1602 Ricci map. During restoration and mounting, a central panel—a part of the Doppio Emisfero delle Stelle by the German mathematician and astronomer Johann Adam Schall von Bell—was inserted between the two sections by mistake.\n\nIn 1958, Pasquale D’Elia, sinologist at the University of Rome certified the authenticity of the Chinese maps in this museum’s possession, (see op. cit.) stating that \"it is the third edition of a geographical and cartographical work that made Ricci famous throughout China. He had already made a first edition in 1584 at Shiuhing, followed by a second in 1600 at Nanking, and two years later a third in Peking.\n\nIn 1938, an exhaustive work by Pasquale d'Elia, edited by the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, was published with comments, notes, and translation of the whole map. The maps carry plentiful instructions for use and detailed illustrations of the instruments that went into their production, as well as explanations regarding conceptions of \"systems of the terrestrial and celestial world\". There is a long preface by Matteo Ricci in the middle of the map, where it depicts the Pacific Ocean. D’Elia’s translation reads:\n\nThe figure of the \"Nove Cieli\" (Nine Skies) is printed to the left of the title, illustrated as per sixteenth-century conceptions. The accompanying inscription explains the movement of the planets. The right-hand section (panel 6) has other inscriptions giving general ideas on geography and oceanography. Another inscription records an extract of the Storia dei Mongoli regarding the motions of the Sun.\nIn the top of the left-hand section (panel 1), there is an explanation of eclipses and the method for measuring the Earth and the Moon. Both sections carry the characteristic Jesuit seal, the IHS of the Society of Jesus. At the bottom left, in the Southern Hemisphere, is the name of the Chinese publisher of the map and the date: \"one day of the first month of autumn in the year 1602\".\n\nThe map also incorporates an explanation of parallels and meridians, a proof that the sun is larger than the moon, a table showing the distances of planets from the earth, an explanation of the varying lengths of days and nights, and polar projections of the earth that are unusually consistent with its main map.\n\nMatteo Ricci (1552–1610) was a Jesuit priest. Ricci was one of the first Western scholars to live in China and he became a master of Chinese script and the Classical Chinese language. In 1583, Ricci was among the first Jesuits to enter China from Macao. The first Chinese world map was named \"Yudi Shanhai Quantu\" (輿地山海全圖) and made in Zhaoqing in 1584 by Matteo Ricci with Chinese collaborators. Ricci had a small Italian wall map in his possession and created Chinese versions of it at the request of the governor of Zhaoqing at the time, Wang Pan, who wanted the document to serve as a resource for explorers and scholars.\n\nOn January 24, 1601, Ricci was the first Jesuit - and one of the first Westerners - to enter the Ming capital Beijing, bringing atlases of Europe and the West that were unknown to his hosts. The Chinese had maps of the East that were equally unfamiliar to Western scholars.\n\nIn 1602, at the request of the Wanli Emperor, Ricci collaborated with Mandarin Zhong Wentao, a technical translator, Li Zhizao, and other Chinese scholars in Beijing to create what was his third and largest world map, the \"Kunyu Wanguo Quantu\".\n\nIn this map, European geographic knowledge, new to the Chinese, was combined with Chinese information unknown to Europeans to create the first map known to combine Chinese and European cartography. Among other things, this map revealed the existence of America to the Chinese. Ford W. Bell said: \"This was a great collaboration between East and West. It really is a very clear example of how trade was a driving force behind the spread of civilization.\"\n\nAccording to John D. Day, Matteo Ricci prepared four editions of Chinese world maps during his mission in China before 1603:\n\nSeveral prints of the Kunyu Wanguo Quantu were made in 1602. Most of the original maps now are lost. Only six original copies of the map are known to exist, and only two are in good condition. Known copies are in the Vatican Apostolic Library Collection I and at the James Ford Bell Library at the University of Minnesota. The Vatican's 1602 copy was reproduced by Pasquale d’Elia in the beautifully arranged book, \"Il mappamondo cinese del P Matteo Ricci, S.I.\" in 1938. This modern work also contains Italian translations of the colophons on the map, a catalogue of all toponyms, plus detailed notes regarding their identification.\n\nOther copies of the 1602 map are located at: Japan, Kyoto University Collection; collection of Japan Miyagi Prefecture Library; Collection of the Library of the Japanese Cabinet; and a private collection in Paris, France. No original examples of the map are known to exist in China, where Ricci was revered and buried.\n\nThe maps received widespread attention and circulation. The governor General of Guizhou reproduced a copy of the map in a book about Guizhou published in Guiyang in 1604. Ricci estimated that more than 1,000 copies of the 1602 edition were reprinted.\n\nVarious versions of the map were exported to Korea and later Japan. The first Korean copy was brought back from Beijing by visiting ambassadors in 1603. An unattributed and very detailed two page coloured edition of the map, known in Japanese as \"Konyo Bankoku Zenzu\", was made in Japan circa 1604. Within this Japanese export copy, Japanese Katakana is utilised for foreign location names throughout the Western world. \n\nThe \"Gonyeomangukjeondo\" (Hangul: 곤여만국전도) is a Korean hand-copied reproduction print by Painter Kim Jin-yeo in 1708, the 34th year of King Sukjong's rule of Joseon. It shows Kunyu Wanguo Quantu (Complete Map of the World) measuring 533×170 cm on mulberry paper. This map, representing the world in an ellipse, was brought to Korea in the 36th year of King Seonjo's rule (1710) by Lee Gwan-jeong and Gwon Hui, two envoys of Joseon to China. It is owned and displayed at Seoul National University Museum, San 56-1, Sillim-dong, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea and was designated National Treasure No.849 on August 9, 1985. The map shows five world continents and over 850 toponyms. It contains descriptions of ethnic groups and main products associated with each region. In the margins outside the ellipse, there are images of the northern and southern hemispheres, the Aristotelian geocentric world system, and the orbits of the sun and moon. It has an introduction by Choe Seok-jeong providing information on the constitution of the map and its production process. This reproduction map provides a clear testimony to the national interest in western maps in 17th-century Korea. It is a highly esthetic piece of work and one of the most beautiful maps produced during the Joseon period.\n\nThe James Ford Bell Trust announced in December 2009 that it had acquired one of two good copies of the 1602 Ricci map from the firm of Bernard J. Shapero, a noted dealer of rare books and maps in London, for US$1 million, the second most expensive map purchase in history. This copy had been held for years by a private collector in Japan.\n\nFord W. Bell, president of the American Association of Museums (now the American Alliance of Museums) and a trustee of the James Ford Bell Trust started by his grandfather, James Ford Bell, the founder of General Mills, said in an interview with a reporter from Minnesota Public Radio's \"All Things Considered\": \"These opportunities don't present themselves very often. This map was the only one on the market, and the only one likely to be on the market. So we had to take advantage of that opportunity.\"\n\nThe map was displayed for the first time in North America at the Library of Congress from January through April, 2010. It was scanned by the Library of Congress Geography and Map Division to create a permanent digital image that will be posted on the internet later in 2010 in the World Digital Library for scholars and students to study. The map was then exhibited briefly at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, before moving to its permanent home at the James Ford Bell Library at the University of Minnesota, where it will be on display beginning September 15, 2010.\n\nBefore his death at Peking in 1610, Matteo Ricci prepared four more world maps after the 1602 one:\n\nMost of these maps now are lost. Later copies of the 1602 edition of the \"Kunyu Wanguo Quantu\" may be found in China, Korea, London, and Vienna; one copy of the map recently was discovered in the store-rooms of the Shenyang Museum in China. A world search is currently in progress by Kendall Whaling Museum of Massachusetts. Hong Weilian, earlier established a list of twelve total Ricci maps, which differs considerably from Day’s findings.\n\nIn 1607 or 1609 the \"Shanhai Yudi Quantu\", is a Chinese map which was published in the geographical treatise Sancai Tuhui. The Shanhai Yudi Quantu was influenced highly by the work of Matteo Ricci. Matteo Ricci had several of his own maps entitled \"Shanhai Yudi Quantu\". The locations in the map have been identified and translated by Roderich Ptak in his work, \"The Sino-European Map (“Shanhai yudi quantu”), in the Encyclopedia Sancai tuhui\":\n\nAbout 1620 Giulio Aleni made the world map \"Wanguo Quantu\" (萬國全圖, lit. \"Complete map of all the countries\"), putting China at the center of the world map, following Ricci's format and contents, but in a much smaller size (49 cm x 24 cm). This map was included in some editions of Aleni's geographical work, \"Zhifang waiji\". (Descriptions of Foreign Land) His 1623 preface states that another Jesuit, Diego de Pantoja (1571–1618), on the command of the emperor, had translated a different European map, also following Ricci's model, but there is no other knowledge of that work.\n\nIn 1633, the Jesuit, Francesco Sambiasi (1582–1649), composed and annotated another world map, entitled \"Kunyu Quantu\" (Universal Map of the World), in Nanjing.\n\nIn 1674, Ferdinand Verbiest developed the \"Kunyu Quantu\", a similar map, but with various improvements. It consists of eight panels, each 179 cm x 54 cm, together displaying two hemispheres in Mercator projection. The two outer scrolls individually depict cartouches that contain several kinds of information on geography and meteorology. The making of Verbiest's \"Kunyu Quantu\" was intended to meet the interest of the Kangxi Emperor, as Verbiest's introductory dedication implies. There currently are at least fourteen or fifteen copies and editions of this map known in Europe, Japan, Taiwan, America, and Australia.\n\nChen, Hui-hung discussed the religious meaning of the world maps that were produced by Jesuit missionaries in China from the late sixteenth to the seventeenth centuries. These world maps serve as a visual proof to emphasize the greatness of the world and the minuscule nature of humans. Through these maps people \"can see\" the truth of God because of the visual ability granted via God's omnipotence. Jesuit cartography was not only a visual image of geographical configuration: it paved the way for the comprehension of what they expressed as the Creator's significance.\n\nIt was an embodiment of the Renaissance tradition of cartography as the graphical representation of the universe. This includes the idea of understanding nature through mathematical science as well as understanding Heaven by visualization and sensibility. In this Renaissance tradition, geography was associated with cosmology that was based upon Christian theology. These maps expressed Aristotle's sensibility toward comprehension of the universe, which formed the core of Catholic epistemology and natural philosophy. The religious implications of Jesuit cartography in China are part of how the Jesuits used their cartographic superiority strategically in their evangelization.\n\nRicci was a Jesuit priest whose mission was to convert the Chinese to Roman Catholicism. He thought that might be helped by demonstrating the superior understanding of the world that he believed grew out of Christian faith. The map’s text shows it as part of a diplomatic attempt by Ricci to affirm the greatness of his own religion and culture. Ricci declares that it offers testimony “to the supreme goodness, greatness and unity of Him who controls heaven and earth.”\n\n"}

Throughout these years the public radio has been gathering, recording, broadcasting and preserving the culture and history of Armenia. Public Radio of Armenia owns four orchestras and the largest and richest sound archive in Armenia. \"\nOn September 1, 1926, the first experimental radio programme (25 minutes duration) called “Voice of Yerevan” was transmitted in Armenia. The first test programmes were mainly folk music programmes regularly interrupted by local news, putting into operation the first radio station in Armenia. This created new wide-range perspectives for moving the amateur radio movement forward, radiofication and planned development of radio and wired broadcasting networks. The creation of radio station made it possible to use radio broadcasting as one of the most efficient mass media for informing and educating the population. That is why radio programs were expected to cover such topics, which would interest people of different specialties and meet their needs.\n\nOn June 15, 1927, Armenian Republican Radio started to broadcast its programmes on regular basis. In the early years only Yerevan and surrounding villages were included in the broadcasting radius. Due to efforts of a group of radio lovers radio service was provided in more than 25 villages in 1927, and in another 40 the following year.\n\nOn April 6, 1927, national print media published the first radio program consisting of news and concerts.\n\nUp till 1929 actors and journalists from newspaper editorials were being invited to conduct the radio programmes. And only in December 1929 the first radio hosts - Vergine Babayan and Suren Kananyan were invited to work at the Republican Radio of Armenia. \nAt the end of 1929 the Republican radio committee was formed. The committee had 12 employees and annually aired 2,160-hour programmes. In 1930s the audience was significantly expanded. New technical and creative capabilities were put in use.\n\nDuring the post-war period the Republican radio opened a number of new editorial departments, extended the radius of radio transmissions, in 1947 started to operate the second channel (music and information), created new programmes and projects, increased broadcasting hours, as well as expanded its audience. In 1947 the radio committee was reorganized into radio informative committee attached to the Council of Ministers of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nThe building of new radio transmitters was put into operation in 1957. In 1962 the whole territory of Armenia was provided with radio service. In 1965 an editorial compilation fund for recordings for author performances and radio records was formed. Radio Gold Fund contains more than 20,000 (150,000 hours) sound records, music performances, art and poetry programs and radio performances.\n\nThe invaluable collection of sound documents involves the well-known voices of Haykuhi Garagash, Vahram Papazyan, Hrachya Nersisyan, Babken Nersisyan, Hrachuhi Jinanyan, Khoren Abrahamyan, Metaqsya Simonyan, Edgar Elbakyan, Garush Khajakyan, Tamar Demuryan, Marat Halajyan, Sos Sargsyan, Vladimir Abajyan, Vera Hakobyan, Silva Yuzbashyan, Svetlana Khanumyan, Sargis Najaryan, Karen Vardanyan, etc.\n\nRadio Day is a celebration of the development of radio. It is marked on 7 May, the day in 1895 on which Alexander Popov successfully demonstrated his invention. Radio Day was first observed in the Soviet Union in 1945. It emphasizes the importance and role of radio in political, social and cultural life of the country.\n\nAt the 56th General Assembly of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), held on July 7–8, 2005 in Dubrovnik (Croatia), the Public Television and Radio Company of Armenia became a fully-fledged member of this professional association of national broadcasters. Since 2004 PTRC was an associated member of the EBU. Thus, the Public Radio of Armenia gained the right to rebroadcast programs and participate in the projects of EBU.\n\nIn 2007 “Arevik” junior ensemble of Public Radio of Armenia was selected to represent Armenia for the first time at Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Arevik came second for Armenia with the song Erazanq. \n\nIn 2013 Public Radio of Armenia launched a web portal, with the help of the EBU, that connects producers and audiences of radio programmes targeted at young people across Europe. The LyunSe International portal aggregates current affairs stories from youth radio programmes across Europe and encourages interaction through a set of specialised forums. The portal’s development was supported by the EBU Partnership Programme and developed in Yerevan and Geneva.\n\nOn August 8, 1947 the decision was made to create an editorial group, which would prepare radio programs for Armenians living abroad. The first programme of this department was transmitted on Short Wave on August 10, 1947. USSR People’s Artist Vahram Papazyan reported the joyous news of kicking off the permanent programmes for diaspora. From 1957, in addition to broadcasts to the Middle East and Near East, broadcasts to the Western European countries were launched. \n\nCurrently Public Radio of Armenia is the only mass media in Armenia, which provides programmes in 14 languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Russian, Georgian, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, Yazidi, Assyrian and Greek) www.armradio.info\n\n\"International Public Radio of Armenia\" () is the international broadcasting service, established in 1967 under the label \"Radio Yerevan\".

According to Chadian forces, the attack began when Janjaweed, Sudanese militiamen, aided by the Government of Sudan, crossed the border from Sudan into Chad and raided the town of Amdjereme. According to Chadian Minister of Communications Hourmadji Moussa Doumgor the Janjaweed stole \"700 camels, 1,000 cows and 1,500 sheep and other goods belonging to these peaceful citizens. This new janjawid attack constitutes a flagrant violation of the Tripoli Accord and the Sudanese government should be held responsible. This latest incursion by Sudanese government militia undermines efforts backed by the African Union and Libya to seek a lasting solution to the conflict between the two countries.\"\n\nIn the government report, the Chadian military exchanged gunfire with the rebels and chased them back into Sudan. They recovered and returned the livestock to the citizens of Amdjereme.\n\nThe Government of Chad has accused Sudan of supporting United Front for Democratic Change rebels in the past, such as the Battle of Borota and the first and Second Battle of Adré. Chadian President Idriss Déby is especially concerned over recent high-level defections from the Chadian military to Sudan. The attack was the second in the region in three days.\n\n"}

SABC 1 carried much of its programming over from the defunct CCV (Contemporary Community Values) channel, which was itself made up of the old TV2, TV3 and TV4 channels created in the 1980s. SABC 1 generates the widest audience in South Africa due to its programming diversity, airing SABC's longest running soap-opera, \"Generations\", \"Uzalo\" and \"Skeem Saam\". The slogan for the channel is \"Mzansi fo sho\".\nOn 1 January 1982, two services were introduced, TV2 broadcasting in Zulu and Xhosa and TV3 broadcasting in Sotho and Tswana, both targeted at a Black urban audience. The main channel, now called TV1, was divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, as before. In 1985, a new service called TV4 was introduced, carrying sports and entertainment programming, using the channel shared by TV2 and TV3, which stopped broadcasting at 9:30pm.\n\nIn 1992, TV2, TV3 and TV4 were combined into a new service called CCV (Contemporary Community Values). A third channel was introduced known as TSS, or TopSport Surplus, TopSport being the brand name for the SABC's sport coverage, but this was replaced by NNTV (National Network TV), an educational, non-commercial channel, in 1994. \nIn 1996, the SABC reorganised it's three TV channels with the aim of making them more representative of the various language groups. These new channels were called SABC 1, SABC 2 and SABC 3.\n\nSABC's head office and studio is based in Auckland Park, Johannesburg and they also have offices in Cape Town.\n\n\n"}

Directed by Oliver Stone and written by Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald, the film, based on the books \"The Snowden Files\" by Luke Harding and \"Time of the Octopus\" by Anatoly Kucherena, stars an ensemble cast that includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the title character, Edward Snowden, with Shailene Woodley, Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, Tom Wilkinson, Scott Eastwood, Logan Marshall-Green, Timothy Olyphant, Ben Schnetzer, LaKeith Lee Stanfield, Rhys Ifans and Nicolas Cage also starring. Filming began on February 16, 2015 in Munich, Germany.\n\n\"Snowden\" screened at Comic-Con on July 21, 2016, before premiering at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2016. The film was theatrically released in the United States on September 16, 2016, by Open Road Films and on September 22 in Germany. It received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised Gordon-Levitt's performance but criticized the screenplay. It was also a box office disappointment, grossing $37.3 million worldwide against its $40 million budget.\n\nIn 2013, Edward Snowden arranges a clandestine meeting in Hong Kong with documentarian Laura Poitras and journalist Glenn Greenwald. They discuss releasing the classified information in the former’s possession regarding illegal mass surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA).\n\nIn 2004, Snowden is undergoing basic training, having enlisted in the U.S. Army with intentions of matriculating to the Special Forces. He eventually fractures his tibia, and is informed that he will be receiving an administrative discharge and that he may serve his country in other ways.\n\nSnowden applies for a position at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and subsequently undergoes the screening process. Initially, his answers to the screening questions are insufficient, but Deputy Director Corbin O'Brian decides to take a chance on him, given the demands of such extraordinary times. Snowden is then brought to \"The Farm\" where he is educated and tested on cyberwarfare. He learns about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which circumvents the Fourth Amendment rights of U.S. citizens by allowing warrant requests to be approved by a panel of judges that were appointed by the Chief Justice. Snowden and his peers are each tasked with building a covert communications network in their hometown, deleting it, and then rebuilding it in eight hours or less, with five hours being the average time taken. Snowden impresses O'Brian when he completes the exercise in 38 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, Snowden meets Lindsay Mills via a dating website. The two bond, despite sharply contrasting political ideologies. Snowden acquires his first post abroad working with diplomatic cover in Geneva in 2007, taking Mills with him. He meets Gabriel Sol, who has ample experience in electronic surveillance. Snowden begins questioning the ethical implications of their assignment. After his superior decides to set up their target on a DUI charge in order to leverage information from him, Snowden resigns from the CIA.\n\nSnowden later takes a position with the NSA in Japan, initially under the pretense of building a program that would allow the government to back up all critical data from the Middle East in an emergency, a program which he names \"Epic Shelter\". Snowden learns of the practices the NSA and other U.S. government agencies are using not just in Japan, but in most countries which the U.S. is currently allied with, which include planting malware in different computers that manage government, infrastructure and financial sectors so that, in the event that any allies turn against the US, that country can effectively be shut down in retaliation. The stress associated with the job results in the end of his relationship with Mills, who moves back with her family in Maryland.\n\nThree months later, Snowden has left his post with the NSA and returned to Maryland where he and Mills resume their relationship and he takes a position consulting for the CIA. During a hunting trip, O'Brian reveals an operation in Oahu that revolves around counterattacking Chinese hackers. After Snowden is diagnosed with epilepsy, Mills agrees that he should join the operation for she believes the environment in Hawaii may be beneficial for his health. Upon beginning his new job in \"The Tunnel\", an underground World War II bunker that has been re-purposed for massive electronic surveillance and SIGINT operations, Snowden learns that Epic Shelter is actually providing real-time data that assists U.S. drone pilots in launching lethal strikes against terror suspects in Pakistan.\n\nSnowden ultimately becomes disillusioned with what he is a part of. It culminates in Snowden smuggling a microSD card into his office by way of a Rubik's Cube, and loading all relevant data. He then tells his colleagues he is feeling ill and departs. He advises Mills to fly home to Maryland, after which he contacts Poitras and Greenwald to schedule the meeting.\n\nWith the help of journalist Ewen MacAskill, the information is disseminated to the press on June 5, 2013, with additional leaks published in the following days. In the aftermath, with the help of MacAskill, Greenwald and Poitras, Snowden is smuggled out of Hong Kong on a flight bound for Latin America by way of Russia. However, the U.S. government revokes his passport, forcing him to remain in Moscow indefinitely. He is eventually granted asylum for three years, with Mills joining him at a later date. Snowden continues his activism.\n\nWhen Oliver Stone was first approached to help the film, he was hesitant. At the time, he was working on another controversial subject, about the last few years in the life of Martin Luther King Jr., with Jamie Foxx attached to star, and did not immediately wish to tackle a project as incendiary again. He had been previously criticized for being too apathetic towards George W. Bush – despite calling him the second worst President in U.S. history only after Richard Nixon – in his film, \"W.\" (2008). Nonetheless, a series of events and persuasion prompted him to finally agree to direct it. Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who worked with Laura Poitras to break the Snowden story, asked him for some advice; a couple of months later, Snowden's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, contacted Stone via his producer asking to meet him. Wanting to sell his book about Snowden, Kucherena arranged a meeting in Moscow, in a secure place that Stone would not reveal. It was a fictional book, but Stone developed an interest towards it and called it \"very Fyodor Dostoyevsky\", in the sense that none of it is realistic. Stone, who did not know if Snowden would cooperate, was undecided whether to make a fictional film with an unnamed character or a story as realistic as possible.\n\nStone began meeting with Edward Snowden in January 2014. At first, Snowden was wary about the idea of turning his life into a film. Stone went to meet Snowden two more times in late May of that year, and Snowden finally agreed to the idea and even decided to take part. Although he became involved in the project, he was given no script approval, nor did he receive any payment for the film. Payment was instead given to \"The Guardian\". Snowden had seen a piece of \"Oliver Stone's Untold History of the United States\" and was fascinated by it. Columbia Pictures already had the rights to Greenwald's book on the case.\n\nOn June 2, 2014, it was announced that Stone and Moritz Borman had acquired the rights to the nonfiction book \"The Snowden Files\" by Luke Harding, and that Stone would write and direct a film based on it. The film on Martin Luther King Jr. was scrapped since Stone was committed to direct \"Snowden\" instead. Eight days later, on June 10, 2014, Stone acquired the rights to another book, \"Time of the Octopus\", by Kucherena. (In April 2015, WikiLeaks revealed that Stone paid $700,000 for the rights to Harding's book and $1 million for the rights to Kucherena's novel.) Stone used both books as the sources for his screenplay. On November 6, 2014, Open Road Films acquired the U.S. rights to the film, while Wild Bunch was set to handle foreign sales. \"Deadline Hollywood\" confirmed on November 10, 2014, that Endgame Entertainment had come on board to produce the film.\n\nBefore production began, Stone and Gordon-Levitt met Snowden in 2015 in Moscow, where he had been living in exile with his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, since evading the U.S. government's attempts to arrest him for espionage. The U.S. government had revoked his passport while Snowden was trying to reach South America. Gordon-Levitt described Snowden as a person who is akin to Philippe Petit, whom Gordon-Levitt played in the 2015 film \"The Walk\". Problems arose in Russia, however, as companies that were affiliated with the U.S. refused to become involved in the project, and no studio was ready to support it. It became extremely difficult for Stone, who had to finance everything along with the producer. Eventually, financing came through from France and Germany, and the film ended up being shot in Germany as a German production, with contracts being signed eight days before production began. Since the budget was too tight, Stone had to miss the funeral of his mother, who had died in America while filming was occurring in Germany. Going back to America would have meant that Stone would have had to cut four days of work, which he said he could not afford to do.\n\nOn September 21, 2014, Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in talks to play Edward Snowden, the American computer professional who leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) to the mainstream media starting in June 2013. On November 10, 2014, news confirmed that Gordon-Levitt would be starring in the lead role. On November 14, 2014, Shailene Woodley was in final talks to join the film, to play Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsay Mills. On February 2, 2015, Scott Eastwood joined the cast to play an NSA agent. On February 4, 2015, three more actors joined the cast; Melissa Leo played documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras, who filmed the most famous recording of Snowden, Zachary Quinto played Glenn Greenwald, the journalist chosen by Snowden to leak sensitive information, and Tom Wilkinson played Ewen MacAskill, defense and intelligence correspondent for \"The Guardian\", who helped report the Snowden story. On February 13, 2015, \"Variety\" reported that Ben Schnetzer had also joined the film. On February 19, 2015, Timothy Olyphant joined the film to star as a CIA agent who befriended Snowden before he left for Russia, and Rhys Ifans and Joely Richardson were added to the cast of the film on February 20, 2015. On February 23, 2015, Nicolas Cage also signed on to play the role of a former US Intelligence official. Keith Stanfield was added to the cast on February 25, 2015, to play an NSA co-worker and a close friend to Snowden.\n\nFor his role as Snowden, Joseph Gordon-Levitt pledged to donate his entire salary from the film to \"help facilitate the conversation\" about the relationship between technology and democracy.\n\nPrincipal photography began on February 16, 2015 in Munich, Germany. Shooting was underway in Washington, D.C. in early April, and shooting in Hawaii began on April 15 and lasted until April 18. The house used to film is on the same street Snowden lived on. At the end of April, Hong Kong press reported that crews started filming in The Mira Hong Kong, followed by outdoor filming in some old buildings in To Kwa Wan. Shooting lasted until mid-May.\n\nDue to fear of interference by the National Security Agency, Stone decided to shoot the film mostly outside of the United States. \"We felt like we were at risk here. We didn’t know what the NSA might do, so we ended up in Munich, which was a beautiful experience,\" Stone said. Due to fears of the film leaking, Stone employed self-described ethical hacker Ralph Echemendia as a technical supervisor, and made sure all cast and crew used a secure chat-and-file-sharing program.\n\nPeter Gabriel's song \"The Veil\" was composed especially for the film.\n\nOn February 20, 2015, Open Road Films set the film for a December 25, 2015 domestic release date. Pathé would release the film in France on December 30, 2015, and Universum Film would release it in Germany on January 7, 2016. However, in September 2015, Open Road moved the film from its December release date to 2016. The studio did not give reasons for the delay; however, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that maybe it was because the film was not finished yet. On October 7, 2015, the film was set for a May 13, 2016 release. On February 19, 2016, the release date was again pushed back to September 16, at the forefront of awards season. The official trailer was published on April 27, 2016.\n\nThe film was invited to compete at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, as the festival's director, Thierry Frémaux, saw the film, and praised it, calling it a \"really good film. It complements \"Citizenfour\" marvelously. It helps understand a lot of things\". Frémaux said he wanted the film to screen at Cannes, but explained that the film's producers \"want to aim for the Oscars, so for them a Cannes premiere was a little too early\". It was shown at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, and had its European premiere at the 64th San Sebastián Film Festival.\n\nStone held a private screening of \"Snowden\" at the former home of Ernest Hemingway in Sun Valley, for an invited audience of around two dozen, including actress Melissa Leo, who portrayed documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras. Guests were required to sign non-disclosure agreements. The film received critical praise from the attendees, and one audience member was quoted saying, \"What he did that's so brilliant is, he gave this kid's whole back story, so you really like him.\"\n\nThe film had an invitation-only screening at San Diego Comic-Con on July 21, 2016. A second trailer for the film was released at the event.\n\n\"Snowden\" grossed $21.6 million in the United States and Canada and $15.7 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $37.3 million, against a production budget of $40 million.\n\nThe film was released on September 16, 2016, alongside \"Blair Witch\", \"Bridget Jones's Baby\" and \"\", and was projected to gross around $10 million from 2,443 theaters in its opening weekend. It went on to open to $8 million, finishing 4th at the box office. It marked the lowest opening of Oliver Stone's career for a film playing in over 2,000 theaters. The movie is rated R for sexual content, brief nudity, and language.\n\n\"Snowden\" received mixed reviews from critics, although Gordon-Levitt's performance garnered critical praise. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 61%, based on 242 reviews, with an average score of 6.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Snowden\" boasts a thrilling fact-based tale and a solid lead performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, even if director Oliver Stone saps the story of some of its impact by playing it safe.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRichard Roeper gave the film three out of four stars, saying, \"\"Snowden\" works best when it's just Edward and the three journalists in that hotel room, sweating it out, or when we see the pattern of events that led him to commit acts that exposed the shocking practices of our own government that also quite possibly created serious security breaches.\"\n\nOn 19 November 2016, during the Camerimage festival, cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle received the Bronze Frog award for his work on this film.\n\n"}
{"id": "19651298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19651298", "title": "Soup", "text": "Soup\n\nSoup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or hot (but may be cool or cold), that is made by combining ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock, juice, water, or another liquid. Hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a broth.\n\nIn traditional French cuisine, soups are classified into two main groups: \"clear soups\" and \"thick soups\". The established French classifications of clear soups are \"bouillon\" and \"consommé\". Thick soups are classified depending upon the type of thickening agent used: \"purées\" are vegetable soups thickened with starch; \"bisques\" are made from puréed shellfish or vegetables thickened with \"cream\"; cream soups may be thickened with béchamel sauce; and \"veloutés\" are thickened with eggs, butter, and cream. Other ingredients commonly used to thicken soups and broths include egg, rice, lentils, flour, and grains; many popular soups also include pumpkin, carrots, and potatoes.\n\nSoups are similar to stews, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two; however, soups generally have more liquid (broth) than stews.\n\nEvidence of the existence of soup can be found as far back as about 20,000 BC. Boiling was not a common cooking technique until the invention of waterproof containers (which probably came in the form of clay vessels). Animal hides and watertight baskets of bark or reeds were used before this. To boil the water hot rocks were used. This method was also used to cook acorns and other plants.\n\nThe word \"soup\" comes from French \"soupe\" (\"soup\", \"broth\"), which comes through Vulgar Latin \"suppa\" (\"bread soaked in broth\") from a Germanic source, from which also comes the word \"sop\", a piece of bread used to soak up soup or a thick stew.\n\nThe word \"restaurant\" (meaning \"[something] restoring\") was first used in France in the 16th century, to refer to a highly concentrated, inexpensive soup, sold by street vendors, that was advertised as an antidote to physical exhaustion. In 1765, a Parisian entrepreneur opened a shop specializing in such soups. This prompted the use of the modern word \"restaurant\" for the eating establishments.\n\nIn the US, the first colonial cookbook was published by William Parks in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1742, based on Eliza Smith's \"The Compleat Housewife; or Accomplished Gentlewoman's Companion\", and it included several recipes for soups and bisques. A 1772 cookbook, \"The Frugal Housewife\", contained an entire chapter on the topic. English cooking dominated early colonial cooking; but as new immigrants arrived from other countries, other national soups gained popularity. In particular, German immigrants living in Pennsylvania were famous for their potato soups. In 1794, Jean Baptiste Gilbert Payplat dis Julien, a refugee from the French Revolution, opened an eating establishment in Boston called \"The Restorator\", and became known as the \"Prince of Soups\". The first American cooking pamphlet dedicated to soup recipes was written in 1882 by Emma Ewing: \"Soups and Soup Making\".\n\nPortable soup was devised in the 18th century by boiling seasoned meat until a thick, resinous syrup was left that could be dried and stored for months at a time.\n\nCommercial soup became popular with the invention of canning in the 19th century, and today a great variety of canned and dried soups are on the market.\n\nCanned soup (condensed with liquid added, also called \"ready-to-eat\") can be prepared by simply heating in a pan, rather than actually cooking anything. It can be made on the stovetop or in the microwave. Such soups can be used as a base for homemade soups, with the consumer adding anything from a few vegetables to eggs, meat, cream or pasta.\nDoctor John T. Dorrance, a chemist with the Campbell Soup Company, invented condensed soup in 1897. Canned soup can be condensed, in which case it is prepared by adding water (or sometimes milk), or it can be \"ready-to-eat\", meaning that no additional liquid is needed before eating. Condensing soup allows soup to be packaged into a smaller can and sold at a lower price than other canned soups. The soup is usually doubled in volume by adding a \"can full\" of water or milk, about .\n\nSince the 1990s, the canned soup market has burgeoned, with non-condensed soups marketed as \"ready-to-eat\", so they require no additional liquid to prepare. Microwaveable bowls have expanded the \"ready-to-eat\" canned soup market even more, offering convenience (especially in workplaces), and making for popular lunch items. In response to concerns over the negative health effects of excessive salt intake, some soup manufacturers have introduced reduced-salt versions of popular soups.\n\nToday, Campbell's Tomato (introduced in 1897), Cream of Mushroom, and Chicken Noodle (introduced in 1934) are three of the most popular soups in America. Americans consume approximately 2.5 billion bowls of these three soups alone each year. Other popular brands of soup include Progresso.\n\nDry soup mixes are sold by many manufacturers, and are reconstituted with hot water; other fresh ingredients may then be added.\n\nThe first dried soup was bouillon cubes; the earlier meat extract did not require refrigeration, but was a viscous liquid.\n\nEast Asian-style instant noodle soups include ramen and seasonings, and are marketed as a convenient and inexpensive instant meal, requiring only hot water for preparation.\n\nWestern-style dried soups include vegetable, chicken base, potato, pasta and cheese flavors.\n\nIn French cuisine, soup is often served before other dishes in a meal. In 1970, Richard Olney gave the place of the entrée in a French full menu: \"A dinner that begins with a soup and runs through a fish course, an entrée, a sorbet, a roast, salad, cheese and dessert, and that may be accompanied by from three to six wines, presents a special problem of orchestration\".\n\n\nFruit soups are prepared using fruit as a primary ingredient, and may be served warm or cold depending on the recipe. Many varieties of fruit soups exist, and they may be prepared based upon the availability of seasonal fruit.\n\nCold soups are a particular variation on the traditional soup, wherein the temperature when served is kept at or below room temperature. They may be sweet or savory. In summer, sweet cold soups can form part of a dessert tray. An example of a savory chilled soup is \"gazpacho\", a chilled vegetable-based soup originating from Spain.\n\nA feature of East Asian soups not normally found in Western cuisine is the use of tofu in soups. Many traditional East Asian soups are typically broths, \"clear soups\", or starch thickened soups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the English language, the word \"soup\" has developed several uses in phrase.\n\n\n"}

Thor is owned by Telenor. Marcopolo 1 launched on 27 August 1989 on the 187th launch of a Delta rocket, and Marcopolo 2 launched on 17 August 1990, on a Delta II rocket. Marcopolo I had the Hughes designation HS376.\n\nAlthough the satellites performed as designed, BSB merged with Sky Television to form British Sky Broadcasting and the BSB satellites were sold off and renamed. This also resulted in the obsoletion of the Squarial satellite-reception antenna, which was designed to operate with Thor 1 only.\n\nSirius W, previously known as Sirius 1, was launched on 27 August 1989. It was Hughes Space and Communications's first satellite. Marcopolo 1 was sold in December 1993 to Nordic Satellite AB of Sweden and operated until 2000 as Sirius 1 at 5°E. It was then moved to 13°W, and renamed Sirius W. It had 5 K band transponders.\n\nMarcopolo 2 was launched on 18 August 1990. It had 5 K band transponders. It was sold in July 1992 to Telenor of Norway and renamed Thor 1. It was located at 0.8°W. It was switched off in January 2002, and in November of that year it was moved to 7.4°W and reactivated with digital test signals broadcasting toward Scandinavia. Marcopolo 2 was sent up to the junk orbit in early January 2003.\n\nThor 2 was launched on 21 May 1997, and retired in 2008 although it remained in an inclined geostationary orbit until January 2013 when it de-orbited to the graveyard orbit. It weighs 1467 kg, and has 15 K band transponders, with 3 spares, powered by 40-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs).\n\nThor 3 (the \"3\" is officially \"III\") was a satellite used by Canal Digital in the Nordic areas for DTH services. It launched on 9 June 1998 with an expected lifetime at 12 years, and was located at 0.8°W. It had 14 active K band transponders powered by 47-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs). The satellite was targeted on Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and parts of Central Europe. Thor 3 is still in operation and is flying in inclined geostationary orbit but has been pointed towards the middle east. Thor 3 was replaced by Thor 6 in June 2010.\n\nIntelsat 10-02 was launched on 16 June 2004, located at 1°W, and was beamed toward Central Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThor 5 was launched on 11 February 2008. It was first planned that the satellite would be called Thor 2R', but Telenor named it Thor 5. It has 24 active K band transponders.\n\nThor 6 was launched from the Guiana Spaceport on 29 October 2009. Telenor Satellite Broadcasting announced on 15 December that Thor 6 had completed all necessary in-orbit and ground-related testing and would commence commercial service in late December.\n\nThor 6 has 36 K band transponders.
