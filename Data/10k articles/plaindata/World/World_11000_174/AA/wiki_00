Originally built by Baekje, it was occupied in turn by each of the Three Kingdoms. It stands on Achasan Mountain, in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea, at an altitude of 200 meters above sea level. It has a perimeter of roughly 1 kilometer and an area of about 3375 m². \n\nThe first mention of this fortress in historical records comes from the \"Samguk Sagi\"'s statement that King Chaekgye of Baekje ordered it to be fortified against an expected Goguryeo invasion. At that time, Achasanseong Fortress would have played a key role in the defense of the Baekje capital Hanseong from the north. \n\nIn 475, Goguryeo overran this and the other defenses of Baekje, and King Gaero of Baekje was brought to Acha and executed. The fortress and the rest of the Han River valley were conquered by Silla in 553. The Goguryeo general Ondal later died here while trying to reclaim the fortress.\n\nAchasanseong Fortress was designated as a historic landmark in 1973, and has since become a common local tourist destination.\n\n\n"}

On his return to the east, he was ambushed by the Berber-Byzantine coalition led by Caecilius at the Battle of Vescera in which he was defeated and killed in 682. Caecilius at that time held undisputed mastery over North Africa and marched to Kairouan in triumph.\n\nWhen Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan became the caliph, he was effective in increasing the size of his empire. Therefore, he ordered Zuhair bin Qais Al-Balawi who was stationed in Barca to lead an army to retake Ifriqiya and its capital Kairouan.\n\nIn order to mount a stronger resistance, Caecilius took a position in the Aurès Mountains in which he can manage to retreat in case of defeat, while the Muslim leader Zuhair took a decision to camp outside Kairouan near the water resources.\n\nAfter a heavy battle in the valley of Mamma, the Arab invaders eventually managed to defeat the defending troops and to kill their legendary king Caecilius.\n\nThe Arab leader Zuhair and his troops went back to Barca to fight against the invading Byzantines. The incoming ships of Byzantines came with large number of soldiers in which they defeated the Arabs and killed Zuhair.\n\nDihya succeeded Caecilius as the war leader of the Berber tribes and opposed the encroaching Arab Islamic armies of the Umayyad Dynasty. Another Arab general Hasan ibn al-Nu'man marched from Egypt and captured the major Byzantine city of Carthage and other cities after the Battle of Carthage. Searching for another enemy to defeat, he was told that the most powerful monarch in North Africa was Dihyā, and accordingly marched into Numidia. The armies met near Meskiana in the present-day province of Oum el-Bouaghi, Algeria. She defeated Hasan so soundly that he fled Ifriqiya and holed up in Cyrenaica for four or five years.\n"}

The heads are mostly the directors-general of the departments in charge of immovable heritage within the national relevant ministries (Ministry of Culture, Environment, etc.).\n\nDiscussion centres on emerging trends, political engagement, European legislation and the scope of international heritage protection and how these affect national heritage policies and impact upon historic monuments, sites and urban centres. The Council of Europe, the European Commission, as well as the representatives of the civil society are associated with the activities of the EHHF by attending the annual meetings and encouraging the impact assessment of the cultural heritage sector at EU level. The EHHF acts as an advocate for heritage and produces strong statements on specific issues to support common concerns.\n\nA European Heritage Summit was first organised in London on 26–28 April 2006 by Dr. Simon Thurley, former Chief Executive Officer of English Heritage. The mission of the Summit was to gather for the first time the European heritage leaders who had the opportunity to exchange their experience and initiate common actions. It was attended by 23 European states which agreed in the Final Statement to continue to meet annually as a forum of European heritage heads, known as the “European Heritage Heads Forum”. The following EHHF annual meetings have been successively hosted by different countries.\n\nIn May 2014, the EHHF annual meeting was attended by a record of 26 European states.\n\nThe steering committee of the EHHF is a Troika composed of the head, or heads, of heritage of the country which hosted the annual meeting in the previous year and the heads of the countries which will host the subsequent two meetings. Troika meetings are chaired by the host of the next annual meeting. Future hosting countries are chosen by general agreement at the annual meeting.\n\nThe EHHF Secretariat reports to the Troika and is responsible for organising the annual meetings, circulating information to EHHF members, following-up the actions agreed by the EHHF, maintaining the EHHF website and upholding the original purpose for the informal meeting of the heads of the European heritage agencies to: \n\nSince January 2014, a permanent administrative secretary has been appointed to manage the EHHF Secretariat along with the Troika members.

The heads agreed in their Final Statement to the creation of a sub-committee to improve their capacity for early identification of EU legislation which may pose a potential threat to cultural heritage. A forum of legal experts appointed by the national competent authorities was subsequently formed which reports to the EHHF. The mission of the EHLF is to ensure that relevant information on the development and potential consequences of proposed legislation developed by the European Union is circulated in a timely manner to heritage state authorities. In addition to this monitoring task, the EHLF may make recommendations to the EHHF for revised wording of the draft legislation and possible exemptions for cultural heritage.\n\n"}

The meanings of \"state\" and \"very small\" are not well-defined in international law. Recent attempts, since 2010, to define microstates have focused on identifying political entities with unique qualitative features linked to their geographic or demographic limitations. According to a qualitative definition, microstates are: \"modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.\" In line with this and most other definitions, examples of microstates include Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, the Cook Islands, Niue, and the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nThe smallest political unit recognized as a sovereign state is Vatican City, with 842 citizens as of July 2013 and an area of only . However, some scholars dispute qualifying the Vatican as a state, arguing that it does not meet the \"traditional criteria of statehood\" and that the \"special status of the Vatican City is probably best regarded as a means of ensuring that the Pope can freely exercise his spiritual functions, and in this respect is loosely analogous to that of the headquarters of international organisations.\"\n\nMicrostates are distinct from micronations, which are not recognized as sovereign states. Special territories without full sovereignty, such as the British Crown Dependencies, the Chinese Special Administrative Regions and overseas territories of Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Australia, Norway, the United States and the United Kingdom, are also not considered microstates.\n\nMost scholars identify microstates by using a quantitative threshold and applying it to either one variable (such as the size of its territory or population) or a composite of different variables. While it is agreed that microstates are the smallest of all states, there is no consensus on what variable (or variables) or what cut-off point should be used to determine which political units should be labelled as \"microstates\" (as opposed to small \"normal\" states).\n\nWhile employing simple quantitative criteria may seem straightforward, it can also be perceived as potentially problematic. According to some scholars the quantitative approach to defining microstates suffers from such problems as \"inconsistency, arbitrariness, vagueness and inability to meaningfully isolate qualitatively distinct political units\"\n\nIn response to the problems associated with the quantitative definitions of microstates, some academics have suggested finding states with unique features linked to their geographic or demographic smallness. Newer approaches have proposed looking at the behaviour or capacity to operate in the international arena in order to determine which states should deserve the microstate label. Yet, it has been argued that such approaches could lead to either confusing microstates with weak states (or failed states) or relying too much on subjective perceptions.\n\nIn order to address both the problems with quantitative approaches and with definitions based on qualitative features, it has been argued that a useful and meaningful way to isolate microstates from other types of states, would be to see them as \"modern protected states\". According to the definition proposed by Dumienski (2014): \"microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.\" Adopting this approach permits limiting the number of microstates and separating them from both small states and autonomies or dependencies. Examples of microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as: Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco, Niue, Andorra, the Cook Islands or Palau.\n\nA small number of tiny sovereign political units are founded on historical anomalies or eccentric interpretations of law. These types of states, often labelled as \"microstates,\" are usually located on small (usually disputed) territorial enclaves, generate limited economic activity founded on tourism and philatelic and numismatic sales, and are tolerated or ignored by the nations from which they claim to have seceded.\n\nOne example is the Republic of Indian Stream, now the town of Pittsburg, New Hampshire—a geographic anomaly left unresolved by the Treaty of Paris that ended the U.S. Revolutionary War, and claimed by both the U.S. and Canada. Between 1832 and 1835, the area's residents refused to acknowledge either claimant.\n\nAnother example is the Cospaia Republic, which became independent through a treaty error and survived from 1440 to 1826. Its independence made it important in the introduction of tobacco cultivation to Italy.\n\nAnother is Couto Misto, disputed by Spain and Portugal, that operated as a sovereign state in its own right until the 1864 Treaty of Lisbon that partitioned the territory, with the largest part becoming part of Spain.\n"}

{"id": "1883682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1883682", "title": "Rimland", "text": "Rimland\n\nThe Rimland is a concept championed by Nicholas John Spykman, professor of international relations at Yale University. To him geopolitics is the planning of the security policy of a country in terms of its geographical factors. He described the maritime fringe of a country or continent; in particular the densely populated western, southern, and eastern edges of the Eurasian continent.\n\nHe criticized Mackinder for overrating the Heartland as being of immense strategic importance due to its vast size, central geographical location and supremacy of land power rather than sea power. He assumed that the Heartland will not be a potential hub of Europe, because:\n\n\nSpykman thought that the Rimland, the strip of coastal land that encircles Eurasia, is more important than the central Asian zone (the so-called Heartland) for the control of the Eurasian continent. Spykman's vision is at the base of the \"containment politics\" put into effect by the United States in its relation/position to the Soviet Union during the post-World War II period.\n\nThus, 'Heartland' appeared to him to be less important in comparison to 'Rimland.'\n\nAccording to Spykman, \"Who controls the Rimland rules Eurasia, who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world.\"\n\nThe Rimland, Halford Mackinder's \"Inner or Marginal Crescent\", was divided into three sections:\nRimland or inner crescent contains most of world's people as well as large share of world's resources. Rimland is in between Heartland and marginal seas, so it was more important than Heartland. It included Asia minor, Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, South East Asia, China, Korea and East Siberia except Russia.\n\nAll the aforesaid countries lie in the buffer zone that is between sea power and land power.\n\nRimland countries were amphibian states, surrounding the Eurasian continents.\n\nWhile Spykman accepts the first two as defined, he rejects the simple grouping of the Asian countries into one \"monsoon land.\" India, the Indian Ocean littoral, and Indian culture were geographically and civilizationally separate from the Chinese lands.\n\nThe Rimland's defining characteristic is that it is an intermediate region, lying between the heartland and the marginal sea powers. As the amphibious buffer zone between the land powers and sea powers, it must defend itself from both sides, and therein lies its fundamental security problems. Spykman's conception of the Rimland bears greater resemblance to Alfred Thayer Mahan's \"debated and debatable zone\" than to Mackinder's inner or marginal crescent.\n\nThe Rimland has great importance coming from its demographic weight, natural resources, and industrial development. Spykman sees this importance as the reason that the Rimland will be crucial to containing the Heartland (whereas Mackinder had believed that the Outer or Insular Crescent would be the most important factor in the Heartland's containment).\n\nHe called for the consolidation of the Rimland countries to ensure their survival during World War II. With the defeat of Germany and the emergence of the USSR, Spykman's views were embraced during the formulation of the Cold War American policy of containing communist influence.\n\nBut as the states within the Rimland had varying degree of independence, and a variety of castes, races, and culture, it did not come under the control of any single power.\n\n\n"}

FCC", "text": "Satellite Broadcasting &amp; Communications Ass'n v. FCC\n\nSatellite Broadcasting and Communications Association v. FCC, 275 F.3d 337 (4th Cir. 2001) was a case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Congress required satellite television carriers to carry all requesting local broadcast stations in the market where the carrier voluntarily decides to carry one local station in order to, in part, preserve a multiplicity of local broadcast outlets for over-the-air-viewers who do not subscribe either to satellite or cable service.\n\n\"We are delighted that the SBCA Board of Directors has agreed to form a Foundation. Our industry has a presence in every state,\" said SBCA Executive Director, Joe Widoff. \"Workers and their families live in thousands of communities throughout the country and the goal of the Foundation is to help meet the needs of these communities in meaningful ways.\"\n\nThe Fourth Circuit acknowledged that both DBS and cable television operators engage in speech protected by the First Amendment when making channel and content selections. However, the court endorsed the holding in Turner that preserving \"free\" broadcast television constituted a content-neutral measure that imposes only incidental burdens on speech sufficient to pass muster using intermediate First Amendment scrutiny. The court held that imposing mandatory carriage requirements on satellite television operators furthers an important, narrowly drawn governmental interest:\n\nThe Supreme Court has said that the \"principal inquiry in determining content neutrality...is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of [agreement or] disagreement with the message it conveys\". This inquiry involves two steps.\n\n\nCongress chose the second because it feared that cherry picking of major network affiliates within local markets would make it more difficult for non-carried stations in those markets to reach their audiences\n\nAlthough the conferees expect that subscribers who receive no broadcast signals at all from their satellite service may install antennas or subscribe to cable service in addition to satellite service, the Conference Committee is less sanguine that subscribers who receive network signals and hundreds of other programming choices from their satellite carrier will undertake such trouble and expense to obtain over-the-air signals from independent broadcast stations\n\n\nAdditionally, this 10-day notice period runs afoul of federal law as it is a restriction that unreasonably delays or prevents installation, maintenance or use of satellite services. The FCC derived its authority to create the OTARD Rule via the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (\"1996 Act\"). In Section 207 of the 1996 Act, Congress directed the FCC to \"promulgate regulations to prohibit restrictions that impair a viewer's ability to receive video programming services through devices designed for over-the-air reception of television broadcast signals, multichannel multipoint distribution service, or digital broadcast satellite services.\"\n\nThree statutory licenses in the Copyright Act (\"Act\") govern the retransmission of distant and local over-the-air broadcast station signals. There is one statutory license applicable to cable television systems and two statutory licenses applicable to satellite carriers.which are license 111, license 109, and license 120\n\n\nSHVERA provides DBS operators with better opportunities to import distant broadcast signals into markets lacking \"local-into-local\" delivery of nearby signals and localities unserviced by terrestrial broadcast network signals. \nlocal-into-local means that if a satellite customer lives in an area where the satellite company has decided to provide the service, the customer can receive local TV channels. If the company decides that it will not provide local broadcast stations in an area, the consumer may still receive local broadcast stations by using an antenna or basic cable service.\n\nSHVERA also offers DBS operators the opportunity to deliver distant digital network signals into \"digital white areas\" where the nearest network broadcaster does not currently offer digital content, or where adequate off-air reception does not occur.\n\nThe satellite and cable regulatory frameworks attempt to balance a number of longstanding, but potentially conflicting, public policy goals—most notably, localised, competitive provision of video services, support for the creative process, and preservation of free over-the-air broadcast television. They also attempt to balance the interests of the satellite, cable, broadcast, and program content industries. Congress incorporated the sunset provisions in SHVERA because of its concern that market changes could affect these balances.\nThe statutory provisions distinguish between the retransmission of local signals—the broadcast signals of stations located in the same local market as the subscriber—and of distant signals. Provisions block or restrict the retransmission of many distant broadcast signals in order to protect local broadcasters from competition from distant signals and to provide them with a stronger negotiating position vis-à-vis the satellite and cable operators, with the intention of fostering local programming. But the regulatory framework also recognizes that U.S. households benefit from the receipt of certain distant broadcast signals and includes explicit retransmission and copyright rules for these.\n\nThis Act modified the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988. SHVIA permits satellite broadcasters to provide local broadcast TV signals to all their subscribers in that local TV station's market. SHVIA also permits satellite broadcasters (satellite broadcasters. 2000-2001) to provide \"distant\" or national broadcast programming to subscribers. SHIVA Fact Sheet\n\nCarry one.carry all\nThe National Association of Broadcasters, which did not return requests for comment, is probably going to be unhappy because the FCC plans to allow DirecTV and Dish to down convert broadcasters' HD signals to a less pristine picture resolution for several years.\nThe satellite giants-which combined serve about 30 million pay-TV subscribers-convinced FCC officials that they lacked the channel capacity to provide every eligible station in HD immediately. They insisted that they needed several years to prepare for a full HD carriage requirement.\nHD signals stress capacity because they take up much more bandwidth than digital signal transmitted at lower resolution.\nThe FCC's HD rules for satellite were far more lenient than the ones originally proposed by FCC chairman Kevin Martin. He started off at full HD carriage in February 2009, coupled with a market-by-market waiver process.\nMartin scuttled his original plan after DirecTV and Dish Network complained that it was draconian and damaging to their ability to compete with cable.\nInstead, the FCC decided to give DirecTV and EchoStar until 2013 to carry all stations in HD within any market where they have elected to carry any station's signal in HD format.\nThe \"carry one, carry all in HD\" principle kicks in when a satellite company starts carrying local signals in HD. DirecTV's decision to carry local TV signals in HD does not force Dish to do likewise in the same market.\n\nRogers, Circuit Judge: Following enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Federal Communications Commission promulgated a rule prohibiting restrictions on certain over-the-air reception devices (\"OTARD\"). The rule invalidated\n\n"}

Linking the term fragility (\"on glass\") is an obvious result of long-standing clashes with a great deal of disruptive influence, light chaos and, in general, a propensity for devastating conflicts in these regions. Hence, the term \"shatter belt\" itself is generally referring to a geographical region that is endangered by local conflicts within the states or between countries in the region, as well as the involvement of the opposing great powers outside the region. The concept of the shatter belt - a fragment of fragility in geopolitics is still defined as strategically positioned and oriented regions that are both deeply internally divided and captured in the competition between the great powers in the geostrategic areas and spheres. Regions marked as a fragile belt are often blamed for a large scale of interstate / conflict, especially in relation to major power conflicts. Regarding their engagement and close connection with major and global conflicts of power, the regions considered as shatter belts are at the same time the main crisis hot spots or hard-to-reach areas in world politics and international relations. Therefore, both the analogy and the comparison with the in geology where active Shatter belts i.e. faults in geology scattered zones are common places of earthquake occurrence. Therefore, unlike most geopolitical regions that have a different degree of cohesion, the regions that are considered as fragile bands are global destabilizers. Throughout the twentieth century the Balkans were in this position. Today the Caucasus region would fit the definition.\n"}

It was founded by Maurice Strong, its first director, as a result of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Conference) in June 1972 and has overall responsibility for environmental problems among United Nations agencies; however, international talks on specialized issues, such as addressing climate change or combating desertification, are overseen by other UN organizations, like the Bonn-based Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. UNEP's activities cover a wide range of issues regarding the atmosphere, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, environmental governance and green economy. It has played a significant role in developing international environmental conventions, promoting environmental science and information and illustrating the way those can be implemented in conjunction with policy, working on the development and implementation of policy with national governments, regional institutions in conjunction with environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs). UNEP has also been active in funding and implementing environment related development projects.\n\nUNEP frequently uses the alternative name UN Environment. \n\nUN Environment has aided in the formulation of guidelines and treaties on issues such as the international trade in potentially harmful chemicals, transboundary air pollution, and contamination of international waterways. Relevant documents, including scientific papers, are available via the UNEP Document Repository.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization and UN Environment established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. UN Environment is also one of several Implementing Agencies for the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol, and it is also a member of the United Nations Development Group. The International Cyanide Management Code, a programme of best practice for the chemical's use at gold mining operations, was developed under UN Environment's aegis.\n\nUNEP headquarters was established in Nairobi, Kenya, on 5 June 1972 as an outcome from the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972) with a staff of 300, including 100 professionals in a variety of fields, and with a five‐year fund of more than US$100 million. At the time, US$40 million were pledged by the United States and the remainder by 50 other nations.\n\nUNEP's current acting Executive Director Joyce Msuya took office in November 2018, following the resignation of Erik Solheim. Prior to that appointment, she was UNEP's Deputy Executive Director. \n\nIn December 1972, the UN General Assembly unanimously elected Maurice Strong to be the first head of UN Environment. Also Secretary General of both the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which launched the world environment movement, and the 1992 Earth Summit, Strong has played a critical role is globalizing the environmental movement.\n\nThe position was then held for 17 years (1975–1992) by Dr. Mostafa Kamal Tolba, who was instrumental in bringing environmental considerations to the forefront of global thinking and action. Under his leadership, UN Environment's most widely acclaimed success—the historic 1987 agreement to protect the ozone layer—the Montreal Protocol was negotiated. He was succeeded by Elizabeth Dowdeswell (1992–1998), Klaus Töpfer (1998–2006), Achim Steiner (2006–2016), and Erik Solheim (2016–2018).\n\nUNEP's structure includes seven substantive Divisions:\n\n\nUNEP's main activities are related to:\n\n\nUNEP has registered several successes, such as the 1987 Montreal Protocol for limiting emissions of gases blamed for thinning the planet's protective ozone layer, and the 2012 Minamata Convention, a treaty to limit toxic mercury.\n\nUNEP has sponsored the development of solar loan programmes, with attractive return rates, to buffer the initial deployment costs and entice consumers to consider and purchase solar PV systems. The most famous example is the solar loan programme sponsored by UN Environment helped 100,000 people finance solar power systems in India. Success in India's solar programme has led to similar projects in other parts of the developing world, including Tunisia, Morocco, Indonesia and Mexico.\n\nUNEP sponsors the Marshlands project in the Middle East. In 2001, UN Environment alerted the international community to the destruction of the Marshlands when it released satellite images showing that 90 percent of the Marshlands had already been lost. The UN Environment \"support for Environmental Management of the Iraqi Marshland\" commenced in August 2004, in order to manage the Marshland area in an environmentally sound manner.\n\nIn order to ensure full participation of global communities, UN Environment works in an inclusive fashion that brings on board different societal cohorts. UN Environment has a programme for young people known as Tunza. Within this programme are other projects like the AEO for Youth.\n\nGlaciers shrinking\nGlaciers are shrinking at record rates and many could disappear within decades, the U.N. Environment Programme said on 16 March 2008. The scientists measuring the health of almost 30 glaciers around the world found that ice loss reached record levels in 2006. On average, the glaciers shrank by 4.9 feet in 2006, the most recent year for which data are available. The most severe loss was recorded at Norway's Breidalblikkbrea glacier, which shrank 10.2 feet in 2006. Glaciers lost an average of about a foot of ice a year between 1980 and 1999. But since the turn of the millennium the average loss has increased to about 20 inches.\n\nElectric vehicles\n\nAt the fifth Magdeburg Environmental Forum held from 3–4 July 2008, in Magdeburg, Germany, UN Environment and car manufacturer Daimler called for the establishment of infrastructure for electric vehicles. At this international conference, 250 high-ranking representatives from the world of politics and non-government organizations discussed solutions for future road transportation under the motto of \"Sustainable Mobility–the Post-2012 CO2 Agenda\".\n\nUNEP publishes many reports, atlases and newsletters. For instance, the fifth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-5) assessment is a comprehensive report on environment, development and human well-being, providing analysis and information for policy makers and the concerned public. One of many points in the GEO-5 warns that we are living far beyond our means.
