In 2014, the ONG stated that 150 honor killings affected Afghan women each year. Upon the progressive withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the AWN brought its focus on maintaining the women's rights benefits gained during the presence of the US troops.\n\nIn February 2015, the AWN took part to the marches asking the president Ashraf Ghani to respect his word and name 4 women ministries in his government for fair gender representation. In 2016, the ONG spoke out about the revival of public executions of women in Afghanistan following the new peak of influence from the Talibans.\n\n\n\n\n"}

While Icelandic politicians disagreed with such a move. Hence the Agreed Minute, signed in 1994 where both parties compromised and came to an understanding.\n\nThe Agreed Minute was last renegotiated in 2001. At the time, the U.S. Air Force committed itself to maintaining four to six interceptors at the Keflavík base, supported by a helicopter rescue squad. The Air Force, in order to cut costs, announced plans to remove the four remaining jets in 2003. The removal was then delayed to address Icelandic demands for continued presence of the jets. After an unfruitful series of negotiations and two reshufflings of the Icelandic government the issue lay dormant until early 2006 when the U.S. Air Force issued an official statement that withdrawal of the aircraft was already being prepared. U.S. officials have since then argued that Iceland is in no need of U.S. military presence and the last remaining airmen left Iceland during September 2006.\n"}
