It has been referred to as a Manx Magna Carta as its aim was to preserve the rights of the peasants in relation to their Lord. In the 16th century, tenants on the Isle had begun to consider their estates as their own but at the end of that century restrictions began to be enforced. An ordinance in 1582 stated that lands were not to be alienated (bought and sold, or left in wills) except by the Lord's license, which came with a fine. This was repealed in 1608 but reimposed in 1645. This situation was not popular among tenants who found themselves losing rights they had previously considered their own. By the last quarter of the century alienation fines were being successfully imposed. These fines made it difficult for tenants to get by and many had to abandon their land. This situation could not continue and in 1703 Bishop Wilson travelled to speak with the Earl on behalf of the tenants with a view to settling the issue. The Earl agreed to restore to his tenants their ancestral estates and impose significantly smaller fines (a third of the previous levels) and, in the case of inheritance, to allow a year for these fines to be paid. The Act was re-enacted in 1777 after revestment, and is today considered the foundation of the Island's constitution.\n\n"}

The battle was part of the civil war that was taking place in Iceland at the time between various powerful clans during the time known as the Age of the Sturlungs.\n\nThe Battle of Örlygsstaðir was fought on 21 August 1238 between Sighvatur Sturluson (brother of Snorri Sturluson) and his son Sturla Sighvatsson on the one hand, and Kolbeinn ungi and Gissur Þorvaldsson (later Earl Gissur) on the other. Sighvatur had nearly 500 men but there no evidence available of the size of Sturla's following. Nonetheless, historians estimate that the Sturlungar had a total of 1000 men. Gissur and Kolbeinn had almost 1700 men in total. The areas controlled by the Sturlungar were more populous but the settlements were more scattered which made it difficult for the Sturlungar to assemble fighting men.\n\nThe Ásbirningar and Haukdælir clans emerged victorious after a short battle. Over 50 men were killed on that day, including Sighvatur and Sturla. According to Saga of the Icelanders, Gissur only lost seven men whereas Kolbeinn lost none.\n\nFive others, including Þórir Jökull Steinfinnsson, were executed by beheading following the battle. The names of those who perished on that day are recorded in the \"Íslendinga saga\" which is included as a part of the \"Sturlunga saga\".\n\nIn 1988 a memorial was raised on the site of the battle, which describes the battle.\n\n"}

{"id": "49253608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49253608", "title": "Black Cross Nurses", "text": "Black Cross Nurses\n\nBlack Cross Nurses (officially the Universal African Black Cross Nurses) is an international organization of nurses which was founded in 1920, based upon the model of the Red Cross. The organization was the women's auxiliary of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League and was established to provide health services and education to people of African descent.\n\nIn 1920, Henrietta Vinton Davis established the Black Cross Nurses (BCN) in Philadelphia as an auxiliary of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA). The BCN served as the women's auxiliary of the UNIA, placing women in a supportive role, while the men's auxiliary served in a protective role. Marcus Garvey wanted everyone in the UNIA to feel they belonged within the organization, and the BCN served that purpose for women.\n\nThe BCN was based on the World War I nursing model of the Red Cross. Local chapters were established with a matron, head nurse, secretary and treasurer to provide health services and hygiene education to black members of the community. Few programs existed which would admit people of African descent into nursing training at the time and many health facilities provided unequal care to black patrons; one of the goals of the organization was addressing these discrepancies. Doctors, nurses and lay practitioners took courses ranging from six months to a year to make sure that standardized care was being given. In addition, upon graduation from the course, each member was required to purchase and wear their official uniform.\n\nIn many ways, the organization functioned as a social reform movement, while developing role models for young women. It promoted education, good health and hygiene, juvenile rehabilitation, maternal and infant care, and training in proper nutrition. It also provided a professional, organized structure for members, giving them a means to appear in roles of public leadership. In articles which appeared in the \"Negro World\", nurses addressed a wide variety of topics from advice to expectant mothers to contagious diseases, heart disease, and hygiene, as well as descriptions of the conditions, symptoms, and treatment options. Benevolent community service included distributing clothing and food to those in need.\n\nThe requirements of membership were that the women be active members of the UNIA, between 15 and 45 years old and \"of Negro blood and African descent\". Nurses were also required to be able to read and write in order to promote literacy in their communities and serve as examples to others. As an overriding goal, the organization used social health concerns to uplift the black race from degeneracy, believing that by creating a sanitary living environment, the community would prosper. Units quickly formed in cities across the United States, as well as in The Caribbean and Central America.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the United States UNIA organizations spread into thirty-eight states, and membership in the Black Cross Nurses was in the tens of thousands. The largest branch in the world was located in Harlem. Within a few years of the formal organization of the Black Cross Nurses, there were chapters in Alabama, Chicago, California, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia, with international chapters in Belize, Nova Scotia, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago. By 1927, membership had declined, but the Black Cross Nurses provided education for African-American nurses and health care access to African Americans in their communities through the 1960s.\n\nAll white uniforms including dress, shoes, stockings and a cap adorned with a black cross encircled by a red background with a green center were worn for dress and official functions. Duty uniforms, consisted of a green dress over which was worn an ivory apron accompanied by black shoes and stockings, set the BCN nurses apart from other nurses and united them as symbolically as members. Green was chosen as a representation of growth and renewal. Criticism of the dress and cape stemmed from a comparison to a nun's habit, while UNIA men's uniforms resembled military attire.\n\nAncillary responsibilities of the BCN included singing in a choir and marching in parades. Choir rehearsals were on Friday. Marching practice was necessary as local chapters participated in parades on holidays such as Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, sometimes carrying the Black Nationalist flag.\n\nThe Belize Black Cross Nurses organization was established in British Honduras in 1920 by Vivian Seay, who led the organization until her death in 1971. Dr. K. Simon, medical officer for the Cayo District, moved to Belize Town in 1921, and began instructing members of the UNIA in midwifery, to combat the high mortality rates for infants and mothers. He urged that members take instruction under Belize Town Public Hospital matron Lois M. Roberts, an Englishwoman, in general hospital procedures and hygiene. As Roberts had been unable to secure sufficient nurses for her training program, she agreed to accept the Black Cross Nurses. By 1922, seventeen of the first training class of twenty nurses passed their exams and were awarded their nursing certificates. By 1923, there were twenty-four certified nurses, who were each assigned a territory in Belize Town to administer to the needs of the poor, as unpaid volunteers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1931 Belize hurricane, the Nurses helped in the Public Hospital and in relief camps. An annual event called the \"Baby Exhibition\", was a competition to award healthy infants in various age categories and display proper parenting to the populace. It was a popular event which consolidated the public perception of the nurses as professionals, since they chose the contestants, and the approval of the government, since the colonial medical authorities determined the winners. They also conducted studies and research on the health of communities, as well as humanitarian projects like the 1934 Palace Unemployed Women's Fund, aimed at providing groceries to unemployed mothers.\n\nSeay, and thus the organization, were staunchly in opposition to universal suffrage. On the one hand, they sought Victorian morality as a means to improve society as a whole and were rigidly opposed to the baser habits of the lower classes while on the other, they expanded women's spheres from within the confines of domesticity. For the first time, middle-class black women, who were trained as nurses, were publicly active and held positions of community leadership. The attempts to control others' morality were not always appreciated and Seay's political involvement and party politics became divisive points, which reflected on the nurses. In the attempt to maintain order, Seay's policies excluded poor and working-class women, while at the same time strengthening middle-class Creole political worth.\n\nThough the organization never came under government control, by 1952 the Black Cross Nurses had influenced the health policies of seven of the colonial governors of British Honduras. It was the most active and lasting black organization in the country, and though it lost momentum after Seay's death was revitalized in the 1980s and continues to serve the humanitarian needs of communities in which its members live.\n\nThe Black Cross Nursing organizations of Cuba sprang up mostly in the areas which were highly influenced by British West Indians and in company towns like those that existed for the United Fruit Company. The organization in Banes, Cuba, was developed as an avenue to create acceptance and respectability for blacks, promoting pan-Africanism. The organization thrived until 1932 when the combination of economic depression and rising Cuban Nationalism turned toward labor militancy and communism.\n\nThe Black Cross Nursing organization of Jamaica was organized in 1922. Sarah Grant, who had trained students at Victoria Jubilee Hospital, trained 29 nurses, though their training remained rudimentary and the organization was always a volunteer auxiliary which did not develop into a strong organization.\n\nIn Canada, the Black Cross Nursing organized as a response to denial of black women's participation in World War I efforts to assist wounded soldiers. The women organized to provide medical help including child care services, first aid, health care, nutrition education and other services. Approximately 25% of the black population of Canada joined the Universal Negro Improvement Association of Canada and a high percentage of those members were of West Indian heritage, possibly due to the strong identification of people from the Caribbean with the British colour-class system: white rulers; brown, mixed-race middle class; and black, laboring lower class. However another important factor was the higher education level and political awareness of Caribbean-born immigrants compared with other black Canadians. West Indians who immigrated as a whole were ambitious and wanted to improve their communities. The BCN organization served to reinforce these ideals, moving many black women away from traditional domestic work and labor and into universities, though not in Canada. The majority of Canadian higher education and hospital organizations refused training for black women, forcing them to look to traditional black colleges in the United States. The nurses were a vital part of providing health services to the black communities of Montreal, Ontario, Nova Scotia and other provinces. Throughout Canada, UNIA divisions were established in 32 cities and towns, but almost all had waned by the 1940s.\n\n"}

As of November 2007, ICEM represented 467 industrial trade unions in 132 countries, claiming a membership of over 20 million workers.\n\nThe federation was founded in 1995 in Washington DC when the Miners' International Federation merged with the International Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions. In 2006, the small Universal Alliance of Diamond Workers merged into the federation. In June 2012 affiliates of ICEM joined the new global federation IndustriALL Global Union.\n\nThe organization represented workers employed in a wide range of industries, including energy, mining, chemicals and bioscience, pulp and paper, rubber, gems and jewellery, glass, ceramics, cement, environmental services and others.\n\nThe international headquarters of ICEM was based in Brussels, Belgium. This is where the meetings were held of the Presidium and the Executive Committee of ICEM. These governing bodies organized activities on a higher level while the regional offices organized regional conferences, workshops and solidarity actions. The Presidium oversaw the grand line of ICEM whilst the Executive Committee was more involved in the day-to-day routine of the organization. Every four years, starting in 1995, a worldwide congress was organized in which new committee members were elected and policies were changed. The congresses were held in the following order: \n\n\nThe regional offices dealt with specific geographical areas such as Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and North America. The regional office of the Asia Pacific area was housed in Seoul, South Korea. This regional office was one of the most active offices of ICEM. \n\nICEM supported many strikes in various regions including the strike of 7 October 1998 in Russia by communists and the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia during the 1998 Russian Financial Crisis. Affiliates of ICEM have also organized protests in South Africa. ICEM worked together with human rights and environmental activists who were in conflict with multinationals such as Rio Tinto by raising awareness and funding research. \n\nICEM published two quarterly bulletins called 'ICEM Info' and 'ICEM Global' which merged in 2002 to become 'ICEM Global Info'. \n\nRichard Croucher and Elizabeth Cotton's book \"Global Unions, Global Business\" contains a case study of the ICEM's dealings with the Anglo-American mining company. This is in Chapter Eight. The book is published by Middlesex University Press (2009). .\n\nThe archive of ICEM is housed in the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam and is open to the public. \n"}

The recognition for chemistry was made official by the United Nations in December 2008. Events for the year were coordinated by IUPAC, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.\n\nThe UN resolution calling for the International Year of Chemistry in 2011 was submitted by Ethiopia and co-sponsored by 23 nations. A case was made that chemistry makes a vital contribution towards achieving the goals of the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, 2005-2014.\n\nThe theme of IYC2011 was \"Chemistry–our life, our future.\" It focused on the “achievements of chemistry and its contributions to the well-being of humankind.” It aimed to raise awareness of chemistry among the general public and to attract young people into the field, as well as to highlight the role of chemistry in solving global problems.\n\nIYC 2011 events were organized by national chemical societies, such as the American Chemical Society, the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Brazilian Chemical Society, the Society of Chemical Industry and the Royal Australian Chemical Institute, and by regional chemical federations, such as the European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences and the Federation of African Societies of Chemistry.\n\nIUPAC selected 25 women for the Distinguished Women Chemistry/Chemical Engineering Award. These included Ada Yonath of Israel, Chulabhorn Walailak of Thailand, Lesley Yellowlees of the UK and Joanna S. Fowler of the USA.\n\nThe IYC holds a full list of events on its website. Events scheduled were billed as: - conferences, congresses, symposia, fairs, exhibitions, expositions, grand openings, lectures, meetings, open discussions, workshops, celebrations, shows, art exhibitions, and quizzes,\n\nThe IYC Closing Event was held in Brussels, Belgium on 1 December 2011.\n\n\nThe official launch ceremony of the IYC 2011 took place on 27–28 January in Paris at the headquarters of the United Nations Educational Scientific & Cultural Organization (UNESCO). It was attended by 1,000+ delegates from 60 countries. Four Nobel Prize Winners attended. UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova delivered the opening address.\n\nOn February 2011 Swiss Post issued a postage stamp bearing a depiction of a model of a molecule of vitamin C to mark the International Year of Chemistry. Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein synthesised the vitamin for the first time in 1933.\n\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry celebrated IYC 2011 by reviewing the most significant chemical advances since the millennium.\n\nAn international conference was held as an official IYC event at the UNESCO World Heritage Listed Lord Howe Island between 14–18 August entitled 'Towards Global Artificial Photosynthesis: Energy, Nanochemistry and Governance.' \n\nCanada had many demonstrations for the year of chemistry. 32 universities all around Canada participated.\nDalhousie University made a \"chemistry rendezvous\" for the 7th of May. It included a tour of the chemistry lab, food and demonstrations.\n\n\n"}

The language they speak is called iKota, but is sometimes referred to as Bakota, ikuta, Kota, and among the Fang, they are known as Mekora. The language has several dialects, which include: Ndambomo, Mahongwe, Ikota-la-hua, Sake, Menzambi, Bougom. Some of these dialects themselves include regional variations of some kind. \n\nThe Kota are traditionally a patriarchal society, however some of the sub-groups such as the Mahongwe have over time adopted a matrilineal system of lineage (Mahongwe means, \"from your father\").\n\nThe true meaning of Bakota is unclear, however it may be derived from the word kota, which means to bind/to attach/to link, hereby suggesting they view themselves as a united people bound by a common fate.\n\nEstimates indicate that there are at least 43,500 Kota speakers in the world, of whom 34,442 people (79%) live in the Ogouee-Ivindo province of northeastern Gabon, and 9055 people (21%) in neighboring Congo-Brazzaville.\n\nThey are noted for their copper and brass reliquary guardian figures, which are part of a powerful religious and mystical order known as Bwete. Another key feature of the Kota people is the originality of its circumcision and widow-purification rituals, which are generally kept secret.\n\nPolitically, the Kota have been classified under the disputed \"stateless societies\" category. They have a strong egalitarian background, which in some instances cuts across age and gender lines. Kota children are taught to value tradition, respect for the elderly, and the concept of \"Ewele\" (loosely translated as 'pride').\n\nThe Kota are not considered big players in Gabonese politics, however some Kota have been appointed to key positions in the Government. Alexandre Sambat, a long-time ambassador to the United States who later ran for president in 1993, was of Kota origin. Pascal Desire Misongo, another Kota, has served as minister of Justice in Gabon.\n\n"}

{"id": "381932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=381932", "title": "Mushroom Kingdom", "text": "Mushroom Kingdom\n\nThe is a fictional setting in Nintendo's \"Mario series\", where most of the games take place.\n\nThe Mushroom Kingdom is typically presented as a medieval monarchy, with the character Princess Peach being either its ruler or heir. \"Super Mario RPG\" and the \"Paper Mario\" series suggests that the chancellor of the kingdom is its head of government. Though Princess Peach and the Mario Brothers are human, the citizens of the kingdom are the mushroom-like Toads (called \"Kinopios\" in Japan). The Mushroom Kingdom also features other species, such as the dinosaur-like Yoshi, the turtle-like Koopa, and the typically antagonistic mushroom-like creatures called Goomba. The Mushroom Kingdom is often tormented by Bowser, the Koopa King, who kidnaps Princess Peach in nearly all main-series \"Mario\" games. Initially, this was because she had the power to undo Bowser's handiwork, but in recent games, Bowser has developed romantic feelings for the princess. Games in the \"Mario\" series often suggest that the Mushroom Kingdom is a rival of Bowser's domain, the Koopa Kingdom. It is unknown if the Koopa Kingdom is a completely separate area or merely a captured portion of the Mushroom Kingdom.\n\nThe Mushroom Kingdom is the setting of most main-series \"Mario\" games but is presented very inconsistently throughout the series. It is uncertain if many areas in the \"Mario\" franchise are part of the Mushroom Kingdom or the larger \"Mario\" universe. There is no established canon regarding the topography of the \"Mario\" world.\n\nThe Mushroom Kingdom features several locations that have appeared in a large number of \"Mario\" games. These include:\n\nPrincess Peach's Castle, a large Central European-style red-and-white castle inhabited by the Princess and her Toad retainers. Peach's castle first appeared in \"Super Mario RPG\" (1996) and served as the central hub in \"Super Mario 64\". The design of the castle has remained relatively consistent since and it has appeared in games such as \"Mario Kart 64\", \"Paper Mario\", \"\", \"Super Mario Galaxy\", and \"Super Mario Odyssey\" (where it is the Mushroom Kingdom's capital city).\n\nBowser's Castle is the abode of Bowser, arch-villain of the \"Super Mario\" video games. The castle has often been destroyed and rebuilt and appears different in each game that it appears in. It is usually filled with lava pits, booby traps, and Bowser's minions. Variations on Bowser's Castle appear in nearly every \"Mario\" game, and every \"Mario Kart\" game features at least one track titled \"Bowser's Castle\".\n\nToad Town is the capital of the Mushroom Kingdom as seen in the \"Paper Mario\" and \"Mario & Luigi\" series. It is populated by anthropomorphic mushrooms called the Toads. Other species inhabiting Toad Town vary by game but may include Shaman, Koopa Paratroopas, and Doogans.\n\nThe Mushroom Kingdom has been revamped several times over the course of the \"Mario\" games, similar to the kingdom of Hyrule in \"The Legend of Zelda\" series. In \"Super Mario Bros.\", for example, the Mushroom Kingdom encompasses 32 different levels of varying terrain. \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" expanded on this concept by adding topography to the kingdom through means of a map screen.\n\nThe games do not follow these landscape variants exactly, but still are recurring themes in the Mario series. For example, even though \"Super Mario World\" was set in Dinosaur Land, its geography was very similar to the Mushroom Kingdom. The paintings that led to the different levels in \"Super Mario 64\" followed this idea as well.\n\nBlogger Natalie Grigson noted that the grassy fields, mountains, waterfalls, and red-and-white mushrooms seen in the area around Princess Peach's Castle best compares to Oslo, Norway.\n\nThe main mode of transportation in the Mushroom Kingdom has been said to be through warp pipes. The range of these warp pipes vary in length: some pipes merely travel a short distance (such as over and underground), while some pipes are linked to entirely different worlds. New warp tools and areas have been introduced in games since including the secret \"warp whistle\" in \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" and cannons in \"New Super Mario Bros.\". The Mushroom Kingdom consistently features various objects. Dispersed across the land are brown brick blocks and golden \"question-mark blocks\", which may contain coins or power-ups. The instruction manual of \"Super Mario Bros.\" states that Bowser transformed many of the Toads that inhabited the Kingdom into bricks and horsetail plants.\n\nThe \"Super Smash Bros.\" series has thus far included three different levels based on the Mushroom Kingdom. The original game included the unlockable stage \"Mushroom Kingdom\" which was graphically based on the original \"Super Mario Bros.\". \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" included a re-vamped \"Mushroom Kingdom\" which omitted piranha plants and warp pipes from the original stage. A stage titled \"Mushroom Kingdom II\", based on the setting of \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" (Subcon), was also featured in this game. \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" includes a level titled \"Mushroomy Kingdom\", which primarily appears as a dirty, crumbled version of \"World 1-1\" of \"Super Mario Bros.\"\n\nGamesRadar wrote a humorous article listing the \"Top 7 most disturbing things about the Mushroom Kingdom\", listing facts such as \"the kingdom's greatest hero is a dumpy plumber\", \"the political system is a complete mess\", and \"everything is alive\" as examples. Animation Domination High-Def ran a short titled \"Real Plumber in Mario World\", with Kotaku humorously adding \"What the fuck is this place?! Now that’s the sort of down-to-earth question a real plumber would ask when confronted with a magical mushroom kingdom.\" \"Game Informer\" lauded the fact that \"Super Mario Maker\" allowed players to \"build the Mushroom Kingdom of [their] dreams\", writing \"since Mario first won the hearts of gamers across the world in the early ‘80s, fans have been sketching up their own ideas for Mario levels on paper and imagining what sort of worlds they could create for the iconic plumber to explore.\"\n\nA Carnegie Mellon University student created a humorous fanbook that explored the species of flora in the Mushroom Kingdom; this was later recommended to readers by \"Kotaku\". A fan-created mod of \"\" titled \"Super Skyrim Bros\" turns the game environment into the Mushroom Kingdom.\n\n"}
{"id": "48094464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48094464", "title": "Private timber reserve (Tasmania)", "text": "Private timber reserve (Tasmania)\n\nA private timber reserve is an area of privately owned land, used or intended to be used, for growing timber within the Australian state of Tasmania.\n\nLandowners can have their land declared as a Private Timber Reserve and protect their right to use private land to grow timber. Private land or freehold land refers to land registered under Torrens title. A landowner is the person(s) and/or legal entity registered on the Torrens Title.\n\nPrivate Timber Reserves are unique, with no other State in Australia, or internationally, providing the land owner with protection of their rights to use their planted land, land they intend to plant or native forests areas, to grow timber.\n\nGrowing timber is long term investment with trees often taking decades to grow to maturity. Forest and tree owners need certainty that they will be able to harvest in the future. Securing the right to use land to grow timber provides some certainty that the owner will be able to harvest in the future.\n\nIn the Australian State of New South Wales, landowners can apply to have timber plantations authorised as 'complying plantations' and have a guaranteed right to harvest... This guarantee is only extended to plantation, not native forests or land intended to be planted.\n\nPrivate Timber Reserve is land that has been declared as a Private Timber Reserve under Section 11 of the \"Forests Practices Act 1985\". The Act was passed by both Houses of the Tasmanian Government in 1985, and received Royal Assent 25 May 1985, with a commencement date of 2 November 1987 for Part II – Private Timber Reserves.\n\nLand declared as a Private Timber Reserve is \"used only for establishing forests, or growing or harvesting timber in accordance with the Forest Practices Code and such other activities which the Authority considers to be compatible with establishing forests, or growing or harvesting timber\". The activities considered to be compatible are; apiary sites, education and scientific purposes, grazing under well established trees, hunting, nature based recreation.\n\nThe declaration of the Private Timber Reserve is registered on the land title as per Section 15 of the \"Forests Practices Act 1985\". The declaration of the Private Timber Reserve remains with the title(s), despite changes in ownership, or until an application to revoke is submitted by the landowner and approved. A landowner can make an application to revoke all or part of the area declared as a Private Timber Reserve, at any time.\n\nA Private Timber Reserve is an area of land, used or intended to be used, for growing timber. It could be an area of native forest, plantation (exotic and native species) or land intended to be used to grow timber. The land has to be capable of growing timber. The minimum area that can be declared a Private Timber Reserve is five hectares.\n\nTimber means trunks and branches of trees, whether standing or not, and all wood. This definition includes the full range of wood products; all categories of saw logs, veneer logs, pulpwood and firewood.\n\nThere are 1,114,883 hectares of private land in Tasmania covered by forest or plantation (857,751 hectares of native forests and 257,132 hectares of plantation). As June 2014, 449,444 hectares were declared as Private Timber Reserve. This represents 40% of the area of private land covered native forests or plantation. The estimates for the area of private land covered by native forests or plantation, and areas declared as Private Timber Reserve may include areas not covered by trees. Such areas include; rocky areas, glades, firebreaks, roads, and swamps, and are found within boundaries of the forest or plantation owned by individual land owners. All estimates of forests area, and area of land declared as Private Timber Reserve, use a number of methodologies to calculate area.\n\nThe State of Tasmania has 3.706 million hectares of forests (3.362 million hectares of native forests, 0.331 million hectares of plantation and 0.33 million hectares of other forest) covering 54% of the State.\n\nThere are 27.1 million hectares of private forest in Australia (16% of forest area privately owned). Only 13.9% of the World's forest is privately owned.\n\nLocal planning schemes created under the \"Land Use Planning and Approval Act 1993\" can not be used to zone an area, declared as a Private Timber Reserve, to make timber growing a prohibited activity or place conditions on the activity. On land declared a Private Timber Reserve, local government authority development applications for operations, subject to an approved Forest Practices Plan, are not required.\n\nConsultation is still required under the Forest Practices Code with the local government authority when Forest Practices Plan \nare being prepared.\n\nThe process to declare an area a Private Timber Reserve is set out in the Part II of the \"Forest Practices Act 1985\".\n\nThe landowner completes an application form, and informs anyone who has an interest in the land or the trees as per Section 5 of the application. Landowners can declare any part or all their land a Private Timber Reserves.\n\nThe application is in two parts, Part A to be completed by the Applicant (landowner) and Part B, completed by a person authorised by the Forests Practices Authority Board. Part B of the Application requires details on vegetation cover, and on any natural or cultural values on the area. A Private Timber Reserve can only be declared over an area where forestry activity can be undertaken in accordance with the Forest Practices Code. \nPrivate Forests Tasmania assesses the application and makes a recommendation to the Board of the Forest Practices Authority that the Private Timber Reserve be granted, or not. Private Forest Tasmania has a delegation under the \"Forest Practices Act 1985\" – Part II PRIVATE TIMBER RESERVES, from the Board of the Forest Practices Authority to accept, assess and make recommendations on applications to declare and revoke land as private timber reserve\n\nThe declaration of the land as a Private Timber Reserve is registered on the land title, and can be declared over a whole title or over part of a title.\n\nApplication fees apply. Section 5 (2)(d) \"Forests Practices Act 1985\" requires that, \"an application to declare land as a private timber reserve must be accompanied by a fee\". Originally the cost per application was AUD$100 (prior to 1999) with a fee of AUD$350 introduced in 1999–2000. The fee increase followed an instruction from the Government that the fee should cover the costs of processing the application.\n\nThe application fee is subject to annual increase under the \"Fee Units Act 1997\". An application to declare land as a Private Timber Reserve attracts 350 fee units. In 2018–19, a fee unit value was set at AUD$1.58 per fee unit . Currently the fee is AUD$553 (July 2018) plus the cost of registering the declaration on the land title.\n\nThe Crown Solicitor charges a fee to register the Private Timber Reserve on the land title, AUD$104.50 (including GST) if a Private Timber Reserve covers only full titles, and an additional AUD$104.50 (including GST) if a Private Timber Reserve covers part of the land title listed in the application as well.\n\nSection 18(2)b of the \"Forest Practices Act 1985\" states that a forests practices plan is to \" contain, in the case of a private timber reserve, or where the owner of the land referred to in the plan wishes to restock the land with trees, specifications in connection with the restocking of the land with tree\".\n\nA forest practices plan can not be certified for an area declared as a Private Timber Reserve, unless the reforestation section of the plan contains restocking requirements.\n\nUnder the \"Land Tax Act 2000\" landowners in Tasmania are subject to annual land tax, based on land value.\n\nIf the land meets the definition of Primary Production Land or PPL classification applies to land as at 1 July in any year, then the owner of that land is not required to pay land tax for that land in that financial year. Land declared as a Private Timber Reserve under section 11 of the \"Forest Practices Act 1985\" and advertised in the Tasmanian Government Gazette is eligible for PPL classification and no land tax is payable.\n\nThe 'Report of the Board of Inquiry into Private Forestry Development in Tasmania 1977' recommended that;\n\"That statutory provisions be made for a 'dedication' scheme in relation to private land based broadly on the British scheme which has operated since 1947 and that direct financial assistance be provided by the Government within the framework of the scheme.\"\n\nThe Report authors recognised the need, and potential return to the industry and State, if assistance was provided to private forest owners. Such assistance was proposed to be provided to owner who had dedicated their land for forestry. Like the British scheme the aim was to encourage the proper management of native forests.\n\nThe Board also discussed the illogical distinctions drawn by finance companies between moneys available for clearing of forests and agriculture and for forestry. Investment funds for forestry were difficult to obtain. In summary, the need to secure investment in private forestry was recognised and the dedication of a private timber reserve was a key element to securing that investment, either from the government or the private sector.\n\nWhen the Bill for the \"Forest Practices Act\" was introduced into the Tasmanian Parliament in April 1985, the Minister for Forests, Robin Gray, referenced the Private Forestry Council recommendation to create the \"concept of private timber reserve\".\n\nOn the introduction of the \"Forest Practices Act 1985\" amendments were made to sections 756 and 759 of the now repealed.\n\nIn the \"Local Government Act 1962\" Section 756, provided local government with the power to terminate certain non-conforming uses under a planning scheme. If a use was terminated a landowner had to seek approval to use their land, even if the use of the land use had not changed. The \"Forest Practices Act 1985\" amendment meant land declared as Private Timber Reserve was one land use where the power to terminate non-conforming uses did not apply. The other uses, where the power to terminate non-conforming uses does not apply, were; the site of a dwelling house or land used for agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, pasture, or similar purpose.\n\nThe 1985 amendment of Section 758 of the \"Local Government Act 1962\", provided for the land declared as Private Timber Reserve to be treated as a lawful use of land. This meant that land used for forestry had same status as land used for agriculture.\n\nThese amendments were deemed necessary because the use of the land for forestry purposes is not obvious. It is relatively simple to recognise land used for housing and agriculture, and hence continuing use, because the land contains buildings or crops or livestock. The use of an area of forest, used for forestry purposes, is infrequent and the period between any activity may span decades.\n\nThere was a need to ensure that 'continuing use' be recognised was also addressed in the new planning Act \"Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993\" introduced in 1993.\n\nUnder the \"Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993\" on land: where use has stopped for 2 years or more periods; or which has stopped for 2 or more periods which together total 2 years in any period of 3 years; or in the case of a use which is seasonal in nature, if the use does not take place for 2 years in succession; is subject to the operation of a planning scheme or interim order.\n\nForestry has a pattern of land use where there is activity when planted or regenerated occurs, and then years later when thinning or harvesting occurs. It is often not apparent that in the period between planting/regeneration and any harvest, the land is being used to grow timber. The direct reference to Private Timber Reserves was necessary otherwise the pattern of use of land for forestry, could have resulted in the land being subject to planning schemes and interim orders, without the fact the land was being used for forestry, and had been for decades, being recognised.\n\nLand Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 requires local government authorities to create planning schemes and zone land for uses. Areas of land were zoned for forestry use as a permitted use. Other areas of land where forestry occurred, but not zoned with forestry as a permitted used, required a development permit from the local government authority. These development permits do not provide any certainty that the land owner would be able to harvest the wood grown. Permits are usually issued for native forest harvest and regeneration, or to establish a plantation, but did not explicitly create the right to harvest at a latter date.\n\nIn Section 20 (7) of the \"Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993\";\n\nSection 20(7) also applies to mineral exploration, fishing and marine farming operations. Forestry, mineral exploration, fishing and marine farming are not subject to the provisions of planning schemes.\n\nIt is possible for a landowner to apply for a Private Timber Reserve, where under a local planning scheme forestry is a use permitted or where a permit is required. A Private Timber Reserves cannot be declared over an area where forestry is prohibited.\n\nUnder Section 9 of the \"Forests Practices Act 1985\"\nan appeal can be made to the Forest Practices Tribunal against a refusal to grant, or the granting of a Private Timber Reserve. Twenty eight appeals were lodged with the Tribunal, 7 were upheld and 21 dismissed.\n\nIn two Appeals, the Appellant offered no proof to the Tribunal hearing. In five other appeals,\n\nThe Meander Valley Council appealed to the Tribunal on nine occasions, and was successful on only one appeal (TASPFT 10 1997). The nine appeals include two appeals where no proof was provided to the Tribunal. In these two appeals the Council appealed to the Tribunal but provided no proof or submission to the Tribunal to support their appeal.\n\nAn additional three Tribunal hearings were held to consider costs. In two cases, the Tribunal directed each party pay their own cost and in one case costs were awarded to the Respondents.\n\nThere have been a number of challenges to applications to declare areas as Private Timber Reserve lodged in the Tasmanian Supreme Court. \nAn application to declare an area a Private Timber Reserve was received in June 1997, and assessed as per the requirements the Act Section 8 (d) of the \"Forests Practices Act 1985\" which sets the grounds for granting or refusing and application. The local government authority, the Meander Valley Council lodged an objection to the application as provided in the Section 7 of the Act. Their ground for the objection was that forestry \"would not be in the public interest\" as allowed under Section 8 of the Act.\n\nThe Board of the Forest Practices Authority approved the application and the Meander Valley Council appealed the decision to the Forest Practices Tribunal under Section 9 of the Act. The Tribunal held a hearing on 13 October 1997, with the decision to dismiss the appeal delivered on 10 November 1997.\n\nOn 8 November 1997, the Meander Valley Planning Scheme 1995 came into effect and forestry become a prohibited activity on the land covered by the application. This meant on 8 November 1997, forestry was prohibited on the land and the decision of the Tribunal of 10 November was void. Under Section 8 (2) (d) of the Act refusal of an application is required if...\n\nThe planning scheme declaration on 8 November 1997 meant owner of the land was prohibited from establishing forests, or growing or harvesting timber, on the land.\n\nIn early February 1998, the Meander Valley Council registered an appeal against the decision of the Forest Practices Tribunal with the Tasmanian Supreme Court. The Crown did not contest the appeal as establishing forests, or growing or harvesting timber was prohibited on the land under the local planning scheme at 8 November 1997, two days before the Tribunal decision.\n\nJustice Crawford on 16 March 1998 (M1 of 1998) concluded applications must be refused where forestry is a discretionary use and no permit has been issued, in addition to situations where forestry is prohibited use. The effect of this conclusion was that areas of land declared a Private Timber Reserve, where a permit was required to undertake forestry under a local planning scheme, \"may now be held to be legally invalid\".\n\nIn June 1997, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust sought legal advice as to the implications of Justice Crawford's judgement. Their advice maintained that where a permit for forestry use is required under a planning scheme, and has not been obtained before the land was declared a Private Timber Reserve, the declaration of the private timber reserve was illegal.\n\nThe Board of Forest Practices Authority provided a brief statement on the issue for affected people. Private Forests Tasmania sent a letters to approximately 540 holders of Private Timber Reserves that may be affected, and all 149 current applicants (as at June 1997). All local government authorities were also informed of the position.\n\nIn July 1997, the Government announced it would pass legislation to validate private timber reserves (media release 15 July). The Opposition also expressed support for the proposal to validate private timber reserves.\n\nThe Tasmanian Conservation Trust applied to the Resource Management and Planning Appeal Tribunal on 8 September 1997, seeking to have all Private Timber Reserves declared after the introduction of the \"Land Use Planning and Approval Act 1993\" to be revoked. Parties to the application were the Forest Practices Authority and Private Forests Tasmania, as respondents. A hearing was held 18 September 1997, when it was argued, and accepted, that land owners whose land had been declared as private timber reserve, post the introduction of the \"Land Use Planning and Approval Act 1993\", should be informed of the proceedings. Private Forests Tasmania identified the land owners who could be affected by the Tribunal's decisions. A total of 980 applications, covering some 320,000 hectares, have been accepted to date (1997); with some 540 applications, involving 383 landowners, affected by any decision to revoke Private Timber Reserves approved after the introduction of \"Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993\".\n\nIf successful, the Trust's application could have resulted in the majority all Private Timber Reserves, approved after the introduction of \"Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993\" (9 November 1993) to be revoked. Some landowners may have had local government approval to undertake forestry activities prior to applying for a Private Timber Reserve, and hence would not be revoked. Of immediate concern was that Timber Harvesting Plans for areas declared as Private Timber Reserves, may be invalid, and may need local government planning permission. Any harvesting underway on Private Timber Reserves at the time, without planning permission, would have in breach of the provisions of the \"Land Use Planning and Approval Act 1993\".\n\nAn amendment was made to \"Forest Practices Act 1985\" whereby a requirement to obtain a permit to undertake forestry activities under the \"Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993\" was deemed not to be a prohibition under Section 8 2(A) of the \"Forest Practices Act 1985\".\n\nIn June 1999, Royal assent was given to the \"Forest Practices (Private Timber Reserves Validation) Act 1999\". This Act validated Private Timber Reserves already declared.\n\nAn appeal against the approval of a Private Timber Applications from EE & IC Porter resulted in a hearing that heard evidence for 17 days. There were six appellants Meander Valley Council, J & M Hawkes, N Hoofman, PA Elkin, J Lies, J King; The appellants were all \"prescribed persons\" under the \"Forest Practices Act\" Section 7(4) with three respondents; EE & IC Porter (landowners who submitted the application, and the Forests Practices Authority who approved the application. Other parties provided submissions to the appeal: Private Forests Tasmania, the Authority accepting and assessing the application; Gunns Ltd, a forestry company purchasing the wood from the landowner; The Environment Association, a local conservation group and Mr Lockhart, a local resident.\n\nThe Tribunal received 12 submissions in writing. These submissions often included expert advice and opinion from other parties. Each submission was then reviewed by all Appellants and Respondents, and submissions in reply lodged. In some cases, additional expert advice was included. During the hearing each party was then able cross examine witness, in particular expert witnesses, giving evidence. As result, in addition to the authors of the submissions from the Appellants and Respondents (12 persons), 17 persons were subject to cross examination.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the Forest Practices Authority to approve the application.\n\nDuring the hearing the appellants sought to have the decision of the Forest Practice Authority quashed because the application form for the Private Timber Reserve was not complete. The Tribunal found this did not invalidate the application. The application process was changed by the Private Forests Tasmania, in conjunction with Forests Practices Authority, in 2006, and a two part application form was authorised. \nThis hearing is notable due to its length, and the extensive cross examination of witnesses. The Tribunal found:\n\nAn appellant, Mr King appealed the decision of the Tribunal to the Supreme Court pursuant to the \"Judicial Review Act 2000\". Justice Blow Alan Blow concluded that \"No error of law on the part of the Tribunal\", and dismissed the appeal.\n\nMr King then lodged an appeal with the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, where Chief Justice Underwood and Justices Slicer and Tennent unanimously dismissed his appeal.\n\n"}

It is based in Germany and currently can be viewed via French, German, and Austrian cable as well as over the internet through the website's livestream and in certain public locations.\n\nA catalog of over 3000 videos of art, experimental films, contemporary dance videos, avante garde music videos, and films of photographs are in constant motion within the channel earning it the nickname as \"The MTV of Contemporary Art\".\n\nClose to the ideas of Nam June Paik and Brian Eno, the concept for the channel was first presented at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1998 and at the Venice Biennale in 1999 by Marcus Kreiss. In 2006, SFE received the license to broadcast in Germany and the channel officially went on air that year. In 2008, the channel started airing in France via Iliad (company) and in 2014 the channel started broadcasting via Austrian cable through Kabel Austria and A One.\n\nIn 2009, SFE acquired a permanent installation at Palais de Tokyo and, in 2010, the channel became a residing fixture in all German airports. In 2011, the SFE was invited by the French Institute to present the channel at the Nam June Paik Center in Seoul, South Korea and while there put a show together to be viewed in Central Station on the largest LED screen in the world.\n\nIn 2007, the channel's staff added Alec Crichton, a curator from the Academy of Media Arts Cologne to manage the incoming submissions from international artists for the channel's broadcast. In 2012, Markus Kienast, a telco engineer, created the livestream and aided the station's programming software and international development while Wolfgang Kabisch, a cultural journalist, became the editor-in-chief of the channel's cultural output in 2013. In 2014, glamour girl Melissa Mourer Ordener joined the team as the official muse.\n\nSFE is an alternative approach to television and is referred to as \"anti-television\" or \"the MTV of contemporary art\". The content is submitted by artists around the world and then curated into constantly changing broadcasts. The channel has no broadcast schedule and is constantly bringing in new content, so each viewing experience is completely unique and unpredictable.\n\nSFE programming is largely non-verbal due to the nature of video art and can be understood no matter what language the viewer speaks. SFE plans for this to appeal to a broader international audience and is the first international art channel thanks to the lack of a language barrier. The online livestream broadcasts the same content around the world so everyone is always watching the same content in real time.\n\nThe channel also gives universities the opportunity to have their own broadcast time so students can showcase their own work on the same platform as other renowned artists, such as Tom Sachs, James Turrell, Bill Viola, and Mike Kilo. In these cases, the broadcasts adopt the title \"Souvenirs from ________ \" (ex. Souvenirs from Mars is the name of the broadcast from The University of Marseille).\n\nA large portion of the broadcast is allotted to externally curated programs, often provided by young, up and coming curators, or to Carte Blanche special formats for artists (Iris Brosch, Tom Sachs…) or institutions (Art Cologne, Centre Georges Pompidou.)\n\nSFE expands the idea of television, giving it opportunities to be viewed both actively and passively as \"video paintings\" through the integration with public spaces.\n\nThe channel refuses to have advertisements broadcast on the channel in order to maintain the integrity of the art space and viewing experience. Companies looking to have their name on the channel have the option of making an art video that can be seamlessly integrated in to the programs or the station can air an \"anti-commercial\" in which the station broadcasts a solid color field with the name of the company in it for 30 seconds.\n\nNotable clients who have advertised using the channel include:\n\nSFE distributes its programming continusously:\n\n\nThe logo for SFE is inspired by In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust. In the book, there is a scene in which Proust recalls sitting in his garden and having a moment of total recall triggered by the taste of the madeleine (cake) he was soaking in his tea. Proust's writing focused on memories and the idea that our memory affects our perception of reality and SFE incorporated this iconic madeline to symbolize the artistic process in which we transform our reality. The basis of the channel is a collective memory of moments which are the created reality of the artist behind the screen. The graphic design of the madeline also recalls the icon for Star Trek and the futuristic concept of \"video paintings\" which were originally inspired by science fiction set designers.\n\n\n"}

The next year, XM pulled the PCR's from the market, reportedly due to music piracy. However, that didn't stop demand: Some units were reportedly selling for more than US$300 on eBay. As of February 2007, prices settled down to around US$30–50.\n\nSeveral enhancements have been created for the PCR, both software and hardware. In the software arena, PCR Replacement programs have been sprouting up on Internet forums and web sites. These are software packages that replace the interface included with the PCR, XMMT. Several features have been added to these new programs, including the ability to rip songs and build an MP3 library, time shift shows so that the user can listen at a more convenient time, control the radio via a web browser, and stream audio to other computers. Some web sites also offer a playlist log, which allows a user to browse a list of all the recently played songs or shows.\n\nA hardware modification has also been discovered that allows the addition of a TOSLINK optical output, allowing users to connect the PCR to the optical digital input on a home theater receiver.\n\nThe XM Direct receiver, also marketed as the XM Commander, can now serve the same purpose as the PCR. While the XM Direct is intended for automotive use, the unit itself is controlled by RS-232 command signals, and so is easily adapted to PC control. When combined with a \"smart cable\", which is really just a USB to Serial cable and a wiring adapter to connect to the XM Direct's control port, the XM Direct supports some features not found on the original PCR.\n\nThe XM Mini tuner may also hold promise for hardware tweakers.

Unlike the Direct, the Mini is also capable of receiving XM's newest technologies, including HD audio.\n"}
