The total area of agricultural land exceeds 6.12 million hectares. Agricultural production is most prominent in Northern Serbia on the fertile Pannonian Plain, and the southern lowlands adjacent to the Sava, Danube and Great Morava rivers. There has been in a sharp decline in agricultural activity since 1948, when almost three-quarters of the population engaged in farming, to the present one-quarter.\n\nSerbia produces various agricultural products, mostly grains, fruits and vegetables which constitute a significant part of its GDP and exports. Serbia is number two producer of raspberries (84,299 tons, second to Russia) and plums (146,776 tons, second to China) in the world, it is also significant producer of maize (6,158,120 tons, ranked 32nd in the world) and wheat (2,095,400 tons, ranked 35th in the world). The production of sugar beet (2,299,770 tons) and sunflower seeds (454,282 tons) meets domestic demand for sugar and vegetable oil and permits export of some 180,000 tons of sugar to the European Union.\n\nFruit farms cover over 310,000 hectares of arable land in Serbia.\n\nFruit production volume in tons (as of2012):\n\nSerbia is the 19th largest producer of wine in the world. The country has one of Europe's longest history of viticulture and belongs chronologically to the Old World wine producing countries.\n\nThere are nearly 70,000 hectares of vineyards in Serbia, producing about 425,000 tons of grapes annually, which position Serbia among the first 20 wine producing countries in the world. The majority of production is dedicated to local wineries.\n\nMajor varieties include the Belgrade Seedless, Prokupac, Sauvignon, \"Italian Riesling\", Cabernet, Chardonnay, White and Red Burgundy, Hamburg, Muscat, Afus Ali, Vranac, Tamjanika, Krstac, Smederevka, and Dinka.\n\nThere are several faculties that offer tertiary education of agriculture to students:\nThere are several scientific institutes with scope of their activities devoted to the development of agriculture:\n\n"}

The Bell Media outlet operates at 98.5 MHz FM with an effective radiated power of 100 kW from a transmitter located at the intersection of Old Banff Coach Road and 85 Street Southwest, and studio located at CTV studios on Patina Rise.\n\nCIBK is currently ranked #6 according to the Fall 2014 PPM Data report released by BBM Canada.\n\nThe station received approval by the CRTC in 2001. When CIBK made its debut on September 6, 2002 as \"Vibe 98.5\", they thought they would become the city's first R&B/hip hop outlet, but they were beaten to the punch by CKIS (KISS 96.9) by about a month. This would spark a format war in Calgary, with both stations making potshots at one another. On April 1, 2003, CKIS would bail out and abruptly change to the Jack FM format, leaving CIBK as the victor.\n\nHowever, CIBK would also go through an evolution of its own as they transitioned to a rhythmic contemporary direction by 2003, and to their current mainstream top 40 direction by 2004. CIBK still played R&B/hip hop product (although at a reduced rate), and also incorporated pop and dance into the mix, in part due to its license with the CRTC that now requires the station to be programmed as a CHR outlet. Because CIBK was anticipated for years prior to its launch to be Calgary's long-awaited urban station, it had faced much criticism for bailing out to a Top 40 format leaving many of the station's hip-hop/R&B fans disappointed and let down by Standard.\n\nCIBK was part of the acquisition of most of the assets of Standard Broadcasting by Astral Media that was completed on October 29, 2007. Under Astral, CIBK dropped the rhythmic lean.\n\nOn April 1, 2010, Astral Media registered the domain names, VirginRadio985.com, Virgin985.com and VirginCalgary.com, which many speculated would be a branding change for CIBK to become a part of the \"Virgin Radio\" branding in Canada. This was confirmed on the Vibe Morning Show's June 23, 2010 broadcast, and the rebranding took place on June 30 at Noon, and will retain its Top 40 format. It is the second Virgin Radio station with a mainstream top 40 format after Toronto's CKFM. The last song to be played on \"Vibe\" was \"Goodbye\" by Kristinia DeBarge, while the first song on \"Virgin Radio\" was \"California Gurls\" by Katy Perry.\n\nCIBK-FM is the longest-tenured CHR station in Alberta still having the format today, only Edmonton's CKNG-FM (now adult hits since 2004) had the longest-tenured format from 1991-2003.\n\nAs part of the merger of Astral and Bell Media approved by the CRTC on June 27, 2013, CIBK is now owned by Bell Media.\n\nLike most other Canada's Virgin Radio stations, CIBK brands itself as broadcasting \"the most hit music\" with 40 minutes of commercial free hit music each hour and it also broadcasts the extended version of this kind between 4:25 and 5:55 PM weekdays.\n\n"}

Through the development of research programmes, regular publications and the organisation of international meetings, The Geneva Association aims to enhance the understanding of risk and insurance matters and acts as an information creator and disseminator. It acts as the voice of the largest insurance groups worldwide in the dialogue with international institutions. In parallel, it advances—in economic and cultural terms—the development and application of risk management and the understanding of uncertainty in the modern economy.\n\nIn this role, it is primarily concerned with studying climate risk and the role insurance can play in disaster risk reduction; the rising costs related to ageing populations, either in long-term care, age-related illnesses such as dementia, or retirement funding; liability concerns; and the issue of financial stability in insurance and the development of an efficient regulatory framework.\n\nEstablished in 1973, The Geneva Association, officially the “International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics”, is based in Zurich, Switzerland and is a non-profit organisation funded by its members.\n\nThe Geneva Association membership comprises a statutory maximum of 90 chief executive officers (CEOs) from the world’s top insurance and reinsurance companies. It organises international expert networks and manages discussion platforms for senior insurance executives and specialists as well as policy-makers, regulators and multilateral organisations. The Chairman of The Geneva Association is currently Mike McGavick, CEO of XL Catlin.\n\nThe general secretariat handles the daily operations of the association. Its work is directed by the secretary general, and the deputy secretary general and head of insight. Currently these positions are held respectively by Anna Maria D'Hulster and Antoine Baronnet.\n\nAll of The Geneva Association's activities are pursued by means of research, publications and the organisation of international conferences. In addition, The Geneva Association organises international expert networks and manages discussion platforms for senior insurance executives and specialists as well as policy-makers, regulators, academics and international organisations. The Geneva Association’s annual General Assembly is the most prestigious gathering of leading insurance CEOs worldwide. Speakers at The Geneva Association’s seminars have included Nobel Prize winners such as Kenneth J. Arrow, Josef Stiglitz, as well as important figures of the political and economic arena such as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair; head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde; former U.S. Vice President Al Gore; Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne; and Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the FSB, Mark Carney.\n\nThe Geneva Association was founded under the initiative of a committee which met for the first time in Paris on 22 September 1971. This founding committee was constituted by the following people:\n\n\nThe constitutive assembly of The Geneva Association took place in Paris on 27 February 1973, at the headquarters of La Paternelle (today part of the AXA Group). The following companies were represented by their president or CEO: Allianz, Münchener Rück, Aachener & Münchener, and Victoria for \"Germany\"; Commercial Union, Royal and Mercantile & General for \"the United Kingdom\"; Erste Allgemeine for \"Austria\"; Royale Belge for \"Belgium\"; UAP, AGF, Paternelle, Préservatrice and SAFR for \"France\"; Generali, RAS, Reale Mutua, INA and Fondiaria for \"Italy\"; Nationale Nederlanden for \"the Netherlands\", and Swiss Re for \"Switzerland\".\n\nThe first president of The Geneva Association was , French prime minister from 1976 to 1981.\n\nThe Geneva Association was established for the purpose of promoting economic research in the sector of risk and insurance.\n\nFormer Presidents of The Geneva Association:\n\nFormer Secretaries General of The Geneva Association:\n\nToday, The Geneva Association has members from 28 countries around the world. Its members are the chief executive officers of the largest insurance companies in the world, and they are members in a personal capacity. The statutory limit to the number of members is 90. Applications of new members are examined by the board of directors at the proposal of the chairman and, if recommended, are submitted to the general assembly for approval by majority vote.\n\nAfter the financial crisis erupted in 2008, The Geneva Association set up a special working group specifically to analyse the relationship between systemic risk, financial stability and insurance. The association has since published ten reports, studies or articles on various aspects of financial stability and regulation in insurance, including the identification of systemic risk, designation methodology, surrenders, insurance and resolution, variable annuities, and global capital standards.\n\nThrough both the Insurance and Finance and PROGRES programmes of The Geneva Association, there has been an ongoing dialogue with the IAIS and other supervisory bodies. In the discussions on systemic risk regulation however, a multitude of organisations such as the G-20, the IMF, the OECD to name but a few, have become involved and influential in the setting of new insurance systemic risk regulations. As a result, the association has broadened its discussions and on several occasions, has engaged these other organisations directly in the form of open letters or comments to address points made.\n\nIn May 2008, following a mandate from its members at the 2008 General Assembly, The Geneva Association began its Climate Change and Insurance (CC+I) research project in response to one of the most multi-faceted challenges to the insurance industry since its inception.\n\nOn 6 September 2010, The Geneva Association and three other initiatives (ClimateWise, MCII and UNEP-FI) launched a joint statement that calls on governments worldwide to harness risk management techniques and insurance expertise to help implement climate change adaptation measures in the developing world. In the context of the increasing economic and human costs of climate change in the developing world, the statement seeks to highlight how governments can unlock significant potential to increase the protection and reduce the vulnerability of developing world populations and economies.\n\n“The insurance industry is uniquely positioned to provide specialised services for countries and businesses facing climate risks worldwide. Insurers have the expertise to develop a broad range of affordable private insurance solutions for climate risks. Insurance mechanisms are an effective tool to promote climate related risk management and reduction; The Geneva Association recognises that no stakeholder can succeed alone in solving the challenges of climate change. Insurance can and should be a strong complementary mechanism in a wider framework of adaptation.”\n\nIn 2011, the name of the project was changed to Climate Risk and Insurance (CR+I). The objectives of the climate-linked research are to identify and analyse:\n\nTo this end, The Geneva Association has issued several reports and studies on climate risk and disaster reduction, such as a review of 2011 marked in particular by the tsunami in Japan and, most recently, a study on the warming of the oceans.\n\nThe Climate Risk Statement\nOn 20 May 2014, following The Geneva Association's 41st General Assembly in Toronto, 67 chief executives of the world’s leading insurers confirmed their commitment to The Geneva Association’s Climate Risk Statement – a set of guiding principles on the substantial role insurance can play in global efforts to tackle climate-related risks. The statement provides the foundations on which the direction of future climate-related initiatives by The Geneva Association will be based.\n\nThis statement confirms the Kyoto Statement signed in 2009, with additional signatures and reflecting the latest scientific evidence. Michael Butt, chairman of AXIS Capital and co-chair of the Climate Risk and Insurance working group, said: \"The Climate Risk Statement Provides a reference point for policymakers, non-governmental organisations, customers, as well as the insurance industry itself, on the ways in which insurance can complement global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Our industry can make a considerable contribution to global efforts to reduce the impact of climate change, but reaching its full potential will require greater collaboration with governments and global governance bodies such as the United Nations.\"\n\nThe Statement received the full support of former U.S. Vice-President Al Gore, who spoke at The Geneva Association's General Assembly in Toronto: \"The insurance industry has long ago taken the initiative on climate risk, and with this statement commits to do even more. As an industry it has the capacity to work with policymakers on the mitigation of climate-related risks. If market forces are leveraged and elected officials and regulators are engaged wisely, insurers have so much to offer, and can help the world deal with this serious issue. Most people don't want to think about long-term risk. Now that our world is facing the gravest risks it has ever faced, the world should turn to insurers for advice. In turn, insurers must be more vocal about the challenges they see.\"\n\nThe cost of pensions and retirement policy challenges are among the key issues in policy responses to the European sovereign debt crisis since 2010. The challenge of financing retirement is largely due to improved longevity and lower fertility rates that are not properly represented in the cost of retirement. Adding to this concern about how to support a growing number of pensions living longer lives is the increase in age-related illnesses such as dementia, and the health-care costs of an ageing population.\n\nThe Geneva Association has been studying these issues through its Life and Pensions and Health and Ageing programmes for many years proposing solutions to the challenges they raise that are now more urgently needed than ever.\n\nThe Public Pensions Crisis in the U.S.\n\nOn 3 December 2013, Detroit became the largest city in the U.S. to become legally eligible for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. Its ballooning deficits and large pension shortfall are not an isolated case, however. Across the country, states have posted funding shortfalls or more than a trillion dollars.\n\nIn its report on this crisis, The Geneva Association examines the issues at the root of this crisis and suggests that the non-payment of annual required contributions and an unbalanced structure to pension planning are among the most significant challenges to overcome.\n\n\"Executive summary of the report\"\n\n• A 2010 report by the Pew Center on the States highlights the trillion-dollar shortfall facing state and local retirement systems in the U.S. due to policy choices and a lack of fiscal discipline, namely the failure to make annual payments for pensions systems at actuarially recommended levels and expanding benefits without considering their long-term costs. The majority of states (34) have a funding level below 80 per cent.\n\n• The Geneva Association has long advocated a four-pillar approach to sound pension planning: (1) a universal public system such as Social Security, (2) an occupational pensions system supported by employers under government financial supervision, (3) private savings using financial intermediaries and (4) continued employment, through the removal of barriers to partial employment of retirees.\n\n• Excessive reliance on one of the four pillars—particularly a public system or private savings only—strains public finances and/or an individual’s ability to finance retirement adequately. The Geneva Association has also highlighted the unnecessary losses of human capital resulting from restrictions on the employment of retirees. Human capital, i.e. the ability to earn income, should be valued, particularly in societies with ageing populations.\n\n• The Geneva Association calls for more in-depth study of solutions to the pension crisis the U.S.\n\nTo achieve its main goals, The Geneva Association organises or co-organises a number of meetings, seminars and conferences. The most important meeting of The Geneva Association is its general assembly that takes place every year. At this occasion, key economic issues are discussed by members, the CEOs of the world’s leading insurers, special observers including regulators and guest speakers from inside and outside the industry. In 2010, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, provided a keynote speech. Stemming from General Assemblies, as of 2010, The Geneva Association produces General Assembly Reviews, giving a hindsight view of discussions and presentations having taken place at the meeting. The Geneva Association regularly organises international conferences which are linked to its research programmes.\n\nIn its role of promoting research in risks and insurance economics, The Geneva Association also awards a series of prizes and research grants every year. It also awards two research grants for submissions, usually in the form of a doctoral thesis, carried out in the field of risk and insurance economics.\nSubsidies of up to CHF 3,000 are also granted to authors of university theses on risk and insurance economics to help defray printing costs and to support the publication of high quality work.\n\nThe Geneva Association / IIS Research Awards\nThe Geneva Association and the International Insurance Society (IIS) have joined in a programme with business leaders in insurance to sponsor applied research in the insurance area. The purpose of the research programme is to create original, practically oriented research which addresses current business issues and problems of concern to senior insurance executives around the world. The programme is designed to fulfill a need of business to investigate subjects which directly influence daily business operations and operational business concerns or issues on a practical level.\nResearchers present the research selected to business executives at the yearly meeting of the International Insurance Society. The research is published and distributed by both the IIS and The Geneva Association in a special edition of \"The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance—Issues and Practice\". Research Awards for the best-qualified papers are presented in an amount up to $10,000.\n\nThe Ernst-Meyer Prize\nThe Geneva Association awards every year the prestigious Ernst-Meyer Prize for university research work, usually in the form of a doctoral thesis, which makes a significant and original contribution to the study of risk and insurance economics.\n\nResearch Grants\nEvery year, the association offers two grants for research into risk and insurance economics, on various subjects in economic theory and practice.\n\nThe Geneva Association publications take six different forms in addressing its various audiences: \n\nThe Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance—Issues and Practice\nFounded in 1976 and published quarterly by Palgrave, \"The Geneva Papers\" publish papers which both improve the scientific knowledge of the insurance industry and stimulate constructive dialogue between the industry and its economic and social partners. It is essential reading for insurance academics and researchers, insurance industry executives and other professionals who are searching for a deeper insight into the strategic options for their sector. It bridges the gap between these groups, highlighting overlapping areas of interest and providing mutually beneficial research and dialogue.\n\nThe Geneva Risk and Insurance Review\ntargets academics and university scholars in economics. The Review is published by Palgrave Macmillan in annual volumes of two issues. Its purpose is to support and encourage research in the economics of risk, uncertainty, insurance and related institutions by providing a forum for the scholarly exchange of findings and opinions.\n\nResearch reports, presentations and white papers \nThe Geneva Association publishes research on key issues such as financial stability and climate risk (e.g. ocean warming). It issues presentations in support of its research (e.g. a cross-industry benchmark study comparing the 28 banks designed as 'global systemically important' and 28 of the largest global insurers), while white papers are intended primarily to respond to draft policy papers presented for public consultation by regulatory bodies.\n\nThe Geneva Reports \nSeries tackles issues of strategic importance to the insurance industry that warrant special attention and particular analysis. The series is published on an “as appropriate basis” and is available both in printed and electronic versions. Topics covered have included the effects of climate change, disaster risk reduction, global ageing and retirement funding, and the credit crisis.\n\nNewsletters \nSeven newsletters on the main research activities, as well as on World Fire Statistics, are published throughout the year. They are published biannually, except for Insurance and Finance and the World Fire Statistics. They are disseminated in hard copy and in the form of e-newsletters.\n\nConference Papers \nThese are the working paper series of The Geneva Association. These documents present intermediary or final results of conference proceedings, special reports and research done by The Geneva Association. Most of these documents are available freely on The Geneva Association’s virtual library, except for those in restricted use, which remain in the private area.\nThe Geneva Association Working Paper Series \"Etudes et Dossiers\" appear at irregular intervals about 10-12 times per year. Distribution is limited. Hard copies are automatically sent to all of The Geneva Association’s members.\n\nBooks\nThe Geneva Association publishes books in relation with its research programmes, such as reports on systemic risk and insurance, inter alia the seminal report on \"Systemic Risk in Insurance - An analysis of insurance and financial stability\" published in March 2010, and the book \"The Performance Economy\" republished end of 2010. All information on Geneva Association publications are available online.\n\n"}

Accordingly, the villagers laid traps for the monster all around their homes and fields. The wounded monster was forced back into the mountains and the village was peaceful again for a while, but soon afterward it reappeared.

It tells the story of four young men (Mustapha, Lakhdar, Rachid, Mourad) who fall in love with Nedjma, daughter of an Algerian and a French woman, during the French colonization of Algeria. It is set in the east of Algeria, with most of the action taking place in the region around Constantine and Annaba (referred to by its French name, Bône, in the text).\n\nAlthough published in 1956, thus during the Algerian War of Independence which began in November 1954, it was largely written between 1947 and 1953, and the novel's political dimension applies specifically to this period rather than to the war itself. The central action of the novel takes place during the period following the nationalist demonstrations of 8 May 1945, which included the Sétif massacre. Two of the characters in the novel, Lakhdar and Mustapha, were arrested, imprisoned and tortured following these demonstrations. The novel begins in the wake of the period of upheavals which followed the demonstrations. The four male characters have found work on a building site, and one of them, Lakhdar, has been imprisoned following an altercation with M. Ernest, their (French) boss - an altercation which, however, due to the complex temporal structure of the novel, will not be related until later in the text. Shortly after this, still in the first part of the novel, another of the characters, Mourad, is involved in a brawl at a wedding which results in his being responsible for the death of M. Ricard, another French entrepreneur. This event causes the other characters to disperse, and from this point the novel changes in style and begins to recount their separate histories, jumping around considerably in its chronology. Each of the four male characters has a connection to, and is attracted to, Nedjma, who is the same age as the male characters but already (unhappily) married. Although based on a real person, with whom Yacine had a relationship, Nedjma (who rarely speaks in the novel and whose character is not developed) has frequently been identified with Algeria, \"la femme-patrie\". The novel also evokes the history of the characters' tribe, the Keblout, and of Abdelkader's original resistance to French colonisation.\n\nLargely eschewing a simple 'realist' style, and written in a highly sophisticated French which at times passes into poetry, Nedjma has been compared stylistically with contemporary French works of the Nouveau Roman period, although Charles Bonn notes that William Faulkner was a much greater influence on Yacine than any of the Nouveau Roman writers. It has also been read as a response to Albert Camus' famous novel L'Etranger which centres on the apparently irrational murder of an Algerian Arab by a French Pied-Noir.\n"}

Linklater set the record for the fastest flight between the islands at 53 seconds.\n\nMany students and their teachers take these flights to study the 60 archaeological sites on Papa Westray, making up the majority of passengers. Occasionally health professionals are needed to assist one of the island's 90 residents, and patients will also take the flight from Papa Westray to medical facilities when needed. The flight has also become popular among tourists.\n\nLoganair operates this flight with one of its two Pilatus Britten-Norman BN2B-26 Islander aircraft. The Islander is a high-wing, twin piston engine, propeller-driven aircraft. It is flown by a single pilot, and there is seating for eight passengers in the passenger cabin. One additional seat usually remains empty next to the pilot.\n\nLoganair's chief executive, Jim Cameron, described the Islander as \"robust\" and \"well suited to the vagaries of Scottish weather\". Summarizing expert opinion of the Islander, Alastair Dalton of \"The Scotsman\" said the aircraft \"had a good safety record and had proved versatile in operating from the shortest and roughest Highland runways\".\n\nLoganair is planning to introduce electric aircraft to the Orkney Islands by 2021 due to the short distance between the islands that would make such flights possible.\n\nThe flight numbers change daily and repeat with a weekly cycle. Loganair Flight 312 departs from Westray Airport to Papa Westray Airport on Monday morning, and Flight 317 returns to Westray that afternoon. On Tuesdays through Fridays, the flight numbers to Papa Westray are 323, 333, 343, and 353. The return flight numbers are 328, 338, 348, and 358. Flight 362 or 363 is the Saturday flight from Westray to Papa Westray, and on Sundays, Flight 378 is the return flight to Westray.\n\nIn 2014 Orkney Islands Council began consultations to build a number of fixed links between seven of the Orkney Islands. This would include a bridge between Westray and Papa Westray.\n\nThere are car ferries between the islands also, usually 13 daily departures per direction. They are around 5 km and last around 25 minutes.\n\n"}

As its name indicates, it was the main market bath for the local neighbourhood. Its layout follows the typical three-part procession from cold to warm found in Ottoman and Roman baths. The bath underwent a restoration in 2000–2001 and continues to be open to the public.\n"}

It is an endangered cattle breed.\n\nThe Évolène is a medium-sized, black pied or red pied breed, used more for beef production than milk production. Similar to the Herens, the Évolènes have a milk production of about 3,200 kg milk per year. Its fat content is about 3.8%. The breed is adapted to mountain pasture. \n\nSimilar to Pinzgau Cattle, the white parts of the fur are mostly on the back and the abdomen. The cattle are very muscular, with noticeable neck muscles in the females. Évolènes have short, strong legs and a short, broad head. The horns are very strong and exceptionally long. The height of bulls is about 130 cm, the weight 600 to 700 kg. Cows are smaller; they are only 115 to 125 cm high and weigh between 400 and 500 kg. \n\nSimilar to the Tux Cattle and the Herens, Évolène females are very aggressive, with cows fighting for their ranking in very long fights.\n"}
