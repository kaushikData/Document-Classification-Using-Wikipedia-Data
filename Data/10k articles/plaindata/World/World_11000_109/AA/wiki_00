Dusina describes the chapel lacking in necessarily means to celebrate the mass.\n\nYears later, in 1873, as the population of Qormi increased, a builder named Michelangelo Azzopardi proposed to the Bishop of Malta plans to build a bigger church instead of the old chapel. In 1880 work commenced on the building of the new church which was blessed by the Vicar General Guzeppi Mercieca on March 9, 1890.\n\nOn July 19, 1918, Archbishop Mauro Caruana made the church a subsidiary parish church, meaning that the church had the duty to minister to the surrounding people as a parish church under the authority the main parish church of St George. The church of St Sebastian eventually became an independent parish on 25 October 1935.\n\nIn 1937 new plans were made to build a larger church to serve as the parish church. Plans were made to acquire land nearby from the government which was granted a year later. In 1939, the designs for the new church were made by Arthur Zammit and presented by Annetto Mifsud Ellul. On February 4, 1940 the first work commenced on the building of the new church. The cornerstone was laid on 27 January 1946 by Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi. The crypt of the church was completed by 1952 and was blessed that same year were services commenced. In 1956 work on the building of the church was halted due to lack of funds.

{"id": "3054440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3054440", "title": "Flight airspeed record", "text": "Flight airspeed record\n\nAn air speed record is the highest airspeed attained by an aircraft of a particular class. The rules for all official aviation records are defined by Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), which also ratifies any claims. Speed records are divided into multiple classes with sub-divisions. There are three classes of aircraft: landplanes, seaplanes, and amphibians; then within these classes, there are records for aircraft in a number of weight categories. There are still further sub-divisions for piston-engined, turbojet, turboprop, and rocket-engined aircraft. Within each of these groups, records are defined for speed over a straight course and for closed circuits of various sizes carrying various payloads.\n\nRecords in \"gray\" font color are unofficial, including unconfirmed or unpublicized (wartime) secrets.\n\nThe Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird holds the official Air Speed Record for a manned airbreathing jet aircraft with a speed of 3,530 km/h (2,193 mph). It was capable of taking off and landing unassisted on conventional runways. The record was set on 28 July 1976 by Eldon W. Joersz and George T. Morgan Jr. near Beale Air Force Base, California, USA. SR-71 pilot Brian Shul reported in \"The Untouchables\" that he flew in excess of Mach 3.5 on 15 April 1986, over Libya, in order to avoid a missile.\n\nAlthough the official record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane in level flight is held by a Grumman F8F Bearcat, the \"Rare Bear\", with a speed of 528.31 mph (850.24 km/h), the unofficial record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane in level flight is held by a British Hawker Sea Fury at 547 mph (880 km/h). Whereas these were both demilitarised, modified fighters, the fastest piston-engined aeroplane in stock (original, factory-built) condition was the German Dornier Do 335 Pfeil, with a maximum speed of 474 mph (765 km/h) in level flight. The unofficial record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane (not in level flight) is held by a Supermarine Spitfire Mk XIX, which was calculated to have achieved a speed of 690 mph (1,110 km/h, Mach 0.96) in a dive on 5 February 1952.\n\nThe last new speed record ratified before the outbreak of World War II was set on 26 April 1939 with a Me 209 V1, at 755 km/h (469 mph). The chaos, and secrecy, of World War II meant that new speed breakthroughs were not publicized nor ratified. In October 1941, an unofficial speed record of 1004 km/h (624 mph) was secretly set by a Messerschmitt Me 163 AV4 rocket aircraft. Continued research during the war extended the secret, unofficial speed record to 1130 km/h (702 mph) by July 1944, achieved by a Messerschmitt Me 163B V18. The first new official record in the post-war period was achieved by a Gloster Meteor in November 1945, at 976 km/h (606 mph). The first aircraft to exceed the unofficial October 1941 record of the Me 163 AV4 was the Douglas Skystreak, which achieved 1031 km/h (641 mph) in August 1947. The July 1944 unofficial record of the Me 163B V18 was officially surpassed in November 1947, when Chuck Yeager flew the Bell X-1 to 891 mph (1434 km/h).\n\nThe official speed record for a seaplane moved by piston engine - still valid today - is 709.209 km/h, from the seaplane (\"idrocorsa\") Macchi-Castoldi M.C.72, attained on 23 October 1934, by Francesco Agello. It was equipped with the Fiat AS.6 engine (version 1934) developing a power of 3100 hp at 3300 rpm, with coaxial counter-rotating propellers. The original Macchi-Castoldi MC72 MM.181 seaplane that holds the record is kept in the Air Force Museum at Vigna di Valle in Italy.\n\nFlying between any two airports allow a large number of combinations, so setting a speed record (\"speed over a recognised course\") is fairly easy with an ordinary aircraft; it does require some paperwork.\n\n\n\n"}

It was previously operated by Spacecom as Amos-1, and formed part of the AMOS series of satellites. It was the first Israeli civilian communications satellite, and was initially positioned at 4° West longitude in geostationary orbit. It has since been moved to 47.3 degrees East.\n\nIts development was based on experience from Ofeq reconnaissance satellites in association with DASA and Alcatel Espace. It was launched on May 16, 1996 from Kourou in French Guiana, aboard an Ariane 4 rocket flying in the 44L configuration, which launched together with Indonesian Palapa C-2 satellite using Ariane 4's SPELDA system that can launched two satellites stacked on top of another. It was used for home TV services (DTH/DBS by \"Yes\" company in Israel and by HBO and others in Europe). Spacecom succeeded quickly to fill all transmission abilities of Amos-1 and accumulated additional requests. Therefore, Spacecom decided to build AMOS 2, which replaced AMOS-1 on orbit at 4 degrees West. AMOS-1 carries nine K band transponders.\n\nWeighing 970 kg at launch, Amos-1 incorporated a 400 Newton liquid apogee motor and fourteen reaction control thrusters, each delivering ten Newtons of thrust for raising the satellite's orbit from geostationary transfer orbit to its final geostationary orbit as well as for its attitude control. It carried 450 kg of propellant (monomethyl hydrazine and MON-3).\n\nAmos-1 measures 11.5 m in length in its final in-orbit configuration. It is 3-axis body stabilised using Sun and Earth sensors, momentum and reaction wheels. Its solar array generates 1380 W power, backed up by 24 A·h Ni-Cd batteries. After its launch, it was raised to its final geostationary orbit by firing the apogee boost motor in phases. After it reached the geostationary orbit, its antennae and solar panels were deployed and the satellite was placed in its allocated slot at 4° West longitude. Amos 1 and Amos 2 were placed near each other to enable satellite users to aim once and reach either satellite from the same antenna.\n\nIn 2009, Amos-1 was sold to Intelsat, and became Intelsat 24. Intelsat moved it over the Middle East, put it into an inclined orbit to conserve fuel, and rented its capacity to Tachyon Networks for US military communications.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26152", "title": "Romani people", "text": "Romani people\n\nThe Romani (also spelled Romany , ), colloquially known as Gypsies or Roma, are an Indo-Aryan, traditionally itinerant ethnic group living mostly in Europe and the Americas and originating from the northern Indian subcontinent, from the Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab regions of modern-day India.\n\nGenetic findings appear to confirm that the Romani \"came from a single group that left northwestern India about 1,500 years ago.\" Genetic research published in the \"European Journal of Human Genetics\" \"revealed that over 70% of males belong to a single lineage that appears unique to the Roma.\" They are a dispersed people, but their most concentrated populations are located in Europe, especially Central, Eastern and Southern Europe (including Turkey, Spain and Southern France). The Romani originated in northern India and arrived in Mid-West Asia and Europe around 1,000 years ago. They have been associated with another Indo-Aryan group, the Dom people: the two groups have been said to have separated from each other or, at least, to share a similar history. Specifically, the ancestors of both the Romani and the Dom left North India sometime between the 6th and 11th century.\n\nThe Romani are widely known among English-speaking people by the exonym Gypsies (or Gipsies), which some people consider pejorative due to its connotations of illegality and irregularity.\n\nSince the 19th century, some Romani have also migrated to the Americas. There are an estimated one million Roma in the United States; and 800,000 in Brazil, most of whose ancestors emigrated in the 19th century from Eastern Europe. Brazil also includes a notable Romani community descended from people deported by the Portuguese Empire during the Portuguese Inquisition. In migrations since the late 19th century, Romani have also moved to other countries in South America and to Canada.\n\nIn February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, the Indian Minister of External Affairs stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India. The conference ended with a recommendation to the Government of India to recognize the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the Indian diaspora.\n\nThe Romani language is divided into several dialects which together have an estimated number of speakers of more than two million. The total number of Romani people is at least twice as high (several times as high according to high estimates). Many Romani are native speakers of the dominant language in their country of residence or of mixed languages combining the dominant language with a dialect of Romani; those varieties are sometimes called Para-Romani.\n\n\nRom means man or husband in the Romani language. It has the variants dom and lom, related with the Sanskrit words \"dam-pati\" (lord of the house, husband), \"dama\" (to subdue), \"lom\" (hair), \"lomaka\" (hairy), \"loman\", \"roman\" (hairy), \"romaça\" (man with beard and long hair). Another possible origin is from Sanskrit डोम doma [member of a low caste of travelling musicians and dancers].\n\nIn the Romani language, \"Rom\" is a masculine noun, meaning 'man of the Roma ethnic group' or 'man, husband', with the plural \"Roma\". The feminine of \"Rom\" in the Romani language is \"Romni\". However, in most cases, in other languages \"Rom\" is now used for people of all genders.\n\n\"Romani\" is the feminine adjective, while \"Romano\" is the masculine adjective. Some Romanies use \"Rom\" or \"Roma\" as an ethnic name, while others (such as the Sinti, or the Romanichal) do not use this term as a self-ascription for the entire ethnic group.\n\nSometimes, \"rom\" and \"romani\" are spelled with a double \"r\", i.e., \"rrom\" and \"rromani\". In this case \"rr\" is used to represent the phoneme (also written as \"ř\" and \"rh\"), which in some Romani dialects has remained different from the one written with a single \"r\". The \"rr\" spelling is common in certain institutions (such as the INALCO Institute in Paris), or used in certain countries, e.g., Romania, to distinguish from the endonym/homonym for Romanians (\"sg. român, pl. români\").\n\nIn the English language (according to the Oxford English Dictionary), \"Rom\" is a noun (with the plural \"Roma\" or \"Roms\") and an adjective, while \"Romani\" (\"Romany\") is also a noun (with the plural \"Romani\", \"the Romani\", \"Romanies\" or \"Romanis\") and an adjective. Both \"Rom\" and \"Romani\" have been in use in English since the 19th century as an alternative for Gypsy. \"Romani\" was initially spelled \"Rommany\", then \"Romany\", while today the \"Romani\" spelling is the most popular spelling. Occasionally, the double \"r\" spelling (e.g., \"Rroma\", \"Rromani\") mentioned above is also encountered in English texts.\n\nThe term \"Roma\" is increasingly encountered, as a generic term for the Romani people.\n\nBecause all Romanies use the word \"Romani\" as an adjective, the term became a noun for the entire ethnic group. Today, the term \"Romani\" is used by some organizations including the United Nations and the US Library of Congress. However, the Council of Europe and other organizations consider that \"Roma\" is the correct term referring to all related groups, regardless of their country of origin, and recommend that \"Romani\" be restricted to the language and culture: Romani language, Romani culture.\n\nThe standard assumption is that the demonyms of the Romani people, Lom and Dom share the same origin.\n\nThe English term \"Gypsy\" (or \"Gipsy\") originates from the Middle English \"gypcian\", short for \"Egipcien\". The Spanish term \"Gitano\" and French \"Gitan\" have similar etymologies. They are ultimately derived from the Greek (\"Aigyptioi\"), meaning Egyptian, via Latin. This designation owes its existence to the belief, common in the Middle Ages, that the Romani, or some related group (such as the Middle Eastern Dom people), were itinerant Egyptians. According to one narrative they were exiled from Egypt as punishment for allegedly harbouring the infant Jesus. As described in Victor Hugo's novel \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", the medieval French referred to the Romanies as \"Egyptiens\". The word \"Gypsy\" in English has become so pervasive that many Romani organizations use it in their own organizational names.\n\nThis exonym is sometimes written with capital letter, to show that it designates an ethnic group. However, the word is sometimes considered derogatory because of its negative and stereotypical associations. The Council of Europe consider that 'Gypsy' or equivalent terms, as well as administrative terms such as 'Gens du Voyage' (referring in fact to an ethnic group but not acknowledging ethnic identification) are not in line with European recommendations. In North America, the word \"Gypsy\" is most commonly used as a reference to Romani ethnicity, though lifestyle and fashion are at times also referenced by using this word.\n\nAnother common designation of the Romani people is \"Cingane\" (alt. Tsinganoi, Zigar, Zigeuner), which likely derives from \"Athinganoi\", the name of a Christian sect with whom the Romani (or some related group) became associated in the Middle Ages.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, many Romanis choose not to register their ethnic identity in official censuses. There are an estimated 3.8 million Romani people in Europe (as of 2002), although some high estimates by Romani organizations give numbers as high as 14 million. Significant Romani populations are found in the Balkans, in some Central European states, in Spain, France, Russia and Ukraine. Several million more Romanies may live out of Europe, in particular in the Middle East and in the Americas.\n\nLike the Roma in general, many different ethnonyms are given to subgroups of Roma. Sometimes a subgroup uses more than one endonym, is commonly known by an exonym or erroneously by the endonym of another subgroup. The only name approaching an all-encompassing self-description is \"Rom\". Even when subgroups don't use the name, they all acknowledge a common origin and a dichotomy between themselves and \"Gadjo\" (non-Roma). For instance, while the main group of Roma in German-speaking countries refer to themselves as Sinti, their name for their original language is \"Romanes\".\n\nSubgroups have been described as, in part, a result of the Hindu caste system, which the founding population of \"Rom\" almost certainly experienced in their South Asian \"urheimat\".\n\nMany groups use names apparently derived from the Romani word \"kalo\" or \"calo\", meaning \"black\" or \"absorbing all light\". This closely resembles words for \"black\" or \"dark\" in Indo-Aryan languages (e.g., Sanskrit काल \"kāla\": \"black\", \"of a dark colour\"). Likewise the name of the Dom or Domba people of North India – to whom the Roma have genetic, cultural and linguistic links – has come to imply \"dark-skinned\", in some Indian languages. Hence names such as \"kale\" and \"calé\" may have originated as an exonym or a euphemism for Roma.\n\nOther endonyms for Romani include, for example:\n\nThe Roma people have a number of distinct populations, the largest being the Roma and the Iberian Calé or Caló, who reached Anatolia and the Balkans about the early 12th century, from a migration out of northwestern India beginning about 600 years earlier. They settled in present-day Turkey, Greece, Serbia, Romania, Moldova, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Hungary and Slovakia, by order of volume, and Spain. From the Balkans, they migrated throughout Europe and, in the nineteenth and later centuries, to the Americas. The Romani population in the United States is estimated at more than one million. Brazil has the second largest Romani population in the Americas, estimated at approximately 800,000 by the 2011 census. The Romani people are mainly called by non-Romani ethnic Brazilians as \"ciganos\". Most of them belong to the ethnic subgroup \"Calés\" (Kale), of the Iberian peninsula. Juscelino Kubitschek, Brazilian president during 1956–1961 term, was 50% Czech Romani by his mother's bloodline; and Washington Luís, last president of the First Brazilian Republic (1926–1930 term), had Portuguese Kale ancestry.\n\nThere is no official or reliable count of the Romani populations worldwide. Many Romani refuse to register their ethnic identity in official censuses for fear of discrimination. Others are descendants of intermarriage with local populations and no longer identify only as Romani, or not at all.\n\nAs of the early 2000s, an estimated 3.8 to 9 million Romani people lived in Europe and Asia Minor. although some Romani organizations estimate numbers as high as 14 million. Significant Romani populations are found in the Balkan peninsula, in some Central European states, in Spain, France, Russia, and Ukraine. The total number of Romani living outside Europe are primarily in the Middle East and North Africa and in the Americas, and are estimated in total at more than two million. Some countries do not collect data by ethnicity.\n\nThe Romani people identify as distinct ethnicities based in part on territorial, cultural and dialectal differences, and self-designation.\n\nFindings suggest an Indian origin for Roma. Because Romani groups did not keep chronicles of their history or have oral accounts of it, most hypotheses about the Romani's migration early history are based on linguistic theory. There is also no known record of a migration from India to Europe from medieval times that can be connected indisputably to Roma.\n\nAccording to a legend reported in the Persian epic poem, the \"Shahnameh\", from Iran and repeated by several modern authors, the Sasanian king Bahrām V Gōr learned towards the end of his reign (421–39) that the poor could not afford to enjoy music, and he asked the king of India to send him ten thousand \"luris\", lute-playing experts. When the luris arrived, Bahrām gave each one an ox, a donkey, and a donkey-load of wheat so that they could live on agriculture and play music for free for the poor. But the luris ate the oxen and the wheat and came back a year later with their cheeks hollowed with hunger. The king, angered with their having wasted what he had given them, ordered them to pack up their bags and go wandering around the world on their donkeys.\n\nThe linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that the roots of the Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a large part of the basic lexicon, for example, regarding body parts or daily routines.\n\nMore exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with Hindi and Punjabi. It shares many phonetic features with Marwari, while its grammar is closest to Bengali.\n\nRomani and Domari share some similarities: agglutination of postpositions of the second Layer (or case marking clitics) to the nominal stem, concord markers for the past tense, the neutralisation of gender marking in the plural, and the use of the oblique case as an accusative. This has prompted much discussion about the relationships between these two languages. Domari was once thought to be a \"sister language\" of Romani, the two languages having split after the departure from the Indian subcontinent but later research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate languages within the Central zone (Hindustani) group of languages. The Dom and the Rom therefore likely descend from two different migration waves out of India, separated by several centuries.\n\nIn phonology, Romani language shares a number of isoglosses with the Central branch of Indo-Aryan languages especially in the realization of some sounds of the Old Indo-Aryan. However, it also preserves a number of dental clusters. In regards to verb morphology, Romani follows the exact same pattern of northwestern languages such as Kashmiri and Shina through the adoption of oblique enclitic pronouns as person markers, lending credence to the theory of their Central Indian origin and a subsequent migration to northwestern India. Though the retention of dental clusters suggests a break from central languages during the transition from Old to Middle Indo-Aryan, the overall morphology suggests that the language participated in some of the significant developments leading toward the emergence of New Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nGenetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in northwestern India and migrated as a group. According to the study, the ancestors of present scheduled tribes and scheduled caste populations of northern India, traditionally referred to collectively as the Ḍoma, are the likely ancestral populations of modern European Roma. In December 2012, additional findings appeared to confirm the \"Roma came from a single group that left northwestern India about 1,500 years ago.\" They reached the Balkans about 900 years ago and then spread throughout Europe. The team found that, despite some isolation, the Roma were \"genetically similar to other Europeans.\"\n\nGenetic research published in \"European Journal of Human Genetics\" \"has revealed that over 70% of males belong to a single lineage that appears unique to the Roma.\"\n\nGenetic evidence supports the medieval migration from India. The Romani have been described as \"a conglomerate of genetically isolated founder populations,\" while a number of common Mendelian disorders among Romanies from all over Europe indicates \"a common origin and founder effect.\"\n\nA study from 2001 by Gresham et al. suggests \"a limited number of related founders, compatible with a small group of migrants splitting from a distinct caste or tribal group.\" The same study found that \"a single lineage… found across Romani populations, accounts for almost one-third of Romani males.\" A 2004 study by Morar et al. concluded that the Romani population \"was founded approximately 32–40 generations ago, with secondary and tertiary founder events occurring approximately 16–25 generations ago.\"\n\nHaplogroup H-M82 is a major lineage cluster in the Balkan Romani group, accounting for approximately 60% of the total. Haplogroup H is uncommon in Europe but present in the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka.\n\nA study of 444 people representing three different ethnic groups in the Republic of Macedonia found mtDNA haplogroups M5a1 and H7a1a were dominant in Romanies (13.7% and 10.3%, respectively).\n\nY-DNA composition of Romani in the Republic of Macedonia, based on 57 samples:\nY-DNA Haplogroup H1a occurs in Romani at frequencies 7–70%. Unlike ethnic Hungarians, among Hungarian and Slovakian Romani subpopulations, Haplogroup E-M78 and I1 usually occur above 10% and sometimes over 20%. While among Slovakian and Tiszavasvari Romani the dominant haplogroup is H1a, among Tokaj Romani is Haplogroup J2a (23%), while among Taktaharkány Romani is Haplogroup I2a (21%). Five, rather consistent founder lineages throughout the subpopulations, were found among Romani – J-M67 and J-M92 (J2), H-M52 (H1a1), and I-P259 (I1?). Haplogroup I-P259 as H is not found at frequencies of over 3 percent among host populations, while haplogroups E and I are absent in South Asia. The lineages E-V13, I-P37 (I2a) and R-M17 (R1a) may represent gene flow from the host populations, excluding the Z93 branch of R1a, which is most frequent among Romani people in Turkey. Bulgarian, Romanian and Greek Romani are dominated by Haplogroup H-M82 (H1a1), while among Spanish Romani J2 is prevalent. In Serbia among Kosovo and Belgrade Romani Haplogroup H prevails, while among Vojvodina Romani, H drops to 7 percent and E-V13 rises to a prevailing level.\n\nAmong non-Roma Europeans Haplogroup H is extremely rare, peaking at 7 percent among Albanians from Tirana and 11 percent among Bulgarian Turks. It occurs at 5 percent among Hungarians, although the carriers might be of Romani origin. Among non Roma-speaking Europeans at 2 percent among Slovaks, 2 percent among Croats, 1 percent among Macedonians from Skopje, 3 percent among Macedonian Albanians, 1 percent among Serbs from Belgrade, 3 percent among Bulgarians from Sofia, 1 percent among Austrians and Swiss, 3 percent among Romanians from Ploiesti, 1 percent among Turks.\n\nThey may have emerged from the modern Indian state of Rajasthan, migrating to the northwest (the Punjab region, Sindh and Baluchistan of the Indian subcontinent) around 250 BC. Their subsequent westward migration, possibly in waves, is now believed to have occurred beginning in about AD 500.\nIt has also been suggested that emigration from India may have taken place in the context of the raids by Mahmud of Ghazni. As these soldiers were defeated, they were moved west with their families into the Byzantine Empire. The author Ralph Lilley Turner theorised a central Indian origin of Romani followed by a migration to Northwest India as it shares a number of ancient isoglosses with Central Indo-Aryan languages in relation to realization of some sounds of Old Indo-Aryan. This is lent further credence by its sharing the exact same pattern of northwestern languages such as Kashmiri and Shina through the adoption of oblique enclitic pronouns as person markers. The overall morphology suggests that Romani participated in some of the significant developments leading toward the emergence of New Indo-Aryan languages, thus indicating that the proto-Romani did not leave the Indian subcontinent until late in the second half of the first millennium.\n\nThough according to a 2012 genomic study, the Romani reached the Balkans as early as the 12th century, the first historical records of the Romani reaching south-eastern Europe are from the 14th century: in 1322 after leaving Ireland on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Irish Franciscan monk Symon Semeonis encountered a migrant group of Romani outside the town of Candia (modern Heraklion), in Crete, calling them \"the descendants of Cain\"; his account is the earliest surviving description by a Western chronicler of the Romani in Europe. In 1350 Ludolph of Saxony mentioned a similar people with a unique language whom he called \"Mandapolos\", a word some think derives from the Greek word \"mantes\" (meaning prophet or fortune teller). Around 1360, a fiefdom, called the \"Feudum Acinganorum\" was established in Corfu, which mainly used Romani serfs and to which the Romani on the island were subservient. By the 1440s, they were recorded in Germany; and by the 16th century, Scotland and Sweden. Some Romani migrated from Persia through North Africa, reaching the Iberian Peninsula in the 15th century. The two currents met in France.\n\nTheir early history shows a mixed reception. Although 1385 marks the first recorded transaction for a Romani slave in Wallachia, they were issued safe conduct by Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund in 1417. Romanies were ordered expelled from the Meissen region of Germany in 1416, Lucerne in 1471, Milan in 1493, France in 1504, Catalonia in 1512, Sweden in 1525, England in 1530 (see Egyptians Act 1530), and Denmark in 1536. In 1510, any Romani found in Switzerland were ordered put to death, with similar rules established in England in 1554, and Denmark in 1589, whereas Portugal began deportations of Romanies to its colonies in 1538.\n\nA 1596 English statute gave Romanies special privileges that other wanderers lacked. France passed a similar law in 1683. Catherine the Great of Russia declared the Romanies \"crown slaves\" (a status superior to serfs), but also kept them out of certain parts of the capital. In 1595, Ștefan Răzvan overcame his birth into slavery, and became the Voivode (Prince) of Moldavia.\n\nSince a royal edict by Charles II in 1695, Spanish gypsies had been restricted to certain towns. An official edict in 1717 restricted them to only 75 towns and districts, so that they would not be concentrated in any one region. In the Great Gypsy Round-up, Romani were arrested and imprisoned by the Spanish Monarchy in 1749.\n\nDuring the latter part of the 17th century around the time of the Franco-Dutch War both France and Holland needed thousands of men to fight. Some recruitment took the form of rounding up vagrants and the poor to work the galleys and provide labour force for the armies. With this background, Gypsies were targets by both the French and the Dutch.\n\nAfter the wars, and into the first decade of the 18th century, Gypsies were slaughtered with impunity throughout Holland. Gypsies, called ‘heiden’ by the Dutch, wandered throughout the rural areas of Europe and became the societal pariahs of the age. Gypsy-hunt or \"heidenjachten\", translated as \"heathen hunt\" happened throughout Holland in an attempt to eradicate them.\n\nAlthough some Romani could be kept as slaves in Wallachia and Moldavia until abolition in 1856, the majority traveled as free nomads with their wagons, as alluded to in the spoked wheel symbol in the Romanies flag. Elsewhere in Europe, they were subject to ethnic cleansing, abduction of their children, and forced labor. In England, Romani were sometimes expelled from small communities or hanged; in France, they were branded and their heads were shaved; in Moravia and Bohemia, the women were marked by their ears being severed. As a result, large groups of the Romani moved to the East, toward Poland, which was more tolerant, and Russia, where the Romani were treated more fairly as long as they paid the annual taxes.\n\nRomani began emigrating to North America in colonial times, with small groups recorded in Virginia and French Louisiana. Larger-scale Roma emigration to the United States began in the 1860s, with groups of Romanichal from Great Britain. The largest number immigrated in the early 1900s, mainly from the Vlax group of Kalderash. Many Romani also settled in South America.\n\nDuring World War II, the Nazis embarked on a systematic genocide of the Romani, a process known in Romani as the \"Porajmos\". Romanies were marked for extermination and sentenced to forced labor and imprisonment in concentration camps.\n\nThey were often killed on sight, especially by the Einsatzgruppen (paramilitary death squads) on the Eastern Front. The total number of victims has been variously estimated at between 220,000 and 1,500,000; even the lower figure would make the Porajmos one of the largest mass killings in history.\n\nThe treatment of Romani in Nazi partner states differed markedly. In the Independent State of Croatia, the separatist Ustasa organization killed around 25,000 Roma, almost the entire Roma population. The concentration camp system of Jasenovac, run by the Ustasa militia and the Croat political police, were responsible for the deaths of between 15,000 and 20,000 Roma.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia, they were labeled a \"socially degraded stratum,\" and Romani women were sterilized as part of a state policy to reduce their population. This policy was implemented with large financial incentives, threats of denying future welfare payments, with misinformation, or after administering drugs.\n\nAn official inquiry from the Czech Republic, resulting in a report (December 2005), concluded that the Communist authorities had practised an assimilation policy towards Romanis, which \"included efforts by social services to control the birth rate in the Romani community. The problem of sexual sterilisation carried out in the Czech Republic, either with improper motivation or illegally, exists,\" said the Czech Public Defender of Rights, recommending state compensation for women affected between 1973 and 1991. New cases were revealed up until 2004, in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland \"all have histories of coercive sterilization of minorities and other groups.\"\n\nThe traditional Romanies place a high value on the extended family. Virginity is essential in unmarried women. Both men and women often marry young; there has been controversy in several countries over the Romani practice of child marriage. Romani law establishes that the man's family must pay a bride price to the bride's parents, but only traditional families still follow this rule.\n\nOnce married, the woman joins the husband's family, where her main job is to tend to her husband's and her children's needs, as well as to take care of her in-laws. The power structure in the traditional Romani household has at its top the oldest man or grandfather, and men in general have more authority than women. Women gain respect and authority as they get older. Young wives begin gaining authority once they have children.\n\nRomani social behavior is strictly regulated by Hindu purity laws (\"marime\" or \"marhime\"), still respected by most Roma (and by most older generations of Sinti). This regulation affects many aspects of life, and is applied to actions, people and things: parts of the human body are considered impure: the genital organs (because they produce emissions), as well as the rest of the lower body. Clothes for the lower body, as well as the clothes of menstruating women, are washed separately. Items used for eating are also washed in a different place. Childbirth is considered impure, and must occur outside the dwelling place. The mother is considered impure for forty days after giving birth.\n\nDeath is considered impure, and affects the whole family of the dead, who remain impure for a period of time. In contrast to the practice of cremating the dead, Romani dead must be buried. Cremation and burial are both known from the time of the Rigveda, and both are widely practiced in Hinduism today (although the tendency is for Hindus to practice cremation, while some communities in South India tend to bury their dead). Some animals are also considered impure, for instance cats because they lick their hindquarters. Horses, in contrast, are not considered impure because they cannot do so.\n\nRomanipen (also \"romanypen\", \"romanipe\", \"romanype\", \"romanimos\", \"romaimos\", \"romaniya\") is a complicated term of Romani philosophy that means totality of the Romani spirit, Romani culture, Romani Law, being a Romani, a set of Romani strains.\n\nAn ethnic Romani is considered a gadjo in the Romani society if he has no Romanipen. Sometimes a non-Romani may be considered a Romani if he has Romanipen. Usually this is an adopted child. As a concept, Romanipen has been the subject of interest to numerous academic observers. It has been hypothesized that it owes more to a framework of culture rather than simply an adherence to historically received rules.\n\nMost Romani people are Christian, others Muslim, some retained their ancient faith of Hinduism from their original homeland of India, others have their own religion and political organization.\n\nThe ancestors of modern-day Romani people were previously Hindu, but adopted Christianity or Islam depending on their respective regions through which they had migrated. Muslim Roma are found in Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Egypt, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Bulgaria, forming a very significant proportion of the Romani people. In neighboring countries such as Serbia, Greece most of the Romani inhabitants follow the practice of Orthodoxy. It is likely that the adherence to differing religions prevented families from engaging in intermarriage.\nIn Spain, most Gitanos are Roman Catholics.\nSome brotherhoods have organized Gitanos in their Holy Week devotions.\nThey are popularly known as \"\".\nHowever, the proportion of followers of Evangelical Christianity among Gitanos is higher than among the rest of Spaniards.\nTheir version of \"el culto\" integrates Flamenco music.\n\nBlessed Ceferino Giménez Malla is recently considered a patron saint of the Romani people in Roman Catholicism. Saint Sarah, or Sara e Kali, has also been venerated as a patron saint in her shrine at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, France. Since the turn of the 21st century, Sara e Kali is understood to have been Kali, an Indian deity brought from India by the refugee ancestors of the Roma people; as the Roma became Christianized, she was absorbed in a syncretic way and worshipped as a saint.\nSaint Sarah is now increasingly being considered as \"a Romani Goddess, the Protectress of the Roma\" and an \"indisputable link with Mother India\".\n\nRomanies often adopt the dominant religion of their host country in the event that a ceremony associated with a formal religious institution is necessary, such as a baptism or funeral (their particular belief systems and indigenous religion and worship remain preserved regardless of such adoption processes). The Roma continue to practice \"Shaktism\", a practice with origins in India, whereby a female consort is required for the worship of a god. Adherence to this practice means that for the Roma who worship the Christian God, prayer is conducted through the Virgin Mary, or her mother, Saint Anne Shaktism continues over one thousand years after the people's separation from India.\n\nBesides the Roma elders (who serve as spiritual leaders), priests, churches, or bibles do not exist among the Romanies the only exception is the Pentecostal Roma.\n\nFor the Roma communities that have resided in the Balkans for numerous centuries, often referred to as \"Turkish Gypsies\", the following histories apply for religious beliefs:\n\n\n\nIn Ukraine and Russia the Roma populations are also Muslim as the families of Balkan migrants continue to live in these locations. Their ancestors settled on the Crimean peninsula during the 17th and 18th centuries, but then migrated to Ukraine, southern Russia and the Povolzhie (along the Volga River). Formally, Islam is the religion that these communities align themselves with and the people are recognized for their staunch preservation of the Romani language and identity.\n\nMost Eastern European Romanies are Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Muslim. Those in Western Europe and the United States are mostly Roman Catholic or Protestant in southern Spain, many Romanies are Pentecostal, but this is a small minority that has emerged in contemporary times. In Egypt, the Romanies are split into Christian and Muslim populations.\n\nRomani music plays an important role in Central and Eastern European countries such as Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, the Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania, and the style and performance practices of Romani musicians have influenced European classical composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms. The \"lăutari\" who perform at traditional Romanian weddings are virtually all Romani.\n\nProbably the most internationally prominent contemporary performers in the \"lăutari\" tradition are Taraful Haiducilor. Bulgaria's popular \"wedding music\", too, is almost exclusively performed by Romani musicians such as Ivo Papasov, a virtuoso clarinetist closely associated with this genre and Bulgarian pop-folk singer Azis.\n\nMany famous classical musicians, such as the Hungarian pianist Georges Cziffra, are Romani, as are many prominent performers of manele. Zdob și Zdub, one of the most prominent rock bands in Moldova, although not Romanies themselves, draw heavily on Romani music, as do Spitalul de Urgență in Romania, Shantel in Germany, Goran Bregović in Serbia, Darko Rundek in Croatia, Beirut and Gogol Bordello in the United States.\n\nAnother tradition of Romani music is the genre of the Romani brass band, with such notable practitioners as Boban Marković of Serbia, and the brass \"lăutari\" groups Fanfare Ciocărlia and Fanfare din Cozmesti of Romania.\n\nMany musical instruments like violins and guitars are said to have originated from the Romani. Many dances such as the flamenco of Spain and Oriental dances of Egypt are also said to have originated from them.\n\nThe distinctive sound of Romani music has also strongly influenced bolero, jazz, and flamenco (especially \"cante jondo\") in Spain. European-style gypsy jazz (\"jazz Manouche\" or \"Sinti jazz\") is still widely practiced among the original creators (the Romanie People); one who acknowledged this artistic debt was guitarist Django Reinhardt. Contemporary artists in this tradition known internationally include Stochelo Rosenberg, Biréli Lagrène, Jimmy Rosenberg, Paulus Schäfer and Tchavolo Schmitt.\n\nThe Romanies of Turkey have achieved musical acclaim from national and local audiences. Local performers usually perform for special holidays. Their music is usually performed on instruments such as the darbuka, gırnata and cümbüş.\n\nRomani contemporary art is art created by Romani people. It emerged at the climax of the process that began in Central and Eastern Europe in the late-1980s, when the interpretation of the cultural practice of minorities was enabled by a paradigm shift, commonly referred to in specialist literature as the Cultural turn. The idea of the \"cultural turn\" was introduced; and this was also the time when the notion of cultural democracy became crystallized in the debates carried on at various public forums. Civil society gained strength, and civil politics appeared, which is a prerequisite for cultural democracy. This shift of attitude in scholarly circles derived from concerns specific not only to ethnicity, but also to society, gender and class.\n\nMost Romani speak one of several dialects of the Romani language, an Indo-Aryan language, with roots in Sanskrit. They also often speak the languages of the countries they live in. Typically, they also incorporate loanwords and calques into Romani from the languages of those countries and especially words for terms that the Romani language does not have. Most of the \"Ciganos\" of Portugal, the Gitanos of Spain, the Romanichal of the UK, and Scandinavian Travellers have lost their knowledge of pure Romani, and respectively speak the mixed languages Caló, Angloromany, and Scandoromani. Most of the speaker communities in these regions consist of later immigrants from eastern or central Europe.\n\nThere are no concrete statistics for the number of Romani speakers, both in Europe and globally. However, a conservative estimation has been made at 3.5 million speakers in Europe and a further 500,000 elsewhere, although the actual number may be considerably higher. This makes Romani the second largest minority language in Europe, behind Catalan.\n\nIn relation to dialect diversity, Romani works in the same way as most other European languages. Cross-dialect communication is dominated by the following features:\n\nOne of the most enduring persecutions against the Romani people was their enslavement. Slavery was widely practiced in medieval Europe, including the territory of present-day Romania from before the founding of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in the 13th–14th century. Legislation decreed that all the Romani living in these states, as well as any others who immigrated there, were classified as slaves. Slavery was gradually abolished during the 1840s and 1850s.\n\nThe exact origins of slavery in the Danubian Principalities are not known. There is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia and Moldavia as free men or were brought as slaves. Historian Nicolae Iorga associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era, in which the Romanians took the Roma as slaves from the Mongols and preserved their status to use their labor. Other historians believe that the Romani were enslaved, while captured during the battles, with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving war prisoners may also have been adopted from the Mongols.\n\nSome Romani may have been slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, but most of them migrated from south of the Danube at the end of the 14th century, some time after the foundation of Wallachia. By then, the institution of slavery was already established in Moldavia and possibly in both principalities. After the Roma migrated into the area, slavery became a widespread practice by the majority population. The Tatar slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.\n\nSome branches of the Romani people reached Western Europe in the 15th century, fleeing as refugees from the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. Although the Romani were refugees from the conflicts in southeastern Europe, they were often suspected by certain populations in the West of being associated with the Ottoman invasion because of their physical features seemed related to the Turks. (The Imperial Diet at Landau and Freiburg in 1496–1498 declared that the Romani were spies of the Turks). In Western Europe, such suspicions and discrimination against a people who were a visible minority resulted in persecution, often violent, with efforts to achieve ethnic cleansing until the modern era. In times of social tension, the Romani suffered as scapegoats; for instance, they were accused of bringing the plague during times of epidemics.\n\nOn 30 July 1749, Spain conducted \"The Great Roundup\" of Romani (Gitanos) in its territory. The Spanish Crown ordered a nationwide raid that led to the break-up of families as all able-bodied men were interned into forced labor camps in an attempt at ethnic cleansing. The measure was eventually reversed and the Gypsies were freed as protests began to arise in different communities, sedentary gypsies being highly esteemed and protected in rural Spain.\n\nLater in the 19th century, Romani immigration was forbidden on a racial basis in areas outside Europe, mostly in the English-speaking world. (Argentina in 1880 prohibited immigration by Roma, as did the United States in 1885.)\nIn the Habsburg Monarchy under Maria Theresa (1740–1780), a series of decrees tried to force the Romanies to permanently settle, removed rights to horse and wagon ownership (1754), renamed them as \"New Citizens\" and forced Romani boys into military service if they had no trade (1761), forced them to register with the local authorities (1767), and prohibited marriage between Romanies (1773). Her successor Josef II prohibited the wearing of traditional Romani clothing and the use of the Romani language, punishable by flogging.\n\nIn Spain, attempts to assimilate the Gitanos were under way as early as 1619, when Gitanos were forcibly settled, the use of the Romani language was prohibited, Gitano men and women were sent to separate workhouses and their children sent to orphanages. King Charles III took on a more progressive attitude to Gitano assimilation, proclaiming their equal rights as Spanish citizens and ending official denigration based on their race. While he prohibited the nomadic lifestyle, the use of the Calo language, Romani clothing, their trade in horses and other itinerant trades, he also forbade any form of discrimination against them or barring them from the guilds. The use of the word \"gitano\" was also forbidden to further assimilation, substituted for \"New Castilian\", which was also applied to former Jews and Muslims.\n\nMost historians agree that Charles III pragmática failed due to three main reasons, ultimately derived from its implementation outside major cities and in marginal areas: The difficulty the Gitano community faced in changing its nomadic lifestyle, the marginal lifestyle in which the community had been driven by society and the serious difficulties of applying the pragmática in the fields of education and work. One author ascribes its failure to the overall rejection by the wider population of the integration of the Gitanos.\n\nOther examples of forced assimilation include Norway, where a law was passed in 1896 permitting the state to remove children from their parents and place them in state institutions. This resulted in some 1,500 Romani children being taken from their parents in the 20th century.\n\nThe persecution of the Romanies reached a peak during World War II in the \"Porajmos\", the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In 1935, the Nuremberg laws stripped the Romani people living in Nazi Germany of their citizenship, after which they were subjected to violence, imprisonment in concentration camps and later genocide in extermination camps. The policy was extended in areas occupied by the Nazis during the war, and it was also applied by their allies, notably the Independent State of Croatia, Romania and Hungary.\n\nBecause no accurate pre-war census figures exist for the Romanis, it is impossible to accurately assess the actual number of victims. Most estimates for numbers of Romani victims of the Holocaust fall between 200,000 and 500,000, although figures ranging between 90,000 and 4 million have been proposed. Lower estimates do not include those killed in all Axis-controlled countries. A detailed study by Sybil Milton, formerly senior historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum gave a figure of at least a minimum of 220,000, possibly closer to 500,000. Ian Hancock, Director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin, argues in favour of a higher figure of between 500,000 and 1,500,000.\n\nIn Central Europe, the extermination in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was so thorough that the Bohemian Romani language became extinct.\n\nIn Europe, Romani people are associated with poverty, are accused of high rates of crime and behaviours that are perceived by the rest of the population as being antisocial or inappropriate. Partly for this reason, discrimination against the Romani people has continued to the present day, although efforts are being made to address them. Amnesty International reports continued instances of Antizigan discrimination during the 20th Century, particularly in Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, and Kosovo. The European Union has recognized that discrimination against Romani must be addressed, and with the national Roma integration strategy they encourage member states to work towards greater Romani inclusion and upholding the rights of the Romani in the European union.\nThe Romanis of Kosovo have been severely persecuted by ethnic Albanians since the end of the Kosovo War, and the region's Romani community is, for the most part, annihilated.\n\nCzechoslovakia carried out a policy of sterilization of Romani women, starting in 1973. The dissidents of the Charter 77 denounced it in 1977–78 as a genocide, but the practice continued through the Velvet Revolution of 1989. A 2005 report by the Czech Republic's independent ombudsman, Otakar Motejl, identified dozens of cases of coercive sterilization between 1979 and 2001, and called for criminal investigations and possible prosecution against several health care workers and administrators.\n\nIn 2008, following the brutal rape and subsequent murder of an Italian woman in Rome at the hands of a young man from a local Romani encampment, the Italian government declared that Italy's Romani population represented a national security risk and that swift action was required to address the \"emergenza nomadi\" (\"nomad emergency\"). Specifically, officials in the Italian government accused the Romanies of being responsible for rising crime rates in urban areas.\n\nThe 2008 deaths of Cristina and Violetta Djeordsevic, two Roma children who drowned while Italian beach-goers remained unperturbed, brought international attention to the relationship between Italians and the Roma people. Reviewing the state of play in 2012, one Belgian magazine observed:\n\nThe 2016 Pew Research poll found that Italians, in particular, hold strong anti-Roma views, with 82% of Italians expressing negative opinions about Roma. In Greece 67%, in Hungary 64%, in France 61%, in Spain 49%, in Poland 47%, in the UK 45%, in Sweden 42%, in Germany 40%, and in the Netherlands 37% have an unfavourable view of Roma.\n\nIn the summer of 2010 French authorities demolished at least 51 illegal Roma camps and began the process of repatriating their residents to their countries of origin. This followed tensions between the French state and Roma communities, which had been heightened after French police opened fire and killed a traveller who drove through a police checkpoint, hitting an officer, and attempted to hit two more officers at another checkpoint. In retaliation a group of Roma, armed with hatchets and iron bars, attacked the police station of Saint-Aignan, toppled traffic lights and road signs and burned three cars. The French government has been accused of perpetrating these actions to pursue its political agenda. EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding stated that the European Commission should take legal action against France over the issue, calling the deportations \"a disgrace\". Purportedly, a leaked file dated 5 August, sent from the Interior Ministry to regional police chiefs included the instruction: \"Three hundred camps or illegal settlements must be cleared within three months, Roma camps are a priority.\"\n\n\nMany depictions of Romani people in literature and art present romanticized narratives of mystical powers of fortune telling or irascible or passionate temper paired with an indomitable love of freedom and a habit of criminality. Romani were a popular subject in Venetian painting from the time of Giorgione at the start of the 16th century; the inclusion of such a figure adds an exotic oriental flavour to scenes. A Venetian Renaissance painting by Paris Bordone (ca. 1530, Strasbourg) of the Holy Family in Egypt makes Elizabeth, a gypsy fortune-teller; the scene is otherwise located in a distinctly European landscape.\n\nParticularly notable are classics like the story \"Carmen\" by Prosper Mérimée and the opera based on it by Georges Bizet, Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", Herge's \"The Castafiore Emerald\" and Miguel de Cervantes' \"La Gitanilla\". The Romani were also depicted in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"As You Like It\", \"Othello\" and \"The Tempest\", all by William Shakespeare.\n\nThe Romani were also heavily romanticized in the Soviet Union, a classic example being the 1975 \"Tabor ukhodit v Nebo\".\nA more realistic depiction of contemporary Romani in the Balkans, featuring Romani lay actors speaking in their native dialects, although still playing with established clichés of a Romani penchant for both magic and crime, was presented by Emir Kusturica in his \"Time of the Gypsies\" (1988) and \"Black Cat, White Cat\" (1998). The films of Tony Gatlif, a French director of Romani ethnicity, like \"Les Princes\" (1983), \"Latcho Drom\" (1993) and \"Gadjo Dilo\" (1997) also portray gypsy life.\n\n\nGeneral\n\nLists\n\n\n\nEuropean countries Roma links\n\nNon-governmental organisations\n\nMuseums and libraries\n"}

{"id": "66241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66241", "title": "Transparency International", "text": "Transparency International\n\nTransparency International e.V. (TI) is an international non-governmental organization which is based in Berlin, Germany, and was founded in 1993. Its nonprofit purpose is to take action to combat global corruption with civil societal anti-corruption measures and to prevent criminal activities arising from corruption. It publishes for example the Global Corruption Barometer and the Corruption Perceptions Index. Transparency International has the legal status of a German registered voluntary association \"(Eingetragener Verein)\" and serves as an umbrella organization. Its members have grown from a few individuals to more than 100 national chapters which engage in fighting corruption in their home countries. TI confirmed the dis-accreditation of the national chapter of United States of America in 2017.\n\nAccording to the 2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report, Transparency International was number 9 of 100 in the \"Top Think Tanks Worldwide (non-U.S.)\" category and number 27 of 150 in the \"Top Think Tanks Worldwide (U.S. and non-U.S.)\" category.\n\nTransparency International states:\nTransparency International is the global civil society organization leading the fight against corruption. It brings people together in a powerful worldwide coalition to end the devastating impact of corruption on men, women and children around the world. TI's mission is to create change towards a world free of corruption.\n\nThe organization defines corruption as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain which eventually hurts everyone who depends on the integrity of people in a position of authority.\n\nIt develops tools for fighting corruption and works with other civil society organizations, companies and governments to implement them. Since 1995, Transparency International has issued an annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI); it also publishes a Global Corruption Report, a Global Corruption Barometer, and a Bribe Payers Index.\n\nIn 2013, Transparency International published the Government Defence Anti-corruption Index with which corruption in the defence sector of 82 countries was measured. Some governments have expressed criticism towards the methodology of the report. Mark Pyman, the founder of TI's Defence & Security program, defended the report in an interview and stressed the importance of transparency in the military sector. The plan is to publish the index every two years.\n\nThe Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranks countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be. It is a composite index – a combination of polls – drawing on corruption-related data collected by a variety of reputable institutions. The CPI reflects the views of observers from around the world.\n\nThe Corruption Perceptions Index has received criticism over the years. The main one stems from the difficulty in measuring corruption, which by definition happens behind the scenes. The Corruption Perceptions Index therefore needs to rely on third-party survey which have been criticized as potentially unreliable. Data can vary widely depending on the public perception of a country, the completeness of the surveys and the methodology used. The second issue is that data cannot be compared from year to year because Transparency International uses different methodologies and samples every year. This makes it difficult to evaluate the result of new policies. The Corruption Perceptions Index authors replied to these criticisms by reminding that the Corruption Perceptions Index is meant to measure \"perception\" and not \"reality\". They argue that \"perceptions matter in their own right, since... firms and individuals take actions based on perceptions\".\n\nTransparency International consists of chapters – locally established, independent organisations – that address corruption in their respective countries. From small bribes to large-scale looting, corruption differs from country to country. As chapters are staffed with local experts they are ideally placed to determine the priorities and approaches best suited to tackling corruption in their countries. This work ranges from visiting rural communities to provide free legal support to advising their government on policy reform. Corruption does not stop at national borders. The chapters play a crucial role in shaping its collective work and realising its regional and global goals, such as Strategy 2015. Transparency International's multi-country research and advocacy initiatives are driven by the chapters.\n\nAccording to its 2012 Annual Report, it is funded by western governments (with almost €5 million from the UK government) and several multinational companies, including oil companies Exxon Mobil and Shell, hedge funds KKR and Wermuth Asset Management, Deloitte and Ernst & Young. It does not however seem to affect their practices, as Exxon Mobil itself was ranked in 2008 as the least transparent of 42 major oil and gas firms.\n\nTransparency International was founded in May 1993. According to political scientist Ellen Gutterman, \"TI's presence in Germany, and indeed its organizational development and rise from a small operation to a prominent international TNGO, benefited from the activities \nand personal, elite connections of at least three key German individuals: Peter Eigen, \nHansjoerg Elshorst, and Michael Wiehen\".\n\nPeter Eigen, a former regional director for the World Bank, is recognized as a founder, along with others. Michael Wiehen was a World Bank official at Washington, D.C. Hansjörg Elshorst was managing director of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) (German Agency for Technical Cooperation). Other founding board members included John Githongo (former Permanent Secretary for Ethics and Governance in the office of the President, Kenya), General Electric lawyer Fritz Heimann, Michael J. Hershman of the U.S. military intelligence establishment (now President and CEO of the Fairfax Group), Kamal Hossain (Bangladesh's former Minister of Foreign Affairs), Dolores L. Español (the Philippines' former presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court), George Moody Stuart (sugar industrialist), Gerald Parfitt (Coopers & Lybrand, then PricewaterhouseCoopers in Ukraine), Jeremy Pope (New Zealand activist and writer), and Frank Vogl, a senior official at the World Bank and head of Vogl Communications, Inc., which has \"provided advice to leaders of international finance\".\n\nIn 1995, Transparency International developed the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). The CPI ranked nations on the prevalence of corruption within each country, based upon surveys of business people. The CPI was subsequently published annually. It was criticized for poor methodology and unfair treatment of developing nations, while also being praised for highlighting corruption and embarrassing governments.\n\nIn 1999, Transparency International began publishing the Bribe Payers Index (BPI) which ranked nations according to the prevalence that a country's multinational corporations would offer bribes.\n\nAt its annual meeting in November 2013 in Berlin, Transparency International's national chapters from Germany and Ireland proposed a resolution calling for the \"end of the prosecution of Edward J. Snowden... He should be recognized as a whistleblower for his help to reveal the over-reaching and unlawful surveillance by secret services... He symbolizes the courage of numerous other whistleblowers around the world.\"\n\nThe final resolution that was passed by the plenary excluded any reference to Snowden, and excluded a call for \"comprehensive protection on whistleblowers from all forms of retaliation\". The original resolution presented by the German and Irish chapters was weakened following the intervention of Transparency International's American chapter, TI-USA. \"The whistleblower resolution was watered down by the US delegation,\" a TI insider was quoted in an article published by the Huffington Post. \"TI USA is very corporate oriented, very inside the Beltway oriented.\"\n\nFive months earlier, in June 2013, representatives from Transparency International declined Snowden's request to meet him at the Moscow airport. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch met Snowden to support his asylum request, but Transparency International refused.\n\nIn January 2015 it was reported that Transparency International (TI) accepted $3 million from the German engineering multinational Siemens, which in 2008 paid one of the largest corporate corruption fines in history – $1.6 billion – for bribing government officials in numerous countries.\n\nTransparency International applied for and received the money from Siemens, even though TI's due diligence procedures prohibit the organization from accepting money from corporations that want to \"greenwash\" their reputations by making donations to TI. \"If any corporate donor is accused of having been involved in corruption, the donor can expect no protection from TI,\" the procedures state.\n\nTransparency International received the money from the Siemens Integrity Initiative about a year after the Initiative hired former TI staffer Jana Mittermaier, raising questions of a \"revolving door\" that has benefited both the organization and the company.\n\nSeveral of TI's national chapters also have accepted money from Siemens: $660,000 for TI USA, $600,000 for TI Italy, $450,000 for TI Bulgaria, and $230,000 for TI Mexico – each for a period of three years.\n\n\"This really shows that Transparency International is not as pure as people think,\" a TI insider told Corporate Crime Reporter.\n\nTransparency International Managing Director Cobus de Swardt said, \"We did not file an application to Siemens, we applied to the Siemens Integrity Initiative. There's a difference. We have not applied to Siemens.\" However, according to Siemens, the money for these grants is \"provided by Siemens.\"\n\nIn January 2017, the TI Secretariat confirmed that its International Board of Directors decided on 10 January 2017 to strip its US affiliate – Transparency International USA – of its accreditation as the National Chapter in the United States. Transparency International USA joins Transparency Croatia in having its credentials stripped.\nThe stated basis for the dis-accreditation was the board's recognition of differences in philosophies, strategies, and priorities between the former chapter and the Transparency International Movement. Elsewhere, it was reported that TI-USA came to be seen in the United States as a corporate front group, funded by multinational corporations – the same multinationals that corrupt the U.S. political system. TI-USA's million-dollar budget was provided by Bechtel Corporation, Deloitte, Google, Pfizer ($50,000 or more), Citigroup, ExxonMobil, Fluor, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, Marsh & McLennan, PepsiCo, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Raytheon, Realogy, Tyco ($25,000–$49,999), and Freeport-McMoRan and Johnson & Johnson (up to $24,999). TI-USA previously awarded an annual corporate leadership award to one of its big corporate funders. In 2016, this award went to Bechtel.\n\nIn April 2015 TI defended the decision by its American chapter, TI-USA, to give Hillary Clinton its Integrity Award in 2012. TI's statement followed a report by National Public Radio that Bill and Chelsea Clinton were not factual regarding the transparency of the Clinton Foundation.\n\nDue to a \"lack of confidence\", TI's chapter in Croatia was disaccredited by the organization's board of directors in November 2015. The previous year, several leaders of the Croatia chapter challenged the legality of the chapter president's election. The president was accused of falsifying records, conflicts of interest, and arbitrarily expelling 10 chapter members who opposed the hiring of staff against the organization's rules. The Croatian government eventually revoked the president's appointment.\n\nTransparency International has come under intense criticism for accepting millions of dollars from companies that have engaged in bribery. In 2014, Siemens donated $3 million to Transparency International after pleading guilty in 2008 to bribery charges in which it paid more than $1.6 billion in penalties relating to widespread corrupt practices in Greece, Norway, Iraq, Vietnam, Italy, Israel, Argentina, Venezuela, China and Russia.\n\nTransparency International's policy forbids accepting money from corrupt companies.\nIn January 2016 a dispute arose regarding TI's chapter in New Zealand. The Governance Director in TI's Berlin headquarters sought to block an ethics complaint filed against the chapter's board chair by preventing the complaint from being heard by the Berlin office. The Governance Director also submitted an affidavit challenging a New Zealand court's jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\nIn August 2015 former TI staffer Anna Buzzoni went public regarding retaliation she and her colleagues faced after reporting to managers questionable financial dealings at TI's Water Integrity Network. Two of Buzzoni's project responsibilities were suspended and she was transferred against her will. She left TI shortly before internal whistleblower guidelines were adopted in June 2014.\n\n"}
