{"id": "1175382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1175382", "title": "Cabbage roll", "text": "Cabbage roll\n\nA cabbage roll is a dish consisting of cooked cabbage leaves wrapped around a variety of fillings. It is common to the cuisines of the Balkans, Central, Northern, Eastern Europe, Azerbaijan and Iran, as well as West Asia and Northern China.\n\nMeat fillings are traditional in Europe, often beef, lamb, or pork seasoned with garlic, onion, and spices. Grains such as rice and barley, eggs, mushrooms, and vegetables are often included. Pickled cabbage leaves are often used for wrapping, particularly in Southeastern Europe. In Asia, seafoods, tofu, and shiitake mushroom may also be used. Chinese cabbage is often used as a wrapping.\n\nCabbage leaves are stuffed with the filling which are then baked, simmered, or steamed in a covered pot and generally eaten warm, often accompanied with a sauce. The sauce varies widely by cuisine. Always in Sweden and sometimes in Finland, stuffed cabbage is served with lingonberry jam, which is both sweet and tart. In Eastern Europe, tomato-based sauces or plain sour cream are typical. In Lebanon, it is a popular plate, where the cabbage is stuffed with rice and minced meat and only rolled to the size of cigar. It is usually served with a side of yogurt and a type of lemon and olive oil vinaigrette seasoned with garlic and dried mint.\n\nPopular among Europeans, and traditionally served among the Jewish on Simchat Torah, stuffed cabbage is described by Gil Marks to have entered Jewish cooking some 2,000 years ago. Recipes vary depending on region; Romanians and northern Poles prefer a savory sauce, while Galicia and Ukraine favor sweet-and-sour, for example.\n\nStuffed cabbage leaves () are popular all year round in Azerbaijan, but especially in the winter months when other vegetables are less available. The stuffing usually consists of rice and herbs such as coriander, mint and dill, onions and meat, although there is a variation – yalanchi (fake) dolma, which is meat-free.\n\nSarmale are Romanian stuffed cabbage rolls traditionally served on Christmas and New Year's Eve but also served throughout the year at weddings, baptism parties, and other large celebrations. Ground pork is mixed with sauteed caramelized onions and rice stuffed in a cabbage leaf, pickled sauerkraut leaf or grape leaf. For flavor, they usually consist of layers with smoked pork fat, smoked ribs, or smoked sausage.\n\nThe Romanian sarmale is a versatile dish, and the best way of consuming is reheated the next day. The flavor is different with an enhanced flavor. It can be prepared with a tomato base, dill base or combination. Sweet shredded cabbage layers in between the rolls of pickled cabbage leaves or sauerkraut layers in between of sweet cabbage leaves. The taste is significant different but still a great dish.\n\nStuffed cabbage rolls are the epitome of Polish nourishment. Pork and beef mixed with rice or barley are nestled in a cabbage leaf and cooked in the oven or on the stove until tender.\n\nPoles call them \"gołąbki\", which literally means \"little pigeons\". For Czechs and Slovaks, it's holubky, while Serbs and Croatians refer to them as sarma. Usually, the sauce is what sets them apart.\nThere's also a less popular version called \"leniwe gołąbki\" (lazy cabbage rolls) in which ingredients are chopped, combined together and baked or fried.\n\nIn Ukraine, the filling of \"holubtsi\" varies throughout the country. In the Carpathian region corn grits are used, whereas in the Poltava area buckwheat groats are preferred. The cereal is lightly cooked, mixed with fried onions, shkvarky (pork cracklings) or raw minced meat. The mixture is combined with spices and seasonings, and is then used as the filling for steamed fresh or pickled cabbage leaves. In spring cabbage leaves are often replaced with fresh beetroot leaves, and in the southwest – with fresh young grape leaves. The \"holubtsi\" are lightly fried and then stewed with tomato, mushroom sour cream or some other sauce. During Lenten periods this might be water mixed with kvas, while at other times it might be a meat broth.\n\nIn Left Bank Ukraine and in the south, \"holubtsi\" are usually big, made from the entire cabbage leaf, while in the Dniester region and the Carpathians the cabbage leaf is divided into several pieces. In the latter regions, cooks who made large holubtsi were considered lazy. In Poltava cooks preferred the large holubtsi because they were juicier. In most of Ukraine holubtsi were an everyday dish, but in most of Right Bank Ukraine, with the exception of Polissia, they were also included in holiday meals. Beginning in the 1920s, holubtsi began to be stuffed with a rice-meat mixture, and, instead of kvas, they began to be cooked in tomato juice, sauce or paste. This is the most common way they are prepared nowadays.\n\nHolubtsi are a popular dish for both everyday meal and as special occasion treat. For Sviata Vecheria (Christmas Eve Supper) in many regions of Ukraine holubtsi constitute one of the twelve traditional dishes served on the night. Only Lenten ingredients are used in this case. On occasion of Sviata Vecheria, Boykos and Transcarpathians make Holubtsi from \"kryzhavky\" (pickled whole heads of cabbage). Into these \"pickled\" holubtsi they put a stuffing of rice and mushrooms. Carpathian-style holubtsi are usually made from fresh cabbage and stuffed with corn grits, or with grated raw potato (Vorokhta, Verkhovyna, Kvasy). These are best served with mushroom gravy. To differentiate the different types of holubtsi, they are wrapped into different shapes: corn-filled ones are made into the shape of envelopes, with the edges folded in, potato-filled are simply rolled up. A classic Halychan (Galician) dish Sviat Vechir dish is holubtsi stuffed with grated potato and served with a mushroom machanka (dipping sauce).\n\nThe traditional Hungarian cabbage roll (töltött káposzta) can be made from pickled cabbage leaves, filled with minced pork meat. The Hungarian version often contains minced pepper (paprika) and is served with sour cream on top. Hungarians serve this food during the periods of time near Christmas and New Year's, but stuffed cabbage also belongs to the traditional pig slaughter.\n\nKåldolmar are Swedish cabbage rolls filled with minced pork and in some cases rice. They are usually eaten with boiled or mashed potatoes, gravy, and lingonberry jam. Kåldolmar are also popular in Denmark and in Finland, where they are known in Finnish as kaalikääryle (plural kaalikääryleet).\n\nThe dish is considered a variety of the dolma, common in Eastern Mediterranean countries. After losing the Battle of Poltava in 1709 Charles XII of Sweden fled to the city of Bender, in Moldavia, then controlled by his ally, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Charles XII spent more than five years in the Ottoman Empire, trying to convince the Sultan to help him defeat the Russians. When he finally returned to Sweden in 1715, he was followed by some of the Ottoman creditors from whom he had borrowed money to finance his wars. The creditors lived in Stockholm until 1732, and during this time it is most likely that the dolma was introduced in Sweden.\n\nThe first known Swedish recipe for Oriental dolmas was included in a famous Swedish cookbook written by Cajsa Warg, in 1765. At the end of the recipe, Ms Warg suggested that those who could not afford vine leaves could use preboiled cabbage leaves in their place.\n\nIn Sweden \"Kåldolmens dag\" (Day of the Cabbage Roll) is celebrated on November 30, the day of the death of Charles XII of Sweden. It was instated in 2010 as a reaction to the recent rise in anti-immigration views by showing the purported long history of a multifaceted Swedish cultural heritage, involving national symbols with international background. It is arranged by \"Kåldolmens vänner\" (Friends of the Cabbage Roll).\n\nNowadays, frozen \"Kåldolmar\" are sold in most big food stores.\n\nThe Russian version of cabbage rolls usually consists of mincemeat mixed with cooked rice or buckwheat wrapped in cabbage leaves and stewed in a mixture of sour cream and tomato sauce. In order to save time there is another variation of that dish called \"lenivye golubtsy\" (lazy cabbage rolls). In that case, the cabbage is chopped and mixed with mincemeat and rice so there is no need to wrap every meatball in a cabbage leaf.\n\nCabbage rolls are a staple diet of the population in Serbia and Croatia. Leaves of brined cabbage stuffed with ground beef with rice is a favorite during Christmastime and other non fasting holy days, while meat is omitted or substituted with crushed walnuts on fasting holy days. Traditionally cabbage rolls are simmered long in a paprika based sauce with chunks of smoked bacon.\n\nIn the Levant, namely Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan, cabbage rolls are called محشي ملفوف Malfoof mahshi. Traditionally the cabbage rolls consist of meat and rice but have vegetarian variants oftentimes cooked as part of a Lenten menu. Local traditions vary between cooking the rolls in a tomato sauce or in a lemon brine.\n\nIn Egyptian cuisine, cabbage rolls are called محشي كرمب, pronounced \"maḥshī kromb\" or \"maḥshī koronb\" (as Standard Arabic [m] often turns to [n] in proximity to [b] in Egyptian Arabic), literally translating to \"stuffed cabbage\". The leaves are fresh and commonly cut into smaller pieces and partially pre-cooked. The most common filling is a mixture of rice, onion, tomato, herbs, and spices (most typically including mint, dill, and cumin); meat is rarely used in Egyptian stuffed cabbage. The rolls are arranged in a pot and boiled in broth or tomato-based sauce, also including the herbs and spices. As the pieces of cabbage and therefore the rolls are small, the leaves are usually simply rolled around the filling almost like a small cigar, and are left open at the ends rather than folded around the filling to produce a completely enclosed package.\n\nIn regions heavily influenced by Polish immigrants, such as Chicago which claims the largest Polish population outside of Poland, Detroit, Pennsylvania, the southern tier of New York, and northeastern Ohio, the term usually refers instead to stuffed cabbage rolls, such as the Polish gołąbki. In some places these are known as \"pigs in a blanket\". Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe popularized the dish in New York City, where they became known as \"Jewish Cabbage\".\n\nCabbage rolls also feature prominently in the cuisines of Cajuns and Louisiana Creoles of southern Louisiana, where they usually take the form of ground pork mixed with rice and chopped vegetables stuffed into parboiled cabbage leaves and cooked in a tomato sauce-based liquid.\n\n\n"}

The network began broadcasting on 1 January 1993, and aimed to cover world news from a pan-European perspective.\n\nIt is jointly owned by several European and North African state broadcasting organisations, and since 2015 majority owned (53%) by Media Globe Networks led by Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris who is chairman of the supervisory board.\n\nIn 1992, following the First Persian Gulf War, during which CNN's position as the preeminent source of 24-hour news programming was cemented, the European Broadcasting Union decided to establish Euronews to present information from a European perspective. The channel's first broadcast was on 1 January 1993 from Lyon. An additional broadcast studio was set up in London in 1996. It was founded by a group of ten European public broadcasters:\n\n\nIn 1997, the British news broadcaster ITN purchased a 49 percent share of Euronews for £5.1 million from Alcatel-Alsthom. ITN supplies the content of the channel along with the remaining shareholders, which are represented by the SOCEMIE () consortium. Euronews SA is the operating company that produces the channel and holds the broadcasting licence. It is co-owned by the ten founders and:\n\n\nThe broadcast switched from solely analogue to mainly digital transmission in 1999. In the same year, the Portuguese audio track was added. The Russian audio track appeared in 2001.\n\nIn 2003, ITN sold its stake in Euronews as part of its drive to streamline operations and focus on news-gathering rather than channel management.\n\nOn 6 February 2006, Ukrainian public broadcaster Natsionalna Telekompanya Ukraïny (NTU) purchased a one percent interest in SOCEMIE.\n\nOn 27 May 2008, Spanish public broadcaster RTVE decided to leave Euronews to promote its international channel TVE Internacional. It also cited legal requirements to maintain low debt levels through careful spending as a factor influencing its decision to leave.\n\nIn February 2009, the Turkish public broadcaster TRT became a shareholder in the channel, and joined its supervisory board. TRT purchased 15.70% of the channel's shares and became the fourth main partner after France Télévisions (23.93%), RAI (21.54%), and VGTRK (16.94%).\n\nIn February 2015, the channel's executive board approved a bid by Media Globe Networks, owned by Egyptian telecom magnate Naguib Sawiris, to acquire a 53% controlling stake in the media outlet. The deal raised questions over Euronews's future editorial posture and independence.\n\nIn 2 October 2012, Euronews launched Euronews Radio. The service was designed for viewers who \"watching news is not an option\" by providing a direct simulcast to the TV channel, with \"No Comment\" segment being replaced by music. The music of the bulletin openings are also transmitted on Euronews Radio. Weather reports are read by a female announcer.\n\nOn 20 April 2016, the French subsidiary of Euronews launched an African version of their news service called Africanews in French and English.\n\nIn November 2016, the channel's executive board was in talks with NBCUniversal, parent company of NBC News, for a \"strategic partnership\". NBCU would acquire 15 to 30% ownership of the Euronews network, would contribute to Euronews content, and facilitate NBC News' expanded operations in Europe. After successful negotiations with the European Commission, who feared that the partnership would result on an \"Americanization\" of Euronews, the NBCUniversal News Group finally purchased a 25% stake in Euronews in February 2017 for $30 million. NBC News president Deborah Turness was appointed to head up international operations, and incumbent Euronews CEO Michael Peters, which has lead it since 2004, became CEO of the new partnership. Both report directly to NBC News chairman Andy Lack. The resulting partnership became known as Euronews NBC. \n\nAlthough Sawiris and NBC News have the largest stakes in Euronews, editorial control by SOCEMIE members has been assured, with the broadcasters having seven slots in the editorial board, as opposed to Sawiris' company (which has three slots) and NBC News, which only has one, thereby reducing rumours of an \"Americanization\" of Euronews' values. Editorial control is fully handled by Euronews' teams, with NBC only focusing on planning and coordinating tasks. After the formation of the partnership, video reports from NBC News' properties began to appear frequently on the TV channel and reports from NBCNews.com began to be distributed on its digital platforms. \n\nOn 9 May 2017, Euronews split its service into 12 language-specific editions, of which nine have a linear TV channel with its own language voiceover, but now including contents, on-air graphics (except for some segments) and its lower-third news ticker in the language. The \"glocal\" strategy allows the language editorial teams to personalise the content and presentation of their channel, not only by sharing own-produced content with other languages, but by producing content that is relevant to local audiences, and allowing local reporters and presenters to appear on camera in all its language editions. The splitting process finished on 24 May 2017. \n\nAlongside the major language split, satellite distribution for the German, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish channels was discontinued, now being only available via fiber-optic IP uplink. However, the discontinuation of the German-language channel from satellite distribution generated outcry from many German satellite TV owners, resulting on the restoration of the German-language channel on the Astra 1L satellite on 25 July 2017, via an unencrypted SD feed sitting alongside the French-language channel. Additionally, the Arabic and Persian language editions became available only on Euronews' website and apps, with the TV channels being discontinued, and the Ukrainian edition was discontinued outright, due to lack of funding from the Ukrainian government. Finally, the Euronews channel in English became known as the \"World\" edition, and distribution to premises in the American continent via fiber-optic IP uplink is set to begin later in 2018. These changes caused the elimination of 43 staff positions, mainly from the Ukrainian edition, causing major layoffs and production staff having more flexible roles. \n\nIn 2018, Euronews' English-language channel began to gradually revamp its programming schedule, with the roll-out of a new slate of presenter-led programming to compliment its already existing shows, a move that was reported earlier in the year, after the success of its presenter-led special reports and weekly programming introduced in recent years. Alongside conventional rolling news shows, debate programming, talk shows and new presenter-led shows will be offered during the weekly schedule, and throughout programmes, Euronews reporters from different nationalities will be offering context on stories close to their respective home nationalities. \n\nThe roll-out began on 22 May, when Euronews debuted the first of these new shows, \"Good Morning Europe\", a five-hour morning show which airs every weekday morning from 7am. It was first anchored by former RT correspondent Tesa Arcilla, which anchored it in a temporary basis. Some weeks later, former France 24 presenter Belle Donati began presenting the show, alternating with Arcilla; after she moved to Brussels in September, she became the main anchor of the slot. Two months later, on 17 July, Euronews debuted a six-hour breaking news show, \"Euronews Now\", anchored by Tokunbo Salako, covering the dayside and afternoon slots. On 3 September, the new evening programme lineup was launched, starting with a politics-focused show, \"Raw Politics\", hosted by Tesa Arcilla, and featuring former Sky News reporter Darren McCaffrey from Brussels. Two weeks later, on 17 September, the full roll-out was completed with the introduction of a 5-hour evening rolling news show, \"Euronews Tonight\", presented by former Sky News and BBC News presenter Sam Naz. The traditional pre-produced blocks of video content still remains on late nights and weekends. Most overnights now repeat the previous day's edition (either full or half length) of \"Euronews Now\".\n\nNew weekly programming is also being produced, including the weekly interview series \"Uncut\", which feature conversations from political leaders and newsmakers worldwide with minimum to no editing. The first episodes feature German-French politician Daniel Cohn-Bendit interviewing former UKIP leader Nigel Farage and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair about the Brexit uprising. Additionally, a new social media unit was created, with journalists with a background on digital news verification leading it. The newly-created team help to produce \"The Cube\", a social media segment during rolling news shows, focusing on analysis on treatment and reactions about news headlines on social media, with special attention at the major stories of the day. \"No Comment\", a long-standing element of Euronews' programming, remains on the channels' schedule, and it's being gradually integrated into the rolling news shows on the English-language channel. \n\nAdditionally, a major investment in mobile reporting via iPhone devices helped Euronews gain a major scoop, becoming the only TV news outlet worldwide to broadcast live coverage from the MV Aquarius, with Paris correspondent Annelise Borges (formerly with France 24) on assignment. Borges broadcast live during 10 days as the new Italian far-right government denied the Aquarius access to Italian ports. The coverage made headlines on many news outlets worldwide, and helped Euronews boost its credibility and its audience. The new Euronews also hired new correspondents in London, Berlin, Moscow, Rome, Madrid and Washington D.C., and gained access to NBC News' large network of correspondents worldwide.\n\nAs of September 2018, the other language editions are unaffected, with the pre-produced blocks of video content remaining at all times, although there are plans to introduce presenter-led programming during the morning slots on these other channels.\n\nAfter the takeover of Sky plc by NBCUniversal's parent company Comcast on 22 September 2018, EuronewsNBC will increase its worldwide reach, as it plans to closely integrate its operations (and those of NBC News) with those of Sky News.\n\nThe channel is available in 430 million households in 166 countries worldwide. It reaches more than 170 million European households by cable, satellite and terrestrial. It also began to secure availability on multimedia platforms such as IPTV and digital media.\n\nEuronews launched an application for mobile devices (Android, iPhone, and iPad) which is called \"Euronews Live\". The application is free of charge and is available on Google Play and the App Store. This app was later shut down quietly.\n\nThe following countries also broadcast Euronews through terrestrial channels for a limited amount of time:\n\nThe channel's programmes are also available by podcast, and it has also maintained a YouTube channel since October 2007.\n\nIn 2012, the largest Belarusian state network MTIS stopped broadcasting Euronews for unknown reasons.\n\nIn 2013, the new commercial channel Planet TV started broadcasting Euronews dubbed in Slovenian after Antenna TV SL purchased a major stake in the company. Euronews airs after closedown (or sign-off) of Planet TV, but both call sign logos are displayed.\n\nIn September 2016, Euronews disappeared from the Freesat channel list in the UK, in a move made by Sawiris.\n\nHigh-definition (HD) broadcasting was started on 2 November 2016 via satellite using Hot Bird-capacities (English audio only). Regarding the audio codec, Euronews used the AC3 format at the beginning here, changing to the AAC codec in March 2017, and changing it again to the MPEG codec in April 2017.\n\nThe current Euronews logo is the fifth. From 1 January 1993 to February 1999 the logo was in the lower right corner of the screen, from February 1999 to June 2008 it was in the upper left corner of the screen, from June 2008 to May 2016 it was in the upper right corner of the screen, and from May 2016 to present it has been in the lower left corner of the screen.\n\n\nEuronews primarily broadcasts from its headquarters in Lyon, but also maintains international bureaux for editorial or marketing purposes in Athens, Brussels, Budapest, Doha, Dubai, Istanbul, London, Paris and Washington D.C. \n\n\n"}

This name dated back to the peasant uprising that broke out in the Samlot district of Battambang Province in 1967. Under its long-time commander and then Minister of Defense Son Sen, the RAK had 230 battalions in 35 to 40 regiments and in 12 to 14 brigades. The command structure in units was based on three-person committees in which the political commissar ranked higher than the military commander and his deputy.\n\nCambodia was divided into zones and special sectors by the RAK, the boundaries of which changed slightly over the years. Within these areas, the RAK's first task was the peremptory execution of former Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK) officers and of their families, without trial or fanfare to eliminate KR enemies. The RAK's next priority was to consolidate into a national army the separate forces that were operating more or less autonomously in the various zones. The Khmer Rouge units were commanded by zonal secretaries who were simultaneously party and military officers, some of whom were said to have manifested \"warlord characteristics\". Troops from one zone frequently were sent to another zone to enforce discipline. These efforts to discipline zonal secretaries and their dissident or ideologically impure cadres gave rise to the purges that were to decimate RAK ranks, to undermine the morale of the victorious army, and to generate the seeds of rebellion. In this way, the KR used the RAK to sustain and fuel its violent campaign. The Air Force of the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army was formed in 1977 and disband in 1979.\n\nThe Kampuchean Revolutionary Army was the official name of the army of Democratic Kampuchea during the period of 1975 to 1979, mainly consisting of Khmer Rouge operatives. In 1979 during the Cambodian-Vietnamese war it was reformed into the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea to continue to fight against the People's Army of Vietnam and the new Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces.\n"}

According to internal historical records, three decades of extreme sicknesses caused by malaria brought the work to a stand-still.\n\nBetween the years 1873 to 1901, 14 priests either died or returned wrecked in health. The mission was slow to spread throughout Kachin populations in the early 20th Century until the arrival of the first Columban Missionaries from Ireland in 1936.\n\nWith \"Divine Providence\" re-instated in the architects of Catholicism in Kachin State, evangelization was resumed with \"renewed vigour and fresh hopes\" and by 1965 and 1966, the diocese was handed over to the local clergy.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and to this day, the Diocese of Myitkyina has been bringing gospel and aid to isolated and hazardous locations in Northern Myanmar.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31858106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31858106", "title": "Satellite subcarrier audio", "text": "Satellite subcarrier audio\n\nSatellite subcarrier audio is audio transmitted by way of satellite that utilizes a separate analog or digital signal carried on a main radio transmission (usually video) on a specific satellite transponder. More technically, it is an already-modulated signal, which is then modulated into another signal of higher frequency and bandwidth. In a more general sense, satellite subcarrier audio is an early form of satellite radio not intended for the consumer market but was initially unencrypted, thus receivable to satellite hobbyists.\n\nOriginal analog video only has one channel per transponder, with subcarriers for audio and automatic transmission identification service ATIS. Non-multiplexed radio stations can also travel in single channel per carrier (SCPC) mode, with multiple carriers (analog or digital) per transponder. This allows each station to transmit directly to the satellite, rather than paying for a whole transponder, or using landlines to send it to an earth station for multiplexing with other stations.\n\nSatellite subcarrier audio was initially transmitted in analog form. This method of audio transmission was first employed by Fujitsu in 1973 as part of a data line between the United States and Spain. By the early 1980s, the use of analog subcarriers for radio network distribution had become well-established.\n\nInitially, satellite subcarrier audio was tuned using commercial receivers or consumer-grade TVRO \"big dish\" satellite receivers. The audio ranged in frequency from 5.0 to 8.5 MHz for both left and right audio channels. Fine tuning options included monaural and discrete stereo tuning with three bandwidth modes: narrow (130 kHz), normal (280 kHz) and wide (500 kHz).\n\nSingle channel per carrier (SCPC) refers to using a single signal at a given frequency and bandwidth. Most often, this is used on broadcast satellites to indicate that radio stations are not multiplexed as subcarriers onto a single video carrier, but instead independently share a transponder. It may also be used on other communications satellites, or occasionally on non-satellite transmissions. In an SCPC system, satellite bandwidth is dedicated to a single source.\n\nAnalog SCPC subcarrier audio is received using dedicated satellite receivers. SCPC audio receivers tune a frequency range of 50 to 90 MHz with both wide and narrow bandwidth options. Receivers in the hobbyist price range included the Heil SC-One and the Universal Electronics SCPC-100 and SCPC-200.\n\nThe FM Squared satellite audio format was developed in 1986 by Wegener Communications and Subcarrier Systems (later SpaceCom Systems, Inc.).\n\nFM Squared is a method of transmitting analog satellite audio where video would normally be transmitted on a satellite transponder. FM Squared was once used to distribute Muzak and similar \"business\" music (sometimes referred to as elevator music) to retailers. FM Squared audio receivers tune a frequency range of 100 kHz to 9 MHz. Receivers that fell within the hobbyist price range included the Universal Electronics SC-50.\n\nAlthough not widely used until the early 2000s, digital subcarrier audio has existed almost as long as its analog technology counterpart. In 1972, the BBC deployed a digital audio transmission system linking their broadcast center to their remote transmitters. This technology wasn't applied to satellite communications, however, until the early 1980s.\n\nThe first widespread digital satellite audio distribution system was Digital Audio Transmission System (DATS). DATS was developed in 1982 by Scientific Atlanta. The DATS distribution system was first used by the largest U.S. radio networks such as Westwood One, ABC Radio Networks and NBC. The DATS system transmitted 15 kHz-wide audio subcarriers at a data rate of 1.544 Mbps using BPSK digital modulation.\n\nDATS was later superseded by the Spectrum Efficient Digital Audio Transmission (SEDAT) satellite audio distribution system. SEDAT allows more audio channels to be carried in the same frequency range as DATS. SEDAT, also developed by Scientific Atlanta, was primarily used by ABC Radio Networks. SEDAT transmissions ended in 2001.\n\nAs digital subcarrier audio encoding and modulation methods have matured, less-expensive \"standard\" systems of satellite audio distribution have developed. This trend started with the emergence of VSAT technology in 1986 and was further supplanted by leased space on DBS systems such as DirecTV and Dish Network. The two \"de facto\" methods for digital satellite audio transmission are digital single channel per carrier and multiple channel per carrier multiplexing.\n\nIn digital radio systems, several variable bit-rate data streams are multiplexed together to a fixed bitrate transport stream by means of statistical multiplexing. This makes it possible to transfer several video and audio channels simultaneously over the same frequency channel, together with various services. On communications satellites which carry broadcast television networks and radio networks, this is known as multiple channel per carrier or MCPC. Where multiplexing is not practical (such as where there are different sources using a single transponder), single channel per carrier mode (SCPC) is used. Digital SCPC differs from the older analog SCPC transmission method in that a digital SCPC signal carries more than just a single audio channel (two are used) but also coding and decoding information, ancillary and control data, and network identification data. Digital SCPC and MCPC subcarrier transmissions use satellite broadcast standards such as DVB-S and its successor DVB-S2 along with MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 compression formats, respectively. BPSK modulation has been replaced with newer modulation schemes such as QPSK (quadrature phase-shift keying).\n\nStarGuide was the second-generation system of digital audio distribution via satellite. Many of the largest U.S. radio networks upgraded from or supplanted DATS/SEDAT audio feeds with StarGuide II and III audio receivers. The StarGuide platform is a proprietary MCPC digital audio distribution system that uses proprietary MX3 multiplexing technology. The StarGuide II receiver handles data rates from 512 kbit/s to 6.144 Mbit/s (in MX3 mode) and up to 8.192 Mbit/s in normal mode. The StarGuide III receiver can handle data rates up to 25 Mbit/s and is capable of a larger number of data and code rates than its predecessor. Both the StarGuide II and III receivers can utilize proprietary StarGuide Service Module expansion cards, including the ability to interface with local area networks (LAN) using 10/100Base-T Ethernet connections.\n\nThe X-Digital Systems format is (as of 2011) the newest generation of digital satellite subcarrier audio technology used by the large radio networks in the United States. In 2007, X-Digital Systems acquired specific assets and patent licensing of StarGuide Digital Networks technology from DG FastChannel, Inc. The X-Digital Systems platform has been deployed by Clear Channel Communications, Premiere Networks (now an iHeartMedia subsidiary) and Citadel Broadcasting (who also owns the former ABC Radio Networks).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16019595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16019595", "title": "Tokyo International Conference on African Development", "text": "Tokyo International Conference on African Development\n\nTICAD has been an evolving element in Japan's long-term commitment to fostering peace and stability in Africa through collaborative partnerships. In this context, Japan has stressed the importance of \"Africa's ownership\" of its development as well as of the \"partnership\" between Africa and the international community. The exchange of views amongst the conference delegates serves to underscore the case for more, not less assistance from the major world economies.\n\nThe TICAD conferences were intended to help to promote high-level policy dialogue amongst African leaders and their development partners. It emerged in 1993 after the end of the Cold War in an era of 'aid fatigue' among donor countries, and was critical in regenerating strong donor interest in Africa. TICAD has evolved into a major global forum to promote development on the continent under the principles of African \"ownership\" and international \"partnership.\" These concepts became essential factors in the launch of the New Economic Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), a strategy for development designed by Africans themselves. Earlier TICAD meetings have also resulted in key outcomes, in particular when Japan is hosting the G8, as it is in 2008. In 2000, for example, Japan hosted the Okinawa G8 Summit and invited leaders from several African countries to attend. Ideas proposed at TICAD II were also taken up by the G8 in the creation of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\n\nTICAD I was held in 1993. African countries and their development partners discussed strategies for steps toward greater African prosperity. TICAD was formed at a time when the international community’s interest in Africa was starting to wane, and donor fatigue was setting in. This conference produced the \"Tokyo Declaration on African Development.\"\nDelegations from 48 African nations participated in the conference, including four heads of state: Twelve other nations sent delegations; and a number of international organizations also attended as delegates and as observers.\n\nThe conference was considered promising, but prospects remained uncertain. In the decades since that beginning, TICAD's quality has evolved in both complexity and quality. The emphasis has shifted from TICAD-I's relatively simple issues of direct aid to more multi-faceted and inter-related topics which combine in sustainable development programs.\n\nTICAD II in 1998. African countries and their development partners agreed on the \"Tokyo Agenda for Action\" (TAA), which was intended to become a commonly understood strategic- and action-oriented set of guidelines. Poverty reduction in Africa and Africa's fuller integration into the global economy were recognized a fundamental goals. Following the TICAD II, a 2001 ministerial conference provided opportunity to discuss NEPAD.\nInvitations were extended to a number of African countries and others. Some heads of state decided to attend; and a range of government ministers and others were amongst the participants in the conference.\n\nThe agreement on an agenda was only considered a first step.\n\nTICAD III was held in 2003, bringing together over 1000 delegates, including 23 heads of state and the Chairperson of the African Union. African countries and their development partners reviewed the achievements of the ten-year TICAD process, and there was discussion about future direction TICAD should take. \n\nInvitations were extended to a number of African countries and others. Some heads of state decided to attend; and a range of government ministers and others were amongst the participants in the conference.\n\nThe increase in numbers of heads of state attending signaled the modest acceptance of the forum as a potentially effective venue. Participants reaffirmed the contributions of the TICAD process to African development, noting its role in mobilizing the international community's interest and commitment to African development. In the years since TICAD-III, there has been the Africa-China, Africa-India and EU-AU summits, among others.\n\nTICAD IV (May 2008) was convened in Yokohama. In its 15-year history, this was the first time the conference was convened in a city other than Tokyo. Yokohama was preparing to mark the 150th anniversary of the opening of the port and the 120th anniversary of the commencement of the City Administration. In this context, TICAD IV and the slogan, \"Yokohama Meets Africa\" were intended to underscore the international character of the port and city.\nThis was the most heavily attended of the four TICAD events. Responding to the invitation were 51 African nations (all except Somalia), 17 African organisations, 12 Asian nations, 22 donor nations, and 55 international organizations, with a total of about 2,500 delegates. These included 40 presidents or prime ministers of African countries, twice the number of those present at TICAD III (2003). Also in Yokohama were organizers associated with \"official side events\" and other participants in the conference.\n\nTICAD IV consisted of plenary sessions and twenty-four \"thematic\" sessions. TICAD focused on strategies for better mobilizing the knowledge and resources of the international community in the core areas of: (a) economic growth; (b) human security, including achieving the UN's Millennium Development Goals; and (c) environment/climate change issues. In addition, TICAD IV tried to identify possible inter-linkages within the context of the G8 Hokkaidō Tōyako Summit in July 2008. In this context, World Bank and International Monetary Fund Development Committee Executive Secretary, Kiyoshi Kodera, spoke at a pre-event meeting in which he argued that everyone needs to \"accept the harsh reality\" that sub-Saharan African countries will remain heavily dependent on foreign aid until they find a new growth path.\n\nAttending the conference were representatives of the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), a number of donor countries, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other relevant agencies. The shared perspectives of the conference delegates served to underscore the case for immediate assistance to help Africa’s vulnerable economies to weather the global food and fuel crisis. Participants agreed that emergency food aid was necessary, but it was also necessary to carry out medium-to-long-term interventions, with special attention on the division of roles and complementarity among various development agencies.\n\nSmaller scale projects were also included in the TICAD agenda. The Japanese introduced a projected JICA investment in replicating the \"One Village One Product movement\" (OVOP) in African contexts. In this context, the President of Malawi's visit to Japan also included a visit to OVOP headquarters in Osaka.\n\nIn a speech delivered at TICAD-IV, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda committed the government to extending yen-denominated loans worth up to ¥415-billion (US$4-billion) and financial assistance totalling about ¥260-billion (US$2.5-billion) over the next five years. Fukuda also committed the government to establishing a fund at the Japan Bank for International Cooperation aimed at doubling investment in Africa. The financial assistance would be provided through the fund over the next five years to help develop road networks and other traffic infrastructure. The Japanese Prime Minister also announced plans to deploy a \"water defense force\" tasked with providing instruction in water management. Moreover, Fukuda explained that his government aimed to help foster as many as 100,000 experts in the health and medicine fields.\n\nFukuda's announcement that Japan would extend generous assistance to African countries in spite of its tight financial condition is aimed at burnishing Japan's credentials in the international community. Prime Minister Fukuda's speech was designed to strengthen Japan's leadership as host of the G-8 meeting because aid to Africa would be an important item on the meeting's agenda. Another reason for the government's magnanimity is that Japan is trying to strengthen its relations with African countries to win their support for its bid to gain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The Japanese government learned a lesson from the failure of its 2005 campaign for permanent membership at the Security Council: Support from African countries, which account for one-fourth of U.N. membership, is construed as indispensable if Japan is to succeed in its bid. In his speech, Fukuda said, \"Japan would like to work on U.N. Security Council reform in cooperation with its African friends.\" \n\nFukuda's actions during TICAD attracted media attention for what some journalists called the \"marathon of mini-summits.\" In two days, the 71-year-old Prime Minister of Japan met one by one with 40 leaders of African nations, dedicating approximately twenty minutes to each one; and he also met with seven private sector Africa supporters. In addition, the Economy, Trade and Industry Minister, Akira Amari, met with African leaders in an effort to work towards developing closer relationships with countries participating in the conference. During TICAD week, Amari met with the leaders of Angola, Gabon and Uganda on Tuesday and Wednesday (May 27–28). Amari met with the leaders of Madagascar, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa and Namibia on Thursday (May 29); and he met on Friday (May 30) with the leader of Nigeria. These Africa leaders are mainly exporters of resources necessary for manufacturers in Japan. For example, Nigeria is the biggest oil producer in Africa, and Angola has promising oil reserves. South Africa produces zirconium that is used for nuclear fuel rods, while the Democratic Republic of Congo produces cobalt, which is used by many industries for various purposes.\n\nJapan has long used aid as a key diplomatic tool. It was the world's top donor in 1991, but its overall assistance has been slipping as its debts increased. As China and India seeking to forge closer ties with the African continent, the conference is a key opportunity for Japan to maintain its diplomatic clout. According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Africa accounts for 89 percent of the world's total reserves of platinum, 60 percent of its diamonds, 53 percent of the cobalt, 37 percent of the zirconium and 34 percent of the chrome. The African continent remains a potential markets for Japan; and both China and India recognized an urgent need to secure commodities to fuel their economic booms.\n\nIn this context, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in 2006 can be said to have marked a watershed for Africa’s economic relations. The summit re-awakened the world’s major powers not only to China’s growing strategic influence in Africa but also highlighted Africa’s increasing importance. In recent years, China has been providing large-scale assistance to African countries with the aim of securing a stake in the rich natural resources in the African continent; and India has been doing the same.\n\nThe conference provided a venue for non-governmental entities to expand a range of high-level contacts. In addition to the World Bank, an African Development Bank (AfDB) group delegation led by the institution's president, Donald Kaberuka, attended TICAD-IV. Also amongst the 2,500 attendees were academics, such as the president of Tsukuba University in Japan and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University.\n\nThere were instances when the conference did not go as Japan expected. For instance, the Japanese government planned to include a statement in the Yokohama Declaration to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent from current levels by 2050. However, the government withdrew this provision after encountering fierce opposition from South Africa, a major polluter.\n\nTICAD summits underscore the importance Asian economic and political competitors place in getting on the right side of African leaders - many of whom are sitting on huge mineral, oil and other resources. Africa is also emerging as a last frontier for financial investors. The continent also offers a growing market for low-end manufactured goods that are no longer exportable to the developed countries of Europe and America.\n\nAfrican perspective<br>\nAfrican delegates arrived in Yokohama with a number of their own well-thought out agendas. Some voices argued that it would be better if Africa attended TICAD-V (2013) with a continental-wide agenda which could then be broken up into country-specific strategies which could be more fully explored during the subsequent bilateral meetings. Drawing up a common agenda detailing the trade and investment issues would seem a plausible strategy because the nations of the continent are grappling with similar challenge which include poor infrastructure and trade terms that are weighted heavily against Africa. In a sense, Thabo Mbeki embraced this continental strategy as he suggested that Africa's future economic growth should happen through trade and not aid. Mbeki said, \"Without discounting the importance of aid, improved terms of trade for Africa are critical to ensure its full integration into the global economy.\" He also observed that \"market access alone does not always translate in the ability for the developing countries to penetrate competitive world markets.\"\n\nThe two initial Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prizes were conferred in conjunction with TICAD IV. This prize was created in honor of Hideyo Noguchi, a prominent Japanese bacteriologist who discovered the agent of syphilis in 1911, and who died in Africa while working towards the development of a vaccine for virulent yellow fever.\n\nThe first awards of the Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize were planned to coincide with TICAD IV; and the conference venue was moved from Tokyo to Yokohama as another way of honoring the man after whom the prize was named. In 1899, Dr. Noguchi worked at the Yokohama Port Quarantine Office as an assistant quarantine doctor.\n\nThe first laureates of the Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize, like Noguchi himself, are both medical doctors with a career-long interest in epidemiology and public health. They are Dr. Brian Greenwood and Dr. Miriam Were. For the honorees, the Prize represents both an acknowledgement of their past accomplishments and an investment in their prospective contributions in the years ahead. Japanese Prime Minister, Yasuo Fukuda, made the actual award presentation; and the Emperor and Empress were present at the 2008 ceremony along with a large number of African heads of state.\n\nWith significantly large money prizes attending this award, the Noguchi Prize already rivals the major established scientific awards. From the outset, the 2008 Noguchi Prizes—consisting of a citation, a medal and an honorarium of 100 million yen (US$843,668) -- were only intended to be the first in a continuing series; and subsequent prizes are expected to be awarded every five years.\nThe prize, officially named \"The Prize in Recognition of Outstanding Achievements in the Fields of Medical Research and Medical Services in Africa Awarded in Memory of Dr. Hideyo Noguchi,\" is managed by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).\n\nAs TICAD-IV ended, plans were already being formulated for TICAD-V in June 2013. Prime Minister Fukuda Announced told delegates at TICAD-IV, \"I pledge that by 2012-five years from now-Japan will have doubled its official development assistance (ODA) to Africa, increasing it gradually over these years.\" At the same time, Fukuda said his government would double its grand aid and technical cooperation for Africa by 2012.\n\nTICAD-V was held in Yokohama 1–3 June 2013 and forty-one African heads of state, along with UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, attended. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe opened the conference by announcing a five-year $32 billion package to support infrastructure development and boost economic growth in Africa.\n\nThe conference ended as one of the largest summit meetings ever held in Japan with the participants totaling more than 4,500, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Minister for Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida, as well as representatives from 51 African countries including 39 heads of state and government, delegates from 31 development partner countries and Asian nations, 72 international and regional organizations, the private sector, NGOs and civil society. In addition, a variety of side events were held with much attendance from the public. TICAD V upheld the core message of \"Hand in Hand with a More Dynamic Africa.\" Under the concept, active discussions were conducted on the future of African development, centering on the main themes of TICAD V, namely \"Robust and Sustainable Economy,\" \"Inclusive and Resilient Society,\" and \"Peace and Stability.\"As an outcome, TICAD V adopted two outcome documents, namely, \"Yokohama Declaration 2013,\" presenting a future direction for African development, and \"Yokohama Action Plan 2013–2017,\" a road map for the TICAD Process over the next five years with specific measures.\n\nSince TICAD V, Japan has actively deployed its diplomacy toward Africa in order to maintain the momentum and to steadily implement its pledges. For example, the Japan–African Regional Economic Communities (RECs) Summit Roundtable was held in New York on the margins of the UN General Assembly on September 26, 2013, chaired by Prime Minister Abe. In the roundtable, participants exchanged views on agricultural development and food security. In addition, from November 24 to December 5, 2013, Japan dispatched a Public and Private Sector Joint Mission for Promoting Trade and Investment for Africa to the Republic of the Congo, the Gabonese Republic, and Côte d'Ivoire. Thus, Japan hopes to further develop its relations with Africa through such follow-up measures to TICAD V. Furthermore, Prime Minister Abe visited three African countries in January 2014, fulfilling his promise at TICAD V to visit Africa in the near future.\n\nTICAD VI will be the first TICAD to be held in Africa. Kenya and Gambia had bid for the chance to hold it, but Gambia withdrew to allow Kenya to win. It will be held in Nairobi and 5,000 delegates are expected.\n\n\n"}
