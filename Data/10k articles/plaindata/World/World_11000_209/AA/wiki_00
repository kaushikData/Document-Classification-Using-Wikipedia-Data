{"id": "471674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=471674", "title": "Alhurra", "text": "Alhurra\n\nAlhurra ( \"\" , \"the Free One\") is a United States-based public Arabic-language satellite TV channel that broadcasts news and current affairs programming to audiences in the Middle East and North Africa. Alhurra is operated by the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN), which also operates Radio Sawa.\n\nIts stated mission is to provide \"objective, accurate and relevant news and information\" to its audience while seeking to \"support democratic values\" and \"expand the spectrum of ideas, opinions, and perspectives\" available in the region's media. The network has also tried to distinguish itself from its numerous regional competitors by providing access to more in-depth coverage of U.S. issues and policies and coverage of a broader range of opinions and perspectives than normally heard on other Arab television networks.\n\nAlhurra began broadcasting on 14 February 2004 to 22 countries across the Middle East and North Africa. It has established itself as the third highest-rated pan-Arab news channel, surpassing viewership ratings for the BBC (English and Arabic), France 24 Arabic, RTV Arabic, CCTV, CNNi, and Sky Arabia. \n\nIn April 2004, an additional channel called Alhurra-Iraq was launched, featuring most of the Alhurra content, with additional programming specifically directed at the Iraqi audience. It is also broadcast on satellite and is available on terrestrial antennas throughout Iraq, including in Basra, and Baghdad. Alhurra-Iraq consistently achieves higher ratings in Iraq than both Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya.\n\nThe MBN is a non-profit organization financed through a grant from the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), an independent federal agency funded by the U.S. Congress. The BBG oversees all U.S. public broadcasting outlets and is intended to act as a firewall to protect the editorial independence and professional integrity of the broadcasters.\n\nAlhurra’s headquarters are in Springfield, Virginia. The network also maintains bureaus in Baghdad and Dubai, production centers in Beirut, Jerusalem, Cairo and Washington, D.C., as well as correspondents throughout the Middle East, North Africa, the United States and Europe.\n\nThe decision to launch Alhurra was prompted by frustration among U.S. government officials over perceived anti-American bias among the leading Arab television networks and the effect these channels were having on Arab public opinion regarding the U.S. Alhurra was intended to serve as an alternative to these channels by presenting the news in a more \"balanced and objective\" manner in an effort to improve the image of the United States in the Arab world.\n\nThe driving force behind the launch of Alhurra was Norman Pattiz, a media executive and founder and chairman of broadcast industry giant Westwood One. While serving as a member of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), the U.S. federal agency that controls all foreign non-military radio and TV broadcasts, Pattiz advocated strongly for the creation of a U.S.-funded television network specifically directed at Arab audiences. Pattiz had also previously been responsible for the creation of Radio Sawa, a BBG-administered Arabic-language radio network which broadcast a mix of music, entertainment, and news. The idea to launch Alhurra stemmed from the success that Radio Sawa had exhibited in reaching young audiences in the Middle East.\n\nPattiz believed that Arab audiences' views of the United States were being negatively influenced by existing Arab news networks' focus on coverage of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He argued that by presenting a wider range of perspectives on these conflicts and other U.S. policies, as well as a coverage of a broader variety of regional and global issues of interest to Arab audiences, a U.S.-funded satellite TV channel could help improve America's image in the region.\n\nIn an appearance on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" in May 2004, Pattiz described a powerful promotional video he helped produce which led to the successful launch of Alhurra:\n\nAs a result of Pattiz's efforts, the Bush administration requested funding for the channel from Congress, and obtained $62 million in funding for its first year of operation (including start-up costs). In the fall of 2003, construction began to renovate an old TV channel building in Springfield, VA into a modern broadcast facility for the new channel. Construction was completed less than six months later, and Alhurra's first broadcast aired 14 February 2004.\n\nIn 2016, Alhurra Television’s documentary series \"Delusional Paradise\" won the Silver Award at the Cannes Corporate Media & TV Awards. And the promotional video for the \"Delusional Paradise\" won a Bronze medal at the New York Festivals International Television & Film Awards.\n\nIn 2014, three Alhurra shows won the Special Jury Award at the \"CINE\" Golden Eagle Awards. \"Street Pulse\" (), \"Where are We Going\" () and a promotional clip for the project \"Syrian Stories\", have won prizes in 2014.\n\n\"Street Pulse\" won the prize of the best documentary in the Middle East for the year 2013, especially for the episode \"the Tragedy of Quarry Workers in Minya\" ().\n\nAlhurra broadcasts 24 hours a day and, like other BBG-run broadcasters, is commercial-free. In addition to reporting regional and international news, the channel provides information on a variety of subjects, including the rights of women, human rights, religious freedom, freedom of expression, health, entertainment news, sports, and science and technology. The network supplements its original programming with broadcasts of Arabic-subtitled versions of English-language programs familiar to U.S. (and global) audiences, such as PBS’s \"Frontline\" and \"NOVA\", A&E’s \"Biography\" and \"Modern Marvels\". In addition, the network reversions and repackages prominent American news and news magazine series, such as the PBS \"Newshour\" and CBS’ \"60 Minutes\" into its own Arabic-language feature news programs.\nAlhurra has over the years hosted a number of prominent politicians, journalists and intellectuals in one-on-one long format interviews. Guests have included many Heads of State, Supreme Court Justices, Foreign Ministers, National Security Advisors, Secretaries of State, Education, Commerce and many White House Officials from both parties. Many journalists have appeared on Alhurra including Tom Friedman, David Brooks, and other prominent politicos such as Mary Matalin, Jalal Talabani, Paul Volcker, John Bolton, Terry McAuliffe, Joe Lieberman, Susan Turnbull, Robert Zimmerman, Steve Murphy, David Corn, Peter Fenn, Michael Steele, Tony Coehlo, Alon Ben-Meir, and Eleanor Clift.\n\n\nAlhurra competes with more than 550 Arabic-language satellite TV channels for its audience in the Middle East, and as a result Alhurra initially struggled after its launch in 2004 to attract viewers in the already-crowded Arab media market. Annual surveys commissioned by the BBG showed that Alhurra's weekly audience grew by 28% between 2004 and 2008, surpassing 25 million. Recent surveys by international research organizations including ACNielsen show that Alhurra has consistently averaged approximately 26 million weekly viewers in its broadcast region from 2009–2011. While this number is dwarfed by the overall viewership of Qatar-funded channel Al-Jazeera and Saudi Arabia-funded Al-Arabiya, it is nevertheless greater than the viewership of all other non-indigenous Arabic-language news networks (including CNN Arabic, BBC Arabic and France24’s Arabic-language channel) combined.\nA BBG-commissioned poll in February 2011 found that 25% of Egyptians living in Cairo and Alexandria tuned into Alhurra during the protests in that country in January 2011, surpassing al-Jazeera’s 22% viewership during the same period.\n\nAlthough not a traditional viewership survey, University of Maryland/Zogby polls of several Arab nations (Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE) asked which channels viewers tuned into most often. Just 2% overall stated that Alhurra was the channel they turned to most often in 2008, and that number dropped to 1% in 2009 (this poll added Egyptian respondents).\n\nHowever, the channel’s popularity has shown some signs of improvement in recent years, particularly in Iraq, which has proven to be Alhurra's most successful market in the Arab world. A 2005 Ipsos poll found that just 14% of Iraqi respondents tuned into Alhurra (ranking 11th place). However, a 2008 Ipsos poll of Iraqi viewers found the network’s popularity had increased to 18%, overtaking Al Jazeera (15%). This improvement could be due to Alhurra’s launch of Alhurra-Iraq, an Iraq-focused channel with programming tailored especially to the Iraqi audience. In its FY2010 budget submission, the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) noted that the channel’s viewership had improved to 5th place in the Iraqi market.\n\nAlhurra journalists and correspondents have frequently faced threats, intimidation, and violence from both government and non-state actors opposed to their coverage.\n\nSome notable incidents include:\n\nThe fact that Alhurra is funded by the U.S. Congress through the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has led some critics to claim that the channel is \"state propaganda\" and presents its news with a pro-American bias. Alhurra has openly tried to distinguish itself from the perceived anti-American tone of its competition. Executives in the channel's early days instructed broadcasters to avoid the use of \"loaded\" terms (such as \"martyr,\" \"resistance fighters,\" or \"occupation forces\") used frequently on networks such as al-Jazeera in reporting about the U.S. military operation in Iraq, opting for terms like \"armed groups\" and \"U.S. and coalition forces.\"\n\nAlhurra is observed by Arab journalists as complying too scrupulously with embargoes on military information when Western media outlets frequently disregard these same requests. Steve Tatham, a British Royal Navy officer, recorded an instance in which a British officer briefed Arab and Western media that a humanitarian aid ship was being held back pending operations against Iraqi insurgents in the area. According to Tatham's account, when the officer asked the media to delay reporting this information for security reasons, Fox News disregarded the request whereas Alhurra complied.\n\nMouafac Harb, Alhurra's first news director who resigned from the organization in 2006, claimed that he left in part because he \"sensed the Broadcasting Board of Governors wanted Alhurra to promote U.S. foreign policy instead of just reporting the news.\" Harb claimed that at Alhurra there had been a \"tendency to please Washington and not the [Arab] audience.\"\n\nAlhurra has also faced criticism from American conservative pundits who claimed that the organization had been broadcasting \"anti-American\" content. In 2007, conservative columnist Joel Mowbray wrote a series of harshly critical op-eds in the \"Wall Street Journal\", claiming that Alhurra had become a \"platform for terrorists.\" Mowbray noted that Alhurra had broadcast live, unedited speeches by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, an interview with an alleged al-Qaeda operative who expressed joy at the 9/11 attacks, and a panel whose members offered conspiracy theories about alleged Israeli plans to destroy the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nMowbray also cited unnamed Alhurra staffers who accused news director Larry Register of \"trying to pander to Arab sympathies\" to make the channel more like Al Jazeera. Register – a veteran CNN producer who had been appointed as Mouafac Harb's successor with a charge to overhaul the channel's operations and increase viewership – was forced to resign as a result of the public uproar created by Mowbray's articles.\n\nA 2008 U.S. Inspector General's office report noted that Alhurra has taken significant steps to tighten its procedures and policies in order to protect the credibility that is critical to fulfilling its mission.\n\nA critical \"60 Minutes\" and \"ProPublica\" report in 2008 stated that \"there appeared to be little oversight of the daily operations\" of Alhurra. The report criticized Alhurra's top executives and directors for either lacking Arabic-language proficiency or possessing a media background to ensure that the broadcasts met basic journalistic standards.\n\nA 2010 report from the U.S. Inspector General's office noted that inspectors \"heard consistent reports of poor communication in the news operation.\" The inspector's main criticism was of the channel's news director Daniel Nassif, who was highlighted in reports of \"newsroom management issues that were reported to the inspectors to have arisen during his tenure or remain unsettled from an earlier time.\" The hiring of several employee's relatives also led to accusations of nepotism. However, the same report also determined that MBN exercised tighter editorial controls over its programming and maintained the editorial principles for balance and comprehensiveness found in the International Broadcasting Act of 1994.\n\n\n\n"}

The performances of the theatre are mainly from the Russian works of art and literature, and the remainder are performances from Azerbaijani and European classical writers. \n\nAt the end of the 19 century Russian troupes began to actively perform in Baku. The most famous of these troupes was the theater group led by Polonsky. This troupe performed at the Tagiyev Theater for more than twenty years. The theatre, with its fixed repertoire, props and clothing stores, and many decorative designs, were performing five days a week. With the consent and permission of Polonsky, the building of the Tagiyev Theater was rented to various Azerbaijani theater groups on Fridays.\n\nIn February 1918, the building was exposed to a terrible fire. After this accident, the troupe began to collapse. In the spring of 1920, Russia's \"Yarasa\" theater made a tour Baku. In April of the same year, the collective collapsed regarding with Red Army's attack. Some members of the troupe did not return to Russia, stayed in Baku.

Faith in the concept had generated strong outperformance for stocks outside the United States.\nHowever, over the course of 2008, as fears of recession mounted in the United States, worldwide stock markets declined heavily. Contrary to the decoupling hypothesis, the losses were greater outside the United States, with the worst experienced in emerging markets and developed economies like Germany and Japan. Exports make up especially large portions of economic activity in those places, but that fact was not supposed to matter anymore in a decoupled world because domestic activity was thought to be so robust.\nOn the other hand, after the slump the emerging countries experienced a strong recovery, much stronger than that in advanced economies.\n\nThe phenomenon of decoupling and re-coupling has been explained by observing that global demand for factors such as capital and raw material declines when one part of the world economy suffers a crisis, which benefits the remaining healthy parts of the world economy through lower interest rates and lower commodity prices. However, once the crisis reaches the stage where global lenders suffer significant losses, they will cut back on their loan supply and interest rates for everybody will rise.\n\nIn organizational theory, \"decoupling\" refers to the creation and maintenance of gaps between formal, symbolic policies and actual organizational practices on the ground. In contrast, \"recoupling\" is a process by which previously decoupled policies and practices become coupled, leading to substantive, rather than symbolic, compliance. Thus, recoupling is a process of organizational ritual becoming reality, of pretense becoming practice. Studies on re-coupling (or coupling) suggest that \"the initially created gaps between policy and practice may not be permanent: that is, policies and practices that were once decoupled may eventually become coupled.\"\n"}

Founded as the Estonian Radio Symphony Orchestra, it gave its first concert in a broadcast by Tallinn Radio on December 18, 1926. During the Soviet regime, in the 1950s, the orchestra became the first in the Soviet Union to perform the work of modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Carl Orff, previously suppressed by Stalin's regime. Following the collapse of Soviet rule, the lifting of emigration restrictions, and the rebirth of independent Estonia in 1991, almost half of the Orchestra's players migrated to the West in search of better career opportunities. This exodus of talent plunged the Orchestra's fortunes into a depression. After the nadir of 1993, the Orchestra enjoyed a strong recovery under the leadership of conductor Arvo Volmer.\nEstonian National Opera concert hall has been the home of Estonian National Symphony Orchestra for two decades.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36765525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36765525", "title": "NATGRID", "text": "NATGRID\n\nThe National Intelligence Grid or NATGRID is the integrated intelligence grid connecting databases of core security agencies of the Government of India to collect comprehensive patterns of intelligence that can be readily accessed by intelligence agencies. It was first proposed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008.The government of India in July 2016 appointed Ashok Patnaik as the Chief Executive Officer of the National Intelligence Grid. The appointment is being seen as the government's effort to revive the project.\n\nThe 26/11 attacks on Mumbai led to the exposure of several weaknesses in India's intelligence gathering and action networks. NATGRID is part of the radical overhaul of the security and intelligence apparatuses of India that was mooted by the then Home Minister P. Chidambaram. The National Investigation Agency and the National Counter Terrorism Centre are two organisations established in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks of 2008. Before the attacks, the American Lashkar operative David Coleman Headley had visited India several times and done a recce of the places that came under attack on 26/11. Despite having travelled to India several times and having returned to the US through Pakistan or West Asia, his trips failed to raise the suspicion of Indian agencies as they lacked a system that could reveal a pattern in his unusual travel itineraries and trips to the country. It is argued that had a system like the NATGRID been in place, Headley would have been apprehended well before the attacks.\n\nNATGRID is an intelligence sharing network that collates data from the standalone databases of the various agencies and ministries of the Indian government. It is a counter terrorism measure that collects and collates a host of information from government databases including tax and bank account details, credit card transactions, visa and immigration records and itineraries of rail and air travel. This combined data will be made available to 11 central agencies, which are: Research and Analysis Wing, the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation, Financial intelligence unit, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Enforcement Directorate, Narcotics Control Bureau, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs and the Directorate General of GST Intelligence.\n\nNATGRID is being implemented in four phases, the first two of which will be operationalised by 2014 at a cost of 1,200 crores and the first data sets will be retrievable by early 2013. The Cabinet Committee on Security approved the first two phases in 2011. The same year, P. Raghu Raman was appointed the Secretary and CEO of NATGRID and tasked with the establishment of the grid. The implementation of the third and fourth phases are expected to require amendments to several laws to allow for the sharing and transfer of data on items such as property and bank transaction details and internet usage. \n\nUnlike the NCTC and the NIA which are central organisations, the NATGRID is essentially a tool that enables security agencies to locate and obtain relevant information on terror suspects from pooled data of various organisations and services in the country. It will help identify, capture and prosecute terrorists and help preempt terrorist plots.\n\nNATGRID faced opposition on charges of possible violations of privacy and leakage of confidential personal information. Its efficacy in preventing terror have also been questioned given that no state agency or police force has access to its database thus reducing chances of immediate, effective action. NATGRID claims to be protected by several structural and procedural safeguards and oversight mechanisms including that of external audits and technology safeguards.\n\n"}

Sky Betting & Gaming also operates popular, free-to-enter football prediction game Soccer Saturday Super 6 and Sky Sports Fantasy Football.\n\nIn 2015, Sky plc sold an 80 percent stake in the company to CVC Capital Partners for £600 million, with Sky retaining a 20% stake in the company and agreeing to a long-term licence of the Sky brand. In 2018, CVC and Sky agreed to sell Sky Betting & Gaming to The Stars Group for £3.4 billion.\n\nSky Bet is the sports betting division of Sky Betting & Gaming, with the majority of its operations run from Leeds. The company allows betting via its website, telephone, mobile apps and interactive television through Sky. In August 2011 Sky Bet launched its Apple iPhone and iPad app and all markets are also available via Android devices. It remains one of the few sports betting companies in the UK not to operate traditional high street shops. The company was formerly known for the slogan 'It matters more when there's money on it'. In October 2011, a major new Sky Bet advertising campaign introduced the slogan ‘Nothing’s certain, that’s why it’s exciting’ and the concept of ‘What if?’, used by Sky Bet to advertise topical, sports betting special markets.\n\nSky Bet is licensed and regulated by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) (GCB).\n\nSky Bet had a dedicated TV channel of the same name on Sky channel 864, which closed on 13 February 2012.\n\nSky Bet's origins lie in BSkyB's acquisition of Sports Internet Group in July 2000 which included the small telephone and online sports betting based company Surrey Sports alongside two other companies; Planet Football and Opta Index. Surrey Sports was rebranded in July 2002 to create Sky Bet. The company grew in December 2006 when established online betting companies totalbet and ukbetting were consolidated into Sky Bet after BSkyB's purchase of 365 Media Group. Sky Bet features heavily (through advertising and shared content) on the former 365 Media Group sites, as well as skysports.com thanks to their common ownership and proximity (they are based in nearby Leeds). Sky Bet's success has prompted Sky to branch out within the betting and gaming industry. Former professional footballer and Sky sports pundit Jamie Redknapp is the face of Sky Bet's football betting product.\n\nIn October 2017, Sky Bet became the first online bookmaker in the world to offer instant withdrawals from its online platform into customers‘ bank accounts. The technology was built in-house and is called Fast Withdrawal. Withdrawals reach the customers’ accounts within two hours, but the process can also take as little as a few seconds. Upon rollout, the service was only available to Sky Bet customers with a Barclays bank account, although it will be compatible with other banking providers and payment processors in the near future.\n\nIn 2018, Sky Bet unveiled a new option that allows friends to create an accumulator bet together. This is one of the first online options to offer accumulators between people who know each other. In the past, friends have typically done group bets in person or through social media platforms.\n\nSky Vegas is the company's primary online casino division. It currently offers an online casino website. The company's online casino offering is distinguished from the majority of its competitors in that it now plays in-browser rather than requiring a software download (currently being flash based, formerly distributed on CD). The company uses the slogan 'All the best games, all in one place'.\n\nSky Vegas is licensed and regulated by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) (GCB).\n\nUntil 12 April 2011, Sky Vegas had a dedicated TV channel of the same name on Sky channel 864 (which was formerly called 'Sky Vegas Live'), when it was rebranded Sky Bet.\n\n'Sky Bet Vegas' was created in March 2003, initially with only 3 fixed odds casino-style games called 'Juicy Jackpot', 'Top Spin' and 'Super Keno'. As its name indicated, it was then part of Sky Bet but has since been made separate and rebranded to simply 'Sky Vegas'. When limitations on broadcasting Casino games through IDTV were lifted, the company began to offer games through its interactive facility alongside the Sky Vegas Live channel, which showed betting opportunities such as Virtual Horse and Greyhound races. Both the online casino and the television channel re-branded as Sky Vegas in January 2008, with the television channel later being renamed the Sky Bet channel in April 2011.\n\nSky Casino is the company's premium online casino site, with a focus on live table games.\n\nSky Poker is the company's online poker division, which allows users to play poker on their website using a browser, or via their download client. Like Sky Vegas, the company offers its service in browser as well as through the downloadable software. Sky Poker also has a mobile app, enabling users on the IOS platform to play poker on the go. Compatible with both iPhone and iPads, the tablet app was launched in May 2014, with the phone version following a few weeks later.\n\nThe company uses the slogan 'Up Your Game,' which tries to encourage players to increase their poker skills and knowledge through providing them with strategy articles and videos, alongside regular content from their Ambassador Neil Channing. Since 2007 Sky Poker had its very own TV channel which broadcast live coverage of hands that had been played at the Sky Poker tables. A presenter would talk through the show with a Poker Analyst present, who would give feedback and tips to help players improve their skills. The latest channel that Sky Poker TV broadcast on was Sky channel 861, although this ceased activity in March 2015. Due to Sky Betting & Gaming becoming an independent company, Sky Poker since had to review its options going forward. Sky Poker TV still remains, broadcasting a live show every Tuesday on Sky Sports. The channel will still continue to produce popular content such as the Sky Poker Cash Games and the UK Poker Championships coverage.\n\nIn 2014, Sky Poker announced that poker professional Neil Channing would be their new brand Ambassador. Neil will support Sky Poker by appearing on Sky Poker TV, writing blogs and strategy articles and appearing at their very popular live event, the UK Poker Championships (UKPC) held at Nottingham based casino, Dusk Till Dawn.\n\nSky Poker is licensed and regulated by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) (GCB).\n\n\nPlayers can also \"satellite\" into a tournament, which means qualifying through a series of smaller tournaments, for a small amount of money. Prize pools are subject to change. Sky Poker also offers Cash Poker, Sit & Go's and Omaha games.\n\nChannel 861 concluded in March 2015, although live shows still take place every Tuesday 10pm-midnight on Sky Sports 3.\n\nSky Bingo is the company's online bingo division. The company uses the slogan 'Believe in Better Bingo', echoing Sky's 'Believe in Better'.\n\nSky Bingo is licensed and regulated by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) (GCB).\n\nOddschecker is an odds comparison website, which compares the odds offered by the most popular betting companies that cater to British and Australian customers, including Sky Bet. It forms part of the betting content of some other sites, such as Bettingzone. The company also offers reviews and comparison of online gambling websites through its 'Casinochecker', 'Pokerchecker' and 'Bingochecker' sections.\n\nOddschecker was established in 2001 and acquired by Sky in 2007.\n\nSoccer Saturday Super 6 launched in 2008, is a free-to-enter online prediction game, whereby players must correctly predict the score lines of 6 selected matches in order to win the weekly jackpot of £250,000. There is a £5,000 consolation prize for the week's best performer if the jackpot is not won. Gillette Soccer Saturday presenter Jeff Stelling is the face of Soccer Saturday Super 6.\n\nSky Sports Fantasy Football in association with Gilette was improved and relaunched in 2011. Players choose and manage their own 'dream team' and score points according to the real-life performance of footballers. It is free-to-play and offers £100,000 in prizes.

For the year ended December 2003, GoldBet had recorded EBITDA of €260,000 on revenues of €8.5 million, with a net asset value of €246,415, and no bank debt.\n\nTrevor Beaumont, ukbetting’s Managing Director of Gaming, believed Europe represented a significant growth opportunity for ukbetting and sought to leverage the European market, a market that he was familiar with as former Racing and Trading Director of Coral and Managing Director of Eurobet.\n\nBSkyB then owned GoldBet in December 2006 after the purchase of 365 Media Group.\n\n"}
