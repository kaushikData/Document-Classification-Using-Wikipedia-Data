The station is owned by Ahmed Shah Afghanzai, an Afghan entrepreneur. It originally broadcast for 18 hours daily, but has been 24-hours since July 2004.\n\nAfghan TV has lots of entertainment programs, including sport, social and educational. It also has Indian, American, Korean and Arabic drama. It also broadcasts news, although this is also broadcast 24 hours a day on its sister channel, Afghan News.\n\nIn early 2006, the station was fined 50,000 AFN (Afghani) (approximately US$1,000) by the Afghan Supreme Court, after it had broadcast what the court called inappropriate images, including adult content.\n\nThe case was televised by Afghan TV and was covered extensively by other media outlets, however, the powerful clergy in the country succeeded in not only instating the fine on Afghan TV, but also severely restricting the ability of other television networks to broadcast entertainment.\n\nOn 15 June 2011, Afghan TV was launched in on the Hotbird 13°E satellite, meaning that the whole of Europe now can receive Afghan TV. Viewers in the Middle East can now receive Afghan TV on two satellites: Hotbird 13°E and Turksat 3A 42°E.\n\nOn 27 June 2011, the name 'Afghan TV' (on Hotbird) was suddenly renamed to 'boxelet.com'. It is unknown why this happened, even though the channel itself is Afghan TV and not Afghan News. Websites like KingOfSat state the channel as \"Afghan News TV\" and moved \"Afghan TV\" in the so-called channel cemetery.\n\nOn 1 July 2011, the channel started broadcasting in higher quality video on Hotbird, just like in Afghanistan.\n\nOn 23 December 2011, Afghan TV suddenly left Hotbird and ceased broadcasting on the satellite. They didn't put a notice on their website too. Viewers in west, north and central Europe are now unable to receive the channel. If you're in south or east Europe, you can still watch it via Express AM22. Also, central Europe viewers can get Express AM22 by a large and powerful satellite.\n\n"}

Under the terms of the treaty, the economic frontier was lifted and the Belgian franc and Luxembourg franc were set at a fixed parity (though revised in 1935 and 1944) establishing a monetary union, which existed up until the introduction of the Euro. The original treaty lasted for fifty years, expiring in 1972; this was extended for ten years in 1982 and again in 1992. On 18 December 2002, the two countries and the three regions of Belgium signed a new convention.\n\nIt has been seen as the forerunner of Benelux Union, which was established as the Benelux Customs Union in 1944 by the London Customs Convention and also includes the Netherlands. While many aims of the BLEU have been subsumed by the Benelux Union, and later the European Union, it still has some relevance in being able to decide more precise measures than these organisations. International trade statistics were available for BLEU only as a combined entity until 1999, when European Community rules required split information.\n\nCompared with the Zollverein, the UEBL had several advantages for Luxembourg. Belgium was only allowed to alter its customs tariffs or conclude trade treaties after consultation with the Luxembourgish government, whereas before 1918 Luxembourg had to go along with German decisions. Similarly, only Luxembourgish customs agents would operate in Luxembourg, while under the Zollverein Prussian officials had operated in Luxembourg. \n\nThe functioning of the UEBL was entrusted to a Board of Directors consisting of two Belgian members (including the chairman) and one Luxembourgish member, and the Higher Council of the Union (with three Belgian and two Luxembourgish members).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "271829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=271829", "title": "Chris Evans (presenter)", "text": "Chris Evans (presenter)\n\nChristopher James Evans (born 1 April 1966) is an English television presenter, radio DJ, businessman, voice actor and producer for radio and television. He started his broadcasting career working for Piccadilly Radio, Manchester, as a teenager, before moving to London as a presenter for the BBC's Greater London Radio and then Channel 4 television, where \"The Big Breakfast\" made him a star. Soon he was able to dictate highly favourable terms, allowing him to broadcast on competing radio and TV stations. Slots like the Radio 1 Breakfast Show and \"TFI Friday\" provided a mix of celebrity interviews, music and comic games, delivered in an irreverent style that attracted high ratings, though often also generated significant numbers of complaints. By 2000 he was the UK's highest paid entertainer, according to the \"Sunday Times\" Rich List. In the tax year to April 2017, he was the BBC's highest paid presenter, earning between £2.2m and £2.25m annually.\n\nIn 2005, he started a new career on BBC Radio 2, hosting his long-running Drivetime programme, before moving in 2010 to host \"The Chris Evans Breakfast Show\" every weekday morning. He previously presented \"The One Show\" on Fridays between 2010 and 2015. Since 2011, he has co-hosted Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park. \nIn 2015, he signed a three-year deal to lead a new \"Top Gear\" line-up. and presented a revival series of \"TFI Friday\".\n\nOn 4 July 2016, Evans announced that he would be stepping down as presenter of \"Top Gear\".\n\nOn 3 September 2018, Evans announced that he would be leaving his BBC Radio 2 Breakfast Show at Christmas that year and he would be returning to Virgin Radio UK to present their breakfast show..\n\nEvans was born in Warrington, England, the youngest child of bookmaker and health authority wages clerk Martin Joseph Evans (1921–1979), and Minnie Beardsall, who managed a corner shop. His siblings are brother David (born 1953) and sister Diane (born 1963). He started his schooling at St Margaret's Church of England Infants and Junior School, and later the Junior School in Orford, Warrington. Evans' father and both paternal uncles died of colorectal cancer. Evans' mother is a breast cancer survivor.\n\nEvans passed the Eleven-Plus exam and started at Boteler Grammar School, Warrington. After the death of his father, the 13-year-old Evans took part-time work at an outlet of T. J. & B. McLoughlin's newsagent–tobacconist in Woolston, and ran an alternative tuck-shop at Padgate High School, which was a comprehensive school he attended for the final three years of his secondary education. Evans left secondary school at age 16 after moving into the sixth form, and he then had a number of dead-end jobs in and around Warrington, including a private detective agency and notoriously as a \"Tarzan-ogram.\"\n\nEvans began his professional career at Piccadilly Radio, Manchester, in 1983, where he had previously had unpaid schoolboy work. Until 1984 Evans had three jobs: as an assistant to Timmy Mallett, and playing a character on his show called 'Nobby Nolevel' ('No 'O' Level'); acting as a disc jockey in the evenings at local pubs when he was not at Piccadilly Radio; and still working at the newsagents, opening up daily at 5 am to sort out the newspaper deliveries.\n\nEvans switched to a full-time position at the station in 1984, his new role including being driven around the Manchester area in the radio car to turn up at listeners' houses. In addition he was producer to presenter James H. Reeve. Following this he presented a weekday graveyard slot with competitions and segments where listeners had opportunities to sell their belongings on air.\n\nAfter working as a producer on Richard Branson's service \"The Superstation,\" where he produced material for Jonathan Ross, Evans went on to work at BBC London radio station GLR, first as a producer on Emma Freud's mid-morning show, then \"Weekend Breakfast\" with Danny Baker. Evans became a GLR presenter in early 1990, taking over a Saturday afternoon show. Three months later, he started presenting \"The Greenhouse\", a Monday to Thursday evening show; he remained on this slot until the end of 1990.\n\nIn early 1991, as a result of his first regular TV hosting work presenting the \"Power Up\" breakfast show on The Power Station for British Satellite Broadcasting, Evans moved to presenting \"Round at Chris's\", every Saturday morning from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, which he continued to present until April 1993.\n\nIn addition to his Saturday morning show on GLR, in March 1992 Evans began presenting a Sunday afternoon show on BBC Radio 1, replacing Phillip Schofield. His show, \"Too Much Gravy\", was broadcast from 14:30 to 16:00 and ended in September 1992. His move to Radio 1 was short-lived but seen as a huge success, with controller Johnny Beerling later admitting he wished he'd offered Evans a full-time show there and then. At the time, however, Evans objected that Radio 1 had attempted to constrain his style, preventing him from using the \"zoo\" format, allegedly because Steve Wright was already doing that on the station.\n\nIn April 1993, Evans left GLR and joined the new Virgin Radio, to host a Saturday morning show.\n\nEvans' departure from radio was in part so he could devote his time to the new Channel 4 breakfast television show, \"The Big Breakfast\", from 28 September 1992. Evans co-hosted the show with Gaby Roslin.\n\nEvans left \"The Big Breakfast\" on 29 September 1994 and formed his own television production company, Ginger Productions. Its first major programme, \"Don't Forget Your Toothbrush\", was broadcast between 1994 and 1995. The original concepts proved to be lucrative for Evans as its format was sold to numerous foreign broadcasters.\n\nIn April 1995, Evans returned to radio to host the flagship \"Radio 1 Breakfast Show\". Evans negotiated into his contract with Radio 1 a clause allowing him to still make television programmes, and specifically an option to make a Friday night programme for Channel 4. A further clause required the Breakfast Show to be produced independently by Evans' Ginger company, rather than in-house by BBC Radio.\n\nAllowed to create the \"zoo\" format he had previously been disallowed from performing on Radio 1, Evans was given a free rein by his friend, Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister. Critics hated innuendo-laden features like Honk Your Horn and In Bed with Your Girlfriend, but Evans put on 600,000 new listeners over Steve Wright – one for every £5 spent on salary and advertising. The effect also flowed through into the listening figures for later programmes. The audience grew as the breakfast format became more outrageous: humiliating assistant Holly Samos by repeatedly asking her about her sex life (Evans and Samos were reportedly in a relationship at periods through their time working together), and encouraging two female guests to perform a strip show on live radio. The show's highest listening figure reached 7.5 million.\n\nEvans began making editions of Channel 4's \"TFI Friday\" from 1996. The show – devised, produced and hosted by Evans through his Ginger Media company – combined celebrity interviews, musical guests and daft games and competitions. Largely based on the successful formula of his radio show, it was initially a big success. However, as the success of both shows peaked, combined with a string of celebrity relationships and highly publicised nights drinking with friends Danny Baker and Paul Gascoigne, the strain began to show, and a model emerged described as a \"template for his approach to all his subsequent projects – an abundance of enthusiasm at the beginning which eventually falls prey to boredom and shiftlessness.\"\n\nBeginning to think he was indispensable at Radio 1, the first big falling-out with management came in December 1995 after taking his crew out on a 17-hour pub-crawl which ended two hours before they were due on air: Evans was fined one day's pay, £7,000. In 1996, broadcasting watchdogs investigated a continual trail of complaints against the show: Radio 1 refused to comment, Evans never said sorry. Evans also made increasing public demands of the Radio 1 management: after taking an extra week of unplanned holiday, Evans chose to turn up half an hour late for his 06:30 show and then demanded that his hours were changed so that it was a permanent fixture – this request was accepted.\n\nHowever, after the summer break things got decidedly worse. Criticised by the broadcasting watchdog for a tasteless joke about Holocaust victim Anne Frank, Evans countered with an item about haemorrhoids. Asked by Bannister to watch the rules, Evans the next day branded Bannister \"The Fat Controller\". In November, Evans announced on air that he was medically unfit to be on the radio – Bannister re-negotiated his contract to double his holiday to twice that of other Radio 1 DJs. After more publicised public drinking and self-confessed illness, Evans' spell at the station ended in January 1997 when he quit after his demand not to host the show on Friday (to have a full day getting ready for his TV show) was not accepted.\n\n\"The Radio 1 Breakfast Show\" was taken over by Mark and Lard (Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley). When Evans found out that they were a ratings disaster, he quickly got in touch with BBC Radio 1 management to ask whether he could take back the show again. Station management declined but did offer him a weekend slot, which he turned down. In response to the falling ratings, bosses decided to replace its presenters with the relatively unknown Kevin Greening and the well known children's TV presenter Zoë Ball. Their tenure started on 13 October 1997.\n\nDuring a holiday in Killarney, he listened to the Irish broadcaster Gerry Ryan on the radio. Evans claims the variety on Ryan's show made him want to return to radio. Evans was then hired by Virgin Radio to host its breakfast show, prompting an immediate upsurge in station listening figures of 1.8 million to 2.6 million. His first show was on 13 October 1997, the same day as Kevin Greening and Zoë Ball on Radio 1. Starting at 7:00 am, Evans' crew presented the show from Monday to Friday, but without Evans participating on a Friday.\n\nAs Sir Richard Branson had decided to reduce his media holding, he began talks to sell the station to Capital Radio in a deal that would have given him 10% of holding company Capital Group. As this became public knowledge, Evans, who did not want to work for Capital, publicly dismissed them as \"a bleating, blowing asthmatic dog.\" On 9 December, with the assistance of investors, Evans' vehicle Ginger Media Group bought Virgin Radio from Branson for £85m, to control the interests both of Ginger Productions and Virgin Radio. Both Apax Partners and Branson each owned 20% of Ginger Media Group, while Evans and his investors owned the remaining 60%. The group later engaged in the prospect of buying the \"Daily Star\" newspaper, but decided against from commercial angles.\n\nOn 14 March 2000, Evans agreed the sale of Ginger Media Group to SMG plc for £225m. The sale made Evans the highest paid entertainer in the UK in 2000, estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List to have been paid around £35.5million. Following poor reviews of \"TFI Friday,\" and Evans himself handing over presentation of the last series to a series of \"friends\", the show was cancelled in December 2000.\n\nEvans continued to host the station's breakfast show, but echoes of his earlier dismissal from Radio 1 began to emerge. In May 2000, the station was fined £75,000 (then the largest penalty imposed by the Radio Authority) for his repeated on-air endorsement of Ken Livingstone in the London mayoral elections.\n\nVirgin Radio's new programme controller Paul Jackson, in light of audience figures which had dropped from a peak of 2.7 million to 1.7 million, had pruned Evans's \"zoo\" team and installed a music policy which replaced more eclectic choices with a strict diet of chart pop. As a result, on 20 June Evans was followed throughout the day by tabloid newspaper photographers, and undertook an \"18-hour bender\" which started after his show at 9.30 in the morning, and ended – after numerous pints of Kronenbourg and Guinness, plus five bottles of Dom Pérignon – with Evans asleep in front of a lap-dancer at Stringfellows. Later photographed by the tabloids that week with new wife Billie Piper in the nearest pub to their home in Hascombe, Surrey while claiming he was too ill to present his show, he was dismissed on 28 June 2001 for repeatedly failing to arrive at work. Evans was replaced by the older Steve Penk, whom Evans criticised for his age – 39 versus Evans's then 35.\n\nEvans attempted to sue Virgin Radio, claiming that he was unfairly dismissed and denied share options worth £8.6 million. On 26 June 2003, in the judgement of \"Evans v SMG Television Ltd. & Ors\" 2003 EWHC 1423 (Ch), Justice Lightman found that he had been fairly dismissed and was not entitled to the share options. Giving his ruling at the High Court, Evans was publicly criticised for his attitude by the judge, who said of Evans: \"He has the temperament of a prima donna.\" Virgin Radio/SMG later countersued, with Evans ordered to pay £1m towards their legal costs.\n\nIn his autobiography, Evans writes that shortly after the sale of Virgin Radio he was offered £56m for his SMG shares by Goldman Sachs. He declined the offer and eventually sold them for £250,000.\n\nIn August 2002 Chris Evans set up a radio and television production company, UMTV, with the aim of specialising in live, cutting-edge, entertainment programming. Over the next 3 years UMTV produced more than 375 hours of television, with mixed success. TV shows included \"Boys and Girls\" hosted by Vernon Kay for Channel 4, \"Johnny Vegas: 18 Stone of Idiot\" for Channel 4 / E4; \"OFI Sunday\" for ITV; \"Live with Christian O'Connell\" and \"Live with Chris Moyles\" for Five; and the BAFTA award-winning \"School of Hard Knocks\" for 4 Learning.\n\nFollowing two high-profile shows which failed to perform in the ratings, UMTV hired Terry Wogan and Evans' former \"Big Breakfast\" co-host Gaby Roslin to host a weekday morning magazine show, \"The Terry and Gaby Show.\" Evans said publicly that if this show failed he would set up a market stall. Despite critical acclaim the audience numbers never took off and Channel 5 axed the show after its year-long run, citing its high cost as a reason. True to his word, Evans was pictured at the end of the final show with a market stall and later he opened it for real at Stables Market, Camden.\n\nEvans re-entered public life in early 2005, presenting the breakfast slot of UK Radio Aid's day of programming for the victims of the Asian tsunami, which was aired on most of the UK's commercial radio stations, and also The BRIT Awards in 2005 and 2006. From April 2005, Evans presented a number of one-off Bank Holiday shows for BBC Radio 2, including coverage of the Live 8 concert in London.\n\nEvans then joined Radio 2 on a permanent basis in September 2005, presenting a weekly Saturday afternoon show from 14:00 to 17:00. His first show featured singer Robbie Williams, and accompanied by a posse including friend \"Big\" Pete Winterbottom and newsreader Andrew Peach. Evans told listeners to his first show: \"We've had a couple of test drives over the summer and we've decided to take it. Yes, we like this vehicle.\"\n\nThe show was well received by listeners and critics, and Evans was announced as the successor to Radio 2's \"Drivetime\" show on 2 March 2006, succeeding long-time host Johnnie Walker, beginning on 18 April. RAJAR audience figures published in August 2006 showed Evans had 150,000 fewer listeners than his predecessor's last show but was on par with previous years. The second set of RAJAR's published in October 2006 showed his audience was up by 109,000-year-on-year, and up by 33,000 compared with the previous quarter. Figures showed he was drawing an average audience of 4.9 million a day on his drivetime show. By the end of 2007, the show was averaging over five million listeners. On 7 September 2009 it was announced that Evans would take over breakfast show from Sir Terry Wogan after Wogan announced his intention to leave the show at the end of the year. Evans hosted his final drivetime show on 24 December 2009.\n\nEvans took over Radio 2 breakfast show on 11 January 2010, succeeding Sir Terry Wogan and eventually also Sarah Kennedy. While Evans replaced Wogan owing to his long-planned retirement, the circumstances of the latter remain controversial and supporters of Kennedy allege there was a deliberate intention to force her out so Evans' show could be lengthened. His first three songs were The Beatles' \"All You Need Is Love\" and \"Got to Get You into My Life\"; and Frank Sinatra's \"Come Fly with Me\". His co-presenters include ex-BBC TV newsreader Moira Stuart, sports presenter Jonny Saunders who was replaced in June 2011 by Vassos Alexander, and travel reporter Lynn Bowles. Features include The Gobsmackers (two songs selected by a listener that sound good played back to back).\n\nOn 3 September 2018, Evans announced live on air that he would be leaving the show and the station in December for Virgin Radio. on 11 September the BBC Director General Lord Tony Hall told the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that. as well as wanting a new challenge. releasing the salaries of those at the BBC earning more than 150k had been a contributing factor in Evans' leaving. A month later, Evans confirmed live on air that Zoë Ball would replace him on the show from January 2019.\n\nIn May 2006, Evans was named music radio personality of the year at the annual Sony Radio Academy Awards, defeating rivals Jamie Theakston, Lauren Laverne, Marc Riley and Tim Lovejoy to win. When accepting the award, Evans thanked the BBC for giving him \"a second chance.\" Evans won 'music radio personality' the following year, while his show won the Entertainment award. \"I didn't expect this,\" he said. \"I wouldn't have minded if I didn't win, but I really love the fact I have won.\" Evans was voted the 82nd most influential media personality in \"The Guardian\" newspapers 2007 poll.\n\nAfter his success in the 1990s, Evans' attempts at a TV comeback in the 21st century have been mixed with a record of poor ratings and cancellations, including falling viewing figures for his recent role as co-host of Friday editions of \"The One Show\". In November and December 2005 Evans presented \"OFI Sunday\" on ITV. In a move described by Private Eye as \"Partridgean\", ex-wife Billie Piper was the first guest on the programme. \"OFI Sunday\" was cancelled after just five shows following poor reviews and low viewing figures. Its cancellation led Evans to complain on air during his Saturday BBC Radio 2 slot that he no longer knew how to be successful on television.\n\nIn 2010, it was announced that Evans would be replacing Adrian Chiles as the Friday co-presenter of \"The One Show\" on BBC One. Chiles and then co-host Christine Bleakley left the show to join ITV. Evans presented the show on Fridays with Alex Jones, and occasionally covered other weekdays. Matt Baker presented and still presents (as of 2018) the show on a regular Monday to Thursday basis.\n\nIn 2015, Evans announced he was quitting \"The One Show\" to focus on \"Top Gear\".\n\nIn January 2011 Evans returned to Channel 4 to present a new reality show \"Famous and Fearless\", in which 8 celebrities in two teams, \"Boys\" and \"Girls\". The celebrities that took part on the boys' team were: Rufus Hound, Charley Boorman, Sam Branson (Son of Richard Branson) and Jonah Lomu. On the girls' team were Jenny Frost, Kacey Ainsworth, Sarah Jayne Dunn and Dame Kelly Holmes. Holmes won the girls'; Boorman won the boys' and the show outright. In February 2011, it was reported that the show had been axed after one series due to poor ratings.\n\nOn 16 June 2015, the BBC announced that Evans had signed a three-year deal to be the main presenter on the BBC Two motoring show \"Top Gear\", following the departure of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May.\n\nOn his radio show the next morning he confirmed his acceptance and explained the offer came after James May and Richard Hammond had confirmed to the BBC they would not be returning to the show. Before the announcement, he sent text messages to May, Hammond and Clarkson and received supportive replies from all three.\n\nIn February 2016, it was confirmed that Matt LeBlanc, Rory Reid, Sabine Schmitz, Chris Harris and Eddie Jordan would also be joining Evans for the twenty third series of \"Top Gear\". It was also revealed that the new series would begin airing in May 2016.\n\nThe first episode of the new series of six episodes was broadcast 29 May 2016. In June 2016 it was reported that fellow presenter LeBlanc had threatened to quit the show unless Evans was sacked, because of inappropriate behavior on set. The source alleged that Evans had become jealous of the attention the other presenters were getting and had become distanced from the group.\n\nOn 4 July 2016 Evans announced that he had stepped down as presenter of the show and cutting his contract with Top Gear short by two years. \nThroughout the duration of the new series, Evans had received strong criticism due to his presenting style.\n\nIn the tax year to April 2017, he was the BBC's highest paid presenter, earning between £2.2m and £2.25m. In 2015 Metro reported that Evans had given a London cabdriver, Gary Eales, a 40p tip.\n\nEvans has a daughter, Jade (born 1986), by former fiancée Alison Ward.

On 9 January 2015, Evans became a grandfather for the first time when daughter Jade gave birth to her son, Teddy Rupert.\n\nEvans married Carol McGiffin in 1991.

Almost three years after they had separated, Evans and Piper divorced in May 2007, but have remained on good terms.\n\nA keen golfer who plays with a handicap of 15, Evans met professional golfer, part-time model and columnist for \"Golf Punk\" magazine Natasha Shishmanian when they became golf partners in the All*Star Cup celebrity tournament in Newport – Evans gave his 17-year-old caddy at the 2005 event, Natalie Harrison, a £10,000 Russian Kristall Smolensk diamond he won for the quality of his play. Evans and Shishmanian married in August 2007, and held a reception in Faro, Portugal the following weekend, that was attended by Evans's former wife Piper. The couple have two sons, born in 2009 and 2012 respectively. Their elder son Noah has appeared a number of times on his father's Breakfast Radio show.\n\nIn March 2008, Evans said in his Radio 2 blog that he had taken \"magic mushrooms\" two days before attending a Meat Loaf concert at the Royal Albert Hall. He said: \"I thought I was chronicling the Albert Hall moving sideways on the back of a giant rock and roll crab, something I didn't think the world should miss.\" A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said the force would investigate any reports of class A drug-taking.\n\nA fan of fast cars, and particularly Ferraris, Evans was banned from driving for 56 days in 2001 and fined £600 after admitting to a speeding charge at Staines Magistrates' Court after being stopped by Surrey Police when driving at on the A3 road in Esher in January 2001.

On 18 May 2008, Evans attended RM Auctions/Sotheby's Ferrari auction in Maranello, Italy, and bought a 1961 250 GT Spyder California SWB formerly owned by US actor James Coburn for the then world record price of 6.4 million euros. In May 2010 he bought a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO, one of only thirty-six built, for £12 million. Reportedly he sold three Ferraris from his collection to pay for it. He sold it three years later for $42 million, more than triple what he paid for it.\n\nIn August 2002, Evans was a member of crew aboard the sailing yacht \"Nausicaa\" with six other people, when James Ward – landlord of the White Horse in Hascombe, Surrey, which was then Evans' local – drowned in an accident in the Solent. In September 2007, Evans and Shishmanian started taking helicopter lessons at Shoreham Airport.\n\nEvans is a first cousin of the father of former Scottish Rugby internationals Max Evans and Thom Evans.\n\nEvans is a supporter of the Labour Party; he also donated £100,000 to former Labour MP Ken Livingstone's mayoral campaign when he stood as an independent candidate in 2000.

Evans said: \"Ping and Pong arrived safe and well last night. Both healthy, both strong, happy and blessed, as was mum throughout.\"\n\nThe following lists are the main shows Evans has presented:\n\n\nTo date, Evans has written three autobiographies:\n\n"}

For many years Radio Capodistria was one of the three most listened radio stations in Italy, its signal is stretched even to the shores of Africa, carrying Socialist and Titoist cross-border propaganda particularly appreciated by the members and sympathizers of the Italian Communist Party, particularly its youth. After the independence of Slovenia, Radio Koper became an organizational unit of RTV Slovenia, which has eliminated the transmission system in Italy, while the cross-border program shifted to minority and regional.\n\nRadio Koper is the most listened radio station in the Slovenian Littoral and on both sides of the Slovenian-Italian border.

The group is intended to promote co-operation between the three countries in crisis zones. It exists mostly in the form of summit meetings between the leaders of these three countries, the most recent of which occurred on 7 February 2011. Previous meetings took place in Poznań, Poland (1998), Nancy, France (1999), Hambach, Germany (2001) and Nancy, France (2005). The Weimar Triangle also involves lower-level connections, such as the annual meeting between Foreign Ministers.\n\nThe most recent leaders' summit was hosted by President Bronisław Komorowski of Poland and attended by President Nicolas Sarkozy (France) and Chancellor Angela Merkel (Germany). Issues of renewing regular Weimar Triangle meetings, the Egyptian situation and improving relations with Russia were discussed (Among other topics). Both Germany and France urged Poland to join the pact for competitiveness.\n\nThe Weimar Triangle was established in the German city of Weimar in 1991, aimed at assisting Poland's emergence from Communist rule. Attending the meeting were the Foreign Ministers of each state: Roland Dumas of France, Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany, and Krzysztof Skubiszewski of Poland. Genscher chose Weimar for the inaugural meeting because it was situated in former East Germany.\n\nAt the 1992 meeting of the Weimar Triangle in France, Poland won agreement from Germany and France that it should have special association status at the Western European Union, the European arm of NATO.\n\nOn 5 July 2011, Poland, France, and Germany signed an agreement in Brussels to put together a unit of 1,700 soldiers, called the Weimar Battlegroup, that will be ready to deploy in crisis zones starting in 2013. The EU business newsletter reports that Poland will command the group, providing the core combat troops and a mechanised battalion, Germany will provide logistical support, and France will contribute medical support. The operational command centre will be based in Mont Valerien, located in a Paris suburb.\n\nShortly after the referendum on the status of Crimea held on March 16, 2014, the chairpersons of the Weimar Triangle parliaments's committees on foreign affairs – Elisabeth Guigou of France, Norbert Röttgen of Germany and Grzegorz Schetyna of Poland – visited Kyiv to express their countries’ firm support of the territorial integrity and the European integration of Ukraine. This was the first time that parliamentarians of the Weimar Triangle had ever made a joint trip to a third country.\n\nIn April 2016, Poland's foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski told daily newspaper \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" that the Weimar Triangle had lost its relevance for his country.\n\nOn 28 August 2016, representatives of the three countries vowed to \"reinvigorate\" the Weimar Triangle. German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the group would meet before the end of 2016, and French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said France would host a summit in November 2016. The stated reasoning for this reinvigoration were the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, as well as the ongoing European migrant crisis.\n\n\n\nSummit on 3 July 2006 in Weimar, Germany was postponed due to alleged indisposition of the Polish president Lech Kaczyński.\n\n\nIn March 2015, Germany's Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen hosted her counterparts Jean-Yves Le Drian of France and Tomasz Siemoniak of Poland to revive a meeting format intended to promote co-operation between the three countries in crisis zones; it was the first meeting between the Weimar Triangle defence ministers since 2007.\n\n\n\n"}
