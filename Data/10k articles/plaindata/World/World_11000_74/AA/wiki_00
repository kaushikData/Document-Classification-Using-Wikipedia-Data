The protest was aimed at the local diamond mine which the residents claimed to have harmed both them and the local environment. The result of the protest was a clampdown by Sierra Leonean police and the death of 2 protesters.\n\nSierra Leoneans had flocked to the country's largest mine after the election of Ernest Bai Koroma in September 2007. On 12 December, the government removed the miners after it was agreed that the miners could keep any diamonds uncovered during their work.\n\nOn 14 December, local police were ordered into the mine area to protect the Koidu Holdings company which runs the mine. Protesters had gathered at the gate, seeking housing and increased compensation for their sufferings. The police used live ammunition and tear gas to disperse the protesters, killing two and injuring eight others.\n\nOn the issue of resettlement of displaced villagers, Minister of Mineral Resources Alhaji Abubakarr Jalloh said the \"company is relatively slow in building the resettlement\". Minister Jalloh also sought for the miners to leave the area. President Koroma temporarily halted diamond mining across the country as a result of the incident.\n\n\n"}

It remains the only internationally approved programme specific to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) which has been collectively and unanimously endorsed by SIDS.\n\nThe full text of the BPOA was produced in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1994 at the first Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States, a conference mandated by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 47/189. The need for an islands specific conference was highlighted some two years prior at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit), held in Rio de Janeiro where 179 governments voted to adopt Agenda 21. Chapter 17, section G of Agenda 21 acknowledges that \"small island developing states are a special case both for environment and development ... [and] are considered extremely vulnerable to global warming and sealevel rise.\"\n\nIn 1999, the General Assembly of the UN held a special session to appraise five years of progress on the implementation of the BPOA (BPOA +5). The Assembly recognized progress as 'uneven' and identified key trends including increasing globalization, widening inequalities in income and a continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly Resolution (S-22/2) promised further action.\n\nThe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002) affirmed UN commitment to 'full implementation' of Agenda 21, alongside achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, the BPOA, and other international agreements. To this end, it recommended the convening of an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Program of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the General Assembly of the UN passed Resolutions 57/262 and 58/213, which mandated an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States to take place. The meeting was held in Port Louis, Mauritius between January 10-14, 2005. The final report emerging from this meeting significantly revised the original BPOA, and verified what previous reviews were alluding to, that the implementation of the BPOA had been largely unsuccessful. What emerged from it was a reorganising of the Programs \"priority areas\" and an entrenched commitment to the notion that economic growth would ultimately contribute to sustainable development.\n\n"}

It took place around Finta, now a commune in Dâmbovița County, Romania. \n\nThe battle began by an attack of Moldavian infantry and Tatar–Cossack cavalrymen. From the beginning, the Moldavians, Tatars and Cossacks were driven back by the Wallachian military forces and Lithuanian defenders. Subsequently, both armies advanced to meet in a marshland, where a great melee began. Wallachians, Polish-Lithuanians, \"Seimeni\" Serb and Hungarian mercenaries destroyed the entire force of Cossacks and Tatars, with their swords and bayonets; the Moldavians, alongside the German and Austrian mercenaries, retreated a kilometer to prepare for the attacks. They resisted a series of attacks by the Wallachian-led combined troops, until finally the Wallachians bombarded their positions. The German and Austrian mercenaries were all killed during the bombardment. 1,000 Moldavians, 4,000 Cossacks and 1,000 Tatars were taken as prisoners, and mistreated by Wallachians. Almost half of them perished in captivity or were sold as slaves.\n\nThe battle was a Wallachian decisive victory, resulting in the ousting of the Moldavian Prince and his replacement with Gheorghe Ștefan. There was a brief Wallachian occupation of Iași, and a siege of Suceava (where Tymofiy was killed).\n"}

The 500 French cavalrymen surprised the camp defenders, who fired a single volley before scattering. More than 3,000 of al-Qadir's followers (out of a camp population of 30,000) were captured, as were many of his possessions, including his warchest and a library valued at £5,000. Three days later, another 2,500 followers were captured.\n\nAl-Qadir fled to Morocco later that year, triggering French pressure on Morocco and the advent of the First Franco-Moroccan War in 1844.

{"id": "7552376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7552376", "title": "Broadcast signal intrusion", "text": "Broadcast signal intrusion\n\nBroadcast signal intrusion is the hijacking of broadcast signals of radio, television stations, cable television broadcast feeds or satellite signals. Hijacking incidents have involved local TV and radio stations as well as cable and national networks.\n\nAlthough television, cable and satellite broadcast signal intrusions tend to receive more media coverage, radio station intrusions are more frequent, as many simply rebroadcast a signal received from another radio station. All that is required is an FM transmitter that can overpower the same frequency as the station being rebroadcast. Other methods that have been used in North America to intrude on legal broadcasts include breaking into the transmitter area and splicing audio directly into the feed.\n\nAs a cable television operator connects itself in the signal path between individual stations and the system's subscribers, broadcasters have fallen victim to signal tampering on cable systems on multiple occasions.\n\nOn November 26, 1977, an audio message, purporting to come from outer space, was broadcast during an ITN news bulletin on Southern Television in the UK. The intrusion did not affect the video signal but replaced the programme audio with warnings as to the destiny of the human race and a disaster to affect \"your world and the beings on other worlds around you\". The IBA confirmed that it was the first time such a transmission had been made. None of the individuals responsible for the intrusion have been identified, although some people believe that the message could have originated from an alien race.\n\nAt 12:32 am Eastern Time on April 27, 1986, HBO (Home Box Office) had its satellite signal feed from its operations center on Long Island in Hauppauge, New York interrupted by a man calling himself \"Captain Midnight\". The interruption occurred during a presentation of \"The Falcon and the Snowman\". The intrusion lasted between 4 and 5 minutes and was seen by viewers along the East Coast. The man, who during the interruption also threatened to hijack the signals of Showtime and The Movie Channel, was later caught and identified as John R. MacDougall of Ocala, Florida. He was prosecuted shortly thereafter. Authorities were tipped off by a man from Wisconsin in a phone booth at a rest area off Interstate 75 in Gainesville, Florida. The man filing the report said that he overheard MacDougall bragging about it.\n\nMacDougall's guilt was confirmed by an FCC investigation that showed he was alone at Central Florida Teleport at the time of the incident and a recording of the jamming video showed that the text was created by a character generator at that location. He was charged with transmitting without a radio license in violation of . MacDougall pleaded guilty and was fined $5,000 and served a year probation. Ambiguity about whether the 47 USC 301 charge was applicable since the transmitter had a license resulted in the passage of which made satellite jamming a felony.\n\nMacDougall was able to perform the intrusion while working a second job as a master control operator at a satellite teleport in Florida, where he worked to make ends meet due to declining income from his satellite TV equipment business. He stated that he did it because he was frustrated with HBO's service rates, and that it was hurting his business selling satellite dishes (hence his second job at the teleport). The message, placed over SMPTE color bars, broadcast by MacDougall read:\nPlayboy's satellite network was intentionally \"jammed\" with a text-only message on the night of Sunday, September 6, 1987. The message read, \"Thus sayeth the Lord thy God. Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy. Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\" (The verses were taken from Exodus 20:8 and Matthew 4:17 in the Bible.)\n\nThe white text and black background of the message prevented viewers from seeing the movie that Playboy was running at the time called \"Three Daughters\". (Playboy's feed was on RCA Satcom 4, transponder 24.)\n\nThomas Haynie of Virginia Beach, Virginia was convicted of satellite piracy in September 1990 in Norfolk, Virginia federal court in connection with the incident. Haynie was an uplink engineer at the Christian Broadcasting Network, a television ministry in Virginia Beach. He was on duty at the time of the jamming.\n\nAccording to investigators, it was the religious content of the transmission and the type of equipment used that drew them to CBN. The jamming signal left behind subtle technical clues that were captured on a VHS recording made at Playboy's uplink at the time of the event – like finding \"fingerprints\" in the video. After investigators were confident that they identified the brand of transmitter and character generator from the video, they concluded that CBN was the culprit.\nCBN maintained that the FCC's case was entirely circumstantial since there were no witnesses and the signal could not be traced to a point of origin. During the investigation, experts on both sides attempted to recreate the incident with CBN's equipment. According to CBN spokesman Dino McCann they were unsuccessful. Furthermore, CBN asserted that there was not enough power for Haynie to jam Playboy's signal but during the trial, government witnesses said the CBN station was capable of interfering with satellite transmissions.\n\nAfter initially being deadlocked, the jury eventually sided with the prosecution and convicted Haynie on two of six counts (Haynie was also accused of interfering with the American Exxxtacy channel on GTE Spacenet 1 on the same date; however, a recording of the event was of such poor quality that it was unusable and Haynie was acquitted of the associated charges). Haynie received three years of probation, a $1000 fine, and 150 hours of community service. Haynie has always maintained his innocence.\n\nOn November 22, 1987, an unidentified man wearing a Max Headroom mask appeared on the signals of two television stations in Chicago. Independent station WGN-TV, owned by Tribune Broadcasting, was hijacked first. The intrusion occurred during the sports report on its 9:00 pm newscast and lasted about 25 seconds. Then came PBS station WTTW, where the man was seen and heard uttering garbled remarks before dropping his trousers, partially exposing his buttocks, and was then spanked with a flyswatter before the screen went black. The next interception occurred at about 11:00 pm during an episode of the \"Doctor Who\" serial, \"Horror of Fang Rock\", and lasted almost 90 seconds. None of the individuals responsible for the intrusion have been identified. This incident got the attention of the CBS Evening News the next day and was talked about nationwide. The HBO incident was also mentioned in the same news report.\n\nIn September 1985, four astronomers at Poland's University of Toruń, Zygmunt Turło, Leszek Zaleski, Piotr Łukaszewski and Jan Hanasz, used a home computer, a synchronizing circuit, and a transmitter to superimpose messages in support of the labor movement Solidarność (Solidarity) over state-run television broadcasts in Toruń, including an episode of \"07 zgłoś się\". The messages read \"Dość podwyżek cen, kłamstw i represji. Solidarność Toruń\" (\"Enough price increases, lies, and repressions. Solidarity Toruń\") and \"Bojkot wyborów naszym obowiązkiem.\" (\"It is our duty to boycott the election\", referring to the rigged Sejm elections of 1985) with the Solidarity logo. The four men were eventually discovered and were charged with \"possession of an unlicensed radio transmitter and publication of materials that could cause public unrest\". At their sentencing, the judge noted their prize winning work in the Polish scientific community and gave each of them probation and a fine of the equivalent of US$100 each (or 3,000,000 old złoty, 300 PLN in today's currency).\n\nBroadcast signal intrusion was a common practice in the USSR during the 1970s and 1980s due to the absence of and high demand for any non-government broadcasting. As early as 1966, there was a report of an incident in the city of Kaluga where an 18 year old broadcast a hoax announcement that nuclear war had broken out with the United States.\n\nIn the mid-1970s so many pirates were operating around the city of Arkhangelsk, especially at night, that local people were urged to telephone reports of violators to a special number.\n\nHijackers using call signs such as \"cucumber\", \"Radio Millimeter\", \"Green Goat\", \"Fortune\", and others, would overpower the signal on relay stations for wired radio networks in order to transmit their own programming, or transmit into wired radio networks during gaps in normal programming. Even though the incidents appear to have been fairly common according to reports from the BBC, most were not publicly acknowledged for policy reasons. Reports in newspapers typically referred to the hijackers as \"radio hooligans broadcasting drivel, rudeness, vulgarity, uncensored expressions, and trashy music\". State news organizations also attempted smear campaigns against such pirate broadcasters, claiming that they had interfered with a state frequency used by Aeroflot, \"preventing a doctor in an air ambulance from transmitting information about a patient\".\n\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon War, Israel overloaded the satellite transmission of Hezbollah's Al Manar TV to broadcast anti-Hezbollah propaganda. One spot showed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah with crosshairs superimposed on his image followed by three gunshots and a voice saying \"Your day is coming\" and shots of the Israeli Air Force destroying targets in Lebanon.\n\nIn June and July 2017, Mansfield 103.2 FM, a local radio station in the UK, had its signal intruded at least eight times during outside broadcasts. During these intrusions, \"The Winker's Song (Misprint)\" was played. The perpetrator has not been identified.\n\nOn an unknown date in 1989, an advert on TVQ-10 in Brisbane, Australia was interrupted with interference from radio station FM104. \n\nOn January 3, 2007 in Australia, during a broadcast of an episode of the Canadian television series \"Mayday\" (known in Australia as \"Air Crash Investigation\") on the Seven Network, an audio signal unexpectedly started playing, clearly saying in an American accent, \"Jesus Christ, help us all, Lord.\" This same voice message continued to repeat itself over and over during the show for a total of six minutes. A spokesman for Seven later denied that the transmission was a prank or a security breach and claimed that the repeated line was actually part of the original broadcast and said, \"Jesus Christ, one of the Nazarenes\", although there is hardly any similarity between the two phrases. Subsequent investigation by independent researchers revealed that the invading transmission was actually from a videotaped news broadcast of a civilian truck being ambushed in Iraq. It remains unknown whether or not this was an intentional act of television piracy or a genuine glitch of some sort.\n\nOn June 17, 2007, an intrusion incident occurred on Czech Television's Sunday morning programme \"Panorama\", which shows panoramic shots of Prague and various locations across the country, especially mountain resorts. One of the cameras, located in Černý Důl in Krkonoše, had been tampered with on-site and its video stream was replaced with the hackers' own, which contained CGI of a small nuclear explosion in the local landscape, ending in white noise. The broadcast looked authentic enough; the only clue for the viewers was the Web address of the artist group Ztohoven, which had already performed several reality hacking incidents before. Czech Television considered legal action against the group, and tourism workers in the area expressed outrage (since the programme serves to promote tourism in the areas shown).\n\nOn July 13, 2007, a grainy photo of a man and woman interrupted Washington, D.C. ABC affiliate WJLA's digital or HD signal. The picture was not transmitted over the analog signal, however. The incident was deemed a genuine signal intrusion by various websites but has since been confirmed to be the result of an older HDTV encoder malfunctioning in the early morning hours and going undetected. Station management stated that the image was from an advertisement for \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\".\n\nOn February 11, 2013, Great Falls, Montana CBS affiliate KRTV had their Emergency Alert System hijacked with an audible message warning viewers that \"dead bodies are rising from their graves\". Later the same night in Marquette, Michigan, the same type of hijacking and reference to a \"zombie invasion\" was made over the EAS systems of ABC affiliate WBUP and PBS member station WNMU during primetime programming. Shortly afterwards, PBS affiliate KENW of Portales, New Mexico was struck with a similar hacking incident, repeating similar information regarding zombies; however, this led to the arrest of the hacker of the four television stations. The audio clip from this hack was also used in the track \"Fight 'Em 'Til You Can't\" by Anthrax.\n\nOn May 1, 2007, a Comcast headend replaced the Disney Channel's program \"Handy Manny\" with hard-core pornography for viewers in Lincroft, New Jersey. Comcast stated it was conducting an investigation into the event's cause but did not announce findings to the public.\n\nOn February 1, 2009, another Comcast headend, in Tucson, Arizona, replaced NBC affiliate KVOA's signal with graphic footage from the pornographic video \"Wild Cherries 5\" in portions of Arizona for ten seconds, interrupting Super Bowl XLIII between the Arizona Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Steelers during the fourth quarter. Comcast claimed \"Our initial investigation suggests this was an isolated malicious act. We are conducting a thorough investigation to determine who was behind this.\" KVOA also announced that it will be investigating the incident. On February 4, 2011, former Cox Cable employee Frank Tanori Gonzalez was arrested by the FBI and local police in relation to the case.\n\nOn April 20, 2012, three minutes of a gay pornographic film was broadcast during a morning news show on CHCH TV in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada for Shaw cable viewers. The night before, a cable was cut; while it was being fixed on the morning of the incident, the adult programming was spliced into CHCH's feed.\n\nOn September 18, 2012, the Disney Channel once again was interrupted on the Dish Network, replacing 6 minutes of \"Lilo & Stitch\" with a portion of a hardcore pornographic movie. The incident was reported to Dish Network.\n\nOn March 11, 2016, private satellite dish owners in Israel watching \"HaAh HaGadol\" on Channel 2 had their viewing of adventures of house-bound reality stars interrupted with incitement from Hamas. The disruption lasted a little over three and a half minutes.\n\nOn March 5, 2017, the broadcast of a Libyan television station was interrupted by Gaddafists.\n\n\n"}

Since the late 1970s, he has worked for a wide range of publications and broadcasters including \"NME\", LWT, the BBC and Talk Radio.\n\nBaker was born in Deptford in south east London to Fred \"Spud\" Baker, a dockworker, and Betty, a factory worker. He grew up in Bermondsey. He attended Rotherhithe Primary School and then instead of taking up a grammar school place he went to the nearby West Greenwich Secondary Boys School, Deptford. He left the school in April 1972 at the age of 14 and initially worked in One Stop Records, a small but fashionable record shop in South Molton Street in the West End of London. The youngest of three children, he has an older sister, Sharon, and had an older brother, Michael, who died aged 29 when Danny was 24.\n\nIn 1977, Baker started writing for the punk fanzine \"Sniffin' Glue\" which was founded by his old schoolfriend Mark Perry which in turn led to an offer from the \"New Musical Express\", then edited by Nick Logan. Baker began working as the office receptionist, but was soon contributing regular articles and reviews before progressing to interviews. He often refers to these times during his radio shows, regularly citing examples of the ridiculous behaviour exhibited by his rock star interviewees.\n\nIn the later 1990s, Baker wrote a weekly sports column for \"The Times\" and was briefly a columnist for early issues of film magazine \"Empire\".\n\nBaker started his TV career in 1980 at London Weekend Television (LWT), as the presenter of \"Twentieth Century Box\" - a series of regional documentaries on elements of youth culture in London, produced by Janet Street Porter. One edition in the first series documented the burgeoning new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) scene, including an early TV appearance of Iron Maiden performing at The Marquee Club and interviews with \"air guitarists\". Other editions also featured early appearances from the likes of Spandau Ballet and Depeche Mode.\n\nBaker's first mainstream break was as roving reporter-presenter on the Michael Aspel LWT regional magazine \"The Six O'Clock Show\" alongside former \"Mastermind\" winner and former London black cab driver Fred Housego. Paul Ross (brother of Jonathan Ross whom Baker had as his best man) was his researcher. During his stint on \"The Six O'Clock Show\", Baker was filmed having an altercation with a British Rail press officer. This clip is often resurrected for clip shows and can be seen on YouTube.\n\nBaker appeared regularly on LWT's regional output during the 1980s and early 1990s - working on such programmes as \"Six O'Clock Live\", \"Danny Baker's Londoners\", and in 1991, \"The Game\" - a six-part series which featured coverage of teams involved in the fourth division of the East London Sunday Football League. The series was later released on DVD.\n\nBaker began writing for television programmes in 1992 after being asked to prepare a piece for one of the first archive clip shows: \"TV Hell\", which was a collection of the worst TV programmes ever. Since then he has presented television shows such as \"Win, Lose, or Draw\", \"Pets Win Prizes\" and \"TV Heroes\", which was a series of 10-minute homages to some of Baker's entertainment idols including Fanny Cradock, Peter Glaze (from \"Crackerjack\") and the \"Top of the Pops\" audience. In one episode of \"TV Heroes\", a clip was shown of Baker leaping around to a performance of \"Ooh What A Life\" by the Gibson Brothers in 1979, which was captioned as \"Danny Baker's first TV appearance\". During an edition of his own later series \"TV Heroes\" featuring the audiences from Top Of The Pops, Baker described himself as \"looking like he was trying to put out a small fire\".\n\nBaker also began a BBC Saturday night chat show, called \"Danny Baker After All\" which borrowed its style from \"Late Night with David Letterman\", but his style and guests (Rick Wakeman of prog rock band Yes was a regular) did not attract the mainstream audience the slot demanded. Film critic Mark Kermode's band The Railtown Bottlers was the show's house band.\n\nLater he fronted television adverts for Daz washing powder and Mars bar confectionery. Baker parodied his Daz ads by appearing as himself on the sitcom \"Me, You and Him\".\n\nDuring this period, Baker began presenting on BBC Radio 5's \"606\" football-related phone-in programme as well as the job of presenting \"Match of the Eighties\", a six-part BBC series of football during the 1980/81 and 1985/86 seasons.\n\nBaker was a writer on Chris Evans' \"TFI Friday\" show, as well as contributing material for presenters such as Angus Deayton and Jonathan Ross.\n\nDuring the late 1990s he made guest appearances on comedy shows including \"Have I Got News for You\", \"Shooting Stars\" and \"Room 101\". During this period he appeared in the press as a result of nights out with friends Chris Evans and England footballer Paul Gascoigne. Gascoigne was under media scrutiny for drinking and socialising while preparing for tournaments. After Gascoigne was left out of the 1998 World Cup squad, Baker went on \"Have I Got News For You\" to defend his friend and criticise the omission.\n\nHe also appeared on \"The Terry and Gaby Show\" from 2003 to 2004 (where he burnt his hand trying to perform a trick with a microwave and a piece of soap) and has appeared on BBC Two quiz show \"QI\", becoming the show's first ever winner. Baker worked again with Charles Shaar Murray on the Ramones documentary \"End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones\", providing an audio commentary.\n\nMore recent TV projects include \"The Sitcom Showdown\" which began on UKTV Gold in April 2006, a 2014 show featuring archived television footage for BBC4 named \"Brushing Up On...\" and a music discussion show for BBC4 named \"Danny Baker's Rockin' Decades\". He also did \"Comic Relief Does The Apprentice\" in 2007 for Comic Relief. He also starred in \"The Rocky Horror Show\", as the narrator, at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley and the New Wimbledon Theatre.\n\nBaker was announced as part of BT Sport's football coverage in 2013, hosting a Friday evening show with Danny Kelly. In 2016, Chris Evans hired Baker to work as a writer on the 2016 series of \"Top Gear\". In November 2016, he entered as a latecomer in reality television show, \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here\", along with Martin Roberts. Baker was the first person to be voted off in the series.\n\nBaker began his radio career on BBC GLR in 1989, presenting \"Weekend Breakfast\" from 6 to 9am on Saturdays and Sundays. The show was produced by Chris Evans, who became a good friend to Baker. With GLR eventually opting for a more orthodox breakfast show at weekends, Baker moved to the 10am to 1pm slot on Sundays.\n\nIn 1990, Baker joined the newly launched BBC Radio 5, presenting \"Sportscall\", a phone-in sports quiz broadcast every Saturday lunchtime.\n\nFrom October 1991 to October 1992 he presented \"606\" and, from February 1992 until October 1993, he presented \"Morning Edition\" from 6:30 to 9:30am every weekday morning. The show blended Baker's love of unusual trivia with 'grown-up' music. This was where Baker first teamed up with Danny Kelly and Allis Moss. Mark Kermode added weekly film reviews, and would later appear with his band 'The Railtown Bottlers' every week on the first series of Baker's TV show.\n\nBaker joined BBC Radio 1 in October 1993, taking over the weekend mid-morning show from 10am to 1pm from Dave Lee Travis who had resigned on air following the sackings instigated by Matthew Bannister and Trevor Dann during the early 1990s. However, due to poor ratings, from November 1994 he was heard on Saturdays only from 10am to 12 noon. Simon Mayo took over Sunday mornings.\n\nBaker's style led to a fall in listeners at Radio 1 but despite his tendering his resignation on at least two occasions, management added extensions to his contract. From October 1995, his Saturday show went out from 12:30 to 2:30pm. He left the station in September 1996. His co-hosts during this period included BBC continuity announcer Allis Moss, Dr. H, Laurie Sore, Andy Darling and Danny Kelly.\n\nWhile continuing with his Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 1, in 1996 Baker joined BBC Radio 5 Live to present a Sunday lunchtime show with Danny Kelly, \"Baker & Kelly Upfront\".\n\nOn leaving BBC Radio 1, Baker returned to BBC GLR to present a three-hour Sunday show from 10am to 1pm. 'Baker and Kelly Upfront' also returned, now at Saturday lunchtime, while Baker also took on a new show, 'The Baker Line', a Wednesday evening version of the \"606\" phone-in show.\n\nWhile 'Baker and Kelly Upfront' was light-hearted, 'The Baker Line' was darker and emotionally charged. Baker was at his most outspoken, and in early 1997, he was sacked from 5 Live when station bosses alleged that he had incited threatening behaviour during an angry outburst about a referee.\n\nBaker joined Talk Radio to present a similar football phone-in with Kelly each Saturday from 5:30 to 7:30pm. A pre-match show was added from 11:30am to 1pm. After moving to the Saturday breakfast slot (8am to 12 noon), he engineered his own dismissal after a matter of weeks by refusing to centre the show on football, preferring to intersperse chat with his own music selections.\n\nAfter leaving Talk Radio, he joined Virgin Radio in early 1999, taking over from Jonathan Ross on Sundays from 10am to 1pm.\n\nNot long after, Baker was approached by the BBC and was asked whether he wanted to present a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 2. Baker turned down the offer by saying \"the time wasn't right\", and the show was given to Ross. Baker also deputised on Virgin's Saturday lunchtime football show from 12 noon to 2pm for a handful of shows, alongside Danny Kelly until he left the station in 2000.\n\nIn September 2001, Baker joined BBC London 94.9 presenting a Saturday morning show from 8 to 11am. Just 6 months later, in March 2002, and with a new co-presenting team which included Amy Lamé, Mark O'Donnell and David Kuo, he took over the breakfast show from 6 to 9am, with a new theme tune in the form of the Anthony Newley song \"The Candy Man\".\n\nAlthough not drawing a large listenership, Baker won \"Sony Radio DJ of the year\" for the show. However, the day after winning the award, he announced his intention to leave the show at the end of the month. The last show was on Friday 27 May 2005. On Monday 17 October 2005, after a sabbatical at home, Baker rejoined BBC London 94.9 where he took over the weekday 3 to 5pm show from Jono Coleman, who had moved to co-present the breakfast show with former actress JoAnne Good.\n\nHis BBC London 94.9 shows tended to feature off-the-wall phone-ins and discussions with his on-air team, Amy and Baylen Leonard, often regarding music and entertainment nostalgia of the 1960s and 1970s. His interviews focused on off-beat trivia rather than the guests' latest or most famous work, and shows would be interspersed with relatively obscure rock tracks from bands such as Yes, Todd Rundgren, Steely Dan, Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart.\n\nThe programme was axed in November 2012 as part of a programme of cuts at the station. Although due to continue its run until the end of the year, Baker announced on air on the day of the announcement that that day's show would be his last, branding his BBC London employers as \"pinheaded weasels\" for the way in which they cancelled the programme.\n\nOn 15 March 2007 until September the same year, Baker hosted the \"All Day Breakfast Show\", a podcast to reach listeners beyond BBC London's FM radio reach. Regulars Amy Lamé, Baylen Leonard and David Kuo all contributed and the first show featured an appearance by comedian and actor Peter Kay.\n\nHaving announced on his BBC London radio show on 21 May 2008 that he would be returning to present BBC Radio 5 Live's \"606\" football phone-in for a limited period that summer, Baker hosted six shows during Euro 2008. He made a long-term return to \"606\" in September 2008, hosting a Tuesday night show for the duration of the 200809 football season. He also had a short stint with Zoë Ball on Radio 2 on Saturday mornings after Jonathan Ross had been suspended for three months by the BBC. At the end of the 200809 season, Baker's \"606\" Tuesday night show that he co-hosted with Issy Clarke shifted to an expanded Saturday morning slot, starting in September 2009 on BBC 5 Live. The show returned in September 2010 after the summer break with Lynsey Hipgrave replacing Clarke as co-host. The Saturday Morning show gained critical acclaim, winning the Gold Sony Radio Award in the Speech Radio Personality of the Year award for the 2011, 2012 and 2014, and the Gold Award for the Entertainment Show of the Year in 2013.\n\nSince (July 2016) Louise Pepper has been his co-host in the studio. A popular feature of the Saturday Morning Programme is the Sausage Sandwich Game. A celebrity guest is asked two questions about their personal life that only they can answer. Two contestants representing local or national football teams, score 'goals' based on their ability to correctly guess the celebrity's answer. In the final question which gives the game its name, the contestants have to guess if the celebrity when offered a sausage sandwich would choose red sauce, brown sauce or no sauce at all.\nThe second hour of the programme features a (different) celebrity interview followed by phone-in led banter.\n\nBaker has presented a number of popular football videos and DVDs including \"Own Goals and Gaffs\" (1992), \"Right Hammerings\", \"Whose Season Was It Anyway?\" (both 1993), \"Own Goals and Gaffs 2\" (1994), \"Fabulous World Of Freak Football\" (1995) and \"The Glorious Return Of Own Goals And Gaffs\" (2009).\n\n\"The Game\" (1990), a cult classic television show presented by Baker, following bottom-division East London Sunday League football teams, was released on DVD through Revelation Films on 24 May 2010.\n\nIn 2009, he released a book co-written with Danny Kelly entitled \"Classic Football Debates Settled Once and for All, Vol. 1\". Despite the title, the book itself makes clear that a sequel is not planned, though some extra material was written for the paperback edition, released to coincide with the 2010 World Cup.\n\nOn 6 November 2012, Baker released an autobiography, \"Going to Sea in a Sieve\". which was first published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson. A second volume entitled \"Going Off Alarming\" was published on 25 September 2014. A third volume entitled \"Going on the Turn\" was published on 5 October 2017.\n\nA sitcom called \"Cradle to Grave\" based on \"Going To Sea In A Sieve\" was released in September 2015.\n\nHis interests range as widely as the United States, progressive rock, Steely Dan, Disney, the Marx Brothers and P. G. Wodehouse. He has a large collection of vinyl records and a collection of redundant laserdiscs that his family refer to as 'Baker's folly'.\n\nBaker is a lifelong supporter of his local football club, Millwall.\n\nBaker is married to Wendy (born 7 March 1955) They have three children: Bonnie, Sonny and Mancie. He lives in Blackheath, south east London.\n\nOn 1 November 2010, Baker announced that he had been diagnosed with cancer and would start chemotherapy instantly and radiotherapy in January. On 14 June 2011 he announced that he had been given the all clear.\n\nBaker has been a lifelong Labour Party activist. In May 2017, Baker endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election.\n\n"}

With considerable financial support from local philanthropists Jannie and Christiaan Marais, purchased a quarter of 20,000 ₤1 shares in the new holding company, the project soon got off the ground, with the founding of \"De Nasionale Pers\" (\"the National Press\") and the selection of Dr. D. F. Malan as editor of its daily paper, \"De Burger\" (Dutch for \"The Citizen\"). The first issue was published on 26 July 1915.\n\n\"Die Burger\" was originally published in Dutch. In 1916, the first Afrikaans-language articles were published. In 1921, the newspaper's Dutch title (\"De Burger\") was translated into Afrikaans (\"Die Burger\").\n\n\n\"Die Burger\" was a newspaper that supported the nationalist cause and apartheid, and used to be the mouthpiece of the National Party of South Africa. This only began to change after 1985, when then editor Piet Cillié, a staunch supporter of the government under B. J. Vorster and P. W. Botha, retired. In 1990, the National Party was officially informed by editor Ebbe Dommisse that it no longer served as a political mouthpiece. This disaffiliation was continued in 1999 with the appointment of a more progressive editor, Arrie Rossouw. In 2006, Henry Jeffreys became the first cape coloured editor of the paper.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The areas which were worst affected were the Swedish province of Finland and Norrland in Sweden proper.\n\nIn the Swedish province of Finland, the Great Famine of 1695–97 was also referred to as \"The Years of Many Deaths\" by some Finnish historians, because it killed about a third of the Finnish population in only two years, or about 150,000. It was Finland's worst demographic catastrophe.\n\nFrom 1688 onward, Sweden had been affected by early frost and bad harvests. This culminated in the winter of 1695, which was described as the coldest since 1658 and the rye did not flower before July. Because of this, the Great Famine of 1695 is also referred to as \"Det stora svartåret\" (\"The Great Black Year\"). The harvest of 1696, furthermore, was reportedly so bad that each farm produced only one loaf of rye bread.\nOutside of Finland, the northernmost provinces of Sweden were the most severely affected.

Youth organizations, governments, and civil society are encouraged to organize activities that promote an increased understanding of the importance and benefits of youth participation in all aspects of society, as well as those that support youth to devote their energy, enthusiasm and creativity to development and the promotion of mutual understanding. It encourages young people to dedicate themselves to fostering progress, including the attainment of the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which seek to slash a host of social inadequacies, ranging from extreme poverty and hunger to maternal and infant mortality to lack of access to education and health care, all by 2015.\n\nUnder the theme \"Dialogue and Mutual Understanding\", the resolution aims to encourage dialogue and understanding across generations and promote the ideals of peace, respect for human rights and freedoms, and solidarity.\n\nIn its resolution 64/134, the UN General Assembly decided “to organize under the auspices of the United Nations a world youth conference as the highlight of the Year” and invited “the President of the General Assembly to conduct open-ended information consultations with Member States with a view of determining the modalities of the conference, which is to be funded by voluntary contributions.”\n\nIn April 2010, H.E. Mr Jean-Francis Régis Zinsou, the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Benin, agreed to serve as Facilitator for the consultations on the organization of the conference to be held in 2011. Consultations of the General Assembly began in May 2010.\n\nIn addition to the UN conference on youth, the UN is coordinating its efforts to celebrate and promote International Year of Youth. The United Nations Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development is coordinating the activities of the UN system for the International Year of Youth, with the UN Programme on Youth leading this effort. The United Nations Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development works to increase the effectiveness of UN work in youth development by strengthening collaboration and exchange among all UN entities working on youth.\n\nMembers of the Network adopted the UN Framework Approach for the International Year of Youth in February, 2010, to provide a concrete framework for collective efforts and to set the strategic objectives for the Year. The Framework identifies three key objectives and provides specific actions essential to implement the objectives, which are:\n\n1. Create Awareness: increase commitment and investment in youth\n\n2. Mobilize and Engage: increase youth participation and partnerships\n\n3. Connect and Build Bridges: increase intercultural understanding among youth\n\nThe progress achieved during the Year will lay the foundation for further work in youth development, including the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The Framework has been disseminated to the UN system, including to Regional Commissions and Country Teams. Organizations celebrating the Year are invited to use the Framework to guide their activities.\n\nIn 1965, United Nations Members States first acknowledged that the contribution of young people – defined by the United Nations as those between the ages of 15 and 24 years – is essential for the development of society when they endorsed the \"Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace, Mutual Respect and Understanding between Peoples\". \n\nTwenty years later, the General Assembly observed the year 1985 as the \"first International Youth Year: Participation, Development and Peace\". In 1995, Member States strengthened their commitment to young people by adopting the \"World Programme of Action for Youth (WPAY)\", which provides a policy framework and practical guidelines for national action and international support to improve the situation of young people by increasing their access to opportunities for constructive participation in society. \n\nIn 2007, the General Assembly expanded upon the WPAY by adopting additional issue areas, bringing the total to fifteen areas of priority focus which are: education, employment, hunger and poverty, health, environment, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency, leisure-time activities, girls and young women, participation, globalization, information and communications technologies, HIV/AIDS, youth and conflict, and inter-generational relations.\n\nInternational Years are customarily celebrated at the national level and steered by National Committees, usually consisting of government entities such as Ministry of Youth or Ministry of Education, National Youth Councils, civil society organizations, representatives of the UN system and other relevant stakeholders.\n\n"}

It lasted until 17 June 1944 when a national referendum established the Republic of Iceland in its place.\n\nBecause of the Kalmar Union, Iceland had been under the control of the Crown of Denmark since 1380, although formally it had been a Norwegian possession until 1814. In 1874, one thousand years after the first acknowledged settlement, Denmark granted Iceland home rule. The constitution, written the same year, was revised in 1903 and the extent of Iceland's home rule increased in 1904. A minister for Icelandic affairs, residing in Reykjavík, was made responsible to the \"Althing\", the Icelandic parliament.\n\nOn 1 December 1918, the Act of Union, an agreement with Denmark, recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign state, an independent country in personal union with Denmark through a common monarch. The Kingdom of Iceland established its own flag and coat of arms and asked that Denmark represent its foreign affairs and defence interests on its behalf while retaining full control over its foreign affairs and defence. Iceland opened its first Embassy in 1920. The Act would be reviewed in 1940 and could be revoked three years later if agreement to continue it could not be reached.\n\nThe German occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940 severed communications between Iceland and Denmark. As a result, on 10 April, the Althing passed two resolutions investing the Icelandic cabinet with the power of head of state and declaring that Iceland would accept full responsibility for both foreign policy and coastal surveillance. A year later, on 15 May 1941 the Althing adopted a law creating the position of regent for Sveinn Björnsson in order to represent the monarchy. During the first year of World War II, Iceland strictly enforced a position of neutrality and took action against both British and German forces that violated it. On 10 May 1940, Operation \"Fork\" was launched by the United Kingdom when military forces sailed into Reykjavík harbour and began an invasion of Iceland. The government of Iceland issued a protest against what it called a \"flagrant violation\" of Icelandic neutrality. On the day of the invasion, Prime Minister Hermann Jónasson read a radio announcement instructing Icelanders to treat the British troops as guests. The Allied occupation of Iceland lasted until 1941 when the Government of Iceland asked the United States to take over its defence. The defence of Iceland was the United States' first participation in World War II.\n\nAt its peak, Britain had approximately 25,000 troops stationed in Iceland, all but eliminating unemployment in Reykjavík and other strategically important places. In July 1941, the \"Althingi\" adopted the American–Icelandic defence agreement, passing responsibility for Iceland's defence to the United States. As many as 40,000 American soldiers were then stationed on the island, outnumbering the native population of adult men.

He declared himself James I, Prince of Trinidad, and intended for the islands to become a military dictatorship under his leadership. Britain and Brazil later argued over the territory, and it is now a part of the state of Espírito Santo in southeastern Brazil.\n\nThe original name of the island, \"Trindade\", is Portuguese for \"trinity\"; \"Trinidad\" is the Spanish cognate. It is unclear why Harden-Hickley chose to translate the name from Portuguese into Spanish, and not English. Earlier, nearby Ascension Island had been renamed from its original Portuguese name \"Ascensão\" when it passed into British hands.\n\nWhile traveling to Tibet before his marriage, Harden-Hickey noticed the tiny island of Trindade in the South Atlantic Ocean, which had never been claimed by any country and was, legally, \"terra nullius\". In 1893, wanting an independent state where he could serve as its ruler, he claimed the island and proclaimed himself James I, the Prince of Trinidad. \n\nHe designed postage stamps, a national flag and coat of arms, and established a chivalric order, the Cross of Trinidad. He bought a schooner to transport colonists, appointed M. Le Comte De la Boissiere as Secretary of State, and opened a consular office at 217 West 36th Street in New York City. He issued government bonds to finance the construction of infrastructure on the island.\n\nIn July 1895, the British tried to take possession of the island, basing their claim on the 1700 visit by English astronomer Edmund Halley. The British planned to use the island as a telegraph cable station. However, Brazilian diplomatic efforts, along with Portuguese support, pressed a successful claim to Brazilian sovereignty, based on the island's discovery in 1502 by Portuguese navigators.\n\nTo demonstrate sovereignty over the island, the state of Espírito Santo, which took the island, built a landmark on January 24, 1897.\nToday, Brazil marks its presence with a permanent Brazilian Navy base on the main island.\n"}

Produced by amateur filmmakers in Hong Kong, it was posted to YouTube in June 2013. The name of the film originates from Snowden's codename for himself, which means \"truth teller\" in Latin. It was produced by the group J.Shot Videos. According to the producers, this was the first film ever produced about Snowden.\n\nThe film has four parts. The first depicts Central Intelligence Agency employees discussing the Snowden case. The second involves a newspaper journalist corresponding with Snowden. The third involves Hong Kong police officers and Chinese Ministry of State Security employees discussing and trying to find Edward Snowden. The fourth involves the characters waiting for Snowden to appear, and when Snowden reveals himself in the media. The end of the film includes extracts of Snowden's interview with \"The Guardian\". The final captions state that Snowden departed Hong Kong on 23 June. The film features The Mira, the Hong Kong hotel where Snowden stayed. A Rubik's cube, an item which, according to the \"Agence France-Presse\", \"Snowden reportedly used to identify himself to a \"Guardian\" journalist,\" is featured in the film. Marcus Tsui, one of the project's filmmakers, described the film as a \"snapshot in time\".\n\nAndreas Wiseman of \"Screen Daily\" wrote that the plot uses \"a large degree of creative licence\".\n\nThe film was created by expatriates from Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United States. The producers of the film were Jeff Floro, Edwin Lee, Shawn Tse, and Marcus Tsui. Lee, an Irish citizen, and the sole professional filmmaker involved, served as the editor and cinematographer. Lee had served as a journalist in the multimedia and television sectors and had worked for the \"South China Morning Post\" and ATV Home. On 11 July 2013, two days after Snowden revealed his identity, Edwin Lee had contacted his friends on the possibility of making a film. Lee and Tsui created the film's script, and did so one day before shooting. The actors had no time to rehearse their lines.\n\nAccording to the producers, the film was intended to be an homage to Hong Kong. Lee said \"We were so intrigued as to why Snowden came to Hong Kong. All of us love Hong Kong to death; we all call Hong Kong home.\" The filmmakers, on the group YouTube page, stated \"While nearly every media outlet wanted to get their hands on him, we decided to produce a short fiction video to depict his experience in HK, and how it would have affected certain parties. Namely, the CIA contingent based in HK who would be tasked to find Snowden. The Hong Kong police who would be stuck in between the U.S. and China, and the journalists who want to get the scoop.\" Lee said that the film was created \"to catch onto the interest on Snowden and the attention on Hong Kong.\" According to Tse, a then 28-year-old native of Toronto, Ontario and a graduate of the York University film studies programme who worked as a teacher in Hong Kong, \"We tried to give Hong Kong the limelight we think it deserves.\" Tse said that the group had initially considered an outright comedy, a spoof, or a thriller in the style of Jason Bourne; ultimately they opted for a depiction of the events that may have unfolded. Lee said that the Bourne film series and the works of director Michael Mann had inspired him.\n\nIn regards to Snowden's presence, the filmmakers stated that while Snowden is \"a central character, he is not the most prominent. It is more about the maelstrom of events surrounding him.\" This was because they knew too little about Snowden himself to give him a more prominent role in the story. Lee said that the film focuses more on the \"vignettes\" than on Snowden and that Snowden serves as a catalyst for events that affect the other characters. Snowden himself has no live dialogue in the film. Lee said that half of the film's focus was on Hong Kong, and half was on Snowden.\n\nThe four filmmakers stated that they had no political motives. Shawn Tse said that \"We knew right from the get-go that this film was going to be as neutral as possible and in a way try not to infringe upon basically what we thought Snowden was trying to do, because really we had no idea.\" Lee described the film as a \"snapshot in time\" and said that \"When Snowden popped up in Hong Kong he got so much attention that it really got people talking. We wanted to give an alternative view on the situation, beyond the media chase for where he was and what he knew.\" Cassandra Chan, who served as the associate producer, said \"The US government has abused the internet, so our response is to use the power of the internet, for hopefully good reasons.\"\n\nDean Napolitano of \"The Wall Street Journal\" wrote that the film \"makes subtle observations about Hong Kong's sometimes tense relationship with mainland China and the \"one country, two systems\" policy – underscored in a scene where a security official from China's central government barks orders to Hong Kong police officers.\" During the aforementioned scene, the official from the Mainland speaks Mandarin while the Hong Kong officials speak Cantonese. According to Napolitano, the film implies that the Chinese authorities have the real power in Hong Kong. Lee stated that the scene was \"vehicle to represent (Hong Kong's) relationship with China\" and, as paraphrased by Alexis Lai of \"CNN\", \"the murkiness of Beijing's role in the Snowden affair.\" In regards to the scene, Lee said \"To say China wasn't pulling any strings at all would be naïve ... Even though it gives us autonomy, it's always Beijing that calls the shots.\" Officially officials from the Mainland government said that they did not influence the decisions of the Hong Kong authorities.\n\nBy 1 July 2013 Edwin Lee said that because Snowden left Hong Kong, there are no plans to write a sequel. By 29 July 2013, the filmmakers had plans to show their film at film festivals, and considered making a sequel.\n\nThe film was shot in three, or four days. At the time of shooting, Snowden was hiding within Hong Kong. By the end of the film production, Snowden had fled to Russia. Edwin Lee said that this quickened the editing process so the film could be released sooner, but that it did not shorten the project itself. \"Agence France-Presse\" stated that the film \"stayed true to the actual locations in Hong Kong where Snowden was reportedly seen.\" Some scenes were shot at The Mira Hotel. Several office interiors were used for other scenes. A lingerie company let the filmmakers use their offices.\n\nEdwin Lee, one of the filmmakers said that the filming style was \"a lot of adrenaline... it was all very guerilla filmmaking style.\" He also stated that \"It was foot-on-the-gas filmmaking.\" Lee described the filming style as a \"docu-drama recreation.\" Napolitano said that \"In some ways it resembles a modern Hong Kong crime drama, with its technical dialogue in sterile conference rooms, time-lapse photography, and sweeping aerial shots of the city's famous skyline.\" Jonathan DeHart of \"The Diplomat\" stated that the usage of time-lapse-style footage of grey clouds, the Hong Kong panoramas, and the \"shaky cam\" style are features of \"spy\" genre films. The film used original photography with the exception of two stock photography shots purchased from Pond5.\n\nAs of 28 June 2013 the filmmakers had not yet determined the total cost of the film. Their estimate of the budget was about $5,000 Hong Kong dollars ($641 US dollars). The AFP said that this budget was \"shoestring\". Patrick Frater of \"Variety\" stated on 1 June 2013 that the total cost was $4,200 HKD ($550 US). Adam Withnall of \"The Belfast Telegraph\" said that the budget was $645 U.S. dollars or about £420 British pounds. A one-night stay at The Mira was the most expensive single item in the budget, and made up about one third of the budget. The filmmakers stated that they did not make the film to gain a return on their investment, and Jeff Floro, who works in finance as a day job, said that he lost money on the film.\n\nDean Napolitano of \"The Wall Street Journal\" wrote that \"The film is not quite a \"Saturday Night Live\"-style spoof, but neither is it a slick thriller given its cast of non-actors and micro budget.\" Rebecca Keegan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that \"Verax\" \"feels quite polished for an insta-film\" due to the presence of electronic music soundtrack that she likens to the soundtrack of \"The Social Network\", the \"sweeping views of Hong Kong skyscrapers\" and the shots within The Mira Hotel. Keegan added that \"the actors' leaden delivery sometimes gives their neophyte status away.\" \"The Voice of Russia\" stated that the \"shaky camera work\" and the usage of local actors was \"reminiscent of the Bourne spy thriller series.\" Patrick Frater of \"Variety\" said that the film had \"strong production values, driving music and somewhat more amateurish acting performances.\" Alexis Lai of \"CNN\" said that the film \"is surprisingly suspenseful and sophisticated, with gorgeous time-lapse panoramas of the city and \"shaky cam\" shots reminiscent of Hollywood.\"\n\nThe cast of the film consisted of friends of the four filmmakers. Dean Napolitano of \"The Wall Street Journal\" said that the cast had \"varying degrees of thespian abilities\". Andrew Cromeek, a 25-year-old American from Chester, New York who was an English teacher, took the role as Snowden. He had previously acted in one commercial and one student film. The filmmakers had reviewed any friends of theirs who they believed \"remotely\" appeared similar to Snowden. Shawn Tse said that he looked at all of his Caucasian (White) friends to see who could play Snowden. Cromeek worked at a company where Tse worked as a teacher. Tse believed that Cromeek was \"going to be perfect\" for Snowden while Cromeek believed that he had \"zero resemblance\" to Snowden.\n\nAccording to Tse, he let Cromeek grow his beard out for several days before taking him to a Hong Kong barbershop. Cromeek gave the hairstylist a photograph of Snowden and received a haircut for 50 Hong Kong dollars (US$6.41). According to Tse the Hong Kong hairstylist warned Cromeek to be careful about being mistaken for Snowden. Cromeek then lightened his haircolor by using gold spray paint, put on eyeglasses, trimmed his beard, and on the day of the shooting had moles placed on his neck with makeup. The film team also used a special wardrobe to make Cromeek appear like Snowden. Cromeek reported that his parents, family members, and friends gave him telephone calls after the film was made public.\n\nCast list:\n\nThe film was released on YouTube on Tuesday 25 June 2013. Several publications contacted the filming group for interviews, with \"The Wall Street Journal\" being the first and the \"Agence France-Presse\" (AFP) and the \"Los Angeles Times\" doing so afterwards. The interviews increased interest in the film. By 28 June, it got over 5,000 views, and by 30 June it had gained over 8,500 views. By 2 July it got over 89,000 views. By 16 July it received over 220,000 hits. By 30 July it received almost 250,000 views.\n\nLuke Buckmaster of the online Australian political news magazine \"Crikey\" stated that \"Verax\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"greatest asset is its showcase of narrative efficiency; of getting key points across using the language and arrangement of images to solicit logical (not necessarily emotional responses) and doing so without needing to put too fine a point on it.\" Jin Jiabao of \"China Central Television\" said that the film's events were \"vividly portrayed\".\n\nStephanie Ip of the \"Associated Press\" wrote that the film initially gained popularity but by 29 July 2013, \"praise of the film has given way to criticism, with many viewers berating the four directors for amateur work and bad casting.\" Adam Withnall wrote in \"The Belfast Telegraph\" that \"many have criticised the four directors for amateur work and bad casting\" and in \"The Independent\" that \"a wider international audience hasn't been so forgiving of its less-than-professional quirks.\" The cast of the television program \"New Day\" said \"We hope [Andrew Cromeek] and the rest of the cast are better at their real jobs.\"\n\nIn regards to the criticism, Andrew Cromeek argued that the filmmakers did not expect to gain a large amount of attention on YouTube and that the filmmakers were not professional. Cromeek said \"I think the way it was shot was quite cool. We are all amateur actors. We all had one take. It was kind of like, shoot, go, OK, done. So it's fine. It's completely OK if people are like, 'It's the worst acting in the world.' It's totally fine with me.\" Ip wrote that \"Verax\" \"is a source of pride for the friends who made it, even as they acknowledge its limitations.\"\n\n\n"}

This was the second appearance of a Greek artist on the Eurovision stage after Jimmy Makulis in 1961. Greece as a nation would not join the Contest until 1974.\n\nMouskouri had had her international breakthrough with the German language single \"Weiße Rosen aus Athen\" (\"White Roses from Athens\") in 1961, a song originally adapted from a Greek folk melody. The song was later translated into several different languages and went on to become one of Mouskouri's signature tunes. When she received the offer to represent Luxembourg at the Eurovision Song Contest in early 1963 she and her family had recently relocated from Athens, Greece to Paris, France, where she was signed to the Philips-Fontana label.\n\n\"À force de prier\" is a ballad, with Mouskouri telling the object of her affections that she intends to have him love her \"by persistently praying\" for this to occur. Moskouri recorded her entry in French, German (as \"Die Worte dieser Nacht\"), English (\"The One That Got Away\") and Italian (\"La notte non lo sa\").\n\nThe song was performed sixteenth on the night, following Monaco's Françoise Hardy with \"L'amour s'en va\". At the close of voting, it had received 13 points, placing 8th in a field of 16.\n\nAlthough \"À force de prier\" was only a minor international success for Mouskouri, it won her the prestigious Grand Prix du Disque in France that same year, and her Eurovision appearance also caught the attention of noted French composer Michel Legrand, who went on to write and arrange two major hits for her in the francophone markets; \"Les parapluies de Cherbourg\" (1964) and \"L'enfant au tambour\" (1965).\n\n\"À force de prier\" was succeeded as Luxembourgian representative at the 1964 Contest by Hugues Aufray with \"Dès que le printemps revient\".\n\n"}
