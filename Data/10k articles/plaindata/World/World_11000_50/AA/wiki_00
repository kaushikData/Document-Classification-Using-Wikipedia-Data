It is raised mainly in the Val Camonica, the Val Saviore and the mountains of Brescia; some are found in neighbouring areas of the provinces of Bergamo to the west and Trento to the east. It was in the past known simply as the Capra Bionda or as the Mustàscia. \n\nThe breed appears to be of ancient origin. While it shares some characteristics with the Swiss Toggenburger, notably the \"Swiss markings\" (white facial stripes, white lower limbs and peri-anal area), it was already established well before the importation of Toggenburg billies to the area, documented from the years before and after the Second World War. A painting from about 1760 by the Milanese painter Francesco Londonio (1723–1786) shows a goat of Bionda dell'Adamello type, with typical coat and facial markings. \n\nThe Bionda dell'Adamello is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders.

It is operated by the government of Nunavut. It hosts scheduled passenger service from Ottawa, Montreal, Rankin Inlet, and Kuujjuaq on carriers such as First Air and Canadian North, and from smaller communities throughout eastern Nunavut. It is also used as a forward operating base by the CF-18 Hornet. In 2011, the terminal handled more than 120,000 passengers.\n\nThe airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle general aviation aircraft only, with no more than 15 passengers.\n\nThe airport serves as a diversion airport on polar routes.\n\nThe airport is owned by the Government of Nunavut (GN) and operated, under a 30-year contract, by Nunavut Airport Services. The company is a subsidiary of Winnipeg Airport Services Corporation, which in turn is a subsidiary of Winnipeg Airports Authority.\n\nDuring late July 1941, a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) team headed by Captain Elliott Roosevelt investigated the Frobisher Bay region for a potential airport for use in trans-Atlantic air traffic. Roosevelt's report designated a marginal site at Cape Rammelsberg for later construction. In mid-October, trawlers \"Lark\", \"Polarbjoern\", and \"Selis\" reached the vicinity, but owing to inaccurate charts (dating from the 1865 expedition of Charles Francis Hall) could not find the Roosevelt site. Instead, an eight-man crew commanded by USAAF Captain John T. Crowell was offloaded on a smaller island \"about eight miles southeast of the headland Captain Roosevelt had recommended.\" They operated a weather/radio station over the winter. The expedition reported that \"this island is reported to be some 400 feet high and very level on top providing a natural runway of more than a mile in length.\" The ships left on 5 November.\n\nWhen the station relief and base construction expedition arrived next July, both the Crowell and Roosevelt sites were rejected in favour of a level meadow discovered along the Sylvia Grinnell River on mainland Baffin Island. On 30 July, ships \"Polaris\" and \"Effie M. Morrissey\" anchored in what was then called Koojesse Inlet and began surveying the area: \"The terrain was excellent, with level ground extending nearly the entire 6,000 feet needed for an ample runway...The harbor, readily accessible from the bay, offered a good anchorage for ships of any size that would come in.\" The expedition consisted further of the USCGC \"Bear\", equipped with a seaplane, the transports \"Fairfax\" and \"Eleanor\" and some smaller vessels. Having offloaded the airport construction crews and materials, the expedition left at the end of September.\nBy summer of 1943, the airbase at Koojesse Inlet had \"grown to look like a populous village\" and was in use by many aircraft. It was designated Crystal II and referred to as \"Chaplet\" in coded communications. It was one of three \"Crystal\" weather sites in the Canadian Arctic Region, Fort Chimo (now Kuujjuaq), Quebec being \"Crystal I\", and a station on Padloping Island being \"Crystal III\". A detachment of the 8th Weather Squadron, Air Transport Command (ATC) took up residence at the station on October 1, 1942. The initial mission of the Crystal sites was to provide long-range weather information to the combat forces then building up in the United Kingdom.\n\nAs part of the Crimson East air route network, the airfield at Crystal II was referred to by USAAF Air Transport Command as ATC Station #10. It was intended to be a transport hub between the Eastern Route, which originated at Presque Isle Army Airfield, Maine and the Central Route, which originated at Romulus Army Airfield (Detroit Airport), Michigan. The original plan, briefed by Captain Roosevelt to USAAF Chief Henry \"Hap\" Arnold and others at the Argentia summit in August 1941, called for Frobisher Bay to be a node in a northern alternate air route, running from Churchill, Manitoba via Southampton Island over Frobisher to Bluie West Eight and Bluie East Two in Greenland, rejoining the main route in Iceland. The later success of the main air route via Bluie West One and the spring 1943 victory in the Battle of the Atlantic led to cancelation of the Crimson project in late 1943, and the associated airfields were reduced to weather, communications, and logistics duties.\n\nThe use of Frobisher Bay declined with the end of World War II, with jurisdiction of the facility being transferred to Military Air Transport Service (MATS) in 1948, under its Air Weather Service. During the 1950s it continued to be used as a transit point by the \nUnited States and Canada. The base was closed in 1963 and converted into a civilian airport.\n\nSince the 1950s, Frobisher Bay had earned a reputation as a technical stop for airlines flying the North Atlantic. Crews departing westward from Prestwick or Shannon in those years preferred to route via Iceland (or the Azores) to Gander, thence to New York City or elsewhere. Weather, however, could dictate a northerly course, which is when Frobisher Bay came into its own. At one time, Pan American even had a base there and on at least two occasions had to change engines on Douglas DC-7Cs at Frobisher Bay.\n\nWith the introduction of the intercontinental Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, fewer airlines stopped at Iqaluit. Even so, there always seemed to be some activity. The place remained prominent as a regional airport, continued in its strategic role of sustaining the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW), supported the occasional military exercise or scientific expedition, and was still a key stopover on the North Atlantic ferry route.\n\nThrough the 1960s, Nordair was the main airline serving Frobisher Bay from Montreal, to the south. Douglas DC-4s operated into the 1970s and Lockheed Super Constellations between 1964 and 1969. In 1968 Nordair introduced the Boeing 737-200 on the Frobisher Bay run. At the same time, Bradley Air Services had been expanding. By the 1970s, the company's fleet of de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters and Douglas DC-3s was serving many small Arctic communities from YFB, carrying passengers, mail, groceries, and other essentials. Bradley became known as First Air in 1973 and soon added BAe 748s.\n\nIn the 1980s, Canada's airline industry was in transition, with Air Canada and Canadian Airlines rapidly buying up regional operators. Air Canada acquired Nordair in 1977, and then sold it in 1984 to Canadian Airlines. Jet service to Iqaluit Airport continued, but under the Canadian North banner, which was, after the buyout of Canadian Airlines by Air Canada, to continue operations as an independent airline, jointly owned by the Inuit of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Between 1985 and 1988 First Air added four Boeing 727s to link Montreal and Ottawa with Iqaluit. Meanwhile, Canadian Airlines failed, and was taken over by Air Canada in 2000. In 1995 First Air purchased the small Yellowknife-based carrier Ptarmigan Airways; then, in 1997, Northwest Territorial Airways (NWT Air), Air Canada's Yellowknife subsidiary. In the NWT Air move First Air acquired two 737-200 Combis and a Lockheed 382 Hercules.\n\n\nIqaluit International Airport Fire Department operates one crash tender for local fire suppression and has support from Iqaluit Fire Department when needed.\n\nThe main terminal (c.1986) has:\n\nThe new terminal has:\n\n\nAs a result of increased traffic, the Nunavut government planned an overhaul of the airport that was expected to cost $250–300 million. The project was a public–private partnership with the GN borrowing their half of the cost. Nunavut Airport Services will operate the airport for 30 years. Upgrades included:\n\n\nThe construction began in 2014 and was completed on August 8, 2017, with flight service beginning the following day.\n\nOn September 5, 2015, during construction, a large fire caused major damage to the roof of the new terminal, costing an estimated $1 million.\n\nOver the years several international flights have been diverted to Iqaluit due to technical reasons, air rage or on-board medical emergencies with no deaths being reported. On 31 May 1996, Virgin Atlantic flight 7 from London to Los Angeles made an emergency landing at Iqaluit after a passenger had a heart attack. The landing was executed safely - the first Boeing 747 ever to attempt to land at Iqaluit - but one of the 747's engines hit a fuel pump on the tarmac as it was taxiing, causing serious damage to the aircraft and a potentially dangerous fuel spill. The 397 stranded passengers, including singer Gary Barlow, were flown out after Virgin Atlantic chartered two jets. The passengers, after spending 16 hours in a local curling rink, were taken to New York to catch connecting flights to Los Angeles. Prince Michael of Kent, who had also been on the flight, was given a Royal Canadian Mounted Police escort and departed on an earlier scheduled flight. The original aircraft had its engines repaired and left four days after the accident. The heart-attack victim survived.\nThe Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger jet, conducted cold weather testing from Iqaluit Airport during February 2006 - its first North American visit. They were hoping to experience weather to determine the effects on cabin temperatures and engine performance. Nunavut authorities hope that the importance of these tests will put Iqaluit on the map as a centre for cold-weather testing. In February 2013, Airbus Military used the airport to test the Airbus A400M Atlas military transport aircraft that is currently being developed. The city government sent a delegation to Paris Airshow in June 2013 to promote Iqaluit as an ideal location for these tests. Airbus A350 followed suit and conducted its cold weather testing in January 2014. Airport staff cited low landing fee, sufficient runway length, and minimal air traffic movement all helped in the decision making. Following from these previous successful visits by prototype Airbus aircraft, the company sent the first A320neo with CFM International LEAP engines to be tested in January 2016. As part of the type's first visit to North America, the jet performed several circuits in the subzero temperatures before departing back to Toulouse–Blagnac Airport.\n\nIn December 2005 the Government of Nunavut announced that it would spend $40 million to repair the runway, build a new emergency services facility and a new terminal.\n\nIn January 2012 Air Greenland announced that a 1-hour, 45-minute flight from Nuuk to Iqaluit, down from three days when going via Copenhagen or Reykjavik and then on to Ottawa, would begin 18 June 2012, later changed to 15 June. The service was a partnership with First Air who provided ticketing and other services in Iqaluit. This was the first international flight into Iqaluit since 2001 when First Air discontinued its Iqaluit to Kangerlussuaq flights. Air Greenland used Dash 8 aircraft on the run. After three years in place the service was discontinued for the 2015 season.\n\nAir Canada had operated service to Ottawa and Montreal from March 2010 to August 1, 2011.\n\nAir Baffin began as chartered service in 1989, as a schedule airline in 1992 and renamed as Air Nunavut in 1996.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3676809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3676809", "title": "Scott's Hut", "text": "Scott's Hut\n\nScott's Hut is a building located on the north shore of Cape Evans on Ross Island in Antarctica. It was erected in 1911 by the British Antarctic Expedition of 1910–1913 (also known as the Terra Nova Expedition) led by Robert Falcon Scott. In selecting a base of operations for the 1910–1913 Expedition, Scott rejected the notion of reoccupying the hut he had built by McMurdo Sound during the Discovery Expedition of 1901–1904. \n\nThis first hut was located at Hut Point, 20 km south of Cape Evans. Two factors influenced this decision. One was that the hut was extremely cold for living quarters and the other was that Scott's ship, the \"Discovery\", had been trapped by sea ice at Hut Point, a problem he hoped to avoid by establishing his new base farther north.\n\nSome confusion arises because Discovery Hut can technically be referred to as \"Scott's\" hut, in that his expedition built it, and it was his base ashore during the 1901–1904 expedition, but the title \"Scott's Hut\" popularly belongs to the building erected in 1911 at Cape Evans.\n\nScott's Hut was prefabricated in England before being brought south by ship. It is rectangular, long and wide. Insulation was provided by seaweed sewn into a quilt, placed between double-planked inner and outer walls. The roof was a sandwich of three layers of plank and two layers of rubber ply enclosing more quilted seaweed. Lighting was provided by acetylene gas, and heating came from the kitchen and a supplementary stove using coal as fuel. \n\nApsley Cherry-Garrard wrote that the hut was divided into separate areas for sleeping and working by a bulkhead made of boxes of stores. A stable building (for nineteen Siberian ponies), approximately , was subsequently attached to the north wall of the main building. A utility room, approximately , was also added later, built around the original small porch at the South West end of the main building. \n\nConsiderable effort was made to insulate the building, and to extract the maximum amount of heat from the flues from the stove and the heater, based on lessons learned from the Discovery Hut. Terra Nova expeditioners described the hut as being warm to the point of being uncomfortable.\n\nA cross is erected on a hill behind Scott's Hut at Cape Evans, but this is not connected to Captain Scott, having been erected in memory of the three members of Shackleton's Ross Sea Party, who died nearby. The cross erected in memory of Captain Scott and his polar companions is to be found atop Observation Hill.\n\nDuring the winter of 1911, 25 men of the Terra Nova shore party lived in the hut. From here Scott and his men set out on the ultimately fatal trek to the South Pole. Following the failure of Scott's southern party to return several men remained behind for a further winter (1912) in order to search for the bodies the next spring. In 1913, the Terra Nova expedition over, it was left well supplied with stores in the way of food and oil, and a certain amount of coal.\n\nThe hut was reused from 1915-1917 by several of Shackleton's Ross Sea party after the \"Aurora\", which was to have been the permanent winter quarters, broke adrift in May 1915, and went north with the ice, unable to return. The hut became the permanent living quarters for the ten marooned men, and thanks to the stores they were able to sustain life in comparative comfort, supplementing these stores from Shackleton's Hut at Cape Royds. In January 1917, after Shackleton had rescued the survivors, he had the hut put in order and locked up.\n\nAlthough abandoned from 1917, the hut and its contents are remarkably well preserved today due to the consistently sub-freezing conditions.\n\nAfter 1917, the hut remained untouched until 1956, when US expeditioners dug it out of the snow and ice. It was found to be in a remarkable state of preservation, and included many artifacts from both the earlier expeditions. While some artifacts were taken as souvenirs at the time (and since), this hut has remained largely as it was in 1917.\n\nNew Zealand and the UK have undertaken responsibility at various times since the 1970s to restore (largely by removing snow and ice) both Scott's hut and Discovery Hut.\n\nWhile the preservation of food in the freezing temperatures and dry climate has been noted, bacterial decay still occurs. Visitors describe the seal meat preserved at the Discovery Hut as smelling 'quite rancid', and some have expressed concerns that the fabric of these huts are being affected by fungal decay.\n\nBoth Scott's Hut and Shackleton's Hut have been included on the World Monuments Watch. Shackleton's was included in 2004 and 2006, and Scott's in 2008.\n\nThe hut has been designated an Antarctic Historic Site or Monument (HSM 16), following a proposal by New Zealand and the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.\n\n\n"}

Both projects were parallel but not linked with each other. The \"Unified Political Command\" was meant as a kind of transitional government which should prepare the gradual merger of Iraq with Egypt and North Yemen with Egypt in a new United Arab Republic.\n\nTherefore, on 26 May 1964 Nasser and Arif agreed to form a joint Presidential Council and a Unified Political Command on 16 October 1964. This Unified Command was established on 20 December 1964 and did include the prime ministers of Egypt and Iraq as well as the ministers of economical and financial affairs and social planning of both sides and should act as a joint supreme instrument and highest executive authority to establish the economical, political and military unification of Egypt and Iraq within two years. The Iraqi Abd ar-Razzaq Muhyi ad-Din (Abdel Razzaq Mohieddin) became General Secretary of the Unified Command. In July 1964 an Iraqi Arab Socialist Union was founded as political instrument to collect the support of the population and was formally united with the Egyptian Arab Socialist Union in September 1964. Also in September 1964 Egypt and Iraq agreed to unite their diplomatical corps and representations all over the world. In 1965 Iraq adopted the Egyptian coat of arms eagle and the Egyptian national anthem, declared Iraq as a \"democratic and socialist republic\" and announced a programme of nationalization. However, despite a few real meetings and sessions of this \"Unified Political Command\" the project stopped when the Nasserist prime minister of Iraq, Arif Abd ar-Razzaq, tried to overthrow president Arif in September 1965 and when Arif died in April 1966.\n\nParallelly, but not linked with the Egyptian-Iraqi merger project also between Nasser and as-Sallal a \"Unified Political Command\" was established on 13 July 1964. A joint government council of the Egyptian and Yemeni ministers should coordinate and integrate the Foreign, Defense, Economical, Social, Cultural and Information policy towards full unity. A (short-living) Yemeni \"Arab Socialist Union\" (later renamed) was established already in 1964 and, in fact, Egyptian generals and officers took over the command of the republican forces in Yemen during the North Yemen Civil War. This civil war, however, prevented any progress and when Egypt withdraw its troops from Yemen after the Six-Day War as-Sallal was overthrown in November 1967 and also this project definitively ended.\n\nSimilar \"Unified Political Commands\" and \"Joint Supreme Committees\" were planned and formed \n\n"}

In May 1915, two submarines were sighted off Malta outside the range of coastal artillery, hastening the need to build a battery in the north of the island.\nBetween 30 November and 10 December 1915, the Royal Malta Artillery removed two 6-inch QF guns from the obsolete Wolseley Battery in the south of Malta, and mounted them in a position on the eastern end of the Wardija Ridge.
