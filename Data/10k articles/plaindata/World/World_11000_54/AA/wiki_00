It now houses part of the National Archives of Malta.\n\nThe Banca Giuratale was built between 1726 and 1728 to house the Università, the civil administrative council of Mdina, after their original premises were taken over by Grand Master António Manoel de Vilhena in order to build Palazzo Vilhena. The new building was designed by Charles François de Mondion, a French architect who was responsible for rebuilding many buildings in Mdina.

In 1881, the Education Department converted it into a secondary school, which closed in 1969. The Sisters of St. Dorothy subsequently used the building as a private school, until the lease was terminated in 1978.\n\nSince 1988, the Banca Giuratale has housed the Legal Documentation Section of the National Archives of Malta.

During most of 1938 there would be numerous attacks, counterattacks and skirmishes from both sides along the Segre River. A great number of manpower and material was sent to the Eastern Army of the newly created Eastern Region Army Group in that front. The Spanish republic was able to hold unto that line until the beginning of January 1939 when it became impossible to keep holding the resistance in the Segre against the overwhelming pressure of the rebels.\n\nPhotographer Robert Capa took pictures of the Spanish Republican Navy Marines of the 151 Brigada Mixta who fought in this battle.\n\n"}

These laws and regulations pertain to radio stations and TV stations, and are also considered to include closely related services like cable TV and cable radio, as well as satellite TV and satellite radio. Likewise, it also extends to broadcast networks.\n\nBroadcast law includes technical parameters for these facilities, as well as content issues like copyright, profanity, and localism or regionalism.\n\nIn the US, broadcasting falls under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nSome of the more notable aspects of broadcast law involve:\n\nThe Radio Act of 1927 was the first major broadcasting law in the country. Among its provisions was the equal opportunity provision, providing a foundation for the equal time rule. This provision requires radio and television stations and cable systems which originate their own programming to treat legally qualified political candidates equally when it comes to selling or giving away air time. Concerns that, without mandated equal opportunity for candidates, some broadcasters might try to manipulate elections led to its creation by legislators(1). The Communications Act of 1934 amended the Radio Act and the equal time provision is located Section 315 of the Communications Act.\n\nThe Communications Act of 1934 was another hallmark moment in broadcasting law history, because it created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the purpose of \"regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world wide wire and radio communications service . . . .\" (In this context, the word \"radio\" covers both broadcast radio and television.) The FCC has the authority to \"make such regulations not inconsistent with law as it may deem necessary to prevent interference between stations and to carry out the provisions of [the] Act(2).\"\n\nIn 1949, the FCC enacted a policy, referred to as the \"Fairness Doctrine,\" for the purpose of ensuring balanced and fair coverage of all controversial issues by a broadcast station. The FCC adopted the view that station licensees were \"public trustees,\" and, therefore, had an obligation to broadcast discussion of contrasting viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance. It was later established that stations should also actively seek out issues of importance to their community and air programming about those issues. During the 1980s, the Reagan Administration pressured the FCC to eliminate the fairness doctrine(3).\n\nIn the UK, broadcasting has been regulated by the Office of Communications (Ofcom) since 2002.\nScheduled radio and television broadcasting services need a licence from Ofcom under the Broadcasting Act 1990 or 1996, and must comply with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code made under section 319 of the Communications Act 2003, together with a number of other codes relating to access, electronic programme guides, advertising, and so on. The BBC is subject to some but not all of the requirements of the Broadcasting Code.\n\nOn-demand television services are regulated by the Authority for Video on Demand, so long as they fall within the definition of regulated services in section 368A(1) of the Communications Act, and must comply with the programme standards set out in Part 4A of the Communications Act.\n\nFor more on the regulation of broadcasting in the UK, see Practical Law Company's Broadcasting regulation: a quick guide.\n"}

In addition to MPEG/2 broadcasting, the Champion Teleport is also capable of two-way satellite broadband and is connected by multiple fiber optic lines to several terrestrial backbone providers of Internet connectivity. We have the ability to transmit up to 500 TV stations and thousands of audio and radio channels over satellite on K, C, and K bands (when available) and VSAT connections directly to North and South America, Europe, The Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nLocated in Oxford, Connecticut, the Champion Teleport is one of only about a dozen such facilities in the world. The FCC licensed the teleport in 1996 and the teleport cannot be replicated without spending tens of millions of dollars and considerable time to obtain zoning permits and construction, creating an immediate barrier to entry. The teleport was upgraded in the last two years to become a unique platform for broadband applications combining a satellite earth station, fiber hubs, television, video and audio post and pre-production studios with control centers and conditional access.\n\nChampion Teleport was originally AlphaStar Digital Television, which was one of the original four Direct-To-Home (DTH) satellite television broadcast companies that included DirecTV, EchoStar, PrimeStar, and AlphaStar. Champion now specializes in Internet and intranet broadband content origination, aggregation, multimedia data storage, streaming and digital media services that can then be distributed by a combination of fiber and live 24/7 satellite broadcasts or on demand.\n\nOriginally built as a part of President Reagan's ``Star Wars\" program, the Champion Teleport was designed according to military specifications including—complete redundancy, climate controls, secret rooms, and the ability to withstand a direct attack. It was intended to protect the US by tracking the former Soviet Union's satellites and missiles. As a result the teleport is geographically located to serve as a gateway to the world where it can downlink and uplink satellite feeds from most countries around the globe.\n\n"}

It has 20 member countries from Asia, the Pacific, Africa and the Caribbean with a combined population of 260 million.\n\n\nThe g7+ was first conceived at the 3rd High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra, Ghana, in 2008 where a side meeting convened the representatives of countries in a fragile situation to discuss how development cooperation works in these countries. The group was further formalized at the first Dialogue for Peacebuilding and Statebuilding (IDPS) meeting, held in Dili, Timor-Leste in April 2010.\n\nThe broader IDPS Meeting produced the Dili Declaration recognising the group and adopting a number of its recommendations. The group has since expanded to represent twenty member countries namely Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Papua New Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Solomon Islands, South Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo and Yemen.\n\nThe preeminent decision making body of the group is a Ministerial forum which is convened every year in a member country. Each member state is represented by a Minister. Decisions are made based on consultation among the member countries. The Ministers endorse strategic priorities and an annual plan based on these. The group is chaired by a Minister, selected based on consensus from member countries for a 2-year tenure. The current chair is Sierra Leone's Minister of Finance and Development, Dr Momodu Lamin Kargbo. The g7+ Secretariat functions as an executive body facilitating implementation of the strategic plans and ensuring coordination. The Secretariat is permanently hosted in the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Timor-Leste, based in Dili. Consultations at technical level are held periodically and on an ad hoc basis among the country focal points, who are senior officials from each member countries.\n\nCountries with acute crises, or those which have just emerged from war, conflict or natural disaster, experience difficulties in attaining economic and social development. The World Development Report (World Bank, 2011) found that hardly any of these countries achieved a single Millennium Development Goal. One of the underlying reasons, according to the report, of lagging behind in achieving any development benchmarks in these countries is a lack of peace and strong institutions. The g7+ countries share such challenges and thus sustainable peace and effective state institutions are recognized to be a precursor for economic and social growth. In addition, g7+ countries faced similar of challenges in realizing aid effectiveness principles in their countries, according to the 2008 Paris Declaration monitoring survey, which contributed to further state fragmentation. Thus the g7+ hold the belief that their countries must prioritise peacebuilding and statebuilding to provide foundations that allow them to move towards stability and resilience.\n\nThrough the forum of the International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding bringing together g7+ members and donors, a new set of principles for engaging in fragile situations was negotiated and agreed. These principles were embedded in a framework called the New Deal \"for Engagement in Fragile States\". It was endorsed in November 2011, during the 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, South Korea, by more than 40 countries and international organisations.\n\nThe New Deal calls for country-led peacebuilding and statebuilding goals (PSGs) to be prioritized at country level by government and development partners.\n\nThe PSGs are:\n\nThe New Deal aims to ensure mutual accountability between governments, civil society, donors and other international actors. It seeks to address the root causes of conflict and fragility and to pursue a country-led approach for development partnerships, in line with aid effectiveness principles. It seeks harmonization among donors in their development cooperation to avoid aid fragmentation.\n\nThe g7+ seeks to promote the implementation of the New Deal principles in its member countries, through improved engagement between governments, development partners and civil society, in order to create better partnerships towards peace and resilience.\n\nSince the endorsement of the New Deal, a monitoring survey was conducted in 2014 to assess the progress of its implementation. The IDPS (International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding) also conducted an independent review of the New Deal in April 2016, to assess the relevance of the New Deal principles in the current era. Both of the studies confirmed that New Deal principles are one of the most effective means for leaving no-one behind in the achievement of Sustainable Development.\n\nThe g7+ group also played a crucial role in successfully negotiating the inclusion of a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on peace, justice and strong institutions Goal number 16 in the 2030 Agenda that was adopted at the 70th United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, in New York.\n\nThe g7+ is now seeking to support the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs in its member countries. The g7+ seeks to maintain the momentum of prioritizing peaceful societies, justice and accountable institutions within Agenda 2030. In addition, the group advocates for a special attention to be granted to the countries in a fragile situation in the implementation of Agenda 2030 due to the peculiarity of their challenges.\n\nTo this end, the g7+ will monitor progress across SDGs on the key areas which are common to the membership. The result of this monitoring will then be published to show trends across the g7+ countries while implementing Agenda 2030. The 4th g7+ Ministerial Meeting on 23–24 March 2016 in Kabul, Afghanistan, endorsed g7+ joint tracking of key SDG indicators that will be agreed among the members.\n\nPeer-to-peer learning is one of the priorities that emerged in November 2012 at the g7+ Haiti Ministerial Meeting, and is a key pillar of the Fragile-to-Fragile Cooperation (F2F) concept. F2F aims at mobilising cooperation among member countries, developing a network to share knowledge and expertise among them, and applying the collective skills of the group to the specific challenges each country faces.\n\nIn the spirit of sharing knowledge, in 2013 and 2014 the g7+ carried out a research and mutual learning project on natural resources management, leading to the publication of a manual entitled \"Natural Resources in g7+ countries\". In addition, the g7+ Secretariat published a report called \"Aid Instruments for Peace and Statebuilding: Putting the New Deal into practice\" in 2016, in which different g7+ country case studies highlighted good examples of the application of New Deal principles in the use of aid instruments.\n\nIn the spirit of solidarity and under g7+ Fragile-to-Fragile Cooperation, the g7+ group also help in achieving peace and resilience. This is done by launching missions of eminent persons and other senior officials from member countries into a member country facing challenges. In addition, the group helps in mobilizing international support for the member country in trouble. The group also advances cooperation among member countries, for instance, the Government of Timor-Leste assisted Guinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic in their electoral processes in 2014 and 2015 and assisted Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone in their fight against Ebola.\n\nThe g7+ as a group also aims to advocate at a global level for better policies for international engagement in countries affected by conflict and fragility. In addition to successfully advocating for Sustainable Development Goal number 16 to be included in Agenda 2030, the g7+ also have managed to influence donor processes such as the World Bank IDA17 and IDA18 allocation rounds. g7+ advocacy is based on the principles of New Deal \"for engagement in fragile states\" and focuses on such matters as national ownership, use of country systems, context sensitive flexible policies and predictable aid. Advocacy is practiced through a combination of research publications, public position statements and regular formal and informal dialogue with key international development partners through the IDPS and other fora. The Independent Review of the New Deal in 2016 found that \"The g7+ has become an increasingly influential constituency on the world stage\" (Hearn 2016).\n\n"}

{"id": "3081959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3081959", "title": "International economic cooperation policy of Japan", "text": "International economic cooperation policy of Japan\n\nJapan emerged as one of the largest foreign aid donors in the world during the 1980s.\n\nIn 1991 Japan was the second largest foreign aid donor worldwide, behind the United States. Japan's ratio of foreign aid to GNP in this year was 0.32%, behind the 0.35% average for the OECD's Development Assistance Committee member countries, but ahead of the United States ratio of 0.20%.\n\nThe foreign aid program began in the 1960s out of the reparations payments Japan was obliged to pay to other Asian countries for war damage. The program's budget remained quite low until the late 1970s, when Japan came under increasing pressure from other industrial countries to play a larger role. During the 1980s, Japan's foreign aid budget grew quickly, despite the budget constraints imposed by the effort to reduce the fiscal deficit. From 1984 to 1991, the Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget increased at an average annual rate of 22.5%, reaching US$11.1 billion by 1991. Part of this rise was the result of exchange rate movements (with given yen amounts committed in the budget becoming larger dollar amounts). During the 1980s, foreign aid rose at a lower, but still strong, rate of between 4% and 12% annually in the government budget, with an average annual rate of growth from 1979 to 1988 of 8.6%.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the government took positive measures to increase its Official Development Assistance (ODA) to developing countries and to contribute to the stabilization of the international trade and monetary system. These measures were generally welcomed abroad, although some countries felt that the steps taken were not executed as rapidly or were not as extensive as similar efforts by some other advanced industrialized nations. Japan's ODA increased tenfold during the decade and stood at US$3.3 billion in 1980, but this ODA as a percentage of GNP was still below the average of other donor countries.\n\nIn the 1980s, Japan's ODA continued to rise rapidly. ODA net disbursements, in nominal terms, averaged around US$3 billion per year in the early 1980s and then jumped to US$5.6 billion in 1986 and US$9.1 billion in 1990. Japan's share of total disbursements from major aid donors also grew significantly, from nearly 11.8% in 1979 to about 15% in the mid-1980s, and later to more than 19% in 1989 dropping back to under 17% in 1990. Japan's ODA as a percentage of its GNP, however, did not increase substantially during the 1980s, remaining at about 0.3%.\n\nJapan continued to concentrate its economic assistance in Asia (about 60% of total commitments in 1990), reflecting its historical and economic ties to the region. Japan made modest increases in aid to Africa with the announcement in 1989 of a US$600 million grant program for the next three years. In 1990, Japan also pledged large amounts of assistance to Eastern Europe, but most of that aid was to be in the form of market rate credits and investment insurance, which did not qualify as ODA. In other regions, Japan appeared likely to continue allocating relatively small shares of assistance. Nevertheless, by 1987 Japan had become the largest bilateral donor in twenty-nine countries, nearly double the number in which that had been the case ten years earlier.\n\nThe continued growth of Japan's foreign aid appears to be motivated by two fundamental factors. First, Japanese policy is aimed at assuming international responsibilities commensurate with its position as a global economic power. Second, many believed, the growing Japanese foreign aid program comes largely in response to pressure from the United States and other allies for Japan to take on a greater share of the financial burdens in support of shared security, political, and economic interests.\n\nSuch assistance consisted of grants and loans and of support for multilateral aid organizations. In 1990 Japan allocated US$6.9 billion of its aid budget to bilateral assistance and US$2.3 billion to multilateral agencies. Of the bilateral assistance, US$3.0 billion went for grants and US$3.9 billion for concessional loans.\n\nJapan's foreign aid program has been criticized for better serving the interests of Japanese corporations than those of developing countries. In the past, tied aid (grants or loans tied to the purchase of merchandise from Japan) was high, but untied aid expanded rapidly in the 1980s, reaching 71% of all aid by 1986. This share compared favorably with other Development Assistance Committee countries and with the United States corresponding figure of 54%. Nevertheless, complaints continued that even Japan's untied aid tended to be directed toward purchases from Japan. Aid in the form of grants (the share of aid disbursed as grants rather than as loans) was low relative to other Development Assistance Committee countries and remained so late in the 1980s.\n\nBilateral assistance was concentrated in the developing countries of Asia, although modest moves took place in the 1980s to expand the geographical scope of aid. In 1990 some 59.3% of bilateral development assistance was allocated to Asia, 11.4% to Africa, 10.2% to the Middle East, and 8.1% to Latin America. Asia's share was down somewhat, from 75% in 1975 and 70% in 1980, but still accounted for by far the largest share of bilateral aid. During the 1980s, increased aid went to Pakistan and Egypt, partly in response to pressure from the United States to provide such aid for strategic purposes. Japan had little involvement in Africa, but the severe drought of the 1980s brought an increase in the share of development assistance for that continent.\n\nThe five largest recipients of Japanese ODA in 1990 were in Asia: Indonesia (US$1.1 billion), People's Republic of China (US$832 million), Thailand (US$448.8 million), the Philippines (US$403.8 million), and Bangladesh (US$370.6 million). Earlier in the 1980s, China had been the largest single recipient for several successive years. These large aid amounts made Japan the largest single source of development assistance for most Asian countries. For the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, for example, Japan supplied 55% of net ODA received in 1987, compared with 11% from the United States and only 10% from the multilateral aid agencies.\n\nThe rapid economic growth and rising competitiveness of China readjusted Sino-Japanese relations, and ODA and yen loans to China will gradually phase out until the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n\nThe largest use of Japan's bilateral aid is for economic infrastructure (transportation, communications, river development, and energy development), which accounted for 31.5% of the total in 1990. Smaller shares went to development of the production sector (17.1%) and social infrastructure (19.7%). In general, large construction projects predominate in Japan's bilateral foreign aid. Within the category of social infrastructure, education absorbed 6.7% of the bilateral aid in 1990, water supply and sanitation made up 3.4%, and only 2% went for health. Food aid (0.4% of total bilateral aid in 1990) and debt relief (4.3%) also were included in Japan's official development assistance.\n\n\nMargee M. Ensign, \"Doing Good or Doing Well?

{"id": "19147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19147", "title": "Marshall Islands", "text": "Marshall Islands\n\nThe Marshall Islands, officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands (), are an island country and a United States associated state near the equator in the Pacific Ocean, slightly west of the International Date Line. Geographically, the country is part of the larger island group of Micronesia. The country's population of 53,158 people (at the 2011 Census) is spread out over 29 coral atolls, comprising 1,156 individual islands and islets.\n\nThe islands share maritime boundaries with the Federated States of Micronesia to the west, Wake Island to the north, Kiribati to the southeast, and Nauru to the south. About 27,797 of the islanders (at the 2011 Census) live on Majuro, which contains the capital. Data from the United Nations indicates an estimated population in of . In 2016, 73.3% of the population were defined as being \"urban\". The UN also indicates a population density of 295 per km (765 people per mi) and its projected 2020 population is 53,263.\n\nMicronesian colonists reached the Marshall Islands using canoes circa 2nd millennium BC, with interisland navigation made possible using traditional stick charts. They eventually settled here. Islands in the archipelago were first explored by Europeans in the 1520s, starting with Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese at the service of Spain, Juan Sebastián Elcano and Miguel de Saavedra. Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar reported sighting an atoll in August 1526. Other expeditions by Spanish and English ships followed. The islands derive their name from British explorer John Marshall, who visited in 1788. The islands were historically known by the inhabitants as \"jolet jen Anij\" (Gifts from God).\n\nSpain claimed the islands in 1592, and the European powers recognized its sovereignty over the islands in 1874. They had been part of the Spanish East Indies formally since 1528. Later, Spain sold some of the islands to the German Empire in 1885, and they became part of German New Guinea that year, run by the trading companies doing business in the islands, particularly the Jaluit Company. In World War I the Empire of Japan occupied the Marshall Islands, which in 1920, the League of Nations combined with other former German territories to form the South Pacific Mandate. During World War II, the United States took control of the islands in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign in 1944. Nuclear testing began in 1946 and concluded in 1958.\n\nThe US government formed the Congress of Micronesia in 1965, a plan for increased self-governance of Pacific islands. The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in 1979 provided independence to the Marshall Islands, whose constitution and president (Amata Kabua) were formally recognized by the US. Full sovereignty or Self-government was achieved in a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Marshall Islands has been a United Nations member state since 1991. Politically, the Marshall Islands is a presidential republic in free association with the United States, with the US providing defense, subsidies, and access to U.S.-based agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and the United States Postal Service. With few natural resources, the islands' wealth is based on a service economy, as well as some fishing and agriculture; aid from the United States represents a large percentage of the islands' gross domestic product. The country uses the United States dollar as its currency.\n\nThe majority of the citizens of the Republic of Marshall Islands, formed in 1982, are of Marshallese descent, though there are small numbers of immigrants from the United States, China, Philippines, and other Pacific islands. The two official languages are Marshallese, which is a member of the Malayo-Polynesian languages, and English. Almost the entire population of the islands practices some religion, with three-quarters of the country either following the United Church of Christ – Congregational in the Marshall Islands (UCCCMI) or the Assemblies of God.\n\nEvidence suggests that around 3,000 years ago successive waves of human migrants from Southeast Asia spread across the Western Pacific populating its many small islands. The Marshall Islands were settled by Micronesians in the 2nd millennium BC. Little is known of the islands' early history. Early settlers traveled between the islands by canoe using traditional stick charts.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar landed there in 1526, and the archipelago came to be known as \"Los Pintados\" (\"The Painted (Ones)\", possibly referring to the autochthonous people first found there), \"Las Hermanas\" (\"The Sisters\") and \"Los Jardines\" (\"The Gardens\") within the Spanish Empire, first falling within the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, to then be administered directly by Madrid (through the General Captaincy of Manila in the still-Spanish Philippines) upon the independence of Latin America and the dissolution of New Spain starting in 1821.\n\nThey were only formally possessed by Spain for much of their colonial history, and were generally considered part of the \"Carolines\" (present-day Federated State of Micronesia, Palau, and the US Territories of Marianas and Guam, as well as the Marshall Islands themselves), or alternatively the \"Nuevas Filipinas\" (\"New Philippines\"). The islands were mostly left to their own affairs except for short-lived religious missions (documented in 1668 and 1731) during the 16th and 17th centuries. They were largely ignored by European powers except for cartographic demarcation treaties between the Iberian Empires (Portugal and Castilian Spain) in 1529, 1750 and 1777. The archipelago corresponding to the present-day country was independently named by Krusenstern, after British explorer John Marshall, who visited them together with Thomas Gilbert in 1788, en route from Botany Bay to Canton (two ships of the First Fleet), and started establishing German and British trading posts, not formally contested by Spain.\n\nThe Marshall Islands were formally claimed by Spain in 1874 through its capital in the East Indies, Manila, marking the start of several strategic moves by the Second Reich during the 1870s and 80s to annex them (claiming them to be \"by chance unoccupied\"). This policy would culminate in a tense naval episode in 1885, which did not degenerate into a conflict due to the poor readiness of Spain's naval forces and the unwillingness for open military action from the German side.\n\nFollowing papal mediation and German compensation of $4.5 million, Spain reached an agreement with Germany in 1885: the 1885 Hispano-German Protocol of Rome. This accord established a protectorate and set up trading stations on the islands of Jaluit (Joló) and Ebon to carry out the flourishing copra (dried coconut meat) trade. Marshallese Iroij (high chiefs) continued to rule under indirect colonial German administration, rendered tacitly effective by the wording in the 1885 Protocol, which demarcated an area subject to Spanish sovereignty (0-11ºN, 133-164ºE) omitting the Eastern Carolines, that is, the Marshall and Gilbert archipelagos, where most of the German trading posts were located. The disputes were rendered moot after the selling of the whole Caroline archipelago to Germany 13 years later.\n\nAt the beginning of World War I, Japan assumed control of the Marshall Islands. The Japanese headquarters was established at the German center of administration, Jaluit. On January 31, 1944 American forces landed on Kwajalein atoll and U.S. Marines and Army troops later took control of the islands from the Japanese on February 3, following intense fighting on Kwajalein and Enewetak atolls. In 1947, the United States, as the occupying power, entered into an agreement with the UN Security Council to administer much of Micronesia, including the Marshall Islands, as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1958, it served as the Pacific Proving Grounds for the United States and was the site of 67 nuclear tests on various atolls. The world's first hydrogen bomb, codenamed \"Mike\", was tested at the Enewetak atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1, (local date) in 1952, by the United States.\n\nNuclear testing began in 1946 on Bikini Atoll after residents were evacuated. Over the years, 67 weapon tests were conducted, including the 15-megaton Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb test, which produced significant fallout in the region. The testing concluded in 1958. Over the years, just one of over 60 islands was cleaned by the US government, and the inhabitants are still waiting for the 2 billion dollars in compensation assessed by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal. Many of the islanders and their descendants still live in exile, as the islands remain contaminated with high levels of radiation.\n\nA significant radar installation was constructed on Kwajalein atoll.\n\nOn May 1, 1979, in recognition of the evolving political status of the Marshall Islands, the United States recognized the constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The constitution incorporates both American and British constitutional concepts.\n\nThere have been a number of local and national elections since the Republic of the Marshall Islands was founded. The United Democratic Party, running on a reform platform, won the 1999 parliamentary election, taking control of the presidency and cabinet.\n\nThe islands signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States in 1986. Trusteeship was ended under United Nations Security Council Resolution 683 of December 22, 1990. Until 1999 the islanders received US$180M for continued American use of Kwajalein atoll, US$250M in compensation for nuclear testing, and US$600M in other payments under the compact.\n\nDespite the constitution, the government was largely controlled by Iroij. It was not until 1999, following political corruption allegations, that the aristocratic government was overthrown, with Imata Kabua replaced by the commoner Kessai Note.\n\nThe Marshall Islands sit atop ancient submerged volcanoes rising from the ocean floor, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, north of Nauru and Kiribati, east of the Federated States of Micronesia, and south of the disputed U.S. territory of Wake Island, to which it also lays claim. The atolls and islands form two groups: the Ratak (sunrise) and the Ralik (sunset). The two island chains lie approximately parallel to one another, running northwest to southeast, comprising about of ocean but only about of land mass. Each includes 15 to 18 islands and atolls. The country consists of a total of 29 atolls and five isolated islands situated in about of the Pacific. The largest atoll with a land area of is Kwajalein. It surrounds a lagoon.\n\nTwenty-four of the atolls and islands are inhabited. Atolls are uninhabited due to poor living conditions, lack of rain, or nuclear contamination. The uninhabited atolls are:\n\n\nThe average altitude above sea level for the entire country is .\n\nIn October 2011, the government declared that an area covering nearly of ocean shall be reserved as a shark sanctuary. This is the world's largest shark sanctuary, extending the worldwide ocean area in which sharks are protected from . In protected waters, all shark fishing is banned and all by-catch must be released. However, some have questioned the ability of the Marshall Islands to enforce this zone.\n\nThe Marshall Islands also lays claim to Wake Island. While Wake has been administered by the United States since 1899, the Marshallese government refers to it by the name \"Enen-kio\".\n\nThe climate has a dry season from December to April and a wet season from May to November. Many Pacific typhoons begin as tropical storms in the Marshall Islands region, and grow stronger as they move west toward the Mariana Islands and the Philippines.\n\nDue to its very low elevation, the Marshall Islands are threatened by the potential effects of sea level rise. According to the president of Nauru, the Marshall Islands are the most endangered nation in the world due to flooding from climate change.\n\nPopulation has outstripped the supply of freshwater, usually from rainfall. The northern atolls get of rainfall annually; the southern atolls about twice that. The threat of drought is commonplace throughout the island chains.\n\nCrabs include hermit crabs, and coconut crabs.\n\nMost birds found in the Marshall Islands, with the exception of those few introduced by man, are either sea birds or a migratory species. There are about 70 species of birds, including 31 seabirds. 15 of these species actually nest locally. Sea birds include the black noddy and the white tern. The only land bird is the house sparrow, introduced by man.\n\nThere are about 300 species of fish, 250 of which are reef fish.\n\n\nHistorical population figures are unknown. In 1862, the population was estimated at about 10,000. In 1960, the entire population was about 15,000. In the 2011 Census, the number of island residents was 53,158. Over two-thirds of the population live in the capital, Majuro and Ebeye, the secondary urban center, located in Kwajalein Atoll. This excludes many who have relocated elsewhere, primarily to the United States. The Compact of Free Association allows them to freely relocate to the United States and obtain work there. A large concentration of about 4,300 Marshall Islanders have relocated to Springdale, Arkansas, the largest population concentration of natives outside their island home.\n\nMost of the residents are Marshallese, who are of Micronesian origin and migrated from Asia several thousand years ago. A minority of Marshallese have some recent Asian ancestry, mainly Japanese. About one-half of the nation's population lives on Majuro, the capital, and Ebeye, a densely populated island. The outer islands are sparsely populated due to lack of employment opportunities and economic development. Life on the outer atolls is generally traditional.\n\nThe official languages of the Marshall Islands are English and Marshallese. Both languages are widely spoken.\n\nMajor religious groups in the Republic of the Marshall Islands include the United Church of Christ – Congregational in the Marshall Islands, with 51.5% of the population; the Assemblies of God, 24.2%; the Roman Catholic Church, 8.4%; and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), 8.3%. Also represented are Bukot Nan Jesus (also known as Assembly of God Part Two), 2.2%; Baptist, 1.0%; Seventh-day Adventists, 0.9%; Full Gospel, 0.7%; and the Baha'i Faith, 0.6%. Persons without any religious affiliation account for a very small percentage of the population. There is also a small community of Ahmadiyya Muslims based in Majuro, with the first mosque opening in the capital in September 2012.\n\nSee Health in the Marshall Islands\n\nThe government of the Marshall Islands operates under a mixed parliamentary-presidential system as set forth in its Constitution. Elections are held every four years in universal suffrage (for all citizens above 18), with each of the twenty-four constituencies (see below) electing one or more representatives (senators) to the lower house of RMI's unicameral legislature, the Nitijela. (Majuro, the capital atoll, elects five senators.) The President, who is head of state as well as head of government, is elected by the 33 senators of the Nitijela. Four of the five Marshallese presidents who have been elected since the Constitution was adopted in 1979 have been traditional paramount chiefs.\n\nIn January 2016, senator Hilda Heine was elected by Parliament as the first female president of the Marshall Islands; previous president Casten Nemra lost office after serving two weeks in a vote of no confidence.\n\nLegislative power lies with the Nitijela. The upper house of Parliament, called the Council of Iroij, is an advisory body comprising twelve tribal chiefs. The executive branch consists of the President and the Presidential Cabinet, which consists of ten ministers appointed by the President with the approval of the Nitijela. The twenty-four electoral districts into which the country is divided correspond to the inhabited islands and atolls. There are currently four political parties in the Marshall Islands: Aelon̄ Kein Ad (AKA), United People's Party (UPP), Kien Eo Am (KEA) and United Democratic Party (UDP). Rule is shared by the AKA and the UDP. The following senators are in the legislative body:\n\n\nThe Compact of Free Association with the United States gives the U.S. sole responsibility for international defense of the Marshall Islands. It gives islanders the right to emigrate to the United States and to work there.\n\nThe Marshall Islands was admitted to the United Nations based on the Security Council's recommendation on August 9, 1991, in Resolution 704 and the General Assembly's approval on September 17, 1991, in Resolution 46/3. In international politics within the United Nations, the Marshall Islands has often voted consistently with the United States with respect to General Assembly resolutions.\n\nOn April 28, 2015, the Iranian navy seized the Marshall Island-flagged MV \"Maersk Tigris\" near the Strait of Hormuz. The ship had been chartered by Germany's Rickmers Ship Management, which stated that the ship contained no special cargo and no military weapons. The ship was reported to be under the control of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard according to the Pentagon. Tensions escallated in the region due to the intensifying of Saudi-led coalition attacks in Yemen. The Pentagon reported that the destroyer USS \"Farragut\" and a maritime reconnaissance aircraft were dispatched upon receiving a distress call from the ship \"Tigris\" and it was also reported that all 34 crew members were detained. US defense officials have said that they would review U.S. defense obligations to the Government of the Marshall Islands in the wake of recent events and also condemned the shots fired at the bridge as \"inappropriate\". It was reported in May 2015 that Tehran would release the ship after it paid a penalty.\n\nSince 1991 the Republic of Marshall Islands Sea Patrol, a division of Marshall Islands Police, has operated the 160 ton patrol vessel RMIS \"Lomor\". \"Lomor\" is one of 22 Pacific Forum patrol vessels Australia provided to smaller nations in the Pacific Forum. While some other nations' missions for their vessels include sovereignty, protection, the terms of the Compact of Free Association restrict \"Lomor\" to civilian missions, like fishery protection and search and rescue.\n\nAlthough the ancient skills are now in decline, the Marshallese were once able navigators, using the stars and stick-and-shell charts.\n\n\"Other sports -\"\n\nThe Marshall Islands have a small club league, including Koober as the most successful club. I tournament was held by \"Play Soccer Make Peace\". There is a small Football Association on the island of Majuro. The sport of Football in its growth is new to the Marshall Islands. The Marshall Islands does not have a national football team presently. The Marshall Islands is the only sovereign country in the world that does not have a record of a national football match.\n\nSoftball and Baseball is held under one sports federation in the Marshall Islands. The President is Jeimata Nokko Kabua. Both sports are growing at a fast pace with hundreds of Marshallese people behind the Marshall Islands Baseball / Softball Federation. The Marshall Islands achieved a silver medal in the Micronesian Games in 2012, as well as medals in the SPG Games.\n\nThe islands have few natural resources, and their imports far exceed exports. According to the CIA, the value of exports in 2013 was approximately $53.7 million while estimated imports were $133.7 million. Agricultural products include coconuts, tomatoes, melons, taro, breadfruit, fruits, pigs and chickens. Industry is made of the production of copra and craft items, tuna processing and tourism. The GDP in 2016 was an estimated $180 million, with a real growth rate of 1.7%. The GDP per capita was $3,300.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund reported in mid-2016 that the economy of the Republic had expanded by about 0.5 percent in the Fiscal Year 2015 thanks to an improved fisheries sector. A surplus of 3% of GDP was recorded \"owing to record-high fishing license fees. Growth is expected to rise to about 1.5 percent and inflation to about 0.5 percent in FY2016, as the effects of the drought in earlier 2016 are offset by the resumption of infrastructure projects.\"\n\nIn 2018, the Republic of Marshall Islands passed the Sovereign Currency Act, which made it the first country to issue their own cryptocurrency and certify it as legal tender; the currency is called the \"sovereign\".\n\nThe Marshall Islands plays a vital role in the international shipping industry as a flag of convenience for commercial vessels. The Marshallese registry began operations in 1990, and is managed through a joint venture with International Registries, Inc., a US-based corporation that has offices in major shipping centers worldwide. As of 2017, the Marshallese ship registry was the second largest in the world, after that of Panama.\n\nUnlike some flag countries, there is no requirement that a Marshallese flag vessel be owned by a Marshallese individual or corporation. Following the 2015 seizure of the \"MV Maersk Tigris\", the United States announced that its treaty obligation to defend the Marshall Islands did not extend to foreign-owned Marshallese flag vessels at sea.\n\nAs a result of ship-to-ship transfers by Marshallese flag tanker vessels, the Marshall Islands have statistically been one of the largest importers of crude oil from the United States, despite the fact that the islands have no oil refining capacity.\n\nIn 2007, the Marshall Islands joined the International Labour Organization, which means its labour laws will comply with international benchmarks. This may impact business conditions in the islands.\n\nThe income tax has two brackets, with rates of 8% and 12%. The corporate tax is 3% of revenue.\n\nUnited States government assistance is the mainstay of the economy. Under terms of the Amended Compact of Free Association, the U.S. is committed to provide US$57.7 million per year in assistance to the Marshall Islands (RMI) through 2013, and then US$62.7 million through 2023, at which time a trust fund, made up of U.S. and RMI contributions, will begin perpetual annual payouts.\n\nThe United States Army maintains the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll. Marshallese land owners receive rent for the base.\n\nAgricultural production is concentrated on small farms. The most important commercial crops is Copra followed by coconut, breadfruit, pandanus, banana, taro and arrowroot. The livestock consists primarily of pigs and chickens.\n\nSmall-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and copra.\n\nMajuro is the world's busiest tuna transshipment port in the world, with 704 transshipments totaling 444,393 tons in 2015. Majuro is also a tuna processing center; the Pan Pacific Foods plant exports processed tuna to a number of countries, primarily the United States under the Bumble Bee brand. Fishing license fees, primarily for tuna, provide noteworthy income for the government.\n\nIn 1999, a private company built a tuna loining plant with more than 400 employees, mostly women. But the plant closed in 2005 after a failed attempt to convert it to produce tuna steaks, a process that requires half as many employees. Operating costs exceeded revenue, and the plant's owners tried to partner with the government to prevent closure. But government officials personally interested in an economic stake in the plant refused to help. After the plant closed, it was taken over by the government, which had been the guarantor of a $2 million loan to the business.\n\nOn September 15, 2007, Witon Barry (of the Tobolar Copra processing plant in the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro) said power authorities, private companies, and entrepreneurs had been experimenting with coconut oil as alternative to diesel fuel for vehicles, power generators, and ships. Coconut trees abound in the Pacific's tropical islands. Copra, the meat of the coconut, yields coconut oil (1 liter for every 6 to 10 coconuts). In 2009, a 57 kW solar power plant was installed, the largest in the Pacific at the time, including New Zealand. It is estimated that 330 kW of solar and 450 kW of wind power would be required to make the College of the Marshall Islands energy self-sufficient. Marshalls Energy Company (MEC), a government entity, provides the islands with electricity. In 2008, 420 solar home systems of 200 Wp each were installed on Ailinglaplap Atoll, sufficient for limited electricity use.\n\nThe Ministry of Education is the education agency of the islands. Marshall Islands Public School System operates the state schools in the Marshall Islands.\n\nIn the 1994-1995 school year the country had 103 elementary schools and 13 secondary schools. There were 27 private elementary schools and 1 private high school. Christian groups operated most of the private schools.\n\nHistorically the Marshallese population was taught in English first with Marshallese instruction coming later, but this was reversed in the 1990s to keep the islands' cultural heritage and so children could write in Marshallese. Now English language instruction begins in grade 3. Christine McMurray and Roy Smith wrote in \"Diseases of Globalization: Socioeconomic Transition and Health\" that this could potentially weaken the children's English skills.\n\nThere are two tertiary institutions operating in the Marshall Islands, the College of the Marshall Islands and the University of the South Pacific.\n\nThe Marshall Islands are served by the Marshall Islands International Airport in Majuro, the Bucholz Army Airfield in Kwajalein, and other small airports and airstrips.\n\nAirlines include United Airlines, Our Airline, Air Marshall Islands, and Asia Pacific Airlines.\n\nThe Marshall Islands have several AM and FM radio stations. AM stations are 1098 5 kW V7AB Majuro (Radio Marshalls, national coverage) and 1224 AFN Kwajalein (both public radio) as well as 1557 Micronesia Heatwave. The FM stations are 97.9 V7AD Majuro, V7AA 96.3 FM Uliga and 104.1 V7AA Majuro (Baptist religious). BBC World is broadcast on 98.5 FM Majuro. The most recent station is Power 103.5 which started broadcasting in 2016.\n\nAFRTS stations include 99.9 AFN Kwajalein (country), 101.1 AFN (adult rock) and 102.1 AFN (hot AC).\n\nThere is one broadcast television station, MBC-TV operated by the state. Cable TV is available. On cable TV, most programs are shown two weeks later than in North America but news in real time can be viewed on CNN, CNBC and BBC. American Forces Radio and Television also provides TV service to Kwajalein Atoll.\n\nThe Marshall Islands National Telecommunications Authority (NTA) provides telephone, cable TV (MHTV), FAX, cellular and Internet services. The Authority is a private corporation with significant ownership by the national government.\n\n\n\nGovernment\n\nGeneral information\n\nNews media\n\nOther\n"}

The American navy focused on countering enemy U-boats in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, while convoying men and supplies to France and Italy. Because of United States' late entry into the war, her capital ships never engaged the German fleet, and few decisive submarine actions occurred.\n\nThe main theater of World War I was the Western Front. In order to relieve the British and European allies already on the battle front, the United States Navy was tasked with transporting millions of American soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic to France. The United States Navy was ill-prepared for war, and the only solution was to begin deploying whatever was available on convoy duty and arming merchantmen with small naval guns manned by armed guard detachments.\n\nCongress declared war on April 6, 1917, which meant the United States Coast Guard automatically became a part of the Department of the Navy. Destroyers and similar escort warships were considered the most effective means of sinking enemy submarines and protecting merchantmen. Therefore, destroyer squadrons were based in the British Isles at major ports including Queenston, Ireland. The capital ships took up positions with the British Royal Navy in the North Sea for an uneventful blockade of the German High Seas Fleet that would last even after the armistice into 1919.\n\nThe first victory for the United States Navy took place in the Atlantic on October 15, 1917. The destroyer , commanded by Lieutenant Commander W. N. Vernon, encountered \"U-61\" off Mine Head, Ireland. After chasing the U-boat for an hour, U-61 turned around and fired a single torpedo, which struck \"Cassin\" on port the side. Gunner's Mate First Class Osmond Ingram noticed the torpedo just before it struck and alarmed the K-gun crew, who began firing depth charges. \"Cassin\" was heavily damaged, but her crew kept her afloat and continued firing. Ingram was killed and later was to receive the Medal of Honor, while nine others were wounded. \"Cassin\" struck \"U-61\"s conning tower, which forced her crew to disengage and retreat.\nOn November 17, 1917, two destroyers became the first U.S. Navy ships to sink an enemy submarine. and were escorting convoy OQ-20 eastbound, when a lookout sighted the periscope of \"U-58\". The U-boat was forced to surface by depth charges and was subsequently defeated in a brief surface engagement. At least one shot from \"Nicholson\" struck the u-boat, killing two men and causing heavy damage. The thirty-nine survivors abandoned the sinking \"U-58\" and were taken prisoner. Lieutenants Frank Berrien and Arthur S. Carpender both received the Navy Cross.\n\nFour United States Navy ships were lost during World War I, only two by enemy action, though six merchant ships with armed guards aboard were also destroyed. The first combat loss was , a destroyer, which was sailing to Ireland in a zig-zag pattern with five other warships from Brest. On December 17, \"Kapitänleutnant\" Hans Rose of \"U-53\" sighted the destroyer and attacked with a spread of torpedoes. One was spotted by the Americans, but despite taking evasive action, she was fatally damaged. Commander David W. Bagley ordered his crew to abandon ship, and as she sank the armed depth charges aboard began to detonate, adding to the already heavy casualties. Sixty-six of her crew were killed, and more injured; only thirty-eight survived. \"Jacob Jones\" was the first American destroyer ever lost in battle, and she went down within eight minutes.\n\nThe largest loss of life for the U.S. Navy during the war was on the collier USS \"Cyclops\" in March 1918. She left Barbados on 4 March 1918 bound for Baltimore, Maryland, but was never seen again. She may have been sunk by a German submarine, but it is more likely that she capsized because of the shifting of her cargo of coal. \"Cyclops\" was lost with 236 crewmen and passengers.\n\nThree United States Army and navy transports, USAT \"Henry R. Mallory\", USAT \"Tenadores\" and , received credit for defeating a U-boat on April 4, 1918. Sailing back to the United States from France, a U-boat surfaced at 11:45 and fired her torpedoes at the \"Mallory\". Lookouts spotted the tracks, and the ship was able to evade the torpedo. The submarine was then spotted, and all three ships opened fire with their main guns, hitting the u-boat as it submerged. The Americans began dropping depth charges, but the unknown u-boat was not seen again.\nThe auxiliary yacht engaged on May 21 the \"UC-56\" twice off the coast of Spain while escorting a British merchantman.\nThat afternoon an oil slick was spotted by \"Christabel\"s crew and later was spotted the wake of the submarine. Depth charges were dropped, but the submarine escaped, and returned to harass the convoy that night. At about 11:00pm lookouts on \"Cristabel\" sighted a periscope and immediately maneuvered to fire depth charges. Several successive hits damaged the U-boat, but it escaped and had to cruise on the surface to Santander to prevent its sinking. The crew of \"UC-56\" were interned by Spain, but the U-boat was scuttled rather than be handed over. During the action, a few depth charges became loose aboard \"Christabel\", and at great personal risk Ensign Daniel Augustus Joseph Sullivan secured them, earning him the Medal of Honor.\n\nOn 6 June the British ocean liner was attacked by \"U-151\" about 400 miles east of the Bermudas. Twenty-two crewmen were lost, but the rest survived in the lifeboats. The U-boat remained in the area to use the lifeboats as bait for Allied ships. A few hours, later the auxiliary cruiser USS \"Von Steuben\" arrived and found the lifeboats. But before she reached, them a torpedo was spotted. Two guns opened fire, one on the incoming torpedo and the other on \"U-151\"s periscope. The cruiser also began evasive maneuvers and the torpedo missed her.\n\n\"U-156\", under Richard Feldt, raided the port of Orleans, Massachusetts, on the morning of July 18. Feldt surfaced in the dark and positioned his boat off Nauset Beach. He then began shelling the civilian tugboat and four wooden barges with his deck gun. All five targets were destroyed. A few shells missed and struck shore, becoming the first enemy shells on the continental United States since the 1846 Siege of Fort Texas at the beginning of the Mexican War. Nine Coast Guard Curtiss HS seaplanes spotted the U-boat and dropped bombs on her, but all failed to detonate.\n\nThe following day, USS \"San Diego\" suffered an explosion while sailing from the Portsmouth Naval Yard to New York City. The armored cruiser was northeast of Fire Island when it is thought torpedo struck her port side below the waterline at the engine room below. The damage prevented a water tight hatch from sealing and the engine room and fire room No. 9 both flooded in minutes. Captain Harley H. Christy was convinced he was under a U-boat attack and ordered his men to battle stations. They began firing at anything that even vaguely resembled a periscope. When it was clear the ship could not be saved, Captain Christy gave the order to abandon ship. Twenty-eight minutes after the explosion, \"San Diego\" slipped under the waves, taking six crewmen with her. There was later some controversy over the sinking, as no U-boat was reported in the area. Eventually, the sinking was blamed on a sea mine possibly laid by \"U-156\". USS \"San Diego\" was the only U.S. Navy capital ship lost in the war.\n\nThe only lightvessel of the lost in combat was Diamond Shoal Lightship No. 71. On August 6, she was patrolling off North Carolina's Diamond Shoals when she encounter a sinking cargo ship, , a victim of \"U-140\". The survivors were rescued, and \"LV-71\"s captain, Master Walter Barnett, sent out a warning to friendly that a U-boat was in the area. \"U-140\" intercepted the message and returned. Upon arrival, she surfaced and Commander Waldemar Kophamel demanded the Americans abandon the lightship. As \"LV-71\" was unarmed, her crew had no choice but to row ashore in their boat, while the U-boat destroyed ship with its deck gun. There were no casualties on either side.\n\nUSS \" Mount Vernon\" was a German-owned ocean liner that was seized and armed by the United States Navy. On the morning of September 5, 1918, \"Mount Vernon\" was off the coast of France accompanied by four destroyers, when the periscope of \"U-82\" was sighted. The auxiliary cruiser immediately opened fire with her main guns, damaging the submarine. However, \"U-82\" managed to fire a torpedo. \"Mount Vernon\" tried to dodge the torpedo, but was unsuccessful. Thirty-six sailors were killed and thirteen wounded, but the ship was saved. , , and USS \"Nicholson\" all dropped depth charges, but the U-boat got safely away.\n\nWith the encouragement of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, the United States manufactured 100,000 naval mines for the North Sea Mine Barrage to prevent U-boats from reaching Atlantic shipping lanes. The United States North Sea Mine Force commanded by Rear Admiral Joseph Strauss aboard the Atlantic Fleet Mine Force flagship USS laid the new type of mine in deeper water than had ever before been mined. Rear Admiral Lewis Clinton-Baker, commanding the Royal Navy minelaying force at the time, described the barrage as the \"biggest mine planting stunt in the world's history.\" The official statistics on lost German submarines compiled on 1 March 1919 credited the North Sea mine barrage with the certain destruction of four U-boats, probable destruction of two more, and possible destruction of another two.\n\nAmerican naval operations in the Mediterranean took the form of escorting convoys and delivering supplies. The Mediterranean was not without enemies, Austro-Hungarian forces in northern Italy and the Ottoman Empire were two major threats though by 1917 their navies were mostly defeated or blockaded by ships of the Otranto Barrage. Other than the land Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the Americans engaged in only two memorable battles in the Mediterranean theater.\n\nThe first was when together with sank a U-boat off Algiers on May 8, 1918. \"Lydonia\" and \"Basilisk\" were steaming with a convoy from Bizerte to Gibraltar when they came across the German submarine . A coordinated depth charge attack ensued but the Germans were able to torpedo the British merchant ship , which sank. After a fifteen-minute running battle, the depth charging was stopped and survivors of the \"Ingleside\" were rescued. Heavy seas prevented an immediate assessment of possible damage to the submarine but later evaluations credited USS \"Lydonia\" and HMS \"Basilisk\" with sinking \"UB-70\" when she failed to show up at any port.\n\nTwelve American submarine chasers under Captain Charles P. Nelson were part of attack on the Austro-Hungarian held naval base at Durazzo, Albania. The battle began on October 11 with Italian and British aircraft bombarding Austro-Hungarian concentrations within the city while the allied fleet was still crossing the Adriatic Sea. When they arrived, the larger ships engaged shore batteries while the Americans plotted a path through a sea mine field and engaged two Austro-Hungarian submarines, and . Two destroyers and a torpedo boat were also damaged by American and British ships with help from some Italian MAS boats and one merchant vessel was sunk. In the end no Americans were hurt in the battle and the naval base was left in ruins. For his leadership and courage at Durrazo Captain Nelson received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal as well as other foreign decorations.\n\nCoast Guard Captain Leroy Reinburg of engaged enemy submarines near the Strait of Gibraltar in November 1918. The \"Druid\" was operating as part of the Gibraltar Barrage, a squadron of American and British ships assigned to keeping enemy U-boats from passing from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic. On November 8, 1918, men aboard USS \"Druid\" sighted three surfaced submarines going through the strait. The weather was foul and the seas rough but the barrage squadron attacked anyway, first with gunfire and then with depth charges. reported that she shot a hole through one of the submarines' conning towers with a gun but other than that no other damage was thought to have occurred. USS \"Druid\" and her compatriots were successful in defending the strait and on the following day the Americans helped rescue the British crew of the battleship which had been torpedoed by \"UB-50\" while passing through Gibraltar into the Mediterranean. The war ended three days later on November 11.\n\nAmerican naval forces in the Pacific Theater of World War I were far removed from the conflict with Germany and the other Central Powers. Although Imperial Germany possessed Pacific colonies at the beginning of the war, all of the isolated colonies had easily been conquered by the Allies by 1915. The only significant United States naval presence in the Pacific was a cruiser squadron under Admiral Austin M. Knight.\n\nThere was only one engagement in the theater involving the United States, and it took place just one day after the United States declared war. In December 1914 the German auxiliary cruiser was commerce raiding in the South Pacific, when her commander put in for provisions on the then neutral island of Guam, a United States territory. Captain Adalbert Zuckschwerdt needed coal, but there was little to be had. As a result, the ship was stranded and her crew were interned for the next three years. When the war with Germany finally began on April 6, 1917, the old schooner was ordered to demand the \"Cormoran\" surrender or be sunk. Captain Zuckschwerdt refused to hand over his ship, knowing it would be used against his country. Instead, he ordered his men to scuttle her. In an attempt to prevent this, the captain of the USS \"Supply\" ordered the United States Marines on board to open fire on German crew.
