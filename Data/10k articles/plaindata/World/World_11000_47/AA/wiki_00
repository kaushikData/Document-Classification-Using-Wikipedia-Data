It was established in 2007 with the prime motto of promoting and protecting the rights of workers. Decent work, complete social security of workers and democratic labour market is the primary concern of ANTUF.The General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (GEFONT) (Nepali: नेपाल ट्रेड यूनियन महासंघ) is a confederation of 20 national trade union federations. It is politically tied to the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). GEFONT declares its goal to be \"Socialism for the dignified working class and prosperous life\".\nRegistered in Labour Department, Government of Nepal, ANTUF has been intensifying its campaigns/activities in almost all the sectors from both formal and informal economy over the years. ANTUF has developed a number of trainers in different levels and established strong OSH national, regional/district and enterprises committees. Through regular training/orientation programs, it has not only organized more than 600,000 workers across the nation but also empowered them as well.\nFor past 7 years of its establishment, ANTUF has been constantly taking initiatives for the formation of Labour Law, Trade Union Law and Social Security Bill. Furthermore, ANTUF has been actively lobbying for ratification and implementation of all Labour Laws, Social Security Act and ILO Core Conventions. It has been pressurizing concerned authorities/entities to address the fundamental rights of all workers through the promulgation of new constitution. ANTUF has also been raising issues at national level for the genuine representation of workers including women workers in the decision making body.\nANTUF strives for the democratic labor market and industrial development of nation that includes the end of feudalistic monarchy and the establishment of republic where political, socio-economic and workers rights are guaranteed. With its more than 600,000 levy paying members, ANTUF has now been the leading foundation for the major section of both formal and informal economy workers that always strive for overall socio-economic and political changes in the nation.\nANTUF's Assumptions:\nANTUF believes that state machinery has to be changed to ensure absolute rights of all the working-class people. With its firm conviction, ANTUF takes necessary initiation to bring workers’ friendly state machinery into practice.\n"}

Campbell and \"K7\" were responsible for adding almost to the water speed record, taking it from existing mark of to just over . Donald Campbell was killed in an accident with a much modified \"K7\", on 4 January 1967, whilst making a bid for his eighth water speed record, with his aim to raise the record to over on Coniston Water.\n\nDonald Campbell began his record-breaking career in 1949 following the death of his father, Sir Malcolm Campbell. Initially, he had been using his father's 1939-built Rolls-Royce 'R' type powered propeller-driven hydroplane \"Blue Bird K4\" for his attempts, but he met with little success and suffered a number of frustrating setbacks. In 1951, \"K4\", which had been modified to a prop-rider configuration to increase its performance potential, was destroyed after suffering a structural failure, when its V-drive gearbox sheared its mountings, and punched through the floor of the hull.\n\nFollowing rival record breaker John Cobb's death in his jet boat \"Crusader\", which broke up at over during a record attempt in September 1952, Campbell began development of his own advanced all-metal jet-powered \"Bluebird K7\" hydroplane to challenge the record, by then held by the American prop rider hydroplane \"Slo-Mo-Shun IV\". Designed by Ken and Lew Norris, the \"K7\" was a steel-framed, aluminium-bodied, three-point hydroplane, built at Samlesbury by Samlesbury Engineering, powered by a Metropolitan-Vickers Beryl axial-flow turbojet engine, producing 3500 pound-force (16 kN) of thrust. Like \"Slo-Mo-Shun\", but unlike Cobb's tricycle \"Crusader\", the three planing points were arranged with two forward and one aft, in a \"pickle-fork\" layout, prompting \"Bluebird\"'s early comparison to a blue lobster. \"K7\" was of very advanced design and construction, and its load-bearing steel space frame ultra rigid. It had a design speed of and remained the only successful jet-boat in the world until the late 1960s.\n\nThe designation \"K7\" was derived from its Lloyd's unlimited rating registration. It was carried on a prominent white roundel on its sponsons, underneath an infinity symbol. \"Bluebird K7\" was the seventh boat registered at Lloyds in the 'Unlimited' series.\n\nCampbell set seven world water speed records in \"K7\" between July 1955 and December 1964. The first of these marks was set at Ullswater on 23 July 1955, where he achieved a speed of 202.15 mph (324 km/h) but only after many months of trials and a major redesign of \"Bluebird\"'s forward sponson attachments points. Campbell achieved a steady series of subsequent speed-record increases with the boat during the rest of the decade, beginning with a mark of in 1955 on Lake Mead in Nevada. Subsequently, four new marks were registered on Coniston Water, where Campbell and \"Bluebird\" became an annual fixture in the later half of the fifties, enjoying significant sponsorship from the Mobil oil company and then BP. Campbell made an unsuccessful attempt in 1957 at Canandaigua in New York state in the summer of 1957, which failed due to lack of suitable calm water conditions. \"Bluebird K7\" became a well known attraction, and as well as her annual Coniston appearances, \"K7\" was displayed extensively in the UK, USA, Canada and Europe, and then subsequently in Australia during Campbell's prolonged attempt on the land speed record in 1963–64.\n\nIn order to extract more speed, and endow the boat with greater high speed stability, in both pitch and yaw, \"K7\" was subtly modified in the second half of the 1950s to incorporate more effective streamlining with a blown Perspex cockpit canopy and fluting to the lower part of the main hull. In 1958, a small wedge shaped tail fin, housing an arrester parachute, modified sponson fairings, that gave a significant reduction in forward aerodynamic lift, and a fixed hydrodynamic stabilising fin, attached to the transom to aid directional stability, and exert a marginal down-force on the nose were incorporated into the design to increase the safe operating envelope of the hydroplane. Thus she reached in 1956, where an unprecedented peak speed of was achieved on the first run, in 1957, in 1958 and in 1959.\n\nCampbell then turned his attention to the Land Speed Record, with the aim of establishing a land speed record of plus. He also planned to set a seventh water speed record in the same year, and so become the first person to establish the land speed record and water speed record in the same year. He set out for the Bonneville Salt Flats in August 1960 and was lucky to survive a crash in his Norris Brothers designed \"Bluebird CN7\" turbine powered car later that September. \"Bluebird CN7\" was rebuilt in 1961–62 and Campbell subsequently spent a frustrating two years in the Australian desert, battling adverse track conditions. Finally, after Campbell exceeded the land speed record on Lake Eyre on 17 July 1964, at in \"Bluebird CN7\", he snared his seventh water speed record on 31 December 1964 at Dumbleyung Lake, Western Australia, when he reached , with two runs at and completed with only hours to spare on New Year's Eve 1964.\n\nThis latest success made Campbell and \"K7\" the world's most prolific holders of the water speed record, and in addition Campbell realised his 'double' when he became the first, and so far only, person to break both the land speed record and the water speed record in the same year. Following on from this success, Campbell stated that \"K7\" would be most likely retired and become a museum exhibit. Her hull was ten years old, her engine fourteen, and her design speed of had been exceeded by over on a number of occasions.\n\nIn June 1966, Campbell decided to once more try for a water speed record with K7: his target, 300 mph (480 km/h).\n\nTo add more power, Campbell received a 4,500 pound-force (20 kN) Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine on loan from the Ministry of Defence. This was both lighter and more powerful than the original engine. Campbell also purchased a crash-damaged Folland Gnat, which used the Orpheus engine, as a source of spare parts. The vertical stabiliser from the Gnat was also used on the rebuilt K7, and a new hydraulic water brake designed to slow the boat down on the five-mile Coniston course.\n\nThe boat returned to Coniston for trials in November 1966. These did not go well; the weather was appalling and K7 destroyed her engine when the air intakes collapsed under the demands of the more powerful engine, and debris was drawn into the compressor blades. The engine was replaced, using the engine from the Gnat aircraft that he had purchased at the project's start. The original Orpheus remained outside the team's lakeside workshop for the rest of the project, shrouded in a tarpaulin.\n\nBy the end of November, after further modifications to alter K7's weight distribution, some high-speed runs were made, but these were timed at well below the existing record. Problems with the fuel system meant that the engine could not develop maximum power. By the middle of December, Campbell had made a number of timed attempts, but the highest speed achieved was 264 mph, and therefore still shy of the existing record. Eventually, further modifications to K7's fuel system (involving the fitting of a booster pump) fixed the fuel-starvation problem. It was now the end of December and Campbell was all set to proceed, pending only the arrival of suitable weather conditions.\n\nOn 4 January 1967, Campbell mounted his record attempt. Bluebird had completed an initial north-south run at an average of , and Campbell used the new water brake to slow \"K7\" from a peak speed of when he left the measured kilometre. Instead of refuelling and waiting for the wash of this run to subside, as had been pre-arranged, he then decided to make the return run immediately.\n\nThe second run was even faster; as \"K7\" passed the start of the measured kilometre, she was travelling at over . However her stability had begun to break down as she travelled at a speed she had never achieved before, and the front of the boat started to bounce out of the water on the starboard side. 150 yards from the end of the measured mile, \"K7\" lifted from the surface and after about 1.5 seconds, gradually lifted from the water at an ever-increasing angle, then took off at a 90-degree angle to the water surface. She somersaulted and plunged back into the lake, nose first, then cartwheeled across the water before coming to rest. The impact broke \"K7\" forward of the air intakes (where Campbell was sitting) and the main hull sank shortly afterwards.\n\nCampbell had been killed instantly. Mr Whoppit, his teddy bear mascot, was found among the floating debris and his helmet was recovered. Royal Navy divers were able to locate the wreck of \"K7\", but called off the search for Campbell's body after two weeks.\n\nCampbell's last words, recorded from the radio intercom, were:\n\nThere are varying theories about the cause of the crash. Not waiting to refuel meant the boat was lighter. The wash from the first run would have been made worse by use of the water brake; however, the wash had not had time to reflect back to the centre of the course, and Campbell had used the water brake well to the south. The still photographs taken of the latter part of the final run clearly show that the water brake was not deployed then, and also that when \"K7\" became airborne, the jet engine was no longer functioning; the exhaust would have very noticeably disturbed the water. The engine had therefore flamed out. It is impossible to be certain why; fuel starvation, damage to a structural element during the bouncing, disturbance of the airstream into the intakes during pitching, or a combination of causes are all possible. The most likely ultimate cause is that \"Bluebird\" exceeded its aerodynamic static stability limit, with loss of engine thrust, damage to the port spar fairing, and the then little understood ground-effect lift enhancement all adding to the instability.\n\nThe wreckage of \"Bluebird\" was discovered on the lake bed on 5 January 1967. A 10-man Royal Navy diving team led by Lt Cmdr John Futcher, had arrived at Coniston late on the day of the accident. They set off for their first attempt to locate Donald Campbell and \"Bluebird\" at 12.30pm the next day. Futcher believed that Campbell's body would be either at the point of impact, in the main wreckage of the boat, or at a point between the two locations. Ken Norris had made some calculations to guide the dive team to the boat's likely resting point.\n\nThe first three dives that afternoon found small pieces of wreckage, indicating the dive team were on the correct track. On the fourth dive, the main hull of \"K7\" was found in 142 feet of water, resting in her correct attitude but facing to the south-east. A subsequent and prolonged search located many pieces of wreckage, and various items were brought to the surface including \"Bluebird\"'s broken steering wheel and column.\n\nHowever, the body of Donald Campbell was not located, and the search was called off on 16 January. The Campbell family and team let it be known that they did not wish to have the hull of \"K7\" recovered in the absence of finding Campbell's body. They also felt they would learn nothing from its recovery. The wreck sat on the lake bed for a further 34 years, its location known by a few people but never disclosed.\n\nA diving team led by Bill Smith was responsible for relocating the wreckage and its subsequent recovery was handled by Smith's Bluebird Project team. The wreckage was recovered between October 2000, when the first small sections were raised, and May 2001, when Campbell's body was finally recovered. The largest section, representing approximately two-thirds of the main hull, was salvaged on 8 March 2001.\n\nThe exact date of the retrieval of Campbell's body from the lake was 28 May 2001. He was interred in Coniston cemetery on 12 September that year after a funeral service at St Andrews Church in Coniston.\n\nCampbell's sister Jean Wales had been against the recovery of the boat and her brother's body out of respect for his stated wish that, in the event of something going wrong: \"Skipper and boat stay together.\" This quotation is usually said to have been uttered by Campbell when, in the final week of 1964, he was waiting for good weather to attempt a record run, but a bid seemed so unlikely at that point, his colleagues were pressing him to leave. He refused, and broke the record on the last day of 1964. Jean Wales did not attend his burial or visit his grave although she did remain in daily contact with the salvage crew as the boat's wreckage was being brought ashore.\n\nBecause the boat's water brake was found to be extended when the wreck was recovered, it was generally assumed that Campbell had activated it to slow down before the boat had left the water on his final run. On dismantling the boat, however, a hydraulic accumulator from the donor Gnat aircraft was discovered to be still connected to the system, meaning that stored hydraulic pressure may well have deployed the brake after the accident.\n\nThe boat still contained fuel in the engine fuel lines and a quantity was collected and analysed using gas chromatography as part of the official investigation of the accident commissioned by Barrow Coroner. However, insufficient evidence was present to completely discount the fuel starvation theory. The engine could have cut-out as a result of intermittent fuel starvation caused by the untried fuel system or failure of the electrical supply to the low-pressure fuel-boost pumps. Full details of the boat's strip-down, and the conclusions drawn from it by the investigators, are lodged within the public domain in the diary pages of the Bluebird Project website.\n\nOn Thursday 7 December 2006, Gina Campbell, Donald's daughter, formally gifted \"Bluebird K7\" to the Ruskin Museum in Coniston on behalf of the Campbell Family Heritage Trust. In agreement with the Campbell Family Heritage Trust and the museum, Bill Smith is to organise the restoration of the boat, which is now under way. Now the property of the Ruskin Museum, the intention is to rebuild \"K7\" back to running order circa 4 January 1967. Bill Smith has said that this will take an undisclosed number of years to accomplish. Gina Campbell commented: \"I've decided to secure the future of \"Bluebird\" for the people of Coniston, the Ruskin Museum and the people of the world\". Museum Director Vicky Slowe spoke of Gina's generosity and then said: \"Bill Smith has assured us he can get \"Bluebird\" fully conserved and reconfigured at no cost to the museum. , \"K7\" is being fully restored by The Bluebird Project, to a very high standard of working condition in North Shields, Tyne and Wear, using a significant proportion of her original fabric, but with a replacement BS Orpheus engine of the same type albeit incorporating many original components.\"\n\nAs of May 2009 permission has been given for a one-off set of proving trials of \"Bluebird\" on Coniston Water, where she will be tested to a safe speed for demonstration purposes only. There is no fixed date for completion of \"Bluebird K7\" or the trials. \"K7\" will be housed in her own purpose built wing at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston, while remaining in the care of The Bluebird Project.\n\nOn 20 March 2018 the restoration was featured on the BBC's \"The One Show\", where it was announced that Bluebird K7 would return to the water on Loch Fad, on the Isle of Bute in Scotland, in August 2018 for handling trials.\n\nIn August 2018, initial restoration work on Bluebird was completed. She was transported to Loch Fad where she was refloated on 4 August 2018. Following initial engine trials on 5 August, Bluebird completed a series of test runs on the loch, reaching speeds of about . For safety reasons, there are no plans to attempt to reach any higher speeds.\n\n\n"}

Thus, there was no UN peace-keeping presence in South America, and there was no overarching treaty or Contadora/ Esquipulas Treaty framework in which to ground specific CBMs.\n\nNevertheless, CBMs have been of considerable significance in South America in this period, especially when linked to schemes for economic and political integration. The explicit use of CBMs in this connection may well turn out to have as significant long-term effects as in Central America. Of particular interest is the notion that CBMs and shifts in strategic geopolitical thinking can change the role of the military and assist in strengthening the democratic process. \n\nThe most dramatic shifts have occurred in the Argentine-Brazilian relationship, which has the potential of driving most of the other political, strategic and economic arrangements in southern South America. However, there are other equally significant changes, such as in the Argentine-Chilean and even the Argentine-British relationship which have been positively affected by CBMs in the past decade.\n\nPut in other words, CBMs can assist in shifting the strategic paradigm from one based on hostility and conflict-laden geopolitics to one which stresses \"geo-economics\" and the geopolitics of cooperation and integration with neighbors. \n\nAlthough often ignored outside of the region, South America has a series of historic strains between pairs of bordering states which have always had the potential of flaring up and reaching the conflict stage. Because the military establishments of many of the South American nations have considerably greater potential than the Central American ones, any inter-state armed conflict would be far more damaging than in Central America (the example of the 1982 Anglo-Argentina war over the Falklands/Malvinas is illustrative). \n\nFurthermore, the military establishments of the nations involved have a vested interest in using these possible conflicts as justifications for their budgets, troop levels, and influence. Their use of classical \"war hypotheses\" based on geopolitical thinking and historic animosities with neighbors is an enduring feature which has shaped military roles and missions. Thus, CBMs can have considerable potential if they serve to reduce these animosities, diminish the credibility of the \"war hypotheses\", and make the possibilities of conflict less likely.\n\nA short list of potential bilateral conflict situations would include: Guyana-Venezuela; Venezuela-Colombia; Ecuador-Peru; Peru-Chile; Bolivia-Chile; Chile-Argentina; Argentina-Brazil; Argentina-United Kingdom. Conflicts which are multilateral would include Argentine-Brazilian competition for influence in the South American \"buffer states\" (Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia); attempts to exercise control over extensive economic or patrimonial maritime zones (such as the Chilean effort to claim a \"Mar Presencial\"); and issues of sovereignty and resources in the quadrant of Antarctica which is associated with South America, and which is claimed by Argentina, Chile and Great Britain, despite the presence of scientific bases of some 18 nations, including the U. S.\n\nIt is against this backdrop of potential conflict situations that the significance of CBMs in South America must be examined. Although some of these CBMs have been in place for many years, there was a dramatic increase in their number in the last twenty years, and for the first time the language of CBMs was specifically used in connection with international strains in South America. \n\nAlthough it is difficult to document linkages and causality, it appears that the increased use of CBMs in the Central American conflict scenario, and the involvement of several South American nations in the Contadora and Esquipulas effort, produced a \"contagion effect\" under which CBMs concepts and techniques were transferred from the Central to the South American conflict scenarios. \n\nCBMs have had the greatest impact on the so-called \"ABC\" countries of the Southern Cone (Argentina, Brazil and Chile), and have been linked to attempts at economic integration in the same area (Mercosur); there have also been proposals for a collective security agreement which would unify the Mercosur countries.\n\nWithin the over-all shift from competition to cooperation between these two major forces in South America, there is a strategic component that is remarkable in light of the fact that the contingency planning of these two nations always included the \"war hypothesis\" of armed conflict between them. \n\nOne basic CBM has been the periodic meetings of senior representatives of their General Staffs to discuss matters of common interest and plan for specific measures of military-to-military cooperation such as exchanges of information and joint arms manufacturing. These meetings stemmed from the 1985 Iguazú Declaration, and began as bilateral meetings. \n\nSince then they have included Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile as observers, with plans for including these countries as full members. The meetings are now being called a \"strategic Mercosur\" to parallel the economic Mercosur. Two of the old areas of dangerous competition, nuclear projects and strains over dams along their riverine borders (sometimes called the \"A-Bomb\" of atomic rivalry and the \"H-Bomb\" of incompatible hydroelectric projects) have been basically resolved by means of cooperative approaches in these two potentially conflictive issue-areas between Argentina and Brazil. \n\nThe degree to which CBM terminology has crept into the resolution of these old problems can be seen in the words of Argentine President Carlos Menem when he signed a decree prohibiting the export of Argentine nuclear and ballistic missile technology to nations which refuse to accept international safeguards: \"A lack of transparency (in the past) made us dangerous and untrustworthy\". Followers of CBM trends would immediately recognize the significance and origin of the term \"transparency\" in Menem's words.\n\nThe improvement in relations between these two countries is equally remarkable, given their historic rivalry and the fact that they almost went to war in 1978 over the issue of the Beagle Channel Islands in their far southern frontier. Resolution of that issue by means of Papal mediation paved the way for a series of other measures, many of them clearly CBMs between their military establishments. \n\nAs examples we can cite periodic meetings of the senior naval regional commanders in Puerto Williams, Chile and Ushuaia, Argentina (both sites are on the Beagle Channel). Likewise, southern air force commanders of Chile and Argentine have \"hot lines\", and meet periodically to minimize the danger that border incidents might lead to something more serious. High-level discussions between Presidents Menem and Aylwin over remaining border issues were accompanied by lower-level military contacts and exchange of visits aimed at enhancing CBMs.\n\nCBMs in this area are of special interest because of the legacy of the 1982 war, which might have been averted had confidence-building measures existed then. Some of the CBMs established by the two countries are clearly inspired by CBMs which had been set up between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. \n\nOther CBMs may have stemmed from the Central American peace process, in which Argentina played a significant role as part of the Contadora Support Group as well as participation in the United Nations Observer Group ONUCA (with both observers and a group of naval patrol vessels in the Gulf of Fonseca). The Anglo-Argentine CBMs are contained in a series of joint declarations signed in 1989, 1990 and 1991, and include classic CBMs such as the establishment of direct communication links, exchanges of information, search and rescue procedures, notification of military movements and maneuvers above certain specified levels, and the establishment of certain \"rules of behavior\".\n\n"}

The two governments signed an agreement pushing the proposal ahead, but it never got beyond the planning stage because of opposition from within the Yugoslav and the Greek governments, real world events, and the opposition of the Soviet Union. The proposal envisioned the creation of a confederation of Greece and Yugoslavia.\n\nGreece and Yugoslavia were occupied by Nazi Germany and formed governments-in-exile in London.\n\nEstablishment of the union was the first step of the British \"Eden plan\": its final aim was to create a central-eastern union that was friendly to the west. The next step was to include Albania, Bulgaria and Romania into a Balkan Union. The last step was to be folding of the Balkan Union with a Central European federation formed by Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. The first step was restricted to only Yugoslavia and Greece because they were the only countries that supported the Allies.\n\nThe two governments-in-exile negotiated the conditions of the agreement until the end of 1941. The agreement was signed by Slobodan Jovanović and Emmanouil Tsouderos on the ceremony held in British Foreign Office, presided by the British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden. The agreement explicitly stated that both governments looked forward to accede other countries of the Balkans to the Union. quoted in Although caution was advised with revealing the hope that Bulgaria and Romania would join the union, on 4 February 1942, Eden stated in the House of Commons that the treaty signed between Yugoslavia and Greece was going to be a basis for the establishment of the Balkan confederation.\n\nEncouraged by the British Foreign Office, together with the Polish-Czechoslovak confederation, they were to form a pro-Western organisation of states between Germany and the Soviet Union. Both governments-in-exile agreed to form a political, economic and military union, with the motto \"The Balkans for the Balkan People\".\n\nTheir governments would not be unified but there would be much coordination between their respective parliaments and executives. Their respective monarchies were to be unified with the marriage of King Peter of Yugoslavia to Princess Alexandra of Greece. The union was to be finalised after the war.\n\nThe marriage of Peter and Alexandra proved to be a problematic move and reduced support for the union from both governments-in-exile. On the international scene, the confederation was received favorably by Turkey but opposed by the Soviet Union, as Joseph Stalin saw no need for a strong and independent federation in Europe that could threaten his designs in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 1942, the British government decided to support Josip Tito's forces instead of the Chetniks in Yugoslavia and rejected the plan as unworkable. In 1944, the British withdrew their recognition for the Yugoslav government and recognised the communist Yugoslav National Committee of Liberation of Ivan Subasic, who was subordinate to Tito.\n\nAs the war ended, Yugoslavia shifted towards the communist camp, and the Greek Civil War started.\n\nWith little support for the confederation from any existing powers, it was never realised, but it was briefly entertained in the form of a communist federation by some regional communist leaders, shortly after the war.\n\nBy the end of 1944, the Yugoslav Communist Party began the development of alternative plans for establishment of a Balkan Federation. Because Churchill and Stalin agreed that Greece would be in the Western sphere of influence, the plans had to exclude Greece.\n\n\na As the details of the planned union were never finalized, it is not clear whether it would be a federation or a confederation. Sources use both the term \"Greek-Yugoslav federation\" and the term \"Greek-Yugoslav confederation\".\n\n"}

It consists of soldiers from the armed forces of Moldova, the PMR and Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, originally with a numerical underrepresentation of the PMR. In 1998, the commission was enlarged by the addition of 10 Ukrainian military observers. Moreover, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe also has a Transnistria-based observation mission and participates in all JCC meetings.

The service is operated by Turner Broadcasting System on behalf of the NBA. It was made available prior to the start of the 1995-1996 NBA season. It is available to viewers in the United States and as an international package for all other countries. The pricing structure and services on offer are different, depending on where the viewer is located. The 2013-14 season was the 20th year of League Pass. Full League Pass access for the 2014-15 season was priced at $199 for US customers, for comparison the premium service was £169.99 for UK viewers (these prices are for access to the full season prior to the first game and before any discounts, in previous seasons prices have dropped as the season moves closer towards the play-offs).\n\nNBA League Pass is an out-of-market sports package that allows its subscribers to watch up to 40 out-of-market National Basketball Association games a week. Videos of the games come from local stations and regional sports networks.\n\nLeague Pass comes in three varieties in the United States: NBA League Pass TV, which plays the games through a cable or satellite TV provider; NBA League Pass Broadband, which uses highspeed Internet connection to stream videos to a computer; and NBA League Pass Mobile, which is for mobile devices.\n\nCustomers outside the United States can sign up for NBA International League Pass.\n\nIf a local team is playing and the game is televised in the home market, the associated feed on League Pass is blacked out and unavailable for viewing.\n\nPer the NBA.com website: \n“Games will also be blacked out when they are appearing on national television. This applies to games being televised on ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV. You may view these games simply by switching to the designated channel.” \n\nIn Canada, Bulls games on WGN-TV are not blacked out.\n\nNBA League Pass TV is available with these cable, satellite and streaming providers in the United States:\n\nMost providers who offer subscriptions to League Pass TV also include NBA TV and a companion League Pass Broadband subscription. It is also included in some cable subscriptions.\n\nNBA International League Pass is available to users living outside the United States, and differs from the US version of the product in its content, packaging, and pricing. While both the US and international products feature games available for live or on-demand viewing, the major distinction between the two products is that International League Pass provides access to all NBA games played during the regular season, All Star Weekend, Playoffs, and Finals, free from blackout restrictions. The single exception to this offering is in Canada, where games televised nationally are blacked out live and are available for on-demand viewing only after the game is completed. International League Pass also provides access to games from previous seasons through archives.\n\nInternational users have the option of subscribing to one of two packages: NBA League Pass and NBA League Pass Premium. Subscribers to both packages are able to watch all NBA games from the regular season, All Star Weekend, Playoffs, and Finals live or on-demand from a variety of devices, including desktop computers, iPhones, iPads, Android phones and tablets, and TV-connected devices like Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Xbox and PlayStation consoles (the platforms supported differ by country). Subscribers to both packages are also able to use in-game features including multi-game viewing, stats windows, and a condensed game feature that only includes scoring and highlight plays. Subscribers to the Premium package gain additional features, including access to a live stream of NBA TV International, additional NBA VOD content in the \"Video Vault\" including TNT's Overtime studio show, Spanish language feeds for certain games, and the option to choose between the broadcasts of the home or away team.\n\nBeginning in the 2014-15 season, NBA International League Pass introduced continuous game feeds for selected games and all home feeds, which replaced the game break videos (highlights, commercials, etc.) shown during play breaks with highlight clips, live footage of in-arena activities including dance team performances, half-time entertainment, fans in the crowd, and interviews or features produced by the local broadcaster. Included with this footage is a statistics feed providing stats updates from around the league.\n\nIn addition to the standard and Premium packages, users also have the option to purchase a stand-alone streaming subscription to NBA TV International, which broadcasts games, studio shows, press conferences, and other basketball content. In past seasons, International League Pass has also offered sampling packages that provide stand-alone access to Christmas Day games and All Star Weekend events. The last several weeks of the regular season have also been made available in a separate \"Race to the Playoffs\" package.\n\nDuring the off-season, both International League Pass and International League Pass Premium subscribers have live and on-demand access to Summer League games and certain games or scrimmages played by the USA Basketball team in preparation for or during the Olympics and the FIBA World Cup tournament, in addition to continued access to past NBA regular seasons in archives. This summer content has also been sold as a stand-alone package.\n\nDuring the 2014-15 season, International League Pass offered a free trial of the product during the first week of the regular season and at the halfway point of the regular season, and other promotional free previews have been made available at various points in the season.\n\nNote: Subscriptions can be bought in most regions via the Internet to be streamed to applications on various devices or to a browser (see above for list).

The Mobile View feed will utilize a new dedicated camera angle with a tighter, zoomed-in shot of gameplay. The league will provide a camera and a producer for the feature at each regular-season game, who will have access to the special camera and all others in use for the production.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001, NBA League Pass had a companion service called WNBA Season Pass which showed out-of-market games of the Women's National Basketball Association. The WNBA has discontinued this service; today, all national broadcasts are on ABC, ESPN2, or NBA TV.

{"id": "21602549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21602549", "title": "St.GIGA", "text": "St.GIGA\n\nFollowing a period of financial difficulties and as part of an agreement with Nintendo, from between April 1995 and June 2000, St.GIGA broadcast digitally encoded video games to owners of Super Famicoms with the Satellaview attachment. Satellaview broadcasts were limited in distribution to Japan alone, however through St.GIGA's services Nintendo broadcast a large number of rare \"ura\" and \"gaiden\" versions of some of its most popular franchises such as \"The Legend of Zelda\", \"Mario\", and \"Kirby\". With the exception of \"\", these games have never been re-released and can only be played today via incomplete emulation.\n\nBroadcast between March 11, 1990 and November 28, 2007, St.GIGA has undergone a number of changes of both carrier satellite and broadcast band. The following is a condensed history of these changes:\n\nIn 1990 the established Japanese satellite television company WOWOW decided to expand their services into the field of satellite radio. The core management team made the executive decision to create a subsidiary named St.GIGA. The name was selected by a popular poll of \"persons on the streets\" because the executives agreed that they knew nothing about music. In deciding whom to hire as director for the subsidiary, (who had recently designed the successful J-Wave FM) was selected as an innovator in the field.\n\nSoon after accepting the position, Yokoi crafted a radical proposal for the station concept. The initial reaction at WOWOW was skeptical; however within a few months of traditional satellite radio broadcasts, Yokoi's concept was given probationary adoption, and Yokoi was subsequently given full discretion to shape the company's future.\n\nUnder Hiroshi Yokoi's direction, the St.GIGA station motto became \"I'm here. — I'm glad you're there. — We are St.GIGA.\" This is a reference to Kurt Vonnegut's \"The Sirens of Titan\" in which the alien life forms called harmoniums communicate using only the phrases \"Here I am.\" and \"So glad you are.\" Strongly influenced by the works of Kurt Vonnegut and Kevin W. Kelley's \"The Home Planet\", Yokoi's original concept proposal for St.GIGA would break new ground for broadcast communication methodology.\n\nIn accordance with Yokoi's conception, St.GIGA's broadcasts initially followed no externally fixed (or artificial) timetable. Rather they were based upon the cyclical motif of a 24-hour \"tide table\" where broadcast themes were approximately matched to the current tidal cycle according to the rule of twelfths throughout the 24-hour broadcasting period. Under this innovative schedule, the station broadcast a variety of primarily ambient music programs including , various jazz programs, and (featuring live sound-broadcasts of the ocean shore). The beginnings and ends of programs were not clearly demarcated and instead utilized the unprecedented method where songs of one genre would gradually flow into and intersperse with the songs from the prior genre until the new genre became predominant. The intent, according to Yokoi was to allow the listener to relax in a wave of sound \"like a baby sleeps in the womb.\" \"Tide of Sounds\" broadcasts operated under a principle of \"No Commercials, No DJs, No News Broadcasts, No Talk.\" Unlike most commercial-driven radio broadcasts, this was made possible for St.GIGA due to its reliance on a subscription Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) service. In order to receive this DAB service, the subscriber was required to obtain a special decoder, to pay an initiation fee, and subsequent monthly fees. \"Tide of Sounds\" broadcasts often took the form of high-quality digital recordings of nature sounds accompanied by spoken word narration by an actor as the \"Voice.\" Throughout the life span of \"Tide of Sounds\" broadcasts, the part of the \"Voice\" would be played by a number of notable Japanese poets including Ryo Michiko among others. \"Voice\" performances often consisted of all new poetry composed specifically for the show.\n\nSt.GIGA also broadcast its B-mode audio programming (a series of all classical music broadcasts) over analog broadcasting frequency bands that were shared with its parent, the satellite broadcasting company WOWOW.\n\nHighly artistic and experimental, the St.GIGA sound became extremely popular within certain segments of the population, and the station was recognized for its innovative concept, unique vision, and nonstandard methodology. Fan publications such as \"BSFan Journal\" and \"G-Mania\" sprang up to publish details of the music and to report on the ambient, mood, and electronic scene that was burgeoning in Japan. To this day numerous fan groups, trading groups, and collectors with an emphasis on St.GIGA's musical products exist online.\n\nThe initial popularity of the music funded trips by St.GIGA biomusic recorders to travel abroad to record at such exotic locations as England, Canary Islands, Mikonos, Venice, Bali, Tahiti, Martinique, Hanson Island (BC), and Maui. St.GIGA was also able to release a number of thematic books including the multi-volume \"St.GIGA Stylebook\", (containing the full text of Yokoi's original concept proposal), and (also released on VHS). Later thematic films were sold including \"Traveling with St.GIGA\" (1999) and \"Sound and Vision\" (2007)\n\nSt.GIGA sold a variety of products ranging from program guides to \"sound calendars\" to fragrances. The company also released a number of CDs under St.GIGA's own label as well as a variety of foreign labels such as the Hearts of Space, and music by Deep Forest.\n\nThe market for ambient music and its related forms was not as strong as initially anticipated, and demand was impacted by Japan's recession. By 1994, the station was beginning to face serious financial difficulties, resulting in drastic changes in programming.\n\nBy 1994, St.GIGA's financial difficulties resulted in the cutting back of \"Tide of Sound\" broadcasts. The company's portion of the subscription-funded audio broadcasts were to be replaced under subcontract by an all new series of advertising-funded Satellite Data broadcasts, managed under the \"rescue\" and executive control of Nintendo, St.GIGA's largest shareholder at 19.5%.\n\nBeginning on April 23, 1995, St.GIGA broadcast video-game-related data to owners of the Super Famicom's Satellaview peripheral created by Nintendo. This device bolts onto the underside of the Super Famicom in a manner similar to the later Nintendo 64DD's attachment to the Nintendo 64 and the Game Boy Player's attachment to the GameCube. Only released to the Japanese market, the Satellaview acted as a satellite modem, allowing players to download broadcast data. The resulting games were then stored on requisite specialized rewritable storage cartridges at an additional launch price of 14,000 yen ($143).\n\nThe broadcast content ranged from video-game-related Satellaview news and specific interest journals such as to expansion data for popular Super Famicom games (including, for example, \"Chrono Trigger\") and all new video game releases including titles in such flagship series as \"The Legend of Zelda\", \"Super Mario\", and \"Kirby\". Additionally, a number of these broadcasts featured an updated version of St.GIGA's earlier \"Tide of Sounds\" \"Voice,\" now called , with which St.GIGA voice actors would provide a live vocal track to accompany games, setting plot and describing in-game goals.\n\nDue to the rewritability of the cartridges, the fact that \"SoundLink\" broadcasts were not downloaded to the game cartridges but rather were streamed live during the noon-2AM \"Super Famicom Hour\" broadcasting time, and because the broadcast game data have never been rereleased by Nintendo, these games have become extremely rare. The subculture of collectors and enthusiasts that has grown online have exerted much effort engaged in electronic archaeology by extracting old data from heavily rewritten data cartridges in order to faithfully reproduce the games via emulation.\nAside from St.GIGA's \"SoundLink\" or broadcasts accompanying the transmission of data for its , St.GIGA also broadcast a wealth of information on talk shows and celebrity idols, including a variety show. Broadcast times were fitted to match the schedules of students, and the station's audience demographics shifted radically much to the disappointment of the station's former ambient music fans. Before long the station had ceased transmissions of all \"Time & Tide\" programs (those featuring new age music) including the much-admired , Fan publications such as \"BSFan Journal\" became replaced by more populist publications like , and St.GIGA focused all energies on Satellaview transmissions.\n\nSatellaview transmissions continued uninterruptedly with only a single recertification between 1995 and April 1999. Carrying a \"cumulative debt of 8.8 billion yen\" as of March 1998, a Reuters report on August 21, 1998 indicated St.GIGA's rejection of Nintendo's debt management proposal as well as the broadcaster's failure to apply for renewal of its governmental satellite license. This resulted in the withdrawal of Nintendo's five executive staff, and the withdrawal of all current and proposed programming plans by Nintendo, Kyocera, and \"many content providers\", that had been intended for launch in 2000; though Nintendo's 19.7% ownership portfolio remained intact. St.GIGA continued Satellaview broadcasts after this point; however, the company could only broadcast reruns of games previously transmitted as Nintendo had discontinued its supply of new original content as of March 1999. Facing economic difficulties again, St.GIGA discontinued its Satellaview broadcasts on June 30, 2000 in order to return focus to music broadcasts as had been done prior to the Nintendo deal.\n\nBy 2001, St.GIGA was nearly bankrupt and entered into merger talks with with which it became associated for the remainder of its lifespan. On March 21, 2003, following the death by cancer of director Yokoi, St.GIGA was rechristened under the leadership of . Broadcasts continued until October 1, when the company was forced to sell its licensing rights to World Independent Networks Japan Inc. (WINJ). WireBee immediately began bankruptcy procedures, and all recording instruments and 241 tapes of nature sounds were auctioned off at open market for a total divided sale price of ¥5 million. Discussions concerning Club COSMO's involvement under WINJ's oversight in a new reality show were circulated briefly at this time, however to date no such show has been produced.\n\nIn 2006, WINJ began broadcasting reruns of St.GIGA's original \"Tide of Sound\" and \"Time & Tide\" broadcasts during a 2PM-4PM time slot, however on November 1 of the same year these broadcasts were suspended on the pretext of broadcasting equipment maintenance. The program was scheduled to resume in the 2007 fiscal year, however on November 14, 2007, Hiroya Masuda the Minister of Internal Affairs revoked the broadcasting certificate under Act 54 of Article 24 of the Japanese General Broadcasting Statute.\n\n\n"}
