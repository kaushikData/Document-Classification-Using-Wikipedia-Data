A \"Kapitän zur See\" in the \"Kriegsmarine\", he led the third German Antarctic Expedition in 1938-39, which mapped the New Swabia () area of Queen Maud Land. Ritscher Peak and Ritscher Upland there are named for him.\n\nIn 1897 Alfred Ritscher made his first trip as a cabin boy on the Bremen ship \"Emily\". In 1903 he passed his helmsman exams and earned his master's certificate in 1907. At the beginning of 1912, Ritscher gained a place in the newly created Seehandbuchwerk of the Navy Office.\n\nAlfred Ritscher was skipper of the \"German Arctic Expedition\" of 1912-1913, under the command of Herbert Schröder-Stranz, which departed from Tromsø in the motor vessel \"Herzog Ernst\" for a preliminary reconnaissance of a planned navigation of the Northeast Passage. He also took over the leadership of the airborne survey of the expedition and obtained a pilot licence. The expedition failed whilst attempting the crossing of the Nordaustlandet island in northeastern Spitsbergen archipelago, because of poor equipment, misjudged weather, and starting too late in the year. Ritscher marched over in seven and a half days, to the settlement of Longyearbyen. Search expeditions were sent after his message about the fate of the Schroeder-Stranz expedition and saved six of the fourteen missing expedition members.\n\nDuring the First World War, Ritscher made reconnaissance flights in support of Marine units in Flanders. After the war he worked as an independent businessman and in 1925 worked as a specialist in aerial navigation with Lufthansa.\n\nIn 1934, Ritscher divorced his Jewish wife Susan \"née\" Loewenthal, in order not to endanger his career in the War Department.\n\nAlso in 1934, Ritscher became an officer in command of the Navy. In 1938, he became head of the German Antarctic Expedition 1938/39, with a mandate to set up a base for the German whaling fleet, carry out air exploration and claim territory. During this expedition he flew over an area of about with two Dornier Do J II flying boats, launched from a steam catapult on the expedition ship. Around 11,000 aerial photographs were taken.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Ritscher was preparing another expedition with improved ski-planes, which was cancelled. After the Second World War Ritscher continued as chairman of the \"Association for the promotion of the Archive for Polar Research Inc.,\" which was renamed in 1959 to the West German Society of Polar Research Association.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18855594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18855594", "title": "Asian people", "text": "Asian people\n\nAsian people or Asiatic people are people who descend from a portion of Asia's population.\n\nA variety of definitions and geographical data are presented by organizations and individuals for classifying the ethnic groups in Asia.\n\nIn parts of anglophone Africa, especially East Africa and in parts of the Caribbean, the term \"Asian\" is more commonly associated with people of South Asian origin, particularly Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans. In South Africa the term Asian is used in the pan-continental sense. Due to the high number of Indians in South Africa, in official documentation the designation \"Indian\" is used to refer to both South- and East-Asians. \n\nThe Australian Census includes Central Asia. The Australian Census includes four regions of Asia in its official definition. Defined by the 2006–2011 Australian Census, three \"broad groups\" have the word Asian included in their name: \"Central\" and \"Southern Asian\", \"South-East Asian\" and \"North-East Asian\". Russians are classified as \"Southern and Eastern Europeans\" while Middle Easterners are classified as \"North African and Middle Easterners\".\n\nThe Canadian Census uses the term 'Asian' pan-continentally and the list of visible minorities includes \"\"West Asian\", \"South Asian\", \"Central Asian\" and \"Southeast Asian\"\". The Canadian government uses \"West Asian\" in its statistics; however people from the Arab countries of Western Asia are counted in a separate \"Arab\" category.\n\nNew Zealand's census undertaken by Statistics New Zealand defines the Asian to include people of Chinese, Indian, Korean, Filipino, Japanese, Vietnamese, Sri Lankan, Cambodian and Thai ancestries. In less formal contexts, the term \"Asian\" often does not include South Asian people.\n\nStatistics Norway uses the term 'Asian' pan-continentally and considers people of Asian background to be people from all Asian countries.\n\nStatistics Sweden uses the term 'Asian' to refer to immigrants of Asian background from all Asian countries, including the Middle East.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \"Asian\" is more commonly associated with people of South Asian origin, particularly Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans. The UK usage of the term \"Asian\" is reflected in the \"ethnic group\" section of UK census forms, which treat \"Asian\" and \"Chinese\" as separate (see British Asian). Most respondents to the UK 2001 Census of non-Chinese East Asian and Southeast Asian descent chose to write-in their ethnicity in the \"Other Ethnic Group\" category rather than the \"Other Asian\" category, reflecting the association of the word Asian in the UK with South Asian. Despite there being a strong presence of East Asians in the United Kingdom there are considerably more South Asians, for example the 2001 Census recorded 1.05 million people of Indian origin and 247,000 of Chinese origin in the UK. Peter J. Aspinall of the Centre for Health Services Studies, University of Kent, recommends privileging the term \"South Asian\" over the term \"Asian\", since the term \"Asian\" is a \"contested term\".\n\nIn 1968, an Asian activist conference decided on favoring the name \"Asian American\" over the competing terms: \"yellow\", \"Mongoloid\", \"Asiatic\" and \"Oriental\", since the Filipinos at the meeting thought they were \"brown\" rather than \"yellow\" and the conference thought the term \"Oriental\" was Eurocentric, since they originate from lands \"east\" only from Europe's standpoint and, since the term \"Oriental\" suggested to them \"passivity\".\n\nEarlier Census forms from 1980 and prior listed particular Asian ancestries as separate groups along with \"White\" and \"Black or Negro\". Previously, Asian Americans were classified as \"other\". But the 1980 Census marked the first general analyses of Asians as a group, combining several individual ancestry groups into \"Asian or Pacific Islander.\" By the 1990 Census, \"Asian or Pacific Islander (API)\" was included as an explicit category, although respondents had to select one particular ancestry.\n\nThe 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census Bureau definition of the Asian race is: \"people having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent (for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam)\".\n\nIn 1930 and 1940, \"Indian Americans\" were identified as a separate race, \"Hindu\", and in 1950 and 1960 they were racially classified as \"Other Race\", and then in 1970 they were classified as \"White\". Since 1980, Indians and all other South Asians have been classified as part of the Asian ethnic group. Sociologist Madhulika Khandelwal described how \"...as a result of activism, South Asians came to be included as 'Asians' in the census only in the 80's. Prior to that many South Asians had been checking 'Caucasian' or 'Other'.\"\n\nRespondents can also report their specific ancestry, e.g.: Okinawan, etc. Someone reporting these ancestries but no race would be classified as \"Asian\". Unlike South Asians, Jewish Americans, Israeli Americans, Arab Americans, Armenian Americans, Assyrian Americans, Kurdish Americans, Georgian Americans, Chechen Americans, Turkish Americans, Azerbaijani Americans, Iranian Americans and Central Asian Americans have not lobbied to be included as Asians by the U.S. Census Board.\n\nIn normal American usage Asian does not refer to the people from the Pacific Islands who are usually called Pacific Islanders. The term \"Asians and Pacific Islanders\" or \"Asia/Pacific\" was used on the 1990 US Census.\n\nHowever, in the 2000 US Census, the Asian or Pacific Islander category was separated into two categories, \"Asian\" and \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\".\n\nIn the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, the term \"Asian\" generally refers to people of South Asian and Southeast Asian descent due to the large Indian, Pakistani and Filipino expatriate population in these countries. However, there are instances where the term is used solely to refer to those of South Asian descent.\n\nA 2009 book about forensic anthropology said that the \"\"leading handbook in human osteology\" has kept on using the \"traditional terms\"' of \"caucasoid, mongoloid, negroid\", but \"one of the most popular recent forensic anthropology textbooks\" has changed to the \"more current, politically correct terminology of Asian, white, black, Native American\"\".\n\nEugénia Maria Guedes Pinto Antunes da Cunha of the Department of Anthropology, University of Coimbra, Portugal, said there has been a modern trend in \"most of the forensic anthropology literature\" to \"rename\" the term \"Mongoloid\", a term in which she includes the \"North American Indian\", with the term \"Asian\" or \"Asiatic\". Antunes da Cunha said that, even though the \"terminology\" has changed, the \"underlying assumptions are the same\".\n\nKaren T. Taylor forensic art professor at the FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia, said that the term \"Asian-derived\" is a modern-day euphemism for the \"Mongoloid race\" and it includes \"Native Americans\" and \"various Asian groups\".\n\nIn 2007, Kyung-Ran Jung et al. (Korean:전경란) of the Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan, Seoul, South Korea used the term \"Asian populations\" for the group he also referred to as the \"Asian-Mongoloid\" in which he included Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Thai for a meta-analysis of alleles in relation to rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nDr. Marta Mirazón Lahr of the Department of Biological Anthropology at Cambridge University said \"all\" \"Asian populations\" are \"grouped under the name Mongoloid\".\n\nMasniari Novita of the Biomedical Department of Jember University, Jember, Indonesia, said \"Asiatics\" are part of the \"Mongoloid\" race while \"Asians from the Indian Subcontinent\" are part of the \"Caucasian\" race.\n\nMatt Cartmill of the Department of Biological Anthropology and Anatomy, Duke University, United States, said \"geography has little to do with the race concept in its actual application\", since \"Asian individuals [can be] born in the same geographical region\" as other races.\n\nMichael Bamshad et al. of the Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah, found that \"107 sub-Saharan African, 67 East Asian and 81 Western European\" individuals genetically clustered with \"ancestry from a single population\" at levels of \"almost 100%\", but among \"263 individuals from South India\" the \"proportion of ancestry shared with Europeans and Asians varies widely\".\n\nSandra Soo-Jin Lee (Korean:이수진) of the Department of Cultural and Social Anthropology at Stanford University, United States of America, said that the reasoning behind \"Asian\" being a \"race\" as defined by the US Census is \"difficult to determine\" because it includes \"South Asians\".\n\nWillett Enos Rotzell professor of Botany and Zoology at the Hahnemann Medical College used the term \"Asian\" \"race\" to refer to the race he alternatively called the \"Yellow or Mongolian race\".\n\nA writing style guide published in 2011 by two professors at universities in the United States of America recommends using the term \"Asian\" to refer to people living in Asian countries such as \"China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, etc.\" unless a given situation makes using a more specific nationality term more appropriate than using the broader term \"Asian\".\n\nIn a 2014 article about Asian rhinoplasty, in an academic journal about plastic surgery, Clyde H. Ishii, the article's author, said, \"Although many countries use the term 'Asian' referring to people living on that continent, in reality, Asian usually refers to peoples of East, Southeast, and South Asia. Inhabitants of Southwest Asia, such as Arabs and Iranians, are more commonly designated Middle Easterners. The term Asian as used in this article refers to people from Asia who have a Mongoloid background (Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese, Filipinos, Indonesians, and others).\"\n\n"}

Another series of temporary camps set up at the same time in France was named after United States cities, referred to as \"City Camps\". A single Cigarette Camp, Tophat, was located in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nThe Cigarette Camps were administered by the 89th Infantry Division, headquartered at Bois-Guillaume, near Rouen.\n\nThe names of cigarettes and cities were chosen for two reasons: \n\nFirst, and primarily, for security. Referring to the camps without an indication of their geographical location went a long way to ensuring that the enemy would not know precisely where they were. Anybody eavesdropping or listening to radio traffic would think that cigarettes were being discussed or the camp was stateside, especially regarding the city camps. \n\nSecondly, there was a subtle psychological reason, the premise being that troops heading into battle wouldn't mind staying at a place where cigarettes must be plentiful and troops about to depart for combat would be somehow comforted in places with familiar names of cities back home (Camp Atlanta, Camp Baltimore, Camp New York, and Camp Pittsburgh, among others).\n\nThe camps varied widely in size, from around 2,000 in capacity to nearly 60,000 at the largest of the \"Big Three\", Camps Philip Morris, Old Gold, and Lucky Strike.\n\nThe nine Cigarette Camps included:\n\n\n\nBy war's end, both Cigarette and City camps' roles had shifted from gateways to combat staging GIs for repatriation to the U.S., processing liberated American POWs, and temporarily confining German POWs.\n\nPost-war, many of the camps survived with yet new roles, including housing for displaced persons at least into the mid-1950s.\n"}

Uruguay has the largest percentage with 90.7% being Caucasian or over 3 million people. Argentina equally corresponds to the second largest population and percentage with 39 million people, followed by Colombia with 18m, Venezuela 13.1m, Chile 9.5m, Peru 5.8m, Bolivia 2m, Paraguay 1.3m and Ecuador with 980 thousand. \n\nRoughly 14% of the population in French Guiana is of European ancestry, numbering at 35 thousand people. The vast majority of these are of French heritage, though there are also people of Dutch, British, Spanish and Portuguese ancestry. Countries that make part of South America but do not have Romance languages as their official national languages are Guyana, Suriname and the Falkland Islands. \n\nSuriname has 2% of Caucasians or 12 thousand people, including Lebanese and Jews. Most Boeroes or Dutch Surinamese left after independence in 1975. There are less than 3 thousand Whites in Guyana where 0.5% of the population is counted as \"others\". The Falkland Islands have a low population density. \n\nAccording to the 2012 census, the average daily population of the Falklands was 2,932, excluding military personnel serving in the archipelago and their dependents. \nThe Falklands are a homogeneous society, with the majority of inhabitants descended from Scottish and Welsh immigrants who settled the territory in 1833. Other groups are English, French, Gibraltarian, Scandinavian, Saint Helenian, Chilean and Argentine.\n\nIndigenous people make up about half of the population of Peru and Bolivia. In many places indigenous people still practice a traditional lifestyle based on subsistense agriculture or as hunter-gatherers. There are still some uncontacted tribes residing in the Amazon Rainforest.\n\nArgentina's indigenous population in 2005 was about 600,329 (1.6% of total population); this figure includes 457,363 people who self-identified as belonging to an indigenous ethnic group, and the remaining 142,966 who recognized themselves as first-generation descendants of an Amerindian people. The ten most populous indigenous peoples are the Mapuche (113,680 people), the Kolla (70,505), the Toba (69,452) and the Guaraní (68,454).\n\nIn Bolivia, a 62% majority of residents over the age of 15 self-identify as belonging to an indigenous people, while another 3.7% grew up with an indigenous mother tongue yet do not self-identify as indigenous. Including both of these categories, and children under 15, some 66.4% of Bolivia's population was registered as indigenous in the 2001 Census. The largest indigenous ethnic groups are: Quechua (about 2,500,000 people), Aymara (2,000,000), Chiquitano (181.000), Guaraní (126.000) and Mojeño (69,000).\n\nThe Amerindians make up 0.4% of Brazil's population, or about 700,000 people. Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in indigenous territories in the North and Centre-Western part of the country. On 18 January 2007, FUNAI reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes.\n\nAccording to the 2002 Census, 4.6% of the Chilean population (including the Rapanui of Easter Island) 692,000 persons was self-identified of indigenous origins. Many are descendants of the Mapuche, and live in Santiago, Araucanía and the lake district. Other groups include the Aimara who live mainly in Arica-Parinacota and Tarapacá Region and has the mayority of their alikes living in Bolivia and Peru and the Alacalufe survivors who now reside mainly in Puerto Edén.\n\nColombia's indigenous peoples nonetheless encompass at least 85 distinct cultures and more than 1,378,884 people. A variety of collective rights for indigenous peoples are recognized in the 1991 Constitution. One of these is the Muisca culture, a subset of the larger Chibcha ethnic group, famous for their use of gold, which led to the legend of \"El Dorado\".\n\nAt the present the 25% of Ecuador's population is of indigenous heritage. Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region. Primarily consisting of the descendents of Incans, they are Kichwa speakers and include the Caranqui, the Otavaleños, the Cayambi, the Quitu-Caras, the Panzaleo, the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tugua, the Puruhá, the Cañari, and the Saraguro.\n\nIndigenous population in Peru make up around 34%. Native Peruvian traditions and customs have shaped the way Peruvians live and see themselves today. Cultural citizenship—or what Renato Rosaldo has called, \"the right to be different and to belong, in a democratic, participatory sense\" (1996:243)—is not yet very well developed in Peru. This is perhaps no more apparent than in the country's Amazonian regions where indigenous societies continue to struggle against state-sponsored economic abuses, cultural discrimination, and pervasive violence.\n\n"}

E. Bates. The novel was first published in 1944 and was Bates's first financial success. The title comes from the first line of \"Agincourt\", a poem by Michael Drayton (1563–1631).\n\nThe story concerns John Franklin, the pilot of a Wellington bomber, who badly injures his arm when he crash-lands the aircraft in German-occupied France during the Second World War. He and his crew make their way to an isolated farmhouse and are taken in by the family of a French farmer. Plans are made to smuggle them all back to Britain via Vichy-controlled Marseille but Franklin's conditions worsens and he remains at the farm during the hot summer weeks that follow and falls in love with the farmer's daughter Françoise. Eventually they make the hazardous journey together by rowing boat, bicycle and train.\n\nThe book was adapted into a 4-part television mini-series in 1980 for the BBC, starring David Beames as Franklin and Cécile Paoli as Françoise. This production is available on DVD, distributed by Acorn Media UK. In November 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a two part dramatisation by Maddy Fredericks in the Classic Serial strand.\n\n\n"}

Inspired by the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, international figures from the worlds of business and culture attend the event. The first Forum was held at Farmleigh in Dublin's Phoenix Park from 18–20 September 2009, and was given widespread coverage by RTÉ. The second forum was held at Dublin Castle in 2011.\n\nThe idea for the Forum was conceived by economist David McWilliams who then informed the Irish Government. The hosting of the event caused a political disagreement between Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin and Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Mary Coughlan. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment sought successful members of the Irish diaspora, with Taoiseach Brian Cowen personally inviting them to attend the event in April. However, Martin claimed that the \"global Irish family\" was his department's responsibility. Martin launched the event on the afternoon of 1 September 2009.\n\nGuests pay their own expenses. Attendees have come from Argentina, Australia, Britain, China, Europe, the Middle East and New Zealand. Michael O'Leary was notably absent because of his lack of popularity with the Irish Government. In alphabetical order, notable guests with international connections include:\n\n\nTaoiseach Brian Cowen gave the opening address, talking about the concept of a smart economy. A panel discussion then took place on the topic of \"the global economy: positioning Ireland for the upturn\" and this was followed by further panel discussions on \"Ireland—the innovation island\", \"promoting brand Ireland through our global cultural profile\", \"Ireland’s image abroad: what is it now, how can it be improved and what role can new media play\" and \"Ireland and its Diaspora: harnessing unique resource\".\n\nThose attending also visited Áras an Uachtaráin for a meeting with President of Ireland Mary McAleese and Mary Coughlan presented a meal at Dublin Castle.\n\nGuests will also attend the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final at Croke Park on 20 September. Micheál Martin, whose constituency is Cork South-Central, described it as \"a piece of opportunistic planning by yours truly in anticipation that Cork would reach the final\".\n\nTánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Mary Coughlan was ridiculed in the Irish media after crediting Albert Einstein for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. At the launch on 17 September, she made the comparison \"like Einstein explaining his theory of evolution\". The incident prompted comparisons with American politicians such as Dan Quayle and Sarah Palin, with the \"Evening Herald\" referring to Coughlan in a derogatory manner as a \"lovely girl\" and saying she was \"Ireland's own version\" of Palin. The error came in the same week as she referred to her Green Party coalition partners as \"the vegetables\" during an Irish language radio interview.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Television at the Forum, shareholder Denis O'Brien said Independent News & Media might shut down its flagship London newspaper \"The Independent\" by the end of 2009, saying it was \"irrelevant\" and that nobody wanted to read it. O'Brien also advocated a Yes vote during the second Irish referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon, claiming it was \"essential for setting Ireland on the path to growth\".\n\nCraig Barrett, former CEO and chairman of Intel Corporation, warned delegates that Ireland was spending \"far too little\" on education and that \"schools are a bigger problem than banking\". Taoiseach Brian Cowen seemed to agree with Barrett.\n\nBob Geldof said countries of a similar size to Ireland, some impoverished, were spending as much as 6 per cent on research and development but that Ireland spends just 2 per cent. He also said Mary Coughlan had \"a lovely pair of legs\" which caused her to blush.\n\nOn the second day of the forum, Irish Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Martin Cullen expressed his disagreement with proposed cuts in public sending which were suggested by the McCarthy Report. Neil Jordan said Ireland's culture had not disappointed the country in the same way as institutions such as the banks and the Church had done so. Denis O'Brien said Ireland's culture was the key to success, saying his Digicell group obtained a Samoan licence because the Prime Minister's education had come from Irish priests: \"We are famous for our writers, our artists, our poets and we are not famous for much else\". There was a consensus amongst those attending that Ireland's banks needed to be reformed. Micheál Martin, in his closing remarks to the Forum, said the contributions of the delegates \"will be taken forward and action will be taken\", spoke of his hopes to establish an \"online portal for a virtual community of people of Irish descent to stay in touch\" and stated he would also focus on non-traditional countries of the Irish diaspora such as Russia.\n\nPresident Mary McAleese praised the \"“interest in and commitment to\" of those who attended, saying the event showed that Ireland is \"considerably more than an island on the edge of Europe, but the centre of a vast networked community\".\n\nMartin Murphy, managing director of Hewlitt-Packard Ireland, saw it as an opportunity to \"truly begin positioning this small, export-driven country for real and sustained economic renewal and growth\".\n\n"}

In the face of this threat Pope Paul succeeded in February 1538 in organizing the \"Holy League\" which consisted of the Papal States, the Republic of Venice, the Maltese Knights and Spain with her vassal states of Naples and Sicily.\nTo confront Barbarossa and his roughly 120 galleys and fustas, the League assembled a fleet of about 300 ships (162 galleys and 140 sailing ships) in September 1538 near Corfu. Its supreme commander was the Genoese admiral Andrea Doria, who was then in the service of Emperor Charles V.\n\nThe two fleets met on 28 September 1538 in the Battle of Preveza, and Barbarossa decisively defeated the numerically superior Christian alliance. Doria's leadership in the battle was less than vigorous and is widely believed to have been a major contributing cause to the League's defeat. His hesitation to bring his own ships into full action (he personally owned a number of them) and to sacrifice them for the good of Venice, the traditional rival of his home town of Genoa, are generally considered to explain his actions at Preveza.\n\n\n"}

The Luxembourg crisis was peacefully resolved in 1867 by the Treaty of London but in 1870 the Franco-Prussian War could not be prevented so the league dissolved and refounded as the 'Société française pour l'arbitrage entre nations' (League of arbitration between the Nations) in the same year.\n\nThe Société française pour l'arbitrage entre nations can be seen as a precursor of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, founded with the first Hague Peace Conference in 1899, and a precursor of the League of Nations, founded with the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and followed by the United Nations. The establishment of the Permanent Court of Arbitration was also set up by the Inter-Parliamentary Union that Frédéric Passy founded together with William Randal Cremer in 1889.\n\nThe Inaugural Congress of the League of Peace and Freedom (French: Ligue internationale de la paix et de la liberte) was originally planned for September 5, 1867 in Geneva. Emile Acollas set up the League's Organising Committee, which enlisted the support of John Stuart Mill, Élisée Reclus, and his brother Élie Reclus. \n\nOther notable supporters included contemporary activists, revolutionaries, and intellectuals such as Victor Hugo, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Louis Blanc, Edgar Quinet, Jules Favre, and Alexander Herzen. Ten thousand people from across Europe signed petitions in support of the congress.\n\nThey also counted on the participation of the International Workingmen's Association (IWMA), inviting the sections of the IWMA and its leaders, including Karl Marx, to attend the Congress. They decided to postpone the opening of the Congress until September 9, so as to enable delegates of the Lausanne Congress of the IWMA (to be held on September 2–8) to take part.\n\nWhile the balloting was going on, Citizen Marx called attention to the Peace Congress to be held in Geneva. He said: It was desirable that as many delegates as could make it convenient should attend the Peace Congress in their individual capacity; but that it would be injudicious to take part officially as representatives of the International Association. The International Working Men’s Congress was in itself a peace congress, as the union of the working classes of the different countries must ultimately make international wars impossible. If the promoters of the Geneva Peace Congress really understood the question at issue they ought to have joined the International Association.\n[From \"The Bee-Hive Newspaper\" August 17, 1867, reporting on a meeting of the IWMA Central Council.]\n\nThe anarchist Mikhail Bakunin also played a prominent role in the Geneva Conference, and joined the Central Committee. The founding conference was attended by 6,000 people. As Bakunin rose to speak:\n\nthe cry passed from mouth to mouth: \"Bakunin!\" Garibaldi, who was in the chair, stood up, advanced a few steps and embraced him.

The powerful and illustrious Marcali and Apponyi noble families descended from this kindred. The clan had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to Slavonia and other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nThe clan originated from Sokoró Hills, in the southern region of Győr County, their ancient clan estates laid in present-day Felpéc and Kajárpéc. The earliest known member of the kindred was Lucas I, who lived in the early 13th century. He is apparently the founder of the clan too. Based on the clan's coat-of-arms (narrow silver stripe in blue shield), it is possible that Lucas was a knight from Western Europe, who arrived to Hungary during the early reign of Andrew II of Hungary. For his military service, he was granted lands in Győr County and the surrounding regions. Depending on his origin (German or French), Lucas might have come to the country as an accompanist of either Gertrude of Merania (1205) or Yolanda de Courtenay (1215), the first and second spouse of Andrew II, respectively. His career and life is difficult to outline: it is presumable that he is identical with that Lucas, who served as Master of the cupbearers in the royal court from 1229 to 1230.\n\nLucas' eldest son was George, who owned Ludbreg sometimes before 1248. Ludbreg later became a residence of his son Peter, who erected a castle above the village and adopted his surname after his lands' centre. This branch died out with George's grandson Nicholas Ludbregi in 1357, thereafter Ludbreg and other lands became the property of Ban John Csúz and his descendants. The most powerful member of the kindred was George's another son Denis. Initially, he was a confidant of \"rex iunior\" Stephen, but later joined the partisans of the elderly Béla IV of Hungary. He actively participated in the military campaigns against Austria and Bohemia. He served as Palatine of Hungary and other high-ranking positions several times during the era of feudal anarchy. His son, John was \"ispán\" of Veszprém County as a confidant of Queen Mother Tomasina Morosini in 1295, while his unidentified daughter married Stephen Hahót. Through their only son Nicholas, they were ancestors of the powerful Bánfi (Bánffy) de Alsólendva noble family. George's third son was Serfesd, who owned Nevna (or Névna), present-day Levanjska Varoš in Croatia. His only son Ladislaus Nevnai held estates in Valkó and Požega counties, including Orjava (today Orljavac, Croatia), and was considered one of the richest landowners of the region. He fathered two daughters, Catherine and an unidentified girl. Their marriages to Nicholas Treutel and Andrew Garai, respectively, have prompted the rise of the Treutel kinship and the Palatinal branch of the Garai family. Ladislaus Nevnai handed over his estate of Nevna to his son-in-law Nicholas Treutel in 1324. It is presumable, he died shortly thereafter without male descendants, ending the Nevnai family line after two generations.\n\nGeorge's younger brother was Mark I, who appeared in contemporary documents in the period between 1240 and 1245. Alongside two other local nobles, he unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit for the ownership of some portions of Kajár (present-day Kajárpéc) in 1240; Béla IV ruled in favor of the Bakonybél Abbey, referring to St. Ladislaus' royal charters from the late 11th century. He had five sons; Gregory was one of the military leaders of the Bulgarian campaign in 1266. He was Ban of Barancs and Kucsó in 1272–73, then Judge royal in 1288. It is plausible that he built the castle of Szentgyörgy in order to protect his landholdings against the Kőszegi family. However they besieged and captured the fort from Gregory's only son Joachim around 1315. Through his only son Stephen, Joachim was the forefather of the illustrious Marcali family, which became prominent in the 15th century. The family died out in 1487. Mark I's second son Mark II (fl. 1275) remained insignificant member of the clan. His granddaughters' filial quarter was divided between his brothers' surviving branches in 1349. The third son, Apor was considered an influential baron at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, during the era of Interregnum. He had no descendants. Stephen I was the ancestor of the Berzencei (or Musinai) family and its cadet branches, the Lorántfis and Sándorfis. Lucas III served as \"ispán\" of Zala County from 1289 to 1291 and in 1298. He and his brother Apor besieged and captured Tátika Castle (located near Zalaszántó), which belonged to the property of the Diocese of Veszprém. Thereafter, Lucas and his offspring were sometimes called with the title \"of Tátika\". However the castle was lost to the Kőszegi family by 1314, when Andrew Kőszegi owned the fort. Lucas had five sons; one of them Apor took the Szentgyörgyi surname, and became the first member of that short-lived family.\n\n\n\n"}

The shortwave radio has been broadcasting since December 1, 2008. Current broadcasts last for a total of one hour each day.\n\nWhile Radio Dabanga only broadcast on shortwave radio for the first few years, the station now has several channels. The editors have innovated and experimented in the sphere of new media, often at the request of their listeners. These include Satellite TV, Facebook, WhatsApp, and SoundCloud. Depending on the medium, Radio Dabanga produces news in Sudanese Arabic and/or English.\n\nShortwave radio remains the mainstay of the radio station; one quarter of all Sudanese people are illiterate, a number that is relatively higher in Sudan’s remote areas and camps for displaced people. Many people here have no lifeline to the outside world other than telephone and radio, so it is Radio Dabanga’s mission to provide this.\n\nRadio broadcasting is split into the Morning News and Evening News. The morning news is broadcast from 0430 to 0500 UTC, at a frequency of 7315 and 15550 kHz and evening news is broadcast from 1530 to 1600 UTC, at a frequency of 13800 and 15550 kHz. This means that broadcasts reach Sudan between 07.30 and 08.00 in the morning and between 18:30 and 19:00 in the evening.\n\nBesides the news bulletin, one program is broadcast every day. Editors pick which program is most suitable depending on the news of the day.\n\nCurrent programs:\n\n\nOther programs include \"Lost and Found, Hababkum Darfur\" (\"We Greet Darfur\"), \"Melodies from Darfur, Sudan Files,\" and \"Press Review. Lost and Found\" is a program which aims to reunite loved ones who have lost contact with each other when fleeing conflict, while \"Hababkum Darfur\" allows callers to send greetings across the airwaves to listeners in other places. Occasionally, drama programs are also broadcast over Radio Dabanga. \n\n\"Fi Al Mizan\" (\"On the Scale\") was a justice program co-produced by Radio Dabanga and the Institute for War and Peace Reporting. It focused on local and international justice issues.\n\nInitially, in 2008 Radio Dabanga was broadcast for one hour per day. This increased to three hours per day, but because of the high cost of shortwave Dabanga went back to the original one hour per day; half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon.\n\nBroadcasts are made in Sudanese Arabic. In the past, broadcasts also featured news in Darfuri Arabic, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa.\n\nRadio Dabanga has been broadcasting its TV satellite channel on Eutelsat since the 18 February 2018 on frequency 11354 GHz. The TV Satellite broadcasts the latest radio programs 24 hours per day, showing the latest headlines of Radio Dabanga in text on-screen.\n\nRadio programs which are broadcast via shortwave radio and satellite TV are also uploaded on Radio Dabanga’s website and Facebook page. On 21 August 2018, Radio Dabanga had uploaded a total of 1,848 broadcasts to its SoundCloud channel.\n\nRadio Dabanga also produces news articles in Arabic which are published on the Arabic website, social media and WhatsApp groups.\n\nArabic news is often translated and reworked to suit an international audience on the English language part of the website and social media platforms.\n\nRadio Dabanga reports in exile from Amsterdam. Until 2012 the editorial team operated out of facilities at Radio Netherlands Worldwide, a public radio and television network based in the city of Hilversum. Since then the radio station has operated from the offices of Free Press Unlimited in Amsterdam.\n\nBefore 2013, Radio Dabanga's main focus was conflict areas such as Darfur and the Blue Nile, producing independent news and relevant information for people of Darfur, including internally displaced persons and refugees. Since then the station increasingly shifted to being a reliable source of information for people in all parts of Sudan, covering a wide range of events and issues.\n\nThe editor-in-chief is Kamal Elsadig, overseeing a small group of reporters who work at the central desk in Amsterdam. The radio station receives news from people in the field. These stringers get in contact with the team with information about specific events, which the team then uses to verify and compile news.\n\nAudience participation is a significant source of information as listeners call the radio studios with their own stories and tips. Increasingly, the editors use WhatsApp as a tool to receive, verify and publish news from interested individuals and specialist groups such as medics and civil servants in Sudan.\n\nRadio Dabanga radio broadcasts reach 2.3 individual listeners per day (the population of Sudan is around 40 million) according to a listener survey conducted in 2009; the survey was held among 1,582 respondents over the age of 18 in cities, towns, and Darfur’s refugee camps. The Satellite TV channel is watched by an average of 1 million people per day in Greater Khartoum. Overall, the 2009 survey and spot checks in Khartoum revealed that Radio Dabanga reaches 6.5 million people per week via shortwave radio and satellite TV.\n\nMore information about the online audience of Radio Dabanga is presented in an infographic on their website.\n\nRadio Dabanga is conceived, operated and facilitated by the Dutch NGO Free Press Unlimited in the Netherlands.\n\nRadio Dabanga was founded 2008 by a coalition of Sudanese journalists, a number of international NGOs and the movers behind the Dutch campaign ‘Tot Zover Darfur’, including Stichting Vluchteling, Pax for Peace and Stichting Doen.\n\nWhile Radio Dabanga has a large audience in Sudan, the organization has been criticized by the Sudanese government in the past. The station has survived a number of government efforts to take TV Satellite and shortwave radio broadcasts off-air, including attempts at jamming and prosecution of reporters.\n\nRadio Dabanga’s TV satellite channel was first set up in 2013 with Arabsat. After being taken down by the company in 2015 due to requests by the Sudanese government, Radio Dabanga began broadcasting with Nilesat instead. At the time, Arabsat stated that “Radio Dabanga is considered an enemy of the Sudanese government, it’s not about a few controversial news items but about the whole station.”\n\nRadio Dabanga’s channel was taken down from Nilesat in February 2018 due to a new request from the Sudanese government. Faisal El Bagir of the network of <nowiki>Journalists for Human Rights</nowiki> stated at the time: “This measure illustrates that the regime does not tolerate independent opinions and voices, especially when it comes to the voices of those who would otherwise never be heard.”\n\nRadio Dabanga now broadcasts via Eutelsat, a Paris-based broadcasting company.\n"}

{"id": "50978067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50978067", "title": "The Women's Peace Crusade", "text": "The Women's Peace Crusade\n\nThe Women's Peace Crusade was a grass-roots socialist movement that spread across Great Britain between 1916 and 1918. Its central aim was to spread a 'people's peace', which was defined as a negotiated end to the First World War without any annexations or indemnities. The movement was first established in Glasgow in July 1916, and officially launched on 10 June 1917. It later spread across Great Britain, with demonstrations taking place in Leeds, Bradford, Leicester, Birmingham and Lancashire. Although it gathered a substantial following, the Women's Peace Crusade faced opposition from both the government and police, with members being arrested and reportedly threatened. \n\nThe outbreak of war caused a schism within the pre-war efforts for women's suffrage as individuals within the Suffrage movement took various stances with regards to the necessary morality of Great Britain entering the ever widening war footing that developed among neighbouring European Nations after the assassination of the Arch Duke Ferdinand on 28th June 1914. In the early aftermath of the British Government's Declaration of War, Emmeline Parkhurst, Leader of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), and from her politically motivated decision to move to Paris, announced that, from this time, the WSPU should desist from its suffrage activities and concentrate their efforts in supporting the Government's War effort.\n\nOther women fervently disagreed with this stance. Women around Europe mobilised - against their respective Government's wishes - to convene the annual International Congress of Women in the Hague on 28th of April, 1915. One hundred and ninety women applied for permission to attend by the British Government. Of these one hundred and sixty-six had their passports either refused of cancelled. The remaining twenty-four were considered to be non-militant and allowed to attend. The conference culminated in the creation of various anti-war projects such as 'The International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace' and the 'Women's International League' (WIL). Helen Crawfurd - an Independent Labour Party (ILP) representative and a lapsed member of WSPU - was the secretary of the Glasgow branch of the WIL. Even within the Glasgow branch, class divisions became evident between the middle class and the working-class membership. Helen Crawfurd consequently singled herself, Agnes Dollan, Mary Barbour and, Mrs Ferguson out as the 'local propagandists' of the Glasgow ILP branch, and it was this coalition of women who went on to become founding members of the Women's Peace Crusade.\n\nThe Women's Peace Crusade, sometimes referred to as the Women's Peace Negotiation Crusade, originated in Glasgow at a demonstration on 23 July 1916, which drew a crowd of 5,000 people. The demonstration had been organised by Helen Crawfurd, a working class feminist and socialist who had played a significant role in the Glasgow Rent Strike of 1915. The protest came after a letter was published in the \"Labour Leader\" condemning the women of Britain for not organising any protests against the war. The first meetings took place in Maryhill and Springburn, and subsequent activities included street meetings, marches, selling badges and distributing literature.\n\nThe central demand of the Women's Peace Crusade was to negotiate an immediate end to the First World War, but there were specific aims within this. Literature distributed by the movement stated that it aimed to allow all nations to choose their own form of government, to be fully developed, to access the world's markets and raw materials, and to travel freely. They set themselves against the idea of the right of conquest and forcible annexation, the attempt to retain or increase trade barriers, and any attempt to impose crushing indemnities on any one nation. As well as this, they supported the limitation of armaments and the international organisation of people, aiming to create a common understanding of common interests that they termed 'a people's peace'. \n\nThe Women's Peace Crusade was among the largest peace movements in Glasgow during the First World War, and it was also the one with the most working class, grassroots support.\n\nHelen Crawfurd was one of the founders of the Women's Peace Crusade, and also founded the Glasgow branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, but later said that she was never a pacifist. Instead, she was 'an international socialist with a profound hatred of war with all its ghastly cruelty and waste'. Fractions within the Glasgow branch of the Women's International League led to divisions between the middle class and working class members, and subsequently Helen Crawfurd, along with other working class members, formed the Women's Peace Crusade. These other members included Agnes Dollan, Miss Walker, Mrs Barbour and Mrs Ferguson. While the Women's International League had focused on holding monthly meetings with speakers and discussions, the Women's Peace Crusade now took the anti-war message onto the streets and into working class communities.\n\nThe Women's Peace Crusade met with a great deal of opposition from both the government and the media. The right-wing \"Morning Post\" described the movement as ‘one of the most active and pernicious propaganda organisations in the country'. On 11 August 1917, a march of 1,200 women in Lancashire was met with a great deal of hostility. Upon arriving at Nelson's recreation ground, a crowd of 50,000 counter-demonstrators began shouting 'Traitors! Murderers!' at the group, and only a police presence stopped them from being physically harmed.\n"}
