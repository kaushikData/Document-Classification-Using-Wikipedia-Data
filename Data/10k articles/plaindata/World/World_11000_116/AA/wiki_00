{"id": "571843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=571843", "title": "Absolute Radio", "text": "Absolute Radio\n\nAbsolute Radio (originally Virgin Radio) is one of the UK's three Independent National Radio stations. The station rebranded to its current name at 7:45 am on 29 September 2008.\n\nThe station is based in London and plays popular rock music. It currently broadcasts on medium wave and DAB across the UK, on 105.8 FM in London and 105.2 FM in the West Midlands, Sky (channel 0107), Virgin Media (channel 915), Freeview (channel 727) and Freesat (channel 724). It is also available in other parts of the world via satellite, cable, and on the Internet. As of 31 December 2013, international streaming via the internet has been discontinued. Absolute Radio is a patron of The Radio Academy.\n\nAbsolute Radio is owned and operated by Bauer Radio of Hamburg based Bauer Media Group, it forms part of Bauer's National portfolio of radio brands.\n\nThe 1990 Broadcasting Act allowed for the launch of independent national radio (INR) stations in the United Kingdom. The Radio Authority was mandated to award three INR licences, one of which (INR1) had to be for a 'non-pop' station (which was awarded to Classic FM), and one of which had to be for a predominantly speech-based service (this would be advertised later as INR3 and would be awarded to Talk Radio). The remaining licence was to be open to 'all-comers'. The licences were to be awarded to the highest cash bidder, providing that the applicant met criteria set down in the Broadcasting Act.\n\nThe second national licence, INR2, would take over the 1197 kHz and 1215 kHz frequencies, which were to be relinquished by BBC Radio 3. The licence was advertised in October 1991 and five organisations bid: the Independent National Broadcasting Company of Sheffield, which bid £4,010,000 per year; a TV-am/Virgin consortium (£1,883,000); Chiltern Radio's 20/20 Radio (£1,311,000); Radio Clyde's Score Radio (£701,000); and a consortium of CLT, Harvey Goldsmith and RTÉ (£211,000). The TV-am/Virgin consortium was awarded the licence in April 1992, after the Radio Authority said that it was not satisfied that Independent National Broadcasting would be able to sustain the service. Later that year, TV-am lost its ITV franchise and its stake in the radio station was sold in March 1993 to Apax Partners, JP Morgan Investment Corporation and Sir David Frost.\n\nThe station launched as Virgin 1215 at 12.15 pm on 30 April 1993. The original line-up of DJs included Richard Skinner, Russ Williams, Jono Coleman, Mitch Johnson, Graham Dene, Nick Abbot, Wendy Lloyd, Tommy Vance, Emperor Rosko and Dave Fanning. Chris Evans was also hired to present a Saturday morning show, following his success at BBC GLR in the weekend mid-morning slot. The Show, The Big Red Mug Show was sponsored by Nescafe. The first song was a cover version of the Steppenwolf song \"Born to be Wild\", recorded by Australian group INXS. Richard Branson was the first voice to be heard, live from the Virgin Megastore in Manchester, with Richard Skinner the first voice back in the London studios. Skinner was also programme director, a role he shared with John Revell. John Pearson was launch sales director, a role he had previously held at LBC . Andy Mollett was launch finance director. David Campbell, previously managing director of one of Virgin's post-production television companies, was the chief executive at launch.\n\nFrom before its launch on AM, Virgin Radio was campaigning for a national FM network. Initially, it lobbied for Radio 4's FM network to be made available and then, when the Radio Authority launched a consultation on the use of the 105–108 MHz band, it lobbied for it to be set aside as a national network. The Radio Authority decided, however, that 105–108 MHz would be licensed to new local and regional stations and Virgin Radio applied for and won one of the new FM licences advertised in London as a result.\n\nVirgin Radio launched on 105.8 MHz FM in London on 10 April 1995 beginning with a message from broadcaster David Frost at 6 am followed by the Russ 'n’ Jono breakfast show. Part of the licence requirements for the London service meant that a daily London opt-out was broadcast on FM, presented initially by Rowland Rivron.\n\nWithin a year, Virgin Group was considering the next steps for the radio station, including the option of a flotation or buying back the shares of JP Morgan, Apax and Sir David Frost. In May 1997, it was announced that Capital Radio had agreed to acquire Virgin Radio in an £87 million deal. Capital's plans included moving Virgin Radio from 1 Golden Square to Capital's Leicester Square building and splitting programming between the AM and FM services. The Radio Authority approved the acquisition, but Nigel Griffiths, the Consumer Affairs Minister, referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC). The MMC report into the takeover would not be issued until January 1998, and would recommend that the deal could only go ahead if Capital Gold was sold or Virgin's London FM licence was left out of the deal. However, the delay in approval of the Capital acquisition would ultimately lead to the deal not going through.\n\nIn January 1997, Chris Evans had left his role as presenter of the Radio 1 breakfast show as a result of a disagreement between him and the programme controller Matthew Bannister (Evans had asked for Fridays off to allow more time for him to work on his Channel 4 television show, TFI Friday). Evans was keen to return to radio and it had been reported that his agent, Michael Foster, had approached Matthew Bannister to ask if Evans would be allowed to be return to Radio 1, and he had gone as far as commencing negotiations to buy Talk Radio.\n\nRichard Branson wanted Evans to work for Virgin Radio, so much so that he joined him on a Concorde flight to New York to try to persuade him to join as the drive time presenter. In the end, Virgin Radio hired Evans to present the breakfast show, replacing the incumbent Russ 'n' Jono show (presented by Russ Williams and Jonathan Coleman). His show started on 13 October 1997, the same day that Zoë Ball started as Evans' replacement on Radio 1. The initial contract would only be for 10 weeks, until the MMC announced its decision on the Capital Radio takeover. Evans approached David Campbell to discuss buying the radio station and, with Michael Foster's help, they put together a deal to buy it with venture capital supplied by Apax Partners and Paribas, with Virgin Group retaining a 20% stake in the business. The deal was announced on 8 December 1997, and would see the formation of the Ginger Media Group, an umbrella company overseeing Virgin Radio and producing programmes such as TFI Friday.\n\nEvans' ownership of Virgin Radio started well, with a breakfast show audience increase of 660,000 to 2.2m in his first three months. In August 1998, Chris Evans took a spur of the moment decision one weekend to launch a Saturday afternoon show called Rock 'n' Roll Football, a show that is still broadcast on Absolute Radio. From 5 October 1998, Virgin Radio started simulcasts of the breakfast show on Sky One each morning for an hour between 7.30 and 8.30 am. When a track was played on the radio, viewers would see a video at the same time.\n\nThe start of the new football season in August 1999 saw Terry Venables join Russ Williams in a show that would precede Rock 'n' Roll Football. At the end of 1999, in response to the TV programme Who Wants To Be A Millionaire not having given away its top prize, Virgin Radio set a broadcasting first when Clare Barwick won £1 million at the culmination of \"Someone's Going To Be A Millionaire\".\n\nThe management team at the Ginger Media Group were considering expansion opportunities, including a plan to acquire the Daily Star newspaper from United News & Media, and hire Piers Morgan to edit it. Their plans were stalled, however, when the shareholders got cold feet. Evans wrote in his autobiography that \"the management wanted to stick to our original brief of expansion, whereas our investors only cared about extracting the added value.\"\n\nThe management team therefore set itself on a strategy to sell the business three years ahead of schedule. It hired Goldman Sachs to run the sale process, and considered a public flotation, before selling to the Scottish Media Group (now \"STV Group plc\") for £225 million in March 2000. The Scottish Media Group, which owned Scottish Television and the Herald newspaper, fought off other bidders including Clear Channel, NRJ and Guardian Media. Evans personally made £75 million out of the sale.\n\nEvans was subsequently fired by his new employer in 2001 for failing to report into work for five consecutive days while reportedly partying with his then wife Billie Piper.\n\nChief executive John Pearson, who had been with the station since before launch, resigned in April 2005, and was replaced by Fru Hazlitt, who had previously been managing director of Yahoo! UK and Ireland.\n\nOn 13 June 2006, SMG plc signed a deal with YooMedia to make Virgin Radio available on Freeview. It has always placed a great emphasis on other methods of transmission than medium wave, as the 1215 kHz frequency suffers from considerable interference, particularly after dark – BBC Radio 1, which used 1215 kHz for its first 11 years on air, moved to higher-quality medium wave frequencies (now used by talkSport) in 1978 mainly for this reason.\n\nOn 12 April 2007, it was announced that SMG plc was to sell Virgin Radio, to enable the company to focus on its television station, STV. On 30 May 2008 SMG sold Virgin Radio to TIML Golden Square Limited, a subsidiary of The Times Group for £53.2 million with £15 million set aside for rebranding. TIML was given 90 days grace in which to rebrand the station. As part of the deal, Absolute Radio International, operator of two FM licences in Oxford, would manage the station.\n\nOn 1 September 2008 it was announced that Virgin Radio would be rebranded as Absolute Radio at the end of the month (28 September). At the same time some changes to the line-up were made known with JK and Joel, Robin Burke, Tony Hadley and John Osborne leaving the station and Allan Lake, Joanna Russell (of Trent FM's Jo & Twiggy) and Tim Shaw joining, though Osborne would return shortly after.\nHowever, listening figures revealed for the final quarter of 2008 revealed that almost 20% of former Virgin Radio listeners had been lost since the rebranding to Absolute Radio.\n\nThe Virgin Radio brand, however, relaunched via DAB and online at 11:00am on 30 March 2016, following a new partnership with Wireless Group and its digital terrestrial commercial radio licence was approved by Ofcom in March 2015.\n\nOn 29 July 2013, Bauer Media Group announced it intended to purchase Absolute from current owner, The Times Group for an amount believed to be between £20m-£25m, pending regulatory approval of the sale. The deal was cleared by the Office of Fair Trading on 23 December.\n\nSubsequently, by September 2014, all other London-based Bauer stations permanently moved from Mappin House to a refurbished One Golden Square, creating a new national radio hub.\n\nOwner Bauer Radio announced in July 2015 that Absolute Radio would be taking up the 105.2 FM frequency in the West Midlands, previously held by Planet Rock. Absolute launched on 105.2 FM on 7 September 2015.\n\nVirgin Radio launched aiming at a target group of 24- to 44-year-olds and with a focus on album music, arguing that \"singles chart shows on Radio 1 and local commercial radio were outdated because albums outsold singles by three to one.\" It would provide a blend of recent album tracks and chart music from the past 25 years and aim to fill the \"hole in the middle\" between BBC Radio 1 and local commercial radio, which was specifically aimed at young audiences and \"gold\" stations offering classic hits.\n\nA year after launch, David Campbell was quoted as saying that \"the music policy was wrong, even though Virgin had lots of research to suggest it was doing what listeners said they wanted. We did something we should never do: pursue critical acclaim, playing obscure tracks, gaining the praise of the music press.\" The station's approach had been to mix in more familiar music.\n\nFru Hazlitt, when interviewed for \"The Guardian\" in September 2006, described the type of music the station championed: \"It's pretty much mainstream rock festival type music. Razorlight, Keane. These bands are becoming some of the biggest in the world.\"\n\nWhen announcing the rebrand as Absolute Radio on the One Golden Square blog, Clive Dickens, chief operating officer, noted that the station would be \"sticking with real music – not manufactured rubbish – and we're building on the amount of live music we do – we're just going to discover more of all of it.\"\n\nThe music policy continues to focus on guitar-based rock, mostly British. In a blog post in February 2009, Head of Music James Curran noted that the 30 most played artists in the first four months of Absolute Radio had been: Manic Street Preachers, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys, Snow Patrol, Kings of Leon, The Killers, Oasis, Travis, U2, Placebo, Suede, Kaiser Chiefs, Kasabian, Queen, Keane, Stereophonics, Caesars, Elbow, Bruce Springsteen, R.E.M., Nickelback, The Offspring, Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, Biffy Clyro, The Beatles, David Bowie, Nirvana, The Police and Blur.\n\n\n\nVirgin Radio's original line-up included Russ Williams, Richard Skinner, Mitch Johnson, Tommy Vance, Jonathan Coleman and Nick Abbot.\n\nOther past presenters on the network include Danny Baker, Robin Banks, Kelly-Anne Smith, Vicki Butler-Henderson, Robin Burke, Martin Collins, Gary Davies, Daryl Denham, Chris Evans (who also owned the station), Ben Jones, Neil Francis, Alan Freeman, Tony Hadley, Nicky Horne, Janey Lee Grace, Kevin Greening, Gary King, Jason King, Phil Kennedy, Jeremy Kyle, Allan Lake, Iain Lee, Geoff Lloyd, Tim Lovejoy, Pete Mitchell, Al Murray, Christian O'Connell, John Osborne, Lynn Parsons, Steve Penk, Annabel Port, Vic Reeves, Joel Ross, Jo Russell, Holly Samos, Harriet Scott, Tim Shaw, Graeme Smith, Suggs, David Tennant, Clive Warren, Ray Cokes and Dave Gorman.\n\nFrom the 2010–11 to the 2015–16 seasons, Absolute Radio broadcast live commentary of 32 Premier League games on Saturday afternoons. Ian Wright joined the station to host a post-match phone-in programme, as well as a regular music show on Absolute Radio 90s and a football podcast.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2014, Absolute Radio held UK radio rights to American football's National Football League.\n\nVirgin Radio and Absolute Radio broadcast from studios at 1 Golden Square since Virgin Radio's launch in 1993.\n\nThe 1215 kHz frequency (247 metres) was used, in selected areas only, by the BBC Light Programme until 1967. It was then used nationally as the original home of BBC Radio 1 until 22 November 1978, then from 23 November 1978 until 28 February 1992 by BBC Radio 3.\n\nIn a number of areas, particularly where the signals from the main 1215 transmitters overlap with each other, Absolute Radio uses filler transmitters on different frequencies. Below is a list of the AM transmitters in use by Absolute Radio (transmitters marked ** were turned off from May 2018; transmitters marked ∆ had their power reduced from May 2018):\n\nThe station is available on 105.8 FM from the Crystal Palace transmitting station in London and on 105.2 FM in the West Midlands from the Sutton Coldfield transmitting station.\n\nThe signal from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter is audible throughout a large part of the Midlands, including the counties of Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire. It can be heard with fairly decent quality down to Gloucester on the M5 motorway.\n\nIn the summer of 1993, Virgin Radio began broadcasting in stereo on the Astra 1A satellite on an audio sub-carrier of the Sky News channel. This service ceased on 1 July 2001 in anticipation of Sky's cessation of its analogue satellite service. Virgin Radio was one of the first 20 radio stations which joined the Sky Digital service on 20 November 1999. Carried on Astra 2A, it launched on the channel 917 of the Sky EPG, and can today be found as Absolute Radio on channel 0107.\n\nVirgin Radio launched its first website on 7 March 1996. Designed by AKQA, it hosted a live RealAudio stream, making it the first European radio station to stream 24-hours a day on the internet. The station went on to redesign the website a further six times as Virgin Radio. Streaming audio formats and presentation developed over time: QuickTime streaming was added in July 1999, an interactive media player launched in October 1999, an Ogg-Vorbis stream was launched in June 2003, and HE-AAC and Ogg-FLAC streams were launched in December 2009. In Autumn 2012 it launched the Opus Streaming Trial as part of the Listen Labs, including streams for all seven stations in 24, 64 and 96 kbit/s. This trial was cancelled without further notice in autumn 2014, along with the live webcams and the public playlist API.\n\nIn 2001, Virgin Radio joined the Measurecast and Arbitron internet broadcasting measurement services. Both measurement services have since closed. In 2009, Absolute Radio started publishing its internet listening and download statistics.\n\nVirgin Radio was also among the first to explore the opportunities for delivering its services to mobile phones. It took part in a joint venture with Ericsson in 1999 to investigate the use of third-generation (3G) mobile phone technologies for radio, launched a WAP site in 2000 and took part in a trial in 2001 with Crown Castle and Manx Telecom to explore the use of 3G phones to add interactivity to digital radio broadcasts. In 2009, Absolute Radio launched an application for the Apple iPhone and tagging for the Apple iPod Nano. In 2010 applications were released for the Amazon Kindle, the Nokia Ovi Store, the BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7 and Absolute Radio was selected as a launch partner for the Apple iAd mobile advertising network.\n\nIn January 2014, Absolute Radio Network has restricted the access to the internet radio on their own website to UK listeners only, and removed their apps for iPhone and Android in non-UK app stores. But it is still possible to access the internet radio outside the UK via the direct link or www.radioplayer.co.uk (which links to the official stream).\n\nA number of subsidiary stations to Virgin Radio and Absolute Radio have been launched as online and digital radio services over recent years, many being established during the period when SMG plc was in charge of the station. The stations were collectively known as the Virgin Radio Network (now the Absolute Radio Network). All 'Absolute' branded channels broadcast on DAB, the Internet, and digital television platforms; they are also now available as smartphone apps. The line-up of stations within the network has changed over time, and those currently on air are:\n\nA radio station on DAB, Virgin Media, Sky and the Internet playing classic rock from the sixties to the nineties. Launched as Virgin Radio Classic Rock in 2000 as part of SMG Radio strategy to trade total network listening hours at a time when analogue listening hours had been falling. The service was rebranded as Absolute Classic Rock in 2008.\n\nLaunched on 22 November 2011, Absolute 60s is the sixth radio station launched under the Absolute branding. The station is broadcast on DAB, some digital television networks, and online. The station has defined itself as \"the home of the Beatles, Stones and Mo-Town\".\nWith The Beatles and The Rolling Stones as highlights of the station's broadcasts, this will focus on music originating from the 1960s. Pete Mitchell is the main daytime presenter, returning to Golden Square: he was last on Virgin Radio in 2005 hosting the Breakfast show with Geoff Lloyd.\n\nLaunched on 29 November 2011, Absolute 70s is the seventh radio station launched under the Absolute branding. The station is broadcast on DAB and online.\nWith Rod Stewart, David Bowie and Prince as highlights of the station's broadcast, this will focus on music originating from the 1970s. Richard Skinner, another previous DJ from the Virgin Radio days, returned to Golden Square to feature on this station.\n\nA radio station on DAB, Freesat, Sky, Virgin Media and the Internet which plays classic hits, and is aimed at \"reluctant adults\" who want to reconnect with the tunes of their youth.\nAbsolute Radio 80s was launched on 4 December 2009.\n\nAbsolute Radio 90s launched on 21 June 2010 on DAB to a 13 million population in London, Essex, Wiltshire, Bristol, Berkshire and Bath. The station is also available on Sky 0201 and online via website and mobile smartphones.\n\nAbsolute Radio 00s launched on 10 December 2010 at 10 am online and on DAB Digital Radio in London. After an internet poll, the first song played was Mr. Brightside by The Killers.\n\ndabbl was a user-controlled music radio station broadcast on the Internet and selected local DAB multiplexes 24 hours a day, and on DAB in London from 7 pm to 6 am daily. Its content was chosen by members of Absolute's VIP Service, who select songs which are then voted for. Songs with the most votes are then broadcast. dabbl has now ceased, its DAB slots outside London taken by Absolute Radio 90s.\n\nA radio station on DAB, Virgin Media, Sky and the Internet which played motown, soul and disco music. Originally named \"The Groove\", it was rebranded as a Virgin Radio station in 2004 and closed at the end of 2007.\n\nLiquid was a station playing indie, alternative and Britpop. It ran on DAB in London between 2000 and 2004, with its slot taken by Virgin Radio Classic Rock (now Absolute Classic Rock).\n\nLaunched on 15 June 2006, Virgin Radio Party Classics played party pop music. The radio station was based on Suggs' \"Virgin Party Classics\" show broadcast on Virgin Radio. The station, which broadcast on Sky Digital and online, closed down on Friday 13 October 2006.\n\nA radio station on DAB, Virgin Media, Sky and the Internet, playing new music. Absolute Xtreme was launched (as Virgin Radio Xtreme) on 5 September 2005, by Lali Parikh (Station Manager) with Steve Harris being the main on air talent. On 4 December 2009, Absolute Xtreme was replaced on DAB and digital TV by Absolute Radio 80s.\n\nVirgin Radio Viva, which was due to launch on the new 4 Digital Group platform (which ultimately never launched), was due to be a popular music station aimed at 15- to 29-year-old females. It did not go ahead.\n\n\n"}

On either sides of the shield are a white pillar. At the top of the shield sits the rising sun. Winding around both columns and under the shield rests the Flag of Crimea, a blue–white–red tricolor ribbon, unto which the Motto of Crimea, \"Процветание в единстве\" (translated as \"Prosperity in unity\"), is inscribed.\n\nThe Varangian shield is symbolic of the fact that the region of Crimea was for a long time a crossing of major trade routes. The red field of the coat of arms symbolizes the intense history of Crimea. The griffin is placed on the coat of arms because it is commonly used to represent the territory north of the Black Sea, and is known as the \"coat of arms\" of Chersonesos and Panticapaeum, where one can see the griffin on artifacts from the area.\n\nAnother variation in the symbolism is that the pearl is symbolic of Crimea as a part of Earth, and the griffin as the defender of the young republic. The pearl's azure is reminiscent of the combined culture of Crimea. The white pillars are said to be reminiscent of the ancient civilizations which inhabited the peninsula. The rising sun is symbolic of prosperity and regeneration.\n\n\n"}

The team was sent there to aid in the damage assessment of the Tacloban airport and aid in the search for missing persons.\n\nThe aid contributions of China and the United States were given focus with regards to their involvement in the politics of the Philippines. Apart from having the two largest economies in the world, both countries are involved in a complex relationship with the island country. China is currently disputing the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea with the Philippines while the United States used to be an occupying power and currently has a mutual defense treaty with the islands.\n\nChina was initially criticized for its meager contribution of US $100,000 to the typhoon victims, which led to commentary about its disputes with the Philippines. Earlier in 2013, the Philippines sued China over the nine-dotted line. Commentators attribute this low amount to China's intentions to isolate the Philippines while strengthening its ties with the rest of Southeast Asia. The move had mixed reactions from the public of China with some commending its decision while others, such as \"The Global Times\", insisted that China should be a responsible power. China later increased its contributions to US$1.4 million and sent its naval hospital ship \"Peace Ark\" for disaster relief.\"\n\nThe contributions of the United States was in contrast to that of China. It gave the Philippines an amount of US$20 million worth of aid apart from deploying the United States Marines in order to assist with the humanitarian operations. This was seen by observers as part of the Asia pivot that the United States government had previously announced. The Philippine government had been discussing with the U.S. plans regarding the deployment of U.S. military troops within the country. Aid contributions of the U.S. was seen as a sign of goodwill in order to improve relations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10971939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10971939", "title": "Map database management", "text": "Map database management\n\nMap database management systems are software programs designed to efficiently store and recall spatial information. They are widely used in localization and navigation, especially in automotive applications. Moreover, they are playing an increasingly important role in the emerging areas of location-based services, active safety functions and advanced driver-assistance systems. Common to these functions is the requirement for an on-board map database that contains information describing the road network.\n\nWhen designed well, a map database enables the rapid indexing and lookup of a large amount of geographic data.\n\nMaps are stored as graphs, or two dimensional arrays of objects with attributes of location and category, where some common categories include parks, roads, cities, and the like.\n\nA map database represents a road network along with associated features. Map providers can choose various models of a road network as a basis to formulate a database. Commonly, such a model comprises basic elements (nodes, links and areas) of the road network and properties of those elements (location coordinates, shape, addresses, road class, speed range, etc.). The basic elements are referred to as features and the properties as attributes. Other information associated with the road network is also included, including points of interest, building shapes, and political boundaries. This is shown schematically in the adjacent image. Geographic Data Files (GDF) is a standardized description of such a model.\n\nEach node within a map graph represents a point location of the surface of the Earth and is represented by a pair of longitude (lon) and latitude (lat) coordinates. Each link represents a stretch of road between two nodes, and is represented by a line segment (corresponding to a straight section of road) or a curve having a shape that is generally described by intermediate points (called shape points) along the link. However, curves may also be represented by a combination of centroid (point or node), with a radius, and polar coordinates to define the boundaries of the curve. Shape points are represented by lon-lat coordinates as are nodes, but shape points do not serve the purpose of connecting links, as do nodes. Areas are two-dimensional shapes that represent things like parks, cities, blocks and are defined by their boundaries. These are usually formed by a closed polygon, which are shapes that indicated an object over a map has to have a close boundary, meaning the first polygon should be same as a last polygon. (For example, to plot a square object on a map, the polygons are 1,2,3,4,1.)\n\nAnother point for validation on data is the point in polygon, which helps in finding points lying outside a polygon. E.g., for a particular lon-lat coordinates in a city, if the point is intersecting the polygon in an odd number, then it is inside the polygon and a valid point; otherwise it is outside the polygon and invalid.\n\nMap providers generally collect, aggregate and supply data in a well-defined and documented file format that is specifically intended for information interchange, e.g. Navteq uses Standard Interchange Format (SIF) and GDF, while Tele Atlas uses a proprietary form of GDF. It is usually in a plain-text form (ASCII) consisting of fields that are easily parsed and interpreted by the various parties who will handle it. The portable format allows additions, deletions and modifications to be readily performed by simple text-editing programs.\n\nA small number of record types are used to represent the various types of data. Each record type consists of a sequence of fields, which are either fixed length or delimited by a punctuation character such as a comma. For example, a link entity could be represented by a record of the form:\n<br>type1,label,node1,z1,node2,z2,class,number of shape points,number of lanes,speed\n<br>where type1 defines this as a link record type and label serves as an identifier to distinguish this link from all others. The z1 and z2 fields determine the vertical separation of this link from others sharing the corresponding nodes node1 and node2. Thus an overpass to a link, for example, can be represented as not connected to that link. Other record types are used to represent address information, shape-points for a link, cities and states, points of interest (POI’s), etc.\n\nThe interchange format for a map database is not organized well for use by a navigation unit during runtime. Records are in an arbitrary order and therefore difficult to search and data, such as street names and coordinate values, are repeated from record to record. Consequently, the database content is reorganized into a binary form more suitable for run-time operation.\n\nRuntime formats are typically proprietary, preventing interoperation of maps between different navigation systems. However a new initiative called Navigation Data Standard (NDS) is an industry grouping of car manufacturers, navigation system suppliers and map data suppliers whose objective is the standardization of the data format used in car navigation systems. Companies involved include TomTom, BMW, Volkswagen, Daimler, Renault, ADIT, Alpine Electronics, Navigon, Bosch, DENSO, Mitsubishi, Harman Becker, Panasonic, PTV, Continental AG, Navteq and Zenrin.\n\nThe database is reorganized by a navigation provider through a compilation process that includes at least the following five steps:\n\n\nThe consistency check of step 1 is usually a very interactive and iterative process that might take weeks to complete. During this time discrepancies need to be detected, investigated and resolved.\n\nIn step 2, IDs are generally assigned sequentially as entities of each type are encountered. Any changes made to the input database from one version to another will affect the assignment of IDs to all entities. Consequently, there is little expectation of continuity in the assignment between versions.\n\nIn step 3 each applied index allows the database to be quickly searched in a specific manner. One index set applied to links can be sorted by the alphabetic order of the street names of the links. Another index set applied to links can be sorted according to the nodes to which they are connected to facilitate route planning. Yet another index set applied to nodes can be sorted according to their order of appearance along a road.\nIn some of these cases a binary search can be performed instead of an exhaustive search and in some cases, a search process can be replaced with a simple table lookup.\n\nFor most navigational functions it is important to have in the vehicle an up-to-date map database, and for some functions it is critical, especially those related to active safety. A common strategy is to transfer update information to the vehicle whenever it becomes available over a wireless channel. The wireless channel might be bi-directional, such as wifi and cellular phone, broadcast, such as satellite radio, FM sub-carrier or ATSC datacasting, or a combination of both. In any case it would be impractical or extremely inefficient to transmit the entire new database to replace an existing version, since it is likely to be several gigabytes in size.\n\nInstead it is desirable to transfer just that information related to changes made to the existing database. A major difficulty is that any change made to the content of a map database generally causes changes to all assigned entity IDs and all assigned indices during the compilation process. These new IDs and indices permeate the entire compiled database so that any collection of increments will likely constitute most of the database. To overcome this difficulty, three approaches have been taken, which are briefly 1) onboard compiler 2) look-aside store 3) geographical tiles.\n\nIn this case, basic changes made to the interchange format of the database are transmitted to the vehicle. Such changes are represented in transactional form consisting of \"additions\", \"deletions\" and \"replacements\". These changes are applied to the existing onboard database in interchange format. The interchange format for the onboard database could either be stored separately or generated as needed by “decompiling” the run-time format. The combined database is then compiled, which involves assigning IDs and applying indices.\n\nThis onboard compilation will likely be computationally intensive and require considerable memory. However, it does not need to be interactive and iterative as does the off-board compilation since consistency checks and resolution will have already been done. Furthermore, the onboard compilation can be done in the background so computation time is not critical.\n\nIn this case, basic changes are also transmitted to the vehicle, but are placed into a separate memory location called a \"look-aside store\". The changes are also represented in transactional form but may appear in any convenient format, which is not necessarily either interchange or run-time. During operation of the navigation unit, the look-aside store is searched each time the main database is accessed. Any transactions (changes) that pertain to the accessed data are then applied.\n\nThe necessity of examining the look-aside store and applying changes for each database access of course complicates the navigational algorithms and lengthens their computation time. However, this avoids the need for an onboard compiler.\n\nIn this approach, the map database is broken down into relatively small rectangular regions (tiles) that tessellate the map. The tile size is on the order of 1 km on a side. These tiles are compiled separately, so that all IDs and indices are conditioned by the particular tile to which they apply. The tiles that have changed due to basic entity or attribute changes to the database are transmitted to the vehicle, where they replace the corresponding existing tile.\n\nReplacing tiles is considerably simpler than onboard compilation or employing a look-aside store. However, it may not be efficient for transmission. A local change to entities and attributes, regardless of the extent, requires the transmission of the entire containing tile. Furthermore, there are edge effects in which a change in an entity within one tile affects the entities in neighboring tiles. It is quite possible that a small number of entity changes will require the transmission of almost all tiles, thereby defeating the purpose of incremental updates. These problems can be address by selecting the tile size and the frequency of updating.\n\nVarious navigational functions, involving active safety, driver assistance and location-based services require data that is not considered to be part of a map database and is likely supplied by a vendor other than that of the map provider. Such data needs to be cross-referenced with the entities and attributes of the main database. However, since the auxiliary data is not necessarily compiled with the main database some other means is needed to establish cross-referencing, which is referred to as \"attaching\" the auxiliary data. Two common approaches are function-specific referencing tables and generic referencing.\n\nFunction-specific referencing tables provide a means for attaching function-specific data to a map-data base produced by any participating supplier. Such a table is collaboratively produced to support a specific function or class of functions involving location-based service, active-safety or advanced driver assistance. It will generally consist of a list of map elements of a specific type (e.g., links, intersections, point-of-interest locations, etc.) along with identifying attributes (e.g., street names, longitude/latitude coordinates, etc.). Additionally, each entry in the table is assigned a unique identifier. The set of entries in a table are generally selected, through consensus of all interested parties. As a practical matter the result will represent a small subset of the elements of the given type that are available in the map databases and will consist of those that are more important to the application area. After a table is formulated, it is the task of each participating supplier to determine and cross-reference the elements in their map-database that correspond to the table entries.\nA widely used example is the TMC standard for location-code tables for referencing traffic data. TMC, which stands for Traffic Message Channel, is part of the Radio Data System (RDS), which is implemented as a sub-carrier modulation of a commercial FM broadcast signal. The TMC tables primarily provide references to point locations along major roads corresponding to intersections with other roads. A table entry identifies a point location using both contextual information (such as, region, road and section of road, name of intersection) and approximate longitude/latitude coordinates.\n\nIdentifiers assigned to entries in a table are 16-bit integers and therefore have a range of 65536 values. This is too few to cover the world, so separate tables are formulated for each country or region of a country. For a given metropolitan region, only intersections along freeways, arterials and some major roads are included. This is illustrated in the following figure for the Detroit metro area. The coverage is intended for providing traffic advisory information on high-use roads. Traffic-based route planning, on the other hand, requires coverage of all or almost all major roads and, therefore, is not adequately supported by TMC location code tables as they are currently formulated.\n\nGeneric referencing is an attempt to attach data to any map database by discovering reference information through a form of map matching. The function-specific data items are assigned to elements, such as points, links or areas, that likely only approximate the corresponding map elements in a specific map database. A search of the map database is made for the best fit. To enhance the search process neighboring elements are strategically appended to each given element to help ensure that the correct solution is found in each case. For example, if the map element is a link connecting two intersections, then one or both cross streets could be appended for the sake of the search. Hopefully, this makes an incorrect match unlikely. Although the procedure is quite heuristic, a proposed standard called Agora outlines the strategy for choosing neighboring elements to append.\n\nA European consortium called \"ActMAP\" (Actualize Map) is (in their words) \"developing standardised mechanisms to update existing map database content and enable dynamic attachment of information to the digital in-vehicle map\". The ActMAP consortium comprises ERTICO (coordinator), BMW, CRF Fiat Research Centre, DaimlerChrysler, Navigon, Navteq, Tele Atlas, and Siemens VDO Automotive. They have finished most of their work and published a number of reports, which were submitted to the ISO committee TC204 WG3 for standardization. Their reports serve as a good starting point and reference for the work of this project. An important issue their reports address is dealing with the complexity of multiple map suppliers, using proprietary formats, coupled with multiple data suppliers and multiple versions of in-vehicles maps. They resolve this by using an open intermediate map format expressed with XML and based on the concepts of the ISO standard GDF 4.0. All modifications to a supplier's database are first converted to this intermediate format, stored on a server and then converted to each format used within individual vehicles. They assume that each car has a \"baseline\" map from a map supplier and that this baseline defines reference identifiers (e.g. map segment ID) for most features to be updated. For features with no reference identifier in the baseline, they propose using a \"generic\" reference that is discovered heuristically using map matching as described by a proposed standard called \"AGORA\"\n\nA major issue not directly addressed by ActMAP is that for each new version of a supplier's map database all reference IDs are usually reassigned by a compiling process, which destroys any correspondence with IDs of previous versions. This seriously interferes with the ability to use incremental updates to generate a new version of a map database from a previous version. Another issue not resolved by ActMAP is the inability to reference and characterize subsections of road segments (for example, curves, hills, maneuver lanes, etc.) in order to update them.\n\n"}

It was launched in 1943 under the pretence of patrolling the Antarctic from German commerce raiders and U-boats that threatened Allied shipping during the course of World War II. The expedition resulted in the establishment of a number of bases, thus strengthening British territorial claims to the area. The expedition led to the collection of large amounts of rock, fossil and botanical specimens as well as meteorological, topographical data and glaciological measurements. Following its end in 1946, its mission was continued by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War II, Allied shipping across the globe became vulnerable to attacks by German Navy commerce raiders and U-boats. The British Falkland Islands and the waters of the Antarctic were no exception. On 13 January 1941, German auxiliary cruiser \"Pinguin\" began terrorizing the unarmed and unescorted Norwegian whaling fleet which had relocated to sub Antarctic waters after having depleted the whale population of the Northern Hemisphere through overexploitation. \"Pinguin\" managed to seize a haul of 20,320 ton of whale oil from whalers \"Solglimt\", \"Pelagos\" and \"Ole Wegger\", making it one of the largest prizes seized by a commerce raider during the war. Once whaler \"Thorshammer\" alerted the British authorities on the Falklands, the armed merchant cruiser HMS \"Queen of Bermuda\" began patrolling the area between South Georgia, the South Shetland Islands and Weddell Sea. On 5 March, it visited Deception Island where its crew set fire to a coal dumps and sabotaged oil tanks, supply and discharge pumps belonging to an abandoned Norwegian whaling station, to prevent their use as a supply base by the Germans.\n\nIn the meantime, the entry of Japan as another Axis power into the war through its surprise Attack on Pearl Harbor, created a new threat to British oversea possessions. The Falklands were protected by an insufficient force of 330 local volunteers with next to no weapons, making an amphibious Japanese invasion likely. Such an invasion would have made navigation around Cape Horn untenable and put Allied convoys heading to India and the Middle East in great danger. The war also threatened to reignite the long standing Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute with neutral Argentina. In January 1942, Argentina's Comisión Nacional del Antártico dispatched ARA \"Primero de Mayo\" to Deception Island, afterwards sailing to the Melchior Islands, Palmer Archipelago and Winter Island. Argentine flags were raised in the aforementioned locations and all territories south of 60° S and between 25° W and 68.34° W were declared annexed. On 28 January 1943, the Colonial Office proposed dispatching armed merchant cruiser to Deception Island after falsely claiming that a German commerce raider had been spotted in the area. Although by that time the threat of German commerce raiders had largely subsided, the deliberate ruse was enacted in order to conceal Britain's intentions from the U.S. and counter Argentina's ambitions. Upon reaching Deception Island Carnarvon's crew replaced the Argentinian flag with the Union Jack and placed four British Crown Land signs. A month later Primero de Mayo's men returned the favor. At this point it became obvious that only physical presence could settle the matter.\n\nPlanning for Operation Bransfield began on 27 May 1943. Named after Antarctic explorer Edward Bransfield it was quickly changed to Operation Tabarin (after Paris based cabaret Bal Tabarin) so as not to reveal its objectives. Polar experts Neil Mackintosh, James Wordie and Brian Roberts took up the planning of the endeavor. Experienced Scottish marine biologist and polar explorer Lieutenant James Marr was selected as the head of the expedition. Marr now a Lieutenant Commander flew to Iceland where he procured Norwegian sealer \"Veslekari\" which was assigned the name HMS \"Bransfield\".\nHe then went on to recruit the following expedition members:\n\"Bransfield\" proved to be unsuitable for the expedition as its freshwater tanks suffered from leaks, troopship HMS \"Highland Monarch\" was therefore selected as the replacement. On 14 December, \"Highland Monarch\" departed from Avonmouth, making stops at Gibraltar and Montevideo before reaching Port Stanley. There the expedition's members reembarked into \"Fitzroy\" and HMS \"William Scoresby\". At 11:00 a.m., 3 February 1944 the expedition landed at Port Foster, Deception Island. Much to the relief of its members the expedition found no signs of Argentinian presence in the port apart from a flag painted on a fuel tank. Orders had previously been issued to avoid confrontation with the Argentinians and the Chileans at all cost. The decrepit whaling station was transformed into Base B where Flett, Matheson, Smith, Layther and Howkins were to continue their work. On 6 February, the remainder of the expedition set course for Hope Bay where Station A was to be established.\n\nAt 13:00 p.m., 7 February \"William Scoresby\" dropped its anchor off Hope Bay. The following day Marr was informed that \"Fitzroy\" would not be able to proceed to Hope Bay as ice being blown into the area by easterly wind could potentially trap the ship. A plan to reload Fitzroy's cargo into Scoresby was discarded due to the latter's limited capacity. Abandoning Hope Bay on 10 February the two ships pushed south-west along Graham Land and to Port Lockroy once heavy fog lifted. Although it was known as a safe harbor, Port Lockroy's location restricted the range of scientific activities that the team intended to perform due to the fact that Gerlache Strait rarely froze, thus limiting access to the mainland. The ensuing ennui posed the risk of causing the team members to experience cabin fever as was the case in the Belgian Antarctic Expedition. The cargo was unloaded at Goudier Island the site of the newly established Station A. The first stage of the construction of the main hut christened Bransfield House was completed on 17 February, allowing \"William Scoresby\" and Fitzroy to return to the Falklands.\n\nOn 19 March, Station A was visited by \"William Scoresby\" which brought John Blyth a carpenter from the Falklands who join the team. On 23 March, the Port Lockroy post office began its operation with Farrington acting as censor. Falkland Island stamps overprinted with the inscription \"Graham Land, Dependency of\" were used. A day earlier four expedition members planted a Union Jack and a British Crown Land sign on Cape Renard. On 23 April, the Stanley post office burnt to the ground, with correspondence now passing through Montevideo the expedition's existence came to be known to the outside world. Survey work began in early May with the collection of rock samples from the foot of Jabet Peak and Savoia Peak. Lamb collected lichen samples and conducted experiments on the accumulation of snow and subsequent thawing. Lamb discovered a number of lichen species, including \"Verrucaria serpuloides\" the only known true marine lichen, thus making a considerable contribution to the taxonomy of Antarctic lichens. Later on Lamb visited Station B collecting specimens of amphipoda, ctenophora, sea urchins, worms and sponges from the beaches and shallow waters of Deception Island. On 18 November, a sledging expedition was launched on Wiencke Island where bird and lichen specimens were gathered, the former for the needs of the British Museum.\n\nOn 6 December, \"William Scoresby\" returned to Station B bringing plants native to the Falklands and soil for Lamb to conduct a transplantation experiment. Which ultimately failed due to low humidity and strong winds. On 3 February 1945, \"Fitzroy\" and 550 ton sealer \"Eagle\" arrived at Port Lockroy, with Victor Russell and David James, Norman Bertram Marshall, Gordon Lockley, Frank White, Alan Reece, Thomas Donnachie and Norman Layther aboard. Stores, equipment and crew members destined for the erection of an unmanned Base E on Stonington Island moved into \"Eagle\", others boarded \"William Scoresby\" and \"Fitzroy\" in order to build Station D on Hope Bay. On 7 February, Marr resigned on account of poor health, later returning to the Falklands, with Taylor replacing him as expedition leader. Taylor abandoned the plan to build the Stonington Island station focusing his attention on Station D. On 13 February, Seal Point was selected as the most suitable location for Station D and the first steps for its erection were made, construction was completed on 20 March. On 23 February, a hut was built on Coronation Island to reinforce British claims to the area. Later on the British paid the Argentinean meteorological station on Laurie Island a cordial visit.\n\nA few fossil specimens were collected at Hope Bay in February, with systematic gathering of paleobotanical specimens from Mount Flora's shale beginning on 8 June. A sledging expedition from Hope was launched in August. On 29 December, the sledging party returned to Base D, having visited Vortex Island, Duse Bay, James Ross Island and numerous small islands in its vicinity. The trip resulted in 250 kilos of lichen, fossil and rock samples, meteorological and glaciological measurements as well as corrections to Otto Nordenskjöld's maps. On 14 January 1946, \"William Scoresby\", \"Fitzroy\" and 300 ton sealer \"Trepassey\" began evacuating the members of the expedition to the Falklands. On 11 February, those serving in the military boarded while the rest sailed home on \"Highland Monarch\".\n\nThe end of World War II led to renewed interest in the Antarctic region. The U.S. refused to recognise any foreign territorial claims to Antarctica initiating Operation Highjump. Argentina and Chile signed the Argentine-Chilean Agreement on Joint Defence of \"Antarctic Rights\", a defence agreement that envisioned potential military action over disputed Antarctic lands. Chile organized its First Chilean Antarctic Expedition in 1947–48. Among other accomplishments, it brought the Chilean president Gabriel González Videla to personally inaugurate one of its bases, thereby becoming the first head of state to set foot on the continent. Britain on the other hand continued the operation of the bases built during Operation Tabarin, by transferring them to the newly established Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. Operation Tabarin veterans Reece,White and Rusell remained at their bases, continuing their work for the FIDS. Participants of Operation Tabarin were awarded the Polar Medal in 1953.\n\n"}
