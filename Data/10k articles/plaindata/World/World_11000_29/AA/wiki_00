These include bilateral relations between Canada and individual Asian states and multilateral relations through groups such as Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.\n\nCanada's relations with Asia stem from their respective colonial pasts, particularly with those countries who are also members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. This is because until the Balfour Declaration of 1926 Canada's foreign affairs were mainly handled by Britain. Canada also shares a colonial past with Asian countries previously under French rule, namely Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Prior to the establishment of bilateral ties between Asia and Canada, thousands of Chinese and Japanese immigrants arrived in Canada throughout the 19th century.\n\nDirect engagement with Asia began in 1919 with the formation of the League of Nations. Canada was one of the founding members, which also included the Asian states of China, Japan and Thailand, then known as Siam.\n\nThe 1923 Chinese Immigration Act banned all immigrants from China, except for those with the title of Diplomat, Merchant or Foreign student. The Act was repealed in 1947.\n\nIn 1929 Canada opened a legation in Tokyo.\n\nThe next significant interaction with Asia was the Canadian's involvement in fighting the Japanese in World War II. During the War the majority of Japanese-Canadians were placed in internment camps under the War Measures Act.\n\nCanada also partook in the Korean War.\n\nBilateral diplomatic ties with China were established in 1971, when the two countries exchanged ambassadors. This was followed by a 1973 visit to China by Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.\n\nToday, Asian Canadians comprise about 11.73% of Canada's total population.\n\nCanada's relations with Asia vary significantly between countries. For example, Canada has taken a number of political and economic measures against Burma, whose military government's policies it believes violate human rights. This is contrasted with warmer ties with countries like South Korea, with whom Canada has relaxed visa, educational and trade policies.\nCanada is one of 41 countries participating in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan, where Canada has been engaged in Security and Reconstruction efforts since 2002.\n\nCanada provides aid to many Asian countries, with a special focus on Afghanistan, Pakistan, Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh.\n\nCanada is a member of APEC, an intergovernmental forum dedicated to promoting free trade and investment, economic growth and development, and cooperation in the Asia–Pacific region.\n\nCanada maintains close ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations through the Joint Cooperation Workplan signed between the two parties.\n\nCanada, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos are all members of la Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.\n\nAsia's market share (the proportion of Canadian imports) in Canada accounts for 19.2%. 9.83% of total Canadian imports come from China and 3.53% come from Japan. Canada's market share in Asia is only 0.96%, creating a trade deficit. Due to its proximity to Asia across the Pacific Vancouver is the major port for Canada's trade with Asia. This has prompted the Canadian government's Asia–Pacific Gateway and Corridor Initiative.\n\nCanada is currently negotiating Free Trade Agreements with South Korea and Singapore and is engaged in discussions for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with India. It also has several Foreign Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements with Asian countries.\n\nAccording to the China Goes Global Survey conducted by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, Canada is poised to accept a greater share of Chinese investment, as Canada is seen by Chinese investors as having one of the most open attitudes to their presence.\n\n\n"}

Its recorded history reaches back to the settlement of Iceland.

His son Egill Skallagrímsson then continued to live and farm at Borg á Mýrum.\n\nBorg á Mýrum has had a church ever since Iceland was Christianised around the year 1000, shortly after Egill's death. The present church at Borg was built in 1880, and is notable for its geographical alignment: it faces North-South, which is not traditional for Icelandic churches. It is also unusual in that the church building does not stand in the church yard, but is separated from it by the farm buildings. \n\nThe altarpiece, depicting Christ blessing the little children, is unique in Iceland for being painted in Pre-Raphaelite style. The artist was W.G. Collingwood, who visited Iceland in 1897. Collingwood made an extensive trip around the country in preparation for an illustrated book he published on \"saga-steads\", the locations of the Icelandic Sagas.\n\nAt Borg á Mýrum Collingwood found 'the historical homestead, still partly built of oak-beams carved and moulded in the ancient times'. This building has not survived, but there is a twentieth-century monument to Egill by the sculptor Ásmundur Sveinsson. The abstract sculpture represents him as the poet of \"Sonatorrek\" in which he grieves for two of his sons, Gunnar and Böðvarr. \n\n\n"}

The constitutional system has influences from the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" and Roman customary law. It may have the oldest surviving constitution of any sovereign state in the world.\n\nThe current legal system of San Marino began on October 8, 1600. The government gave binding force to a compilation of \"Statuti\" written by Camillo Bonelli, covering the institutions and practices of Sammarinese government and justice at that time. It was written in Latin and contained in six books. The title in Latin is \"Statuta Decreta ac Ordinamenta Illustris Reipublicae ac Perpetuae Libertatis Terrae Sancti Marini\".\n\nThe new system was an update on the \"Statuti Comunali\" (Town Statute) which had served San Marino from about 1300. Existing institutions, such as the Council of the Sixty, were carried forward from this period. The Statutes form the basis of all law in effect today, so it may be the oldest constitution of any existing nation.\n\nThe first book contains 62 articles. It is constitutional in character and describes the various councils of San Marino, courts, a number of administrative positions, including the Captains-Regent, and the powers assigned to them. The last two articles explain how the law is to be interpreted and altered, including how the law is to be promulgated.\n\nThe second book, called \"Civilium Causarum\", contains 75 articles. The first half provides for civil law procedures covering subpoenas, evidence, examination of witnesses and judicial expenses. The second half covers minors, education, the salaries of the civil service and wills. There is a section which promotes compromise to resolve disputes and another which regulates the salary of lawyers.\n\nThe third book, called \"Maleficiorum\", contains 74 articles and covers criminal law. Prosecution of criminal acts is reserved for the state alone. The laws provide a formula by which a punishment shall be proportional to the offense and any mitigating circumstances. Special attention is given to protecting the assets of the state and church, and to preventing the pollution of water sources.\n\nThe fourth book, called \"De Appellationibus\", contains 15 articles. The volume explains how judges are nominated, the classification of sentences, appeals and appellant guarantees.\n\nThe fifth book, called \"Extraordinarium\", contains 46 articles covering a range of topics. These include the sale of meat, sanitation and health, water reserves and roads.\n\nThe sixth book contains 42 articles and covers compensation, weights and plant cultivation. In particular, it explains that family heads are responsible for the actions of their sons and any servants.\n\nOn 12 July 1974 the Captains-Regent signed a law (59/1974) adopted by the Grand and General Council containing a declaration of citizen rights and the fundamental principles of the juridical order of San Marino. The Declaration begins with a repudiation of war. It states the people are sovereign and explains how the separation of powers doctrine is applicable to San Marino. Citizens are guaranteed certain rights including equality, inviolability, freedom, and universal suffrage.\n\nJorri Duursma describes the 1974 law as the fundamental law of the Republic.\n\nThe Declaration was amended in 2002, providing further constitutional detail on the organisation of government and establishing the Guarantors’ Panel on the Constitutionality of Rules, which is a court responsible for assessing the compliance of laws with respect to the Declaration of Rights.\n\n\n"}

It carried strong anti-nationalist and pan-European sentiments. The party was established under the direction of the French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy, who visited the siege of Sarajevo in 1992 and was disturbed by what he saw. Upon returning to Paris, he delivered a plea for aid from the Bosnian President Alija Izetbegović directly to the French President François Mitterrand. The letter may have helped to spur Mitterrand's surprise visit to besieged Sarajevo in June 1992.\n\nAs the siege continued, Lévy became increasingly frustrated with Mitterrand's refusal to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, and founded the party in protest. Initial opinion polls showed the party polling at 12%, drawing votes from the centre left Parti Socialiste. However, shorty before the election, on 30 May, Levy announced that he was withdrawing from the race, claiming that he had achieved his goal of increasing awareness.

{"id": "965404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=965404", "title": "International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health", "text": "International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health\n\nThe International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a classification of the health components of functioning and disability.\nThe ICF received approval from all 191 World Health Organization (WHO) member states on May 22, 2001, during the 54th World Health Assembly. Its approval followed nine years of international revision efforts coordinated by WHO. WHO's initial classification for the effects of diseases, the \"International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps\" (ICIDH), was created in 1980.\n\nThe ICF classification complements WHO's International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD), which contains information on diagnosis and health condition, but not on functional status. The ICD and ICF constitute the core classifications in the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC).\n\nThe ICF is structured around the following broad components:\n\n\nFunctioning and disability are viewed as a complex interaction between the health condition of the individual and the contextual factors of the environment as well as personal factors. The picture produced by this combination of factors and dimensions is of \"the person in his or her world\". The classification treats these dimensions as interactive and dynamic rather than linear or static. It allows for an assessment of the degree of disability, although it is not a measurement instrument. It is applicable to all people, whatever their health condition. The language of the ICF is neutral as to etiology, placing the emphasis on function rather than condition or disease. It also is carefully designed to be relevant across cultures as well as age groups and genders, making it highly appropriate for heterogeneous populations.\n\nThere are benefits of using the ICF for both the patient and the health professional. A major advantage for the patient is the integration of the physical, mental, and social aspects of his or her health condition. All aspects of a person’s life (development, participation and environment) are incorporated into the ICF instead of solely focusing on his or her diagnosis. A diagnosis reveals little about one’s functional abilities. Diagnoses are important for defining the cause and prognosis, but identifying the limitations of function is often the information used to plan and implement interventions. Once a rehabilitation team is aware of the daily activities a client is required to participate in, the problem solving sequence set up by the ICF can be utilized. An occupational therapist, for example, would observe a patient performing his or her daily activities and note the patient's functional abilities. This information would then be used to determine the extent to which the individual’s abilities can be improved through therapy and to what extent the environment can be changed to facilitate the individual's performance. Intervention at one level (current abilities) has the potential to prevent or modify events at a succeeding level (participation). For example, teaching a deaf child manual signs will foster effective interaction and increase one’s participation with his or her family.\n\nRehabilitation therapists will be empowered with the ICF not only in their daily work with their patients, but also when working with other medical disciplines; hospitals and other health care administrations; health authorities and policy makers. All items are operationally defined with clear descriptions that can be applied to real life evaluations with clarity and ease. The language used in the ICF helps facilitate better communication between these groups of people.\n\nKnowing how a disease affects one’s functioning enables better planning of services, treatment, and rehabilitation for persons with long-term disabilities or chronic conditions. The current ICF creates a more integrative understanding of health forming a comprehensive profile of an individual instead of focusing on one’s disease, illness, or disability. The implications of using the ICF include an emphasis on the strengths of individuals, assisting individuals in participating more extensively in society by the use of interventions aimed at enhancing their abilities, and taking into consideration the environmental and personal factors that might hamper their participation.\nQualifiers: The ICF qualifiers “may be best translated clinically as the levels of functioning seen in a standardized or clinic setting and in everyday environments”. Qualifiers support standardization and the understanding of functioning in a multidisciplinary assessment. They enable all team members to quantify the extent of problems, even in areas of functioning where one is not a specialist. Without qualifiers codes have no inherent meaning. An impairment, limitation or restriction, is qualified from 0 (No problem; 0-4%), 1 (Mild problem: 5-24%), 2 (Moderate problem: 25-49%), 3 (Severe problem: 50-95%) to 4 (Complete problem: 96-100%). Environmental factors are quantified with a negative and positive scale denoting the extent to which the environment acts as a barrier or facilitator. For insurance purposes, the qualifiers can describe the effectiveness of treatment. One can interpret the decreasing of a qualifier score to be an increase in the functional ability of a patient.\n\nAn ICF Core Set can serve as a reference framework and a practical tool to classify and describe patient functioning in a more time efficient way. ICF Core Sets can be used along the continuum of care and over the course of a health condition. The ICF classification includes more than 1,400 categories limiting its use in clinical practice. It is time consuming for a clinician to utilize the main volume of the ICF with his or her patients. Only a fraction of the categories is needed. As a general rule, 20% of the codes will explain 80% of the variance observed in practice. ICF Core Sets contain as few as possible, but as many ICF categories as necessary, to describe a patient’s level of functioning. It is hypothesized that using an ICF Core Set will increase the inter-rater reliability when coding clinical cases as only the relevant categories for a particular patient will be utilized. Since all of the relevant categories are listed in an ICF Core Set, its use in multidisciplinary assessments protects health professionals from missing important aspects of functioning.\n\nAs clinicians and researchers used the ICF, they became more aware of its limitations. The ICF lacks the ability to classify the functional characteristics of a developing child. Different ICF codes are needed across the first years of a child’s life to capture the growth and development of a disability even when the child's diagnosis does not change. The coding system can provide essential information about the severity of a health condition in terms of its impact on functioning. This can serve a significant role for providers caring for children with spectrum disorders such as autism or cerebral palsy. Children with these conditions may have the same diagnoses, but their abilities and levels of functioning widely vary across and within individuals over time. \nThe first draft of the \"International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth\" (ICF-CY) was completed in year 2003 and published in 2007. The ICF-CY was developed to be structurally consistent with the ICF for adults. A major difference between the ICF-CY and ICF is that the generic qualifiers from the adult ICF now include developmental aspects for children and youth in the ICF-CY. Descriptions of codes in the ICF-CY were revised and expanded and new content was added to previously unused codes. Codes were added to document characteristics as adaptability, responsivity, predictability, persistence, and approachability. “Sensing” and “exploration of objects” codes were expanded as well as the “importance of learning”. Since a child’s main occupation is playing, it is also important to include more codes in this area. Different levels of play have separate codes in the ICF-CY (solitary, onlooker, parallel). This contrasts with the adult ICF as only one code existed in regards to leisure or recreation.\n\nChanges in ICF-CY codes over time reflect developmental effects attributable to the child’s interaction with the environment. Environmental factors influence functioning and development and can be documented as barriers or facilitators using the ICF-CY. The key environments of children and adolescents include their homes, day care centers, schools and recreation settings of playground, parks, and ball fields. Children will transition between different environments many times as they grow. For example, a child will transition into elementary or high school or from one service setting or agency to another. Attention to these transitions of children with disabilities has been identified as an important role for health care providers. A transition requires preparation and planning to find an appropriate and accommodating setting for a child’s needs. With a coding system such as the ICF-CY, the transition will be smoother and interventions can start where the previous health provider left off.\n\n\n\n"}

He entered the Royal French army as a second lieutenant in the engineering school of Mézières in 1766.\n\nAt the time of the French Revolution, Dejean embraced the principles of moderate reform. His talents in military administration gained him rapid advancement through the ranks of the army engineers. He replaced Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville as commander of the \"Army of the North\" on 16 September 1796 and his tenure lasted until 24 September 1797 when he handed the assignment back to Beurnonville.\n\nDejean performed a variety of important missions as a consulate, including to Genoa, where he lived for nearly two years with the title of minister extraordinary. He was recalled to Paris in 1802 to take the portfolio of Minister of War Administration (a position he held until 1809). Shortly before his retirement from the ministry, he was promoted to the rank of chief inspector-general of fortifications. The Emperor Napoleon soon afterwards made him a senator and a \"Trésorier de la légion-d'honneur\" (treasurer of the Legion of Honour).\n\nAfter the abdication of Napoleon in 1814, Dejean joined the Provisional Government, and performed the difficult task of extraordinary commissioner to Comte d'Artois (the future Charles X). He was also appointed, a Peer of France, Governor of L'Ecole Polytechnique and Chairman of the Committee for the Liquidation of Arrears. But in 1815, having accepted service under Napoleon Bonaparte during the Hundred Days, he was removed from all public offices on return of the Bourbon regime.\n\nIn 1819 Dejean returned to the \"Chambre des Pairs\" (French House of Lords), where he consistently supported the liberal opposition. He died on 12 May 1824.\n\nAttribution:\n"}

Burawoy was also president of the American Sociological Association in 2004 and is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In 2006–2010, he was vice-president for the Committee of National Associations of the International Sociological Association (ISA). In the XVII ISA World Congress of Sociology he was elected President of the International Sociological Association (ISA) for the period 2010–2014.\n\nGraduating as a mathematics student from the University of Cambridge in 1968, Burawoy went on to pursue post-graduate study in the newly independent African nation of Zambia, while simultaneously working as a researcher for Anglo American PLC.

His work on public sociology is most prominently shown in his presidential address to the American Sociological Association in 2004, where he divides sociology into four separate (yet overlapping) categories: public sociology, policy sociology (which has an extra-academic audience), professional sociology (which addresses an academic audience familiar with theoretical and methodological frameworks common to the discipline of sociology), and lastly critical sociology which, like public sociology, produces reflexive knowledge but which is only available to an academic audience, like professional sociology.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
