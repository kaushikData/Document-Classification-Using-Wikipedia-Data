Chiara sings to her lover that, no matter what, she will be \"your angel\". The chorus culminates with the line \"I'm always here for you\".\n\nIn keeping with the lyrical simplicity of the song, Chiara performed solo onstage with a simple musical score backing her.\n\nAs Malta had finished the 2004 Contest in the top 12, the song was pre-qualified for the final. Here, it was performed third, following the United Kingdom's Javine with \"Touch My Fire\" and preceding Romania's Luminiţa Anghel & Sistem with \"Let Me Try\". At the close of voting, it had received 192 points placing 2nd in a field of 24 and pre-qualifying Malta for the final at the next Contest. In the voting, Malta received only one 12-point set, from Russia, a low number for a Eurovision runner-up.\n\nThe result was also Malta's best in Contest history, equalling Ira Losco's second place with \"7th Wonder\" but exceeding that song's score of 164 points (and indeed Chiara's own score of 165 with \"The One That I Love\"). \"Angel\" managed to peak at #95 on the German Singles Chart Top 100.\n\nThe song appeared as a \"favourite\" on the CD and DVD sets produced to commemorate the Congratulations special in late 2005.\n\nIt was succeeded as Maltese representative at the 2006 Contest by Fabrizio Faniello with \"I Do\".\n\nThe song has gained popularity in many countries.

It was convened to discuss sustainable development by the United Nations. WSSD gathered a number of leaders from business and non-governmental organizations, 10 years after the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. (It was therefore also informally nicknamed \"Rio+10\".)\n\nThe Johannesburg Declaration was the main outcome of the Summit; however, there were several other international agreements.\n\nIt laid out the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation as an action plan.\n\nJohannesburg, 27 August: agreement was made to restore the world's depleted fisheries for 2015. It was agreed to by negotiators at the World Summit. \n\nInstead of new agreements between governments, the Earth Summit was organized mostly around almost 300 \"partnership initiatives\" known as Type II, as opposed to Type I Partnerships which are the more classic outcome of international treaties. These were to be the key means to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. These are kept in a database of Partnerships for Sustainable Development.\n\nThe absence of the United States rendered the summit partially impotent. George W. Bush boycotted the summit and did not attend. Except for a brief appearance by Colin Powell, who hurriedly addressed the closing stages of the conference while his airplane taxied on the runway of Johannesburg International, the US government did not send a delegation, earning Bush praise in a letter from conservative organizations such as Americans for Tax Reform, American Enterprise Institute, and Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\nThe United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, was first held in Stockholm, Sweden, in June 1972, and marked the emergence of international environmental law. The Declaration on the Human Environment also known as the Stockholm Declaration set out the principles for various international environmental issues, including human rights, natural resource management, pollution prevention and the relationship between the environment and development. The conference also led to the creation of the United Nations Environment Programme.\n\nThe Brundtland Commission set up by Gro Harlem Brundtland, the pioneer of sustainable development, provided the momentum for first Earth Summit 1992 – the United Nations Conference on Environmental Development (UNCED), that was also headed by Maurice Strong, who had been a prominent member of the Brundtland Commission – and also for Agenda 21.\n\nSouth Africa's first National Conference on Environment and Development entitled, \"Ecologise Politics, Politicise Ecology\" was held at the University of the Western Cape in conjunction with the Cape Town Ecology Group and the Western Cape Branch of the World Conference on Religion and Peace in 1991. Prominent persons involved in this conference were Ebrahim Rasool, Cheryl Carolus, Faried Esack, and Julia Martin.\n\nThe initial informal discussions on a possible new Summit in 2002 were held in February 1998 and hosted by Derek Osborn who co-chaired the preparatory meetings for Rio+5 and Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future. A set of 10 governments started working informally to start putting together the possible agenda for a Summit. the non-papers produced in 1998 and 1999 ensured that when the UN Commission met in 2000 it could agree to host another Summit in 2002.\n\n\n"}

Fairbanks is the smallest city in the United States with non-stop service to Europe, as Condor offers weekly flights to Frankfurt during the summer tourist season. In addition, Air North is another international airline with flights (to Canada) and Antonov Airlines offers cargo flights to South Korea.\n\nThe airport opened in 1951 and took over existing scheduled airline traffic to Fairbanks, which had previously used Ladd Army Airfield. Alaska Airlines used Fairbanks as its main hub in the 1950s, with service to Seattle and Portland as well as intrastate service to Anchorage, Nome and other destinations. By 1967, however, the airline shifted its Alaska hub to Anchorage; its Anchorage-Fairbanks service continues to this day. In the mid-1970s, following the development of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, Alaska Airlines and Braniff International offered \"interchange service\" between Fairbanks and Houston via Anchorage, Seattle and Dallas. In 1982, following airline deregulation, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines began a similar interchange service using Boeing 727s.\n\nPan American World Airways had also served Fairbanks since 1932. The station was originally opened after the acquisition of Pacific International Airways and used for short-haul services to Juneau, Seattle, Ketchikan, Whitehorse and other destinations. Pan Am intended to use Fairbanks as a stop for service to Asia as early as 1931, but initial difficulty in negotiating landing rights with the Soviet Union, followed by the outbreak of World War II, delayed these plans until decades later. Pan Am service to Fairbanks continued through the opening of FAI until 1965, when the Civil Aeronautics Board terminated Pan Am's rights to serve Alaska.\n\nPan American World Airways eventually used Fairbanks as a stopover for transpacific service from New York and Seattle to Tokyo starting in September 1969. In 1974, Pan Am agreed to transfer its Fairbanks-Seattle service to Western Airlines, and requested that the CAB allow its New York-Tokyo service to be suspended from April 1975. Other carriers such as Japan Airlines and Korean Air began to use Fairbanks as a technical stop for transpacific cargo flights in the late 1970s.\n\nOn October 11, 2009, the airport constructed a new terminal and demolished the old terminal which was built in 1948. The new terminal is built around the modern TSA standards. In addition to architectural design and better security, the main terminal now has six jet-bridges (up from the former five). The 2,700m of custom unitised curtain wall was designed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd. Hong Kong. The special design incorporated double low-\"e\" triple glazing. The new building's footprint is smaller than the old building.\n\nFor the 12-month period ending February 28, 2018, the airport had 119,898 aircraft operations, an average of 328 per day: 58% general aviation, 31% air taxi, 9% scheduled commercial, and 2% military. At that time there were 569 aircraft based at this airport: 91% single-engine, 8% multi-engine, <1% jet and <1% helicopter.\n\nThe terminal building, situated on the southwest side of the airport, contains seven gates: two for commuter carriers and five for larger carriers.\n\nFairbanks International Airport covers an area of 3,470 acres (1,404 ha) at an elevation of 439 feet (134 m) above mean sea level.

He led missions to Satsuma Domain multiple times.\n\nIn the spring of 1609, Satsuma invaded Ryukyu and captured the strategically important Nakijin Castle. Kikuin went there to request a peace negotiation together with a Japanese tea master named Kian, but they were arrested by Satsuma troops. After the war, he was taken to Kagoshima Castle together with King Shō Nei and a number of high officials by Satsuma troops. After \"sessei\" Gushichan Chōsei died at Sunpu Castle, he served as acting \"sessei\".\n"}

{"id": "9603757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9603757", "title": "Sirius XM Satellite Radio", "text": "Sirius XM Satellite Radio\n\nSirius XM Holdings, Inc., doing business as Sirius XM Satellite Radio, is a broadcasting company headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City that provides three satellite radio and online radio services operating in the United States: Sirius Satellite Radio, XM Satellite Radio, and Sirius XM Radio. The company also has a minor interest in SiriusXM Canada, an affiliate company that provides Sirius and XM service in Canada. At the end of 2013, Sirius reorganized their corporate structure, which made Sirius XM Radio Inc. a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc.\n\nSirius XM Radio was formed after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the acquisition of XM Satellite Radio Holding, Inc. by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. on July 29, 2008, 17 months after the companies first proposed the merger. The merger brought the combined companies a total of more than 18.5 million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging. The deal was valued at $3.3 billion, not including debt. Through Q2 2017, SiriusXM has more than 32 million subscribers.\n\nThe proposed merger was opposed by those who felt a merger would create a monopoly. Sirius and XM argued that a merger was the only way that satellite radio could survive.\n\nIn September 2018, the company agreed to purchase the competing streaming music service, Pandora.\n\nSirius Satellite Radio was founded by Martine Rothblatt, David Margolese, and Robert Briskman. In 1990, Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio in Washington, DC. The company was the first to petition the FCC to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast, which \"provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [terrestrial] radio stations.\" In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as chairman and CEO to start a medical research foundation. Former NASA engineer Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO. Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000. In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and \"effectively created the industry,\" the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius' example. In November 1999, marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company, this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology. Having secured installation deals with automakers, including BMW, Chrysler and Ford, Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002, expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.\n\nIn November 2001, Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him \"for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry.\" Joe Clayton, former CEO of Global Crossing, followed as CEO from November 2001 until November 2004; stayed on as chairman until July 2008. Mel Karmazin, former president of Viacom, became CEO in November 2004 and remained in that position through the merger, until December 2012.\n\nThe origin of XM Satellite Radio was a Petition for Rulemaking filed at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by regulatory attorney and Founder of Satellite CD Radio Martine Rothblatt, to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the world's first-ever Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS). On May 18, 1990, Satellite CD Radio, Inc. (SCDR) filed a Petition for Rule Making in which it requested spectrum to offer Compact Disc quality digital audio radio service to be delivered by satellites and complementary radio transmitters. Following the Allocation NPRM, the FCC established a December 15, 1992 cut-off date for applications proposing satellite DARS to be considered in conjunction with CD Radio's application. One such application came from American Mobile Radio Corporation (AMRC), the predecessor company to XM Satellite Radio. XM Satellite Radio was founded by Lon Levin and Gary Parsons. It has its origins in the 1988 formation of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC), a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals. In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the American Mobile Radio Corporation, dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1998. Its planned financing was complete by July 2000, at which point XM had raised $1.26 billion and secured installation agreements with General Motors, Honda, and Toyota. Initially scheduled for September 12, 2001, XM's service start date was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. XM Satellite Radio's first broadcast was on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius.\n\nGary Parsons served as chairman of XM Satellite Radio from its inception through the merger, and resigned from the position in November 2009. Hugh Panero served as XM's CEO from 1998 until July 2007, shortly after the merger with Sirius was proposed. Nate Davis was appointed interim CEO until the merger was completed, at which point Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin took over as CEO of the newly merged company, Sirius XM.\n\nAfter years of speculation (the \"New York Post\" first reported on a potential merger in January 2005) and three months of serious negotiations, the $13 billion merger between Sirius and XM was officially announced on February 19, 2007. At the time, the nation's only two satellite radio providers reported nearly 14 million combined subscribers (with nearly 8 million belonging to XM), with neither having turned an annual profit. Sirius was valued at $5.2 billion, and XM at $3.75 billion. Each subscription was sold for $12.95 monthly.\n\nXM and Sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs. According to their original operating licenses, the two companies were not allowed to ever own each other's license. In proceeding with the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin ignored this rule, gambling that the FCC would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule.\n\nAfter a 57-week review process, the U.S. Justice Department approved the Sirius and XM merger on March 24, 2008, concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio, online streaming, and mp3 players and tablets. On July 25, 2008, the FCC approved the merger with a 3–2 vote, determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the Internet. FCC chairman Kevin Martin stated, \"The merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices.\"\n\nThe biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the US, the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio, as well as online radio-streaming competition. Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and paying $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations. Sirius and XM began merging their channels on November 12, 2008.\n\nEach share of XM stock was replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius stock. Each company's stockholders initially retained approximately 50% of the joined company.\n\nAt the time of the merger, Sirius' top programming included channels for Howard Stern, and Martha Stewart; live NBA and NFL games; and live NASCAR races. XM's programming included channels for Willie Nelson, Opie and Anthony, Snoop Dogg, and Oprah Winfrey; and live Major League Baseball games.\n\nThe National Association of Broadcasters was adamantly opposed to the merger, calling it a monopoly. Shortly after the Justice Department gave its support to the merger without restrictions, attorneys general from 11 states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington) urged the FCC to impose restrictions on the merger. Several Congressional Democrats also opposed the merger, calling it anticompetitive and criticizing the Bush administration for allowing it to go through.\n\nAfter coming close to filing for Chapter 11 only months after the 2008 merger, having gone so far as to hire lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing, Sirius XM was able to avoid declaring bankruptcy with the assistance of a $530 million loan from Liberty Media in February 2009, which Mel Karmazin negotiated in exchange for a 40% equity stake in Sirius XM.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2009, Sirius XM posted a profit for the first time, with a net income of $14.2 million. This came after net losses of $245.8 million in the year following the merger. The company's resurgence was owed in part to the loan from Liberty Media. Increased automobile sales in the US was also a factor. Sirius XM ended 2009 with 18.8 million subscribers. By the end of 2012, Sirius XM's subscriber base had grown to 23.9 million, mostly due to an increase in partnerships with automakers and car dealers; a strong push in the used-car market; and continued improved car sales in the US in general. The renewal of radio show host Howard Stern's contract through 2015 ($400 million for five years, $100 million less than Stern's previous five-year deal) was also a factor in the company's steady growth; Stern's show attracted over 12 million listeners per week.\n\nAs of 2017, Sirius XM had approximately a 75% penetration rate in the new car market. Out of that 75%, approximately 40% become subscribers. SiriusXM is available in vehicles from every major car company as well as in assorted trucks, boats and aircraft. The company offers trial subscriptions to new car owners, and then offers customers a variety of subscription options. There are more than 100 million cars on the road with SiriusXM radios installed.\n\nAfter trying for four years, on December 21, 2010, Sirius XM received approval from the FCC to add service in Alaska and Hawaii. Sirius XM announced on January 17, 2011 that it would place repeaters in those states and adjust three of its satellites to cover those areas. The move gave Sirius XM coverage in all 50 states.\n\nOn January 12, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc. On April 11, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the merger of Sirius and XM's Canadian affiliates in SiriusXM Canada.\n\nOn April 11, 2013, a New York appeals court upheld a New York judge's ruling, from April 2012, that Howard Stern was not entitled to stock bonuses based on Sirius XM's exceeding subscriber target projections. The court ruled that subscribers to XM Satellite Radio from before the Sirius XM merger should not be counted as \"Sirius subscribers\" for the purposes of Stern's lawsuit. Stern argued the opposite, because his popularity had played an integral role in helping Sirius acquire XM. He had been seeking $330 million in stock bonuses.\n\nIn 2017, SiriusXM surpassed 32 million subscribers.\n\nOn September 24, 2018, Sirius XM announced its intent to acquire Pandora for $3.5 billion.\n\nFollowing the merger, Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin became CEO of the combined company, and XM chairman Gary Parsons retained his role. XM CEO and co-founder Hugh Panero stepped down in August 2007, shortly after the merger was first announced.\n\nXM Satellite Radio executives who were not offered jobs in the new combined company were assured golden parachute severance packages that had been approved in 2007. Former CEO Nate Davis received a severance package worth $10 million. Erik Toppenberg, executive vice president of programming, received a severance package worth $5.34 million. CFO Joseph Euteneuer received a severance package worth $4.9 million. Vernon Irvin, chief marketing officer, received a severance package worth $4.5 million.\n\nIn November 2009, Parsons resigned as chairman of Sirius XM, receiving a payout of more than $9 million. He was succeeded by Eddy Hartenstein, former publisher and CEO of the \"Los Angeles Times\". In December 2012, Mel Karmazin stepped down as Sirius XM CEO after Liberty Media gained control of 49.5% of the company. James E. Meyer was named interim CEO. On April 30, 2013, he was named permanent CEO. Also in April 2013, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei was named Sirius XM's chairman, succeeding Hartenstein.\n\nSirius XM radio content is available to stream online either as an add-on to existing subscriptions or as an Internet-only option. Internet and mobile services directly challenging Sirius XM include iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Spotify.\n\nIn August 2011, SiriusXM announced that the company would start offering a personalized interactive online radio experience. MySXM debuted on April 15, 2013, allowing users to fine-tune over 50 existing Sirius XM channels. MySXM is available to all Sirius XM subscribers.\n\nThe internet player allows subscribers to customize most stations to their liking by adjusting settings like: familiar/hits or unfamiliar/depth, studio recordings or live performances, and new/recent or old/classic material. These customized stations also allow listeners to play music without DJ interruptions. SiriusXM apps also include an extensive lineup of archived programming on SiriusXM On Demand.\n\nOn June 17, 2009, Sirius XM released an application for use on Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch, allowing its subscribers to listen to its programming on those devices. The app did not feature all of the programming available to satellite listeners. On March 17, 2011, the app was also made available for the iPad. In 2012, the app was updated for iOS and Android, featuring additional content, and the ability to pause, rewind, and fast-forward through audio streams.\nOn February 4, 2010, the Sirius XM BlackBerry application was announced, for use on BlackBerry smartphones (the Bold, Curve, Storm, and Tour). As of April 2013, the app featured over 150 channels.\n\nOn May 28, 2010, the Sirius XM application for Android smartphones was announced. As of April 2013, the app features over 130 channels.\n\nAs part of Howard Stern's new five-year contract with Sirius XM, which he signed on December 9, 2010, \"The Howard Stern Show\", which hadn't previously been made available on mobile devices, would now be a part of Sirius XM's mobile app package.\n\nOn March 18, 2015, SiriusXM released a refreshed user interface of the application on Android and iOS.\n\nAs of October 2017, SiriusXM is available for streaming via custom apps on a variety of connected devices including Amazon Alexa and Fire TV, Sonos, PlayStation, Roku, and smart TVs.\n\nIn May 2018, SiriusXM unveiled a new look for both the desktop web player and the mobile apps. The MySXM feature, including all the custom mixes that listeners saved overtime, was removed. SiriusXM claims that they're working on a more personalized feature that will release in the upcoming months.\n\nFollowing the merger, Sirius XM began offering numerous new options, including \"a la carte\" offerings, a family-friendly version, and \"mostly music\" or \"news, sports, and talk\" packages, ranging in price from $6.99 to $16.99 per month. As of April 2013, almost all music, talk and news programming is available on both Sirius, XM and SiriusXM Internet Radio services.\n\nPrior to the merger, Sirius offered, for a one-time fee, a lifetime subscription (lasting the lifetime of the receiver, not the subscriber). After the merger, due to changes in bundling policies, some customers who had purchased lifetime subscriptions had their service reduced or canceled, and were unable to obtain a refund.\n\nSiriusXM Marine weather offers three satellite-based marine weather subscription packages, including Marine Inland, Marine Coastal and Marine Offshore, ranging in price from $12.99 to $54.99 per month. Marine Inland provides essential, localized weather information every inland and freshwater angler and boater should have when on the water including NEXRAD Storm Cell Attributes, Weather Radar, Lightning, Alerts and Watch Boxes, 5 Day Forecasts, Wind data and more. Marine Coastal includes all Inland package features plus Wind & Wave Forecasts including the Great Lakes, Marine Zone Forecasts, Coastal Sea Surface Temps, Buoy data and more. Marine Offshore includes all of the Coastal package features plus Offshore Sea Surface Temps, extended Weather, Wind and Wave Forecasts, US & Canadian Alerts, etc.\n\nSiriusXM Aviation weather offers four satellite-based aviation weather subscription packages, including Pilot Express, Pilot For ForeFlight, Pilot Preferred, and Pilot Pro, ranging in price from $34.99 to $99.99 per month. Pilot Express delivers useful weather information for all pilots, with U.S. radar extending into southern Canada, Cloud-to-Cloud and Cloud-to-Ground Lightning, TAFs, METARs, AIRMETs/SIGMETs-Graphical, AIREPs/PIREPs, weather observations and warnings. Pilot For ForeFlight delivers SiriusXM’s most requested aviation weather features to Pilots using ForeFlight software on their iOS devices, such as iPad and iPhone. Pilots will find essential weather features right at their fingertips, includes all Pilot Express package features plus METARs/TAFs-Non-CONUS, Cloud Top Image, Echo Top Raster, Graphical Turbulence Guidance. Pilot Preferred includes all Pilot For Foreflight package features plus 0-24 Hr Weather Map with Surface Features & Isobars, Surface Visibility Forecast, etc. Pilot Pro is the most comprehensive package includes all Pilot Preferred package features plus 0–48 Hr Weather Map with Surface Features & Isobars. Pilot Pro is popular with those who fly frequently, on long routes or at high altitudes.\n\nOn December 4, 2014, Sirius XM Holdings agreed to a $3.8 million USD settlement with 45 states and the District of Columbia, over a suit initiated by the Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine, stemming from the company's billing and service renewal practices. The suit alleged Sirius XM Holdings was engaged in \"misleading, unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of state consumer protection laws,\" Attorney General DeWine said.\n\nSiriusXM is the exclusive home to Howard Stern with two dedicated Howard Stern channels. SiriusXM’s talk, news and comedy programming features channels from news outlets including BBC, CNBC, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Bloomberg, NPR, C-SPAN, exclusive talk and entertainment channels including TODAY Show Radio, Business Radio Powered By The Wharton School, Entertainment Weekly Radio, Faction Talk, Radio Andy, Joel Osteen Radio, and comedy from channels including Comedy Central Radio, Comedy Greats, The Foxxhole, Laugh USA, Raw Dog Comedy and George Carlin’s Carlin’s Corner.\n\nSiriusXM music programming includes artist branded channels from The Beatles, Bruce Springsteen, Eminem, Garth Brooks, Tom Petty, Pearl Jam, Kenny Chesney, Pitbull and many more, curated music channels dedicated to multiple decades and genres that span rock, pop, country, electronic dance, jazz and more, and concept-based channels curated by SiriusXM’s acclaimed programming team, such as The Coffee House, SiriusXM Chill, Road Trip Radio, Yacht Rock Radio, and The Covers Channel.\n\nSiriusXM offers live play-by-play coverage of every NFL, Major League Baseball, and NBA game; every NASCAR race; NHL games; PGA Tour events; and live college sports, as well as news, analysis and opinions from more than a dozen dedicated sports talk channels.\n\nIn Canada, Sirius Canada and XM Canada were partially owned by Sirius XM (20% and 23.3% respectively) in joint ventures with Canadian companies. After the US merger, the two Canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger, but instead remained in competition as distinct services. Complicating matters was that Sirius Canada has nearly 80% of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country, and felt they deserved greater than a 50/50 split of the new company, whereas XM Canada felt their deal with the NHL—a particularly lucrative prize in Canadian sports broadcasting—also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company.\n\nOn November 24, 2010, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada announced that they would merge their services. On April 12, 2011, the CRTC approved the companies' merger into SiriusXM Canada. John Bitove's Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the licensee of XM Canada, gained a 30% share in the new company as its primary and controlling shareholder, while Slaight Communications and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the current owners of Sirius Canada, each retained 20% ownership. Sirius XM's American parent company would hold 25%. The merger was completed on June 21, 2011.\n\nXM and Sirius use different compression and conditional access systems, making their receivers incompatible with each other's service. A condition of the merger was that Sirius XM would bring to the market satellite radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year. The interoperable radio, called the MiRGE, was made available beginning in March 2009. but the receiver was soon discontinued after both services eliminated duplicate channels which obviated the need for this radio. , Sirius XM offers radios for home, office, automotive, marine, and aviation use.\n\nSiriusXM Marine is graphical weather and fishing info for boaters. The service works with most major marine-electronics hardware companies, such as Raymarine, Furuno, Simrad and Garmin. The Marine Offshore package includes graphical weather radar; cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning; high-resolution coastal and offshore wave heights, direction and intervals; high-resolution sea-surface temperatures; pressure isobars; buoy data, etc.\n\nSiriusXM Aviation provides satellite-based graphical weather info for pilots, which provides better signal coverage and faster data refresh rate than land-based ADS-B service. Detailed info can be found in SiriusXM Aviation Weather vs ADS-B(FIS-B weather) page. The 2020 FAA Mandate does not require pilots to equip with ADS‑B/FIS‑B weather. \n\nSiriusXM Aviation receiver Model # SXAR1 and Garmin GDL51/GDL52 enables pilots to use an iPad or iPhone with the Foreflight Mobile App, via Bluetooth, to view the SiriusXM Aviation in-flight weather and data delivered via satellite to monitor storm fronts, track lightning strikes, TAFs, METARs, winds and more. \n\n, there are five satellites in orbit: two XM and two Sirius satellites and one spare. XM-3 and XM-4 are the active satellites for the XM service and replaced the original XM-1 and XM-2 satellites which were placed into a disposal orbit. Sirius FM-5 and FM-6 function as the primaries for the Sirius side. FM-6 which was launched on October 25, 2013 and declared ready for service on December 2, 2013 initially served as an in orbit spare while the company worked to deploy repeaters for the Sirius side which were needed to transition to full geostationary operation. In 2016 FM-6 was put into active service and officially replaced Sirius originals FM1-4 which operated in elliptical orbit. FM1-3 were later placed into disposal orbits. With this change FM-5 and FM-6 exclusively serve the Sirius service mirroring XM-3 and 4. Before FM-6 was launched, XM-5 was sent into orbit by Proton from Kazakhstan, on October 14, 2010, and is capable of broadcasting to either service. XM-5 serves as the in orbit spare for the entire system and can function in place of either a Sirius or XM satellite. In late 2016 Sirius XM placed an order for two new satellites SXM-7 and SXM-8 which will replace XM-3 and XM-4. These are scheduled for launch in 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n\nSirius satellites broadcast within the S band frequencies from 2.3200–2.3325 GHz, while XM radio uses adjacent frequencies 2.3325–2.3450 GHz.\n\nThe following milestones have been set during and after the merger:\n\n"}

During the Second World War it monitored propaganda broadcasts coming from mainland (German-occupied) Europe, serving the same role as the USA's Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service.\n\nIn the mid-1950s engineers at the station were involved with the first trans-Atlantic television broadcasts by the BBC. In 1957 the station was one of only two UK sites to pick up broadcasts from early Soviet rocket launches. In July 1958 it picked up radio signals from the American Explorer 4, launched by a Jupiter-C rocket.\n\nOn the Ordnance Survey maps it was listed as a \"WT Sta\" or Wireless Station. It was off the B269, north-east of the roundabout with the B2024, to the east of Pitchers Wood, around one mile north of the M25.\n\nIt listened in to short-wave transmissions, but to largely establish the frequencies of these broadcasts only. It calibrated interference from transmitters from mainland Europe, such as the Mühlacker radio transmitter in Germany which broadcast on 833 kHz, so interfering with the London Regional station on 842 kHz in 1931. On Sunday 14 January 1934 at 11pm, new radio frequencies came into operation in the Lucerne Plan undertaken by the International Broadcasting Union.\n\nIt monitored overseas BBC broadcasts to see which were being jammed, mainly by the Soviet Union, who also jammed the Voice of America. There are two types of radio jamming - skywave and groundwave, and the station could monitor skywave jamming.\n\nIn 1959 it carried out work into interference of television broadcasts in Northern Ireland and north-east Scotland. From 1960 it began to pick up unauthorised broadcasts from new pirate radio stations.\n\n\n"}

This decree sought to eliminate discrimination between citizens of different ethnicities and religions. Amongst other things, it gave Christians the right to construct places of worship by requiring them to submit a request to the Sultan.\n\nAfter Egypt gained its independence, the Hamayouni Decree was modified in 1934 by the Deputy Minister of the Interior, Al-Ezabi Pacha in the Al-Ezabi Decree. This comprised a set of 10 conditions which had to be met before any application was\npresented to the President for approval. These vague criteria include taking into account objections from local Muslims, the distance between the proposed church and the nearest mosque, the number of Christians in the area and whether or not the\nproposed church is near the Nile, public utility or railway. Human rights monitors have stated that the conditions of the decree are in contradiction with the 1971 constitution. The Al-Ezabi \"amplification\" has, in reality, served to hinder Christians and other religious minorities from maintaining and building places of worship.\n\nRegarding repairs to church property, progress has been made over the past few years following considerable national and international criticism of the decree. In January 1998, an amendment was made which delegated presidential authority to issue permits for church renovation to the country’s 26 provincial governors. On , President Mubarak decreed that church repairs no longer required a presidential, governor's or federal ministry permit. Instead, the repair of all places of worship was to be subject to a 1976 civil construction code, symbolically placing the repair of mosques and churches on equal footing before the law.\n\n"}
