It was founded in 2004 by the British activist Alexander McLean, who is currently the director.\n\nIn 2004, Alexander McLean was volunteering at the Mulago hospital in Kampala, Uganda. He worked with a group of prisoners from Luzira Upper Prison. McLean observed that prison inmates were chained to their beds, with no opportunity for sanitation and no proper medical care. Despite of being terminally ill, many patients were left unsupervised. \n\nMcLean visited the prison during his stay. He purchased materials to renovate the prison's infirmary, and with the support of the prison authorities, supervised the prisoners while they were renovating their own infirmary. One of the questions McLean posed to the inmates was about their needs, he observed an expressed desire for education. \n\nMcLean returned to the UK where he fundraised and collected books to provide health care facilities to prisons in Uganda and for the establishment of a library at Luzira Upper Prison, to bring education about the law to prison inmates. This event marked the beginning of APP. Today, McLean is a member of the Tearfund Inspired Individuals Programme, along with Kelvin Mwikya.\n\nAPP is a growing UK charity and registered NGO in East Africa, with permanent bases in Kampala and Nairobi, the APP community consists of local full-time staff members and a small group of permanent volunteers in the UK. There are a number of projects that APP is leading on, as part of the recently launched 2017 - 2020 strategy. A key priority area of work is establishing the world’s first prison-based law college and law firm, in addition to launching the Okimanyi Project in Kenya. \n\nAs APP continues to evolve and offer basic health and education services, the organization will continue to focus on access to justice and creating robust programmatic structures which will be handed over to Ugandan Prisons Service (UPS) as a legacy project.\n\nWhile working in the condemned section of Luzira Maximum Security Proson, McLean observed that groups of condemned prisoners, male and female, had formed choirs to sing at Sunday services, but had also been singing anti-death penalty songs. McLean mentioned to the British volunteer Martyn Ryan, that he would like to record these songs. \n\nMartyn Ryan and his son Ben Ryan gathered up a group of volunteers in the UK and the team headed to Uganda in December 2007. They spent several days in the prison, recording songs by three separate choirs. Upon return to the UK, the volunteers mixed and produced an album, \"Freedom Cry\". APP used the album to raise awareness of the ongoing constitutional challenge against Uganda's death penalty.\n\nAPP and McLean have won several high-profile awards.\n\n\n"}

Its capital was Ganzak. \"Atropatene\" also was the nominal ancestor of the name \"Azerbaijan\".\n\nFollowing the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, the Macedonian's conquests were divided amongst the diadochi at the Partition of Babylon. The former Achaemenid satrapy of Media was divided into two states: The greater (southern) part – \"Media Magna\" was assigned to Peithon, one of Alexander's bodyguards. The smaller (northern) region, which had been the sub-satrapy of Matiene, became \"Media Atropatene\" under Atropates, the former Achaemenid governor of all Media, who had by then become father-in-law of Perdiccas, regent of Alexander's designated successor.\n\nShortly thereafter, Atropates refused to pay allegiance to Seleucus, and made Media Atropatene an independent kingdom. It subsequently lost the \"Media\" prefix in the name and came to be known simply as \"Atropatene\". \nThe dynasty Atropates founded would rule the kingdom for several centuries, first independently, then as vassals of the Arsacids (who called it 'Aturpatakan'). It was eventually annexed by the Arsacids, who then lost it to the Sassanids, who again called it 'Aturpatakan'. At some time between 639 and 643 the Arabs under the Rashidun took control of the area during the reign of Umar. Atropatene formed a separate province of the early Islamic caliphate and was considered to have had strategic importance. It was during the Arab period that Middle Iranian (i.e. Parthian and Middle Persian) \"Aturpatakan\" became \"Adarbaygan\", \"Adarbayjan\" or \"Azerbaijan\".\n\nAlthough the below list is incomplete, they are the known ruling Kings of Media Atropatene.\n\n"}

There were a number of overlapping claims to territories and spheres of influence between the major European powers such as the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the German Empire and, to a lesser degree, the Ottoman Empire, the United Kingdom and Kingdom of Italy. \n\nIn addition to the imperialistic ambitions and interests in this region, there was a growth in nationalism with the indigenous peoples of this region leading to the formation of the independent states of Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania.\n\nWithin these nations there were movements to create \"greater\" nations, that is to enlarge the boundaries of the state beyond those areas where the national ethnic group was in the majority (\"irredentism\"). This led to conflict between the newly independent nations and the empire from which they split, the Ottoman Empire. Additionally, it led to differences between the Balkan nations who wished to gain territory at the expense of their neighbours. Both the conflict with the Ottoman Empire and between the Balkan nations led to the Balkan Wars in 1912–13. \n\nIn a different vein, the ideology of Pan-Slavism in Balkans gained popularity; the movement built around it in the region sought to unite all of the Slavs of the Balkans into one nation, Yugoslavia. This, however, would require the union of several Balkan states and territory which was part of Austria-Hungary. For this reason, Pan-Slavism was strongly opposed by Austria-Hungary, while it was supported by Russia which viewed itself as leader of all Slavic nations.\n\nTo complicate matters, in the years preceding World War I, there existed a tangle of Great Power alliances, both formal and informal, public and secret. Following the Napoleonic Wars there had existed a \"balance of power\" to, in theory, prevent major wars. This theory held that opposing combinations of powers in Europe would be evenly matched entailing that any general war would be far too costly for any nation to risk entering. This system began to fall apart as the Ottoman Empire which had been seen as a check on Russian power began to crumble, and as Germany, which had been a loose confederation of minor states, was united into a major power. Not only did these changes lead to a realignment of power, but of interests as well.\n\nAll these factors, and many others, conspired to bring about the First World War. As is insinuated by the name \"the powder keg of Europe,\" the Balkans were not the major issue at stake in the war, but were merely the catalyst that led to the conflagration. The Chancellor of Germany in the late 19th century, Otto von Bismarck, correctly predicted it would be the source of major conflict in Europe.\n\nThe powder keg \"exploded\" causing the First World War, which began with a conflict between imperial Austria-Hungary and Pan-Slavic Serbia. Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, a member of the Austrian royal family, was assassinated by a Bosnian of Serb extraction, a member of the Young Bosnia movement. Austria-Hungary then issued an ultimatum to Serbia intended to provoke it to war through extreme demands. The Serbian government reservedly accepted all of the conditions of the ultimatum, except for condition number six which demanded the inclusion of Austria-Hungary in Serbia's judicial inquiry into the assassination. \n\nSerbia indicated this would be unconstitutional and a violation of its sovereignty, and Austria-Hungary used it as a casus belli to invade Serbia. With Germany fully supporting them, the Austro-Hungarians partially mobilized their army against Serbia, which had already begun mobilizing before replying to the Austro-Hungarian July Ultimatum. Russia then began mobilizing in support of Serbia, though not bound by treaty to do so. Due to the system of European alliances, this led to a series of escalating Austrian and Russian mobilizations and eventually Britain and France were also obliged to mobilize and declare war.\n\n"}
{"id": "46349888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46349888", "title": "Public diplomacy of South Korea", "text": "Public diplomacy of South Korea\n\nThe term public diplomacy was first coined and used by Edmund Gullion in 1965 and the concept developed gradually. More recently, the definition of public diplomacy differs according to different authors. Taehwan Kim in his article \"Paradigm Shift in Diplomacy: A Conceptual Model for Korea's \"New Public Diplomacy\"\" defines it as \"a diplomatic practice or field of academic research which includes non-conventional actors (such as NGOs or civil societies) to promote diplomacy of the people\". As the importance of public diplomacy increases, South Korea is putting more efforts to engage in the new trend of diplomacy. Muzaffar S. Abduazimov in his article \"Public Diplomacy: Reappraising the South Korean Case through an Evolutionary Approach\" presents four evolutionary periods of South Korean public diplomacy: origins (late 1940s-late 1980s), diversification (early 1990s), polycentrism (early 2000s), and institutionalization (2011–present).\n\nDiverse realms of public diplomacy exist within South Korea including knowledge diplomacy, cultural diplomacy, Korean studies diplomacy, corporate diplomacy and sports and tourism diplomacy.\nKnowledge diplomacy is a sub-category of public diplomacy which utilizes a nation's successful policies, institutions, and values, accumulated and formulated through its own historical development, as soft power assets. As information becomes the most important asset for people in the 21st century, there exists a race to acquire more information which is dispersed in massive quantity with diverse methods. Under the given circumstances, it is imperative to note that abundant information is likely to contribute to miscommunication and misunderstanding which can further lead to potential conflicts. Thus, disseminating correct information and knowledge through communication is essential. When South Korea attempts to practice knowledge diplomacy, its dissemination of Korean Values should not conflict with the universal values.\n\nThe creators of \"Hallyu\" or the Korean Wave attempt to create it so that people from other countries will like it is by focusing on the commonalities between Korea and other countries.  The thought process behind that technique of packaging is the fact that the Koreans feel if people from other countries see them as similar people they are more likely to have a positive opinion of Korea and Korean culture/pop culture; Kuwahara calls this technique of focusing on similarities \"psychic distance\".  Another goal of looking the psychic distance is the attempt to make the products more easily marketable.  The Koreans want to get rid of any obstacle or tentativeness that people from other countries may have about Korea and they see the use of \"Hallyu\" as a way to accomplish that goal.  The Korean government also had the goal of affecting other countries through these uses of their pop culture.\n\nKuwahara indicates that Korea used \"soft power\" to impact other countries; soft power simply means anything except military used to influence other countries.  Due to the fact that Korea can not truly compete against other countries like the United States and China with very large and powerful militaries, this use of soft power through promotion of the Korean pop culture is a viable option for them in terms of their relationships with other countries.  Age and newness also play roles in the effect that this technique has on other countries in the eyes of the Koreans. Additionally, Hallyu \"has enlarged the circle of [South Korean] public diplomacy actors, structurally transforming it from solely state-led activity into polycentric framework of public and private partnership\", leading it to polycentrism period.\n\nThe South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs is initiating a new approach to expand its public diplomatic practices. There is a separate section in the website of South Korean MOFA on public diplomacy to provide information on what public diplomacy is, on the historical background and on the initiatives being taken. Moreover, there exists a public diplomacy portal under the MOFA which will enable more people to engage in the development of South Korea's public diplomacy.\n\nOne of the prominent obstacles is that \"cultural diplomacy is largely dominated by cultural contents, which the government tends to rely on the private sector to produce\". The limited source of investment is problematic in that the private industry is relatively volatile to changes in circumstances such as the economic situation in the market or changes in the corporation's own situations. Furthermore, the Korean Wave \"may push South Korea into a narrow trap of cultural diplomacy\" blocking the enhancement of other public diplomatic sectors. This problem is rooted in the fact that the public sector is reluctant to initiate a policy to establish a concrete plan on public diplomacy but rather rely on the already existing contents in the private market, and thus, \"it is hard to expect that ideas based on its current strategy could develop into actual policies\".\n\nTo investigate deeper in the public sector's lack of leadership considering public diplomacy, it can be found that South Korea's government lacks a consistent conception or concrete strategy for public diplomacy that will enable South Korea to reinforce its stance in soft power. The current situation is that there is an absence of systematic co-operation among the major organizations relevant to public diplomacy or even the organizations itself to deal with public diplomacy effectively which makes the decision making process and the policy implementation to be inefficient. The situation even exacerbates when there exists ministerial jurisdictional rivalry over public diplomacy because several ministries try to expand their rights over popular sectors such as the Korean Wave and this leads to the overlapping jurisdiction over the same sector. The seriousness of this situation can be explained by Taehwan Kim's analysis: \"There are one presidential council, three ministries and at least twenty-four public organizations pursuing public diplomacy and wanting to lead the policies and activities of public diplomacy\". \n The government is in an advantageous position to strengthen its cultural influence in varying regions in that the influence is not limited to certain economic restraints that the private sector faces and that the influence can be in different shapes depending on the cultural or other features of a certain nation. For example, the private sector faces limits when they aim to impress the Western society and the African society at the same time with their limited business items. However, the government can initiate a public diplomatic plan which will respectively handle different regions in the world. When the government is only concentrated in attempting to gain benefits from the cultural diplomacy founded by the private sector rather than creating a plan on their own, the systematic growth of public diplomacy becomes a more difficult task.\n\nThe lack of systematic co-operation between the government and the public hinders the firm founding of public diplomacy and the application in the society as a whole. Because of this, the most important aspect in public diplomacy which is a communication channel between the government and the public to facilitate public diplomacy with mutual assistance is lacking. Joseph Nye categorizes the three dimensions of public diplomacy that, he claims, \"help a nation accomplish its goals through diplomatic activities: daily communication; strategic communication; and the sustainable relationship among individuals through academic activities, exchanges, training, seminars and diverse media channels\". These activities that the public needs to work on to create a content that will boost the public diplomacy is not available unless the government takes the initiative to form a systematic ground to lay the cornerstone for discussion and expand the participation in realms of public diplomacy which are not being dealt with to the fullest extent until now.\n\n"}

The HD package launched with a one-year minimum subscription duration.\n\nThe launch line-up consisted of Sky1 HD, Sky Arts HD, Sky Movies 9 HD, Sky Movies 10 HD, Sky Sports HD, Discovery HD, National Geographic Channel HD, Sky Box Office HD 1 and Sky Box Office HD 2 (now Sky Movies Box Office).\n\nIn January 2010, customers started being offered the Sky+ HD box as standard, with the HD package being optional at the same subscription price. The Sky+ box was subsequently withdrawn, meaning the Sky+ HD became part of a standard installation. As of late 2013, the £10.25/month HD pack stopped being offered to new customers, instead suggesting customers subscribe to the Family package, then carrying a £5/month premium over the cost of the regular Variety package. Access to HD versions of Sky Sports and Sky Movies requires a separate HD pack subscription, priced at £5.25 per month.\n\nSky+ recording facilities are included as part of a standard Sky TV subscription package, yet entails a fee of £10.25/month if a customer does not subscribe to any Sky TV package. Viewers who do not take a subscription Sky TV package or the Sky+ service will still receive all free SD and HD channels, but cannot use the recording facilities. Uptakers of the subscription-free Freesat from Sky service are provided with a recorder-less box branded 'SkyHD' rather than Sky+ HD, given SkyHD boxes provided by Freesat from Sky do not contain hardware for recording.\n\nAs of November 2016, Sky offered over 50 HD channels, more than any competitor. Numerous FTA HD channels are available which do not require a subscription, only an HD capable digibox such as the Sky+ HD box, including BBC One HD, BBC Two HD and Channel 4 HD.\n\nOn 27 March 2007, Sky launched its \"Sky Anytime on TV\" Push-Video on Demand service for owners of Sky+ HD set top boxes. Programmes in high definition and standard definition are recorded overnight to a reserved 140GB of disk space, to give the effect of video on demand.\n\nThis has also been used to bring viewers high-definition programmes from channels that at the time didn't broadcast in HD. These have included Sky News (\"Technofile\", \"Diana: The Last Word\"), Disney Channel (\"High School Musical 2\") and Nickelodeon (\"iCarly\").\n\nThe first generation of Sky+ HD Digibox were produced by Thomson, with Sky subsequently adding Samsung, Pace and Amstrad as manufacturers afterwards. In 2009, a manufacturing fault led to a batch of up to 90,000 units manufactured by Pace requiring replacement; Sky offered customers 3 months free HD pack subscription for the inconvenience.\n\nFor connectivity with HD ready televisions, the box outputs via a HDMI connector (adapters to Digital Visual Interface are available). The box is High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) compliant. Sky boxes manufactured prior to January 2008 also had analogue component connections (YPbPr), but as the HDCP copy protection cannot be applied to this type of output it is no longer included. Traditional standard-definition (SD) connections are available via SCART and S-Video. All programming is currently output from both HDMI and SD connections, although individual broadcasters have the option to require HDCP (and therefore HDMI) in the future.\n\nAll HD channels are broadcast in 1080i format (though the box can be set to scale this to 720p if the user wishes), using the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC compression standard, from Astra 2A, Astra 2E, Astra 2F and Eutelsat 28A satellites at 28.2°E and 28.5°E in a new DVB transmission standard, DVB-S2. BBC HD was initially broadcast using DVB-S but switched to DVB-S2 on 6 June 2011.\n\nThe Version 5 EPG (electronic program guide) is almost identical to the one found on Sky+, with the exception being that by pressing \"TV Guide\" and then number 2 on the remote control, listings for only the HD channels are shown. An update was sent to the HD boxes early on 20 March 2007, which also included code for Sky Anytime (now OnDemand).\nVersion 8 of the Sky Guide, dubbed the Sky+ HD guide, included a Mini TV, improved search functions and a refreshed interface. \nOn 1 October 2010, Sky began the process of downloading open-source software to Sky+ HD receivers. Unlike the majority of software upgrades made by Sky, the open source licences require Sky to notify customers that the download has taken place. Subscribers are notified with an on-screen message that refers them to a dedicated section of the Sky website. The website also includes a download of the open source components including the building environment. Sky says that it has found a number of Open Source Software developments that provide capabilities that benefit the software used in the Sky+ HD box.\n\nBelow is a list of boxes that have been manufactured for use with Sky+ HD. All boxes are now discontinued and no newer models are expected, since the launch of Sky Q.\n\nSky also manufactured a standard Sky HD box without a hard drive, aimed primarily at customers subscribing to Sky Multiroom, as a cheaper alternative to receive HD channels if record and playback were not required.\n\nIn over three years since launch, the number of HD channels available has increased significantly, thus Sky+ HD is the world's largest HD offering outside North America.\n\nSky brought an update to its Sky+ app, this features a similar looking design to the Sky+HD box bringing the services more in line with one another.\n\nOn 30 July 2009, Sky confirmed the launch of a \"pull\" video-on-demand (VOD) service for 2010, adding to the current Sky Anytime \"push\" VOD service. The service, delivered by broadband internet, will utilise the Ethernet port of existing Sky+ HD boxes. Sky's Anytime+ will only be available to Sky broadband at launch but sky say it will be on all service providers in the near future. Although the service may be similar to DirecTV's VOD offering that also uses an operating system built by NDS Group. NDS Group was formally a Permira/News Corporation company, but currently part of Cisco. Sky have started the phased roll-out of the new guide software for this service.\n\nOn 29 April 2010, BSkyB revealed that their new video-on-demand service would be named Sky Anytime+. \"It will be a broad offering at launch with a large range of content across the range of content that we show,\" CEO Jeremy Darroch said. \"[It will feature] progressive download using the broadband return pathway and the hard disc in a combined way. All of the boxes are VOD-ready, so we'll be able to roll it out to all of the box population.\" Sky Anytime+ began a staggered roll out from 26 October 2010. In March 2011 it was confirmed by Sky that the Thomson Sky HD boxes would not be suitable for the new Anytime+ service. Customers with Thomson boxes are being offered New boxes.\n\nOn 1 February 2011, BSkyB introduced a new EPG for Sky HD subscribers which switched the standard definition channels with the high definition simulcast. For example, Sky News HD, which was on channel 517, switched to channel 501. The same happened for other non-regional HD channels, including Syfy, Comedy Central, Sky Sports, E4 and Sky1.\n\nFollowing demonstrations in December 2008, Sky announced on 30 July 2009 its intention to launch a 3D channel during 2010, featuring a broad selection of 3D programming, which is expected to include movies, entertainment and sport. Existing Sky+ HD receivers will automatically be compatible with the new 3D service, although customers will require a new 3D compatible HDTV set to view in 3D. A 3D trailer has been in circulation in UK cinemas for the new service.\nIt is thought that it will use the new MVC video codec. The first programme that was broadcast by Sky in 3D was the Arsenal vs Manchester United football match on Sunday 31 January 2010. The 3D match was available in nine hand-picked pubs in England and in Ireland. On Monday 29 March 2010, Sky 3D appeared on the EPG at number 217, showing \"Programs Start on Saturday\". Sky launched its 3D services on 3 April with the Manchester United vs Chelsea football match being broadcast in over a thousand pubs across England in 3D. As of October 2014 Sky 3D is on channel 170.\nFrom 9 June 2015 customers wanting to access Sky's 3D content will only be able to do so via its on-demand channels. To this end, there will be a new 3D segment in the Sky Box Sets, Movies, Store and TV Guide sections.\n\n\n"}
