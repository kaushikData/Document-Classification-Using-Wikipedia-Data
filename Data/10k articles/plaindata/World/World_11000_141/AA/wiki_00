It extends across most of South and Southeast Asia and into the southern parts of East Asia.\n\nAlso called the Oriental realm by biogeographers, Indomalaya extends from Afghanistan through the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia to lowland southern China, and through Indonesia as far as Java, Bali, and Borneo, east of which lies the Wallace line, the realm boundary named after Alfred Russel Wallace which separates Indomalayan from Australasia. Indomalaya also includes the Philippines, lowland Taiwan, and Japan's Ryukyu Islands.\n\nMost of Indomalaya was originally covered by forest, mostly tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, with tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests predominant in much of India and parts of Southeast Asia. The tropical moist forests of Indomalaya are mostly dominated by trees of the dipterocarp family (Dipterocarpaceae).\n\nThe World Wildlife Fund (WWF) divides Indomalayan realm into three bioregions, which it defines as \"geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)\".\n\nThe Indian Subcontinent bioregion covers most of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. The Hindu Kush, Karakoram, Himalaya, and Patkai ranges bound the bioregion on the northwest, north, and northeast; these ranges were formed by the collision of the northward-drifting Indian subcontinent with Asia beginning 45 million years ago. The Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalaya are a major biogeographic boundary between the subtropical and tropical flora and fauna of the Indian subcontinent and the temperate-climate Palearctic realm.\n\nThe Indochina bioregion includes most of mainland Southeast Asia, including Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, as well as the subtropical forests of southern China.\n\nMalesia is a botanical province which straddles the boundary between Indomalaya and Australasia. It includes the Malay Peninsula and the western Indonesian islands (known as Sundaland), the Philippines, the eastern Indonesian islands, and New Guinea. While the Malesia has much in common botanically, the portions east and west of the Wallace Line differ greatly in land animal species; Sundaland shares its fauna with mainland Asia, while terrestrial fauna on the islands east of the Wallace line are derived at least in part from species of Australian origin, such as marsupial mammals and ratite birds.\n\nThe flora of Indomalaya blends elements from the ancient supercontinents of Laurasia and Gondwana. Gondwanian elements were first introduced by India, which detached from Gondwana approximately 90 MYA, carrying its Gondwana-derived flora and fauna northward, which included cichlid fish and the flowering plant families Crypteroniaceae and possibly Dipterocarpaceae. India collided with Asia 30-45 MYA, and exchanged species. Later, as Australia-New Guinea drifted north, the collision of the Australian and Asian plates pushed up the islands of Wallacea, which were separated from one another by narrow straits, allowing a botanic exchange between Indomalaya and Australasia. Asian rainforest flora, including the dipterocarps, island-hopped across Wallacea to New Guinea, and several Gondwanian plant families, including podocarps and araucarias, moved westward from Australia-New Guinea into western Malesia and Southeast Asia.\n\nTwo orders of mammals, the colugos (Dermoptera) and treeshrews (Scandentia), are endemic to the realm, as are families Craseonycteridae (Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat), Diatomyidae, Platacanthomyidae, Tarsiidae (tarsiers) and Hylobatidae (gibbons). Large mammals characteristic of Indomalaya include the leopard, tigers, water buffalos, Asian Elephant, Indian Rhinoceros, Javan Rhinoceros, Malayan Tapir, orangutans, and gibbons.\n\nIndomalaya has three endemic bird families, the Irenidae (fairy bluebirds), Megalaimidae and Rhabdornithidae (Philippine creepers). Also characteristic are pheasants, pittas, Old World babblers, and flowerpeckers.\n\nMore information is available under .\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20925168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20925168", "title": "Monarchy of Thailand", "text": "Monarchy of Thailand\n\nThe monarchy of Thailand (whose monarch is referred to as the King of Thailand or historically as the King of Siam; refers to the constitutional monarchy and monarch of the Kingdom of Thailand (formerly Siam). The King of Thailand is the head of state and head of the ruling Royal House of Chakri.\n\nAlthough the current Chakri Dynasty was created in 1782, the existence of the institution of monarchy in Thailand is traditionally considered to have its roots from the founding of the Sukhothai Kingdom in 1238, with a brief interregnum from the death of Ekkathat to the accession of Taksin in the 18th century. The institution was transformed into a constitutional monarchy in 1932 after the bloodless Siamese Revolution of 1932. The monarchy's official ceremonial residence is the Grand Palace in Bangkok, while the private residence has been at the Dusit Palace.\n\nThe King of Thailand's titles include Head of State, Head of the Royal Thai Armed Forces, Adherent of Buddhism and Upholder of religions.\n\nThe current concept of Thai kingship evolved through 800 years of absolute rule. The first king of a unified Thailand was the founder of the Kingdom of Sukhothai, King Sri Indraditya, in 1238. The idea of this early kingship is said to be based on two concepts derived from Hinduism and Theravada Buddhist beliefs. The first concept is based on the Vedic-Hindu caste of \"Kshatriya\" (, or warrior-ruler, in which the king derives his powers from military might. The second is based on the Theravada Buddhist concept of \"Dhammaraja\" (, Buddhism having been introduced to Thailand around the 6th century CE. The idea of the Dhammaraja (or kingship under Dharma), is that the king should rule his people in accordance with Dharma and the teachings of the Buddha.\n\nThese ideas were briefly replaced in 1279, when King Ramkhamhaeng came to the throne. Ramkhamhaeng departed from tradition and created instead a concept of \"paternal rule\" (, in which the king governs his people as a father would govern his children. This idea is reinforced in the title and name of the king, as he is still known today, \"Pho Khun Ramkhamhaeng\" ( meaning 'Father Ruler Ramkhamhaeng'. This lasted briefly. By the end of the kingdom, the two old concepts returned as symbolized by the change in the style of the kings: \"Pho\" was changed to \"Phaya\" or Lord.\n\nThe Kingdom of Sukhothai was supplanted by the Kingdom of Ayutthaya, which was founded in 1351 by King Ramathibodhi I. During the Ayutthayan period, the idea of kingship changed. Due to ancient Khmer tradition in the region, the Hindu concept of kingship was applied to the status of the leader. Brahmins took charge in the royal coronation. The king was treated as a reincarnation of Hindu gods. Ayutthaya historical documents show the official titles of the kings in great variation: Indra, Shiva and Vishnu, or Rama. Seemingly, Rama was the most popular, as in \"Ramathibodhi\". However, Buddhist influence was also evident, as many times the king's title and \"unofficial\" name \"Dhammaraja\", an abbreviation of the Buddhist Dharmaraja. The two former concepts were re-established, with a third, older concept taking hold. This concept was called \"Devaraja\" ( (or \"divine king\"), which was an idea borrowed by the Khmer Empire from the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Java, especially the idea of a scholar class based on Hindu Brahmins. The concept centered on the idea that the king was an incarnation (avatar) of the god Vishnu and that he was a Bodhisattva (enlightened one), therefore basing his power on his religious power, his moral power, and his purity of blood.\n\nThe king, portrayed by state interests as a semi-divine figure, then became—through a rigid cultural implementation—an object of worship and veneration to his people. From then on the monarchy was largely removed from the people and continued under a system of absolute rule. Living in palaces designed after Mount Meru (\"home of the gods\" in Hinduism), the kings turned themselves into a \"Chakravartin\", where the king became an absolute and universal lord of his realm. Kings demanded that the universe be envisioned as revolving around them, and expressed their powers through elaborate rituals and ceremonies. For four centuries these kings ruled Ayutthaya, presiding over some of the greatest period of cultural, economic, and military growth in Thai History.\n\nThe Kings of Ayutthaya created many institutions to support their rule. Whereas feudalism developed in the European Middle Ages, Ayutthayan King Trailokanat instituted \"sakdina\", a system of social hierarchy which ranked the king's subjects according to the amount of land they were entitled to, according to their rank and position.\n\n\"Rachasap\" is required by court etiquette as an honorific register consisting of a special vocabulary used exclusively for addressing the king, or for talking about royalty.\n\nThe king was chief administrator, chief legislator, and chief judge, with all laws, orders, verdict and punishments theoretically originating from his person. The king's sovereignty was reflected in the titles \"Lord of the Land\" ( \"Phra Chao Phaen Din\") and \"Lord of Life\" ( \"Chao Chiwit\"). The king's powers and titles were seen by foreign observers as proof that the king was an absolute monarch in the European sense. However, in Siamese tradition the duty and responsibility of the king was seen as developed from the ancient Indian theories of royal authority, which resemble Enlightened Absolutism, although the emphasis is not on rationality but on Dhamma. This was disrupted in 1767, when Thai digests of the dhammasāt () were lost when a Burmese army under the Alaungpaya Dynasty invaded, sacked and burned the city of Ayutthaya.\n\nAn interlude filled by civil war was ended when King Taksin restored the dominion under what has been called the Thonburi Kingdom.\n\nIn 1782, King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke ascended the throne and moved the capital from the Thonburi side to the Bangkok side of the Chao Phraya River. There he established the House of Chakri, the current ruling dynasty of Thailand. (This first reign was later designated as that of Rama I in the list of Rama Kings of Thailand.) He also established the office of Supreme Patriarch as the head of the Sangha, the order of Buddhist monks.\n\nDuring the Rattanakosin Period the Chakri kings tried to continue the concepts of Ayutthayan kingship once again emphasizing the connection between the sovereign and his subjects. On the other hand, they continued to not relinquish any authority of the throne. Kings Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (Rama II) and Nangklao (Rama III) created a semblance of a modern administration by creating a supreme council and appointing chief officers to help with the running of the government.\n\nMongkut (Rama IV) marked a significant break in tradition when he spent the first 27 years of his adult life as a Buddhist monk during which time he became proficient in the English language, before ascending the throne. As king, he continued the appointment of officers to his supreme council, the most notable being Somdet Chao Phraya Prayurawongse and Si Suriyawongse, both of whom acted as Chief Ministers for King Mongkut (and the latter as regent, from the king's death in 1868 until 1873.)\n\nChulalongkorn (Rama V) ascended the throne as a minor at age 15 in 1868, and as King of Siam on 16 November 1873. As a prince, he had been tutored in Western traditions by the governess, Anna Leonowens. Intent on reforming the monarchy along Western lines, during his minority he traveled extensively to observe western administrative methods. He transformed the monarchy along Western lines of an \"enlightened ruler\". He abolished the practice of prostration in front of the monarch, and repealed many laws concerning the relationship between the monarch and his people, while continuing many of the ancient aspects and rituals of the old kingship. In 1874, he created a privy council copied from the European tradition, to help him rule his Kingdom. During his reign Siam was pressured to relinquish control of its old tributaries of Laos and northern Malaya to Western powers, Siam itself narrowly avoided being colonized. In 1905, 37 years after his coronation, Chulalongkorn ended slavery with the Slave Abolition Act. In 1867 slaves accounted for one-third of the Siamese population.\n\nHis son, Vajiravudh (Rama VI), ascended to the throne in 1910 and continued his father's zeal for reform to bring the monarchy into the 20th century. The perceived slow pace of reform resulted in the Palace Revolt of 1912. In 1914, Vajiravudh determined that the act providing for invoking martial law, first promulgated by his father in 1907, was not consistent with modern laws of war, nor convenient for the preservation of the security of the state, so it was amended to a more modern form that, with minor amendments, continued in force through subsequent changes in government.\n\nPrajadhipok (Rama VII) succeeded his brother in 1925. The Eton and Sandhurst educated monarch created a council similar to a cabinet, where the most important government officials could meet to decide state affairs. This advisory and legislative council, styled the Supreme Council of State of Siam (Thai: อภิรัฐมนตรีสภา) was founded on 28 November 1925 and existed until 1932.\n\nIn June 1932, a group of foreign-educated students and military men called \"the promoters\" carried out a bloodless revolution, seized power and demanded that King Prajadhipok grant the people of Siam a constitution. The king agreed and in December 1932 the people were granted a constitution, ending 150 years of absolute Chakri rule. From then on the role of the monarch was relegated to that of a symbolic head of state. His powers from then on were exercised by a prime minister and the national assembly.\n\nIn 1935 King Pradhipok (Rama VII) abdicated the throne, following disagreements with the government. He lived in exile in the United Kingdom until his death in 1941. The king was replaced by his young nephew Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII). The new king was 10 years old and was living abroad in Switzerland. A council of regents was appointed in his place. During this period the roles and powers of the king were entirely usurped by the fascist government of Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who changed the name of the kingdom from Siam to Thailand, and aligned it on the side of the Axis powers in the Pacific theatre of World War II. By the end of the war Phibunsongkhram was removed and the young king returned. The Free Thai movement provided resistance to foreign occupation during the war and helped rehabilitate Thailand after the war.\n\nAfter Rama VIII's sudden death from a bullet wound in 1946, Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), aged 19 years old, became the new monarch. In establishing his rule, the king was aided by the efforts of the US government, who used the monarchy as a bulwark against communist gains in Southeast Asia. \n\nKing Bhumibol was the world's longest reigning monarch at the time of his death in October 2016. He died on 13 October 2016 at the age of 88.\n\nSince c. 2000, the role of the Thai monarchy has been increasingly challenged by scholars, media, observers and traditionalists, and as more educated pro-democracy interests began to express their speech. Many deemed that a series of laws and measures relating to lèse majesté in Thailand are hindrances to freedom of expression. Dozens of arrests, hundreds of criminal investigations and multiple imprisonments have been made based on these laws. King Bhumibol Adulyadej's speech in his 2005 national birthday broadcast could be interpreted that he welcomed criticism.\n\nThe lèse-majesté law is part of Thailand’s Criminal Code and has been described as \"world's harshest lèse majesté law\" and \"possibly the strictest criminal-defamation law anywhere\". Political scientist Giles Ungpakorn noted that \"the \"lèse-majesté\" laws are not really designed to protect the institution of the monarchy. In the past, the laws have been used to protect governments and to shield military coups from lawful criticism. This whole [royal] image is created to bolster a conservative elite well beyond the walls of the palace.\"\n\nThe king is assisted in his work and duties by the Private Secretary to the King of Thailand and the Privy Council of Thailand, in consultation with the head of the cabinet, the Prime Minister. In accordance with the constitution the king is no longer the originator of all laws in the kingdom; that prerogative is entrusted to the National Assembly of Thailand. All bills passed by the legislature, however, require his royal assent to become law. The monarchy's household and finances are managed by the Bureau of the Royal Household and the Crown Property Bureau respectively, these agencies are not considered part of the Thai government and all personnel are appointed by the king.\n\nThe junta which took power in 2014 has been aggressive in jailing critics of the monarchy. In 2015, it spent US$540 million, more than the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on a promotional campaign called \"Worship, protect and uphold the monarchy.\" The campaign includes television commercials, seminars in schools and prisons, singing contests, and competitions to write stories and films praising the king. \"This is not propaganda,\" Prayut Chan-o-cha, the leader of the junta, said. \"The youth must be educated on what the king has done.\"\n\nIn its fiscal year 2016 budget, the ruling military government has increased its expenditure for \"upholding, protecting and preserving the monarchy\" to 18 billion baht (US$514 million), an increase of 28 percent for this budget line item since 2014 when it took power.\n\nThe present set of royal regalia of Thailand (Khrueang Raja Kakudhabhand, and the royal utensils was created mostly during the reign of King Rama I and Rama IV, after the previous set was lost during the sack of Ayutthaya by the Burmese in 1767. The regalia is used mainly during the coronation ceremony of the king at the beginning of every reign. The regalia is presently on display in the Museum of the Grand Palace in Bangkok.\n\n\nThe Thai royal utensils (Phra Khattiya Rajuprapoke; พระขัตติยราชูปโภค) are also for the personal use of the monarch, comprising:\n\n\nThese unique objects are always placed on either side of the king's throne or his seat during royal ceremonies.\n\n\nThe and other members of his family carry out many royal ceremonies per year, some dating from the 13th century.\n\n\nking is sovereign of several Royal Orders and Decorations, the prerogative to appoint and remove any persons from these orders are at the king's discretion. However, sometimes recommendations are made by the Cabinet of Thailand and the Prime Minister. There are twelve Royal Orders and some of these have separate classes.\n\n\n\n"}

He said he used to uphold financial markets as bearers of the truth but now acknowledges that it is a world where rationality is intertwined with emotions. In an interview, he stated that certain entities are needed to correct market forces. Because of the global financial crisis, the need to correct the market is greater today than before.

For the 1993 Contest the EBU decided to hold a one-off countest to select three countries to join the 22 countries already competing in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nThe independently recognised countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, took part at the Kvalifikacija za Millstreet which was held at the RTV SLO Broadcasting Centre in Ljubljana, Slovenia on 3 April 1993. Slovakia performed 7th in the running order, following Slovenia. Elán received 50 points for their song and performance, placing 4th, thereby failing to qualify.\n\n"}

She is known for being involved in a 1989 experiment on circadian rhythms, in which she voluntarily isolated herself for four months in an underground room thirty feet down a cave in Carlsbad, New Mexico, away from all outside indications of night and day. The experiment lasted from January 13, 1989, till May 22, 1989. In total, Follini spent some 130 days in the cave, thus breaking the women's world record for longest cave isolation.\n\nHailing from Ancona, Italy, Follini worked as an interior decorator. Out of 20 candidates, Follini was chosen for the experiment because she possessed an \"introspective nature\" and \"mental discipline\". At that time, she was 27 years old.\n\nThe scientific experiment commenced on January 13, 1989. It was organised by Pioneer Frontier Explorations and NASA. It took place in the \"Lost Cave\" in New Mexico. Inside her twenty by twelve foot acrylic glass room, away from all cues to the normal 24-hour daily cycle, her biological clock drifted away from its regular rhythm to following first a 28-hour day, and later on a 48-hour one. She started staying awake for up to more than twenty hours and sleeping up to ten hours at a time. Her only companions were her guitar, a computer, two \"friendly mice\" named Giuseppe and Nicoletta, a few frogs, and grasshoppers. During the course of the experiment, she was reported to have felt gloomy, with no human to cheer her up. Her only mode of communication was via the computer terminals. To curb her boredom, Follini would decorate the cave with cutouts made from cardboard.\n\nWith her slowed-down daily cycle, her meals were more spread out and she lost in weight. Follini was most of the time fed beans and rice, which partially resulted in her losing Vitamin D. She reported that at one point her menstrual cycle had stopped. She regularly did judo to maintain her strength and flexibility. When she finally emerged from the cave at the experiment's end in May 22, 1989, and was asked to guess the date, she estimated that it was March 14 or 15 —only two months from the start of the experiment instead of the four that had actually transpired. She was described as \"looking pale and thin\" after coming out from the cave. Having spent about 130 days in the cave, she broke the world record for women for the most number of days spent in isolation in a cave.\n\n"}

It originally aired on November 4, 1960 on CBS.\n\nThe story is told in a flashback by an American named David Ellington. While on a walking trip through post–World War I Europe (circa 1925), Ellington becomes lost in a storm. He sees a building, and walks towards it. It turns out to be a castle, which is now the home of an order of Brothers (Wolfring Castle, referred to in the episode as the \"Hermitage\") near the village of Schwarzwald. He knocks, the door opens, and he pleads for help. He is told by the monk who opens the door that they cannot give him shelter and that he must leave immediately. Ellington pleads for sanctuary from the storm, and, while waiting in the front hall to see if he can stay there, hears a disturbing wolf-like howl coming from somewhere in the castle. He meets Brother Jerome, who asks his purpose. After he explains, Brother Jerome regretfully announces that they cannot help him. Ellington reluctantly turns to leave, but only gets as far as the doorway before collapsing. When he awakens, he is inside the castle. \n\nUpon waking inside the castle, Ellington hears the howling again and investigates. He finds a bedraggled man in a cell. The man claims to be a prisoner of an insane religious order, locked up because he kissed his sweetheart in public, and beaten by Jerome using the staff he carries.\n\nEllington is seen talking to the prisoner and is taken to the leader of the order, Brother Jerome. When Brother Jerome refuses to explain the man in the cell, Ellington says he will leave, but also threatens to go to the police and tell them about the man in the cell. Brother Jerome, realizing that Ellington's threat might set the prisoner free, then reveals the truth: that the prisoner is not a man, but rather the Devil himself, and can only be controlled by the \"Staff of Truth\", which Jerome has. He had come to the village shortly after World War I to corrupt it, but Jerome had recognized him for what he was and used the staff to imprison him. His actions have given the world five years of relative peace, with only the evils created by mankind itself. Now convinced that Jerome is insane, Ellington pretends to believe the incredible story. Jerome is not fooled, however, and assigns another brother to watch him.\n\nEllington waits until his guard falls asleep, then creeps down to the cell. Seeing that the door is held shut only by a staff that is within reach of the imprisoned man, Ellington briefly wonders why he has not simply removed it himself. At the man's urging, Ellington removes the staff. The prisoner exits the cell—and pins Ellington to the floor with a wave of his hand from across the hall. As he walks toward the exit, he begins to change, taking on more and more of the appearance of the Devil with each step, before departing the castle in a plume of smoke. Jerome arrives, realizes what has happened, and sadly explains that the inability to recognize the devil has always been Man's great weakness.\n\nThe flashback ends. Ellington has been telling the story to a maid. He says that ever since then he has been hunting for the devil to atone for his mistake, through World War II, the Korean War, and the development of nuclear weapons. He has finally succeeded; he has him locked in a closet barred by a similarly shaped staff, and he intends to return him to the castle and Brother Jerome's keeping. He warns the skeptical housekeeper not to remove the staff under any circumstances while he goes to make his final preparations. As soon as Ellington leaves, the maid hears a howl from behind the door and in her curiosity removes the staff, allowing the door to slowly open.\n\n\nThis was the first aired episode of the second season that was not written by Rod Serling.\n\nCharles Beaumont had originally envisioned that the monks would keep the Devil imprisoned by putting a cross in front of his cell door. Fearful of a backlash in the religious community, the producers substituted the \"staff of truth\" over Beaumont's objections.\n\n\n\n"}
