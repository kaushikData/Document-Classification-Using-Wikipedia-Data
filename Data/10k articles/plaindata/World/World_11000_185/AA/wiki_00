It is located in the coastal Djibouti Region on the Gulf of Tadjoura.\n\nDjibouti City has a population of around 529,000 inhabitants, which counts for over 70% of the country's population. The settlement was founded in 1888 by the French, on land leased from the ruling Somali and Afar Sultans. During the ensuing period, it served as the capital of French Somaliland and its successor the French Territory of the Afars and Issas.\n\nKnown as the \"Pearl of the Gulf of Tadjoura\" due to its location, Djibouti City is strategically positioned near the world's busiest shipping lanes and acts as a refueling and transshipment center. The Port of Djibouti is the principal maritime port for imports to and exports from neighboring Ethiopia. Additionally, the city is the headquarters of many international organizations , non-profit organizations and companies. Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport is the main domestic airport, connecting the capital to various major global destinations. Djibouti City has the second-largest economy of any city in the Horn of Africa after Addis Ababa.\n\nFrom 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the Gulf of Tadjoura was called \"Obock\". It was ruled by Somali and Afar Sultans, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region.\n\nThe French subsequently founded Djibouti City in 1888, in a previously uninhabited stretch of coast. In 1896, the settlement was made the capital of French Somaliland. The city later grew considerably in size following the construction of the Imperial Ethiopian Railway. \n\nIt at the time had a population of 15,000 residents, exceeding the population of all cities in neighbouring Ethiopia except Harar. Although the initial company failed and required a government bailout to avoid falling under British administration, the Franco-Ethiopian Railway itself was a success and allowed Djibouti city's commerce to quickly eclipse the former caravan-based trade carried on with nearby Zeila in British Somaliland. Djibouti became the center of exports from southern Ethiopia and the Ogaden, including trade in Harari coffee and khat.\nWhen Germany invaded France in 1940, Djibouti fell under the control of the Axis-allied Vichy French. In response, the United Kingdom closed the port, but it could not prevent local French from providing information on the passing ship convoys. In December 1942, about 4,000 British troops occupied the town. Djibouti city had about 22,046 residents. The population of the City Of Djibouti was growing rapidly, from officially about 17,000 inhabitants in 1947 to 40,000 in early 1960, 62,000 in 1967, 118,000 in 1972 to over 150,000 in the early 1980s. It then became the headquarters of the succeeding French Territory of the Afars and Issas.\n\nSince independence in 1977, the city has served as the administrative and commercial capital of the Republic of Djibouti.\n\nDjibouti City is a multi-ethnic town. It has a population of around 529,000 residents (Djiboutians), making it by far the largest settlement in the country. The two largest ethnic groups are the Somali and the Afars, who are traditionally attached to the Hamitic anthropological group. The city's urban landscape is shaped by many communities. The ethnic make-up of Djibouti City changed in 1990s, when significant numbers of Ethiopians and Somali immigrants arrived in the city, with Djibouti City nicknamed the \"French Hong Kong in the Red Sea\" due to its cosmopolitan urbanism.\n\nThe majority of local residents speak Somali (303,100 speakers) or Afar (101,200 speakers) as a first language, which are the mother tongues of the Somali and Afar ethnic groups, respectively. Both languages belong to the larger Afroasiatic family. There are two official languages in Djibouti: Arabic (Afroasiatic) and French (Indo-European).\n\nArabic is of social, cultural and religious importance. In formal settings, it consists of Modern Standard Arabic. Colloquially, about 40,000 local residents speak the Ta'izzi-Adeni Arabic dialect, also known as \"Djibouti Arabic\". French was inherited from the colonial period and is the primary language of instruction. About 14,200 Djiboutians speak it as a first language. Immigrant languages include Omani Arabic (38,900 speakers), Amharic (1,400 speakers), Greek (1,000 speakers) and Hindi (600 speakers).\n\nDjibouti's population is predominantly Muslim. Islam is observed by 94% of the nation's population (around 740,000 ), whereas the remaining 6% of residents are Christian adherents. The Diocese of Djibouti serves the small local Catholic population, which it estimates numbered around 7,000 individuals in 2006.\n\nDjibouti City is the capital and largest settlement in Djibouti, situated in the Horn of Africa. The city is located in eastern Djibouti, approximately northwest of the Somalia border. It is a seaport, with the only sheltered harbour on the western side of the Gulf of Tadjoura. The landscape around the city, along with Djibouti's coastal lowlands, is desert or semi-desert. The city's sandy beaches include Siesta Beach and Heron Beach. It is known as the \"Pearl of the Gulf of Tadjoura\" due to its location.\n\nDjibouti City has an arid climate (Köppen: \"BWh\"). It is characterised by very hot rainless summers and a very warm, less dry winter season. Most of the annual precipitation falls between October and May. The city sees on average of rainfall per year. Average high temperatures range from during the months of December, January and February, to about in July. There are two seasons: a hot dry season from May to October and a cooler season with more precipitation from November to April (winter). The rainfall on the coast usually occurs between November to March, whereas further inland it falls between April to October. In the summer months, temperatures routinely exceed , with relative humidity at its lowest point of the year. Sunshine is abundant in the city, averaging eight to ten hours a day year-round. It is lowest during the rainy period, when there is some coastal fog and greater cloud coverage as warm air passes over the cool sea surface. However, precipitation is highly variable and long periods without any rainfall occur throughout the year. Unusual episodes of heavy rain sometimes occur, with a maximal falling in November 1949.\n\nThis climate zone has summers that reach a maximum temperature of and a minimum temperature of . Winters have average nighttime temperatures of and a daytime maximum temperatures of .

The old section is filled with bazaars and souks nestled along narrow streets. It is serves as both a center for commerce and entertainment, as well as a residential area. To accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being constructed in and around the city. A few of the building fronts have been renovated and date back to the 19th century. The Place Menelik in the city center is also distinguished by its Moorish-inspired arches. Due to its numerous exotic edifices and structures, the city has also been likened to a European settlement.\n\nDjibouti City has the distinction of being both a city and an administrative province. The Djibouti Region is one of the six regions of Djibouti. It borders the Gulf of Tadjoura to the north and east, and the Arta Region to the south and west. The Djibouti Region is the smallest province in the country, but also the region with the highest population. Containing Djibouti's capital, Djibouti City, the province occupies an area of .\n\nDjibouti City has been the capital of Djibouti since independence in 1977. Due to its maritime location, it was the logical choice as the young republic's administrative center. Following independence, Djibouti City continued with its status as the country's political and cultural hub. It is the seat of the government and home to all the national institutions: the government house, the parliament, ministries, the presidential palace, the vice-presidential residence, the constitutional court, judicial bodies and other public organizations.\n\nDjibouti City also serves as a hub for various state agencies, as well as continental and international organizations. The Social Development Agency of Djibouti (Agence de Développement Sociale de Djibouti) has its head offices here, as does the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) trade bloc. Additionally, the Regional Somali Language Academy, a language regulator established in June 2013 by the governments of Djibouti, Somalia and Ethiopia, has its headquarters in the city.\n\nDjibouti City is also home to the Armoured Regiment of Djibouti. The French 5th Overseas Interarms Regiment has served as the Djibouti garrison since 1 November 1969.\n\nThe Djibouti National Police, founded in 1977 in the locality of Djibouti City, has law enforcement jurisdiction over the area.\n\nDjibouti City has numerous hotels in all categories, from luxury to basic, as well as many restaurants offering Djiboutian specialities and other foods.

The Djiboutian attire is typical of several countries in the Horn of Africa.\n\nDjibouti City has long been a center of media in the country. The first forms of public film display in the city and Djibouti at large were newsreels of key events during the early colonial period. The Djibouti City-based Radio Television of Djibouti is the principal national public service broadcaster. RTD airs 24 hours a day, and can be viewed both within Djibouti and abroad via terrestrial and satellite platforms. Several newspapers, magazines and printing facilities have their offices in the capital.

The Muslim festivals of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha also feature prominently in the city's cultural observances, events and celebrations. Additional local, national and international events are held here throughout the year.\n\nAs in the rest of Djibouti, football is by far the most popular sport, basketball is also a second popular sport in the city. The city is home to Stade du Ville, which plays host to the Djibouti Cup and to football teams from the Djibouti Premier League. Djibouti City has established a high-profile reputation as a host city of international sporting events. At the beginning of the 20th century, a number of sporting institutions were established in the city, particularly in school and college settings.\n\nForeign visitors to Djibouti City usually like to frequent the shops on Bender Road (Rue de Bender), where myriad things ranging from traditional fabrics and leather products can be found at bargain prices. The newly built Casino Supermarket (Casino Supermarché) is the capital's largest such shopping center. For fresh produce, meat, clothing, and other goods and services, the open Ryad Market (Marché de Ryad) is a commercial outlet of choice.\n\nThe Hamoudi Mosque was constructed in 1906 by Haji Hamoudi. It is among the older standing masjids in the capital. Its size and prominent location have made it a local landmark. The Saoudi Mosque (Mosquée Saoudi) on Boulevard Bounhour is another of the city's main masjids.\n\nThe presidential palace is the official residence and principal workplace of the President of Djibouti. It overlooks the Gulf of Tadjoura, with access to both the harbour and airport.\n\nDjibouti City has several public parks.

Djibouti City is the financial hub to many entrepreneurial industries ranging from construction, retail, import and export, money transfer companies, and Internet cafés.\n\nCargo operations at the Port of Djibouti are the chief economic activity of Djibouti. The city's port is the terminus for Ethiopian oil transport and export. Increase in railway infrastructure has further enabled Ethiopian and Eritrean oil products to reach the capital.\n\nTourism in Djibouti is centered in the Djibouti region. City landmarks include historic buildings, two important public squares, and the Hall of the People. Many private companies offer organized tours of these sites. Known as the \"Pearl of the Gulf of Tadjoura\", the city's sandy beaches are also popular tourist attractions.\n\nKhor Ambado lies on the outskirts of Djibouti city, around from the city center. A popular local attraction, this beach has a number of restaurant establishments overlooking the sea. Doraleh is another beach situated about from the capital, on a paved road that winds through the dunes of volcanic rocks. With its main restaurant, Doraleh is a favorite hangout on Fridays leading up to the weekend. Other prominent beaches in the city include Siesta Beach and Heron Beach.\n\nThe two small Maskali and Moucha islands are situated an hour's drive from Djibouti City. They feature madreporic mangroves, with a rich seabed and colorful algae. Various fish species can also be found in the local coral gardens, including groupers, jacks and barracuda. \n\nAnother notable city landmark is La Place du 27 Juin, a street named after Djibouti's independence day.

The main bus hub in Djibouti City is the Central Bus Station, located at the crossing of Rue de Bender.\n\nDjibouti City is served primarily by the Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport. It is the second largest airport in the Horn of Africa, and offers flights to numerous global destinations. , the largest services using the airport include Air Djibouti, Yemenia, Air France, Flydubai, Ethiopian Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Kenya Airways and Qatar Airways. It is the largest airport in Djibouti and serves as a major gateway for travellers to the Horn of Africa and the world. Located approximately from the city centre, the airport was opened in 1948. Originally a modest-sized facility, the airport grew considerably in size in the post-independence period after numerous successive renovation projects. Outbound international travel from the Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport accounts for the majority of all air passengers traveling to and from Djibouti. Due to its strategic location, the facility acts as a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This makes for a large number of departures and arrivals, and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing.\n\nThe Port of Djibouti is one of the largest and busiest seaports in the Horn region. , the container terminal at the port handles the bulk of the nation's trade. About 70% of the seaport's activity consists of imports to and exports from neighboring Ethiopia, which depends on the harbour as its main maritime outlet. The port also serves as an international refueling center and transshipment hub. In 2012, the Djiboutian government in collaboration with DP World started construction on the Doraleh Container Terminal, a third major seaport intended to further develop the national transit capacity. A $396 million project, it has the capacity to accommodate 1.5 million twenty foot container units annually.\n\nDjibouti city is a terminus of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. For most of its length, the railway runs parallel to the abandoned metre-gauge Ethio-Djibouti Railway. However, the standard-gauge railway is built on a new, straighter right-of-way that allows for much higher speeds. New stations have been built outside city centres, and the old stations have been decommissioned. On 10 January 2017, the 100 km section of Djibouti side was inaugurated in a ceremony held in the new station by Djibouti's President Ismail Omar Guelleh and Ethiopia’s prime minister Hailemariam Dessalegn. There are two local railway stations: a passenger station at Nagad, and a freight station at the Port of Doraleh.\n\nDjibouti City is the largest and most important educational center in the nation. It is home to many elementary and high schools, religious schools, and other institutions of learning.

United States Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, Jr. was chairperson of the U.S. delegation, and realized that a temporary design might become the permanent symbol of the United Nations. He formed a committee headed by Oliver Lundquist that developed a design consisting of a world map surrounded by leaves from a design created by Donal McLaughlin.\n\nThe blue that appears in the background of the insignia was chosen to be \"the opposite of red, the war colour\", although the exact shade has never been officially specified by the United Nations. The original colour the group chose in 1945 was a gray blue that differs from the current United Nations flag. The globe used in the original design was an azimuthal projection focused on the North Pole with the United States, the host nation of the conference, at the centre. The projection that was used cut off portions of the Southern Hemisphere at the latitude of Argentina, which was acceptable at the time, as Argentina was not planned to be an original member of the United Nations. The projection was later altered so that no country will be at prominence within the flag. The new logo was now designed so that the globe is bisected in the centre by the Prime Meridian and the International Date Line.\n\nIn 1946, a UNO committee got the task of making a definite design, which was presented December 2, 1946, and adopted by the plenary session of the UNO on December 7, 1946. The earlier version had the globe 90 degrees turned eastward compared with the present flag, which has the Prime Meridian and the International Date Line forming the vertical diameter. According to press statements, the change was made to move North America away from the centre of the emblem.\n\nAccording to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, the emblem and the flag of the United Nations can be used by the personnel and material of UN peacekeeping missions as a protective sign to prevent attacks during an armed conflict.\n\nThe United Nations flag may also be flown as a garrison flag with other country flags.

{"id": "45728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45728", "title": "Hamburger", "text": "Hamburger\n\nA hamburger, beefburger or burger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, bacon, onion, pickles, or chiles; condiments such as mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, or \"special sauce\"; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.\n\nThe term \"burger\" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the UK where the term \"patty\" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. The term may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in \"turkey burger\", \"bison burger\", or \"veggie burger\".\n\nHamburgers are sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants (where burgers may sell for several times the cost of a fast-food burger, but may be one of the cheaper options on the menu). There are many international and regional variations of the hamburger.\n\nThe term \"hamburger\" originally derives from Hamburg, Germany's second-largest city. In German, \"Burg\" means \"castle\", \"fortified settlement\" or \"fortified refuge\" and is a widespread component of place names. The first element of the name is perhaps from Old High German \"hamma\", referring to a bend in a river, or Middle High German \"hamme\", referring to an enclosed area of pastureland. \"Hamburger\" in German is the demonym of Hamburg, similar to \"frankfurter\" and \"wiener\", names for other meat-based foods and demonyms of the cities of Frankfurt and Vienna (Wien), respectively.\n\nThe term \"burger\", a back-formation, is associated with many different types of sandwiches, similar to a (ground meat) hamburger, but made of different meats such as buffalo in the buffalo burger, venison, kangaroo, turkey, elk, lamb or fish like salmon in the salmon burger, but even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the veggie burger.\n\nThere have been many claims about the origin of the hamburger, but the origins remain unclear. The popular book \"The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy\" by Hannah Glasse included a recipe in 1758 as \"Hamburgh sausage\", which suggested to serve it \"roasted with toasted bread under it\". A similar snack was also popular in Hamburg by the name \"Rundstück warm\" (\"bread roll warm\") in 1869 or earlier, and supposedly eaten by many emigrants on their way to America, but may have contained roasted beefsteak rather than Frikadeller. Hamburg steak is reported to have been served between two pieces of bread on the Hamburg America Line, which began operations in 1847. Each of these may mark the invention of the Hamburger, and explain the name.\n\nThere is a reference to a \"Hamburg steak\" as early as 1884 in the Boston Journal. On July 5, 1896, the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" made a highly specific claim regarding a \"hamburger sandwich\" in an article about a \"Sandwich Car\": \"A distinguished favorite, only five cents, is Hamburger steak sandwich, the meat for which is kept ready in small patties and 'cooked while you wait' on the gasoline range.\"\n\nAccording to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, the hamburger, a ground meat patty between two slices of bread, was first created in America in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, owner of Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut. There have been rival claims by Charlie Nagreen, Frank and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, and Fletcher Davis. White Castle traces the origin of the hamburger to Hamburg, Germany with its invention by Otto Kuase. However, it gained national recognition at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair when the \"New York Tribune\" referred to the hamburger as \"the innovation of a food vendor on the pike\". No conclusive argument has ever ended the dispute over invention. An article from ABC News sums up: \"One problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the spread of the burger happened largely at the World's Fair, from tiny vendors that came and went in an instant. And it is entirely possible that more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different parts of the country.\"\n\nLouis Lassen of Louis' Lunch, a small lunch wagon in New Haven, Connecticut, is said to have sold the first hamburger and steak sandwich in the U.S. in 1900. \"New York\" magazine states that \"The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named the meat on a bun after themselves years later\", noting also that this claim is subject to dispute. A customer ordered a quick hot meal and Louis was out of steaks. Taking ground beef trimmings, Louis made a patty and grilled it, putting it between two slices of toast. Some critics like Josh Ozersky, a food editor for \"New York Magazine\", claim that this sandwich was not a hamburger because the bread was toasted.\n\nOne of the earliest claims comes from Charlie Nagreen, who in 1885 sold a meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair now sometimes called the Outagamie County Fair. The Seymour Community Historical Society of Seymour, Wisconsin, credits Nagreen, now known as \"Hamburger Charlie\", with the invention. Nagreen was fifteen when he was reportedly selling pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair, made so customers could eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar.\n\nAccording to White Castle, Otto Kuase was the inventor of the hamburger. In 1891 he created a beef patty cooked in butter and topped with a fried egg. German sailors would later omit the fried egg.\n\nThe family of Oscar Weber Bilby claim the first-known hamburger on a bun was served on July 4, 1891 on Grandpa Oscar's farm. The bun was a yeast bun. In 1995, Governor Frank Keating proclaimed that the first true hamburger on a bun was created and consumed in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1891, calling Tulsa, \"The Real Birthplace of the Hamburger.\"\n\nFrank and Charles Menches claim to have sold a ground beef sandwich at the Erie County Fair in 1885 in Hamburg, New York. During the fair, they ran out of pork sausage for their sandwiches and substituted beef. Kunzog, who spoke to Frank Menches, says they exhausted their supply of sausage, so purchased chopped up beef from a butcher, Andrew Klein. Historian Joseph Streamer wrote that the meat was from Stein's market not Klein's, despite Stein's having sold the market in 1874. The story notes that the name of the hamburger comes from Hamburg, New York not Hamburg Germany. Frank Menches's obituary in \"The New York Times\" states that these events took place at the 1892 Summit County Fair in Akron, Ohio.\n\nFletcher Davis of Athens, Texas claimed to have invented the hamburger. According to oral histories, in the 1880s he opened a lunch counter in Athens and served a 'burger' of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread, with a pickle on the side. The story is that in 1904, Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a sandwich stand at the St. Louis World's Fair. Historian Frank X. Tolbert, noted that Athens resident Clint Murchison said his grandfather dated the hamburger to the 1880s with 'Old Dave' a.k.a. Fletcher Davis. A photo of \"Old Dave's Hamburger Stand\" from 1904 was sent to Tolbert as evidence of the claim.\n\nVarious non-specific claims of invention relate to the term \"hamburger steak\" without mention of its being a sandwich. The first printed American menu which listed hamburger is said to be an 1834 menu from Delmonico's in New York. However, the printer of the original menu was not in business in 1834. In 1889, a menu from Walla Walla Union in Washington offered hamburger steak as a menu item.\n\nBetween 1871 and 1884, \"Hamburg Beefsteak\" was on the \"Breakfast and Supper Menu\" of the Clipper Restaurant at 311/313 Pacific Street in San Fernando, California. It cost 10 cents—the same price as mutton chops, pig's feet in batter, and stewed veal. It was not, however, on the dinner menu. Only \"Pig's Head,\" \"Calf Tongue,\" and \"Stewed Kidneys\" were listed. Another claim ties the hamburger to Summit County, New York or Ohio. Summit County, Ohio exists, but Summit County, New York does not.\n\n\nHamburgers are usually a feature of fast food restaurants. The hamburgers served in major fast food establishments are usually mass-produced in factories and frozen for delivery to the site. These hamburgers are thin and of uniform thickness, differing from the traditional American hamburger prepared in homes and conventional restaurants, which is thicker and prepared by hand from ground beef. Most American hamburgers are round, but some fast-food chains, such as Wendy's, sell square-cut hamburgers. Hamburgers in fast food restaurants are usually grilled on a flat-top, but some firms, such as Burger King, use a gas flame grilling process. At conventional American restaurants, hamburgers may be ordered \"rare\", but normally are served medium-well or well-done for food safety reasons. Fast food restaurants do not usually offer this option.\n\nThe McDonald's fast-food chain sells the Big Mac, one of the world's top selling hamburgers, with an estimated 550 million sold annually in the United States. Other major fast-food chains, including Burger King (also known as Hungry Jack's in Australia), A&W, Culver's, Whataburger, Carl's Jr./Hardee's chain, Wendy's (known for their square patties), Jack in the Box, Cook Out, Harvey's, Shake Shack, In-N-Out Burger, Five Guys, Fatburger, Vera's, Burgerville, Back Yard Burgers, Lick's Homeburger, Roy Rogers, Smashburger, and Sonic also rely heavily on hamburger sales. Fuddruckers and Red Robin are hamburger chains that specialize in the mid-tier \"restaurant-style\" variety of hamburgers.\n\nSome restaurants offer elaborate hamburgers using expensive cuts of meat and various cheeses, toppings, and sauces. One example is the Bobby's Burger Palace chain founded by well-known chef and Food Network star Bobby Flay.\n\nHamburgers are often served as a fast dinner, picnic or party food and are often cooked outdoors on barbecue grills.\nA high-quality hamburger patty is made entirely of ground (minced) beef and seasonings; these may be described as \"all-beef hamburger\" or \"all-beef patties\" to distinguish them from inexpensive hamburgers made with cost-savers like added flour, textured vegetable protein, ammonia treated defatted beef trimmings (which the company Beef Products Inc, calls \"lean finely textured beef\"), advanced meat recovery, or other fillers. In the 1930s ground liver was sometimes added. Some cooks prepare their patties with binders like eggs or breadcrumbs. Seasonings may include salt and pepper and others like as parsley, onions, soy sauce, Thousand Island dressing, onion soup mix, or Worcestershire sauce. Many name brand seasoned salt products are also used.\n\nRaw hamburger may contain harmful bacteria that can produce food-borne illness such as , due to the occasional initial improper preparation of the meat, so caution is needed during handling and cooking. Because of the potential for food-borne illness, the USDA recommends hamburgers be cooked to an internal temperature of . If cooked to this temperature, they are considered well-done.\n\nBurgers can also be made with patties made from ingredients other than beef. For example, a \"turkey burger\" uses ground turkey meat, a \"chicken burger\" uses ground chicken meat. A \"buffalo burger\" uses ground meat from a bison, and an \"ostrich burger\" is made from ground seasoned ostrich meat. A deer burger uses ground venison from deer.\n\nA \"veggie burger\", \"black bean burger\", \"garden burger\", or \"tofu burger\" uses a meat analogue, a meat substitute such as tofu, TVP, seitan (wheat gluten), quorn, beans, grains or an assortment of vegetables, ground up and mashed into patties.\n\nA steak burger is marketing term for a hamburger claimed to be of superior quality. or, in Australia, a sandwich containing a steak.\n\nSteak burgers are first mentioned in the 1920s. Like other hamburgers, they may be prepared with various accompaniments and toppings.\n\nUse of the term \"steakburger\" dates to the 1920s in the United States. In the U.S. in 1934, A.H. \"Gus\" Belt, the founder of Steak 'n Shake, devised a higher-quality hamburger and offered it as a \"steakburger\" to customers at the company's first location in Normal, Illinois. This burger used a combination of ground meat from the strip portion of T-bone steak and sirloin steak in its preparation. Steak burgers are a primary menu item at Steak 'n Shake restaurants, and the company's registered trademarks included \"original steakburger\" and \"famous for steakburgers\". Steak 'n Shake's \"Prime Steakburgers\" are now made of choice grade brisket and chuck.\n\nBeef is typical, although other meats such as lamb and pork may also be used. The meat is ground or chopped.\n\nIn Australia, a steak burger is a steak sandwich which contains a whole steak, not ground meat.\n\nSteak burgers may be cooked to various degrees of doneness.\n\nSteak burgers may be served with standard hamburger toppings such as lettuce, onion, and tomato. Some may have additional various toppings such as cheese, bacon, fried egg, mushrooms, additional meats, and others.\n\nVarious fast food outlets and restaurants such as Burger King, Carl's Jr., Hardee's, IHOP, Steak 'n Shake, Mr. Steak, and Freddy's market steak burgers. Some restaurants offer high-end burgers prepared from aged beef. Additionally, many restaurants have used the term \"steak burger\" at various times.\n\nSome baseball parks concessions in the United States call their hamburgers steak burgers, such as Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nBurger King introduced the Sirloin Steak sandwich in 1979 as part of a menu expansion that in turn was part of a corporate restructuring effort for the company. It was a single oblong patty made of chopped steak served on a sub-style, sesame seed roll. Additional steak burgers that Burger King has offered are the Angus Bacon Cheddar Ranch Steak Burger, the Angus Bacon & Cheese Steak Burger, and a limited edition Stuffed Steakhouse Burger.\n\nIn 2004 Steak 'n Shake sued Burger King over the latter's use of term \"Steak Burger\" in conjunction with one of its menu items, claiming that such use infringed on trademark rights.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, burgers may be classified as two main types: fast food hamburgers and individually prepared burgers made in homes and restaurants. The latter are often prepared with a variety of toppings, including lettuce, tomato, onion, and often sliced pickles (or pickle relish). French fries often accompany the burger. Cheese (usually processed cheese slices but often Cheddar, Swiss, pepper jack, or blue), either melted directly on the meat patty or crumbled on top, is generally an option.\n\nCondiments might be added to a hamburger or may be offered separately on the side including mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, salad dressings and barbecue sauce.\n\nOther toppings can include bacon, avocado or guacamole, sliced sautéed mushrooms, cheese sauce, chili (usually without beans), fried egg, scrambled egg, feta cheese, blue cheese, salsa, pineapple, jalapeños and other kinds of chili peppers, anchovies, slices of ham or bologna, pastrami or teriyaki-seasoned beef, tartar sauce, french fries, onion rings or potato chips.\n\n\nIn Mexico, burgers (called \"hamburguesas\") are served with ham and slices of American cheese fried on top of the meat patty. The toppings include avocado, jalapeño slices, shredded lettuce, onion and tomato. The bun has mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. In certain parts are served with bacon, which can be fried or grilled along with the meat patty. A slice of pineapple is also a usual option, and the variation is known as a \"Hawaiian hamburger\".\n\nSome restaurants' burgers also have barbecue sauce, and others also replace the ground patty with sirloin, Al pastor meat, barbacoa or a fried chicken breast. Many burger chains from the United States can be found all over Mexico, including Carl's Jr., Sonic, as well as global chains such as McDonald's and Burger King.\n\nHamburgers in the UK and Ireland are very similar to those in the US, and the High Street is dominated by the same big two chains as in the U.S. — McDonald's and Burger King. The menus offered to both countries are virtually identical, although portion sizes tend to be smaller in the UK. In Ireland the food outlet Supermacs is widespread throughout the country serving burgers as part of its menu. In Ireland, Abrakebabra (started out selling kebabs) and Eddie Rocket's are also major chains.\n\nAn original and indigenous rival to the big two U.S. giants was the quintessentially British fast-food chain Wimpy, originally known as Wimpy Bar (opened 1954 at the Lyon's Corner House in Coventry Street London), which served its hamburgers on a plate with British-style chips, accompanied by cutlery and delivered to the customer's table. In the late 1970s, to compete with McDonald's, Wimpy began to open American-style counter-service restaurants and the brand disappeared from many UK high streets when those restaurants were re-branded as Burger Kings between 1989 and 1990 by the then-owner of both brands, Grand Metropolitan. A management buyout in 1990 split the brands again and now Wimpy table-service restaurants can still be found in many town centres whilst new counter-service Wimpys are now often found at motorway service stations.\n\nHamburgers are also available from mobile kiosks, commonly known as “burger vans\", particularly at outdoor events such as football matches. Burgers from this type of outlet are usually served without any form of salad — only fried onions and a choice of tomato ketchup, mustard or brown sauce.\n\nChip shops, particularly in the West Midlands and North-East of England, Scotland and Ireland, serve battered hamburgers called batter burgers. This is where the burger patty, by itself, is deep-fat-fried in batter and is usually served with chips.\n\nHamburgers and veggie burgers served with chips and salad, are standard pub grub menu items. Many pubs specialize in \"gourmet\" burgers. These are usually high quality minced steak patties, topped with items such as blue cheese, brie, avocado et cetera. Some British pubs serve burger patties made from more exotic meats including venison burgers (sometimes nicknamed Bambi Burgers), bison burgers, ostrich burgers and in some Australian themed pubs even kangaroo burgers can be purchased. These burgers are served in a similar way to the traditional hamburger but are sometimes served with a different sauce including redcurrant sauce, mint sauce and plum sauce.\n\nIn the early 21st century \"premium\" hamburger chain and independent restaurants have arisen, selling burgers produced from meat stated to be of high quality and often organic, usually served to eat on the premises rather than to take away. Chains include Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Ultimate Burger, Hamburger Union and Byron Hamburgers in London. Independent restaurants such as Meatmarket and Dirty Burger developed a style of rich, juicy burger in 2012 which is known as a \"dirty burger\" or \"third-wave burger\".\n\nIn recent years Rustlers has sold pre-cooked hamburgers reheatable in a microwave oven in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the UK, as in North America and Japan, the term \"burger\" can refer simply to the patty, be it beef, some other kind of meat, or vegetarian.\n\nFast food franchises sell American style fast food hamburgers in Australia and New Zealand. The traditional Australasian hamburgers are usually bought from fish and chip shops or milk bars. The hamburger meat is almost always ground beef, or \"mince\" as it is more commonly referred to in Australia and New Zealand. They commonly include tomato, lettuce, grilled onion and meat as minimum, and can optionally include cheese, beetroot, pineapple, a fried egg and bacon. If all these optional ingredients are included it is known in Australia as \"burger with the lot\".\nThe term 'burger' is also applied to any hot sandwich using a bun for the bread, even when the filling does not contain beef, such as a chicken burger (generally with chicken breast rather than chicken mince), salmon burger, pulled pork burger, veggie burger, etc. The term 'sandwich' is usually only applied when the bread used is sliced bread.\n\nThe only variance between the two countries' hamburgers is that New Zealand's equivalent to \"The Lot\" often contains a steak (beef) as well. The condiments regularly used are barbecue sauce and tomato sauce. The McDonald's \"McOz\" Burger is partway between American and Australian style burgers, having beetroot and tomato in an otherwise typical American burger; however, it is no longer a part of the menu. Likewise, McDonald's in New Zealand created a Kiwiburger, similar to a Quarter Pounder, but features salad, beetroot and a fried egg. The Hungry Jack's (Burger King) \"Aussie Burger\" has tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese, bacon, beetroot, egg, ketchup and a meat patty.\n\nIn China, restaurants such as McDonald's and KFC exist, which sell hamburgers.\n\nIn Japan, hamburgers can be served in a bun, called \"hanbāgā\" (ハンバーガー), or just the patties served without a bun, known as \"hanbāgu\" (ハンバーグ) or \"hamburg\", short for \"hamburg steak\".\n\n\"Hamburg steaks\" (served without buns) are similar to what are known as Salisbury steaks in the U.S. They are made from minced beef, pork or a blend of the two mixed with minced onions, egg, breadcrumbs and spices. They are served with brown sauce (or demi-glace in restaurants) with vegetable or salad sides, or occasionally in Japanese curries. Hamburgers may be served in casual, western style suburban restaurant chains known in Japan as \"family restaurants\".\n\nHamburgers in buns, on the other hand, are predominantly the domain of fast food chains such as American chains known as McDonald's and Wendy's. Japan has home grown hamburger chain restaurants such as MOS Burger, First Kitchen and Freshness Burger. Local varieties of burgers served in Japan include teriyaki burgers, \"katsu\" burgers (containing tonkatsu) and burgers containing shrimp korokke. Some of the more unusual examples include the rice burger, where the bun is made of rice, and the luxury 1000-yen (US$10) \"Takumi Burger\" (meaning \"artisan taste\"), featuring avocados, freshly grated wasabi, and other rare seasonal ingredients. In terms of the actual patty, there are burgers made with Kobe beef, butchered from cows that are fed with beer and massaged daily. McDonald's Japan also recently launched a McPork burger, made with U.S. pork. McDonald's has been gradually losing market share in Japan to these local hamburger chains, due in part to the preference of Japanese diners for fresh ingredients and more refined, \"upscale\" hamburger offerings. Burger King once retreated from Japan, but re-entered the market in Summer 2007 in cooperation with the Korean owned Japanese fast-food chain Lotteria.\n\nAccording to the Guinness World Records, a Japanese man, Takeru Kobayashi ate the most amount of hamburgers in three minutes on July 11, 2014.\n\nRice burgers, mentioned above, are also available in several East Asian countries such as Taiwan and South Korea. Lotteria is a big hamburger franchise in Japan owned by the South Korean Lotte group, with outlets also in China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan. In addition to selling beef hamburgers, they also have hamburgers made from squid, pork, tofu, and shrimp. Variations available in South Korea include Bulgogi burgers and Kimchi burgers.\n\nIn the Philippines, a wide range of major U.S. fast-food franchises are well represented, together with local imitators, often amended to the local palate. The chain McDonald's (locally nicknamed \"McDo\") have a range of burger and chicken dishes often accompanied by plain steamed rice or French fries. The Philippines boasts its own burger-chain called Jollibee, which offers burger meals and chicken, including a signature burger called \"Champ\". Jollibee now has a number of outlets in the United States, the Middle East and East Asia.\n\nIn India, burgers are usually made from chicken or vegetable patties due to cultural beliefs against eating beef (which stem from Hindu religious practice) and pork (which stems from Islamic religious practice). Because of this, the majority of fast food chains and restaurants in India do not serve beef. McDonald's in India, for instance, does not serve beef, offering the \"Maharaja Mac\" instead of the Big Mac, substituting the beef patties with chicken. Another version of the Indian vegetarian burger is the Wada Pav consisting deep-fried potato patty dipped in gramflour batter. It is usually served with mint chutney and fried green chili.\n\nIn Pakistan, apart from American fast food chains, burgers can be found in stalls near shopping areas, the best known being the \"shami burger\". This is made from \"shami kebab\", made by mixing lentil and minced lamb. Onions, scrambled egg and ketchup are the most may be toppings.\n\nIn Malaysia there are 300 McDonald's restaurants. The menu in Malaysia also includes eggs and fried chicken on top of the regular burgers. Burgers are also easily found at nearby mobile kiosks, especially Ramly Burger.\n\nIn Mongolia, a recent fast food craze due to the sudden influx of foreign influence has led to the prominence of the hamburger. Specialized fast food restaurants serving to Mongolian tastes have sprung up and seen great success.\nIn Turkey, in addition to the internationally familiar offerings, numerous localized variants of the hamburger may be found, such as the Islak Burger (lit. \"Wet-Burger\"), which a beef slider doused in seasoned tomato sauce and steamed inside a special glass chamber, and has its origins in the Turkish fast food retailer Kizilkayalar. Other variations include lamb-burgers and offal-burgers, which are offered by local fast food businesses and global chains alike, such as McDonald's and Burger King. Most burger shops have also adopted a pizzeria-like approach when it comes to home delivery, and almost all major fast food chains deliver.\n\nIn the former Yugoslavia, and originally in Serbia, there is a local version of the hamburger known as the \"pljeskavica\". It is often served as a patty, but may have a bun as well.\n\nThroughout Belgium and in some eateries in the Netherlands, a Bicky Burger is sold that combines pork, chicken, and horse meat. The hamburger, usually fried, is served between a bun, sprinkled with sesame seeds. It often comes with a specific \"Bickysaus\" (Bicky dressing) made with mayonnaise, mustard, cabbage, and onion.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a location-based service designed to allow friends or family members to share their location with each other and communicate with each other.\n\nLife360 was founded by Chris Hulls and Alex Haro and has received a total of $90 million in funding since its launch, including funding from both Facebook and Google. The app was initially released in 2008 in the Android marketplace. The first funding for Life360 came in the form of a $275,000 grant as a winner of Google's 2008 Android Developer Challenge. Additional funding included $5.5 million in a Series A round, $17 million in a Series B round, and $50 million in a Series C round.\n\nLife360 entered into an agreement with BMW in 2013 to integrate the location services of Life360 with the navigation in BMW automobiles. The same year, Life360 surpassed Foursquare in the number of registered users with 34 million and reached more than 40 million registered users the same year. Life360 also saw an increase in user registration following the announcement from Google that they would be shutting down their Google Latitude platform in August 2013.\n\nIt was announced in 2013 that Life360 would be adding global support for its app which would include support in languages other than English and international SMS. The announcement came after downloads of the Life360 app increased internationally, even though the app was only available in English.\n\nIn 2016, Life360 added a feature that enables smartphones to detect when people are in a car crash and automatically contacts emergency response. In February 2016, Life360 acquired the private messaging application and Y Combinator grad Couple based in Mountain View.\n\nAt CES in January 2018, ADT announced ADT Go in partnership with Life360. ADT Go connects and protects families outside the home, utilizing ADT's expansive security infrastructure.\n\nLife360 is both a web and mobile application and was referred to as a \"family-oriented private social network\" by Bloomberg Businessweek. The app is a social network for families and differentiates itself in this way as it is not based around peer groups or professional networks such as Find My Friends and LinkedIn. It allows users to share locations, group message, and call for roadside assistance. It has four main features which include location sharing, circles, places, and premium.\n\nThe main feature of the app is location sharing. Users can open the app and see where other members are instantly. Users can choose to share or not to share their location with any particular circle at any particular time.\n\nCircles is the app’s newest feature, released on September 3, 2013. Circles allows users to create separate groups within the app, e.g. “caregivers,” “extended family,” and “John’s baseball team.” Users’ location is only visible to those who are also in the circle, and members in “caregivers” cannot see the location of users in “extended family,” unless they are also in that circle.\n\nLife360 allows users to create geofences that alert them when another enters or leaves another location.\n\nLife360 operates as a freemium app, and users can pay for extra features. These extra features include: stolen phone insurance, access to a live advisor 24/7, unlimited creation of “Places,\" and emergency roadside assistance.\nUsers have identified some problems such as signal drop and inaccurate location reporting.\n\nLife360 has received multiple awards including funding as winner of both Google Android Developer Challenge and Facebook fbFund. It received the People's Voice Award for Best Use of GPS or Location Technology at the 2012 Webby Awards. The same year it was announced as the Gold Seal Winner at the Mom's Choice Awards and also received the Reader's Choice Award from About.com as the Coolest Parenting Teens Gadget Winner.\n\n"}

{"id": "1704859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1704859", "title": "Maravi", "text": "Maravi\n\nMaravi was a kingdom which straddled the current borders of Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia, in the 16th century. The present-day name \"Maláŵi\" is said to derive from the Chichewa word \"malaŵí\", which means \"flames\".\n\nAt its greatest extent, the state included territory from the Tonga and Tumbuka people's areas in the north to the Lower Shire in the south, and as far west as the Luangwa and Zambezi river valleys. Maravi's rulers belonged to the Mwale matriclan and held the title Kalonga. They ruled from Manthimba, the secular/administrative capital, and were the driving force behind the state's establishment. Meanwhile, the patrilineal Banda clan, which traditionally provided healers, sages and metallurgists, took care of religious affairs from their capital Mankhamba near Nthakataka. \n\nAfter contact with the Portuguese, trade intensified. It included such items as beads of the Khami type and Chinese porcelain imported via Portuguese intermediaries. In the 19th century, the state declined and the Maravi were frequently raided by their neighbours the Yao and captured for sale as slaves. David Livingstone visited Lake Nyasa in 1859, and other Protestant missionaries soon followed.\n\nThe Maravi Confederacy was founded by the Bantu people immigrating into the valley of the Shire River (flowing out of Lake Nyassa) around 1480 AD. It prospered into the late 18th century, extending to reach what is now belonging to Zambia and Mozambique. In the 19th century the neighboring Yao raided on them, selling captive Maravi on the slave markets of Kilwa and Zanzibar. In the 1860s, Islam was introduced into the region through contact with Swahili slave traders. The region was visited by David Livingstone and stations were set up by Protestant missionaries in 1873. A British consul was also sent there in 1883. \n\nBeginning as early as the thirteenth century, the first signs of a large-scale migration of related clans entered the region of Lake Malawi. Traditional accounts indicate that these people originated in the Congo Basin to the west of Lake Mweru, in an area that subsequently formed part of the Luba Kingdom. The movement continued during the succeeding two or three centuries, but it appears certain that by the sixteenth century the main body of these people, known collectively as the Maravi, were settled in the Shire River valley and over a wide area lying generally west and southwest of Lake Malawi, including parts of present-day Zambia and Mozambique. The first (colonial) historical account of the Maravi was by Gaspar Boccaro, a Portuguese man who traveled through their territory in 1616. The picture presented in the 1660s by Father Manuel Barretto, a Jesuit priest, was of a strong, economically active confederation that swept an area from the coast of Mozambique between the Zambezi River and the bay of Quelimane for several hundred miles into the mainland. An account from the following century implied that the western limits of the confederation were near the Luangwa River and that it extended on the north to the Dwangwa River. \n\n\"Maravi\" is therefore a general name of the peoples of Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique and the eastern part of Zimbabwe. The Chewa language, which is also referred to as Nyanja, Chinyanja or Chichewa, and is spoken in southern and central Malawi, in Zambia and to some extent in Mozambique, is the main language that emerged from this empire.\n"}

As with the \"krar\", this instrument is used by Ethiopian minstrels called \"azmaris\" (\"singer\" in Amharic)\n. Although it functions in a purely accompaniment capacity in songs, the masenqo requires considerable virtuosity, as azmaris accompany themselves while singing.\n\nThe square- or diamond-shaped resonator is made of four small wooden boards glued together, then covered with a stretched parchment or rawhide. The single string is typically made of horse hair, and passes over a bridge. The instrument is tuned by means of a large tuning peg to fit the range of the singer's voice.

{"id": "40691435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40691435", "title": "Mass surveillance in the United Kingdom", "text": "Mass surveillance in the United Kingdom\n\nThe use of electronic surveillance by the United Kingdom grew from the development of signal intelligence and pioneering code breaking during World War II. In the post-war period, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) was formed and participated in programmes such as the Five Eyes collaboration of English-speaking nations. This focused on intercepting electronic communications, with substantial increases in surveillance capabilities over time. A series of media reports in 2013 revealed bulk collection and surveillance capabilities, including collection and sharing collaborations between GCHQ and the United States' National Security Agency. These were commonly described as mass surveillance. Similar capabilities exist in other western European countries, such as France.\n\nSurveillance of electronic communications in the United Kingdom is controlled by laws made in the UK Parliament. In particular, access to the content of private messages (that is, interception of a communication such as an email or telephone call) must be authorised by a warrant signed by a Secretary of State. In addition European Union data privacy law applies in UK law. The law provides for governance and safeguards over the use of electronic surveillance. Further oversight including a requirement for judges to review warrants authorised by a Secretary of State, as well as new surveillance powers, were introduced by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016.\n\nThe judicial body which oversees the intelligence services in the United Kingdom, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, ruled that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, its practices do not constitute mass surveillance. Other independent reports, including one by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament, also came to this view although they found past shortcomings in oversight and disclosure, and said the legal framework should be simplified to improve transparency. However, notable civil liberties groups and broadsheet newspapers continue to express strong views to the contrary, while UK and US intelligence agencies and others have criticised these viewpoints in turn.\n\nVarious government bodies maintain databases about citizens and residents of the United Kingdom. These include \"bulk data sets\" such as medical records. In January 2016 the Home Secretary stated she would neither restrict the data sets that might be accessed for such purposes, nor state whether or not communications protected from law enforcement access such as journalist's sources and legal privilege had been accessed covertly. Although the use of video surveillance cameras in the United Kingdom is common, as it is in many countries, its prevalence may historically have been overstated . Legal provisions exist that control and restrict the collection, storage, retention, and use of information in government databases, and require local governments or police forces operating video surveillance cameras to comply with a code of conduct: the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice.\n\nThe legal framework in the United Kingdom for lawful interception and storage of communications data and, when a warrant exists, the content of electronic communications is based on the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and several other pieces of legislation. The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (DRIPA) 2014 deals with the retention of certain types of communications data (not the content of messages). It was brought into effect after the European Union's Data Retention Directive was declared invalid. The Telecommunications Act 1984 has also been used by the government to facilitate bulk communications data collection. The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 includes several provisions related to controlling or restricting the collection, storage, retention, and use of information in government databases. The Human Rights Act 1998 requires the intelligence agencies, including GCHQ, to respect citizens' rights as enumerated in the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled in December 2014 that the legal frameworks in the United Kingdom governing the bulk interception of data and intelligence sharing with agencies in other countries do not breach the European Convention on Human Rights, and are compliant with Articles 8 (right to privacy) and 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the Tribunal stated that one particular aspect of intelligence sharing, the data-sharing arrangement that allowed UK Intelligence services to request data from the US surveillance programmes Prism and Upstream, had been in contravention of human rights law until two paragraphs of additional information, providing details about the procedures and safeguards, were disclosed to the public in December 2014.\n\nPrivacy and civil liberties advocates such as Liberty and Privacy International, who brought a legal case against the government to force the judgement, continue to oppose to the temporary bulk collection of data, powers to access this and retain selected data, as well as intelligence sharing relationships; they intend to appeal the judgement to the European Court of Human Rights. Intelligence agencies and MPs have criticised the viewpoint of privacy campaigners on this issue.\n\nFollowing the publication of a special report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in March 2015, which identified shortcomings in past oversight and potential improvements to the legislative framework, Prime Minister David Cameron initiated an inquiry into the legalisation governing the interception powers of the intelligence agencies.\n\nA third independent report into surveillance in the UK published in July 2015 found the intelligence agencies are not knowingly carrying out illegal mass surveillance of British citizens. However, it did say the laws governing the agencies' powers to intercept private communications need a significant overhaul. This view is consistent with separate reports by the Interception of Communications Commissioner.\n\nIn October 2016, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled British security services had, in secret, unlawfully collected citizens' information, including financial information, individual phone and web use, and other confidential personal data, without adequate safeguards or supervision for 17 years. The tribunal found that from its inception in 1998 until its public acknowledgement in 4 November 2015, this bulk collection was in breach of article 8 of the European convention on human rights.\n\nAfter a High Court victory by two MPs challenging the legality of DRIPA, the UK government appealed to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), but in December 2016 the verdict of the national court was upheld. The ECJ ruled that general and indiscriminate retention of emails and electronic communications by governments was illegal, opening the way to challenges against the UK’s new Investigatory Powers Act (2016), which replaced DRIPA.\n\n the Investigatory Powers Bill was published for scrutiny. The bill would introduce new powers, as well as restate existing ones, for targeted interception of communications, bulk collection of communications data, and bulk interception of communications. New oversight procedures would be introduced, including a requirement for a judge to review a warrant signed by a Minister for interception of communications, that is reading the content of messages. The bill would require Internet connection records – which websites were visited but not the particular pages and not the full browsing history – to be kept by internet service providers for one year. \n\nOn November 16, 2016, the Investigatory Powers Bill had passed both houses of parliament and is scheduled to become law.\n\nThe Investigatory Powers Act 2016 is a comprehensive statute which makes provision for both targeted and bulk retention of content and metadata. It consolidates much of the previous legislation and makes public a number of previously secret powers (equipment interference, bulk retention of metadata, intelligence agency use of bulk personal datasets).\n\nControversially, it enables the Government to require internet service providers and mobile phone companies to maintain records of (but not the content of) customers' Internet connections for up to 12 months. Police and intelligence officers may seek approval for access to these records without a warrant, as part of a targeted investigation. \n\nIn addition, the Act creates new safeguards, including a requirement for judges to approve the warrants authorised by a Secretary of State before they come into force.\n\nThe Bill that gave rise to the Act was informed by reports of seven parliamentary committees, as well as an external report from the Royal United Services Institute and two influential reports by David Anderson QC, the UK's Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation: A Question of Trust (2015) and the report of his Bulk Powers Review (2016). The latter contains a detailed appraisal (with 60 case studies) of the operational case for the bulk powers used by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ and often characterised as mass surveillance.\n\nThe Act may yet require amendment as a consequence of legal cases brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nIn April 2014, the European Court of Justice ruled that the European Union's Data Retention Directive was invalid. Since October 2007, telecommunication companies had been required to keep records of phone calls and text messages for a minimum of 6 months and at most 24 months under this directive. The European Court of Justice found it violates two basic rights, respect for private life and protection of personal data.\n\nSupported by all three major political parties in the UK, Parliament passed the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act in July 2014 to ensure the police and security services retained their existing powers to access telephone and internet records. No additional powers were granted by the legislation, but it did make clear that the requirements also apply to foreign companies, based abroad, whose telephone and internet services are used in the UK.\n\nThe data being retained does not include the content of messages and telephone calls, just metadata describing when and who the users contacted by email, telephone, or text message. In circumstances when the Home Secretary issues a warrant for intercepting the content of private messages, the Act clarifies the law with which internet services providers must comply.\n\nProvisions were included in the Act to \"increase transparency and oversight\"; the BBC reported that this included the following:\n\nIn July 2015, the High Court issued an order that parts of the Act were unlawful, and to be disapplied, suspended until 31 March 2016, thereby giving the government a deadline to come up with alternative legislation which is compatible with EU law.\n\nFollowing the 2010 general election the new government stated it would take measures to \"reverse the substantial erosion of civil liberties and roll back state intrusion\".\n\nA report by the House of Lords Constitution Committee, \"Surveillance: Citizens and the State\", had warned in 2009 that increasing use of surveillance by the government and private companies was a serious threat to freedoms and constitutional rights, stating, \"The expansion in the use of surveillance represents one of the most significant changes in the life of the nation since the end of World War II. Mass surveillance has the potential to erode privacy. As privacy is an essential pre-requisite to the exercise of individual freedom, its erosion weakens the constitutional foundations on which democracy and good governance have traditionally been based in this country.\"\n\nA YouGov poll published in 2006 indicated that 79% of those interviewed agreed that Britain has become a 'surveillance society' (51% were unhappy with this). In 2004 the Information Commissioner, discussing the proposed British national identity database gave a warning of this, stating, \"My anxiety is that we don't sleepwalk into a surveillance society.\" Other databases causing him concern were the National Child Database (ContactPoint), the Office for National Statistics' Citizen Information Project (which subsequently became part of the national identity database), and the National Health Service National Programme for IT.\n\nAs part of the new measures announced by the government in 2010, the national identity database, including ContactPoint (and the Citizen Information Project), was scrapped.\n\nIn addition, the Draft Communications Data Bill, which would have extended powers, for example to include web browsing history, was abandoned by the government in 2013 after opposition from the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his party, the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 includes several provisions related to controlling or restricting the collection, storage, retention, and use of information in government databases, specifically:\n\n\nPart 2, Chapter 1 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 creates a new regulation for, and instructs the Secretary of State to prepare a code of practice regarding the use of closed-circuit television and automatic number plate recognition.\n\nThe Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIP or RIPA) is significant piece of legislation that granted and regulated the powers of public bodies to carry out surveillance and investigation. Activities covered by the Act include the interception of the content of telephone, internet, and postal communications; collection of information about, but not the content of, telephone, Internet, and postal communications (type of communication, caller and called telephone numbers, Internet addresses, domain names, postal addresses, date, time, and duration); use of agents, informants, undercover officers; electronic surveillance of private buildings and vehicles; following people; and gaining access to encrypted data.\n\nRIPA allows certain public bodies:\n\nThe powers granted by RIPA can be invoked by government officials on the grounds of national security, for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime or serious crime, preventing disorder, protecting public safety or health, in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, assessing or collecting any tax, duty, levy or other imposition, contribution or charge payable to a government department, or in an emergency, preventing or mitigating death, injury, or any damage to a person's physical or mental health. Some of the powers granted by the Act are available to a relatively short list of from 5 to 12 government bodies, while others are available to longer lists of over 40 bodies.\n\nThe 2000 Act received Royal Assent on 28 July 2000 and Commencement Orders bringing provisions within this Act into force were issued between 2002 and 2012. Where prior legislation exists, the 2000 Act works in conjunction with that legislation, in particular the Intelligence Services Act 1994, the Police Act 1997, and the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nThe Act has been amended several times, to both extend and restrict the powers granted. In 2002 the UK government announced plans to extend the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act so that at least 28 government departments would be given powers to access metadata about citizens' web, e-mail, telephone and fax records, without a warrant and without a subject's knowledge. Public and security authorities made a total of 440,000 requests to monitor people's phone and internet use in 2005–2006. In the period 11 April to 31 December 2006 the UK government issued 253,557 requests for communication data, which as defined by the RIPA includes who you phoned, when they phoned you, how long they phoned you for, subscriber information and associated addresses.\n\nRIPA and the Data Protection Act 1998 require a formal warrant before private data may be gathered by the government. Warrants authorising interception of the content of electronic communications can only be issued by a democratically elected Member of Parliament, usually the Home Secretary, or another Secretary of State. RIPA imposes constraints to ensure the activities authorised meet the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), in particular that they are necessary and proportional. The Intelligence and Security Committee reported that GCHQ applies these standards to all of its work, not just activities governed by RIPA, to act as a check over all of its activities being necessary and proportional as required by the ECHR.\n\nThe Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act established the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to provide judicial oversight and hear complaints about surveillance activities by intelligence agencies and other public bodies. The Tribunal replaced the Interception of Communications Tribunal, the Security Service Tribunal, and the Intelligence Services Tribunal on 2 October 2000. Between 2000 and 2009 the Tribunal had upheld 4 out of the 956 complaints received.\n\nThe use of the Telecommunications Act 1984 for communications data collection, and the lack of oversight of this capability, was highlighted in the April 2014 report of the Home Affairs Committee of the House of Commons on Counter-terrorism. This was reiterated in the March 2015 report of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament on Privacy and Security. Section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 allows a Secretary of State to give providers of public electronic communications networks \"directions of a general character… in the interests of national security\", which may be protected from disclosure. The Act also gives the government certain powers to block foreign involvement in the critical national infrastructure of the United Kingdom. In November 2015, it was revealed MI5 had been using the Telecommunications Act 1984 to collect phone data in bulk for a decade.\n\nA series of media reports in 2013 revealed bulk collection and surveillance capabilities involving GCHQ in the United Kingdom such as Tempora and its component programmes Mastering the Internet and Global Telecoms Exploitation. The Tempora programme involves a large-scale buffer for storing internet content for 3 days and metadata for 30 days. A number of other GCHQ operations were revealed, including hacking into telecoms equipment, access to fibre-optic cables and programmes operated jointly with the NSA.\n\nGCHQ was originally established after the First World War as the \"Government Code and Cypher School\" (GC&CS) and was known under that name until 1946. During World War II, staff including Alan Turing worked on decoding the German Enigma machine, and many other foreign systems. In 1940, GC&CS was working on the diplomatic codes and ciphers of 26 countries, tackling over 150 diplomatic cryptosystems.\n\nAfter World War II, the United Kingdom and the United States signed the bilateral UKUSA Agreement in 1948. It was later broadened to include Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as co-operation with several \"third-party\" nations. This became the cornerstone of Western intelligence gathering and the \"Special Relationship\" between the UK and the USA. ECHELON is a code name often used for this global signals intelligence collection and analysis network.\n\nGCHQ was placed on a statutory footing for the first time by the Intelligence Services Act 1994. Activities that involve interception of communications were legislated for under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000; this kind of interception can only be carried out after a warrant has been issued by a Secretary of State, usually the Home Secretary. The Human Rights Act 1998 requires the intelligence agencies, including GCHQ, respect citizens' rights as enumerated in the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe Prime Minister nominates cross-party Members of Parliament to an Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC). The remit of the Committee includes oversight of intelligence and security activities and reports are made directly to Parliament. A special report on Privacy and Security, published by the ISC in March 2015, found that although GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not conduct mass surveillance. It did identify past shortcomings in oversight and said the legal framework should be simplified to improve transparency.\n\nThe UK also has an independent Intelligence Services Commissioner and Interception of Communications Commissioner, both of whom are former senior judges. Annual reports by the Interception of Communications Commissioner have found the use of interception powers by the intelligence agencies comply with existing legislation.\n\nJudicial oversight of GCHQ's conduct is provided by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT). The IPT ruled in December 2014 that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not practice mass surveillance.\n\nThe Justice and Security Act 2013 included a range of reforms to the Intelligence and Security Committee to provide for further access and investigatory powers. \"The Telegraph\" reported that this included the following:\n\nVarious government bodies maintain databases about citizens and residents of the United Kingdom. Under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, legal provisions exist that control and restrict the collection, storage, retention, and use of information in government databases.\n\nThe British Police hold records of 5.5 million fingerprints and over 3.4 million DNA samples on the National DNA Database. There is increasing use of roadside fingerprinting, using new police powers to check identity. Concerns were raised in 2010 over the unregulated use of biometrics in schools, affecting young children. Subsequently, the government introduced legal duties on schools, if they wish to use biometric information about pupils, in the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.\n\nAcross the country efforts have been increasingly under way to track road vehicle movements, initially using a nationwide network of roadside cameras connected to automatic number plate recognition systems. These have tracked, recorded, and stored the details of journeys undertaken on major roads and through city centres. This information is stored for two years. In the future, mandatory onboard vehicle telematics systems have been suggested, to facilitate road charging (\"see vehicle excise duty\").\n\nIn London, the Oyster card payment system can track the movement of individual people through the public transport system, although an anonymous option is available. The London congestion charge uses computer imaging to track car number plates.\n\nIn February 2009 it emerged that the government was planning a database to track and store records of all international travel into and out of the UK. The database would retain record of names, addresses, telephone numbers, seat bookings, travel itineraries and credit card details, which would be kept for 'no more than 10 years'. In April 2015, passport exit checks began at UK borders and data will be stored on all travellers as they leave the UK.\n\nPolice Forward Intelligence Teams have conducted surveillance of political and environmental protestors and of journalists. The information they gathered has been stored in the crimint database.\n\nThe combination of CCTV and facial recognition could be considered a form of mass surveillance, but has not been widely used. This type of system has been trialled at airports to compare faces with biometric passports, but such an application is comparable to existing identification checks at borders.\n\nIn 2005 the City of Westminster trialled microphones fitted next to CCTV cameras. Westminster council explained that the microphones were part of an initiative to tackle urban noise and would not \"be used to snoop\", but comments from a council spokesman appeared to imply they could capture an audio stream alongside the video stream, rather than simply reporting noise levels. The trials were discontinued in 2008 with no further plans for use.\nIn 2013, the Home Office published the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice for the use of surveillance cameras, including automatic number plate recognition systems, by local and government authorities. The aim of the code is to help ensure CCTV use is \"characterised as surveillance by consent, and such consent on the part of the community must be informed consent and not assumed by a system operator. Surveillance by consent should be regarded as analogous to policing by consent.\"\n\nThe vast majority of CCTV cameras are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses. According to 2011 Freedom of Information Act requests, the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around 52,000 over the entirety of the UK.\n\nAn article published in \"CCTV Image\" magazine estimated the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom was 1.85 million in 2011. The estimate was based on extrapolating from a comprehensive survey of public and private cameras within the Cheshire Constabulary jurisdiction. This works out as an average of one camera for every 32 people in the UK, although the density of cameras varies greatly from place to place. The Cheshire report also claims that the average person on a typical day would be seen by 70 CCTV cameras.\n\nThe Cheshire figure is regarded as more dependable than a previous study by Michael McCahill and Clive Norris of \"UrbanEye\" published in 2002. Based on a small sample in Putney High Street, McCahill and Norris extrapolated the number of surveillance cameras in Greater London to be around 500,000 and the total number of cameras in the UK to be around 4,200,000. According to their estimate the UK has one camera for every 14 people. Although it has been acknowledged for several years that the methodology behind this figure is flawed, it has been widely quoted. Furthermore, the figure of 500,000 for Greater London is often confused with the figure for the police and local government operated cameras in the City of London, which was about 650 in 2011.\n\nThe \"CCTV User Group\" estimated that there were around 1.5 million private and local government CCTV cameras in city centres, stations, airports, and major retail areas in the UK. This figure does not include the smaller surveillance systems such as those that may be found in local corner shops and is therefore broadly in line with the Cheshire report.\n\nResearch conducted by the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research and based on a survey of all Scottish local authorities, identified that there were over 2,200 public space CCTV cameras in Scotland.\n\n\nOther legislation\n"}

The Pomeranians were nevertheless always able to regain their independence. In the course of the 12th century, the non-Christian Pomeranians faced continuous pressure from their expanding Christian neighbours Denmark, Poland, and the Saxon dukes of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1121 they were again subdued by the Polish duke Bolesław III Wrymouth, who had Pomerania Christianized by the German missionary Otto of Bamberg.\n\nAt the same time the Pomeranian Prince Wartislaw I conquered the former Lutici lands west of the Oder.

The Pomeranian lands were eventually divided, with the Western parts entering the Holy Roman Empire as the Duchy of Pomerania in 1181, and the Eastern part consisting of Pomerelia under the Samborides came under the influence of Poland and, from 1309 onwards, the Teutonic Order.\n\nAfter the Germanization of Pomerania resulting from the medieval Ostsiedlung, many Pomeranians were slowly and gradually assimilated and discontinued the use of their Slavic language and culture.

There were also locally produced short bulletins for members of the French garrison in Berlin.\n\nThe departure of the Allies from Berlin in 1994 signalled the end of the FFB radio service.

{"id": "42551231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42551231", "title": "Registry of World Record Size Shells", "text": "Registry of World Record Size Shells\n\nThe Registry of World Record Size Shells is a conchological work listing the largest (and in some cases smallest) verified shell specimens of various mollusc taxa. A successor to the earlier \"World Size Records\" of Robert J. L. Wagner and R. Tucker Abbott, it has been published on a semi-regular basis since 1997, changing ownership and publisher a number of times. Originally planned for release every two years, new editions are now published annually. Since 2008 the entire registry has been available online in the form of a searchable database. The registry is continuously expanded and now contains more than 22,000 listings and 85,000 supporting images.\n\nCertain families of attractive shells (such as cones, cowries, marginellas, and murex) are particularly favoured by collectors. World record size shells (commonly indicated by the acronym 'WRS') of species in the most popular families are much sought after by some shell collectors, and can thus command high prices. Collections of such shells are exhibited at a number of specialist museums, including the Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum. Maximum and minimum sizes are also of interest to malacologists, and may be useful in delimiting closely related species. As an extensive compilation of maximum shell sizes, the registry has found use as a data source for scientific studies.\n\nThroughout its history the registry has covered four classes of molluscs: bivalves, cephalopods, gastropods, and scaphopods. Chitons have been excluded because their shells are formed from eight articulated plates and therefore the size of a fixed specimen depends in large part on the preservation method used.\n\nSmallest adult sizes have been listed beginning with a few specimens of Cypraeidae and Strombidae in the first edition, and they now additionally encompass a third family: Marginellidae. Separate records for sinistral (left-handed) shells and obviously rostrate cowries (family Cypraeidae) are also included. Terrestrial and freshwater species, as well as fossils of extant taxa, are not covered by the registry.\n\nThe bulk of the publication—which apart from the cover is unillustrated—comprises a list of taxa and their corresponding world record sizes. Each specimen in the registry is listed alphabetically under its recognised scientific name. This is usually a binomen (species name), but subspecies, varieties and forms are also included (the latter two are used informally and are not regulated by the \"ICZN\"). In addition to the shell size, each specimen is listed with its location, owner or repository, and the year it was collected, acquired, or registered (whichever is known, listed in decreasing order of preference).\n\nEach print edition has an appendix with an alphabetical listing of entry totals for all private collectors and repositories having ownership of specimens in the registry. In the first edition, the most individual entries belonged to Victor Dan, with 369, closely followed by co-author Don Pisor at 325. This title subsequently went to Tennessee physician and world-renowned collector Pete Stimpson, who for a time held over 2,000 entries in the registry, and whose WRS specimens have been exhibited at museums including the McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture. The distinction of having the most WRS entries now belongs to Havelet Marine, which counted 3,244 specimens in the 2008 edition, compared to Stimpson's 1,963.\n\nThe registry's rules specify that specimens \"should be measured with vernier type calipers and should reflect the greatest measurable dimension of the shell in any direction including any processes of hard shell material produced by the animal (i.e. spines, wings, keels, siphonal canals, etc.) and not including attachments, barnacles, coralline algae, or any other encrusting organisms. Long, hair-like periostracum is not to be included.\"\n\nShell sizes are given in millimetres and recorded to the nearest , as is standard in conchology. To account for human error and environmental effects, new records are only accepted if they exceed the standing record by at least . This 0.3 mm margin also applies to smallest adult sizes exceeding .\n\nEntries for specimens that tie the standing record can also be submitted. Though not included in the registry, they are kept on file in the event that the current record holder is shown to be misidentified or smaller than originally claimed.\n\nThe three largest species in the registry are the bivalves \"Kuphus polythalamia\", \"Tridacna gigas\" and \"Pinna nobilis\", with maximum recorded shell sizes of , and , respectively. The fourth largest species, and the largest of all gastropods, is \"Syrinx aruanus\" with a maximum length of . There are literature records of an even larger \"S. aruanus\" specimen measuring , but these are erroneous and actually refer to the same specimen, which is on display at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. The extinct gastropod \"Campanile giganteum\" reached a similar size.\n\nThe largest listed cephalopod shell is that of \"Argonauta argo\", at .\n\nFor inclusion in the registry, size records must be verified either by a recognised second party (\"a professional malacologist, a reputable shell dealer, or an advanced collector who is recognized as a specialist in the applicable family\") or through photographic evidence (three images, showing the shell being measured with calipers and its dorsal and ventral aspects). Entries may be submitted by regular mail or e-mail; a submission form is included at the back of each print edition. These requirements mean that in some cases older or even current malacological literature may include size records which exceed those found in the registry.\n\nIn the early years of the registry, shells were sometimes officially measured for world record size status at Conchologists of America conventions, as in 1999 when the measurements were carried out by senior author Kim Hutsell.\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, several attempts were made to produce a list of the largest shell specimens. Perhaps the earliest of these was the Lost Operculum Club List of Champions, initiated in 1950 by John Q. Burch (1894–1974) of the Los Angeles-based Conchological Club of Southern California. This project was overseen by Bertram C. Draper (1904–2000) between 1966 and 1987, and bore four major print publications during this time. The list was limited in scope compared to later efforts, encompassing only marine species of the Eastern Pacific, from Alaska to Chile.\n\nThe direct predecessor to the \"Registry of World Record Size Shells\" was World Size Records, compiled by renowned malacologists Robert J. L. Wagner (1905–1992) and R. Tucker Abbott (1919–1995). These record sizes originally appeared in 1964, in the first edition of \"Van Nostrand's Standard Catalog of Shells\", not as a separate list but interspersed among other species-specific information that made up the bulk of the work. An updated list was published as part of the book's second edition, in 1967. The next update appeared in the work's third edition, which was renamed \"Wagner and Abbott's Standard Catalog of Shells\". Unlike previous editions, this third and final installment of the catalog was a ring binder with loose-leaf content, intended as a continually updated resource. To match the newly retitled work, the list's name was modified to Wagner and Abbott's World Size Records. In this final incarnation, the list appeared as a series of four supplements: the first two were loose-leaf publications that appeared in 1978 and 1982, and these were followed by hole-punched paperback titles in 1985 and 1990.\n\nFollowing the deaths of Wagner and Abbott, Barbara Haviland continued to compile data for world records. In 1997 Kim Hutsell acquired the rights from Cynthia Abbott to \"World Size Records\" to continue the project as a stand-alone book, those rights were subsequently sold to Don Pisor. The first edition therefore incorporated many of the earlier entries, as well as additional data compiled for \"World Size Records\" by Barbara Haviland. The format of the new publication differed from \"World Size Records\" in several important ways. Significantly, the minimum size threshold was lowered from to . In another change, the registry listed taxa alphabetically by species name within families, instead of within genera as they had been previously. This system allows for easy comparison between closely related genera, is more resilient to the frequent taxonomic changes that occur at the genus level, and gets around the issue that many shell dealers prefer to lump numerous genera for the sake of simplicity. R. Tucker Abbott had himself intended to use this arrangement in the fifth edition of his \"World Size Records\", but died before he could see his plans through. Another difference was the presentation of sizes in millimetres to the nearest tenth instead of centimetres to the nearest hundredth, moving the publication in line with standard usage in conchology. Finally, references were added for each specimen to aid in identification. The opening paragraph of the first edition set out the project's goals and invited submissions:\n\nWhile the importance of maximum shell size and its role in the overall scheme of Conchology and Malacology is debatable, it remains one point of continual interest among collectors and researchers. The purpose of the Registry of World Record Size Shells is to provide a single publication containing a list of the largest known specimens for as many shelled molluscan species as possible in a format designed for ease of use. Undoubtedly, specimens may exist, hidden in museums, universities and private collections, which exceed some of the sizes listed herein. It is the sincere hope of the editors that information concerning such specimens be shared with others by submitting accurate and verifiable records to the Registry of World Record Size Shells.\n\nKim C. Hutsell, Linda L. Hutsell and Don Pisor released the first three editions in 1997, 1999, and 2001. These were published by the Hutsell's company, Snail's Pace Productions, and distributed by Pisor's Marine Shells, both based in San Diego, California. The first edition went on sale at the 1997 Conchologists of America (COA) convention in Captiva Island, Florida. \n\nThe text of the fourth edition was completed by Kim and Linda Hutsell and originally planned for release at the 2003 COA convention in Tacoma, Washington, but was greatly delayed and only came out in 2005. The fifth edition appeared three years later. With the departure of the first two authors, the titles of the fourth and fifth editions were shortened to Pisor's Registry of World Record Size Shells. These also marked a switch from Snail's Pace Productions to a new main publisher, ConchBooks of Hackenheim, Germany. They were compiled with the help of Conchology, Inc., with the company's founder, Guido T. Poppe, providing an introduction for the fifth edition.\n\nOn 2 April 2008, the copyrights to the registry were transferred from Pisor to Jean-Pierre Barbier of Topseashells and Philippe Quiquandon of Shell's Passion. With Olivier Santini, Barbier and Quiquandon subsequently launched an official website where all registry listings can be accessed for a fee. The online database includes photographs of the listed specimens that have been gathered with the help of collectors, dealers, and institutions such as the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris. Older records for which photographic evidence could not be obtained were removed from the database and replaced by verified specimens, even if these were smaller, to ensure that all specimens were measured and identified correctly. Barbier, Quiquandon and Santini moved the print title to an annual publication cycle, starting with the sixth edition in 2009, with Shell's Passion and Topseashells taking over as publishers. Under the new ownership the print edition is titled simply Registry of World Record Size Shells.\n\nThe \"Lost Operculum Club List of Champions\" appeared in four main editions and at least one supplement between 1969 and 1987. Prior to this the list had appeared in abbreviated form in publications such as \"The Echo\".\n\n\n\"World Size Records\" originally appeared in the first and second editions of the \"Standard Catalog of Shells\" in 1964 and 1967, and then as four supplements to the third edition (one of which was titled a revision) between 1978 and 1990. A list of new entries—submitted for inclusion in \"World Size Records\" as of November 1987—appeared across the 1988 and 1989 issues of \"Hawaiian Shell News\".\n\n\nThe \"Registry of World Record Size Shells\" has appeared in fifteen print editions since 1997. New editions are currently released on an annual basis. All editions are of the approximate dimensions and have coil or comb binding, with heavy paper covers and a clear plastic sheet protecting the front cover.\n\n\nThe publishers announced that the 15th print edition will be the last, due to the excessive thickness of the publication.\n\nThe first edition of the \"Registry of World Record Size Shells\" was reviewed for Conchologists of America (COA) by malacologist Gary Rosenberg of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and conchologist Gene Everson.\n\nRosenberg spoke favourably of the changes made since \"World Size Records\", namely the lowering of the minimum size for inclusion, listing sizes in millimetres, ordering species alphabetically within families irrespective of genus, and adding a reference field for identification purposes. He also welcomed the inclusion of separate entries for infraspecific taxa such as subspecies, varieties, and forms, noting that these \"might someday prove to be full species, and maximum sizes might provide evidence as to their status\".\n\nRosenberg identified a minor inconsistency in the grouping of cephalopods (Argonautidae and Nautilidae) and scaphopods (Dentaliidae) with gastropods while listing bivalves separately, opining that \"a single alphabetic sequence would be preferable\". Rosenberg also found \"an unusual number of typographical errors\", which he attributed to a rush to have the work ready for the 1997 COA convention. Other issues identified by Rosenberg included the listing of synonyms (e.g. \"Oliva sericea\" and its synonym \"Oliva textilina\") and different combinations of the same species (e.g. \"Ancilla lienardi\" and \"Eburna lienardi\"). While suggesting that errors of the second type would be easier to catch if author citations were included, Rosenberg conceded that this might not be practical due to space limitations. Rosenberg also noted entries where the cited location fell well outside the species's natural range (e.g. a supposed West African specimen of the East African \"Ancilla ventricosa\").\n\nComparing around a quarter of the size records from the first edition against shells in the collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Rosenberg found that the latter had larger specimens in some 10% of cases. What Rosenberg considered \"[o]f greatest concern\", however, were discrepancies between the record sizes listed in the registry and larger specimens found in contemporary monographic works, and this even extended to type specimens in some cases. The problem seemed to be particularly pronounced in the Pleurotomariidae—a family highly prized by shell collectors—where nine out of sixteen species had larger shells listed in the standard work on the family, that of Anseeuw & Goto (1996). Similar issues were found with the record sizes of Terebridae. Rosenberg concluded: \"The Registry would be much more authoritative if it included record sizes from the literature, and I recommend this be done in future editions.\"\n\nGene Everson echoed Rosenberg in highlighting the changes from \"World Size Records\" as major improvements. In particular he praised the format and exhaustiveness of the publication, writing that, despite having almost double the entries of its predecessor, the registry was much easier to handle compared with the \"heavy and bulky\" \"Standard Catalog of Shells\". He added that the authors' choice of coil binding made it easier to keep the registry open at the desired page.\n\nEverson questioned some of the publication choices for the reference field, such as the conspicuous omission of \"the definitive work on New Zealand shells\", \"New Zealand Mollusca\" by Arthur William Baden Powell. He continued: \"Many other landmark works by highly respected malacologists are omitted, while articles in periodicals frequently written by amateurs, such as \"La Conchliglia\" and \"American Conchologist\", are [not]. It would seem the included 49 references were just those used by the authors for this edition.\" He suggested that future editions should clearly set out what types of references are acceptable. Summarising, Everson wrote:\n\nThis book is meant to be a useful, working and evolving tool and should not be nitpicked on details that are not relevant to its purpose. The authors are not producing a treatise on each family with hot-off-the-press reclassifications. I suspect they are following Vaught's classification which has been out for a few years, and is by no means perfect or up-to-date, but is readily available and inexpensive, and thus a good choice. But if so, this standard should be identified in the introduction, so that one knows where to find a shell. Also, typos are found in almost every book, and this is no exception, but they do not lessen the useful information, which is the main reason why we will buy this book. Two thumbs up!\n\nA review of the 11th edition criticised the lack of pagination and therefore of an index, as well as the lack of page headings indicating families.\n\n"}

The station broadcast rock and pop music to China, Japan, USSR, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries.\nThe idea for Superrock KYOI was first proposed in 1980, due to the popularity of shortwave radio in Japan, which led to the idea of using the medium of shortwave to satisfy Japanese teenagers' and young adults' appetite for Western pop and rock music, as the Western concept of Top-40 or Album Rock radio formats did not exist in Japan at the time. The station began transmitting December 17, 1982. Initial frequencies were 11.9, 15.19, 15.405, and 9.67 MHz. To promote a new standard of broadcasting, Superrock KYOI had a carefully selected name: \"Super\" having a very strong, positive meaning in Japan, and \"YOI\" meaning \"good\" in Japanese. With the slogan \"Super Rock\" and the promise of \"rock and roll from L.A.\" (although the station's headquarters were located in Honolulu, Hawaii), it was an instant hit not only in the intended target area of Japan, but also, unexpectedly, with listeners worldwide. Enthusiasm did not extend to advertisers in either Japan or the United States, however, as the station found it very hard to sell time, and by late 1985 was soliciting donations from listeners to help keep the station on the air. This strategy ultimately did not produce the needed cash flow and KYOI was put up for sale a few months later.\n\nIn December 1986, the Herald Broadcasting division of the Christian Science Monitor Syndicate Inc. purchased KYOI. Although the station's Top 40/CHR format was initially retained, it was increasingly interrupted over the next few years by news and religious programming. The station also began referring to itself as \"All Hit KYOI\" during this time. Broadcasts of music programs were completely terminated in 1989 with the station's callsign changing to KHBI and the format changing to full-time religion. In 1998 HBS sold the station to Radio Free Asia.\n\nSuperrock KYOI was located at Agingan point of Saipan island. Both studio and transmitter facilities were co-sited in the same building, a concrete structure designed to withstand hurricane winds of 150 miles per hour and earthquakes of magnitude 3 on the Richter scale. The entire plant was self-sufficient, with its own 450-kilowatt diesel generator and a 2,500-gallon water catchment system with filtering unit and compression tank. The station had a powerful transmitter, a Continental Electronics 418-D-2, 100-kilowatt high level plate modulated, with an automatic servo system, allowing pre-tuning of channels in use. Three tubes sat in tanks of distilled water that boiled off into steam and then condensed back into water to be returned to the system.\n\nThe antenna system consisted of a complex and elaborate array, composed of 16 dipoles phased together directed towards an azimuth of 340 degrees true. The program of broadcasting consisted of continuous top 40 rock music controlled primarily by a computer audio sequencing system, with automated song title and station identification announcements inserted as required. The same computer system was also used to change frequency 4 times daily, completely eliminating operator error. The music was run from a program automation system, which held up to seven days of twenty-four-hour programming. A time clock was incorporated allowing station IDs and frequency change announcements to be aired at predetermined times. Music, commercials and jingles were all called up from a series of carts also by the computer system.\n\nFrom its two towers, the latest in rock music was beamed to a primarily young Japanese audience of 18- to 30-year-olds from one end of Japan to the other. Among major advertisers supporting the station and its programs were Seiko, Sony, and Air Micronesia.\n\nThe main creator of station was Lawrence Berger; other owners were Fred Zeder, and Adrian Perry. The main operator of the KYOI station was the Marcom company. Technical facilities on Saipan employed just six staff, working as operators, antenna riggers and other devices which were needed to keep the station on the air around the clock. On-air announcements and station IDs were done in both English and Japanese and time checks were always given in Japan Standard Time.\n\nAll programs of Superrock KYOI were prepared in Los Angeles, California by the Drake-Chenault Company, and then air-freighted to Saipan. All programming was prerecorded or voice-tracked; the station employed no live announcers although song title and artist information were given in prerecorded announcements. KYOI retained a representative in Japan to advise the programmer of the latest in Japanese pop music trends. However, the music format consisted chiefly of Western pop and rock, with very few J-pop singles played; the playlist included a flavoring of oldies dating back to the 1960s in addition to current and recent hit records. On-air features included a weekly Top 30 countdown (presented in both English and Japanese), \"Music World\" music news briefs, and a modern rock music feature prepared by KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. Sales of airtime were made in Japan, and bills paid from Honolulu with most business being conducted by telephone and telex.\n\nKYOI received thousands of letters and reception reports, and acknowledged all reports with cards postmarked \"Saipan CM\". The station also hoped to encourage interest in Saipan as a vacation spot.\n\n"}
