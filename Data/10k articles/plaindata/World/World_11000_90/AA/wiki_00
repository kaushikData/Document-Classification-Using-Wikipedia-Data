The recorded magnitudes of the two main quakes were 5.9 and 5.8 , respectively, giving a composite magnitude of 6.1. There were no human fatalities, but 30 injuries were reported and a number of sheep were killed. The epicenter of the earthquake was between the towns of Hveragerði and Selfoss, about east-southeast of the capital, Reykjavík. It was the strongest earthquake to hit Iceland since the summer of 2000.\n\nIceland straddles the mid-Atlantic ridge where the Eurasian and North-American tectonic plates move away from each other. Volcanic activity is common along such divergent boundaries but strong earthquakes are rare. In Iceland the ridge is somewhat off-set, creating two transform faults where plates move horizontally along each other. One is in the north of the country and one in the south; the strongest Icelandic earthquakes happen along those transform faults. The 29 May quake is classified by geologists as typical \"Suðurlandsskjálftar\" (literally: Southern Iceland quakes), which happen on the southern fault.\n\nUnlike the quakes in the summer of 2000, the 29 May quake happened in the most densely populated part of the South Iceland district. The population of the affected area is about 12,000 and it includes the towns of Selfoss and Hveragerði as well as Eyrarbakki, Stokkseyri and Þorlákshöfn. Many farms were also affected.\n\n\n\n"}

Bangladesh and Austria have put emphasis on educational exchange programs between the two countries. Bangladesh has sought Austria's cooperation to increase the number of Austrian scholarship for Bangladeshi students.\n\nBangladesh and Austria have shown their deep interest to expand the bilateral economic activities between the two countries and have been taking necessary steps in this regard.

{"id": "1675118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1675118", "title": "Babar Islands", "text": "Babar Islands\n\nThe Babar Islands \"(\"Indonesian: \"Kepulauan Babar)\" are located in Maluku Province, Indonesia between latitudes 7 degrees 31 minutes South to 8 degrees 13 minutes South and from longitudes 129 degrees 30 minutes East to 130 degrees 05 minutes East. Tepa (a town with a population of about 2,000 people) is the administrative center of the Babar Islands municipality (\"Kecamatan Kepulauan Babar\") now reduced to encompass only the western half of Babar Island, Wetang Island (lying to the west of Babar) and Dai Island (to the north). The town of Letwurung on the east side of Babar island is the capital of the new municipality called \"East Babar\" (\"Kecamatan Babar Timor\") in the east half of the Babar Islands, consisting of the East half of Babar Island, Masela Island (to the south-east of Babar), and Dawera Island and Dawelor Island (to the east).\n\nThe islands take their name from the large central island of Babar which is roughly across and a circumference of . Babar Island has a maximum elevation of approximately 750 meters and is lightly covered with sub-tropical montane forest, although the 5 rivers and 2 large year-round springs afford tropical forest in their narrow ravine courses.\n\nThe topography of all the Babar islands is distinctive for their marked stepped appearance, the result of a combination of periodic uplifting of the tectonic plate interacting with the erosive action of the constant ocean waves. Water action on the coral base over the millennia has created many caves and shafts.\n\nRain is plentiful from December to July so corn, plantains, bananas, cassava, various tubers and red rice (unirrigated) grow plentifully. Fish is the main source of protein. Sufficient potable water on Babar Island is provided by year round springs and shallow wells. Coconut oil is important for consumption while the oily meat called copra, is sold. Other items harvested and sold for export are sea shells, sea weed, sea cucumbers, shark fins, live lizards and birds, cattle, cashews, nutmeg, cloves and eucalyptus oil.\n\nThis situation contrasts markedly with the much smaller islands ringing Babar Island. These are low-lying, uplifted reef and limestone (with the exception of Dai Island, which is largely granite), infertile, not heavily forested and lacking in fresh water sources. The more difficult environment leads the indigenous inhabitants to focus more of their energies on fishing and hand-crafts which are then traded for garden produce from Babar Island. The people collect rain water in large above ground cisterns which can last them through the driest time of the year (September to December). When the drought is longer than usual the water in these tanks is exhausted and the people have to walk miles to the few villages with springs or wells, and queue up for a turn to draw a few liters of water. People camp overnight beside the well waiting their turn. The Indonesian government has provided funds for many more collection tanks for rain water, so the situation has improved markedly in the last few years.\n\nThere is no airport or landing strip in the Babar Islands. Small freighters that have contracts to carry passengers service the islands. It is a minimum twelve-hour ride to the nearest city with an airport where one can catch a commercial flight to other towns in Maluku being Tual, Larat, Wonreli (Kisar) and Ambon.\n\nIn comparison to the majority of Indonesians living nearer the political centre of the country, the indigenous Babar Islanders tend to darker epidermal pigmentation, have kinky hair and generally lack the epicanthic eyefold of East Asians.\n\nMost indigenous Babar Islanders are baptised into the Protestant Church of Maluku (Gereja Protestan Maluku, GPM). The GPM's roots are in the Dutch Reformed Church started by the Dutch colonists. Due undoubtedly to the aridity of the islands and the lack of natural resources, there has been no mass transmigration from more populous Indonesian areas. In Tepa, there are 3 other denominations with church buildings: a Catholic church, a Seventh-day Adventist church, and a Pentecostal church. There is also a mosque in Tepa that serves the small community of Muslims. All the other towns have one GPM church each, totaling 56 GPM churches in the entire GPM diocese of Babar islands (\"Klasis GPM Pulau-pulau Babar\"). While these world faiths are represented, there is much hybridization with the preexisting animist beliefs and practices. The traditional dance of Babar is \"Seka\". \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1040123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1040123", "title": "National interest", "text": "National interest\n\nThe national interest, often referred to by the French expression raison d'État (\"reason of State\"), is a country's goals and ambitions, whether economic, military, cultural or otherwise. The concept is an important one in international relations, where pursuit of the national interest is the foundation of the realist school.\n\nIn early human history the national interest was usually viewed as secondary to that of religion or morality. To engage in a war rulers needed to justify the action in these contexts. The first thinker to advocate for the primacy of the national interest is usually considered to be Niccolò Machiavelli.\n\nThe practice is first seen as being employed by France under the direction of its Chief Minister Cardinal Richelieu in the Thirty Years' War when it intervened on the Protestant side, despite its own Catholicism, to block the increasing power of the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor. At Richelieu's prompting, Jean de Silhon defended the concept of reason of state as \"a mean between what conscience permits and affairs require.\" The notion of the national interest soon came to dominate European politics that became fiercely competitive over the next centuries. It is a form of reason \"born of the calculation and the ruse of men\" and makes of the state \"a knowing machine, a work of reason\"; the state ceases to be derived from the divine order and is henceforth subject to its own particular necessities.\n\nStates could now openly embark on wars purely out of self-interest. Mercantilism can be seen as the economic justification of the aggressive pursuit of the national interest.\n\nA foreign policy geared towards pursuing the national interest is the foundation of the realist school of international relations. The realist school reached its greatest heights at the Congress of Vienna with the practice of the balance of powers, which amounted to balancing the national interest of several great and lesser powers.\n\nMetternich was celebrated as the principal artist and theoretician of this balancing but he was simply doing a more or less clean copy of what his predecessor Kaunitz had already done by reversing so many of the traditional Habsburg alliances and building international relations anew on the basis of national interest instead of religion or tradition.\n\nThese notions became much criticized after the bloody debacle of the First World War, and some sought to replace the concept of the balance of power with the idea of collective security, whereby all members of the League of Nations would \"consider an attack upon one as an attack upon all,\" thus deterring the use of violence for ever more. The League of Nations did not work, partially because the United States refused to join and partially because, in practice, nations did not always find it \"in the national interest\" to deter each other from the use of force.\n\nThe events of World War II along with World War I, led to a rebirth of Realist and then Neo-realist thought, as international relations theorists re-emphasized the role of power in global governance. Many IR theorists blamed the weakness of the League of Nations for its idealism (contrasted with Realism) and ineffectiveness at preventing war, even as they blamed mercantilist beggar thy neighbor policies for the creation of fascist states in Germany and Italy. With hegemonic stability theory, the concept of the U.S. national interest was expanded to include the maintenance of open sea lanes and the maintenance and expansion of free trade.\n\nThe majority of the jurists consider that the national interest is incompatible with the rule of law. Regarding this, Antonino Troianiello has said that national interest and a state subject to the rule of law are not absolutely incompatible:While the notion of state reason comes first as a theme of study in political science, it is a very vague concept in law and has never been an object of systematic study. This obvious lack of interest is due to a deliberate epistemological choice - a form of positivism applied to legal science; and as a result legal science affirms its autonomy regarding other social sciences while constituting with exactness its own object - law - in order to describe it. In doing so it implies deterministic causes which have an influence on its descriptive function. This method which puts aside state reason is not without any consequence: the fact that state reason is not taken into account by legal science is to be integrated within a global rejection of a description of law as presented in political science. A fundamental dynamic in modern constitutionalism, \"the seizure of the political phenomenon by law\" is all the more remarkable when it claims a scientific value, thus a neutrality aiming at preventing all objection. This convergence of legal science and constitutionalism has the tautological character of a rhetorical discourse in which law is simultaneously the subject and the object of the discourse on law. Having as a basis state reason, it allows a reflexion on the legitimacy of power and authority of modern Western societies; this in connexion with the representations which make it and which it makes \"state reason and public law.\"\n\nToday, the concept of \"the national interest\" is often associated with political realists who fail to differentiate their policies from \"idealistic\" policies to seek to inject morality into foreign policy or promote solutions that rely on multilateral institutions which might weaken the independence of the state.\n\nAs considerable disagreement exists in every country over what is or is not in \"the national interest,\" the term is as often invoked to justify isolationist and pacifistic policies as to justify interventionist or warlike policies. It has been posited that the term is a euphemism used by powerful countries for geopolitical aims such as nonrenewable natural resources for energy independency, territorial expansionism and precious metals in smaller countries. In that case, euphemism usage is necessary to stifle voices opposed to an interventionistic or warhawk foreign policy.\n\n\n"}

According to MARPOL 73/78 they must be collected by the Port reception facilities all around the world. The Port reception facility must be able to receive dirty oil and other contaminants, and also provide quick and efficient services.\n\nIn March 2006, MEPC 54 emphasized the value of reception facilities that would exceed expectations in the implementation of MARPOL, and introduced a policy of \"zero tolerance of illegal discharges from ships\" that could only be enforced when there were adequate reception facilities in ports. Therefore, the Committee urged all Parties to MARPOL, particularly port States, to fulfill their treaty obligations to provide reception facilities for wastes generated during the normal operation of ships.\n\nIn October 2006, MEPC 55 approved an Action Plan to help the problems faced by port reception facilities. This was seen as a major challenge to overcome in order to achieve full compliance with MARPOL. The Plan was introduced by the Sub-Committee on Flag State Implementation (FSI) in order to better implement MARPOL and to increase environmental consciousness among shipping.\n\nA new plan to manage the waste must be found and ships must be encouraged to use the port reception facilities rather than to discharge waste anywhere in the ocean. As a response, the European Community adopted the Directive 2000/59/EC on port reception facilities with the goal of eliminating discharges of ship-generated residues into the ocean. The Directive is especially aimed at increasing the prevalence and use of port reception facilities, thereby securing a cleaner and more sustainable marine environment. These ideologies were previously addressed by the MARPOL 73/78 Convention in 1973, however Member States are still encountering difficulties in fully implementing the requirements.\n\nThe Port Reception Facility Database (PRFD) went online 1 March 2006, as a module of the IMO Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS). The database logs data on reception facilities detailing each category of ship-generated waste.\n\nThe Annexes of MARPOL contain detailed regulations with respect to the six main groups of harmful materials: Petroleum in any form (Annex I); Noxious Liquid Substances (NLS) carried in bulk (Annex II); Harmful substances carried in packaged form (Annex III); Sewage (Annex IV); Garbage (Annex V); and Air emissions (Annex VI).\n\nMARPOL states that contaminants cannot be discharged into the ocean in line with the requirements stated in its annexes should be dropped of at port reception facilities. It also says that port States need to ensure that there are enough port reception facilities throughout the area to help with convenience.\n\nIn 2009, IMO created Guide to the Good Practice for Port Reception Facilities Providers and Users. MEPC.1/Circ.671. This document describes the steps that need to be taken in order to effectively dispose of waste by ships at port reception facilities.\n\nNext in 2012, IMO released the MARPOL Requirements for Port Reception Facilities. This lists the requirements for port reception facilities to ensure that waste can be discharged without undue delay. It also discusses long standing lack of PRFs and under reporting.\n\nAnother important step was when IMO published their Standard Format for the Advanced Notification Form for Waste Delivery to Port Reception Facilities. This document details the standard format for notification by the ship to a port facility for acceptance of shipboard waste. This form should be submitted 24 hours prior to arrival.\n\n"}

{"id": "1714223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1714223", "title": "Sunda Shelf", "text": "Sunda Shelf\n\nGeologically, the Sunda Shelf is a southeast extension of the continental shelf of Southeast Asia. Major landmasses on the shelf include the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Madura, Bali and their surrounding smaller islands. It covers an area of approximately 1.85 million km. Sea depths over the shelf rarely exceed 50 metres and extensive areas are less than 20 metres resulting in strong bottom friction and strong tidal friction. Steep undersea gradients separate the Sunda Shelf from the Philippines, Sulawesi, and the Lesser Sunda Islands.\n\nBiogeographically, Sundaland is a term for the region of Southeastern Asia which encompasses these areas of the Asian continental shelf that were exposed during the last ice age. Sundaland included the Malay Peninsula on the Asian mainland, as well as the large islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra and their surrounding islands. The same steep undersea gradients that mark the eastern boundary of Sundaland are identified biogeographically by the Wallace Line, identified by Alfred Russel Wallace, which marks the eastern boundary of Asia's land mammal fauna, and is the boundary of the Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones.\n\nThe shelf has resulted from millennia of volcanic activity and erosion of the Asian continental mass, and the build up and consolidation of debris along the margins as sea levels rose and fell.\n\nThe seas between the islands cover relatively stable ancient pene-plains that are characterised by low seismicity, low isostatic gravity anomalies and no active volcanoes with the exception of Sumatra, Java, and Bali, which while connected to the Sunda Shelf, belong geologically to the young Sunda Arc orogenic system (i.e., the Sunda Mountain System). During glacial periods, the sea level falls, and great expanses of the Sunda Shelf are exposed as a marshy plain. The rise of sea level during a meltwater pulse 14,600 to 14,300 years Before Present was as much as 16 meters within 300 years.\n\nPresent sea levels submerge a number of Pleistocene paleo river systems that drained much of Sundaland during the last glacial maximum 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.\n\nTo the east of the Sunda Shelf is the Sahul Shelf. Separating these two regions of shallow seas is Wallacea, which encompasses Sulawesi and the thousands of smaller islands making up Nusa Tenggara and Maluku. Within Wallacea lie some of the deepest seas in the world, with depths of up to 7,000 metres. Passing between Bali and Lombok, and Borneo and Sulawesi, Wallacea is marked by a transition zone of flora and fauna first described by Alfred Russel Wallace. The complicated history of island formation on the Sunda Shelf and changing landbridge connections with mainland Southeast Asia have resulted in a high degree of endemism and local distribution discontinuities, discussed at Sundaland, the biogeographical province that has resulted from these changes.\n\nThe exposure of the Sunda Shelf during eustatic sea level changes has effects on the El Niño oscillation.\n\nW. Earle in 1845 was the first to describe the general features of the Sunda and Sahul Shelves, which he termed the \"Great Asiatic Bank\" and the \"Great Australian Bank\" respectively.\n\nThe paleo river systems of the Sunda Shelf are vast submerged river systems that extend present-day river systems and may be interpreted to follow topographic lows in a down-slope direction. During the driest period of the Pleistocene era (about 17,000 years BP) some four distinct catchment areas form the \"Malacca\", \"Siam\" and \"Sunda\" river systems.\n\nThe \"Siam river system\" consists of a northern and a western arm. The northern arm extends the Chao Phraya River to drain the Gulf of Thailand. The western arm forming out of some rivers in central Sumatra flows through the Singapore Straits before joining up with the northern arm to empty into an estuary and the South China Sea to the north of North Natuna Island.\n\nThe \"Malacca Straits river system\" is formed by a joining of waters from northeastern Sumatra and the western Malayan Peninsula, draining into the Andeman Sea.\n\nThe \"Northern Sunda river system\", also known as the Great Sunda river system, or Molengraaff river system, was named after a Dutch biologist and geologist who traveled the region extensively in the late 19th century and first proposed the existence of this river system based on his observations in Borneo. The river, arising between Belitung Island and Borneo, flowed in a northeasterly direction, where it collected waters from some rivers in Central Sumatra and the rivers in Western and Northern Borneo, before flowing into the South China Sea between the North and South Natuna Islands. \nFinally the \"Eastern Sunda river system\" emptied northern Java and southern Borneo, flowing in an easterly direction between Borneo and Java into the Java Sea.\n\n"}
{"id": "4429350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4429350", "title": "Tax residence", "text": "Tax residence\n\nThe criteria for residence for tax purposes vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and \"residence\" can be different for other, non-tax purposes. For individuals, physical presence in a jurisdiction is the main test. Some jurisdictions also determine residency of an individual by reference to a variety of other factors, such as the ownership of a home or availability of accommodation, family, and financial interests. For companies, some jurisdictions determine the residence of a corporation based on its place of incorporation. Other jurisdictions determine the residence of a corporation by reference to its place of management. Some jurisdictions use both a place-of-incorporation test and a place-of-management test.\n\nDomicile is, in common law jurisdictions, a different legal concept to residence, though the two may lead to the same result.\n\nThe criteria for residence in double taxation treaties may be different from those of domestic law. Residency in domestic law allows a country to create a tax claim based on the residence over a person, whereas in a double taxation treaty it has the effect of restricting such tax claim in order to avoid double taxation. Residency or citizenship taxation systems are typically linked with worldwide taxation, as opposed to territorial taxation. Therefore, it is particularly relevant when two countries simultaneously claim a person to be resident within their jurisdiction.\n\nDouble taxation treaties generally follow the OECD Model Convention. Other relevant models are the UN Model Convention, in the case of treaties with developing countries and the US Model Convention, in the case of treaties negotiated by the United States.\n\nThe OECD Model Convention and the UN Model Convention are identical. They first provide for a definition of \"resident of a Contracting State\":\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term \"resident of a Contracting State\" means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or capital situated therein.\nThe definition is followed by \"tie-breaker\" rules for individuals and non-individuals, which result in the person being considered resident in only one of the countries:\n\nThe US Model Convention is similar to the OECD and UN Model Convention with respect to residency of individuals. However, if non-individuals are considered to be residents of two countries, the default result is that they shall be considered resident of none for the purposes of claiming the benefits of the tax treaty. The countries will engage in mutual agreement procedures to reach a decision. Therefore, domestic taxation will continue as normal until an agreement is reached.\n\nThe Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project developed by the OECD and endorsed by the G-20 reached a critical milestone in October 2015, where final deliverables for 15 Actions were presented. Paragraph 48 of Action 6's final deliverable indicated a new wording for the \"tie-breaker\" relating to non-individuals, whereas it will no longer be automatically determined in the forthcoming revision of the model. According to the new wording, the \"tie-breaker\" will depend entirely on mutual agreement between both countries:3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting State, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Convention, having regard to its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption form tax provided by this Convention except to the extent and in such manner as may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States.\n\nPending work on BEPS Action 15, concerning the development of a 'Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties' may result on the amendment of a large number of existing treaties to reflect, particularly, the new wording in Action 6. There are currently a considerable number of counties involved in this instrument's negotiation but it is still unclear what changes and what countries will agree to the changes. The work on the multilateral instrument will be concluded and open of signature in December 31, 2016.\n\nA company is generally treated as resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes if it is incorporated in the United Kingdom or, if the company is not incorporated in the United Kingdom, if its central management and control are exercised in the United Kingdom. \"Central management and control\" refers to the highest level of oversight, usually as exercised by the board, rather than day-to-day management.\n\nAn individual who spends more than 183 days in the UK in a tax year is UK resident. Apart from that, there are no clear statutory guidelines. The question of whether someone is UK resident is a question of fact and degree, to be determined \"on all the circumstances of the case.\" The vagueness of this test has often been criticised. Viscount Sumner said in Levene v IRC:\n\nSimilarly, the Codification Committee concluded:\n\nMore recently, the Chartered Institute of Taxation concluded:\n\nThe number of days present in the UK is not a decisive factor (unless the number of days exceeds 183 in a tax year). In one case a foreigner who spent 5 months in the UK was held not UK resident. In the view of HMRC someone who exceeds 90 days on a four-year average is UK resident, but considerable emphasis is given to the fact that someone who averages less than 90 days may also be UK resident.\n\nBefore 2009/10, the vagueness of the law did not seem to matter because HMRC published relatively clear guidelines in document IR20. That document has been withdrawn from 2009/10 and replaced with the much vaguer guidance in HMRC 6.\n\nHMRC currently argue that they are not bound by the terms of IR20 for years prior to 2009/10. Whether that is correct is currently the subject of litigation. It is clear that HMRC are not in any way bound by the terms of HMRC 6, which contains a very full disclaimer.\n\nAll tax resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income, regardless of the source. This would include salary, dividends, etc. earned from one's limited company. Generally, individuals are deemed to be tax resident if they are physically present in Germany for more than six months in any one calendar year or for a consecutive period of six months over a calendar year-end. This ruling is applied retrospectively so presence in Germany from 1 March to 30 November, for example, would make one a German tax resident and therefore subject to German tax on the worldwide income for the entire period rather than just from the beginning of the seventh month.\n\nAn individual can also be deemed tax resident if they acquire an abode in Germany. This can include renting, as opposed to purchasing, a property but only if the duration of the lease is deemed to be more than temporary. For this reason, to avoid German tax residency, short-term (such as three months) should be taken out wherever possible.\n\nNon-resident individuals are taxed on German-source income only. In the case of salary and benefits from your limited company, the source is German since the duties of the employment are being performed in Germany. However, dividends from your limited company (assuming this is not deemed to have a permanent establishment in Germany: see below) would be from a non-German source regardless of where the dividends are received. There is, therefore, scope for tax mitigation here if one does not become a German tax resident (although non-German taxes may also need to be considered).\n\nIn France, taxpayers are either \"domiciled\" in France or are \"non-resident\". Domiciled individuals are subject to French tax on worldwide income, but non-residents are not taxed on foreign-source income. Many treaty exemptions may apply, however (e.g. foreign-source trading or rental income). Under Article 4B of the French Tax Code (\"Code Général des Impôts\"), an individual is resident in France for tax purposes if:\n\nFrench courts have ruled that the principal place of physical presence test is only applicable where the \"home\" test cannot be applied. A \"home\" is to be construed as the place where the taxpayer normally lives, without any regard being given to the taxpayer's temporary stays in another country. As the \"home\" test is concerned with where the taxpayer's family ties are (i.e. where the spouse and children live), this test is highly unlikely to apply to single individuals. Consequently, the principal place of physical presence test should be viewed as primarily applicable to single individuals only.\n\n\"Principal place of physical presence\" covers a wider range of situations that a basic 183-day rule would have. This is because the taxpayer's physical presence in France in a given calendar year will be tested against his presence in another country. Perpetual travelers must therefore be able to demonstrate that they have resided in a foreign country for a longer period in the relevant calendar year.\n\nIn Russian Federation all tax resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income, regardless of the source. Individuals are deemed to be tax residents if they are physically present in Russia for more than 183 days during consecutive period of 12 months. The period of presence in Russia is not interrupted in case individual is out of the country for less than six months for educational purposes or for medical treatment. Foreign servants and civil servants that were sent abroad for work purposes are deemed tax residents no matter how long they really are present in Russia.\n\n\n"}
