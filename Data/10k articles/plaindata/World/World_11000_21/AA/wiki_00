Agisymba was located near the lake Chad, in those centuries bigger than what it is today.\n\nPtolemy's account is based on that written by Marinus of Tyre between 107 AD and 115 AD. Between the years 83 AD and 92 AD, the king of the Garamantes claimed that the Agisymba population were his subjects. \n\nModern historians suggest that Agisymba was probably somewhere to the north of Lake Chad as the Chad area is populated with many mountains. One theory is that Agisymba was an antecedent of the Kanem Empire located on the northern shore of Lake Chad. \n\nIndeed Ptolomeus wrote that around 90 AD Julius Maternus (or Matiernus) did a mainly commercial expedition. From the Sirte gulf he reached the Oasis of Cufra and the Oasis of Archei, then arrived -after 4 months travelling with the king of the Garamantes- to the river Bahr Salamat and Bahr Aouk, near the actual Central African Republic in a region then called Agisymba.

Nowadays, the Iberian plate is a part of the Eurasian plate.\n\nThe Iberian plate came into existence during the Cadomian Orogeny of the late Neoproterozoic, about 650–550 Ma, on the margin of the Gondwana continent, involving the collisions and accretion of the island arcs of the Central Iberian Plate, Ossa-Morena Plate, South Portuguese Plate. The three plates have never separated substantially from each other since that time .\n\nIn the Mesozoic, Late Jurassic Africa started moving east, and the Alpine Tethys opened. Subsidence related to this caused deep deposits of sediments on the east and some sediment remnants in pop downs in central parts of Spain. Two stages of rifting occurred in the east, one from Later Permian to Triassic, and the second from Late Jurassic to early Cretaceous.\n\nOn the south side deposits of carbonates and clastic sediments formed a shelf in shallow water during late Triassic and Liassic times. This was rifted in Toarcian times (Early Jurassic 190 Ma). Active rifting was complete by 160 Ma. After this thermal subsidence occurred till the end of Cretaceous. During this time rifting separated North America from Africa forming a transform zone . In the late Triassic and early Jurassic there were two stages of rifting involving extension and subsidence on the western margin of Iberia. It also extended the western margin. The Iberian Abyssal Plain, off the west coast of Portugal and Spain, formed 126 Ma. This separated Newfoundland's Grand Banks, with Galicia Bank and Flemish Cap being split at 118 Ma. By Early Cretaceous, 110 Ma rifting occurs on west and north west edges.\n\nDuring the time of the supercontinent Pangea, the Iberian plate was joined to Armorica (Northern France). During the break-up of Pangea, in the early Cretaceous, the Bay of Biscay started opening around 126 Ma and completed by 85 Ma. This created the Biscay Abyssal Plain, and parted the Iberian plate from the Trevelyan Escarpment. During this time Iberia rotated anticlockwise relative to Eurasia. This caused the subduction of the Ligurian Basin onto the eastern side. This formed the Betic nappe stack. After 85 Ma the Atlantic Ocean opening started between Ireland and Greenland. This left the Bay of Biscay as a failed rift .\n\nThe rotation of the Iberia and its relation to the formation of the Pyrenees has been difficult to decipher with certainty. Detailed aeromagnetic measurements from the sea floor offshore of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to show that Iberia moved as part of the African plate from late Cretaceous to mid-Eocene time, with a plate boundary extending westward from the Bay of Biscay. When motion along this boundary ceased, a boundary linking extension in the King's Trough to compression along the Pyrenees came into existence.\n\nSince the late Oligocene, the Iberian plate has been moving as part of the Eurasian plate, with the boundary between Eurasia and Africa situated along the Azores–Gibraltar fracture zone.\n\nContinued rotation of the Iberian plate in the early Miocene once again separated the Iberian plate from Eurasia opening the Betic Corridor a strait of water connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Atlantic Ocean. As the Iberian plate rotated, it closed the Betic Corridor approximately 5.96 million years ago during the Messinian period of the Miocene, precipitating the Messinian Salinity Crisis, a period when the Mediterranean Sea evaporated partly or completely .\n\nThe core of the Iberian Peninsula consists of a Hercynian cratonic block known as the Iberian Massif. On the northeast this is bounded by The Pyrenean fold belt, and on the southeast it is bounded by the Betic Foldchain. These twofold chains are part of the Alpine belt. To the west, the peninsula is delimited by the continental boundary formed by the magma poor opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Hercynian Foldbelt is mostly buried by Mesozoic and Tertiary cover rocks to the east, but nevertheless outcrops through the Iberian Chain and the Catalan Coastal Ranges.\n\n"}

After the Sri Lankan Civil War ended in May 2009 with military defeat of the LTTE the Sri Lankan government/military re-commenced destroying LTTE war cemeteries and other memorials for dead LTTE members. In July 2010 the Sri Lankan military destroyed Kopay war cemetery. The cemetery had had 2,000 graves.\n\nThe Sri Lankan military then started building an army base on the site of the cemetery.

There are questions of who should pay taxes and how much should he pay.\nUsually, the individual is receiving a net pay, which is the money he would have received in his home country after taxation. However, the company is obliged to pay taxes for its employee. If they are working in a country with lower taxes, the company takes the savings. On the other hand, if they work in country with higher taxation, the company pays the excess. Either way, the amount received by the employee is same. If the policy only benefits the employee (reducing taxes if working abroad results in higher taxes, but not raising them if working abroad results in lower taxes), then it is referred to as a tax protection policy.\n\nThe term \"tax equalization\" is also used by some American states, such as Nebraska and North Dakota to refer to property appraisal in the context of property tax.\n\nThe idea is that an individual´s income stays same.There are some steps how to determine the tax:\n\nCalculate the amount of money paid on taxes in individual´s home country. This sum of money is the hypothetical tax liability.\n\nReduce the pay of the individual by his/her tax liability.\n\nAdd any allowance that is necessary to be paid while he is abroad as a result of an assignment. This is his/her net assignment pay.\nAlthough it may appear easy to calculate your net pay, there are some other difficulties influencing your net pay. For example, if you are using company car in your home country, should you receive some subsidies when you are abroad and unable to use it?\nOr how is your partner´s income treated?\n\nFor whom is the split-year tax system beneficial?\n\nWhat if an individual leaves the company?\n\nDoes your tax equalisation policy discourage individuals from acquiring property abroad?\nand many more.\n\nIn practice, it is usually about agreement of both sides. Both parties should know on which basis is the tax calculated. After this is calculated, the amount is deducted from individual´s net pay on a regular basis throughout his assignment abroad. It is common, that the company deducts a hypothetical liability at the beginning of the year and then undertakes tax reconciliation at the end of the year.\n\n"}
