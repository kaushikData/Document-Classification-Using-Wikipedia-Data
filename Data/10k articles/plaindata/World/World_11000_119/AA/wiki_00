The formation consists of marine clay and sand, deposited in the shallow sea that covered northern and central Belgium in the Eocene epoch.\n\nThe Aalter Formation crops out in the provinces of East- and West-Flanders and forms a maximally 30 meters thick layer in the subsurface. To the east, the formation wedges out and becomes thinner. Due to this wedging out, the formation does not occur anymore in the province of Antwerpen. The base of the formation consists of glauconiferous clayey sand alternating with organic rich (humus and peat) layers (the Aalterbrugge Member). On top of this is a sequence of clay, sand and sandstone layers, rich in fossils (the Beernem Member). The top of the formation consists of fossil rich, glauconiferous fine sand (the Oedelem Member).\n\nThe Aalter Formation was formed during the late Ypresian to early Lutetian ages, giving it an age of around 48 million years. It is part of the Zenne Group and is covered by the Brussel Formation. If the Brussel Formation is absent, the Lede Formation can be found on top of the Aalter Formation.

{"id": "26376332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26376332", "title": "Antarctic microorganism", "text": "Antarctic microorganism\n\nAntarctica is one of the most physically and chemically extreme terrestrial environments to be inhabited by microorganisms. Nonetheless, on February 6, 2013, scientists reported that bacteria were found living in the cold and dark in a lake buried a half-mile deep () under the ice in Antarctica. This finding was later confirmed by scientists on August 20, 2014.\n\nAlthough most of the continent is covered by glacial ice sheets, ice-free areas comprising approximately 0.4% of the continental land mass are discontinuously distributed around the coastal margins. The McMurdo Dry Valleys region of Antarctica is a polar desert characterized by extremely low annual precipitation and an absence of vascular plants and vertebrates; microbial activity dominates biological functioning. Mean summer high and winter low temperatures in the dry valleys are Because precipitation is both infrequent and low, seasonal water availability in hydrologically connected soils make areas adjacent to water bodies more hospitable relative to dry upland soils. Polar ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate change, where small changes in temperature result in greater changes in local hydrology, dramatically affecting ecosystem processes.\n\nSoils in Antarctica are nearly two-dimensional habitats, with most biological activity limited to the top four or five inches by the permanently frozen ground below. Environments can be limiting due to soil properties such as unfavorable mineralogy, texture, structure, salts, pH, or moisture relationships. Visible sources of organic matter are absent for most of continental Antarctica. Dry Valley soil ecosystems are characterized by large variations in temperature and light regimes, steep chemical gradients and a high incidence of solar radiation with an elevated ultraviolet B (UVB) light component. Dry Valley soils originate from weathering of bedrock and glacial tills that consist of granites, sandstones, basalts and metamorphic rocks. Space within these rocks provide protection for microorganisms against some (but not all) of these conditions: i.e., protection from wind scouring and surface mobility, a reduction in UV exposure, reduced desiccation and enhanced water availability, and thermal buffering. Half of the soils in the Dry Valleys have subsurface ice, either as buried massive ice or as ice-cemented soil (permafrost). The permafrost layer is typically within of the soil surface.\n\nThe harsh environment and low availability of carbon and water support a simplified community of mosses, lichens, and mats of green algae and red, orange, and black cyanobacteria near lakes and ephemeral streams. Living among the mats are bacteria, yeasts, molds, and an array of microscopic invertebrates that feed on microbes, algae, and detritus: nematodes, protozoa, rotifers, tardigrades, and occasionally, mites and springtails. Even simpler communities exist in the arid soils that occupy the majority of the landscape.\n\nMicrobes in Antarctica adapt to aridity the same way microbes in hot deserts do: when water becomes scarce, the organisms simply dry up, shut down metabolic activity, and wait in a cryptobiotic state until water again becomes available. Microbes can also go dorminant in a cryptobiotic state known as anhydrobiosis when they become dehydrated due to low water availability. A more extreme survival method would be long term natural cryopreservation. Samples of permafrost sediments aged 5–10 thousand to 2-3 million years old have been found to contain viable micromycete and bacterial cells.\n\nAlgae is present in almost all ice-free areas and occurs in soils, as epiphytes on mosses, in cyanobacterial mats and in plankton of lakes and ponds. It is also possible to find algae associated with rocks or living in the thin film of melted water in the snow patches. Presently there are over 300 algal taxa identified on Antarctica, with Bacillariophyceae (Diatoms) and Chlorophyta (Green algae) being the most widespread on Antarctica. Diatoms are abundant in aquatic environments decreasing in number in terrestrial habitats. Chlorophyta are also important in mats in lakes and ponds but tend to increase their relative importance in terrestrial environments and especially in soils, where they are the densest algal group. Xanthophyceae (Yellow-green algae) are an important component of the flora in soils of Antarctica. Other algal groups (Dinophyta, Cryptophyta, and Euglenophyta) are mainly limited to freshwater communities of the Dry Valleys.\n\nAlgae species identified in recent research:\n\nDistribution of arthropods is limited to areas of high soil moisture and/or access to water, such as streams, or snow meltwater. The springtail \"Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni\" is endemic and restricted to southern Victoria Land between Mt. George Murray (75°55′S) and Minna Bluff (78°28′S) and to the adjacent nearshore islands.\n\nMite species identified in recent research:\n\nSpringtail species identified in recent research:\n\nCarbon appears to be more important than moisture in defining good habitats for nematodes in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. \"Scottnema lindsayae\", a microbial feeder and the most abundant and widely distributed metazoan invertebrate, often occurs as the sole metazoan species in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. It makes its living eating bacteria and yeast out in the dry, salty soils that dominate the valleys. All other invertebrate species are more abundant in moist or saturated soils where algae and moss are more abundant. Distribution of most nematode species is correlated negatively with elevation (due to temperature and precipitation) and salinity, and positively with soil moisture, soil organic matter, and nutrient availability. \"Eudorylaimus\" spp. is the second most abundant nematode, followed by \"Plectus murrayi\" who are the least abundant nematodes. \"Plectus antarcticus\" eats bacteria and prefers living in ephemeral streams. An average 2-pound bag of dry valley soils contains approximately 700 nematodes, while the more fertile soil found at higher latitudes on the continent may contain approximately 4,000 nematodes.\n\nNematode species identified in recent research:\n\nThe three species listed below were found in moss-dominated moist soils.\n\nRotifer species identified in recent research:\n\nTardigrade species identified in recent research:\n\nTypically, the highest numbers of cultured bacteria are from relatively moist coastal soils, compared with the small bacteria communities of dry inland soils. Cyanobacteria are found in all types of aquatic habitats and often dominate the microbial biomass of streams and lake sediments. \"Leptolyngbya frigida\" is dominant in benthic mats, and is frequently found in soils and as an epiphyte on mosses. \"Nostoc commune\" can develop to sizes visible to the naked eye if supplied with a thin water film. The genus \"Gloeocapsa\" is one of the few cryptoendolithic taxa with a high adaptation to extreme environmental conditions in rocks of the Dry Valleys. Actinobacteria such as \"Arthrobacter\" spp., \"Brevibacterium\" spp., and \"Corynebacterium\" spp. are prominent in the Dry Valleys. Thermophilic bacteria have been isolated from thermally heated soils near Mt. Melbourne and Mt. Rittman in northern Victoria Land. Bacteria genera found in both air samples and the Antarctic include \"Staphylococcus\", \"Bacillus\", \"Corynebacterium\", \"Micrococcus\", \"Streptococcus\", \"Neisseria\", and \"Pseudomonas\".\n\nBacteria species identified in recent research:\n\n\"Chaetomium gracile\" is frequently isolated from geothermally heated soil on Mt. Melbourne in northern Victoria Land. Fungi genera found in both air samples and the Antarctic include \"Penicillium\", \"Aspergillus\", \"Cladosporium\", \"Alternaria\", \"Aureobasidium\", \"Botryotrichum\", \"Botrytis\", \"Geotrichum\", \"Staphylotrichum\", \"Paecilomyces\", and \"Rhizopus\".\n\nFungi species identified in recent research:\n\nMacrolichens (e.g., \"Usnea sphacelata\", \"U. antarctica\", \"Umbilicaria decussate\", and \"U. aprina\") and communities of weakly or non-nitrophilous lichens (e.g., \"Pseudephebe minuscula\", \"Rhizocarpon superficial\", and \"R. geographicum\", and several species of \"Acarospora\" and \"Buellia\") are relatively widespread in coastal ice-free areas. Sites with substrates influenced by seabirds are colonized by well-developed communities of nitrophilous lichen species such as \"Caloplaca athallina\", \"C. citrina\", \"Candelariella flava\", \"Lecanora expectans\", \"Physcia caesia\", \"Rhizoplaca melanophthalma\", \"Xanthoria elegans\", and \"X. mawsonii\". In the Dry Valleys the normally epilithic lichen species (\"Acarospora gwynnii\", \"Buellia frigida\", \"B. grisea\", \"B. pallida\", \"Carbonea vorticosa\", \"Lecanora fuscobrunnea\", \"L. cancriformis\", and \"Lecidella siplei\") are found primarily in protected niches beneath the rock surface occupying a cryptoendolithic ecological niche. \nLichen species identified in recent research:\nYeast species identified in recent research:\n\nThe moss species \"Campylopus pyriformis\" is restricted to geothermal sites.\n\nMoss species identified in recent research:\n\nThe small amoebae are of two types.

{"id": "19421270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19421270", "title": "Private healthcare", "text": "Private healthcare\n\nPrivate healthcare or private medicine is healthcare and medicine provided by entities other than the government. \n\nEthical issues relating to private healthcare primarily concerns the argument that the seriously ill be entitled to spend money on saving their lives. On the other hand, private healthcare can sometimes be more efficient than public sector provision. Private operators may be more innovative in areas such as telemedicine. Due to the profit motive, they can be more productive. The friendly behavior of staff and doctors are the main reason for people relying on private health care centers.\n\nEuropeans in all countries are willing to pay a charge for some private healthcare, whether to avoid long queues, to access cosmetic surgery, or to avoid the perceived risk of infection in public-sector hospitals. This is not a small market. In Finland, it is estimated that it is worth some €700m a year. In Greece, half the income of private hospitals is from one-off payments from patients. Maternity is a particularly large private market, as it is the demand for fertility both at home and abroad, where more than 18% of medical internet-based searches are related to infertility conditions and treatment. Healthcare tourism is also thriving within the EU, in which patients (mainly from the UK) travel to Eastern Europe for low-cost dental work. The particularly wealthy Russians and Saudi Arabians tend to go to private hospitals in Switzerland or Germany.\n\nAs most Europeans have access to public sector provision either through their mandatory social insurance fund or through taxes, private healthcare insurance remains a relatively small market, with levels typically in the range of 2–8% of the population . Many consumers prefer to pay single fees as and when necessary. In addition, any occupational healthcare paid for by employers renders private healthcare insurance unnecessary. Nonetheless, around 10% of Germans have some form of private healthcare insurance which enables them to experience a slightly higher level of comfort during hospital stays. The most notable development in this area has been the Netherlands, which in 2005 moved to a system whereby all citizens are forced to take out private healthcare insurance rather than social insurance. This is being closely monitored by many European countries.\n\nIn many European countries with a state-run national health service, employers are obliged to pay for some level of healthcare for their employees. This is the case in Romania, Poland, and Finland, for instance, and one can find networks of small clinics in large cities in these countries. In other countries, such as the UK and Sweden, many employers are willing to pay for occupational healthcare for their workforce so that key workers can avoid delays in seeing a doctor when they are unwell. Naturally, though, the occupational health department of a publicly funded hospital will provide a similar standard of healthcare to that provided for patients.\n"}

{"id": "1255964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1255964", "title": "Rugby Radio Station", "text": "Rugby Radio Station\n\nRugby Radio Station was a large radio transmission facility at Hillmorton near the town of Rugby, Warwickshire in England, situated just west of the A5 trunk road and in later years junction 18 of the M1 motorway. Part of the site was on the other side of the A5, across the border in Northamptonshire. First opened in 1926, at its height in the 1950s it was the largest radio transmitting station in the world, with a total of 57 radio transmitters, covering an area of 1600 acres. Traffic slowly dwindled from the 1980s onwards, and the site was closed between 2003 and 2007.\nFollowing the end of the First World War the British government set about implementing plans for an Imperial Wireless Chain to link the countries of the British Empire. It was decided that the new wireless service would be state-run by the Post Office. The site east of Hillmorton, was chosen in 1923. Part of the site had previously been occupied by RAF Lilbourne between 1915 and 1920.\n\nIts large very low frequency (VLF) transmitter came into service on 1 January 1926 and was originally used to transmit telegraph messages to the Commonwealth as part of the Imperial Wireless Chain. After the 1950s this transmitter, active as callsign GBR on 16.0 kHz, using Morse code and later on 15.975 kHz with frequency-shift keying FSK and minimum-shift keying MSK, was used for transmitting messages to submerged submarines. Criggion radio station acted as a reserve. The GBR transmitter was shut down on 1 April 2003 and was replaced by a new one at the Skelton transmitting station.\n\nIn 1927, a second transmitter was installed to initiate the first transatlantic commercial telephone service; linking New York and London on 60 kHz using single-sideband modulation. This transmitter was decommissioned in 1956 and became the time signal transmitter MSF. This new function developed from the decision, in 1951, to use the station to transmit modulated standard frequencies for scientific reference purposes. In 1972 these transmissions were consolidated onto the present frequency of 60 kHz and a further reference, that of a time signal, was added. In 1977 this took the form of the rolling \"slow code\" in use until April 2007, when BT's contract to transmit the time signal also passed to VT Communications, using their Anthorn radio station in Cumbria.\n\nThe aerial system at the VLF transmitter existed between 1926 and 2004 and consisted of twelve 250 metre (820 ft) high, guyed steel-framework masts insulated against ground and carrying an aerial wire. This wire was mainly destroyed by heavy iceloads in the winter of 1940. After the shutdown of GBR, the facility was only used for transmitting the MSF time signal. Therefore, eight of the twelve masts were obsolete and demolished on the night of 19 June 2004 to 20 June 2004.\n\nThe remaining four 'tall' masts were demolished on 2 August 2007. Most of the majority of the smaller masts still stand awaiting demolition before becoming an industrial estate \n\nA trial transmission of the LORAN-C navigation system was run at the station from June 2005 until March 2007.\n\n\n"}

Clovis sent messengers to assess the treasure, who then asked Chlodoric to plunge his hand as deeply into his gold coins as possible. With his arm submerged, the envoys of Clovis then killed the new king in betrayal. Clovis then stood before the people of Chlodoric and told them that the son had sent assassins to murder his father, but that Chlodoric had subsequently met his own end as well. Clovis then offered his protection to the former subjects of Sigobert and Chlodoric, and thus became their king.\n\nGregory suggests that Chlodoric was murdered in the same campaign that killed the Frankish King Chararic. Before, Clovis had killed Ragnachar and his brothers.\n\nAfter all these murders, Gregory tells us that Clovis lamented that he had no family left, implying that among his own casualties were close relatives.\n\n"}
