The event is commemorated on the Monegasque coat of arms, on which the supporters are two monks armed with swords. He held the citadel of Monaco for four years before being chased out by the Genoese. The battle over \"the rock\" was taken over by his kinsmen. Francesco thus failed to establish Grimaldi's rule over Monaco, but was the first to attempt to do so.\n\nHe was married in 1295 to Aurelia del Carretto; the marriage was childless. The modern Grimaldis are therefore not descendants of Francesco. After his death, in 1309, he was succeeded by his cousin (and stepson), Rainier I, Lord of Cagnes.\n\nHis cousin's descendants, the Grimaldi family, still rule Monaco today.

He was the first man to travel over 100 miles per hour on water.\n\nGar Wood was born on December 4, 1880 in Mapleton, Iowa, into a family of 13 children. His father was a ferryboat operator on Lake Osakis, Minnesota, and Gar worked on boats from an early age. In 1911, at age 31, he invented a hydraulic lift for unloading coal from rail trucks.\n\nHe established the Wood Hoist Co. in Detroit, Michigan, and soon became a successful businessman. Later, he changed the company's name to Garwood Industries, which built racing and pleasure boats under the \"Gar Wood\" brand, but also capitalized on experience with coal unloaders to successfully produce and market GarWood truck, bus and coach bodies. He had a home in Algonac, Michigan, the same city as Christopher Smith, founder of Chris-Craft boats.\n\nIn 1916, Wood purchased a motorboat for racing called \"Miss Detroit\". Wood set a new water speed record of in 1920 on the Detroit River, using a new boat called \"Miss America\". In the following twelve years, Wood built nine more \"Miss Americas\" and broke the record five times, raising it to in 1932 on the St. Clair River.\n\nIn 1921, Wood raced one of his boats against the Havana Special train, up the Atlantic coast from Miami to New York City. Wood made the trip in 47 hours and 23 minutes and beat the train by 12 minutes. In 1925, he raced the Twentieth Century Limited train up the Hudson River between Albany and New York and won by 22 minutes.\n\nAs well as being a record breaker and showman, Wood won five straight powerboat Gold Cup races between 1917 and 1921. Wood also won the prestigious Harmsworth Trophy nine times (1920–21, 1926, 1928–30, 1932–33).\n\nIn 1931, he lost the Trophy in dramatic circumstances to his younger brother George. The race was held on the Detroit River and was billed as a match race between the Wood brothers and English (sic) racing driver and record-breaker Kaye Don, driving \"Miss England II\". Before an estimated crowd of over a million spectators (one of the largest crowds for a sporting event ever), Don won the first heat of the race. In the second heat, Wood was leading Don, when \"Miss England II\" suddenly flipped over rounding one of the turns, fortunately without injury to Don and his co-driver. Gar Wood finished the race first, but both he and Don were disqualified because they had jumped the starter's gun by seven seconds. George Wood completed the final race to win the trophy.\n\nIn April, 1936, Wood, along with many other sports champions and stand outs, was honored at a banquet in Detroit, MI. This banquet was the first celebration of Champions Day.\n\nIn July, 1936, a plaque was presented to Detroit from the White House honoring Detroit as the City of Champions. The plaque has five \"medallions\" featuring athletes. One of these medallions is of a power boat racer, representing Wood.\n\nWood retired from racing in 1933 to concentrate on his businesses. Garwood Industries continued to build wooden racing and pleasure boats until 1947 under the \"Gar Wood\" brand. Boats were sized between 16ft and 33ft in length; the most famous models were the 16ft Gar Wood Speedster (built from 1934 to 1938) and the exclusive 33’ Baby Gar gentleman’s racer (built in the 1920s and early 1930s). Garwood Industries also built truck bodies and winches that were used extensively by truck manufacturers such as International Harvester, and were an OEM supplier to both the civilian and military market. Many trucks built during World War II came equipped with Garwood bodies and winches. One of the biggest contributions by Garwood Industries was the development of the now-ubiquitous garbage truck, which was originally built and sold under the name Garwood Load Packer.\n\nWood was known as an inventive genius who, at one point, held more US patents than any other living American.\n\nIn 1897, at age 17, he invented a downdraft carburetor which enabled his inspection boat to outrace the other inspectors.\n\nIn 1911 or 1912 he invented the profitable hydraulic hoist for dump trucks. He used the money It earned to build racing boats which won many championships between 1917 and 1933.\n\nAt one point he had a job selling lightning rods to farmers, and to demonstrate their effectiveness he invented an induction coil device to mimic lightning.\n\nIn the 1950s, Wood acquired Fisher Island in South Florida's Biscayne Bay, the last of a series of millionaires to occupy it as a one-family island retreat. He sold it to a development group in 1963. Wood also had a summer retreat in McGregor Bay, Ontario.\n\nA 1967 Popular Mechanics article showed even in retirement Wood was still active inventing an Electric Vehicle (EV) controller, which he used in the EV he built.\n\nWood died in Miami 16 Jun 1971, at age 90 and days before the 50th anniversary of his first Harmsworth win. Upon his death, George Van of The Detroit News wrote: \"“To the public, he was Tom Swift, Jules Verne, Frank Merriwell with a little bit of Horatio Alger thrown in.”\" Wood was buried near his home in Algonac, Michigan.\n\nHe was inducted in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1990.\n\n"}

It was created by royal decree on 26 June 1817 by King William I of the Netherlands. The decree describes the following: \"Erepenning voor blijken van belangstelling in 's Rijksverzamelingen door schenking betoond\" (). The medal is awarded in gold, silver or bronze as a token of appreciation to those who \"aan hen, die enig boek- of kunstwerk, dat de vrucht van hun arbeid was, de Koning deden toekomen\" ().\n\nBy royal decree, on 5 May 1877, eligibility for this award was extended by King William III of the Netherlands, with the description \"aan hen, die door het aanbieden van belangrijke geschenken of op andere wijze zich verdienstelijk hebben gemaakt ten opzichte van de verschillende wetenschappelijke en kunstverzamelingen des Rijks\" (). Due to this description, the medal obtained its current official name. However, since the end of the 19th century, this decoration is primarily known as the \"Museum Medal\". Up until 1897, the honorary medal was only a standing decoration, when Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands declared that the medal could be worn suspended from a ribbon.\n\nEligibility for this award was once again extending, by Queen Wilhelmina, on 28 October 1919 with the description \"verdiensten jegens gemeentelijke (openbare) verzamelingen\" (English: merit towards community (public) collections). What was initially a medal for generous donors became now an official royal award for merit. Queen Juliana of the Netherlands decided by royal decree on 26 July 1952 that the shape of the medal and ribbon should be changed. The current ribbon is orange with two red lines descending down the middle. A ribbon bar is also given with the award, with a palm branch device in either gold or silver for recipients of the gold or silver versions of the medal, respectively.

Lanun means pirate in Malay language. Originally from the Sultanate of Maguindanao, in southern Mindanao, Iranun colonies spread throughout Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago and the north and east coast of Borneo. Most Iranuns are Muslim. Their language is part of the Austronesian family, and is most closely related to the Maranao people of Lanao. Historically, the Iranun were given the exonym Illanun during the British colonial era. The Malay term \"Lanun\" or pirate originated from the exonym.\nIn the case of inter-marriages of an Iranun woman and an outsider man, the cultural influences of the woman's family will be more dominant that the outsider man would be considered as an Iranun man; although in a lot cases this does not happen.\n\nThe language of the Maranao and Maguindanao is strongly rooted in the Iranun tongue. The Iranun may perhaps be the mother language and the rest are just a mere dialects. For several centuries, the Iranuns in the Philippines formed part of the Sultanate of Maguindanao. In the past, the seat of the Maguindanao Sultanate was situated at Lamitan and Malabang. Both of which were the strongholds of the Iranun society. Iranuns fought the Western invaders under the flag of the Maguindanao Sultanate. They formed part of the Moro resistance against the USA occupation of the Philippines from 1899 to 1913. The Iranun were excellent in maritime activity as they are traditionally sailors and pirates. They used to ply the route connecting the Sulu Sea, Moro Gulf to Celebes Sea, and raided the Spanish held territories along the way.\n\n"}

The novel was made into a film of the same name in 1975. Set against the discussions between the patrons of a café in Cairo, the \"Karnak Café\", the book follows the stories of three individuals during the 1960s, including the Six-Day War (1967) and the War of Attrition (1967–70). It therein explores some of the political currents vying for control over Egyptian politics in the 1960s as well as political persecution, the deep state, and state violence.\n\nThe narrator begins the story by describing how he originally discovered the \"Karnak Café\" in Cairo, attracted by the quiet charms of Qurunfula, a bellydancer of former fame and the café's owner. There, the narrator quickly becomes part of the café's regular crowd of patrons, which represent a cross-section of Egyptian society during the early 1960s. Among many others, the crowd includes the following young people: Hilmi Hamada, an idealistic communist with whom Qurunfula has a discreet love affair; Isma'il al-Shaykh, a law graduate of modest origins; and Zaynab Diyab, another graduate from a poor background. Throughout the story, the youth are repeatedly arrested and imprisoned for prolonged periods; a mirror to Qurunfula's despair, the narrator keeps track how the youths' initial political enthusiasm and optimism slowly gives place to disillusion and hopelessness. After their third prison term, the café learns that Hilmi Hamada has died in prison, leaving Qurunfula distraught. As Isma'il and Zaynab open up to the narrator, he learns of the horrors Isma'il and Zaynab endured in prison – Isma'il is repeatedly tortured while Zaynab is raped – and how the ruthless and brutal police officer Khalid Sawfan turned both Isma'il and Zaynab into informants for the secret police after their second term in prison. As Hilmi tries to convince Isma'il and Zaynab of the necessity of communism, he is betrayed by Zaynab, who tries to thereby keep Isma'il safe, and is beaten to death in prison. The defeat of the Egyptian army during the Six-Day War sees Isma'il, who was imprisoned in spite of Zaynab's assistance, and a reversal of fortunes: after being thrown into prison and having become disabled through torture, Sawfan joins the regular crowd of the Karnak Café, painting himself both as a criminal and a victim and gaining the patrons' appreciation through witty political commentary. The novel ends on a hopeful note with Qurunfula setting her eyes upon Munir Ahmad, a new idealistic and innocent youth: for purity and innocence never disappear forever.\n\n"}

Established on 1 April 2015, it replaced the former Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), following the Parker Review of the operations of ACPO.\n\nThe NPCC was established on 1 April 2015 as the replacement organisation of the Association of Chief Police Officers.\n\nIn 2010, the Cameron Government announced a series of police reforms including local accountability through Police and Crime Commissioners, and the creation of the National Crime Agency and the College of Policing. In 2013, the PCCs commissioned General Sir Nick Parker to review the services that ACPO provided and make recommendations about the requirements of a national policing body following the fundamental changes in policing. In 2014, a group of chief officers and PCCs began working together to implement Parker's recommendations and develop a national body. Chief officers voted in support of the group's proposals in July 2014. Chief Constable Sara Thornton was appointed to chair the NPCC on 2 December 2014. ACPO was closed down on 31 March 2015.\n\nIn October 2018 the NPCC threatened to take legal action in the high court against the government's plans to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from police funding.

It is hosted by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) but acts independently.\n\nThe NPCC brings together and is funded by police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as the armed services and some British overseas territories. It draws on the efforts and expertise of chief officers: those ranked Assistant Chief Constable and above, or Commander and above in MPS and City of London Police, and senior police staff equivalents. It coordinates police forces' collective operational responses to national threats such as terrorism, organised crime and national emergencies.\n\nThe current chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council is Sara Thornton, CBE, QPM, formerly Chief Constable of the Thames Valley Police. Chief Constable of Sussex Police Giles York and MPS Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt support her as Vice-chairs in addition to their day jobs as chief officers within forces.\n\nThe Chief Constables' Council is the senior operational decision-making body for the National Police Chiefs' Council. Every police force is represented in the work of the NPCC through the Chief Constables' Council.\n\nThe Chief Constables’ Council is the primary decision-making forum for the NPCC. Chief constables (and equivalents) meet quarterly to discuss operational policing issues and agree action. Working with the College of Policing, the council takes decisions on national standards and common approaches with the aim of protecting the public from the most serious and strategic threats.\n\nIn addition to their day jobs, chief officers support the NPCC's work by providing national operational perspectives on particular crime and policing issues.
