{"id": "2647177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2647177", "title": "Balkan Federation", "text": "Balkan Federation\n\nThe Balkan Federation project was a left-wing political movement to create a \"Balkan federation\".\n\nThe concept of a Balkan federation emerged in the late 19th century from among left political forces in the region. The central aim was to establish a new political unity: a common federal republic unifying the Balkan Peninsula on the basis of internationalism, socialism, social solidarity, and economic equality. The underlying vision was that despite differences among the Balkan peoples the historical need for emancipation was a common basis for unification.\n\nThis political concept went through three phases in its development. In the first phase the idea was articulated as a response to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 20th century. In the second phase, mostly through the interwar period (1919–36), the idea of the Balkan federation was taken up by the Balkan Communist parties. The third phase is characterized by the clash between the Balkan Communist leaders and Joseph Stalin, who opposed the idea during the post-World War II period.\n\nAt first, in Belgrade in 1865 a number of radical Balkan intellectuals founded the Democratic Oriental Federation, proposing a federation from the Alps to Cyprus based on political freedom and social equality. They confirmed their adherence to the ideals of French Revolution in the line of Saint-Simon's federalism and in relation to the socialist ideas of Karl Marx or Mikhail Bakunin. Later, in France, a League for the Balkan Confederation, was constituted in 1894, in which Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian, and Romanian socialists participated, supporting Macedonian autonomy inside the general federation of Southeast Europe, as an attempt to deal with the complexity of the Macedonian Question. The next attempt came immediately after the Young Turk Revolution in 1908. The following year, in Salonika, the Socialist Workers Association merged with two Bulgarian socialist groups, and the Socialist Worker's Federation of Ottoman Workers was founded. This group underestimated, till 1913, the political significance of nationalism, as this significance manifested itself in the right of national self-determination. Its leadership kept a moderate position in regard with the nationalistic tendencies in Balkan social democratic parties.\n\nThe movement for Balkan Socialist Federation arose after the Young Turk Revolution in 1908. The First Balkan Socialist Conference was held on January 7-9, 1910 in Belgrade. The main platforms at this conference were Balkan unity and action against the impending wars. Another important aspect was the call for a solution to the Macedonian Question. In 1915, after a conference in Bucharest, it was decided to create a Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labour Federation, comprising groups which adhered to the Zimmerwald Conference and opposed participation in World War I. Initially headed by Christian Rakovsky, it had Vasil Kolarov and Georgi Dimitrov among its prominent activists. In 1915, Dimitrov wrote that Macedonia, \"... which was split into three parts ...\", would be, \"... reunited into a single state enjoying equal rights within the framework of the Balkan Democratic Federation.\" This independent and united Macedonia would have consisted of the corresponding geographical departments of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece. The leaders of the Federation were repressed by the Balkan governments at different intervals. Rakovsky was expelled from various Balkan countries and, during World War I, became a founding member of the Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labor Federation. Later he made his way to Russia, where he joined the Bolshevik Party after the October Revolution in 1917, and subsequently Dimitrov, Kolarov, and Rakovsky became members of the Comintern.\n\nAfter the Russian October Revolution, a Balkan Communist Federation was formed in 1920–1921, and was influenced by Vladimir Lenin's views on nationality (\"see Proletarian internationalism\"). It was a Communist umbrella organisation in which all the Communist parties in the Balkans were represented. It was dominated by the requirements imposed by the Soviet Union through the Comintern. It advocated a \"Balkan Federative Republic\" that would have included Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey; some projects also involved Romania, but most of them only envisaged its fragmentation. The body thus oversaw the activities of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BKP), the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ), the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), the Communist Party of Turkey (TKP), and, to a certain measure, those of the Communist Party of Romania (PCdR). It was disestablished in 1939.\n\nIn Sofia, Bulgaria, May–June 1922, the question of the \"autonomy of Macedonia, Dobruja and Thrace\" was raised by Vasil Kolarov and was backed by Dimitrov, the Bulgarian delegate who presided over the meeting. The Greek delegate asked for a postponement as he was reluctant to approve a motion that was not on the agenda. In December 1923, the Balkan Communist Federation held its Fifth Conference in Moscow. In 1924 the Comintern entered negotiations about collaboration between the Communists and the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation (ITRO) and Internal Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation (IDRO), and the creation of a united revolutionary movement. The idea for a new unified organization was supported by the Soviet Union, which saw a chance for using this well developed revolutionary movements to spread revolution in the Balkans and destabilize the Balkan monarchies.\n\nThe so-called May Manifesto of 6 May 1924 was issued in which the objectives of the unified Macedonian liberation movement were presented: independence and unification of partitioned Macedonia, fighting all the neighbouring Balkan monarchies, forming a Balkan Communist Federation and cooperation with the Soviet Union. In 1925, under the influence of the BKP, several left-wing splinter groups (the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United), the Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation and the Internal Thracian Organization), respectively, seceded from the main organizations. These wings militated for their own Soviet Republics, which would be part of a \"Balkan Communist Federation\". The BKP was compelled by Stalin to endorse the formation of Macedonian, Thracian, and Dobrujan nations in order to include those new separate states in the Balkan Communist Federation.\n\nThe KKE delegate Nikolaos Sargologos signed the motion without central authorisation; instead of returning to Athens, he emigrated to the United States. The KKE political organ and newspaper, \"Rizospastis\", was against the motion because it saw it as good for the BKP in Bulgaria but disastrous for the KKE in Greece. The KKE found the BCF's position on Macedonia difficult but briefly went along with it. In June 1924, at its 5th meeting, it recognised \"the Macedonian people\" and in December 1924, it endorsed the motion for \"a united and independent Macedonia and a united and independent Thrace\" with the perspective of entering into a union within a Balkan federation \"against the national and social yoke of the Greek and Bulgarian bourgeoisie\".\n\nHowever, the KKE suffered a crushing defeat it the 1928 Greek elections, especially in Greek Macedonia. Dissentions within the KKE had already made the motion untenable by 1927, and in March, the KKE conference watered it down, calling for autodetermination of the Macedonians until they join a \"Balkan Soviet Socialist Federation\" and only for \"a section of Macedonia (Florina area) inhabited by Slavomacedonians\" By 1935, it simply called for \"equal rights to all\" due to the \"change of the national composition of the Greek part of Macedonia\" and hence because \"the Leninist–Stalinist principle of self-determination demands the substitution of the old slogan\". The KPJ had its own problems and dissentions; fears of Serbianisation of the party and of the Vardar Banovina, whose inhabitants felt closer (though not necessarily identified) to Bulgaria than the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The KPJ followed the KKE example in 1936. In 1936 the left wings of the IMRO, ITRO, and IDRO were incorporated by regional principle into the Balkan Communist Parties.\n\nIn Albania, Communist ideas were mainly infiltrated by adjacent countries. Despite the effort of the Comintern to establish a Communist Party by sending and supporting emissaries as Kosta Boshnjaku and Ali Kelmendi later, Communist groups were not well organized, and they were weak. The Communist Party would be established only in 1941. Nevertheless, the contacts of the Albanians with Comintern were set way before. The Paris Peace Conference had fixed the borders of Albania as defined pre-World War I by the London Conference of 1912–13, leaving substantial Albanian-populated areas outside of its borders. At the same time, the country was dominated by during the early 1920s by an Ottoman ruling class with no intention of addressing the country's sharp topics, including an agrarian reform and the fate of the Albanians left outside the borders.\n\nIn the early 1920s, two entities came in contact with the Comintern: the left-wing opposition led by Bishop Fan Noli, and the Committee of Kosovo. Bajram Curri, a Kosovar Albanian and key person of both, said in December 1921 to the Soviet minister in Vienna that \"the Albanian people await impatiently the determination of their frontiers not on the basis of brutal and bloody historical considerations, but rather on the basis of the situation which actually exists today. With the firm conviction that Soviet Russia will be able in the near future to determine the boundaries of Europe, especially in the Balkans, in a just manner, I pray that the great Soviet government will grant our just requests at that time.\"\n\nAfter the failed June Revolution, Noli and others settled in Vienna where they formed KONARE (Revolutionary National Committee), a left-wing revolutionary committee openly pro-Soviet. Though KONARE, but even by themselves, the Committee of Kosovo would join the Balkan Federation and receive financial support. They would cooperate with IMRO revolutionaries as Todor Aleksandrov and Petar Chaulev. By 1928, KONARE came de facto under the control of the Comintern; 24 young Albanians were sent to Moscow to study in Soviet institutions. But by the early 1930s, the defense of Yugoslavia became an official Communist line. This way any support for the Committee of Kosovo faded. The introduction of Fascist Italy's interests in the equation completely disrupted any connection between Albanian nationalist-irredentist movements and the Comintern. KONARE would also dissolve in the mid-1930s, leaving the Comintern with few scattered communists groups within Albania.\n\nFor a short period during the Cominform, the Yugoslav and Bulgarian Communist leaders Josip Broz Tito and Georgi Dimitrov worked on a project to merge their two countries into a Balkan Federative Republic. As a concession to the Yugoslavian side, Bulgarian authorities agreed to the recognition of a distinct Macedonian ethnicity and language in part of their own population in the Bulgarian part of geographical Macedonia. This was one of the conditions of the Bled Agreement, signed between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria on 1 August 1947. In November 1947, pressured by both the Yugoslavs and the Soviets, Bulgaria also signed a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia. The Bulgarian president Georgi Dimitrov was sympathetic to the Macedonian Question. The Bulgarian Communist party was compelled once again to adapt its stand to Soviet interests in the Balkans. The policies resulting from the agreement were reversed after the Tito–Stalin split in June 1948, when Bulgaria, being subordinated to Soviet interests, was forced to take a stance against Yugoslavia.\n\n\n\n"}

Gozo boats were the main means of transport across the Gozo Channel between Gozo and the main island of Malta from at least 1241 to the 1960s.\n\nGozo boats evolved from the speronara (), which was found all over the Mediterranean Sea. The oldest records of a transport link between Gozo and Malta date back to 1241, when the boat was known as a \"dgħajsa tal-mogħdija\" or \"tal-pass\". By the 16th century, Gozo boats took the shape of a brigantine. In the 1880s, many Gozo boats changed their sail arrangements to a settee rig. In 1919, engines began to be installed on some Gozo boats, although many still retained their sails.\n\nMost Gozo boats were built at Kalkara in the Grand Harbour. The Caruana family, who were the last builders of Gozo boats, moved from there to Mġarr on Gozo in 1940. After 1959, a few Gozo boats were built in Gela, Sicily. The last one to be built was the \"Santa Rita\" (G48) in 1963.\n\nGozo boats usually made trips from the Grand Harbour in Malta to Mġarr Harbour on Gozo. Other trips were made from the Grand Harbour to Mellieħa or to Marfa, or Mġarr to Marfa or St. Paul's Bay. The boats carried both passengers and cargo between the two islands. Trips from Gozo to Malta were generally loaded with agricultural products such as fruit, vegetables, eggs and poultry, while return trips from Malta to Gozo were loaded with manufactured goods such as cement, soft drinks and beer.\n\nGozo boats were painted in shades of green, blue, red and yellow, similar to the traditional \"luzzu\". One boat was painted black to carry corpses between the islands.\n\nThere were a number of accidents involving Gozo boats. Some were hit by rifle fire while passing the Pembroke Rifle Ranges, although the authorities warned the boats' masters in advance. In 1900, a Gozo boat used that was being used for \"lampuki\" fishing capsized, killing one fisherman. Another boat lost her masts in 1911, but it managed to enter St. George's Bay. In 1926, an unoccupied Gozo boat was found adrift in rough seas. In rare cases, they were involved in collisions with tugboats or pinnaces.\n\nIn World War II, the boat \"Stella Maris\" was destroyed by enemy action.\n\nBy the 1960s and 1970s, regular steamer services began to compete with the Gozo boats, which were no longer suitable for the changing socio-economic situation. The remaining boats were converted into fishing boats, or were abandoned at Mġarr Harbour.\n\nSince 1979, the Gozo ferry service has been operated by Gozo Channel Company Limited, which now uses modern RORO ferries.\n\nVery few Gozo boats still survive today. One of these is the \"Sacra Famiglia\" (G32), which was built in Kalkara in 1933. It had become unseaworthy by the 1970s, and was beached at Mġarr. The hulk was eventually purchased by a private individual who wanted to sell it to the Ministry for Gozo. It was then purchased by the Gozo Channel Company Limited, who handed it to Wirt Għawdex and sponsored its restoration. After the boat was restored by the Caruana brothers (the sons of its original builder), it was placed on permanent display at the Żewwieqa promenade in 2014.\n\nAnother surviving Gozo boat is the \"Maryanne\", which was built in Gela in 1960. The boat remained in Gozo until February 1983, when it was purchased by Captain Morgan Cruises. The boat still belongs to Captain Morgan, and it is used for cruises around Marsamxett and the Grand Harbour. \"Maryanne\" is in good condition, but it no longer has the distinctive masts and a deck has been added.\n\nAnother two or three Gozo boats which were converted into fishing boats might still exist.\n\nThe Gozo boat has become a symbol of the island of Gozo, and a boat sailing on rough waters is featured on the flag and coat of arms of the village of Qala. Gozo boats are also found in the logos of various Gozitan organizations, such as the Gozo Philatelic Society and the Imperial Gozo Yacht Club.\n\nThe classical 1970s song \"Id-Dgħajsa tal-Latini\" by the Maltese band New Cuorey is about a Gozo boat.\n\n"}

In 1989 she undertook a fellowship for 6 months (IAESTE and DAAD) at the Alfred-Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, participating in the international European “Polarstern” Study (EPOS). She then began her PhD in 1992 as a National Council of the Research (CONICET) fellow in biological oceanography. Throughout her PhD she studied phytoplankton dynamics in coastal Antarctica. She received her PhD degree from the University of Buenos Aires in 1997. Between 2005 and 2007, she was a post-doctoral fellow at ISMER, where she studied the dynamics of phytoplankton and physical – biological coupling in the Beaufort Sea (Canadian Arctic).\n\nSchloss is a researcher at the Argentinian Antarctic Institute (IAA) and is a Correspondent Researcher of the National Council of the Research (CONICET) of Argentina. She has been an associate professor at UQAR since 2009, and was a research assistant there since 2008. Her research focusses on the impact of UVB radiation on plankton communities at a range of latitudes, the role of phytoplankton on CO fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere and the effects of global change on coastal plankton. She has research expertise in the dynamics of high latitude marine plankton and variations of plankton communities in space and time. Schloss has participated in nine expeditions to Antarctica (ship-based and on Argentinean stations), spending around 17 months in the sixth continent.\n\nHer greatest impact has been in research on the interactions the adaptation and effects of plankton to ocean climate change. Her work has modelled physical-biological interactions during bloom dynamics in coastal Antarctica, in particular the equilibrium between warming, glacier melt water and wind-induced physical turbulence in coastal waters. Her work on the role of plankton groups on CO dynamics indicated that diatoms are key contributors to atmospheric CO uptake in surface waters, providing a direct link between biodiversity and climate-relevant processes. Additionally, her work demonstrated links between large-scale atmospheric phenomena (e.g. Southern Annular Mode and El Niño Southern Oscillation) and local phytoplankton dynamics.\n\nSchloss plays a central role in the development of international collaborations in Antarctic research. She has been successful in working in polar science in different countries, such as Argentina, Canada, and Germany through the promotion and participation in numerous international research projects and initiatives, cooperating with researchers from USA, Spain, Belgium, Brazil, Poland, and the UK. She further participates in the development of the Antarctic Environmental Portal. She is particularly involved in the promotion of Antarctic science.

It works in both the developed and developing world.\n\nMdM was formally established on 1 February 1980. Its goals were \"to go where others will not, to testify to the intolerable, and to volunteer\".\n\nIts origins lay in a 1979 intervention to assist a drifting boat of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea. Kouchner, with volunteer doctors, journalists, and others organized a hospital boat, L'Île de lumière, to provide medical care and to report the refugees' suffering.\n\nMdM was founded as Bernard Kouchner and 14 others doctors split from the group he previously founded, Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF, or Doctors Without Borders).

Following the 2016 Arctic Circle Assembly, it also introduced a new BRICS engagement forum.\n\nSince its inception, PRPI's most defining features have been the provision of research, analysis and commentary; high-level engagement with policymakers, industry leaders, academics and Indigenous representatives; ongoing dialogue with national governments and multilateral fora; and active participation at national and international conferences. It has also aligned its principal activities with the key priorities of the incumbent Chairs of the Arctic Council: the United States, 2015-2017, on \"improving economic and living conditions in Arctic communities\"; and Finland, 2017-2019, in \"exploring[ing] how the Agenda 2030 framework [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development] can be used in Arctic cooperation for the benefit of humans and nature\".\n\nPRPI publishes its research and provides analysis and commentary both via its digital platform Polar Connection (www.polarconnection.org) and through partner platforms such as Arctic Today and other national and international media outlets. PRPI Fellows also make their research available through monographs, book chapters in edited volumes and research papers in journals. Its research interests are reflected in its organisational structure, which features three divisions: theme-specific units; industry-specific units; and stakeholder engagement forums.\n\nPRPI has six theme-specific units:\n\nPRPI has six industry-specific units:\n\nPRPI engages with different geopolitical constituencies through five engagement forums: \n\nPRPI positions itself as the nexus between stakeholders in policy, industry, academia, civil society and the media, and it provides a platform for dialogue and cooperation between different stakeholders. It does so in a variety of ways:\n\nPRPI has regularly provided written and oral evidence to relevant UK Parliamentary inquiries, such as:\n\nPRPI also provides policy briefs and industry briefs, when requested, to policymakers and industry leaders.\n\nPRPI also sends missions or delegations to brief national governments and intergovernmental bodies about various Arctic, Nordic and Antarctic issues or the ongoing work of PRPI. In September 2016, its founder, Dr Dwayne Menezes, represented PRPI at the United Nations General Assembly and was invited to attend the UN Paris Climate Change Agreement Ratification Ceremony in New York City as a Civil Society Observer. In its early years, PRPI delegations were also received by the Executive Secretary of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat in Buenos Aires; the Executive Office of the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York; the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House, the United States Department of State, the International Monetary Fund and the National Science Foundation in Washington, D.C.; the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London; the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia) in Canberra; Global Affairs Canada, Senate of Canada and Government of Newfoundland and Labrador; the Prime Minister's Office (Finland) and Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland) in Helsinki; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark) in Copenhagen; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iceland) in Reykjavik; among others.\n\nWith respect to conferences, PRPI has sent delegations to, or convened policy dialogues at, the Arctic Circle Assemblies organised by Arctic Circle (organization) in Reykjavik in October 2015, October 2016 and October 2017; the Arctic Circle Forums hosted by the same organisation in Edinburgh in November 2017 and Tórshavn in May 2018; the Arctic Encounter Symposia held in the margins of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015 and in Seattle in April 2018; the Arctic Spirit Conference hosted in Rovaniemi in November 2017; the Ramboll Arctic Roundtable in Portland, Maine in December 2016; the NERC Arctic Science Conference convened in Sheffield in September 2015 and Antarctic Science Conference in Norfolk in July 2016; the Antarctica 100 Annual Meeting at the Royal Geographical Society in London in November 2015; the Arctic Future Symposium hosted by the International Polar Foundation in Brussels in November 2015; and the Arctic Science Summit Week and Arctic Observing Summit held in Fairbanks in April 2016 and Davos in June 2018.\n\nAnnually, PRPI hosts 50-60 events around the world, ranging from lectures, panel discussions, roundtable discussions, workshops, conferences, policy breakfasts and dinners, and receptions for visiting dignitaries.\n\nPRPI has been widely credited for ensuring the Sustainable Development Goals remain high on the policy agenda of Arctic Council member and observer governments, and for bringing about a re-articulation of the global Arctic discourse along the lines of the 17 Global Goals. It is particularly known for its high-level, multi-stakeholder dialogues on SDGs in the Arctic, which have been convened thus far at the Arctic Circle Assembly at Harpa (concert hall) in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 2017; Lapland University of Applied Sciences in Rovaniemi, Finland, in November 2017; Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, in December 2017; Australian Institute of International Affairs in Canberra, Australia, in January 2018; Palace of Westminster in London, United Kingdom, in February 2018; Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Boston, United States, in March 2018; Arctic Encounter Symposium in Seattle, United States, in April 2018; University of Tromsø in Tromsø, Norway, in April 2018; Arctic Circle Forum in Tórshavn, Faroe Islands, in May 2018; and Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India, in June 2018.\n\nIn June 2017, PRPI co-hosted a workshop on 'Regional Security in the North: Emerging Themes and Challenges' in Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, in collaboration with Trent University, Yukon College, Royal Military College of Canada, St. Jerome's University, the Consulate General of the United States in Toronto, Borders in Globalization and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. At the workshop, David Johnny, former chief of the White River First Nation, highlighted the challenges posed by borders to indigenous communities, such as the Upper Tanana peoples, whose villages and dwellings were near the boundary or even straddled the line. Likewise, Dr Dalee Sambo Dorough, professor at University of Alaska Anchorage and former chair of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, discussed the difficulties faced by American and Canadian Inuit.\n\nTwo months later, in August 2017, PRPI, along with University College London (UCL), Trent University and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, convened a follow-up interdisciplinary panel discussion on 'Arctic Borders Governance' at UCL in London, with Prof. Heather Nicol, Dr Ilan Kelman and Dr Dwayne Menezes as speakers. The discussion focused on the implications of borders on indigenous peoples in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions - particularly the Inuit in United States, Canada, Greenland and Russia; the Aleuts in Russia and the United States; the Gwich'in people in Canada and the United States; and the Sami people in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. These discussions also formed the basis of the paper on 'Canada, Indigenous Peoples and Northern Borders' that Menezes published in in October 2017.\n\nIn December 2017, on behalf of PRPI and Trent University, Menezes and Nicol chaired a panel discussion on Arctic borders at the European Union- and Canada-funded Borders in Globalization 2nd International Conference held at the Lord Elgin Hotel in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with Canadian Senator Charlie Watt, historian P. Whitney Lackenbauer, lawyer Robin Campbell and Université de Montréal professor Suzanne Lalonde as speakers.\n\nIn June 2016, PRPI Fellow and UCL Researcher Domagoj Baresic presented his research at the International Conference on 'Maritime Actors and Climate Change: Incentives and Strategies for Voluntary Action' organised by the Transatlantic Maritime Emissions Research Network (TRAMEREN), a joint research venture between the Center for Enterprise Liability, Faculty of Law, University of Copenhagen and the Frank Guarini Center, School of Law, New York University, held in Copenhagen, Denmark. Acknowledging the challenges involved with developing a comprehensive international legal framework for controlling maritime greenhouse gas emissions, the conference examined some of the innovative, yet decentralised, approaches for incentivising maritime emissions controls, paying attention to the fragmented legal architecture governing the sector.\n\nFollowing the adoption and implementation of a prohibition on the use and carriage of heavy fuel oil (HFO) by ships operating in the Antarctic, the Clean Arctic Alliance (CAA) has campaigned to establish similar environmental protection measures in the Arctic. In November 2017, PRPI joined forces with CAA in its efforts to introduce a HFO ban in the Arctic and co-hosted a panel discussion on 'Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) Use in Arctic Shipping: Risks, Alternatives and Legal Options for a Phase-Out' at the 10th Polar Law Symposium in Rovaniemi, Finland, with support from the European Climate Foundation. At the event, PRPI became a signatory to the Arctic Commitment. In January 2018, PRPI also published a report by Dr Sian Prior of CAA and Liana James of the Clean Air Task Force about the progress made at the International Maritime Organization on a phase-out of the use of HFO as marine fuel in the Arctic, wherein they also laid out some of the measures which could be implemented to mitigate the risks associated with HFO use and the legal options available to ban HFO use in the Arctic altogether. Baresic also discussed his ongoing research on 'Sustainability Transitions in Arctic Maritime Transport' at the Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavik in October 2017 and the Arctic Circle Forum in Edinburgh in November 2017.\n\nAlongside fuel use in Arctic shipping, the development of support infrastructure for safe, secure, effective and efficient Arctic transport has also been a research and policy priority for PRPI. In July 2017, PRPI organised a keynote lecture by PRPI Fisheries Head and University of Southern Denmark Professor Dr Brooks Kaiser on 'Arctic Ports: Local Community Development Issues' at Korea Polar Research Institute KOPRI in Incheon, South Korea. In November 2017, Baresic and Menezes also presented about Arctic maritime and coastal infrastructure at the 11th Arctic Shipping Summit in London. A number of subsequent PRPI 'SDGs in the Arctic' dialogues, such as those in Seattle and Tórshavn, also focused on Arctic transportation, with high-level speakers drawn from the Arctic Council, Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland), Alaska Airlines, Maine Port Authority, Maine Department of Transportation, United States Department of Transportation, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Homeland Security Centers of Excellence and the Danish Folketing. PRPI has also provided analysis and commentary on Arctic shipping to publications in the maritime domain.\n\nIn October 2017, PRPI and the Embassy of Canada in Iceland hosted a screening of the 2016 Canadian feature-length documentary film Angry Inuk at the 2017 Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavik, Iceland, followed by a Q&A session with the Inuk filmmaker Alethea Arnaquq-Baril. Canada's Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett, Canadian Ambassador to Iceland Dr Anne-Tamara Lorre and PRPI Director Dr Dwayne Menezes offered addresses, while Penny Goodman of Scott Polar Research Institute moderated the discussion with Arnaquq-Baril. The film presented a defence of the Inuit seal hunt in the face of the EU Ban on Seal Products. The film also set the stage for a panel discussion on 'Arctic Sealing: Threat or Blue Prospect?' convened the next day by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated in which Arnaquq-Baril and Menezes both sat on the panel. The panel also included NAMMCO General Secretary Genevieve Desportes, Makivik Corporation Vice-President Adamie Alaku, Aaja Chemnitz Larsen and Nordic Council senior adviser Geir Oddsson, among others.\n\nIn April 2017, PRPI Director Menezes visited Rovaniemi, Finland, where he highlighted the opportunities for trade and investment between the UK and the eight Arctic Council member states at Northern STARS, the annual international seminar of Lapin AMK - Lapland University of Applied Sciences. In October 2017, PRPI hosted a discussion on the same topic at the 2017 Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\nLikewise, early in July 2017, in order to mark the 150th anniversary of Canada, PRPI convened a special 'Canada 150' lecture and reception with Canadian historian Ken Coates of the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, University of Saskatchewan, at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London. Later that year, in October 2017, PRPI hosted two keynote lectures by Tony Penikett, former Premier of Yukon, on 'Indigenous Chiefs, Regional Legislators, and Nation States: Who Rules the Arctic?' in the UK, the first with University College London (UCL) in London and the second with the University of Edinburgh in Edinburgh. In November 2017, PRPI and the Department of Political Science at University of Western Ontario (UWO or Western University) convened two keynote lectures by Elizabeth Riddell Dixon in London, Ontario, Canada, the first on 'Ice Camps and Icebreakers: The Challenges of Mapping the Arctic Seabed' at London Public Library and the second on 'Sovereignty and Canada's Arctic Extended Continental Shelf' at UWO.\n\nIn January 2018, PRPI hosted a keynote lecture by American publisher and philanthropist Alice Rogoff on 'The US and its Emerging Arctic Interest' at UCL in London, UK.\n\nIn 2016, PRPI Geopolitics and Security Fellow Barbora Padrtova was part of a research team that supported the preparation of an Arctic Analysis Research Report at the behest of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic). She discussed her work in this regard at the 2016 General Conference of the European Consortium for Political Research held at Charles University in Prague in July 2016, the Annual Meeting of the Austrian Polar Research Institute in Vienna in November 2016 and an Expert Seminar on 'The Arctic: Emerging Importance of the Region for the Czech Republic' held at the Institute of International Relations Prague in Prague in January 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, PRPI convened a keynote lecture by PRPI Fisheries Fellow Brooks Kaiser on 'A Case for the Commons: The Snow Crab in the Barents' at Korea Polar Research Institute KOPRI in Incheon, South Korea. In September 2017, PRPI Fellow Nic Craig presented on the 'Implications of Brexit on UK - Arctic Interconnection and the Continued Need for Cooperation' at the 2017 Arctic Energy Summit in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nIn October 2017, PRPI joined University College London in hosting a keynote lecture by Timo Koivurova of Arctic Centre, University of Lapland on 'How Finland, as Chair of the Arctic Council, aims to improve Arctic Governance' at UCL in London, UK.\n\nIn April 2018, PRPI Fellow Nic Craig presented on the issue of black carbon in the Arctic and policy and business opportunities to address these issues at North by North Festival in Anchorage, Alaska. \n\nDr Dwayne Ryan Menezes\n\nThe members of the PRPI UK Advisory Board include:\n\nThe members of the PRPI International Advisory Board include:\n"}

To step up the accessibility of its content to viewers RTR Planeta has eagerly embraced new technologies launching in various IPTV, ADSL and other advanced networks.\n\nIn October 2009 a separate version of the TV channel to broadcast via the Eutelsat 36A satellite to Ukrainian TV viewers was especially created. This was done because on November 1, 2008 the Ukrainian Television and Radio Broadcasting Council demanded that (Ukrainian) cable operators remove Russian TV channels that did not adopt the Ukrainian legislation from their broadcasting lists. The decision affected, in particular, RTR-Planeta, Channel One and TV Center. Also, at that time, It was constructed by Alcatel Space is based on the Spacebus-3000B2 satellite bus.

Theoretically Antarctica would be located in all time zones; however, areas south of the Antarctic Circle experience extreme day-night cycles near the times of the June and December solstices, making it difficult to determine which time zone would be appropriate. For practical purposes time zones are usually based on territorial claims; however, many stations use the time of the country they are owned by or the time zone of their supply base (e.g. McMurdo Station and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station use New Zealand time due to their main supply base being Christchurch, New Zealand). Nearby stations can have different time zones, due to their belonging to different countries. Many areas have no time zone since nothing is decided and there are not even any temporary settlements that have any clocks. They are simply labeled with UTC time.\n\nThe file zone.tab of the tz database contains the following zones, columns marked with * contain data from the file zone.tab. Only permanently inhabited stations are tracked by the tz database staff. Some summer only stations with different time might exist.\n\nThe coordinates are latitude and longitude, and for each there are 2 or 3 digits for degrees, 2 digits for minutes and for some 2 digits for seconds.\n\nFor the most part, daylight saving time (DST) is not observed in Antarctica because 95 percent of the continent is located south of the Antarctic Circle and the midnight sun phenomenon renders the use of DST unnecessary, and it would further complicate communication with the claimant countries in the northern hemisphere.\n\nHowever, a few regions such as the Ross Dependency and, formerly, Palmer Land, observe the time and use of DST of the countries they are supplied from, New Zealand and Chile, respectively. The areas have DST during the southern summer, when there is the northern winter, including January.\n\n"}
