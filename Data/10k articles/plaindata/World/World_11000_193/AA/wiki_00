This conference brings together globally renowned scholars who interact with senior members of IDSA as well as senior members of the Indian Government. The 12th Annual Asian Security Conference was hosted by IDSA from 11–13 February. These conferences are by invitation only. At the 2010 Conference, the Indian Defence Minister and Indian Defence Secretary both played key roles. The conference annually explores issues of security affecting South Asia. Attendees for the 2010 Conference included senior academics from the United States, Pakistan, Russia, Iran, India, and the United Kingdom, among others. Notable names included G. John Ikenberry, and Aaron Friedburg from Princeton, Summit Ganguly from the Indiana University, John Geis from Air University. More about the conference and its resulting publications can be found at the IDSA web site at http://www.idsa.in/, where details about the Institutes many publications, events, speakers, and past \"Asia Security Conferences\" can be found.\n\nThere is a more recently developed \"'Asia Security Conference\",' which is an annual event organised by International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). The conference is also known as Shangri-La Dialogue. The first conference was held on 2002 and the success prompted the organisers to make it an annual event. The 8th edition of the conference was held from 29 to 31 May 2009 in Singapore.\n\nAustralia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor Leste, the United Kingdom, the United States, Vietnam are the countries that participated in the 2009 conference.\n\nThe main focus of the meet was shipping security, fighting terrorism and the North Korea's nuclear ambition. The conference was of a particular importance in the backdrop of North Korea's nuclear as well as missile test. There was also criticism that the meeting was organised for achieving peace in the region but the participating countries were more interested in private meetings to discuss weapons purchases.\n\nThe 2005 talks was held in Singapore and focused issues including the U.S.-led War on Terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the emergent roles for India and China in Asian regional security.\n\n18 countries represented at the ministerial-level: Korea, Australia, Cambodia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThrough this Conference, it was found that the United States might have done something wrong in \"dealing with this whole terrorism mess.\"\n"}

It was built in the 18th century to house the city's administrative council, and it was subsequently used as the General Post Office and the Public Registry. The Banca Giuratale now houses the Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Business.\n\nThe Banca Giuratale was originally a house which belonged to Dr. Gio Batta Piotto, and it was taken over by the treasury of the Order of St. John in 1665. In 1721, the Università, which was the local administrative council of Valletta, acquired the building in exchange for its original premises located across the street (now the Monte di Pietà). The building was subsequently reconstructed during the magistracy of Grand Master Marc'Antonio Zondadari. The new building was designed by the architect Romano Carapecchia.\n\nThe Banca Giuratale was renovated in 1762, during the magistracy of Manuel Pinto da Fonseca. Napoleon is said to have spent his last night in Malta, between 13 and 14 June 1798, at this building. The Banca Giuratale remained in use by the Università until that body was suppressed by Governor Thomas Maitland in 1818.\n\nIn 1841, the Banca Giuratale became a post office when the Packet Office was transferred there from the Casa del Commun Tesoro in Piazza Tesoreria. The Island Post Office was also transferred into the Banca Giuratale on 1 April 1849, and the two were merged into the General Post Office in 1885. A year later, the GPO moved to Palazzo Parisio.\n\nFor many years, the Banca Giuratale housed the Public Registry. The latter has now moved to Evans Building, and the Banca Giuratale now houses the Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Business.\n\nThe building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. It is now a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.\n\nThe façade was restored sometimes in 2014.\n\nThe Banca Giuratale is built in the Baroque style. The main portal is flanked by Doric columns which support an open balcony. Two arcades are located on either side of the doorway, above which are oval windows set in blind arches. The first floor contains five ornate windows, and an ornate centrepiece is located above the central window. This includes a bust of Grand Master Zondadari, carved figures and drapery and a marble slab with the following Latin inscription:\n\nThe centrepiece also contained a number of coats of arms, but these were probably defaced during the French occupation of 1798–1800. The central coat of arms was later replaced by the British royal arms in the early 19th century.\n"}

As a body, they usually only assemble to attend state functions like a coronation, inauguration, national day or State Opening of Parliament, depending on local custom. They may also assemble in the royal or presidential palace to give their own head of state's New Year greeting to the head of state of the country in which they are based.\n\nThe term is sometimes confused with the collective body of diplomats \"from\" a particular country—the proper term for which is \"diplomatic service\". The diplomatic corps is not always given any formal recognition by its host country, but can be referenced by official orders of precedence.\n\nIn many countries, and especially in Africa, the heads and the foreign members of the country offices of major international organizations (United Nations agencies, the European Union, the International Committee of the Red Cross, agencies of the African Union, etc.) are considered members—and granted the rights and privileges—of the diplomatic corps.\n\nDiplomatic vehicles in most countries have distinctive diplomatic license plates, often with the prefix or suffix \"CD\", the abbreviation for the French \"corps diplomatique\".\n\nIn some countries, the longest-serving ambassador to a country is given the title dean, or doyen, of the diplomatic corps and is sometimes accorded a high position in the order of precedence. In New Zealand, for example, the dean takes precedence over figures such as the deputy prime minister and former governors-general. In some places the role of senior diplomat is given to the head of the mission of the Holy See referred to as the apostolic nuncio, see below. \n\nThe diplomatic corps may also cooperate amongst itself on a number of matters, including certain dealings with the host government. In practical terms, the dean of the diplomatic corps may have a role to play in negotiating with local authorities regarding the application of aspects of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and diplomatic immunity, such as the payment of certain fees or taxes, since the receiving country is required \"not to discriminate between states\". In this sense, the dean has the role of representing the entire diplomatic corps for matters that affect the corps as a whole, although this function is rarely formalized.\n\nIn many countries that have Roman Catholicism as the official or dominant religion, the apostolic nuncio holds the decanate and is the corps' spokesman on formal occasions; in other cases, the nuncio is treated as an ordinary ambassador of the Holy See and has no special precedence. The Congress of Vienna and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations provided that any country may choose to give nuncios a different precedence than other ambassadors.\n\n\n"}

It stretches from the tip of the Iberian Peninsula at Gibraltar in the southwest to the endorheic basin of the Caspian Sea in Russia in the northeast.\n\nThe Watershed runs northwards through Spain in the Iberian Peninsula towards the Bay of Biscay along the basins of Guadalquivir, Guadiana, Tagus and Douro in the west to the sources of the Ebro in Cantabria. It then follows the main ridge of the Pyrenees eastwards up to Andorra, where it again turns to the north through France along the catchment areas of Garonne (with the summit of the Canal du Midi at Seuil de Naurouze), Loire and Seine in the west and that of the Rhone in the east, marked by the Cévennes mountain range between the sources of the Allier and Ardèche tributaries. \n\nAt the Belfort Gap south of the Vosges Mountains it separates the Rhone basin in the southwest from the drainage of Meuse and Rhine in the northeast, turns southwards to the Swiss Jura Mountains and passes between Lake Geneva and Lake Neuchâtel. It reaches the Bernese Alps where it runs along the Alpine divide to the Gotthard Pass. Mt. Witenwasserenstock marks the triple watershed of the Rhone, Rhine and Po rivers, further to the east along the Grison Alps it reaches the tripoint of the Rhine, Po and Danube basins at the \"roof of Europe\" Piz Lunghin west of the Maloja Pass.\n\nThe divide continues northwards along the Albula Alps to Julier Pass, Albula Pass and Flüela Pass south of Davos between the catchment area of the Rhine, which empties into the North Sea via the Netherlands, and the Danube, which flows eastward emptying into the Black Sea. It enters Austria at Piz Buin in the Silvretta Alps running along the Arlberg massif and forming the border between the states of Tyrol and Vorarlberg. It reaches Bavaria, Germany via the crest of the Allgäu Alps and leaves the High Alps at the Adelegg range near Kempten.\n\nWithin the Alpine foothills it runs north of the Schussen catchment area of Lake Constance towards the sources of the Brigach and Breg headwaters of the Danube in the Black Forest. It then follows the main ridge of the Swabian and Franconian Jura with the crossing of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal northeastwards up to the Fichtelgebirge and southeastwards along the Bohemian Forest, forming the border between Germany and the Austrian Mühlviertel and Waldviertel regions with the Czech Republic, where the large Bohemian basin is drained by the Elbe River. It again turns northeastwards along the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands-Javořice Highlands to the Śnieżnik Mountains of the Eastern Sudetes at the border with Poland, where the tripoint of Orlice, Elbe (North Sea) and Morava, Danube (Black Sea) and Eastern Neisse, Oder (Baltic Sea) is located at the peak of Trójmorski Wierch (Klepý, Klappersteine, Three seas peak, 1144 m above sea level). \n\nThe Watershed continues in eastern direction along the Jeseníky Mountains down to Moravian Gate and uphill into the Beskids, with the Oder and Vistula basins in the north, reaching the tripoint of Poland with Slovakia and Ukraine in the Bieszczady Mountains. Then, the Watershed goes northeast near the Poland–Ukraine border, passes through the city of Lviv and, via Volyn, enters Belarus. Then it runs east-northeast along Belarusian Ridge and continues to the Smolensk Oblast of Russia, ending at the tripoint with Caspian drainage basin in the Sychyovsky District, near the midpoint of Western Russia's cities Smolensk and Tver.\n\nThe watershed is not a clearly defined divide. Tectonics, especially in the area that is now the Upper Rhine Plain, created the River Rhine. As its headward erosion is much stronger than that of the much older River Danube (see the upper river geology) (due to the Rhine's sharper altitude gradient on its much shorter way to the North Sea), the Rhine and its tributaries intrude deeper into phreatic zones of the Swabian Karst and even capture the upper Danube and its surface tributaries.\n\nIt is expected that the Danube's upper course will one day disappear entirely in favour of the Rhine (\"stream capture\").\n\n"}

The massive scale of the Holocaust which happened during World War II heavily affected the Jewish nation and world public opinion, which only understood the dimensions of the Final Solution after the war. The genocide, known as \"HaShoah\" in Hebrew, aimed at the elimination of the Jewish people on the European continent. It was a broadly organized operation led by Nazi Germany, in which approximately six million Jews were murdered methodically and with horrifying cruelty. During the Holocaust in occupied Poland, more than one million Jews were murdered in gas chambers of the Auschwitz concentration camp alone. The murder of the Jews of Europe affected Jewish communities in Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Channel Islands, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Libya, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Moldova, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine.\n\nLeading to World War II, nearly all Jewish firms in Nazi Germany had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been forced to sell out to the Nazi German government as part of the \"Aryanization\" policy inaugurated in 1937. As the war started, of Jews took place originally as part of Operation Tannenberg against the Polish nation. The much larger and methodical mass killings of Jews began with the onset of Operation Barbarossa. Led by \"Einsatzkommandos\" and the Orpo battalions, the destruction of European Jews took place with the active participation of local Auxiliary Police including Belarusian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian \"Schutzmannschaften\".\n\nBefore the onset of war, the first pogrom in Nazi Germany was \"Kristallnacht\", often called \"Pogromnacht\", or \"night of broken glass,\" in which Jewish homes were ransacked in numerous German cities along with 11,000 Jewish shops, towns and villages, as civilians and SA stormtroopers destroyed buildings with sledgehammers, leaving the streets covered in smashed windows — the origin of the name \"Night of Broken Glass.\" Jews were beaten to death; 30,000 Jewish men were taken to concentration camps; and 1,668 synagogues ransacked with 267 set on fire. Following Operation Barbarossa launched on 22 June 1941, in the city of Lviv in the occupied territory of the General Government, Ukrainian nationalists organized two large pogroms in July 1941, in which around 6,000 Jews were murdered.\n\nIn Lithuania, local militant groups engaged in anti-Jewish pogroms on July 25 and 26, 1941 around Kaunas even before the Nazi forces arrived, killing about 3,800 Jews and burning synagogues and Jewish shops. Perhaps the deadliest of these Holocaust-era pogroms was the Iași pogrom in Romania, in which as many as 14,000 Jews were killed by Romanian citizens, police, and military officials.\n\nBy December 1941, Adolf Hitler decided to completely exterminate European Jews. In January 1942, during the Wannsee conference, several Nazi leaders discussed the details of the \"Final Solution of the Jewish question\" (\"Endlösung der Judenfrage\"). Dr. Josef Bühler urged Reinhard Heydrich to proceed with the \"Final Solution\" in the General Government. They began to systematically deport Jewish populations from the ghettos and all occupied territories to the seven camps designated as \"Vernichtungslager,\" or extermination camps: Auschwitz, Birkenau was the Extermination Camp site Belzec, Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibór and Treblinka II. Sebastian Haffner published the analysis in 1978 that Hitler from December 1941 accepted the failure of his goal to dominate Europe forever on his declaration of war against the United States, but that his withdrawal and apparent calm thereafter was sustained by the achievement of his second goal—the extermination of the Jews.\n\nEven as the German Nazi war machine faltered in the last years of the war, precious military resources such as fuel, transport, munitions, soldiers, and industrial resources were still being heavily diverted away from the war and towards the death camps. By the end of the war, more than half of Jewish population of Europe had been killed in the Holocaust. Poland, home of the largest Jewish community in Europe before the war, had over 90% of its Jewish population, or about 3,000,000 Jews, murdered by the Nazis. Greece, Yugoslavia, Lithuania, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, and Latvia each had over 70% of their Jewish population killed.\n\nHungary and Albania lost around half of their Jewish populations, the Soviet Union, Germany, Austria and Luxembourg lost over one third of its Jews, Belgium and France each saw around a quarter of their Jewish populations killed.\n\nDuring the war, Spain became an unlikely haven for several thousand Jews. They were mainly from Western Europe, fleeing deportation to concentration camps from occupied France, but also Sephardic Jews from Eastern Europe, especially in Hungary. Trudy Alexy refers to the \"absurdity\" and \"paradox of refugees fleeing the Nazis' Final Solution to seek asylum in a country where no Jews had been allowed to live openly as Jews for over four centuries.\"\n\nApproximately 1.5 million Jews served in the regular Allied militaries during World War II.\n\nApproximately 550,000 American Jews served in the various branches of the United States armed services. Roughly 52,000 received U.S. military awards. Another 500,000 served in the Red Army, and more than 160,000 earned citations, with over 150 receiving the Hero of the Soviet Union award. Some 100,000 Jews served in the Polish Army during the German invasion, and thousands served in the Free Polish Forces, including about 10,000 in Anders' Army.

Founded in 1967, CIAT currently has 39 member countries and associate member countries from four continents; 31 countries of the Americas, 5 European countries, 2 African countries and 1 Asian country.\n\n\nAfter the authorities of the tax administrations of countries of the Americas visited the United States in 1965 to learn about and discuss on site issues of tax administration, Sheldon Cohen and Harold Moss, at the time commissioner and director, respectively, of the International Assistance Office of the US Internal Revenue Service, had the vision to create an organization that could serve as a permanent forum to address tax administration issues.\n\nA steering committee was designated in order to lay the groundwork for a multilateral tax administrators’ organization. The members of the committee were Sheldon Cohen and Harold Moss (USA), Roberto Hoyo and Alfredo Gutiérrez (Mexico), Jaime Ross and Tomás Aguayo (Chile), Menalco Solís and Targidio Bernal (Panama) and Edison Gnazzo and Emilio Vidal (Uruguay). In the meetings held in 1965 and 1966, said Committee drafted the organization’s Bylaws.\n\nIn May 1967, in the first general assembly held in Panama, the bylaws of the Inter-American Center of Tax Administrators (CIAT) were approved.\n\nIn 1997 a change in the center’s name was approved, becoming the Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations, to emphasize the organization’s institutional nature.\n\nUntil 1977, CIAT’s activities were mainly focused on the organization of international meetings (annual Assembly, conferences and technical seminars), the publication of a newsletter and the creation and maintenance of a library specialized in tax matters. That same year, a Technical Cooperation Agreement was signed with the Federal Republic of Germany, whereby said country appointed a permanent mission to CIAT, which was of great benefit to the organization and its member countries. The Agreement was in place until 1997 and facilitated CIAT’s entering into the field of technical assistance.\n\nIn 1982 and 1983, technical cooperation agreements were signed with France and Spain, respectively, as a result of which permanent missions of said countries were appointed to CIAT’s headquarters in Panama.\n\nIn addition, in 1983, the Regional Technical Cooperation Project on the Single Taxpayers’ Registry and Current Account, RUC/CC (as per the Spanish acronym) was undertaken for Central America and the Caribbean, financed by the IDB and administered by CIAT. The Center then started acting as a specialized agency rendering technical assistance services for the tax administrations of Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIn 1987, in the General Assembly held in Uruguay, the reform of the Bylaws was approved, creating the category of Associate Member Countries. This enabled the accession under such status of Spain and Portugal in 1990, France in 1991, Italy in 1995, and The Netherlands in 1996.\n\nThe institutional evolution process continued in the course of the 1990s with, on the one hand, the increasing use of information technology and management tools like strategic planning, and, on the other, the increasing interest and commitment on the part of the European associate member countries, five of which became full members in 2001.\n\nAnother significant event in the history of CIAT was the incorporation as associate members of the Czech Republic and South Africa in the Assembly held in Bolivia in 2004, Kenya in the General Assembly held in Brazil in 2006, and India in the General Assembly held in Guatemala in 2009. The last General Assembly was held in Buenos Aires on April 22–25, 2013.\n\nThe participation of all these countries has made it possible to significantly increase and improve CIAT’s chances to meet its purpose of supporting the strengthening and modernization of the tax administrations of its member countries.\n\nIt is worth noting that the volume and scope of CIAT activities, as well as the number of member countries and associate member countries from different continents has expanded significantly since its creation, which allows us to assert that our Center is currently the largest and major world organization of tax administrations.As such, it has signed cooperation agreements with the most relevant public and private international entities specialized in tax matters.\n\nHead-offices are located in Panama City, Republic of Panama, and its official languages are Spanish, English, Portuguese and French.\n\nTraining activities are mostly in virtual mode and aim to help improve professional standards of tax administration officials through the design and implementation of training programs according to the need of the member countries tax administrations. \nOn line courses are offered in the areas of international taxation, tax administration, Human Resources, political and technical aspects of taxation, tax management. \n\nAmong the main activities carried out by CIAT in this area:\n\nCIAT is composed of the tax administrations of 39 member countries and associate member countries – 31 countries from the Americas, 5 European countries, 2 African countries and 1 Asian country.

The IEEPA authorizes the president to declare the existence of an \"unusual and extraordinary threat... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States\" that originates \"in whole or substantial part outside the United States.\" It further authorizes the president, after such a declaration, to block transactions and freeze assets to deal with the threat. In the event of an actual attack on the United States, the president can also confiscate property connected with a country, group, or person that aided in the attack.\n\nThe IEEPA falls under the provisions of the National Emergencies Act (NEA), which means that an emergency declared under the act must be renewed annually to remain in effect.\n\nCongress enacted the IEEPA in 1977 to clarify and restrict presidential power during times of declared national emergency under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 (\"TWEA\"). Under TWEA, starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, presidents had the power to declare emergencies without limiting their scope or duration, without citing the relevant statutes, and without congressional oversight. The Supreme Court in \"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer\" limited what a president could do in such an emergency, but did not limit the emergency declaration power itself. A 1973 Senate investigation found (in Senate Report 93-549) that four declared emergencies remained in effect: the 1933 banking crisis with respect to the hoarding of gold, a 1950 emergency with respect to the Korean War, a 1970 emergency regarding the postal workers strike, and a 1971 emergency in response to the government's deteriorating economic and fiscal conditions. Congress terminated these emergencies with the National Emergencies Act, and then passed the IEEPA to restore the emergency power in a limited, overseeable form.\n\nUnlike TWEA, IEEPA was drafted to permit presidential emergency declarations only in response to threats originating outside the United States. Beginning with Jimmy Carter in response to the Iran Hostage Crisis, presidents have invoked IEEPA to safeguard U.S. national security interests by freezing or \"blocking\" assets of belligerent foreign governments, or certain foreign nationals abroad.\n\nFollowing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13224 under IEEPA to block the assets of terrorist organizations. The President delegated blocking authority to federal agencies led by the U.S. Treasury. In October 2001, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act which, in part, enhanced the IEEPA asset blocking provisions under §1702(a)(1)(B) to permit the blocking of assets during the \"pendency of an investigation.\" This statutory change gave the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control the power to block assets without the need to provide evidence of the blocking subject's wrongdoing nor to permit the blocking subject a chance to effectively respond to the allegations in court. Executing these blocking actions led to a series of legal cases challenging federal authority to indefinitely prevent charitable organizations from accessing their assets held in the United States.\n\n\n\n, the following IEEPA emergencies are active.\n\n"}

{"id": "21624273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21624273", "title": "Kingdom of Kush", "text": "Kingdom of Kush\n\nThe Kingdom of Kush or Kush () was an ancient kingdom in Nubia, located at the Sudanese and southern Egyptian Nile Valley.\n\nThe Kushite era of rule in Nubia was established after the Late Bronze Age collapse and the disintegration of the New Kingdom of Egypt. Kush was centered at Napata during its early phase. After Kashta (\"the Kushite\") invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the monarchs of Kush were also the pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt, until they were expelled by the Neo-Assyrian Empire under the rule of Esarhaddon a century later.\n\nDuring classical antiquity, the Kushite imperial capital was located at Meroë. In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as Aethiopia. The Kingdom of Kush with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. The seat was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the Kingdom of Aksum. Afterwards the Nubians established the three, eventually Christianized, kingdoms of Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia.\n\nThe native name of the Kingdom was recorded in Egyptian as ', likely pronounced /kuɫuʃ/ \"or \"'/kuʔuʃ/ \"in Middle Egyptian when the term is first used for Nubia, based on the New Kingdom-era Akkadian transliteration as the genitive \"kūsi\".\n\nIt is also an ethnic term for the native population who initiated the kingdom of Kush. The term is also displayed in the names of Kushite persons, such as King Kashta (a transcription of \"k3š-t3\" \"(one from) the land of Kush\"). Geographically, Kush referred to the region south of the first cataract in general. Kush also was the home of the rulers of the 25th dynasty.\n\nThe name \"Kush\", since at least the time of Josephus, has been connected with the biblical character Cush, in the Hebrew Bible (Hebrew: כוש), son of Ham (Genesis 10:6). Ham had four sons named: Cush, Put, Canaan and Mizraim (Hebrew name for Egypt). According to the Bible, Nimrod, a son of Cush, was the founder and king of Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in Shinar (Gen 10:10). The Bible also makes reference to someone named Cush who is a Benjamite (Psalms 7:1, KJV).\n\nSome modern scholars, such as Friedrich Delitzsch, have suggested that the biblical Cush might be linked to the Kassites of the Zagros Mountains (modern Iran).\n\nMentuhotep II, the 21st century BC founder of the Middle Kingdom, is recorded to have undertaken campaigns against Kush in the 29th and 31st years of his reign. This is the earliest Egyptian reference to \"Kush\"; the Nubian region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom. Under Thutmose I, Egypt made several campaigns south. This eventually resulted in their annexation of Nubia circa 1504 BC. After the conquest, Kerma culture was increasingly Egyptianized, yet rebellions continued for 220 years until c. 1300 BC. During the New Kingdom, Nubia nevertheless became a key province of the New Kingdom, economically, politically and spiritually. Indeed, major Pharonic ceremonies were held at Jebel Barkal near Napata. As an Egyptian colony from the 16th century BC, Nubia (\"Kush\") was governed by an Egyptian Viceroy of Kush. With the disintegration of the New Kingdom around 1070 BC, \"Kush\" became an independent kingdom centered at Napata in modern northern Sudan.\n\nThe extent of cultural/political continuity between the Kerma culture and the chronologically succeeding Kingdom of Kush is difficult to determine. The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BC, 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. By 1200 BC, Egyptian involvement in the Dongola Reach was nonexistent. By the 8th century BC, the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper Dongola Reach. The first Napatan king, Alara, dedicated his sister to the cult of Amun at the rebuilt Kawa temple, while temples were also rebuilt at Barkal and Kerma. A Kashta stele at Elephantine, places the Kushites on the Egyptian frontier by the mid-eighteenth century. This first period of the kingdom's history, the 'Napatan', was succeeded by the 'Meroitic', when the royal cemeteries relocated to Meroe around 300 BC.\n\nThe Kushites buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves. Archaeologists refer to these practices as the \"Pan-grave culture\". This was given its name due to the way in which the remains are buried. They would dig a pit and put stones around them in a circle. Kushites also built burial mounds and pyramids, and shared some of the same gods worshiped in Egypt, especially Ammon and Isis. With the worshiping of these gods the Kushites began to take some of the names of the gods as their throne names.\n\nThe Kush rulers were regarded as guardians of the state religion and were responsible for maintaining the houses of the gods. Some scholars believe the economy in the Kingdom of Kush was a redistributive system. The state would collect taxes in the form of surplus produce and would redistribute to the people. Others believe that most of the society worked on the land and required nothing from the state and did not contribute to the state. Northern Kush seemed to be more productive and wealthier than the Southern area.\n\nDental trait analysis of fossils dating from the Meroitic period in Semna, Nubia, found that they were closely related to Afroasiatic-speaking populations inhabiting the Nile, Horn of Africa, Maghreb and Canary Islands. The Meroitic skeletons and these ancient and recent fossils were also phenotypically distinct from those belonging to recent Niger–Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan-speaking populations in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as from the Mesolithic inhabitants of Jebel Sahaba in Nubia.\n\nResistance to the early eighteenth Dynasty Egyptian rule by neighbouring Kush is evidenced in the writings of Ahmose, son of Ebana, an Egyptian warrior who served under Nebpehtrya Ahmose (1539-1514 BC), Djeserkara Amenhotep I (1514–1493 BC) and Aakheperkara Thutmose I (1493–1481 BC). At the end of the Second Intermediate Period (mid-sixteenth century BC), Egypt faced the twin existential threats—the Hyksos in the North and the Kushites in the South. Taken from the autobiographical inscriptions on the walls of his tomb-chapel, the Egyptians undertook campaigns to defeat Kush and conquer Nubia under the rule of Amenhotep I (1514–1493 BC). In Ahmose's writings, the Kushites are described as archers, \"Now after his Majesty had slain the Bedoin of Asia, he sailed upstream to Upper Nubia to destroy the Nubian bowmen.\" The tomb writings contain two other references to the Nubian bowmen of Kush.\n\nEgypt's international prestige had declined considerably towards the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its historical allies, the inhabitants of Canaan, had fallen to the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1020 BC), and then the resurgent Neo-Assyrian Empire (935–605 BC). The Assyrians, from the 10th century BC onwards, had once more expanded from northern Mesopotamia, and conquered a vast empire, including the whole of the Near East, and much of Anatolia, the eastern Mediterranean, the Caucasus and early Iron Age Iran.\n\nIn 945 BC, Shoshenq I and Libu princes took control of the Nile Delta and founded the Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt, also known as the Libyan or Bubastite dynasty, which would rule for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. In 711, Shoshenq made Memphis his northern capital. However, Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in Leontopolis and Kushites threatened from the south.\n\nAlara founded the Napatan, or 25th, Kushite dynasty at Napata in Nubia, now Sudan. Alara's successor Kashta extended Kushite control north to Elephantine and Thebes in Upper Egypt. Kashta's successor Piye seized control of Lower Egypt around 727 BC. Piye's 'Victory Stela', celebrating these campaigns between 728-716 BC, was found in the Amun temple at Jebel Barkal. He invaded an Egypt fragmented into four kingdoms, ruled by King Peftjauawybast, King Nimlot, King Iuput II, and King Osorkon IV.\n\nWhy the Kushites chose to enter Egypt at this crucial point of foreign domination is subject to debate. Archaeologist Timothy Kendall offers his own hypotheses, connecting it to a claim of legitimacy associated with Jebel Barkal. Kendall cites the Victory Stele of Piye at Jebel Barkal, which states that \"Amun of Napata granted me to be ruler of every foreign country,\" and \"Amun in Thebes granted me to be ruler of the Black Land (Kmt)\". According to Kendall, \"foreign lands\" in this regard seems to include Lower Egypt while \"Kmt\" seems to refer to a united Upper Egypt and Nubia.\n\nPiye's successor, Shabaqo, defeated the Saite kings of northern Egypt between 711-710 BC, and installed himself as king in Memphis. He then established ties with Sargon II.\n\nPiye's son Taharqa enjoyed some minor initial success in his attempts to regain Egyptian influence in the Near East. He aided King Hezekiah from attack by Sennacherib and the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:9; Isaiah 37:9), however disease among the besieging Assyrian army appears to have been the main cause of failure to take Jerusalem rather than any military setback, and Assyrian records indicate Hezekiah was forced to pay tribute. The Assyrian King Sennacherib then defeated Taharqa and drove the Nubians and Egyptians from the region and back over the Sinai into Egypt.\n\nThe power of the 25th Dynasty reached a climax under Taharqa. The Nile valley empire was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. New prosperity revived Egyptian culture. Religion, the arts, and architecture were restored to their glorious Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms. The Nubian pharaohs built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, and Jebel Barkal. It was during the 25th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom. The Kushites developed their own script, the Meroitic alphabet, which was influenced by Egyptian writing systems circa 700–600 BC, although it appears to have been wholly confined to the royal court and major temples.\n\nTaharqa initially defeated the Assyrians, when war broke out in 674 BC. Yet, in 671 BC, the Assyrian King Esarhaddon, took Memphis, and Taharqo retreated to the south, while his heir and other family members were taken to Assyria as prisoners. However, the native Egyptian vassal rulers installed by Esarhaddon as puppets were unable to effectively retain full control, and Taharqa was able regain control of Memphis. Esarhaddon's 669 BC campaign to once more eject Taharqa, was abandoned when Esarhaddon died in Palestine on the way to Egypt. Yet, Esarhaddon's successor, Ashurbanipal, did defeat Taharqa, and Taharqa died soon after.\n\nTaharqa's successor Tantamani attempted to regain Egypt. He successfully defeated Necho, the subject ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Thebes in the process. The Assyrians, who had a military presence in the north, then sent a large army southwards in 663 BC. Tantamani was routed, and the Assyrian army sacked Thebes to such an extent it never truly recovered. Tantamani was chased back to Nubia, and never threatened the Assyrian Empire again. A native Egyptian ruler, Psamtik I, was placed on the throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal. The last links between Kush and Upper Egypt were severed after hostilities with the Saite kings in the 590s BC.\n\nAspelta moved the capital to Meroë, considerably farther south than Napata, possibly in 591 BC. It is also possible that Meroë had always been the Kushite capital.\n\nMartin Meredith states the Kushite rulers chose Meroë, between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts, because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for iron working. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the Red Sea. The Kush traded iron products with the Romans, in addition to gold, ivory and slaves. Yet, the Butana plain was stripped of its forests, leaving behind slag piles.\n\nThe Kushites used the animal-driven water wheel to increase productivity and create a surplus, particularly during the Napatan-Meroitic Kingdom.\n\nHerodotus mentioned an invasion of Kush by the Achaemenid ruler Cambyses (circa 530 BC), who possibly succeeded in occupying the area between the first and second Nile cataract. Achaemenid inscriptions from both Egypt and Iran include Kush as part of the Achaemenid empire. For example the DNa inscription of Darius I (reigned 522–486 BC) on his tomb at Naqsh-e Rustam mentions \"Kūšīyā\" (Old Persian cuneiform: 𐎤𐎢𐏁𐎡𐎹𐎠, pronounced \"Kūshīyā\") among the territories being \"ruled over\" by the Achaemenid Empire. Archaeological evidence suggests that the fortress of Dorginarti near the second cataract served as Persia's southern boundary.\n\nIn about 300 BC the move to Meroë was made more complete when the monarchs began to be buried there, instead of at Napata. One theory is that this represents the monarchs breaking away from the power of the priests at Napata. According to Diodorus Siculus, a Kushite king, \"Ergamenes\", defied the priests and had them slaughtered. This story may refer to the first ruler to be buried at Meroë with a similar name such as Arqamani, who ruled many years after the royal cemetery was opened at Meroë. During this same period, Kushite authority may have extended some 1,500 km along the Nile River valley from the Egyptian frontier in the north to areas far south of modern Khartoum and probably also substantial territories to the east and west.\n\nKushite civilization continued for several centuries. In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars. It is not as yet possible to connect the Meroitic language with other known languages.\n\nStrabo describes a war with the Romans in the 1st century BC. After the initial victories of Kandake (or \"Candace\") Amanirenas against Roman Egypt, the Kushites were defeated and Napata sacked. Remarkably, the destruction of the capital of Napata was not a crippling blow to the Kushites and did not frighten Candace enough to prevent her from again engaging in combat with the Roman military. Indeed, it seems that Petronius's attack might have had a revitalizing influence on the kingdom. Just three years later, in 22 BC, a large Kushite force moved northward with intention of attacking Qasr Ibrim.\n\nAlerted to the advance, Petronius again marched south and managed to reach Qasr Ibrim and bolster its defences before the invading Kushites arrived. Although the ancient sources give no description of the ensuing battle, we know that at some point the Kushites sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace settlement with Petronius. By the end of the second campaign, however, Petronius was in no mood to deal further with the Kushites. The Kushites succeeded in negotiating a peace treaty on favourable terms and trade between the two nations increased. Some historians like Theodore Mommsen wrote that during Augustus times Nubia was a possible client state of the Roman Empire.\n\nIt is possible that the Roman emperor Nero planned another attempt to conquer Kush before his death in AD 68. Nero sent two centurions upriver as far as Bahr el Ghazal River in 66 CE in an attempt to discover the source of the Nile. Kush began to fade as a power by the 1st or 2nd century AD, sapped by the war with the Roman province of Egypt and the decline of its traditional industries.\nChristianity began to gain over the old pharaonic religion and by the mid-sixth century AD the Kingdom of Kush was dissolved.\n\nThe Meroitic language was spoken in Meroë and the Sudan during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BC). It became extinct about 400 AD. The language was written in two forms of the Meroitic alphabet: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a stylus and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of bilingual texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180–170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen Shanakdakhete. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.\n\nBy the 3rd century BC, a new indigenous alphabet, the Meroitic, consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. Meroitic is an alphabet originally derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs that was used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Meroë/Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (about 700–300 BCE), and first appears in the second century BCE. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the Old Nubian language of the successor Nubian kingdoms.\n\nIt is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Claude Rilly has proposed that it, like the Nobiin language, belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the Egyptian language, instead belongs to the Afro-Asiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics, which are similar to those of the Afro-Asiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages.\n\nOn account of the Kingdom of Kush's proximity to Ancient Egypt — the first cataract at Elephantine usually being considered the traditional border between the two polities — and because the 25th dynasty ruled over both states in the 8th century BC, from the Rift Valley to the Taurus mountains, historians have closely associated the study of Kush with Egyptology, in keeping with the general assumption that the complex sociopolitical development of Egypt's neighbours can be understood in terms of Egyptian models. As a result, the political structure and organization of Kush as an independent ancient state has not received as thorough attention from scholars, and there remains much ambiguity especially surrounding the earliest periods of the state. Edwards has suggested that study of the region could benefit from increased recognition of Kush as a state in its own right, with distinct cultural conditions, rather than merely as a secondary state on the periphery of Egypt.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The local county works department of Oyster Bay pulled down the ruins of the home in 1959, for reasons of safety. A garden pavilion remained for many years, progressively vandalized, until it was razed to its foundation, also for safety reasons. The most visible present remains of the estate are the remnants of a double staircase to the old formal gardens, where traces of landscaping remain, some walkways disappearing under fallen litter and leaves, the pillars and entablatures of a pair of kiosks, and the gate structure at the old entrance to the grounds.\n\nThe ruins of the mansion's gardens and grounds are now part of the Muttontown Preserve, with the gated entrance located on Jericho-Oyster Bay Road (Route 106).\n\n"}

Initially active between 1988 and 2000, they achieved stardom in the early 1990s with their first two albums, \"Bumm\" (1991) and \"Lele kako\" (1993). In 1997, their lead singer Nikolai Yordanov left and the band's popularity declined, which led to their dissolution in 2000. They reformed in their original lineup in 2009 for a short Bulgarian tour, then reformed in 2014 with a new lead singer, Ivan Gatev.\n\nThe band was formed in 1988 and were one of the first official punk bands in the country. Their first recordings, \"Tryabva vsichko da priemam\" and \"Nai-vazhnoto\", were for the 1988 film \"Pred praga\" (At the Doorstep). Later that year, they released a demo tape called \"Stariyat dub\". The tape contained 8 songs.\n\nIn 1989, they were signed to Balkanton and released a split LP with Nova Generacia. The Kontrol side consisted of the first six songs from \"Stariyat dub\". They then performed at the \"Svyat - chudni hora\" festival in Michurin. The first song they played, \"Ima\" (originally released on \"Stariyat dub\") appeared on the official compilation in 1990.\n\nIn 1990, they recorded 15 songs at the BNR Studio II. After the fall of communism, 14 of the tracks were released on the \"BUMM\" cassette in 1991.\n\nIn 1992, they recorded their second album, \"Lele kako\", released in 1993. They also released the \"88-92\" compilation. The A-side consisted of the \"Pred praga\" tracks, an unreleased track called \"Bulgaria\" and the six songs from the \"BG Rock I\" split. The B-side consisted of songs from \"BUMM\" and \"Lele kako\". That year, \"BUMM\" was also reissued on cassette by Lazarov Records with the \"Pred praga\" songs and an unreleased version of \"Ne umirahme ot shtastie\".\n\nThe band released their third album, \"LyubOFF\", in 1994. In 1996, they released a concert album called \"Punku nema'a umre\".\n\nIn 1998, founder Nikolai Yordanov left the band and was replaced by Petar Stanoev. With Stanoev, they released their fourth and final album, \"Pazete si decata\" in 1999. The band broke up a year later.\n\nIn 2004, the compilation \"Te t'va e\" was released, containing 22 songs from the Nikolai Yordanov period. In 2006, they recorded a song called \"Urok po tanci\".\n\nIn 2009, they embarked on a short tour of Bulgaria with Revyu and Hipodil.\n\nIn 2014, the band reformed with new singer Ivan Gatev. Their new album \"9\" was released in April 2017.\n\n\n"}

The company is today entirely owned and controlled by SES and has no independent existence.\n\nThe 2004 SES Annual Report states that 16.4 million homes received broadcast and broadband services from the Sirius system, 1.5 million from the satellites directly and another 14.9 million from cable networks distributing content via Sirius.\n\nIn 1982 the governments of Sweden and Norway formed NSAB as part of a wide ranging partnership for the purpose of \"telecommunication satellite cooperation\". In 1989 the two governments agreed to end their partnership, the Swedish government assumed full ownership with the acquisition of Norway's 15% share.\n\nOn April 2, 1989 NSAB's first satellite, the Aérospatiale built Tele-X, was launched on an Ariane 2 rocket from French Guiana. The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) was contracted to operate the TELE-X system and in 1993 the company acquired the Swedish government's shares, becoming the sole owner.\n\nIn late 1993 NSAB acquired Marco Polo 1, a Hughes 376 geostationary communications satellite, from British Sky Broadcasting. Marco Polo 1 was built for and operated by British Satellite Broadcasting. However following that company's collapse it merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB. In this \"merger\" Sky was the dominant force and their system of transponder lease from SES' Astra satellites was maintained. Marco Polo 1 (and its sister satellite) were gradually withdrawn from service.\n\nIn February 1994 Teracom acquired a 50% share of NSAB. The same month Marco Polo 1 re-entered service as Sirius 1 at 5°E. In July 1994 NSAB agreed the purchase of Sirius 2 from Aérospatiale (later Alcatel Space). The satellite was successfully launched on November 12, 1997 by Ariane 4 rocket. Shortly after launch SES signed a lease agreement for all transponders on the satellite.\n\nIn 1996 Tele Danmark acquired a 25% share in NSAB from Teracom.\n\nIn May 1997 NSAB ordered a Hughes 376HP, the satellite was successfully launched on October 5, 1998, again by Ariane 4 rocket.\n\nIn October 2000 SES acquired the shares of Tele Danmark and Teracom to become 50-50 joint owner with SSC. SES increased its shareholding to 75% in December 2003, and renamed the company to SES Sirius on December 1, 2005. In January 2008, SES further increased its shareholding in SES Sirius to 90%.\n\nIn March 2010 SES (as then subsidiary SES Astra) took full control and in June 2010 the company was renamed SES Astra and the only fully operational satellite, Sirius 4, renamed Astra 4A.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2273535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2273535", "title": "Shanghai International Settlement", "text": "Shanghai International Settlement\n\nThe Shanghai International Settlement () originated from the 1863 merger of the British and American enclaves in Shanghai, parts of the Qing Empire held extraterritorially under the terms of a series of Unequal Treaties.\n\nThe settlements were established following the defeat of the Qing army by the British in the First Opium War (18391842). Under the terms of the Treaty of Nanking, the five treaty ports including Shanghai were opened to foreign merchants, overturning the monopoly then held by the southern port of Canton (Guangzhou) under the Canton System. The British also established a base on Hong Kong under an extensive lease. American and French involvement followed closely on the heels of the British and their enclaves were established north and south, respectively, of the British area.\n\nUnlike the colonies of Hong Kong and Macau, where Great Britain and Portugal enjoyed full sovereignty in perpetuity, the foreign concessions in China remained under Chinese sovereignty. In 1854, the three countries created the Shanghai Municipal Council to serve all their interests, but, in 1862, the French concession dropped out of the arrangement. The following year the British and American settlements formally united to create the Shanghai International Settlement. As more foreign powers entered into treaty relations with China, their nationals also became part of the administration of the settlement, but it always remained a predominantly British affair until the growth of Japan's involvement in the late 1930s.\n\nThe international settlement came to an abrupt end in December 1941 when Japanese troops stormed in immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor. In early 1943, new treaties signed by Chiang Kai-shek's Republican government formally ended the extraterritorial privileges of Americans and Britons, although its terms were moot until the recovery of Shanghai following Japan's 1945 surrender. The French later surrendered their privileges in a separate 1946 agreement.\n\nAlthough Europeans had shown more interest in Canton than Shanghai early on for commercial advantages, the port’s strategic position was key to British interests as the island nation declared war against China in 1839, later known as the first Anglo-Chinese Opium War. The first settlement in Shanghai for foreigners was the British settlement, opened in 1843 under the terms of the Treaty of Nanking, one of the many unequal treaties China incurred in opposition to its European trading partners.\nOn the orders of Sir Henry Pottinger, first Governor-general of Hong Kong, Captain George Balfour of the East India Company's Madras Artillery arrived as Britain's first consul in Shanghai on 8November 1843 aboard the steamer \"Medusa\". The next morning Balfour sent word to the circuit intendant of Shanghai, Gong Mujiu (then romanised Kung Moo-yun), requesting a meeting, at which he indicated his desire to find a house to live in. Initially Balfour was told no such properties were available, but on leaving the meeting, he received an offer from a pro-British Cantonese named Yao to rent a large house within the city walls for four hundred dollars per annum. Balfour, his interpreter Walter Henry Medhurst, surgeon Dr. Hale and clerk A. F. Strachan moved into the luxuriously furnished 52-room house immediately.\n\nIt served as the consulate during construction of a Western-style building within the official Settlement boundaries just to the south of Suzhou Creek. This was completed within a year. This soon became the epicentre of the British settlement. Afterward both the French and the Americans signed treaties with China that gave their citizens extraterritorial rights similar to those granted to the British, but initially their respective nationals accepted that the foreign settlement came under British consular jurisdiction. However, it must be clearly understood that Shanghai has been from the beginning a settlement, not a possession. The British Government annexed Hong Kong, which became British territory, and subject to British law. The land on which the Foreign Settlement of Shanghai was created was, on the other hand, only leased to the British Government. That is proved by the fact that all the landowners still pay ground rent to the Chinese Government.\n\nThe Sino-American Treaty of Wanghia was signed in July 1844 by Chinese Qing government official Qiying, the Viceroy of Liangguang, who held responsibility for the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, and Massachusetts politician Caleb Cushing (1800–1879), who was dispatched with orders to \"save the Chinese from the condition of being an exclusive monopoly in the hands of England\" as a consequence of the 1842 Nanking treaty. Under the Treaty of Wanghia, Americans gained the same rights as those enjoyed by the British in China's treaty ports. It also contained a clause that effectively carved out Shanghai as an extraterritorial zone within Imperial China, though it did not actually give the American government a true legal concession.\n\nIt was only in 1845 that Britain followed in America's footsteps and signed a land-deal to allow Britons to rent land in Shanghai in perpetuity. The American consular presence did not create a problem for the British because it was never intended to have a post in person. Since American traders in China were prohibited from engaging in the opium trade (though almost all were active in this trade), their business transactions were conducted under the auspices of British firms. The only serious incident of political complaint against the Americans was in 1845, when the Stars and Stripes was raised by the acting US Consul, Henry G. Wolcott, who had just arrived in the city. Neither the British nor the Chinese governor approved of the display. In 1848, France established its own French concession under French consular jurisdiction, squeezed between the British settlement to the north and the Chinese walled city to the south.\n\nDuring the Taiping Rebellion, with the Concessions effectively landlocked by both the Manchu government and Small Swords Society rebels, the Western residents of the Shanghai International Settlement, known as \"Shanghailanders\", refused to pay taxes to the Chinese government except for land and maritime rates (nominally because Shanghai's customs house had been burnt down). They also claimed the right to exclude Chinese troops from the concession areas. While the Settlement had at first disallowed non-foreigners from living inside its boundaries, a large number of Chinese were allowed to move into the International Settlement to escape the Taipings or seek better economic opportunities. Chinese entry was subsequently legalised and continued to grow.\n\nOn 11July 1854 a committee of Western businessmen met and held the first annual meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC, formally the Council for the Foreign Settlement North of the Yang-king-pang), ignoring protests of consular officials, and laid down the Land Regulations which established the principles of self-government. The aims of this first Council were simply to assist in the formation of roads, refuse collection, and taxation across the disparate Concessions.\n\nIn 1863 the American concession—land fronting the Huangpu River to the north-east of Soochow Creek (Suzhou Creek)—officially joined the British Settlement (stretching from Yang-ching-pang Creek to Suzhou Creek) to become the Shanghai International Settlement. The French concession remained independent and the Chinese retained control over the original walled city and the area surrounding the foreign enclaves. This would later result in sometimes absurd administrative outcomes, such as needing three drivers' licenses to travel through the complete city.\n\nBy the late-1860s Shanghai's official governing body had been practically transferred from the individual concessions to the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局, literally \"Works Department\", from the standard English local government title of 'Board of works'). The British Consul was the \"de jure\" authority in the Settlement, but he had no actual power unless the ratepayers (who voted for the Council) agreed. Instead, he and the other consulates deferred to the Council.\n\nThe Council had become a practical monopoly over the city's businesses by the mid-1880s. It bought up all the local gas-suppliers, electricity producers and water-companies, then — during the 20th-century — took control over all non-private rickshaws and the Settlement tramways. It also regulated opium sales and prostitution until their banning in 1918 and 1920 respectively.\n\nUntil the late-1920s, therefore, the SMC and its subsidiaries, including the police, power station, and public works, were British dominated (though not controlled, since Britain itself had no authority over the Council). Some of the Settlement's actions during this period, such as the May 30th Movement, in which Chinese demonstrators were shot by members of the Shanghai Municipal Police, did embarrass and threaten the British Empire's position in China even though they were not carried out by \"Britain\" itself.\n\nNo Chinese residing in the International Settlement were permitted to join the council until 1928. Amongst the many members who served on the council, its chairman during the 1920s, Stirling Fessenden, is possibly the most notable. An American, he served as the settlement's main administrator during Shanghai's most turbulent era, and was considered more \"British\" than the council's British members. He oversaw many of the major incidents of the decade, including the May 30th Movement and the White Terror that came with the Shanghai massacre of 1927.\n\nThrough an informal agreement, by the 1930s the British had five seats on the Council, the Japanese two and the Americans and others two. At the 1936 Council election, because of their increasing interests in the Settlement, the Japanese nominated three candidates. Only two were elected, which led to a Japanese protest after 323 uncounted votes were discovered. As a result, the election was declared invalid and a new poll held on April20-21 1936, at which the Japanese nominated only two candidates, leaving the structure of the Council unchanged.\n\nThe International Settlement was wholly foreign-controlled, with staff of all nationalities, including British, Americans, Danes, Italians and Germans. In reality, the British held the largest number of seats on the Council and headed all the Municipal departments (British included Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians, Newfoundlanders, and South Africans whose extraterritorial rights were established by the United Kingdom treaty).\n\nThe only department not chaired by a Briton was the Municipal Orchestra, which was controlled by an Italian.\n\nThe Settlement maintained its own fire-service, police force (the Shanghai Municipal Police), and even possessed its own military reserve in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps (). Following some disturbances at the British concession in Hankow in 1927, the defences at Shanghai were augmented by a permanent battalion of the British Army, which was referred to as the Shanghai Defence Force (SDF or SHAF), and a contingent of US Marines. Other armed forces would arrive in Shanghai; the French Concession had a defensive force of Annamite troops, the Italians also introduced their own marines, as did the Japanese (whose troops eventually outnumbered the other countries' many times over).\n\nArticle 28 of the International Settlement's \"Land Regulations\" stated unequivocally that \"the land encompassed in the territory remains Chinese territory, subject to China's sovereign rights.\" As expressed by legal experts, \" \"the self-governing International Settlement possesses no more power than the mere delegation of purely local and municipal powers and functions. Control of police, sanitation, roads, and other problems of local administration are granted to the Municipal Council simply because that body happens to be the one best equipped to deal with these matters in an area where the large majority of foreigners dwell. But the Municipal Council is in no sense a political body. Its powers, being delegated and hence limited, are subject to strict construction. What foreigners acquire is simply the delegated power of municipal administration, while the reserve powers remain in the sovereign grantor, the Chinese Government. Although under the control of the Consular Council, the area is still Chinese territory, over which China's sovereignty remains unsurrendered\".\n\nIn the 19th century, Europeans possessed treaty ports in Japan in the same way they held those in China. However, Japan rapidly developed into a modern nation, and by the turn of the 20th century the Japanese had successfully negotiated with all powers to abrogate all unequal treaties with it. Japan stood alongside the other European powers as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance during the infamous fifty five-day siege of the foreign embassy compound in Peking. Japan entered the 20th century as a rising world power, and with its unequal treaties with the European powers now abrogated, it actually joined in, obtaining an unequal treaty with China granting extraterritorial rights under the Treaty of Shimonoseki signed in 1895.\n\nIn 1915, during the First World War, Japan overtook Britain as the country with the largest number of foreign residents in Shanghai. In 1914 they sided with Britain and France in the war and conquered all German possessions in China. By the beginning of the 1930s, Japan was swiftly becoming the most powerful national group in Shanghai and accounted for some 80% of all extraterritorial foreigners in China. Much of Hongkew, which had become an unofficial Japanese settlement, was known as \"Little Tokyo\".\n\nIn 1931, supposed \"protection of Japanese colonists from Chinese aggression\" in Hongkew was used as a pretext for the Shanghai Incident, when Japanese troops invaded Shanghai. From then until the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) Hongkew was almost entirely outside of the SMC's hands, with law and protection enforced to varying degrees by the Japanese Consular Police and Japanese members of the Shanghai Municipal Police.\n\nIn 1932 there were 1,040,780 Chinese living within the International Settlement, with another 400,000 fleeing into the area after the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937. For the next five years, the International Settlement and the French Concession were surrounded by Japanese occupiers and Chinese revolutionaries, with conflict often spilling into the Settlement's borders. In 1941, the Japanese launched an abortive political bid to take over the SMC: during a mass meeting of ratepayers at the Settlement Race Grounds, a Japanese official leaped up and shot William Keswick, then Chairman of the Council. While Keswick was only wounded, a near riot broke out.\n\nBritain evacuated its garrisons from mainland Chinese cities, particularly Shanghai, in August 1940.\n\nAnglo-American influence effectively ended after 8 December 1941, when the Imperial Japanese Army entered and occupied the British and American controlled parts of the city in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The French and Americans surrendered without a shot, while the only British riverboat in Shanghai, HMS \"Peterel\", refused to surrender and was sunk although nobody was killed.\n\nEuropean Shanghai residents were forced to wear armbands to differentiate them, were evicted from their homes, and — just like Chinese citizens — were liable to maltreatment. All were liable for punitive punishments, torture and even death during the period of Japanese occupation. The Japanese sent European and American citizens to be interned at the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center, a work camp on what was then the outskirts of Shanghai. Survivors of Lunghua were released in August 1945.\n\nAmongst all this, Shanghai was notable for a long period as the only place in the world that unconditionally offered refuge for Jews escaping from the Nazis. These refugees often lived in squalid conditions in an area known as the Shanghai Ghetto in Hongkew. On 21 August 1941 the Japanese government closed Hongkew to Jewish immigration.\n\nIn February 1943, the International Settlement was \"de jure\" returned to the Chinese as part of the British–Chinese Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China and American–Chinese Treaty for Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China with the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek. However, because Shanghai was under Japanese control, this was unenforceable. In reply, in July 1943, the Japanese retroceded the SMC to the City Government of Shanghai, which was then in the hands of the pro-Japanese Wang Jingwei Government.\n\nAlthough the original treaty between Britain and China (the Treaty of Nanking) was signed in 1842 on behalf of the entire British Empire, the new treaty of 1943 was only signed on behalf of the United Kingdom, colonies and British India. It was not signed on behalf of the dominions. Canada signed its own treaty with China the following year.\n\nAfter the war and the liberation of the city from the Japanese, a Liquidation Commission fitfully met to discuss the remaining details of the handover. By the end of 1945, most westerners not actively involved in the Chinese Civil War (such as intelligence agents, soldiers, journalists etc.) or in Shanghai's remaining foreign businesses, had left the city. With the defeat of the Kuomintang in 1949, the city was occupied by Communist troops and came under the control of Mayor of Shanghai.\n\nThe foreign architecture of the International Settlement era can still be seen today along the Bund and in many locations around the city.\n\nThe International Settlement did not have a unified legal system. The Municipal Council issued Land Regulations and regulations under this, that were binding on all people in the settlement. Other than this, citizens and subjects of powers that had treaties with China that provided for extraterritorial rights were subject to the laws of their own countries and civil and criminal complaints against them were required to be brought against them to their consular courts (courts overseen by consular officials) under the laws of their own countries.\n\nThe number of treaty powers had climbed to a maximum of 19 by 1918 but was down to 14 by the 1930s: Great Britain, the United States, Japan, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Peru, Mexico, and Switzerland. Germany and Austria-Hungary lost their treaty rights after WWI, and Russia gave up her rights as a matter of political expediency. Belgium was declared by China to have lost her rights in 1927. Furthermore, the Chinese government adamantly refused to grant treaty power status to any of the new nations born in the wake of WWI, such as Austria and Hungary (formerly Austria-Hungary), Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Baltic States and Finland.\n\nChinese citizens and citizens of non-treaty powers were subject to Chinese law. Inside the Settlement, cases against them would be brought to the Mixed Court, a court established in the Settlement in the 1870s which existed until 1926. In cases involving foreigners, a foreign assessor, usually a consular officer, would sit with the Chinese magistrate and in many cases acted like a judge. In 1927, a Provisional Court was established with a sole Chinese judge presiding. In 1930, Chinese Special Courts were established which had jurisdiction over all non treaty power individuals and companies in the Settlement.\n\nTwo countries, Britain and the United States established formal court systems in China to try cases. The British Supreme Court for China and Japan was established in 1865 and located in its own building in the British Consulate compound and the United States Court for China was established in the US Consulate in 1906. Both courts were occupied by the Japanese on 8 December 1941 and effectively ceased to function from that date.\n\nThe currency situation in China generally was very complicated in the 19th century. There was no unified system. Different parts of China operated different systems, and the Spanish pieces of eight that had been coming from Mexico for a few hundred years on Manila Galleons were current along the China coast. Until the 1840s these silver dollar coins were Spanish coins minted mainly in Mexico City, but from the 1840s these gave way to Mexican republican dollars.\n\nIn Shanghai, this complexity represented a microcosm of the complicated economy existing elsewhere along the China coast. The Chinese reckoned in weights of silver, which did not necessarily correspond to circulating coins. One important unit was a tael, a measurement of weight with several different definitions. These included: Customs Taels (for foreign trade), Cotton Taels (for cotton trade), etc. Shanghai had its own tael, which was very similar in weight to the Customs Tael and therefore popular for international business. China also had a mixture of coins, including Chinese Copper Cash coins and Mexican dollars. Paper money was first issued by European and North American colonial banks (one British colonial bank known as the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China at one time issued banknotes in Shanghai that were denominated in Mexican dollars).\n\nEuropean and North American currencies did not officially circulate in the International Settlement, except Yen in the Japanese district of \"Little Tokyo\". Until the year 1873, however, US dollar coins would have reasonably corresponded in size, shape and value to Mexican dollars. Between 1873 and 1900, all silver standard dollars had depreciated to about 50% of the value of the gold standard dollars of the United States and Canada leading to a rising economic depression.\n\nThe Chinese themselves officially adopted the dollar unit as their national currency in 1889, and the first Chinese dollar coins, known as yuan, contained an inscription which related their value to an already existing Chinese system of accounts. On the earliest Chinese dollar (yuan) coins it states the words 7 mace and 2 candareens. The mace and candareen were sub-divisions of the tael unit of weight. Banknotes tended to be issued in dollars, either worded as such or as yuan.\n\nDespite the complications arising from a mixture of Chinese and Spanish coinages, there was one overwhelming unifying factor binding all the systems in use: silver. The Chinese reckoned purely in terms of silver, and value was always compared against a weight of silver (hence, the reason large prices were given in tael). It was the strict adherence of the Chinese to silver that caused China and even the British colonies of Hong Kong and Weihaiwei to remain on the silver standard after the rest of the world had changed over to the gold standard. When China began producing official Republican yuan coins in 1934, they were minted in Shanghai and shipped to Nanking for distribution.\n\nShanghai had developed a postal service as early as the Ming Dynasty, but during the treaty port era foreign postal services were organised through their respective consulates. For example, the United States Post Office Department maintained a United States Postal Agency at the Shanghai consulate through which Americans could use the US Post Office to send mail to and from the US mainland and US territories. Starting in 1919 the 16 current regular US stamps were overprinted for use in Shanghai with the city's name, \"China\", and amounts double their printed face values. In 1922 texts for two of the overprints were changed, thereby completing the Scott catalogue set of K1-18, \"Offices in China\".\n\nThe British originally used British postage stamps overprinted with the local currency amount, but from 1868, the British changed to Hong Kong postage stamps already denominated in dollars. However, in the special case of Shanghai, in the year 1865 the International settlement began to issue its own postage stamps, denominated in the local Shanghai tael unit.\n\nThe Shanghai Post Office controlled all post within the Settlement, but post coming in or going out of the treaty port was required to go through the Chinese Imperial Post Office. In 1922 the various foreign postal services, the Shanghai Post Office and the Chinese Post Office were all brought together into a single Chinese Post Office, thus extending the 1914 membership of the Chinese Post Office to the Universal Postal Union to Shanghai Post Office. Some other foreign countries refused to fall under this new postal service's remit, however: for many years, Japan was notable as sending almost all its mail to Shanghai in diplomatic bags, which could not be opened by postal staff.\n\nThe General Shanghai Post Office was first located on Beijing Road and moved to the location on Sichuan North Road of the General Post Office Building, Shanghai that is today the Shanghai Post Museum.\n\nInternational merchants brought with them amateur musical talent that manifested in the creation of the Shanghai Philharmonic Society in 1868 under the baton of French conductor Remusat. To remain under the instruction of Remusat, the society offered him the profits of two concerts a year, which was a reasonable deal considering the popularity of their concerts throughout the year. From here, the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra was officially formed in 1879, also under Remusat.\n\nIn 1919, the orchestra came under Italian pianist Marco Paci, and it flourished as a main cultural attraction for the public. In an interview regarding the orchestra in 1933, Paci noted that the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra was \"now one of the finest symphonic orchestras in the world, comparable, if not superior to any in Europe or America.\" He also discussed the wide audience to which the symphony performed, including the fact that the Shanghai concert audience included people of various nationalities who had a wide spectrum of pieces and composers that they enjoyed. As a result, the orchestra performed a great selection of pieces, from Beethoven to lesser-known composers such as Bargiel. Internationally noted musicians such as Polish pianist Ignez Friedman visited Shanghai to give guest performances.\n\nIn 1938, the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra faced disbandment as the ratepayers in the annual Municipal Council meeting considered reallocating budgets away from the orchestra, since it was \"western and unnecessary.\" However, after much discussion, they decided to keep the orchestra, acknowledging that its educational value was much greater than the cost of keeping it up. The Shanghai Municipal Orchestra had the financial and verbal backing of many other larger countries, including Italy, who donated 50,000 lire to the orchestra, the France Council, who acted as a defending argument for the maintenance of the orchestra, and Japan, whose Viscount Konoye, encouraged the Japanese people to support the orchestra and the culture that it brought to the East.\n\nAfter 1938, there were several other times during which the Municipal wanted to kill off the orchestra; however, every time, the orchestra had \"phoenix-like risen from the ashes.\" Further on in the article, the editor notes the great educational values of music in bring culture to the East, which was a characteristic of music unique to Shanghai. Additionally, unlike other places in the world, Shanghailanders had a consistently great genuine appreciation for music, which was a common language that brought people of all nations together in celebration.\n\nThe people in the International Settlement prided themselves in the high culture that they had even while separated ten thousand miles from home, physically manifested in the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra. After every performance, an article was released in the \"Amusements\" section of the newspaper, outlining the concert program, praising the success of each concert, and critiquing the musicians and the orchestra as a whole.\n\nIn addition to the string orchestra, opera and choral music were favoured forms of entertainment. Often, the orchestra would accompany singers as a part of orchestra concerts, in addition to the symphonies and other pieces that they played, or just in choral or opera concerts.\n\n\n\nThe French Concession was governed by a separate municipal council, under the direction of the Consul General. The French Concession was not part of the International Settlement.\n\n\n"}

After the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) declared the existence of a Palestinian state in 1988, some settler activists (primarily Kahanists) feared that international pressure would lead Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and sought to lay the groundwork for an Orthodox Jewish state in the West Bank if this came to pass. The establishment of this state was announced in a Jerusalem hotel on December 27. Veteran Kahanist, Michael Ben-Horin, was declared president of the state of Judea. In January 1989 several hundred activists met and announced their intention to create such a state if Israel withdrew. \n\nThe idea was revived following the unilateral disengagement plan which resulted in the forcible withdrawal of Jewish settlers from Gaza by the Israeli Defense Force in 2005. In 2007 Rabbi Shalom Dov Wolpo suggested the establishment of a new state in the West Bank in the event of Israeli withdrawal.\n\nThe flag of Judea is very similar to the flag of Israel. Like the flag of Israel, it depicts a blue symbol on a white background, between two horizontal blue stripes, but unlike the flag of Israel the symbol is a Menorah instead of a Star of David. Another version features a Star of David of a different sort than appears on the flag of Israel, together with some other symbols.\n"}
