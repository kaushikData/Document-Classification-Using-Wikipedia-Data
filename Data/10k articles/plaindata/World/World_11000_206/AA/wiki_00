After World War I the disbandment of the Civic Guard led to a suggestion that a separate mounted ceremonial unit be established but the proposal was left in abeyance until the Belgian cavalry was mechanized in 1938. Accordingly in that year a permanent Royal Escort was created as part of the Gendarmerie. The full dress uniform of bearskin, black tunic and white breeches then adopted, and still worn, had been that of the mounted gendarmerie prior to 1914.\n\nThe cavalry unit of the General Reserve of the Federal Police is responsible for providing the escort.

Often he meddles with woodsmen, delays their transports, and tips loads of timber over. He often interferes with men in other ways and is accused of all sorts of mischief. The Bys often appears as a stump or an insignificant, little, grey man. Sometimes he wears a red, woven cap and an axe, because one of his tasks is to cut down Gotland's forest. This goes slowly however and sometimes only one tree per century is felled. It's said the Bys is a humanoid who has done some crime within his lifetime, and is therefore sentenced to wander the earth forever. The Bys is also the ward of the forest and nature.\n\nSimilar to a Deildegast, some sources say that the Bysar are deceased people who have cheated other men out of their land by moving the markers that separated two holdings. As punishment they get no peace in the grave, and are doomed to go along the faulty border, moving the sticks which stand on the wrong land. It's said that as they walk you can hear them mumble, \"This is right, this is wrong\" while moving the markers. If a human follows Bysen and moves the wrongly placed sticks to the right places then Bysen will gain peace. On the Swedish mainland the counterpart to Bysen is called \"skälvrängare\" or \"osaliga lantmätare\" (approximately: \"unholy landsurveyor\").\n\nIf Bysen catches sight of you where you are in the forest he will enchant your vision so that you can not find him again.

He was said to have ruled Dagbon for only seven weeks in 1899 but played an important role in the Dagbon chieftaincy conflict.\n\nBefore Na Andani died in 1899, he had advised his children to let Na Allassani of Karaga, who was the first son of his predecessor Na Abudu, be the next king Ya-Na, and for his own eldest son, Tugulan Yiri to fill the now-vacant Karaga chieftaincy. But when he died, his eldest son Tugulan Yiri rejected this, and instead asked that the Savelugu chief Dahamani (Darimani Kukra Adjei) become the next Ya-Na. He would then become chief of Savelugu instead of Karaga. The system of rotation offered by the deceased chief was not respected and the kingmakers, relying on soothsaying and/or by frenzied dancing to the personal whims of Tugu Lana Yiri (Tuguna Yiri) bid his request and made Kukaridjei (the chief of Savelugu) the Ya Na. Tamakloe (1931:43) sympathises with the elders of Dagbon when he said that “the elders reluctantly did what was asked of them.” Infuriated, Allassani sought help from the German colonial administration in Sansan Mangu (in modern Togo) who came, dethroned the Andani usurpers and made Allasani king. Thus, Darimani was king for only seven weeks in the Gbewaa Palace (i.e. installed him as Ya-Na).\n\nThe Palace was burnt down by Darimani during the German siege to prevent Na Allassani from occupying it, claiming Na Andani (their patron) built it and the Abudus should build their own palace as well for their Ya Na. Na Alassani thus built the Gbewaa Palace about a hundred metres away; it has been the palace for all subsequent Ya Nas until it was burnt down in the 2002 conflict. As of 2013, a temporal palace is being built on the ruins of the old palace burnt by the Andanis in 1899.\n\nThe importance of the seven weeks of Darimani's kingship is that it disrupted the established principle of rotation between the descendants of the Abudu and Andanis and sowed the seeds of deep mistrust. It was the very first major encounter between the Abudu Gate and the Andani Gate.. \n\n___ (2008). \"Politicization, Elite Manipulation or Instituitonal Weaknesses?

It was adopted as the national anthem on September 8, 1921, which is also the national day of Andorra. The lyrics make reference to several key aspects of Andorran culture and history, such as the heritage of the Carolingian Empire.\n\n\"El Gran Carlemany\" was composed by Enric Marfany Bons (1871–1942), who was a priest. The lyrics to the song were penned by Juan Benlloch i Vivó (1864–1926), who served as the Bishop of Urgell from 1906 to 1919. This position also made him an \"ex officio\" Co–Prince of Andorra. The song was officially designated as the country's national anthem on September 8, 1921, when it was sung at the country's cathedral for the first time. The day it was adopted – September 8 – is the National Day of Andorra. This coincides with the feast day of Our Lady of Meritxell, the country's patron saint who is mentioned in the lyrics.\n\nThe lyrics of \"El Gran Carlemany\" give a short account of Andorra's history \"in a first-person narrative\". It recounts the traditional Andorran legend that Charlemagne reconquered the region from the Moors between 788 and 790, after the Catalan people had guided his army through the rugged valleys, which Charlemagne compensated with granting Andorra its independence, and its first borders were delineated that same year. It formed part of the \"Marca Hispanica\", a buffer zone formed by Charlemagne in order to protect his state (the Carolingian Empire). According to legend, he was responsible for restructuring the country, reintroducing Christianity to its people and overseeing the construction of monasteries. Because of these accomplishments, he was given \"a mythical aura\" and is regarded as the founder of Andorra. The hymn begins with \"El gran Carlemany mon pare\" (\"Great Charlemagne my father\"), and memorializes this view and celebrates the country's status as \"the only remaining daughter of the Carolingian empire,\" since it is the only remnant of the Marca Hispanica.\n\n"}

The current design of the flag depicts three Saint Andrew's Crosses and is based on the escutcheon in the coat of arms of Amsterdam.\n\nDesign journalist Roman Mars declared it during a TED Talk in 2015 to be the most \"badass\" city flag in the world, as well as an example to others. He particularly praised the simplicity and popular appeal that led to its widespread use.\n\nThe colours of the flag are derived primarily from the shield of Amsterdam's coat of arms. According to the city government, its origin could go back to the coat of arms of the Persijn family, which once owned a large tract of land in the capital. These colors, as well as the crosses, are to be seen in the flags of both Ouder-Amstel and Amstelveen.\n\nThe popular legend that the three Saint Andrew's crosses were meant to ward off fire, floods and the black plague is unfounded as the use of three St. Andrews crosses by noble families in the area precedes the arrival of the Black Death in Europe.\n\nIn the coats of arms of two other Dutch cities, Dordrecht and Delft, the middle stripe symbolises water. In regards to Amsterdam, this black strip becomes the River Amstel. This could be why other references state that the three crosses represent three fordable places in the river Amstel.\n\nThe flag was officially adopted on February 5, 1975 although it was already before this date, seen for example on the cover of the day program of the 1928 Summer Olympics held in Amsterdam. Before its official adoption there was also an unofficial use of a flag with the cities coat of arms in the middle of a red-white-black horizontal tricolor. Such a design was already in use in the 17th century, but in Amsterdam history, other designs in the colors red, black and white were also used. Sometimes the three St. Andrew crosses were placed in the white orbit of the red-white-blue Dutch national flag.\n\nAFC Ajax, an Amsterdam-based football team who plays in the Dutch Eredivisie, uses the Amsterdam flag as their captain's armband.\n"}

This is because Kiruna had become a prominent settler town by the end of the 19th century, with immigrants flocking to it from across the country.\n\nA characteristic trait of the dialect is the word \"jo\" (\"yes\", especially after a negative question or in quick conversation), pronounced approximately as [] (found in many places in northern Norrland). This is not always used, however, and is only pronounced with ingressive airflow. Another distinctive trait of the Kiruna dialect is a heavy alveolar trill.\n\nThe Kiruna dialect is fairly commonly spoken in comparison to more endangered North Swedish dialects such as the genuine dialects of Norrbotten and Westrobothnia Lower Luleå dialect and the Lower Kalix dialect. Unlike these dialects, the Kiruna dialect does not drop word endings. The Kiruna dialect is not a genuine dialect but standard Swedish with mixed regional influences, this is in contrast to the genuine Nordic dialects spoken in the coast of Norrbotten (Piteå, Luleå and Kalix) that form a part of the Westrobothnian dialect continuum that differ from standard Swedish to the extent of not being mutually intelligible without prior knowledge.\n\n"}

The paper is written in French peppered with loan words from Cameroonian Pidgin English. In 1999, it had a weekly circulation of 4,000 copies. On 4 January 1999, Cameroonian police confiscated from 2,000 to 2,500 copies of \"Mamy-Wata\" in Douala. La Nouvelle Expression reported that the papers were taken in response to a cartoon in the 29 December issue that depicted Cameroon's president, Paul Biya, in a spat with his wife. Reports differ on whether the police ever provided an official justification for the seizure; the Committee to Protect Journalists reported that none was provided, but the International Press Institute reported that authorities claimed the newspapers were a \"breach of public order\". Scholar George Echu has claimed that the incident added \"Mamy-Wata\" to \"the pantheon of Africa's satirical heavyweights.\"\n\n"}

The novel was released, with a few modifications, in June 1909.\n\nArsène Lupin is opposed this time by Isidore Beautrelet, a young but gifted amateur detective, who is still in high school but who is poised to give Arsène Lupin a big headache. In the Arsène Lupin universe, the Hollow Needle is the second secret of Marie Antoinette and Alessandro Cagliostro, the hidden fortune of the kings of France, as revealed to Arsène Lupin by Josephine Balsamo in the novel \"The Countess of Cagliostro\" (1924). The Mystery of the Hollow Needle hides a secret that the Kings of France have been handing down since the time of Julius Caesar... and now Arsène Lupin has mastered it. The legendary needle contains the most fabulous treasure ever imagined, a collection of queens' dowries, pearls, rubies, sapphires and diamonds... the fortune of the kings of France.\n\nWhen Isidore Beautrelet discovers the Château de l'Aiguille in the department of Creuse, he thinks that he has found the solution to the riddle (\"l'Aiguille Creuse\" being French for \"The Hollow Needle\", and also the French title of the novel). However, he did not realize that the château was built by Louis XIV, the king of France, to put people off the track of a needle in Normandy, near the town of Le Havre, where Arsène Lupin, known also under the name of Louis Valméras, has hidden himself.\n\nA direct sequel to this novel, featuring Lupin against La Griffe, is the novel \"Le second visage d'Arsène Lupin\" by Boileau-Narcejac in 1975.\n\n\n"}
