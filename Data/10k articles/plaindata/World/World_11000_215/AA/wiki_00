The neck is attached to the inside of the box, exits through a small round opening on the membrane, and curves upward for about 60 to 70 cm. Seven or eight strings are attached to a piece of wood inside the box, and extend through the skin to tuning pegs inserted along the neck.

This implied a radical populism that would threaten the allegiance of the people of Liechtenstein to ruling Prince Franz Josef II. \n\nIn March 1939, the VDBL staged an amateurish coup attempt, first trying to provoke a German intervention by burning swastikas, followed by declaring an \"Anschluß\" with Germany. The leaders were almost immediately arrested and the hoped-for German invasion failed to materialise. \n\nThe inability of the party to participate in the 1939 elections (after a pact between the main parties to keep the election date a secret), combined with the drastic decrease in Nazi sympathies following the outbreak of World War II led to a temporary demise of the party. However, in June 1940 it was reconstituted under the leadership of Dr. Alfons Goop. During 1941 and 1942, the party was involved in vehement anti-Semitic agitation, urging a solution to the country's presumed \"Jewish Question\", accusing Jewish families in Liechtenstein of spying for the Allies. By early 1943, the VDBL had become an embarrassment to Germany: its recruitment for the Waffen-SS compromised Liechtenstein's neutrality, disquieting the Swiss. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in March 1943 forced the VDBL to hold talks with the Patriotic Union (VU), in Friedrichshafen under auspices of the Waffen-SS, in order to reach a fusion of both parties, which shared an anti-Bolshevik and anti-clerical programme. Severely disappointed, Goop resigned as party leader. In the end the VU only consented to some \"cultural cooperation\". When Germany's war fortunes declined, in July 1943 \"Der Umbruch\" was forbidden by the authorities. In 1946, party leaders were prosecuted for the 1939 coup attempt. Goop was in 1947 condemned for high treason, to an imprisonment of thirty months.\n"}

The premise of the day is to raise awareness of the fact that women around the world are subject to rape, domestic violence and other forms of violence; furthermore, one of the aims of the day is to highlight that the scale and true nature of the issue is often hidden. For 2014, the official Theme framed by the UN Secretary-General’s campaign UNiTE to End Violence against Women, is \"Orange your Neighbourhood\".\n\nHistorically, the date is based on the date of the 1960 assassination of the three Mirabal sisters, political activists in the Dominican Republic; the killings were ordered by Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo (1930–1961). In 1981, activists at the Latin American and Caribbean Feminist Encuentros marked November 25 as a day to combat and raise awareness of violence against women more broadly; on December 17, 1999, the date received its official United Nations (UN) resolution.\n\nThe UN and the Inter-Parliamentary Union have encouraged governments, international organizations and NGOs to organize activities to support the day as an international observance. For example, UN Women (the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women) observes the day each year and offers suggestions for other organizations to observe it. For 2014, the focus is on how violence cuts across all 12 of the critical areas of concern of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which turns 20 next year.\n\nIn her message for 25 November 2014, UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said:\n\nIn 1995, close to 20 years ago, 189 governments came together in Beijing. They adopted a Platform for Action that spelled out key strategies to end violence against women, empower women, and achieve gender equality. ... The promises from 20 years ago are still valid today. Together we must make 2015 the year that marks the beginning of the end of gender inequality. Now is the time for action.\n\nIn his message on the day in 2013, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated:\nI welcome the chorus of voices calling for an end to the violence that affects an estimated one in three women in her lifetime. I applaud leaders who are helping to enact and enforce laws and change mindsets. And I pay tribute to all those heroes around the world who help victims to heal and to become agents of change.\n\nIn Australia a campaign has formed around International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.\n\nMarches attracted hundreds of participants in Bogota, Paris, and Rome. Thousands marched in San José, Costa Rica and Lima. Over 1,000 Turkish protesters turned out for a banned march in Istanbul; police cut off the end of the march and dispersed the marchers peacefully.\nAccording to the organizers, around 150 thousand of participants in Rome for the third \"Non Una Di Meno\" (Italian chapter of Ni Una Menos association) march for the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and against Pillon decree, which took place from Piazza della Repubblica to Piazza San Giovanni. Among the participants, the former president of the Chamber of Deputies, Laura Boldrini. \n\nA March 2013 article on \"The Conversation\" online media outlet featured an article entitled \"Ending violence against women is good for everyone\" in relation to the observance of International Women's Day on that year. The article claimed that, while a general Australian belief exists that violence against Australian women is less severe in comparison to other nations, the Australian Bureau of Statistics had revealed in a report that \"one in three Australian women will experience physical violence in their lifetime, while 23% to 28% will experience sexual or emotional harm.\" The statistics were taken from a report, published in 2005 (reissue), entitled \"Personal Safety Survey Australia\".\n\nThe Conversation article by Linda Murray and Lesley Pruitt then provided further Australia-specific data: \"Violence is the leading cause of death, illness and disability for Australian women aged 15 to 44. It’s responsible for more illness and premature death than any other preventable cause, such as hypertension, obesity, or smoking.\" The article refers to \"The National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022\" that was published by the Australian government in September 2012—the foreword of the Plan states:\nThe National Plan sets out a framework for action over the next 12 years. This plan shows Australia’s commitments to upholding the human rights of Australian women through the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Declaration to End Violence Against\nWomen and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.\n\nIn September 2014, Australia's VicHealth released the results of the National Community Attitudes towards Violence Against Women Survey. This was the third of a series of such surveys, the first dating from 1995, and the second from 2009. The information was gathered by telephone interviews with over 17,500 Australian men and women aged over 16 years, and indicated a continuing need for future prevention activity.\n\nThe latest data from the Italian Institute of Statistics point out that, in 2017, more than 49 thousand women asked for help to the anti-violence centers (63.7% with children, almost of them minors and 27% foreign citizen). And of these, more than 29 thousand have started a journey out of violence.\n\nThe date of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women also marks the start of the \"16 Days of Activism\" that precedes Human Rights Day on December 10 each year.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2605340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2605340", "title": "Pornography in Europe", "text": "Pornography in Europe\n\nPornography in Europe has been dominated by a few pan-European producers and distributors, the most notable of which is the Private Media Group that successfully claimed the position previously held by Color Climax Corporation in the early 1990s. Most European countries also have local pornography producers, from Portugal (e.g. \"Naturalvideo\") to Serbia (e.g. \"Hexor\"), who face varying levels of competition with international producers. The legal status of pornography varies widely in Europe; its production and distribution are illegal in countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and Bulgaria, while Hungary is noted for having liberal pornography laws.\n\nIn Albania, pornography is illegal only for producing, delivery, advertising, import, selling and publication of pornographic materials in persons under 18 years old. Child pornography is strictly prohibited.\n\nIn 1990, the \"Federal Act Against Obscene Publications and for the Protection of Youth Morally Endangered\" was passed to regulate pornography in Austria. In 1994 a prohibition on child pornography was added to the law. Under these regulations the minimum age for buying softcore pornography in Austria is 16 and the minimum age for buying hardcore pornography is 18. Publication for profit of violent pornography or material depicting bestiality is illegal under the regulations, but possession and non-commercial exchanges of these types of pornography are legal.\n\nPornography is illegal in Belarus. Production, distribution, promotion, exhibition as well as possession with intent of distribution or promotion of pornographic materials or objects of pornographic nature is punished by Belarusian criminal law and results in compulsory community service, fine or up to 4 years imprisonment.\n\nPornography is legal in Belgium. Pornographic products, mainly magazines and DVDs, are typically imported from the 3 neighbouring European countries of France, Germany, and the Netherlands, or from North America. There is also a little local production, mostly amateur.\n\nIn the People's Republic of Bulgaria (1946–1990) pornography was only available to a comparatively limited number of people. What pornographic materials there were (mostly magazines and videocassettes) were smuggled into the country. The abandonment of censorship in the early post-communist period resulted in pornography becoming widely available. In the early 1990s pornographic magazines were sold at newsstands, pirated foreign pornographic videocassettes became available and foreign pornographic television stations were accessible. The first Bulgarian pornographic film was made in 1992.\n\nThe production and distribution of pornography is illegal in Bulgaria. The filming of pornography and the online distribution of sexual content are illegal. There are no Bulgarian pornographic production companies. Accessing, possessing or storing pornographic materials is not illegal (except for child pornography).\n\nThe penalty for production or distribution of pornography is up to one year imprisonment (or up to two years if the criminal used the Internet) and a fine of to . The penalty for distribution or possession of child pornography is up to one year imprisonment or a fine of up to . Authorities tolerate illegal distribution of hardcore porn in designated shops, and on TV after 11 pm. Softcore material is rarely censored. Magazines and pornographic papers have become increasingly available since the fall of communism in 1989, and local editions of many international porn magazines are published. Society is often exposed to sexual content in advertising.\n\nPornography is legal in Croatia. Hardcore pornographic material may not be sold to persons under the age of 18. Distribution or possession of child pornography is illegal and punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.\n\nPornography is legal in Cyprus. Selling pornographic material to people under 18 years old is illegal. Child pornography is strictly illegal.\n\nPornography in the Czech Republic was legalized in 1993 following the Velvet Revolution, when the country ceased to be a communist state and returned to liberal democracy. Among the Czech companies that produce pornography are LegalPorno Studios, based in Prague. Currently the pornography industry represents more than 1% of the Czech Republic's national income.\n\nThe sale and distribution of child pornography is illegal and is punishable by imprisonment for up to 3 years. Possession of child pornography was made illegal in 2007 and carries a penalty of up to 2 years in prison. The Czech penal code also bans the sale and distribution of pornography depicting sexual intercourse with an animal and pornography depicting violence or disrespect to human beings, with a penalty of up to 1 year in prison.\n\nA ban on pornographic literature was lifted in 1967. In 1969, Denmark became the first country in the world to legalize pornography. People in Denmark have free access to pornography. Pornography including minors younger than 18 years is prohibited, and possession of the same is also illegal.\n\nPornography is legal, distribution or production is regulated by law.\n\nIn Finland, child, violent, and bestial pornography is banned. It is legal to sell pornography in any store, but magazines may not be sold to buyers less than 15 years of age, and hardcore is restricted to buyers aged at least 18.\n\nPrior to 1 January 1999, all indecent publishing, including the import and export thereof, was banned.\n\nIn 1976, a law that put considerable sanctions on pornographic films in distribution and taxation, known popularly as \"Code X\" was imposed, creating a situation that led pornography to develop itself on its own right. Since then, pornography has been a growing economy in France, now existing in various forms from magazines to satellite TV broadcasting.\n\nIn the early years of German pornography began with the softcore film \"Graf Porno und seine Mädchen\" (Count Porno and his girls) in 1968. The movie's success (more than 3 million admissions) lead to a whole series of films that was and is referred to in German media as the \"Sex-Welle\" (sex wave). The most well known film of this period is \"Schulmädchen-Report: Was Eltern nicht für möglich halten\" (The School-Girl Report, what the parents don't believe possible) by Ernst Hofbauer in 1970. The sex scenes had become bolder with time and by 1975, when the legal ban of pornography was lifted, the era of German hardcore pornography began.\n\nDirector Hans Billian was the protagonist of the period and the films were usually in line with the so-called \"Bavarian porn sex comedies\", often depicting male performers as comic characters, like Sepp Gneißl in \"Kasimir der Kuckuckskleber\" (1977). This era was also characterised by several Josephine Mutzenbacher films.\n\nToday's German pornography is generally very similar to the American \"glamour\" pornography though often tailored primarily for the German market. In contrast several German labels focus on a more \"home-made\" amateur flair, often focusing on intense hardcore themes such as gang bangs, bukkake and urine fetishism; most notably 'German Goo Girls' and other series by John Thompson Productions.\n\nDue to popular belief outside of Germany, fecal pornography known as \"Scheisse porn\" (using the German slang word for faeces) or, more commonly, as \"Kaviar\" (a generic term) supposedly is particularly popular in Germany, with companies like \"SG-Video\" and performers like Austrian Veronica Moser and Simon Thaur or English Ben Chambers specializing in the concept. Although German companies have their fair world market share in producing for this niche market, the major percentage is sold into export.\n\nMindGeek's age-verification software AgeID, which is used to verify the ages of users of pornographic Internet websites, has been in use in Germany since 2015.\n\nIn Greece, selling pornographic material to people under 18 years old is illegal, but in practice the law is not always enforced. Since 2008 there is also a legal little local production. Child pornography is strictly illegal.\n\nIn Hungary, the production of pornography mainly dates from the period after the fall of communism in 1989. The production and distribution of pornography was illegal under communism, but the laws were liberalised with the emergence of democracy. Permissive government policies soon propelled the country to the forefront of the European pornography industry. Several foreign directors were attracted to the country's liberal legislation, cheap production costs and large supply of attractive female performers. Eventually, domestic producers began to prosper as well, and several female actresses made big names for themselves within the industry. Hungarian pornography is different from that produced in America in the more natural appearance of its performers. The sex scenes also tend to be more extreme, with frequent use of anal sex and various forms of multiple penetration.\n\nPublication of pornography is illegal in Iceland, and is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to 6 months. Publication of child pornography is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to 2 years. In 2013 the Icelandic government proposed banning violent Internet pornography and Iceland's parliament began debating a ban on online pornography.\n\nOther than regulations regarding pornographic movies, no laws against pornography, other than child pornography (a child is defined as someone under 18), exist.\n\nAlthough Italy had accumulated a lot of softcore pornography in the 1970s, hardcore pornography was not a usual trend until the 1980s. The first pornographic film in Italy was \"Il Telefono rosso\" (The red telephone) in 1983 by Riccardo Schicchi with Ilona Staller (aka \"Cicciolina\"). The film caused much controversy and it was restrained from legal release until 1986 with an alternate revision of Italian censorship laws.\n\nIn Latvia, the distribution of pornographic material is allowed under very similar legal conditions as in Poland. Pornographic or erotic material is rarely to never sold in places accessible to general public.\n\nIn Lithuania, commercial distribution of pornographic material is prohibited by the Article 309 of the country's Criminal Code which states that \"A person who, for the purpose of distribution, produces or acquires pornographic material or distributes such material shall be punished by community service or by a fine or by restriction of liberty or by imprisonment for a term of up to one year\".\n\nIn Malta, pornography and obscene material was outlawed until later 2016, regardless of whether it has a commercial interest or whether it is directed to an adult audience. The relevant law in this respect was Article 208 (1) of the Criminal Code of Malta which prohibited the manufacture, print, importation, circulation and exportation of pornographic or obscene print, painting, photograph, film, book, card or writing, or any other obscene article whatsoever, whether for gain, or for distribution, or for display in a public place. In a decision given on 21 February 2011, the Maltese Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the criminal conviction of Mr. Alexander Baldacchino who was found guilty of exhibiting soft and hardcore pornographic films at the City Lights Theatre in Valletta. In another judgement, student editor Mark Camilleri and author Alex Vella Gera were found not guilty under Article 208 (1) of the Criminal Code and Article 7 of the Press Act (obscene libel) for the publication of an obscene story entitled \"Li Tkisser Sewwi\" (translated in English to 'Repair that which you break') in student newspaper \"Realtà\" (distributed for free on campus at the University of Malta) by the Court of Magistrates (Malta). The decision was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeal.\n\nIn 2015 the Minister of Social Justice Owen Bonnici started to work on legislation to allow both services or art to create pornographic material while also giving official right to access pornographic material. By late 2016 the parliament of Malta gave the green light for most pornographic material. Pornography involving minors, disabled and extreme forms of expression, including threats with the use of such material, remain illegal.\n\n\nIn Norway, hardcore material was illegal until 2006 de jure to distribute, or sell, but legal to possess. Production, however, was not explicitly illegal, thus both photo and movie shoots occurred. One could acquire pornography abroad, on the Internet, or via satellite TV. Illegal porn shops also existed, especially in larger cities. To satisfy legal requirements, editors of erotic magazines, domestic TV channels, and cable TV obscured \"sexual organs in activity\" using black rectangles and the like. After the Supreme Court of Norway unanimously acquitted a former magazine editor on 7 December 2005 for publishing unobscured hardcore pornography in 2002, it became understood that printed hardcore pornography was no longer illegal. Pornography became legal on March 14th, 2006. Regular and cable TV tend to abide by the old standards, seeing that edited TV is regulated by a separate law and thus is not affected by the Supreme Court decision. Video-on-demand, however, is not regulated by the TV laws, and, thus, pornography is legal to order.\n\nThe depiction of illegal sexual activities, including those involving children, animals, necrophilia, rape, violence, or the use of force, remains illegal. \n\nIn Poland, as of September 1998, Article 202 of the national Penal Code makes pornography legal except for the production or possession of pornographic materials containing minors, bestiality (zoophilia), and \"scenes of violence/rape\". Also illegal is presenting or showing pornographic materials to people who do not want to have any contact with them, and to persons under 15 years of age.\n\nIn Portugal, hardcore pornographic movies can only be shown in adult cinemas. Videos and magazines are openly sold in newsstands but are forbidden by law to be supplied to minors under the age of 18 years. Additionally, hardcore pornographic movies are banned from open-channel TV and can only be broadcast through encrypted/pay-per-view channels.\n\nChild pornography (i.e., pornography depicting children or juveniles below the age of 18) is illegal. Although the national age of consent is 14, the age of legal responsibility (i.e., the age a person can sign contracts consenting to appear in pornography) is 18.\n\nPornography is legal in Romania. Magazines must be enclosed in plastic bags (or something equivalent) with a small red square printed on the enclosing material. Pornographic TV channels offered by cable operators must be encrypted. Pornographic materials cannot be sold to minors under 18.\n\nMost Russian pornography is produced in Moscow and in St. Petersburg where the largest adult film producer, \"SP-Company\", is based. The types of Russian adult films may range from gonzo pornography to adaptations of Russian classics (\"Eugene Onegin\" (by Tatiana Taneyeva (2003)), \"The Master and Margarita\" (by Armen Oganezov & Sergei Pryanishnikov (2002)) etc.) and these productions basically aim the domestic market. Much of the pornography is produced for the international internet market.\n\nAccording to Russian law, consumption of pornography is allowed though the production of it is not. The illegal production, distribution, and \"public demonstration\" of pornography is punishable by a 2- to 6-year prison term. Roskomnadzor, the Russian government's media overseer, has the power to order the blocking of pornographic websites. In 2015 the agency required the blocking of the Russian-language version of Pornhub and 10 other pornographic sites on the basis of a court ruling.\n\nPornography is legal in Serbia. Hardcore pornographic material may not be sold to persons under the age of 18. Distribution or possession of child pornography or pornography involving minors (under 18) is illegal and punishable by law.\n\nPornography was illegal in Francoist Spain, although some people travelled to France to see films such as \"Last Tango in Paris\" and some group tours to French X-rated cinemas were organised. The censorship of that period ended in 1977 and the S-rating for films was introduced, allowing films with soft porn elements to be shown in mainstream cinemas. The film genre that arose was known as \"destape\" (undressing) and included popular films such as \"Las eróticas vacaciones de Stela\" (Stela’s Erotic Vacations), \"El mundo maravilloso del sexo\" (The Marvellous World of Sex), \"Trampa sexual\" (Sexual Trap) and \"La orgía\" (The Orgy). The magazine \"Interviú\", founded in 1976, had revealing covers of famous actresses and included nude photographs inside. In 1983 the \"S\" rating was replaced by the more permissive X-rating.\n\nPornography is now legal in Spain, and enforcement of obscenity laws is lax. It is illegal to display pornographic material at newsstands. In many cities and towns there are a big variety of sex shops or erotic shops. E-commerce merchants from all around the world use I.P.S.P. (Internet clearing services) from Spanish banks. The headquarters of Private Media Group, Europe's biggest pornographic company, are in Barcelona.\n\nLike Denmark and the Netherlands, Sweden does not regulate pornography and the country has no age laws for the possession or viewing of pornography. Some shops follow a voluntary limit and do not sell to minors. Material that involves animals is legal, though it is subject to animal-welfare laws. BDSM is classified as an \"illegal depiction of violence\" (\"olaga våldsskildring\").\n\nIt is illegal for people under the age of 18 to act or pose for pornography in Sweden. Pornographic photographs and films depicting children are illegal even if the material was legal in the originating country.\n\nPornography in Switzerland is defined by the Article 197 of the Swiss criminal code. The first alinea states that «\"Any person who offers, shows, passes on or makes accessible to a person who is under the age of 16 pornographic documents, sound or visual recordings, depictions or other articles of a similar nature or pornographic representations, or broadcasts any of the same on radio or television is liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetary penalty.\"» Furthermore, it is illegal to produce, import, store, market, advertise, exhibit, offer, show, pass on or make accessible pornography that depicts sexual acts involving children (under 16 years old) or animals, human excrement, or acts of violence, called \"hard pornography\".\n\nSince July 2014, human excrement and urine are not considered being \"hard pornography\" anymore. Until June 2014, actors aged 16 and above could participate in a pornography production; however, since July 2014, if a person \"looks\" or is under 18 years of age, the material is considered as pedo-pornography. This is due to the Swiss ratification of the Lanzarote Convention.\n\nThe age of viewing pornography stays fixed at 16 years old (Art. 197 al. 1 of the Swiss criminal code).\n\nThe same materials cited above are nevertheless not regarded as pornographic if they have a cultural or scientific value that justifies their protection by law.\n\nTurkey, which is a secular state with a Muslim majority, was the first country to legally produce pornographic materials in the Muslim world. After a long period of producing Italian-inspired softcore comedies in the 1970s, the hardcore film \"Öyle Bir Kadın Ki\" was distributed in 1979.\n\nPornography was outlawed in Ukraine in 2009 when the then president Victor Yushchenko signed new legislation. The law has been overwhelmingly approved by the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament). The possession, distribution, sale and manufacture of pornographic materials are illegal, with laws strictly enforced. Possession of pornographic material can carry a fine or up to 3 years imprisonment. Pornography is defined by the law as \"vulgar, candid, cynical, obscene depiction of sexual acts, pursuing no other goal, the explicit demonstration of genitals, unethical elements of the sexual act, sexual perversions, realistic sketches that do not meet moral criteria and offend honor and dignity of the human by inciting low instincts\". Pornography for \"medical purposes\" remains legal.\n\nWiska, one of Ukraine's internationally known pornstars, alleges continuous and unconstitutional persecution for her work abroad, and has unsuccessfully applied for political asylum in the European Union.\n\n\"In Britain, where pornography is already more restricted than it is anywhere else in the English-speaking world or in Western Europe\", wrote Avedon Carol in 1995, \"sexual media is easily smeared for an audience that is seldom given an opportunity to see what really is sold under the name of 'pornography'\". However the current British legislative framework including the Obscene Publications Act 1959 (in England and Wales), the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 and the Video Recordings Act 1984 leads to a confusing situation in which there is a theoretical ban on the publication and distribution (but not possession) of pornographic material in any form, which is in practice unenforcable due to the vagueness of the legal test of material that \"depraves and corrupts\". In practice, hardcore material on video and DVD was until recently banned by the requirement under the Video Recordings Act to be certified by the BBFC, while mainstream hardcore material in other forms such as magazines and websites is essentially unrestricted. Continental European, American and British hardcore pornographic magazines are now openly sold in many British newsagents, for instance. Due to liberalisation in BBFC policy, mainstream hardcore DVDs now receive R18 certificates, legalising them but restricting their sale to licensed sex shops such as those in Soho.\n\nBritish-made pornography tends to focus on a rough-and-ready semi-amateur look rather than the more stylized glamorous look of Continental European pornography.\n\nThe UK is still the only Member State of the European Union that prohibits private imports of adult pornography by consumers coming from other Member States of the European Union. In the 2004–2005 fiscal year, the agents of Her Majesty Revenue & Customs seized 96,783 items of pornographic media carried by people travelling into the UK.\n\nIn 2005, the UK porn industry was estimated to be worth about £1 billion.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11220016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11220016", "title": "Sky Ireland", "text": "Sky Ireland\n\nSky Ireland Limited is a subsidiary of Comcast-owned Sky and supplies television, internet and telephony services in Ireland.\n\nIts corporate headquarters are in Dublin which were opened by Taoiseach Enda Kenny on 18 January 2013. Sky's broadband services have no cap and are unlimited.\n\nSky Ireland employs around 900 staff in Dublin.\n\n\nWhen Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the Astra 2A satellite which was located at the 28.5°E orbital position, unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from 19.2°E. This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as Eutelsat's Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 28A) at 28.5°E), enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service, Sky, with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels. The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries, while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nNew Astra satellites joined the position in 2000 and 2001, and the number of channels available to customers increased accordingly. This trend continued with the launch of Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 28A) in 2001. Additionally, some channels occasionally received new numbering — However, in early 2006, the majority of channels received new numbering, with some receiving single digit changes, whilst others received new numbers entirely.\n\nSky is currently transmitted from the Astra satellites located at 28.2° east (2A/2C/2E/2F) and Eutelsat's Eutelsat 28A satellite at 28.5°E.\n\nSky's standard definition broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2, with the Sky Movies and Sky Box Office channels including optional Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films, although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box. Sky+ HD material is broadcast using MPEG-4 and most of the HD material uses the DVB-S2 standard. Interactive services and 7-day EPG use the proprietary OpenTV system, with set-top boxes including modems for a return path. Sky News, amongst other channels, provides a pseudo-video on demand interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams.\n\nSky utilises the VideoGuard pay-TV scrambling system owned by NDS, a Cisco Systems company. There are tight controls over use of VideoGuard decoders; they are not available as stand-alone DVB CAMs (conditional-access modules). Sky has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service. The receivers, though designed and built by different manufacturers, must conform to the same user interface look-and-feel as all the others. This extends to the Personal video recorder (PVR) offering (branded Sky+).\n\nSky maintains an electronic programme guide (EPG) which provides information about upcoming programmes and a list of channels. Channels available on Sky are assigned a three digit logical channel number which can be entered on a remote control to access the channel and determines in what order channels are listed.\n\nThe EPG in Ireland gives priority to Irish channels. All channels are grouped into categories depending on their content. What section of the EPG a channel gets allocated is determined by rules set up by Sky Ireland.\n\nSky Ireland has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG. Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28° East is entitled to access to Sky's EPG for a fee. Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries, free carriage on a Sky leased transponder, or actual payment for being carried. However, even in this case, Sky does not carry any control over the channel's content or carriage issues such as picture quality.\n\nIn October 2007, Sky's parent company Sky plc (then BSkyB) announced that they would not accept new applications to launch channel on their EPG, citing \"very significant memory constraints\" on many of its older digiboxes.\n\nIn June 2012, Sky Ireland launched a new EPG for Sky+ HD boxes. The update boasts a new modernised look and improved functionality.\n\nThe Sky EPG lists all channels carried on the Sky platform. Many channels are free, others are available only with a subscription.\n\nChannels on this list are owned by Sky and broadcast adverstising specifically for the Irish market.\n\n\nSome other channels available on the Sky platform also carry Irish advertising, such as the channels provided by Channel 4. \n\nSky subscribers in Ireland have a different choice of channels compared subscribers in the UK, Germany, Austria and Italy. The standard Irish channels RTÉ One, RTÉ One +1, RTÉ Two, RTÉjr, RTÉ News Now, TV3, TG4, 3e and be3 are available to all Irish subscribers. These channels are Videoguarded (not Free-to-air), but are included with any TV package. These channels are also available on Saorview and Saorsat. ITV and the Channel 5 family of channels have to be added manually to Sky boxes in Ireland.\n\nIn February 2013 BSkyB launched its broadband and telephone product in Ireland, and have made significant headway into the Irish market as one of the few providers offering 'triple play' (phone, broadband and digital TV) to the public. As Sky's broadband and phone services use the existing telephone network (LLU and non-LLU) and is widely available as a result. Sky Ireland has offered fibre broadband, using the network of former incumbent, eir, with speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s since 26 December 2014.\n\n\n"}

Slavery was reportedly abolished as a legally recognized institution, including in a 1909 law fully enacted in 1910, although the practice continued until at least 1949.\nThe earliest evidence of slavery in China dates to the Shang dynasty when, by some estimates, approximately 5 percent of the population was enslaved. The Shang dynasty engaged in frequent raids of surrounding states, capturing slaves who would be killed in ritual sacrifices. Scholars disagree as to whether these victims were also used as a source of slave labor.\n\nThe Warring States period saw a decline in slavery, which had been popular in the previous centuries. The slave system had shifted to a feudal system, despite this, slavery was still widespread during the period, despite being on the decline. Since the introduction of private ownership of land in the state of Lu in 594 BC, which brought a system of taxation on private land, and saw the emergence of a system of landlords and peasants, the system of slavery began to decline over the following centuries, as other states followed suit.\n\nThe Qin government confiscated the property and enslaved the families as punishment.\n\nOne of Emperor Gao's first acts was to manumit agricultural workers enslaved during the Warring States period, although domestic servants retained their status.\n\nMen punished with castration during the Han dynasty were also used as slave labor.\n\nDeriving from earlier Legalist laws, the Han dynasty set in place rules that the property and families of criminals doing three years of hard labor or sentenced to castration were to have their families seized and kept as property by the government.\n\nIn the year AD 9, the Emperor Wang Mang usurped the Chinese throne and instituted a series of sweeping reforms, including the abolition of slavery and radical land reform. Slavery was reinstated in AD 12 before his assassination in AD 23\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms period, a number of statuses intermediate between freedom and slavery developed, but none of them are thought to have exceeded 1 percent of the population.\n\nTang law forbade enslaving free people, but allowed enslavement of criminals and foreigners. Free people could however willingly sell themselves. The primary source of slaves came from southern tribe and young slave girls were the most desired on the market. Although various officials such as Kong Kui, the governor of Guangdong, banned the practice, the trade continued. Other peoples sold to Chinese included Turks, Persians, and Korean women, who were sought after by the wealthy. On the silk road slave girls were a major item and much more expensive than silk. Silk was up to five times less than the value of a slave girl. Central Asian slave girls were exported from Central Asia Iranian areas to China. It is believed that the wealthy merchants and aristocratic noblemen of the Chinese capital of Chang'an were the consumers for the huge amount of Central Asian slave women brought by the Sogdians to China to sell to the Chinese. The Central Asian foreign women in the Sogdian owned wineshops in the Chinese capital are also believe to have been slaves since Chinese poets depicted them as homesick, sad and melancholy and they would service travelers by keeping them company overnight. Merchants and literati would frequent the wineshops. The Sogdians reaped massive profits from selling slave girls and so did the Chinese government by taxing the sale of the slaves. Slave girls were one of the major products Chinese bought from Sogdians. Persian poets often wrote about wine and women since the wineservers were often girls and this wine culture with girl servers seems to have spread to China. There were many Sogdian wineshops and Persian shops in Chang'an along with a large slave market. The wineshops were staffed with young girls who served wine to customers and danced for them. Most of the slave girls were 14 or 15 years old. They provided services like sex, dancing, singing, and served wine to their customers in Chang'an as ordered their masters who ran the wineshops. A Sogdian merchant, Kang Weiyi 康尾義 had Indians, Central Asians, and Tokharistanis (Bactrians) among the 15 slave girls he was bringing to sell in the Chinese capital of Chang'an.\n\nThe Song's warfare against northern and western neighbors produced many captives on both sides, but reforms were introduced to ease the transition from bondage to freedom.\n\nThe Yuan dynasty expanded slavery and implemented harsher terms of service. In the process of the Mongols invasion of China proper, many Han Chinese were enslaved by the Mongols rulers. According to Japanese historian Sugiyama Masaaki (杉山正明) and Funada Yoshiyuki (舩田善之), there were also certain number of Mongolian slaves owned by Han Chinese during Yuan. Moreover, there is no evidence that Han Chinese suffered particularly cruel abuse.\n\nKorean girls kept as servants during the Yuan dynasty by \"Northerners\" which was recorded in a historic text. The Caomuzi (草木子) by Ye Ziqi (葉子奇) which was cited by the Jingshi ouji (京師偶記引) by Chai Sang (柴桑) stated that during the Yuan dynasty that Korean girls were a must have property for northerners. (元朝北人，女使必得高麗) Korean women were viewed as having \"jade snow\" like skin (肌膚玉雪發雲霧) by Hao Jingceng 郝經曾, a Yuan scholar, and it was the rage to own Korean women among northerners in the Yuan dynasty as mentioned in Toghon Temür's (shùndì 順帝) Xù Zīzhì Tōngjiàn (續資治通鑒): (京师达官贵人，必得高丽女，然后为名家).\n\nThe Hongwu Emperor sought to abolish all forms of slavery but in practice, slavery continued through the Ming dynasty.\n\nThe Javans sent 300 black slaves as tribute to the Ming dynasty in 1381. When the Ming dynasty crushed the Miao Rebellions in 1460, they castrated 1,565 Miao boys, which resulted in the deaths of 329 of them. They turned the survivors into eunuch slaves. The Guizhou Governor who ordered the castration of the Miao was reprimanded and condemned by Emperor Yingzong of Ming for doing it once the Ming government heard of the event. Since 329 of the boys died, they had to castrate even more. On 30 Jan 1406, the Ming Yongle Emperor expressed horror when the Ryukyuans castrated some of their own children to become eunuchs in order to give them to Yongle. Yongle said that the boys who were castrated were innocent and didn't deserve castration, and he returned the boys to Ryukyu and instructed them not to send eunuchs again.\n\nLater Ming rulers, as a way of limiting slavery because of their inability to prohibit it, passed a decree that limited the number of slaves that could be held per household and extracted a severe tax from slave owners.\n\nThe Qing dynasty initially oversaw an expansion in slavery and states of bondage like the booi aha. They possessed about two million slaves upon their conquest of China. However, like previous dynasties, the Qing rulers soon saw the advantages of phasing out slavery, and gradually introduced reforms turning slaves and serfs into peasants. Laws passed in 1660 and 1681 forbade landowners from selling slaves with the land they farmed and prohibited physical abuse of slaves by landowners. The Kangxi Emperor freed all the Manchu's hereditary slaves in 1685. The Yongzheng Emperor's \"Yongzheng emancipation\" between 1723 and 1730 sought to free all slaves to strengthen his authority through a kind of social leveling that created an undifferentiated class of free subjects under the throne, freeing the vast majority of slaves.\n\nThe abolition of slavery in many countries following the British emancipation led to increasing demands for cheap Chinese laborers, known as \"coolies\". Mistreatment ranged from the near-slave conditions maintained by some crimps and traders in the mid-1800s in Hawaii and Cuba to the relatively dangerous tasks given to the Chinese during the construction of the Central Pacific Railroad in the 1860s.\n\nAmong his other reforms, Taiping Rebellion leader Hong Xiuquan abolished slavery and prostitution in the territory under his control in the 1850s and 1860s.\n\n\"Slavery exists in China, especially in Canton and Peking ... I have known a male slave. He is named Wang and is a native of Kansu, living in Kuei-chou in the house of his original master's son, and with his own family of four persons acknowledged to me that he was a slave, \"Nu-p'u\". He was a person of considerable ability, but did not appear to care about being free. Female slaves are very common all over China, and are generally called . . .\nYA-TOU 丫頭. Slave girl, a female slave. Slave girls are very common in China; nearly every Chinese family owns one or more slave girls generally bought from the girl's parents, but sometimes also obtained from other parties.\nIt is a common thing for well-to-do people to present a couple of slave girls to a daughter as part of her marriage dowery. Nearly all prostitutes are slaves. It is, however, customary with respectable people to release their slave girls when marriageable. Some people sell their slave girls to men wanting a wife for themselves or for a son of theirs.\nI have bought three different girls; two from Szű-chuan for a few taels each, less than fifteen dollars. One I released in Tientsin, another died in Hongkong; the other I gave in marriage to a faithful servant of mine. Some are worth much money at Shanghai.\"\n\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s the Yi people (also known as Nuosu) of China terrorized Sichuan to rob and enslave non-Nuosu including Han people. The descendants of the Han slaves, known as the White Yi (白彝), outnumbered the Black Yi (黑彝) aristocracy by ten to one. There was a saying goes like: \"the worst insult to a Nuosu is to call him a \"Han\" (with the implication being that \"your ancestors were slaves\")\".\n\n"}
