Although unsuccessful, the event led to the abdication of Alexander Battenberg.\n\nAfter the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) Bulgaria was liberated from Ottoman rule and Knyaz Alexander Battenberg was elected in 1879 as Prince of Bulgaria at the request of the Russian Tsar, his uncle, Alexander II. The latter was assassinated in 1881 and was succeeded by the conservative Alexander III.\n\nThe relations between Bulgaria and Russia suffered after the Bulgarian unification with Eastern Rumelia in 1885, which had not been approved by Russia. Prior to the subsequent Serbo-Bulgarian War, Russia had withdrawn its military officers, who had commanded all larger units of Bulgaria's young army until that point.\n\nDespite the successful Unification of Bulgaria, the Rusophile circles in the country held Knyaz Alexander Battenberg responsible for the deterioration of relations with Russia. The Rusophiles had valued Russia's role in supporting the restoration of Bulgaria as a state in the boundaries, promised by the preliminary Treaty of San Stefano.\n\nOn the eve of 8 to 9 August 1886 Alexander Battenberg was arrested in his palace in Sofia, forced to sign a decree for his abdication, and expelled from Bulgaria to Russia by boat. A provisional government was installed, led by Kliment of Tarnovo. However, the coup was not backed by many Bulgarian officers and politicians, including the chief of the National Assembly, Stefan Stambolov. A conter-coup, led by Sava Mutkurov, was organized in Plovdiv and the members of the original coup were quickly isolated. On 17 August 1886, Alexander Battenberg returned to Bulgaria, but his reign lasted only till 26 August 1886, when he abdicated of his own recognizance in an attempt to calm down the crisis in relations with Russia.\n\nThe relations between Bulgaria and Russia continued to be hostile in the years following the coup. Bulgaria elected a new Knyaz on 7 July 1887, Ferdinand I of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, an Austrian Emperor's nephew and an officer in the Austrian army. Bulgaria's domestic political life was dominated during the early years of Ferdinand's reign by liberal party leader Stefan Stambolov, whose foreign policy saw a marked cooling in relations with Russia, formerly seen as Bulgaria's protector.\n"}

{"id": "52389034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52389034", "title": "Basimba people", "text": "Basimba people\n\nThe people who currently identify themselves as Basimba or BaShimba for many and Musimba or MuShimba for singular are Bantu speaking, Community that exist in Uganda. Before the 13th Century they did maintain a shared identity as Basimba also defined in Swahili Language, as (a big lion), associated with either these people or the place which they came from.\n\nThe name Basimba or BaShimba (also known as the big Lion) was applied to the whole group by the early Ovambo people as a nickname for the leopard totem Clan people also known as bena Ngo in Zambia and in Uganda as abe Ngo.\nThe founder of Buganda, Kato Kintu in the 14th Century was the first Kabaka of the Kingdom of Buganda the father of Chwa I of Buganda in his immigration to Buganda (by then known as Muwaawa), went with thirteen clans known as (Abalasangeye) under the Kintu dynasty, and among these thirteen Clans was the Basimba Leopard (Ngo) Clan. King Kateregga of Buganda, between 1674-1680 C. at the current Butambala District, persecuted the Leopard (Ngo) Clan people killing four hundred of its members and causing others to conceal their Cultural identity. Given the pre-eminent role of the Leopard (Ngo) Clan in the Cult of Kintu, these people expected that in the event they were discovered to be briefly related to the Leopard (Ngo) Clan would have far reaching consequences and the same happened during Kabaka Jjunju of Buganda.\n\nThe Bashimba (Big Lion) of the Leopard totem Clan is a ruling Clan \namong the Royal Clans that moved from the Kingdom of Luba to Luapula Valley in Northern Rhodesia.\n\nThe leopard (Ngo) totem Clan is a Kingship group among the Basimba (Big Lion) people which was persecuted so much in Buganda because of its royal links. Among the many Leopard Clan branches, one of it was eligible for the throne. Reigning kings of Buganda would always capture this group and execute most of its men to reduce the risk of being overthrown.Clans give a sense of shared identity and descent to members.\n\nAfter the death of Kabaka Nakibinge of Buganda, his wife Nannono of the Leopard (Ngo) Clan between 1554 and 1556 AD, presided over as Kabaka for eighteen (18) month and the name Nabulya which literally means ‘I ate it’ insinuating I once took royal power was introduced in the Leopard (Ngo)Clan to remind other Clans in Buganda that a woman from the Leopard totem Clan once had power in Buganda Kingdom.\n\nAlthough little history has been known about the Basimba (Big Lion) people, more needs to be said because of their very close historical connection with the BaShimba who all belong to the Leopard (Ngo) Clan. Most Basimba people claim their origin lies in the Congo, among the Luba people of the Kingdom of Luba. Little is actually known about these immigrants, but traces of their history are found in the legend of the Tabwa ancestor.\n\nKyomba the ancestor of the Tabwa, a legendary man existed and lived on the Eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika. Faced with Hamitic pressures in the North and the people from the South to South, Kyomba and his companions crossed Lake Tanganyika by migrating to the Western shores of the Lake. Then Kyomba and his companions emigrated after the conspiracy mounted and hatched against him to the West and reached the shores of Lake Kivu. Then they crossed the Ruzizi and arrived Maniema and on the banks of river Lualaba to the second half of the 16th Century. Fanger son of Kyomba and his companions continued their migration up the river while others went elsewhere. The name Tumanya means “those that have followed the route by water’’ and Bena Kilunga means “those who followed the path on land in their migration”. The Bena Kilunga group migrated to the eastern banks of the Lualaba River and Lukunga River, together with Buanza, Mumba and the Basimba people.\nThe Tumanya group migrated to Ankori or the Nkole people and eastwards following the Luvua (Lualaba) while their companions Lualaba River to back the lagoons in Upemba Depression. It was around the 17th Century when the gradual arrival of people in the mountains from the plains of Lualaba Kamalondo and named these \"Kundelungu\" Mountains. Finally, Tanga and his father Kyomba further migrated across the Luapula at the current location of the position of Kasenga and settled in southern Tanganyika where they were joined by members of Zimba Clan.\n\n, avoiding quarrels will Movwe who migrated to the Marungu highlands.\n\nThe Basimba or BaShimba immigrants seem to have come in ethnic groups under the leadership of Mambwe, Mauwe, Katunku, Ngulya, Mwati, Kaabya, Ntembe, Namuyonjo, Kabolesa, Kitembwa and Kooli among others. When these people reached Luapula Valley the current Luapula Province in Zambia, Mwanza Region, Northern Tanzania and at Butambala in Uganda, they decided to settle and the leader became the family or the Clan head. As the Basimba or BaShimba settlement grew the original leader, after several generation, became to his descendants as mythical.\n\nBasimba or BaShimba people are recognized to be indigenous peoples, because they were the first comers among the immigrants in Zambia or Northern Rhodesia by then and in Tanzania, According to local tradition the original inhabitants were a Clan called the Basimba who lived in the area of Busere on Ukara Island, in the South-East corner of Lake Victoria, but it is not known what language they spoke and there are none of their descendants surviving. Tradition makes no mention of fighting between the Basimba immigrants and the people whom they found in Uhaya in Tanzania and at Butambala in Uganda. The Bashimba of the (Leopard clan) successfully resisted Nkuba in Northern Rhodesia (Zambia).\n\nThe original homeland of the Basimba or BaShimba people or their ancestry is shrouded in myths and legends. Whereas they seem to have lost contact with their original ancestors in Congo among the Luba people,leading to a cluster of Basimba (Big Lion) people migrate Northwards from Mweru – Luapula to Mwanza Region eventually erecting Human settlement's among the Haya people in Tanzania, then at Butambala District in the central region of Uganda, Buddu in Masaka District, Ntakaiwolu in Busoga, Mpogo in Sironko District, Butaleja District and at Lupada, Naboa, Budaka District, among the Gwere people, in the Eastern parts of Uganda. Other Bashimba people settled in Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) which was part of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Basimba practice the culture of performing rituals and ceremonies of the Chishimba spirit similar to the, Loa or kongo loa culture practiced by the Basimba people of Haiti who were sold in slavery in Haiti from Congo.\n\nThe Basimba (Big Lion) people in Uganda maintain the Basimba Spiritual stone, this stone represents the Chishimba spirit and is related to the institution of kingship. Its absence constitutes the absence of political power. According to Traditional African religions, the Chishimba spirit is synonymous to kingship and similar to the Kintu cult practiced by the leopard (Ngo) Clan people in Buganda. The Chishimba is kept in a specially prepared basket called ichipe ca calo—the basket of the nation or land. It is wrapped with bark cloth and kept in a specifically prepared shrine (ing'anda yaba Ba Chishimba or esawo lye ejjembe lya Basimba) dedicated to the spirit.\n\nBasimba people worked with Bunyoro-Kitara Kingdom's Priest in charge of the sacred pool of Muntebere. Each year the Bunyoro King sent a young slave-woman, two cows and a white sheep to the Priest. The slave-woman was given as a wife to one of the Abasimba Clan who was a servant of the Priest.\n\nThe abasimba dance of the Basimba people is a hunting dance performed by the Wajita or Jita people of Ukerewe Island.\n\nThe Basimba people Clan names of Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia are named after their lineal ancestors.\n\nNowadays, between 40% to 50% of the Basimba people are Christians and 50% are Muslim. Besides that, traditional beliefs are very widespread among them. The most important features are ancestor-worship (the term is called inappropriate by some authors) and totemism.\n\nThe Basimba of Kisangani who martyred Dr. Paul Carison of the Christ Church during the Congo Crisis of 1964 to 1965 participated in the Simba Rebellion that was later defeated.\n\nAccording to Basimba tradition, an afterlife does take place in another world, it is another form of existence in another world. The Basimba attitude towards dead ancestors is very similar to that towards living parents and grandparents.\nThere is a famous ritual to contact the dead ancestors that is practiced by the Basimba people. It is similar to Haitian Vodou art related to Loa a Haitian vodou religion practiced by the Basimba people of Haiti an Island that was proclaimed by Napoleon as an independent republic in 1804 and often lasts all night.\n\nBasimba totems (muziro) have been in use among the Basimba people since the initial development of their culture. Totems identify the different clans among the Basimba people that historically made up the dynasties of their ancient civilization. There are seven different totems that have been identified among the Basimba (Big Lion)people in Zimbabwe, Congo, Zambia and Uganda , such as the Basimba among the Haya Tribe in Tanzania.\nPeople of the same Clan use a common set of totems usually animals or birds.\n\nExamples of animal totems include Ngo/mbwili (Leopard), Leopard Cat, Genet Cat which in the Lega language is known as Musimba and also known as Kasimba in luganda language and known as Zimba in the Luba language and Nshimba in the Bemba language, Lion (Mpologoma), Mbwa (Dog), Kikere (Frog) and Nkoko (Rooster). People of the same totem are the descendants of one common ancestor (the founder of that totem) and thus are not allowed to marry or have an intimate relationship. The totems cross regional groupings and therefore provide a wall for development of ethnic group among the Basimba.\n\nBasimba chiefs are required to be able to recite the history of their totem group right from the initial founder before they can be sworn in as chiefs.\n\nThe totem system is a severe problem for many orphan, especially for Basimba or BaShimba women married to other Clans. The Basimba people are afraid of being punished by ghosts, if they violate rules connected with the unknown totem of a foundling. Therefore, it is very difficult to find adoptive parents for such children. And if the foundlings have grown up, they have problems getting married and on their death they are not buried on the Basimba ancestral grounds.\n\nThe identification by totem has very important ramifications at traditional ceremonies such as the Basimba burial ceremony. A person with a different totem cannot initiate burial of the deceased. A person of the same totem, even when coming from a different tribe, can initiate burial of the deceased. For example, a Muganda of the Ngo (Leopard) totem can initiate burial of a Musimba of the Leopard totem and that is perfectly acceptable in Basimba tradition. But a Musimba of a different totem cannot perform the ritual functions required to initiate burial of the deceased.\n\nIf a person initiates the burial of a person of a different totem, he runs the risk of being asked to pay a fine to the family of the deceased. Such fines traditionally were paid with cattle or goats but nowadays substantial amounts of money can be asked for. If they bury their dead family members, they would come back at some point to cleanse the stone of the burial.\n\nThe Basimba people consider themselves subjects of the Chishimba, the Basimba's single paramount Chief. These Basimba people lived in villages of 50 to 100 people and are now numbering to 100,000 in number by 2016. \nThere are seven Basimba (Big Lion) people Clan groups named after animals and these are:-\nSome of the Basimba people migrated northwards from Luapula valley after the disintegration of the Shila states and others remained in Northern Rhodesia currently known as BaShimba or abeena Ngo (Leopard) totem Clan. The BaShimba Leopard totem Clan is a ruling clan among the Lungu and Bemba.\n\nBasimba or BaShimba people exist in Zambia formerly known as Northern Rhodesia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Haiti,DR Congo and Tanzania. For example, the omugurusi of the Basimba clan is Mauwe who on the day of his birth a dog had puppies. This dog often washed Mauwe as a child by licking him. Mauwe later out of gratitude, ordered his descendants to consider the dog as their friend, the word \"Basimba\" or \"BaShimba\" actually has several meanings. It may designate people of Basimba people origin regardless of where they live e.g. whether they live in urban areas or in the original rural Basimba areas of Mpogo, Sironko , Lupada, Naboa in Budaka District or Butambala District, Mooni,Mbale District in Uganda, Luapula Valley in Zambia or Northern Rhodesia and Kagera Region among the Haya tribe in Bugorora Ward or County of Missenyi District in Tanzania. The original language of the Basimba people is unknown.\n\nThe BaShimba people living in Zambia's Northern province, among the Lungu and Bemba tribes speak the language which is most closely related to the Bantu languages the Lungu and ChiBemba (in Zambia and the DRC), Haya (in Tanzania) and Luganda of the Baganda and Lugwere of the Gwere people (in Uganda). In Uganda, Luganda is mainly spoken in the central and eastern parts of Uganda, and has become the most widely spoken language in the Country, although not always as a first language.\n\nThe History or Genealogy of the Basimba (Big Lion) people has given rise to numerous debates among historians to whether the Basimba people of the Leopard (Ngo) Clan in Uganda come with Kabaka, Kato Kintu in the 14th Century or migrated either direct from Congo or Luapula valley to Uganda.\n\nSome historians, anthropologists and sociologists like David William Cohen, Ian George Cunnison,Hans Cory, Mwelwa Chambika Musambachine, Gideon Were,Stephen Kyeyune, Tausir Niane, Mary Douglas, M. Hartnoll, Dr. Schinz and Fisher A. B among others have written books about Basimba people but have not stated the names of the Basimba ancestors who left the Luba people in Congo and migrated to places like Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Uganda. Some historians who have written History of Africa books, use imprecise narrative documents to make estimates which must be treated with caution.\nSocieties like Anthropological Society of London and Ethnological Society of London have also not yet published a full physical or cultural aspects of the Basimba people or due to the pronunciation of the name Basimba as Vazimba who migrated from East Africa and settled in Madagascar. The Vazimba are kinsmen of the Ba-Simba.\n\n"}

This followed the adoption of the UK trading with the enemy restrictions enacted in 1914, which had been incorporated into Canadian law in 1914 by order in council. From 1916 to 1919, the Minister of Finance and the Secretary of State had joint responsibility for acting as Custodian.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1939, it served the function of administering war claims and reparations. Under legislation authorizing the conclusion of treaties of peace the \"Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920\" was issued to create the Office, under the authority of the Secretary of State as sold custodian. The Office acted as one of the \"clearing offices\" authorized under Article 296 of the Treaty of Versailles for the collection and payment of enemy debts, and Article 297 authorized Canada to keep and liquidate any German property in Canada. Investigations and recommendations respecting claims for reparations were undertaken by the separately appointed Royal Commission on Reparations, chaired by Errol McDougall.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, the \"Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1939\" expanded the scope of the Office. From 1942 the role of the Custodian was expanded to include the administration of property seized from Japanese Canadians.\n\nIn the postwar period, the Custodian had the responsibility for resolving Canadian War Claims, and the resolution of outstanding wartime property issues. This latter process was complicated by the implications of the large scale nationalization of property in Eastern Europe by the Communist regimes established in the post war period under Soviet auspices. The WWII regulations were continued on a temporary basis following the end of hostilities, and were continued in 1947 by the \"Trading with the Enemy (Transitional Powers) Act\". The Act ceased to have effect at the end of September 1992, and was consequently repealed in 1996.\n\nThe Office ceased operations in 1985. Its files were transferred to Library and Archives Canada, but there is evidence that some have been destroyed without assessing their historical value. The Office never produced annual reports outlining its activities.\n\n\n\n"}

She started her academic career pursuing an Sc.B. in mechanical engineering at Brown University, which she received in 1994. Before she attended graduate school, she lived in Los Angeles where she volunteered for the Sierra Club. She then went on to earn her Ph.D. in Geophysics from the University of Washington (UW) in 2003, where her dissertation focused on the dynamic behavior of ice divides. Pettit also worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at UW until 2006 and then became a research physical scientist at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Lab in New Hampshire. In 2008, she moved to The University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF), and promoted to Associate Professor.\n\nPettit's research is primarily focused on glacial dynamics and exploring the interactions within the ice-ocean-earth system. Pettit is a National Geographic Emerging Explorer who innovated applying acoustic research with hydrophones to calving and melting glaciers reaching the ocean, to examine ice shelf disintegration and the ice-ocean boundary. Her work has been recognized by numerous high-profile sources, including \"EARTH magazine,\" and \"National Geographic,\" and she was invited to present a TEDWomen talk, on her investigations focused on \"listening\" to glaciers. Her research on glacier sounds extends to how the underwater noise affects marine animals. She also created and runs the Girls on Ice program, a wilderness science program that teaches high school girls about glaciology, ecology, and mountaineering. Girls on Ice started in Washington in 1999, with Pettit taking five girls to the South Cascade Glacier. During the program, adolescent girls learn mountaineering skills, how to use GPS for glacier measurement and how to calculate the velocity of streams.\n\nPettit has received numerous awards including the National Science Foundation (NSF) Geoscience El Niño RAPID Award (2016), the Inspiring Women in STEM award, Insight into Diversity (2015), the WINGS WorldQuest Earth Award (2007), the David A.

The Group was created in Solothurn on 12 September 1982 by 120 people. Its roster has varied considerably; as of 2009 its website states that it consists of about 20,000 members or supporters, consisting largely of pacifists and anti-militarists.\n\nThe group is politically active and spreads awareness of its cause in several ways:\n\nCurrently, the group focuses on the following topics:\n\nIn early 1986 the group launched its first initiative, named \"Für eine Schweiz ohne Armee und für eine umfassende Friedenspolitik\" (\"For a Switzerland without an army and an overall peaceful political stance\"), which gathered 111,300 signatures (100,000 were required to initiate a vote). On 26 November 1989, 68.6% of eligible voters cast their ballot, resulting in 1,052,218 (35.6%) votes for the initiative. The high percentage of yes voters stunned everybody, and was interpreted as a manifestation of a remarkable loss of significance of the military in Swiss society. Although the initiative was rejected, the surprising result of the initiative influenced later reforms of Switzerland's armed forces.\n\nIn Spring 1992, both chambers of the Swiss parliament decided to procure 34 F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets. Within 32 days, the GSoA gathered 503,719 signatures. Never before and never since has an initiative been submitted within such a short time or with a comparable number of signatures. Nevertheless, the Swiss people rejected the initiative on the ballot by 57% to 43%.\n\nIn 1999, the GSoA assisted in collecting the 50,000 valid signatures necessary for a referendum on whether Switzerland would join the United Nations. The Swiss electorate approved this proposal in 2002. In 2001, the GSoA gathered more than 60,000 signatures for a referendum against the revised legislation regulating the structure and deployment of the armed forces. The GSoA especially opposed the option to send armed troops abroad — a concern that was shared by some right-wing traditionalists. On 10 June 2001, the revised legislation was approved by 51% of the voters.\n\nOn 2 December 2001, Swiss voters considered two additional GSoA initiatives, called \"In favor of a credible security policy and a Switzerland without an army\" and \"Solidarity instead of soldiers: In favor of a voluntary civilian peace service\". In contrast to the first initiative to abolish the Swiss army, there was only sparse public debate on the issue - another topic dominated the media and the minds of the people: The September 11 attacks which occurred a few weeks before the vote took place. Both initiatives were rejected by 78% and 77% of the voters.\n\nOn 21 September 2007, the GSoA submitted an initiative that required a ban on all arms exports from Switzerland. This initiative was rejected on November 29, 2009 with 68.2% of the voters casting a no.\n\nAnother initiative required stricter legislation on private possession of firearms and a stop to the Swiss tradition to store the assault rifles of each soldier at home. The initiative was supported by some 40 organisations, of which the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland, the Green Party of Switzerland and the GSoA made the largest contributions. The initiative was rejected on February 13, 2011 with 56.3% of the voters saying no.\n\nGSoA's initiative to abolish conscription was rejected by 73.2% of the Swiss electorate on September 22, 2013.\n\nIn 2008 the Swiss Federal Council announced its plans to purchase a new generation of fighter aircraft. Immediately after this, the GSoA started an initiative that proposes a 10-year-moratorium for aircraft procurements. The collection of signatures was completed in May 2009. After garanting the group that there would be a Referendum about new fighter jets the group pulled the initiative back. When the parliament decided to buy new jets 2014 it was possible to collect signatures for a referendum which is easier to win than an initiative. In the end 53% of Swiss voters decided not to buy new Gripen fighter jets on May 18, 2014. This was the first victory on the ballot for GSoA in a nationwide referendum.\n"}

The inspiration for the \"Epic Jazz Jive\" came from observing ducks, waddling through sand, on the beach.\n\nAfter the contest, \"Run Away\" would also become the subject of a major internet meme surrounding the saxophone solos performed by saxophonist Sergey Stepanov who, in a phenomenon similar to Rickrolling and Trololo, was dubbed the \"Epic Sax Guy\" in videos on YouTube. Later, this song is used more as background music of video gaming(such as \"Hearthstone\" and \"Rainbow Six Siege\")\"Best moments\" videos. The rules of the contest prohibited musical instruments being played on stage, meaning Stepanov was not actually playing the saxophone at all, but rather synchronising movements with a prerecorded track.\n\n"}
