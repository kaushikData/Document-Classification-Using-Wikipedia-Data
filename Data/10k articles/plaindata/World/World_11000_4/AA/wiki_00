{"id": "2713426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2713426", "title": "Arm's length principle", "text": "Arm's length principle\n\nThe arm's length principle (ALP) is the condition or the fact that the parties to a transaction are independent and on an equal footing. Such a transaction is known as an \"arm's-length transaction\".\n\nIt is used specifically in contract law to arrange an agreement that will stand up to legal scrutiny, even though the parties may have shared interests (e.g., employer–employee) or are too closely related to be seen as completely independent (e.g., the parties have familial ties).\n\nAn arm's length relationship is distinguished from a fiduciary relationship, where the parties are not on an equal footing, but rather, power and information asymmetries exist.\n\nIt is also one of the key elements in international taxation as it allows an adequate allocation of profit taxation rights among countries that conclude double tax conventions, through transfer pricing, among each other. Transfer pricing and the arm's length principle was one of the focal points of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project developed by the OECD and endorsed by the G20.\n\nA simple example of not at arm's length is the sale of real property from parents to children. The parents might wish to sell the property to their children at a price below market value, but such a transaction might later be classified by a court as a gift rather than a bona fide sale, which could have tax and other legal consequences. To avoid such a classification, the parties need to show that the transaction was conducted no differently from how it would have been for an arbitrary third party. This could be done, for example, by hiring a disinterested third party, such as an appraiser or broker, who could offer a professional opinion that the sale price is appropriate and reflects the true value of the property.\n\nThe principle is often invoked to avoid any undue government influence over other bodies, such as the legal system, the press, or the arts. For example, in the United Kingdom Arts Councils operate \"at arm's length\" in allocating the funds they receive from the government.\n\nIn the workplace, supervisors and managers deal with employee discipline and termination of employment at arm's length through the human resources department, if the company has one. In such cases, terminations and discipline must be rendered by staff who have the training and certification to do so legally. This is intended to protect the employer from legal recourse that employees may otherwise have in the event that it can be demonstrated that such discipline or terminations were not handled in accordance with the latest labor laws. For employees in unionised environments, shop stewards can represent the employee, whereas the HR department represents the company, so that both sides are on a more equal footing and can resolve matters outside of court, using informal negotiations or a grievance, saving both sides time and money. The arm's length dealings in this case mean that both an employee and a supervisor each have a qualified advocate.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has adopted the principle in Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, to ensure that transfer prices between companies of multinational enterprises are established on a market value basis. In this context, the principle means that prices should be the same as they would have been, had the parties to the transaction not been related to each other. This is often seen as being aimed at preventing profits being systematically deviated to lowest tax countries, although most countries are also concerned about prices that fail to meet the arm's length test due to inattention rather than by design and that shifts profits to any other country (whether it has low or high tax rates).\n\nThe OECD Model Tax Convention provides the legal framework for governments to have their fair share of taxes, and for enterprises to avoid double taxation on their profits. The arm's length standard is instrumental to determine \"how much\" of the profits should be attributed to one entity and, consequently, the extent of a country's tax claim on such entity. The OECD has developed thorough guidelines on how the arm's length principle should be applied in this context. Under this approach, a price is considered appropriate if it is within a range of prices that would be charged by independent parties dealing at arm's length. This is generally defined as a price that an independent buyer would pay an independent seller for an identical item under identical terms and conditions, where neither is under any compulsion to act.\n\nTransfer pricing became a highly controversial topic in the last years, which contributed to the development of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project by the OECD and with the endorsement of the G20.\n\nThe World Customs Organisation (WCO) and World Trade Organisation (WTO) have also adopted, in effect, the arm's length principle in Customs valuations. The Agreement on Implementation of Article VII (known as the WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation or the “Valuation Agreement”) ensures that determinations of the customs value for the application of duty rates to imported goods are conducted in a neutral and uniform manner, precluding the use of arbitrary or fictitious customs values.\n\n\n"}

Since both organizations operated underground, and were wanted by the French government, the line between a military and a civilian target was hard to draw, and often wilfully disregarded by the combatants. Groups from both the MNA and the FLN resorted to gangland-style killings, intimidation and the murder of civilians to pursue their political goals and secure finances and influence. This led to the Café Wars being portrayed in France as acts of random terrorism, and conflated with attacks on French settlers in Algeria.\n\nAccording to some estimates the Café Wars cost an estimated 5,000 lives. The official French figures are 3,975 dead and a total of 10,223 victims (dead or wounded) \n\nThe Café Wars did not end before Algeria was granted independence in 1962, by the government of Charles de Gaulle.

The vessel was named after the dark region in Hades of Greek mythology, called Erebus. The 372-ton ship was armed with two mortars – one and one – and 10 guns. The ship took part in the Ross expedition of 1839 to 1843 and was abandoned during the third Franklin Expedition. The sunken wreck was discovered in September 2014 after a long search.\n\nAfter two years' service in the Mediterranean Sea, \"Erebus\" was refitted as an exploration vessel for Antarctic service, and on 21 November 1840 – captained by James Clark Ross – she departed from Van Diemen's Land for Antarctica in company with . In January 1841, the crews of both ships landed on Victoria Land, and proceeded to name areas of the landscape after British politicians, scientists, and acquaintances. Mount Erebus, on Ross Island, was named after one ship and Mount Terror after the other.\n\nThe crew then discovered the Ross Ice Shelf, which they were unable to penetrate, and followed it eastward until the lateness of the season compelled them to return to Van Diemen's Land. The following season, 1842, Ross continued to survey the \"Great Ice Barrier\", as it was called, continuing to follow it eastward. Both ships returned to the Falkland Islands before returning to the Antarctic in the 1842–1843 season. They conducted studies in magnetism, and returned with oceanographic data and collections of botanical and ornithological specimens. The plants were described in the resulting \"The Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of H.M. Discovery Ships Erebus and Terror in the years 1839–1843, under the Command of Captain Sir James Clark Ross\".\n\nBirds collected on the first expedition were described and illustrated by George Robert Gray and Richard Bowdler Sharpe in \"The Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Erebus & HMS Terror. Birds of New Zealand\", 1875. The revised edition of Gray (1846) (1875). The future botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, then aged 23, was assistant-surgeon to Robert McCormick.\n\nFor their next voyage to the Arctic under Sir John Franklin, both \"Erebus\" and were outfitted with steam engines from the London and Greenwich Railway steam locomotives. That of \"Erebus\" was rated at and could propel the ship at . The ships carried 12 days' supply of coal. The ships had iron plating added to their hulls. Sir John Franklin sailed in \"Erebus\", in overall command of the expedition, and \"Terror\" was again commanded by Francis Crozier. The expedition was ordered to gather magnetic data in the Canadian Arctic and to complete a crossing of the Northwest Passage, which had already been partly charted from both the east and west but had never been entirely navigated.\n\nThe ships were last seen entering Baffin Bay in August 1845. The disappearance of the Franklin expedition set off a massive search effort in the Arctic. The broad circumstances of the expedition's fate were first revealed when Hudson's Bay Company doctor John Rae collected artifacts and testimony from local Inuit in 1853. Later expeditions up to 1866 confirmed these reports.\n\nBoth ships had become icebound and had been abandoned by their crews, totaling about 130 men, all of whom died from a variety of causes, including hypothermia, scurvy, and starvation while trying to trek overland to the south. Subsequent expeditions until the late 1980s, including autopsies of crew members, also revealed that \"Erebus\" and \"Terror\"s shoddily canned rations may have been tainted by both lead and botulism. Oral reports by local Inuit that some of the crew members resorted to cannibalism were at least somewhat supported by forensic evidence of cut marks on the skeletal remains of crew members found on King William Island during the late 20th century.\n\nA British transport ship, \"Renovation\", spotted two ships on a large ice floe off the coast of Newfoundland in April 1851. The identities of the ships were not confirmed. It was suggested over the years that these might have been \"Erebus\" and \"Terror\", though it is now certain they could not have been and were most likely abandoned whaling ships.\n\nOn 15 August 2008, Parks Canada, an agency of the Government of Canada, announced a Can$ 75,000 six-week search deploying the icebreaker , with the goals of finding the ships and reinforcing Canada's claims regarding sovereignty over large portions of the Arctic. The search was headed by underwater archeologist Robert Grenier, of Parks Canada, and local historian Louie Kamookak, who had collected Inuit oral histories related to the wreck, as well working with the written records.\n\nThe wreckage of one of Franklin's ships was found on 2 September 2014 by a Parks Canada team led by Ryan Harris and Marc-André Bernier. On 1 October 2014, it was announced that the remains were those of \"Erebus\". Recovery of the ship's bell was announced on 6 November 2014. On 4 March 2015, a winter diving expedition on \"Erebus\", consisting of Parks Canada and Royal Canadian Navy divers, was announced to commence in April.\n\nOn 12 September 2016, it was announced that the wreck of HMS \"Terror\" had been found submerged in Terror Bay, off the south-west coast of King William Island. The wrecks are designated a National Historic Site of Canada with the precise location of the designation in abeyance.\n\nOn 23 October 2017, it was announced by the UK's defence minister, Sir Michael Fallon, that his government would be giving HMS \"Erebus\" and its sister ship HMS \"Terror\" to Canada, retaining only a few relics and any gold, along with the right to repatriate any human remains.\n\nHMS \"Erebus\" is featured, often alongside HMS \"Terror\", in fictional works that use the Franklin expedition in their backstories, such as:\n\n\n\n"}

From 1860 it was legally punishable through several regime changes until it was finally decriminalised once again in 1994. \n\nThe first pride walk took place in 2001. As the walked progressed in Belgrade, it was stopped when protesters and police clashed with one another. In the years, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013, the LGBT community of Serbia scheduled a gay pride walk that received the treatment of getting banned each year by the authorities in the country. \n\nIn 2010, the pride march was attempted again. Similar results to the first march, this march was visited by thousands of individuals such as football fans and members of \"right-wing\" organizations. These individuals caused destruction, such as throwing missiles, stones, and setting cars on fire. The mayhem destroyed the walk, and also injured police officers. This march was overshadowed by 6,500 protesters. The pride walk was banned in 2011 which led the members of the gay community to believe that this act was a sign that supported violence towards gay people. Those in the Serbian LGBT community feared for their lives, due to severe cruelty by people with homophobic mindsets. Risks of violence continued to be high in Serbia against the LGBT community. Fourteen percent of respondents who took a survey, felt as if acts of violence was a proper way to respond to homosexuality.\n\nBoris Melicevic was an openly gay leader for Serbia who became a part of a political party in December 2010. In 2010, Serbia passed the \"anti-discrimination law\", which protected LGBT Serbians from being treated unequal. More than half of Serbians say that they are against violence and discrimination against homosexuals, however roughly two-thirds of the country believed that identifying as a homosexual was a disease. In 2008, the Serbian Medical Society determined that being LGBT was not a disease, being a member of the \" World Health Organization\", deferring from its opinions.\n\nIn Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina homosexuality was decriminalised in 1977, but when Vojvodina was re=introduced fully into the Republic of Serbia legal system during the breakout of Yugoslavia, it was recriminalised again, until 1994.\n\nIn 1937 Belgrade based daily newspaper Politika published news about young man from Central Serbia who arrived in Belgrade with his brothers to change his sex.\n\nThere are sources about homosexual Yugoslav Partisans during World War II in Yugoslavia. Milovan Đilas in his war memoirs tells the story from Sandžak where one Muslim soldier was exposed as homosexual by other soldiers and Regional Secretary. Regional Secretary in doubt ask Đilas if he should \"execute this freak\", while Đilas remains in doubt admitting that at the time he did not know Communist Party of Yugoslavia practice nor anything was said about such matters by Marx and Lenin. At the end under common sense he concluded that \"from such vices suffer proletarians, and not only bourgeois decadent\" but that he can not have functions or be party member. Đilas says that he only later learned \"that that homosexual, who in appearance was sheer manhood, was very brave and courageously fell in battle\".\n\nIn 1990 in Hotel Moskva in Belgrade, which was popular gay gathering place in 70-ties, one gay and lesbian group began to organize meetings and in January 1991 they founded organization Arkadija.\n\n\n"}

The Catholic population for which it catered was largely German in ethnic origin, although there were also significant Polish and Armenian Catholic communities. The see city of the diocese was Saratov rather than Tiraspol; the choice of Tiraspol for the name of the diocese may have been because the city had been the cathedral city of the fourteenth century diocese of Kherson. The first Roman Catholic bishop of Tiraspol, appointed in 1850, was Ferdinand Helanus Kahn, OP, a German Dominican. Wincenty Lipski, a Pole, was appointed auxiliary bishop in 1856.\n\nAfter Bishop Kahn's death in 1864, successive bishops were Franz Xaver Zottmann, 1872–1888; Anton Zerr, 1889–1902; Eduard von der Ropp, 1902–1903; Joseph Kessler, from 1904. Under Soviet rule, the diocese, as with the structures of many other churches and religious communities, was the subject of repression. Bishop Kessler went into exile in 1918, and the see of Tiraspol became formally vacant on his death in 1933. Meanwhile, there were attempts to organise the diocese under a series of apostolic administrators, viz.: Johannes Roth, Alexander Frison, and Augustin Baumtrog, but these attempts ended in increased repression, and in two cases, their execution (Frison in 1937, Roth in 1938).\n\nThe diocese remained inactive, but formally in existence, until its formal suppression in 2002, when the new diocese of St Clement in Saratov was erected, incorporating territory within Russia belonging to the former diocese of Tiraspol. Territory of the former diocese now situated in Moldova and Transnistria was assigned to the Apostolic Administration of Moldova, erected in 1993. Territory of the former diocese in southern Ukraine is now part of the Diocese of Odessa-Simferopol.\n\n"}
