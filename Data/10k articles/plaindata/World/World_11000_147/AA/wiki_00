{"id": "46260828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46260828", "title": "Global silver trade from the 16th to 18th centuries", "text": "Global silver trade from the 16th to 18th centuries\n\nThe global silver trade between the Americas and Europe from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries was a spillover of the Columbian Exchange which had a profound effect on the world economy. In fact, many scholars consider the silver trade to mark the beginning of a genuinely global economy, with one historian noting that silver \"went round the world and made the world go round.\" Although global, much of that silver ended up in the hands of the Chinese, as they accepted it as a form of currency. In addition to the global economic changes the silver trade engendered, it also put into motion a wide array of political transformations in the early modern era. \"New World mines,\" concluded several prominent historians \"supported the Spanish empire,\" acting as a linchpin of the Spanish economy.\n\nSpaniards at the time of the Age of Exploration discovered vast amounts of silver, much of which was from the Potosí silver mines, to fuel their trade economy. Potosí's deposits were rich and Spanish American silver mines were the world's cheapest sources of it. The Spanish acquired the silver, minting it into the peso de ocho (a currency) to then use it as a means of purchase; that currency was so widespread that even the United States accepted it as valid until the Coinage Act of 1857. As the Spanish need for silver increased, new innovations for more efficient extraction of silver were developed, such as the amalgamation method of using mercury to extract silver from ore.\n\nIn the two centuries that followed the discovery of Potosí, the Spanish silver mines in the Americas produced 40,000 tons of silver. Altogether, more than 150,000 tons of silver were shipped from Potosí by the end of the 18th century. From 1500 to 1800, Mexico and Peru produced about 80% of the world's silver with 30% of it eventually ending up in China (largely because of British merchants who used it to purchase exotic Chinese commodities). In the late 16th and early 17th century, Japan was also exporting heavily into China and the foreign trade at large.\n\nAs has been demonstrated, China dominated silver imports. The market value of silver in the Ming territory was double its value elsewhere, which provided great arbitrage profit for the Europeans and Japanese. The abundance of silver in China made it easy for the country to mint it into coinage. That process was so widespread that local Chinese government officials would demand taxes to be paid in silver to the point that silver eventually backed all of China's economy.\n\nThe world's first paper money (\"flying money\") was invented by the Chinese and they needed some commodity to back it. Traditional coins were useful, but the amount of coins needed for large purchases could be bulky and dangerous to transport. That problem was solved when the Chinese created small pieces of paper with pictures of the coin printed on them. By the nature of their geography, China had no real amount of precious metals of their own to back the paper money they invented. Because the Spaniards didn't find gold but did find copious amounts of silver, the Spaniards and the rest of Europe used this silver to purchase the commodities of choice from China, solving both of their problems.\n\nA result of the Spanish colonization of the Americas was the discovery, production, and trade of precious metals. The Spanish, along with other European nations, had a great desire for Chinese goods such as silk and porcelain. The Europeans did not have any goods or commodities which China desired, so they traded silver to make up for their trade deficit. The two most important mining colonies of the Spanish Empire were Peru and Mexico, who were estimated to have provided one-hundred thousand tons of silver from the mid 16th Century to the end of the colonial period. The richest, and most productive mine in the Americas was that of Potosí in what is modern day Bolivia. The richest camp in Mexico was in the city of Zacatecas, however the production of this mine was far less than that of Potosi.\n\nMore simplistic native mining techniques dominated American mining for the early part of the 16th Century. Mining in the Americas became formally industrialized when the process of mercury amalgamation became popularized. Mercury amalgamation was invented by a Spaniard in central Mexico in the 1550s. Historians dispute what individual was the first to invent the process, however most agree that it was a Spaniard. Mercury was the one of the highest costs of production for the Americas, since much of it had to be shipped. The ratio of Mercury to silver produced was about two to one. Furthermore, German miners introduced the stamp mill and lead smelting in the 1530s. Gunpowder was often used to blast of large holes to create the mine shafts, although there were not many deep shafts. Potosí had the most amount of ore, however it was lower quality than that of Mexico.\n\nMining production in the Americas largely depended on native labor in both Mexico and Peru. In Mexico, many of the natives worked as wage laborers by the middle of the 17th Century. However, the labor system known as the repartimiento still existed in some places. Silver production in Mexico was relatively cheap when compared to that of Peru, and the general trend of Mexican labor systems was that towards waged labor. In Peru mines, the mit'a system was a dominant form of native labor subjection, although waged laborers worked on the mines as well. Natives under the mit'a system were paid much less, and this was necessary for the production of silver to continue in Peru where costs were relatively high.\n\nThe ultimate destination for the mass amounts of silver produced in the Americas and Japan was China. Silver from the Americas flowed mostly across the Atlantic and made its way to the far east. A popular route was around the Cape of Good Hope into the east, and sometimes it came over land. Major outposts for the silver trade were located in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines. The city of Manilla served as a primary outpost of the exchange of goods between the Americas, Japan, and China. However, there is a large amount of silver that crossed across the Pacific Ocean directly from the Americas as well. There are not many records of the amount of silver which crossed the Pacific due to it being discouraged by the Spanish monarchy, so estimates highly vary.\n\nSilver also found its way across other parts of the world as well. India and Europe both received a fair amount of silver. This silver was often locally traded for other commodities, such as gold or crops. In India, silver flowed from the south to the north, and gold flowed the opposite way. Often silver and gold were manufactured into jewelry or hoarded as treasure.\n\nChina was the ultimate destination in which silver would flow towards. In exchange, the Chinese traded their popular goods such as silk and porcelain. China had a high demand for silver due to its shift from paper money to coins in the early period of the Ming Dynasty. The Ming paper currency eventually failed due to self-imposed inflation along with an inability to stop the production of counterfeit bills. The Ming attempted to produce copper coins as a new form of currency, but production was inconsistent. Hence silver became of high value because it was a valid currency that could be processed abroad. The bimetallic ratio of silver to gold was about two to one, which meant that European and Japanese merchants made a large amount of profit. In the 1640s, the bimetallic ratios in China converged with the rest of the world, before experiencing another population boom. The new population boom was a product of the introduction of New World crops into China, mainly sweet potatoes, which could be more easily grown. By this time, the silver mines in Japan were largely depleted and the New World became China's primary source for silver.\n\nInitially, Japan served as China's primary source for silver in the 16th Century. In exchange for silver, China would provide Japan with silk and gold. Japan and China did not directly trade with each other, due to political tensions. This meant that European entities and countries, such as the Dutch and Portuguese served as a middle man between the two countries.\n\nIn the famed \"The Wealth of Nations,\" Adam Smith noted the sheer force and great reach of the global silver trade. He was impressed by its market value but more intrigued with the way this single item of commerce brought together new and old worlds i.e. the Americas and China. Although China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade, Japan's huge contribution of silver exports to China were critical to the world economy and China's liquidity and success with the commodity. Historians posit Europeans would have been left out of world trade, and China may have fallen prey to conquest by settlers of the Americas if not for Japanese silver mining. Silver was paramount to East Asia's introduction into the global trade market. Under the Ming and Qing empires, China hoarded silver to boost its economy and increase its trading power.\n\nMany historians argue that silver was responsible for the birth of global economics and trade. According to this view, global trade commenced in 1571 when Manila was founded and became the first trading post linking America and Asia due to the expansive and profitable silver trade. In fact, research shows the amount of silver traveling from Manila to China was approximately three million pesos or 94,000 kilograms in the early 1600s.\n\nThe rarity of silver production was seen as an opportunity for China to control the currency's value and support its own national currency. Silver was one of the only accepted trade items from Europeans and its value in China was astronomical compared to rest of the world. In fact, its value was twice that of Spain in the 16th and 17th centuries. Between 1600 and 1800 China received 100 tons of silver on average per year. A large populace near the Lower Yangzte averaged a hundreds of taels of silver per household in the late 16th century.\n\nSilver even played a large role when defending Toyotomi Hideyoshi's attemptive take over of Ming ruled Joseon Korea. The Ming Ministiry of War sent approximately 140,000 liang of silver to its soldiers and required provinces to provide silver as tax for the war effort as well. In the sixteenth century, the daimyos of Southwest Japan hoped for unhinged global trade but were stopped due to Ming China trade policies. Still, Japan became a player in the global economy via frequent Ming merchant ships arriving to extract Japan's abundance of silver and exchange goods. Japan increased its wealth through successful trilateral trade with Portugal and China as Japan now had Chinese goods to offer the Portuguese who had silver mines of their own. Founder of the Ming China dynasty, Hongwu, actually sought to eliminate silver from the market due to his fear of inflation which he previously experienced in the Yuan dynasty. His attempt involved imposing harsh limits on silver mining to stop its flow into the market and subsequently replaced it with baochao or paper money. However, the currency never popularized and silver proved its mainstay as a global currency.\n\nDespite some restrictions, silver continued to drive trade through its popularity in Europe. This, combined with a high British demand for Chinese tea, created chronic trade deficits for European governments, which were forced to risk silver deficits to supply merchants in Asia. As supplies of silver decreased in Europe, Europeans had less ability to purchase highly coveted Chinese goods. Merchants were no longer able to sustain the China trade through profits made by selling Chinese goods in the West and were forced to take bullion out of circulation in Europe to buy goods in China.\n\nIn the 19th century, American merchants began to introduce opium to Chinese markets. The demand for opium rose rapidly and was so profitable that Chinese opium dealers began to seek out more suppliers of the drug, thus inaugurating the opium trade; one merchant declared that Opium \"is like gold. It can sell any time.\" From 1804 to 1820, a period when the Qing Dynasty needed to finance the suppression of the White Lotus Rebellion, Chinese merchants were soon exporting silver to pay for opium rather than Europeans paying for Chinese goods with the precious metal.\n\nThe Qing imperial court debated whether and how to end the opium trade, eventually settling on regulations on consumption. That measure, however, resulted in an increase in drug smuggling by Europeans and Chinese traders. In 1810, the Daoguang Emperor issued an edict concerning the matter, declaring, \"Opium has a harm. Opium is a poison, undermining our good customs and morality. Its use is prohibited by law.\" Following a debate at court in 1836 on whether to legalize the drug or crack down on its use, the emperor decided on the latter. An upright official, Commissioner Lin Zexu led the campaign against opium as a kind of \"drug czar.\" The British, offended by the seizure of their property in opium, sent a large naval expedition to China to end the restrictive conditions under which they had long traded with that country. Thus began the first Opium War, in which Britain's industrialized military might was proven in China's rout. The Treaty of Nanking, which ended the war in 1842 largely on British terms, imposed numerous restrictions on Chinese sovereignty and opened five ports to European traders.\n\n"}

{"id": "5047323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5047323", "title": "Locksley Hall", "text": "Locksley Hall\n\n\"Locksley Hall\" is a poem written by Alfred Tennyson in 1835 and published in his 1842 collection of \"Poems\". It narrates the emotions of a rejected suitor come to his childhood home, the apparently fictional Locksley Hall, though in actuality Tennyson was a guest of the Arundel family in their stately home named Locksley Hall where he spent much of his time writing whilst on his visits.\n\nAccording to Tennyson, the poem represents \"young life, its good side, its deficiencies, and its yearnings\". Tennyson's son Hallam recalled that his father said the poem was inspired by Sir William Jones's prose translation of the Arabic Mu'allaqat.\n\n\"Locksley Hall\" is a dramatic monologue written as a set of 97 rhyming couplets. Each line follows a modified version of trochaic octameter in which the last unstressed syllable has been eliminated; moreover, there is generally a caesura, whether explicit or implicit, after the first four trochees in the line. Each couplet is separated as its own stanza. The University of Toronto library identifies this form as \"the old 'fifteener' line,\" quoting Tennyson, who claimed it was written in trochaics because the father of his friend Arthur Hallam suggested that the English liked the meter. The meter is reminiscent of that of the \"Nibelungenlied\".\n\nThe poem opens with the unnamed protagonist asking his friends to continue ahead and leave him alone to muse about the past and the future. He reveals that the place he has stopped at is called Locksley Hall, and he spent his childhood there. The rest of the poem, though written as rhymed metered verse, follows the stream of consciousness of its protagonist as an interior monologue. The protagonist struggles to reach some sort of catharsis on his childhood feelings.\n\nIn his monologue, the protagonist begins with fond memories of his childhood sweetheart, but those memories quickly lead to a burst of anger as he relates that the object of his affections abandoned him due to her parents' disapproval. He proceeds to offer a biting criticism of her husband who supplanted him in her affections, interspersed with personal reflection. This criticism is only really interrupted when he reflects that she will eventually have a child, and will be more concerned with her child than about the protagonist. The protagonist promptly continues his angry tirade, this time directed at the mother–child relationship.\n\nThe protagonist seeks escape from his depression by thinking he might immerse himself in some sort of work that would distract him, but finds this impossible, saying:\n\nTo be free of his depression, the protagonist continues into a grand description of the world to come, which he views as somewhat utopian. He relapses into anger briefly again when he hears a bugle call from his comrades telling him to hurry up.\n\nTennyson also predicts the rise of both civil aviation and military aviation in the following words:\n\nIn the 20th century, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Slessor was to use Tennyson's expression \"the central blue\" as the title for his autobiography.\n\nMuch of the remainder of the poem is built up of an odd contrast between the beauty of civilisation and the beauty of the noble savage. He recalls the land where he was born (which he only says is somewhere in the Orient), and lovingly notes its lack of civilisation, describing it as \"Summer isles of Eden\" and \"knots of Paradise.\"\n\nIn the end, he rejects the ideal of the noble savage, preferring the progress that civilisation has made. He also immediately thereafter turns his back on Locksley Hall, and marches forth to meet his comrades.\n\nTennyson neither identifies the protagonist as a hero nor an anti-hero. The first half of the poem portrays him as a victim, but the second reveals that the protagonist holds views that are now recognised as remarkably racist and sexist; for example:\n\nThis is contrasted however with Tennyson's known feminist views, making a lot of his similar works a satire on men of the views he wrote about.\n\nThe narrator is also remarkably emotionally volatile through the poem. A good example occurs when he reminisces about his love for his cousin Amy; while recalling the wonderful experiences of love, he immediately becomes infuriated with her, even going so far as to throw insults:\n\nIn the narrator, Tennyson captures and displays many strong emotions—placid insightfulness, wonder, love, jealousy, despair, and eventually a sort of catharsis. Tennyson also uses the narrator to speculate on what the world might become: he presents a vision of human advance and conflict, of aerial commerce and combat, resolving in a world of federation, peace, and universal law. As many of these predictions have since been realised, Tennyson's work now seems prescient in many ways.\n\nThe historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., writing in the \"Wall Street Journal,\" quoted the poem to illustrate \"a noble dream\" that modern US policy decisions may have been neglecting, and he also stated that Winston Churchill considered it \"the most wonderful of modern prophecies\" and Harry S. Truman carried the words in his wallet.\n\nLord Tennyson wrote a sequel to Locksley Hall in 1886, \"Locksley Hall Sixty Years After\". In the sequel Tennyson describes how the industrialised nature of Britain has failed to fulfil the expectations of the poem of 1842.\n\nA line in \"Locksley Hall\" would inspire the title of the historian Paul Kennedy's 2006 book on the United Nations, \"The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations\".\n\nLocksley Hall was parodied, not without beauty, to the foxhunter at least, by the Victorian English foxhunting MP William Bromley Davenport (1821–1884) in his poem \"Lowesby Hall\", named after a famous hunting seat in Leicestershire, the pre-eminent fox-hunting county. It describes the revived emotion in a jaded and spend-thrift city MP as he recalls the excitement of his youth foxhunting in Leicestershire, and foresees the end of his Victorian aristocratic society:\n\nlater:\n\nIn a scene from the American film \"Marathon Man\", graduate student Thomas \"Babe\" Levy (portrayed by actor Dustin Hoffman) attends an exclusive seminar at Columbia University. During the seminar, his irritable professor, played by Fritz Weaver, quotes the line \"Let us hush this cry of 'Forward' till ten thousand years have gone\" from \"Locksley Hall Sixty Years After\" and then asks if anyone recognises it. Hoffman's character is the only one who does (he writes down the title in his notes) but does not reveal this to the class. The professor calls him out on this after dismissing the other students.\n\nIn the television programme \"\", the dedication plaque of the \"USS. Voyager\" quotes from the poem:\n\"For I dipt in to the future, far as human eye could see; Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be.\"\n\nTrack two of the album Exit by electronic music ensemble Tangerine Dream is called \"Pilots of Purple Twilight\" in homage --- as discussed in the Wikipedia entry on the band, British poetry was an extramusical source of inspiration, particularly to band leader Edgar Froese.\n\n\"Locksley Hall\" is also the source of the title of Colum McCann's 2009 novel, \"Let the Great World Spin\".\n\nAlso, it includes one of the most famous lines in all of English poetry, the last of the following four, albeit very few are aware of the poem whence it came, and it is often, perhaps usually, misquoted:\n\nJames Thurber illustrated this poem for \"Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated\".\n\nElizabeth Gaskell mentions the poem in her 1853 novel \"Cranford\". Lines from it are quoted in the 2007 adaptation of the novel.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13460892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13460892", "title": "Operation Sandcastle", "text": "Operation Sandcastle\n\nOperation Sandcastle was a United Kingdom non-combat military operation conducted between 1955–1956. Its purpose was to dispose of chemical weapons by dumping them in the sea.\n\nThe British possessed almost 71,000 air-dropped bombs of 250 kilograms in weight, each of which was filled with tabun. These had been seized from German ammunition dumps during the final months of World War II. A total of 250,000 tons of German chemical weapons had been discovered, the majority of which were destroyed because they comprised warfare agents which the allies already possessed in great abundance e.g. mustard gas. However, the stocks of tabun and sarin were considered more valuable because the allies did not possess nerve agent technology at that time. As a result, captured stocks of German nerve agents were divided between Britain and the United States after discussion, with the Americans taking the sarin. The British transferred their 14,000 tons of ordnance containg tabun in October 1945, via Hamburg and Newport, to temporary storage at the RAF strategic reserve ammunition store at Llanberis. Longer term facilities were prepared at RAF Llandwrog where the bombs were to be stored in stacks, out in the open, on the runways of the disused airfield. The intention was that any leaks of nerve agent would be dispersed by the prevailing winds. The bombs were transported to Llandwrog by truck from August 1946 to July 1947.\n\nIn July 1947 it was discovered that the bombs were fuzed and a number of them were leaking nerve agent. The fact that the bombs had fuzes inserted meant that they were inherently unsafe: to reduce the risk of accidental detonation, standard practice is to avoid installing the fuze in any air-dropped bomb until shortly before it is loaded onto an aircraft to be used in combat. For similar reasons bomb fuzes are always stored separately, well away from bombs. Unfortunately, this was not the case with the 250 kilogram tabun bombs at RAF Landwrog. Not only had the bombs been left with fuzes inserted for a considerable amount of time (possibly years), but they were also left exposed to the elements creating a corrosion risk, together with the inevitable temperature fluctuations which resulted from changing weather. None of these factors were accepted practice regarding the safe, long-term storage of bomb fuzes or explosive ordnance in general.\n\nAt a rate of 500 bombs a week they were defuzed and individually coated in a waxy preservative to seal them. Seventy-two irreparable devices were neutralised on-site by being drained into individual pits filled with caustic soda crystals. Despite being given a preservative covering the bombs continued to suffer in the damp Welsh climate and in 1951 twenty-one 'Bellman' hangars were erected on the site to store the bombs. Finally in June 1954 it was decided to dispose of the entire stock because by then it was recognised that not only did the weapons have no military value but they had actually become a liability, which could only become worse as time passed.\n\nOperation Sandcastle was divided into two sections, a sea voyage to Cairnryan and then a transfer to suitable hulks there for later sinking north-west of Ireland beyond the continental shelf. It was intended to process 16,000 bombs in the first attempt in mid-1955.\n\nThe work began with the construction of a road between Llandwrog and the nearby port of Fort Belan where six tank landing craft were assembled. Loading trials in June indicated only 400 bombs could be loaded on each craft, fewer than hoped. It was then decided to remove the tail-fins from the bombs to reduce their length, and to pack them in new boxes. This work increased each craft's load to 800 bombs and by mid-July all 16,000 devices had been safely carried to Cairnryan.\n\nThe was the first scuttling ship. Its loading began in late June, and by 23 July all 16,000 bombs were aboard, although an ill-considered loading plan had given it a noticeable list to starboard. The three scuttling charges of TNT were positioned to ensure its sinking would be steady and flat, and the nine-man crew embarked. Departure was delayed by industrial action on the Firth of Clyde preventing the departure of the ocean-going tugboat \"Forester\".\n\nOn 25 July 1955 the SS \"Empire Claire\", SS \"Forester\", and navy escorts \"Mull\" and \"Sir Walter Campbell\" left Cairnryan. The \"Empire Claire\" soon broke down and was taken under tow. They reached the scuttling point () in the early morning of 27 July, but waited until 10:00am for the arrival of an RAF photo-reconnaissance aircraft to observe the operation. The initial two scuttling charges blew and dramatically increased the vessel's starboard list, forcing the use of the emergency charge to open its stern and cause it to sink rapidly, bows up, to a depth of around .\n\nThe later sinking went without any problems. MV \"Vogtland\" was scuttled on 30 May 1956 at the same site, taking 28,737 bombs with it, and on 21 July 1956 the SS \"Kotka\" was sunk (at ) with 26,000 bombs, 330 tons of arsenial compounds, and three tons of toxic seed dressings.\n\n"}

Advances in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, including the rise of the Internet, are major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities. Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization, economics, socio-cultural resources, and the natural environment.\n\nGlobal studies – interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary academic study of globalizing forces and trends. Global studies may include the investigation of one or more aspects of globalization, but tend to concentrate on how globalizing trends are redefining the relationships between states, organizations, societies, communities, and individuals, creating new challenges that cannot be solved by nations or markets alone. Study of the factors contributing to globalization may originate in many academic concentrations, such as political science, economics, sociology, and many others.\n\nHistory of globalization – generally broken-down into three periods: Archaic, Proto-globalization, and Modern.\n\n\nLinks below are to articles, unless otherwise specified.\n\nSince globalization is not an independent phenomenon but is highly interrelated with world views, products, ideas, and other aspects of culture, explanations of why globalization occurs and what the effects of globalization are or can be expected are related to theories ranging from economic development to revolutionary socialism.\n\n\nInternational business development and the organization of business and trade worldwide are fundamental aspects of globalization and the development of globalizing systems.\n\n\nEconomic globalization\nEconomic globalization – increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-border movement of goods, services, technology, and capital. International economic activities and institutions that influence or characterize economic globalization include:\n\n\nAll aspects of globalization are essentially sociocultural in nature. Here, aspects of the globalization of culture are detailed, including cultural diversity, cultural homogenization and its backlash, as well as multiculturalism, multilingualism, global civics, world governance and other political developments and social movements related to globalization.\n\n\nAlong with the globalization of business comes a new spatial division of labor, which occurs when production processes are no longer confined to national economies and labor becomes sourced from different parts of the globe. This global workforce has implications ranging from immigration policy to basic human and labor rights.\n\n\nThe natural environment can be contrasted with the built environment, comprising the areas and components that are strongly influenced by humans. In the age of globalization, few \"absolutely natural\" environments remain. Human challenges to the natural environment, such as climate change, cross-boundary water and air pollution, over-fishing of the ocean, and the spread of invasive species require at least transnational and, often, global solutions.\n\n\nProcesses of globalization present humankind with many issues that are considered problematic in at least one culture or society, and often multiple societies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29481936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29481936", "title": "SS State of Burgundy", "text": "SS State of Burgundy\n\nThe SS state of Burgundy (in German: «SS-Staat Burgund») or Order-State of Burgundy (in German: «Ordensstaat Burgund», a historical reference to the State of the Teutonic Order) was a proposed state which the leadership of Nazi Germany hoped to create in certain areas of Western Europe during World War II.\n\nThe name \"Burgundy\" itself (derived from the Burgundians, an ancient Germanic tribe) is a vague term, geographically speaking. A wide number of different countries and regions throughout history have been referred to by this name or controlled by a Burgundy-based state.\n\nThe most outspoken proponent of re-creating a German-controlled Burgundian state was Heinrich Himmler, leader of the SS. According to Himmler, Burgundy, which he called \"an ancient economic and cultural centre\", had been \"reduced to nothing more than a French appendage, known only for its wine production\". This plan entailed the transformation of Burgundy into a model-state nominally located outside of the Greater German Reich, but nevertheless ruled by a National Socialist government, and which would also have its own army, laws, and postal services. It was supposed to encompass French Switzerland (Romandy), Picardy with Amiens, the Champagne district with Reims and Troyes, the Franche-Comté with Dijon, Chalons, and Nevers, Hainaut and Luxembourg (Belgium). It was also to have a connection to both the Mediterranean Sea as well as the English Channel. The capital and administrative seat was tentatively proposed as either Dijon or Nancy (\"Nanzig\") as its capital. Its official language was to become German, but would initially be also French.\n\nWhether these were merely the dreams of Himmler personally or, as he so claimed, enjoyed Hitler’s full support is inconclusive from the historical record. Hitler's own objective towards France was to eliminate it permanently as a strategic threat to German security. The 1940 campaign in Western Europe was in fact carried out entirely so that its western flank could be secured before Germany would commit its armies to conquering \"Lebensraum\" in the Soviet Union. With this in mind, extensive plans were made so that France could be reduced to a minor state and a permanent German vassal kept firmly in the state of dependence that she had found herself in after the 1940 armistice and which it would thus have no further reason to fear.\n\nAt Hitler’s request a plan was produced after the fall of France in 1940 that would provide for the outright annexation into Germany of a large strip of Eastern France by reducing it to its late medieval borders with the Holy Roman Empire. This memo, produced by the Reich Interior Ministry forms the basis for the so-called \"northeast line\" which separated the 'forbidden zone' of German occupied France from the rest of the areas under military control. It proposed the deportation of its French inhabitants and the settlement of a million German peasants. He considered these areas, as well as Wallonia to be \"in reality German\" and should therefore be re-integrated.\n\nIn 1942 Hitler did mention that the former area of the Kingdom of Burgundy, which France \"had taken from Germany in her weakest moment\" would also have to be annexed to Nazi Germany \"after\" the incorporation of the forbidden zone, but to which areas he referred by this statement remains unclear.\n\nThere were also proposals for an independent Brittany state. Hitler himself mentioned this intention on at least one occasion to his military leaders, but ultimately seemed to have taken little interest in the project.\n\n"}

It is located at the confluence of three rivers - Bukovica, Bijela and Šavnik, at an altitude of 840 meters. It is the lowest lying settlement in the municipality.\n\nUnlike most settlements in the area, which date back several centuries, Šavnik is relatively new, founded only in 1861. It was populated by migrants from other parts of Montenegro and Herzegovina, mostly craftsmen, merchants, riflers and blacksmiths, which were needed by local farmers. The area was overgrown with willows, which the newly formed town was named after (šavice – willow branches or seams, which were used as a roof covering). \n\nBefore the construction of first houses on the site of today's town, there were two mills on Šavnik River. The first three houses that were built in Šavnik were a tavern with a shop, rifle repair shop and a blacksmith shop. The town quickly became a center for the Drobnjaci region, and incorporated a post office, school, primary court, and military post.\n\nIndustrialization during the SFR Yugoslavia era mostly bypassed Šavnik, so did all major transit road or rail links, and economy of town went into stagnation. Population of Šavnik and entire municipality is since in slow but steady decline. Most of the residents are migrating to Nikšić and southern Montenegro, and Šavnik is often a synonym for a poor and deteriorating town.\n\nThe new road Risan - Nikšić - Šavnik - Žabljak (P5), and proximity of Žabljak as a main mountain tourist resort in Montenegro may boost Šavnik's economic prospects.\n\nŠavnik is situated on a regional road halfway between Nikšić and Žabljak, and it is its only link with the rest of Montenegro.\n\nŠavnik is administrative centre of Šavnik municipality, which in 2011 had a population of 2,070.
