The AUF advocates for transformation of Africa into a federation, with the Pan African Parliament as the highest government, overseeing key institutions including a single currency, and one all-African army. The AUF promoted the creation of the African Union in the mid-1990s and continues to advocate for an end to neocolonialism. It has also been active in campaigns against abuses by the diamond industry, weapons traders, and unfair terms of trade in the coffee industry.\n\nThe AUF National Committee is the body that elects the AUF president. The AUF Executive Committee is the body that implements policies and oversees the day-to-day administration of the AUF. AUF has been responsible for initiating and organizing several strategies, including the AUF's Fairtrade Coffee Campaign that pushed for reforms in the coffee industry.\n\nThe AUF, also known as the African Front, consists of a worldwide network of supporters, who believe that Africa must be unified into a federation as a means of securing peace and an end to wars and poverty. Although most members of the AUF are Africans, membership is open to non-Africans.\n\nOther past AUF leaders have been Fesseha Demessae who served as Deputy Secretary General and Director of Cultural Affairs, and former vice-president Mongezi Sefika wa Nkomo.\n\nKirimi Kaberia was the first president of the AUF. Mouhamed Taofic Youssouf served briefly as AUF president, after Kirimi Kaberia accepted a posting as deputy ambassador for Kenya in Washington DC, USA.\n\nFollowing the creation of the Pan African Parliament, the AUF became the first All-African (continental) political party. Several PAP members are also members and supporters of the AUF.\n\nAUF members who have served in the Pan African Parliament include Dr. Amani Walid Kabourou from Tanzania, Chrispin Mwitila Shumina from Zambia, and Loyce Bwambale from Uganda.

These functioned as effective monopolies for a particular good or labor.\n\nThe term \"corporation\" was used as late as the 18th century in England to refer to such ventures as the East India Company or the Hudson's Bay Company: commercial organizations that operated under royal patent to have exclusive rights to a particular area of trade. In the medieval town, however, corporations were a conglomeration of interests that existed either as a development from, or in competition with, guilds. The most notable corporations were in trade and banking.\n\nThe effects of a corporation were similar to a monopoly. On the one hand, the ability to have sole access to markets meant that the business was encouraged (e.g., the ability to be an exclusive trader provided an incentive to the East India Company to accept financial risks in exploration) and the negative effects of competition were avoided (to take the same example, exclusive patents cut down on merchants sponsoring piracy). Innovation was stifled, however, and prices were unregulated. (In the case of patent corporations, the town or monarch was ostensibly able to regulate prices by revoking the patent, but this rarely occurred.)\n"}

These courts sit in each of the ten provinces and in the Brussels capital territory. Unlike the other courts, which have a permanent structure, a Court of Assize has to be constituted for each specific case. It comprises three professional judges and 12 jurors.\n\nThe presiding judge is to be a judge at a Court of Appeal and is assisted by two judges of Courts of First Instance. The jury invariably consists of twelve members, who are balloted out of the citizens having the right to vote at elections and ageing between thirty and sixty, and they must be able to read and write. In addition, it is possible to call up one to twelve alternate jurors. Only the jury decides upon the facts, and with the judges the penalty is determined. There is no appeal for the verdicts, apart from one before the Court of Cassation.\n\nMainly handling murder cases, it is the only court constitutionally authorized to judge delicts regarding the freedom of the press – though few practical cases have been considered to involve an infliction on that freedom and thus nearly all incidents were tried by lower courts.\n\n"}

{"id": "3761564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3761564", "title": "Duchy of Amalfi", "text": "Duchy of Amalfi\n\nThe Duchy of Amalfi (, ) or the Republic of Amalfi () was a \"de facto\" independent state centered on the Southern Italian city of Amalfi during the 10th and 11th centuries. The city and its territory were originally part of the larger \"ducatus Neapolitanus\", governed by a patrician, but it extracted itself from Byzantine vassalage and first elected a duke (or doge) in 958. During the 10 and 11 centuries Amalfi was estimated to have a population of 50,000 -70,000 people. It rose to become an economic powerhouse, a commercial center whose merchants dominated Mediterranean and Italian trade for a century before being surpassed and superseded by the other maritime republics of the North, like Pisa, Venice, and Genoa. In 1073, Amalfi lost its independence and fell to the Normans, from whose yoke it failed in two separate attempts to free itself.\n\nThe city of Amalfi was founded as a trading post in 339. Its first bishop was appointed in 596. In 838, the city was captured by Sicard of Benevento with help from traitors within the city, who led him in through the waterward defenses. Many of the Amalfitans in Salerno sacked that city and left. In 839, Amalfi freed itself from Lombard domination and elected a prefect. Nearby Atrani participated in these early prefectural elections. Subsequently, Amalfi helped to free Siconulf to oppose the ruling Prince of Benevento. In 897, the self-governing republic, still nominally tied to the Byzantine Empire, was defeated in a war with Sorrento, supported by Naples, in which her prefect was captured, later ransomed. In 914, the prefect Mastalus I was appointed first judge. In 903 the Amalfitans joined forces with Naples to attack the Arabs that had established them selves on the banks of the Garigliano river. However the combined forces of Amalfi and the Naples were driven back by the Arabs and their allies, the Italian city state of Gaeta. In 915 Amalfi did not join the Battle of Garigliano to fight against the Arabs. This was most likely due to the fact that since 909 Amalfi had been heavily trading with the Fatimid Caliphate and did not want to jeopardize relations with this powerful trade partner. In 958, Mastalus II was assassinated and Sergius I was elected first duke (or doge). From 981 to 983, Amalfi ruled the Principality of Salerno. In 987, the Amalfitan bishopric was raised to archiepiscopal status.\n\nFrom 1034, Amalfi came under the control of the Principality of Capua and, in 1039, that of Salerno. In 1073, Robert Guiscard conquered the city and took the title \"dux Amalfitanorum\": \"duke of the Amalfitans.\" In 1096, Amalfi revolted, but this was put down in 1101. It revolted again in 1130 and was finally subdued in 1131, when the Emir John marched on Amalfi by land and George of Antioch blockaded the town by sea and set up a base on Capri. In 1135 and 1137, Pisa sacked the city and the glory of Amalfi was past.\n\nThe Arab traveller Ibn Hawqal, writing in 977 during the great reign of Manso I, described Amalfi as:\nThe title \"Duke of Amalfi\" was revived in the later 14th century as a title used within the Kingdom of Naples.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote these lines in a poem titled Amalfi in 1869.<poem>\nWhere are now the freighted barks\nFrom the marts of east and west?\nWhere the knights in iron sarks\nJourneying to the Holy Land,\n\nWhere the merchants with their wares,\nAnd their gallant brigantines\n\nVanished like a fleet of cloud,\nLike a passing trumpet-blast,\nAre those splendors of the past,\nAnd the commerce and the crowd!\n</poem>\n\nThe poem is about medieval Amalfi. and it references the crusades and its important maritime history.\n\nAfter the Amalfitans broke free of Lombard control they did not return to Neapolitan control but instead stated their independence. After 839 Amalfi was an independent entity and created a strong maritime presence. Amalfi had strong ties with both the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate. The Amalfitans had a permanent and important presence in Constantinople during the 10 and 11 centuries. Amalfitans also created Latin Christian outposts in the Levant around 1040 and hostels for Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem and Antioch. During the 10 and 11 centuries Amalfi was dominating trade and commerce with North Africa and the Levant, and one of the major exports from Amalfi during the Middle Ages was the chestnut.\n\nWhile The Duchy of Amalfi never regained its independence after 1137 the city of Amalfi was still important to maritime trade for the next 200 years until 1343 when an earthquake and a storm destroyed most of its harbor. Probably the most important contribution Amalfi made during those 200 years before its harbor was destroyed was the perfection of the modern day box compass. Between 1295 and 1302 the Flavio Gioia turned the compass from a needle floating in water to what we use today, a round box with a compass card that rotates 360 degrees attached to a magnetic element.\n\n\n"}

According to data provided by \"The Wall Street Journal\", the retail market for surveillance tools has grown from \"nearly zero\" in 2001 to about US$5 billion in 2011. The size of the video surveillance market rose to US$13.5 billion in 2012, and is expected to reach US$39 billion by 2020.\n\nFueled by widespread fears of terrorist attacks, the future of surveillance is particularly promising in the field of video content analysis, where computers analyze live camera feeds to count the number of people, register temperature changes, and automatically identify suspicious behavior via statistical algorithms. The following terrorist attacks have led to a significant increase in street-level surveillance:\n\n\nPrivate intelligence agencies are non-governmental corporations involved in the collection and analysis of information. Prior to the 9/11 attacks, such tasks were mostly performed by governmental agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the gathering of intelligence was rapidly outsourced by the U.S. government to private intelligences agencies, which function as independent contractors.\n\nAccording to \"The Washington Post\", about one in four U.S. intelligence workers are contractors, and over 70 percent of the budget of the United States Intelligence Community is earmarked for payment to private firms. An examination by The Post found that 1,931 private companies work on programs related to intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States.\n\nThe average annual cost of a contract employee is US$250,000, almost twice that of a federal employee.\n\nStrategic Forecasting, Inc., more commonly known as Stratfor, is a global intelligence company founded in 1996 in Austin, Texas. It offers information to governments and private clients including Dow Chemical Company, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nIn 2012–13, over 5 million internal e-mails from Stratfor were released by WikiLeaks.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton is a publicly traded company that is majority-owned by The Carlyle Group, a global asset management firm specializing in private equity, based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1914 by Edwin G. Booz, Booz Allen Hamilton became one of the most profitable private contractors by supplying tens of thousands of intelligence analysts to the U.S. federal government. During the fiscal year of 2013, Booz Allen Hamilton derived 99% of its income from the government, and the largest portion of its revenue (16%) came from the U.S. Army. Half of its employees carry top secret security clearances. In the first half of 2013, Booz Allen Hamilton has won numerous contracts, including:\n\n\nIn 2006, Booz Allen Hamilton was recognized by \"Fortune\" magazine as one of the \"100 Best Companies to Work For\". In 2013, Booz Allen Hamilton was hailed by Bloomberg Businessweek as \"the World's Most Profitable Spy Organization\".\n\nCommercial mass surveillance often makes use of copyright laws and \"user agreements\" to obtain (typically uninformed) 'consent'\nto surveillance from consumers who use their software or other related materials. This allows gathering of information which would be technically illegal if performed\nby government agencies. This data is then often shared with government agencies - thereby - in practice - defeating the purpose of such privacy protections.\n\nReporters Without Borders' March 2013 \"Special report on Internet Surveillance\" contained a list of \"Corporate Enemies of the Internet\", companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information. The five companies on the initial list were: Amesys (France), Blue Coat Systems (U.S.), Gamma (UK and Germany), Hacking Team (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany), but the list was not exhaustive and is likely to be expanded in the future.\n\n"}

{"id": "7538464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7538464", "title": "Rainbowing", "text": "Rainbowing\n\nRainbowing is the process in which a dredging ship propels sand that has been claimed from the ocean floor in a high arc to a particular location. This is used for multiple purposes, ranging from building up a beach to prevent erosion to constructing new islands. The name is derived from the appearance of the arc, which closely resembles a brown-colored rainbow.\n\nThis technique was used extensively in the construction of the Palm Islands and The World, Dubai.\n\nThe process of rainbowing begins with the excavation of sediment, typically sand, from the seabed by a dredger. Dredgers excavate the sediment using mechanical or hydraulic methods or a combination of both. During the excavation process, large quantities of water are collected along with sediment creating a mixture called slurry. The slurry can then be utilised on-site or transported to where it will be deposited. The liquid characteristics of the slurry allow the dredger to transfer the slurry by ejecting it through the air in arcs.\n\nThe projection of slurry for beach nourishment and other dredging uses is achieved through the use of nozzles which affect the output and trajectory of the slurry. \n\nThe diameter of the nozzle affects the output of the dredger and the distance that the slurry is projected. Smaller diameters, for instance, have less flow leading to lower hourly output, but are able to project the slurry over a further distance due to a higher exit velocity. Jumbo dredgers today can easily achieve distances in excess of 150 metres, but at the cost of 30% extra discharge time.\n\nNozzles that are angled 30° from the horizontal are standard. Although 45° nozzle angles achieve longer distances from a ballistics perspective, 45° nozzles have been observed to create large craters. In addition, a high amount of sand flows back towards the dredger. 30° nozzles instead project the sand with a flatter trajectory, minimizing back flow while achieving a final distance comparable to that reached by a 45° nozzle.\n\nOther methods of disposing and transferring the slurry include pumping the slurry through pipelines or using natural forces such as wave currents.\n\nSince rainbowing transfers material by ejecting it through the air, the technique is useful for reclaiming areas that are too shallow for direct placement. In addition, rainbowing allows the dredger to dispose excavated sediment on-site. This is useful for dredging operations such as creating trenches since the dredger can simply cast the excavated sediment to the side as opposed to spending time dumping or transporting the collected sediment. This allows for a continuous trenching operation.\n\nRainbowing, along with other dredging and reclamation methods, has various effects on the environment apart from vastly changing its geographical structure.\n\nThroughout the dredging and nourishment process, plumes of fine sediment, which can take longer to settle, can remain suspended in the water for long periods of time. These clouds of fine sediment can have adverse effects on the ecosystem, asphyxiating fish and other fauna as well as blocking sunlight. As organisms die, the water becomes toxic as decomposed organic materials raise hydrogen sulfide levels. In such cases, it is often impossible for an ecosystem to revive. It often takes a couple years for the ecosystem to recover, when recovery does occur. In addition, coral can be removed or become buried by the sediment. \n"}

SPI is focused on countries in the developing world, more particularly those that are not part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as well as Mexico, Greece and Turkey. SPI seeks to encourage and develop sustainable economic development in the communities surrounding archaeological sites by aiding in the development of locally owned businesses that maximize the spending of dollars in these communities and regions. Some manufacturing industries are aided as well, including local artisans. SPI's projects provide a two-for-the-price-of-one benefit: they create viable economic opportunities for the local residents while saving archaeological sites for future generations to study and enjoy.\n\nAccording to Felix Salmon of Reuters, SPI is about taking archaeological sites \"in poor countries and making them generate cash for the locals — thereby giving them a real monetary incentive (rather than a high-minded lecture) aimed at preserving archeological treasures.\" In an article on job creation, Salmon cites SPI as a model for maximum job creation through small investments: \"In general, if you want to create the maximum number of jobs for the smallest amount of money, the best way of doing so is to provide catalytic capital which helps to give a small business the step-up it needs to sustain new jobs on a permanent basis\". In a recent report, the Milken Institute called for the adoption of SPI's model by the state of Israel in order to better protect that country's cultural heritage.

This signal ceased at the end of 2016, but the transmitter remains in use for its time signal and other digital signals.\n\nIn 1980, the first atomic clock was installed to regulate the carrier frequency. The current time signal is generated by an extremely accurate caesium fountain atomic clock and phase-modulated on the 162 kHz carrier in a way that is inaudible when listening to the France Inter signal using a normal AM receivers. It requires a more complex receiver than the popular DCF77 service, but the much more powerful transmitter (22 to 40 times DCF77's 50 kW) gives it a much greater range of 3,500 km.\n\nThe signal is almost continuous but there is a regularly scheduled interruption for maintenance every Tuesday. This used to be from 01:03 to 05:00, but with the cessation of audio signals, it has been moved to 08:00 to 12:00.\n\nThe signal was formerly 2,000 kW, but has been reduced to 1,500 kW, and tests are in progress of a further reduction to 1,100 kW for cost savings.\n\nTéléDiffusion de France (TDF) uses an amplitude modulated longwave transmitter station. Time signals are transmitted by phase-modulating the carrier by ±1 radian in 0.1 s every second except the 59th second of each minute. This modulation pattern is repeated to indicate a binary one.\n\nThe binary encoding of date and time data during seconds 15 through 59 is identical to that of DCF77; the numbers of the minute, hour, day of the month, day of the week, month and year are transmitted each minute from the 21st to the 58th second, in accordance with the French legal time scale. The time transmitted is the local time of the upcoming minute.\n\nAlso like DCF77, bit 20 is always 1, bit 18 indicates that local time is UTC+1 (CET), bit 17 indicates that local time is UTC+2 (CEST), and bit 16 indicates that a change to local time will take place at the end of the current hour. Bit 15 is reserved to indicate abnormal transmitter operation.\n\nAs extensions to the DCF77 code, bit 14 is set during public holidays (14 July, Christmas, etc.), and bit 13 is set the day before public holidays.\n\nUnlike DCF77, bit 19 is not used for leap second warnings, but is always zero. Instead, bit 1 is used to warn of a positive leap second, and bit 2 is used to warn of a (very unlikely) negative leap second. In case of a leap second, an additional zero bit is inserted between bits 2 and 3. This is supposed to be inserted at 23:59:03, during minute 59 of the hour (during which the timestamp for minute :00 is transmitted), so that the minute markers are all broadcast at the correct times, but for the leap second at the end of December 2016, it was apparently inserted at 23:58:03.\n\nThe relative uncertainty of the carrier frequency is 2 parts in 10.\nOne signal element consists of the phase of the carrier shifted linearly by +1 rad in 25 ms (known as \"ramp A\"), then shifted linearly by −2 rad over 50 ms (\"ramp B\"), then shifted linearly again by +1 rad for another 25 ms (\"ramp C\"), returning the phase to zero. One signal element is always sent at each second between 0 and 58. Two signal elements are sent in sequence to represent a binary one; otherwise it is interpreted as binary zero. During ramp B of the initial signal element, the exact point the signal phase is at zero represents the top of the UTC second. Since the phase is the integral of the frequency, this triangular phase modulation at 40 rad/s corresponds to a square frequency modulation with a deviation of 20/\"π\" ≈ 6.37 Hz.\n\nBoth the average phase and the average frequency deviation are thus zero. Additional non-timing data is sent by phase modulation during the rest of each second. But the second marker (and data bit) is always preceded by 100 ms without any phase modulation. The signal is not phase-modulated at all during the 59th second past the minute.\n\n\n"}

Most European countries use summer time and harmonise their summer time adjustments. See Summer time in Europe for details.\n\nThe time zones actually in use in Europe differ significantly from uniform zoning based purely on longitude, as used for example under the nautical time system. The world could in theory be divided into 24 time zones, each of 15 degrees of longitude. However, due to geographical and cultural factors it is not practical to divide the world so evenly, and actual time zones may differ significantly from those based purely on longitude. In Europe, the widespread use of Central European Time (CET) causes major variations in some areas from solar time. Based on solar time, CET would range from 7.5 to 22.5°E. However, for example Spain (almost entirely in the Western hemisphere) and France (almost entirely west of 7.5°E, as illustrated in the map below) should theoretically use UTC, as they did before the Second World War. The general result is a solar noon which is much later than clock noon, and later sunrises and sunsets than should theoretically happen. The Benelux countries should also theoretically use GMT.\n\nRussia and Belarus observed \"permanent summer time\" between March 2011 and October 2014. Since October 2014 Russia has observed \"permanent winter time\". Iceland can be considered to be on \"de facto\" permanent summer time because, since 1968, it uses UTC time all year, despite being located more than 15° west of the prime meridian. It should therefore be located in UTC−1, but chooses to remain closer to continental European time, resulting in legal times significantly in advance of local solar time; this is of little practical significance owing to the wide variations in daylight hours in that country.\n\nThe European Commission has proposed ending the practice of Summer time in the EU and EFTA countries in 2019. However, the decision lies with the EU's Member States as a group. \n\nOf the 28 EU member states:\n\nNorway, Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, San Marino, Vatican City, Andorra, Monaco and Liechtenstein also observe Central European Time. \n\nNorthern Cyprus and Transnistria observe Eastern European Time.\nAzores in Portugal observes the Atlantic/Azores Time (UTC−1 with Daylight saving time in the summer). \n\nIceland observes the Western European Time.\n\nMoldova, Kaliningrad Oblast (Kaliningrad Time) and Ukraine (apart from Crimea) observe the Eastern European Time. \n\nBelarus, Russia (western part, including Crimea) and Turkey use Further-eastern European Time. \nGeorgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh follow different Time Zones, including Samara Time, Yekaterinburg Time, the Asian Time Zones of Russia, (Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan including Nagorno-Karabakh), (Kazakhstan).\nLondon and others:\n"}
