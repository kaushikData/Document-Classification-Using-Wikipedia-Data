The channel also dubbed cartoons in Japanese language. A subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan and Mitsui & Co.'s joint venture AK Holdings, it is headquartered in in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, with its co-founders and shareholders including Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan and the noted anime studios Sunrise, Toei Animation, TMS Entertainment and production company NAS.\n\nAnimax is the first and largest 24-hour network in the world dedicated to anime.\n\nAnimax operates as separate 24-hour TV channels for Japan, Asia (four separate feeds for South East Asia, Philippines, Hong Kong and Taiwan) and South Korea, in addition to VOD platforms in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In India Animax is available online as live channel via Sony LIV.\n\nEstablished on May 20, 1998 by Sony, originally premiered in Japan on July 1, the same year, across the SKY PerfecTV! satellite television platform. Headquartered in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, and presided by Masao Takiyama, Animax's shareholders and founders include Sony Pictures Entertainment (Japan), Sunrise, Toei Animation, TMS Entertainment, and NAS. Its founders also include noted anime producer and production designer Yoshirō Kataoka. The network began broadcasting in high definition from October 2009.\n\nAnimax also exhibits affiliations with anime pioneer Osamu Tezuka's Tezuka Productions company, Pierrot, Nippon Animation, and numerous others. It has produced and exclusively premiered several anime in Japan, such as \"\", \"Ultra Maniac\", \"Astro Boy\", \"\", \"Aishiteruze Baby\", and many others, including Madhouse's anime adaptations of Marvel's \"Iron Man,\" \"Wolverine\", and \"X-Men\".\n\nNoted Japanese celebrities and personalities to have appeared on Animax with their own programs, include actress Natsuki Katō, among numerous others. The network's narrators are the voice actors Yukari Tamura and Kōsuke Okano, and from October 2007, Sayuri Yahagi. Animax also hosts and organizes several anime-based competitions across Japan, such as the Animax Taishō scriptwriting competition and Animax Anison Grand Prix anime song music competition, which are judged by a panel of noted anime figures, as well as several events and concerts across Japan, such as the annual , an annual live concert during which renowned Japanese bands, artists and voice actors perform to a live audience, often held at Zepp Tokyo.\n\nApart from operating its business primarily as a television network, Animax has also begun operating a mobile television service. In February 2007, Animax announced that it would be launching a mobile television service of its network on the mobile phone company MOBAHO! from April 2007, having its programming being viewable by the company's mobile phone subscribers.\n\nSince July 2011 a program called \"STUDIO MUSIX\" has been transmitted the first Sunday of every month, featuring popular singer May'n as the MC. In each episode there's a segment of May'n and the guests on an interview and also a live stage featuring them.\n\nCartoon series broadcasts including \"\", \"Transformers Prime\", \"\", \"Yin Yang Yo!\", \"Jackie Chan Adventures\", \"Metalocalypse\", \"Arms Micron\", \"\", \"\", \"Sonic X\" and \"Digimon Adventure\" appear on the network's MorningMax block, which released in 2015.\n\nAnimax launched separate Asian versions of the channel featuring its anime programming within separate networks and feeds in the respective regions and languages beginning in 2004. The first one was launched in Taiwan and the Philippines on January 1, 2004, and in Hong Kong on January 12, 2004. A week later, Animax launched in Southeast Asia on January 19, 2004, featuring its programming within feeds in English audio, as well as Japanese audio, with English subtitling, and other languages in the region, becoming the company's first English-language network.\n\nOn July 5, 2004, Animax started operations across South Asia including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Maldives, featuring its programming within an English-language feed. On April 29, 2006, Animax started its operations in South Korea, broadcasting separately from Seoul. On August 31, 2006, Animax launched its Malaysian feed.\n\nAnimax used the latest logo launched on May 3, 2010, until it reverted to their previous logo sometime in 2013.\n\nAnimax ceased its operations in India and was replaced by Sony Yay on April 18, 2017. The channel later moved to its digital platform Sony LIV in HD and Asian feed instead.\n\nAnimax was launched in Latin America on July 31, 2005, replacing Locomotion after Sony's purchase from Hearst Corporation and Corus Entertainment, in January 2005. The channel's non-anime programming were removed from the lineup, which was later replaced with an all-anime lineup. Animax Latin America began operating across the entire region and broadcasting its anime programming. Unlike Animax's networks in other countries, Animax Latin America was distributed by HBO Latin America Group under license from Sony.\n\nThe network's initial programming lineup consisted of shows that originally aired on Locomotion, which were \"Saber Marionette J\", \"Saber Marionette J to X\", \"Soul Hunter/Senkai-den Hōshin Engi\", \"Serial Experiments Lain\", \"The Candidate for Goddess\" and \"Earth Girl Arjuna\", and newer series such as \"Di Gi Charat Nyo!\", \"Fullmetal Alchemist\", \"GetBackers\", \".hack//Sign\", \"Hellsing\", \"\", \"Hunter × Hunter\", \"Initial D\", \"Last Exile\", \"Lunar Legend Tsukihime\", \"Martian Successor Nadesico\", \"Pita-Ten\", \"The Prince of Tennis\", \"Crayon Shin-chan\", \"Stratos 4\", and \"Vandread\" (which Locomotion intended to air).\n\nOver the years, Animax has aired various anime series, with the Spanish versions being dubbed in Venezuela by Estudios Lain and after in Mexico, and the Portuguese versions dubbed in Brazil, most of whom have never been shown before locally. Its programs include, \"Noir\", \"Wolf's Rain\", \"Twin Spica\", \"Planet Survival\", \"Excel Saga\" (which Locomotion intended to air), \"Samurai 7\", \"Gun Frontier\", \"Gantz\", \"Heat Guy J\", \"Galaxy Angel\", \"Burst Angel\", \"Blood+\", \"Hell Girl\", \"Mushishi\", \"Bleach\", \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" (which previously aired on Locomotion), \"Samurai X\", \"The Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok\", \"Death Note\", \"Fate Stay Night\", \"Black Cat\", \"SoltyRei\", \"R.O.D. The TV\", \"xxxHolic\", \"Bokurano\", \"Humanoid Monster Bem\", \"Speed Grapher\", \"Basilisk\", \"Trinity Blood\", \"Black Jack\", \"\", \"Legend of Blue\", \"009-1\" and \"Musumet\".\n\nStarting January 2007, Animax changed its lineup and some anime series were removed. Animax Latin America announced a new rebrand from August 2007, as well as the premiere of a new adult-oriented programming block (named \"Lollipop\"). Likewise, on March 18, 2008, it was announced that the mobile service Animax Mobile, available on Japan and Australia, was to be launched as well in Mexico and eventually in other Latin American countries.\n\nSince late 2010, Animax Latin America had gradually shifted its focus from anime to more live-action programming, contrary to the network's programming and history in other regions; this led to several fans airing their discontent on the Latin American discussion forums, which were subsequently shut down in January 2011.\n\nAnimax Latin America was rebranded to Sony Spin on May 1, 2011, with anime retained at the late-night slot. By March 2012, anime no longer aired on the channel. Sony Spin was discontinued on July 1, 2014 and replaced with a local version of Lifetime, an American women's interest cable and satellite television network that is owned and operated by Lifetime Entertainment Services, a subsidiary of the A+E Networks joint venture between the Disney–ABC Television Group unit of the Disney Media Networks subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company and Hearst Corporation, which was announced on April 23, 2014 by Sony Pictures Television in association with A+E Networks' Latin American division, which was the company's joint venture with Ole Communications and currently distributed by HBO Latin America Group from its launch down (similar to its predecessor Sony Spin when that channel was known as Animax).\n\nAnimax has sponsored several anime-based events across North America, including hosting an anime festival, in association with other anime distributive enterprises such as Bandai Entertainment and Viz Media, across Sony's San Francisco-based entertainment shopping complex Metreon in October 2001, during which it aired numerous of its anime titles across the centre, including special \"Gundam\", \"The Making of Metropolis\", and \"Love Hina\" screenings.\n\nThe noted international business newspaper \"Financial Times\", reported, in September 2004, of Sony planning and being \"keen\" to launch Animax across the United States and North America, after Sony had signed an agreement with the largest cable company in the United States, Comcast, with whom it had co-partnered in a US$4.8 billion acquisition of legendary Hollywood studio MGM, to bring at least three of Sony's television networks across the region.\n\nOn June 13, 2007, Sony Pictures Television International officially announced that Animax would be launching its mobile television service, Animax Mobile, in Canada from July 2007, on Bell Digital's mobile phone service. This was Animax Mobile's third major expansion, after initially launching the mobile television service in Japan from April 2007 and Australia from June 12, 2007.\n\nOn January 17, 2012, the streaming service Crackle, added Animax to their lineup for the North America region, marking the network's first launch in the United States (although not on television). Its programming has included for the first time several of Animax's English language dubs, including that of shows that had never yet been adapted into English and had only aired in Southeast Asia and South Asia prior, such as \"Nodame Cantabile\", \"Yōkai Ningen Bem\" and several others. Towards the end of 2013, the Animax branding was dropped, though Crackle continues to stream anime titles.\n\nIn April 2007, Animax launched across several countries in Europe, including Hungary, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, with Sony announcing plans to launch in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Poland (put on hiatus) and other major countries in the continent, with discussions at an advanced stage. The launch marked Animax's first major expansion into Europe. The network then soon launched in Germany in May 2007, Spain and Portugal in 2008.\n\nThe channel was closed on 31 March 2014.\n\nIn October 2007, further details emerged on Animax's launch details in the United Kingdom, with Sony Pictures Television International senior-vice president of international networks Ross Hair being quoted by Brand Republic's \"Media Week\" as stating that Sony was preparing to launch Animax in the United Kingdom initially as a video on demand service alongside other Sony television networks, with Sony also looking at launching Animax across the free digital television service Freeview subject to new frequencies and slot being available.\n\nAs of April 2011, one of Sony's 3 channels that they were planning to launch in the UK since 2007, Sony Entertainment Television, is now available there on Sky following Sony's acquisition of channel slots 157 and 190, which were previously owned by Film 24 and Open Access 3, respectively, not only making it now possible that Sony can launch Animax in the UK but also marking Sony Pictures Television's entry into both the British and Irish markets. On October 15, 2013, Sony Pictures Television announced it will launch a UK version of Animax as a SVOD service. SPT also announced a multi-year volume deal with Viz Media to secure exclusive content for the service.\n\nThe SVOD service launched online on October 24, 2013, with three simulcast series and over twenty archive series including many titles which originally debuted on Kaze's Anime On Demand service. Some content has also appeared on Sony Movie Channel's Late Night Anime block, with the channel's website referencing Animax. Starting from March 2014, the Late Night Anime block has since been rebranded to Animax. An app for PlayStation 4 was released in October 2014.\n\nOn March 5, 2015, Scuzz launched \"Animax Movie Nights\", a weekly block that aired anime movies on Thursday nights for the next month.\n\nOn October 15, 2018 the service will be closed down and subscribers are being directed to Funimation \n\nIn 2006, Sony Pictures Television International bought the satellite/cable TV station A+ Anime, re-branding it as Animax in 2007. At first Animax only broadcast series that it had previously purchased, but later bought new series, often with Czech dubbing.\nIn 2010, the channel changed its focus, targeting a more broad young adult audience and adding more American television series. At the same time, the channel dropped support of its forums on its website and, in September 2013, closed them entirely. From the end of 2013, rumors circulated that the channel would be shutting down. On March 31, 2014, the channel was indeed closed down and replaced with C8.\n\nMeanwhile, in Romania, AXN Spin was launched on 1 March 2013 on RomTelecom's digital lineup, a few months after both Minimax and Animax were dropped from that platform. AXN Spin's schedule resembled Animax's schedule from that time, but with Animax closed in March 2014 and with the rights expired for all acquired content, AXN Spin doesn't air anime anymore. It is uncertain the channel's future as the schedule mainly consists in reruns from AXN, AXN Black and AXN White, without any adverts or self-promotions. Interestingly, AXN Spin is also available in Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, countries in which neither AXN Black or AXN White have been launched.\n\nAnimax began as a programming block in Spain and Portugal in the channel AXN. Shows broadcast on the block include \"InuYasha\", \"Outlaw Star\", \"Trigun\", \"Orphen\", \"Excel Saga\" and \"Samurai Champloo\". Later shows include \"Corrector Yui\", \"The Law of Ueki\", \"Detective Conan\", \"Lupin III\" and \"Kochikame\". These shows were shown in Portugal and Spain from October 2007 until September 2008, airing weekends from 13:00 to 16:00.\n\nThe full channel was subsequently launched on April 12, 2008 on the Movistar TV and Digital+ platforms in Spain and Meo and Clix in Portugal. Among the series broadcast across Animax's networks in Spain and Portugal were \"Nana\", \"Black Lagoon\", \"Love Hina\", \"\", \"Chobits\", \"\". As of 2011, the Portuguese feed was removed due to low ratings and was replaced by AXN Black, an offshoot of AXN. In 2013, the Spanish feed rebranded and eliminated all of its western programming in favor for anime, although the programming consisted on continuous reruns of four anime, later reduced to two. On December 31, 2013, the Spanish feed was also removed due to its low ratings.\n\nAnimax in Italy began as a nighttime 1-hour programming block on sister channel AXN Italy on January 12, 2008, indicating that it will eventually launch as a 24/7 channel. The programs that aired on the block were \"Planetes\", \"The Vision of Escaflowne\", \".hack//SIGN\", and \"Noein\". The block hasn't aired since 2009, likely to avoid competition with MTV, who also aired anime and was more widely available.\n\nOn May 14, 2007, Sony announced Animax would be launching in Germany from early June 2007, becoming the country's first ever television network solely dedicated to anime programming. Animax launched in the country from June 5, 2007 on Unity Media's digital subscription television service in the regions of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse and other regions. Among the first anime series premiering on Animax Germany were \".hack//Sign\", \"Dragon Ball\", \"Earth Girl Arjuna\", \"Eureka Seven\", \"Gundam SEED\", \"Oh My Goddess!\", \"One Piece\", \"Record of Lodoss War\", \"School Rumble\", \"The Candidate for Goddess\", \"X\" and numerous others. The channel later launched into Austria and Switzerland.\n\nThe TV channel closed on July 7, 2016, Animax continues as VOD in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nStart of network in Poland was in plans, following on other similar expansions around Central Europe. But currently, plans have stopped and there are no longer plans to do due to financial reasons. It was, however, available as a daily block on AXN Spin HD (which is an offshoot of AXN Poland) airing on late mornings, the afternoon, and sometimes late at night. Programs airing on the block included \"Dragon Ball GT\", \"Naruto\", \"Vampire Knight\", \"Kilari\", \"Deltora Quest\", \"D.gray-man\", \"\", the \"Slayers\" series, and \"Soul Eater\".\n\nAnimax launched as a two-hour programming block on the Sci Fi Channel Australia (which is co-owned by Animax's parent Sony Pictures Entertainment) from November 5, 2008, playing on Wednesday nights and Saturday mornings. It launched with the series \"\", \"Cowboy Bebop\", \"Black Lagoon\" and \"Blood+\". This is Animax's latest English language network, following their networks in Southeast Asia, South Asia and South Africa. Previously, Animax had also been similarly launched as a three-hour programming block in Spain and Portugal on AXN (also similarly owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment), beginning from 2007 and then subsequently fully launching as a separate 24-hour anime network on April 12, 2008. As of 2016, the block is no longer on air.\n\nAnimax programming has also been available since June 12, 2007 through its mobile television service, Animax Mobile, available on 3 mobile's 3G network. Its initial programming on launch consisted of four full-length anime series, \"Blood+\", \"R.O.D the TV\", \"\" and \"Last Exile\". As of 2016 Animax Mobile doesn't exist anymore in Australia.\n\nIn August 2007, it was announced that Animax would be launching across several countries in Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique and Lesotho, on the DStv satellite service and in Nigeria on HiTV, from March 19, 2009. On 31 October 2010, Animax was removed from DSTV, due to a lack of viewers brought on by channel drift (as reality shows occupied the majority of the schedule, similar to Animax Latin America and Animax Spain), to be replaced with a more general Sony channel in February 2011, as Sony MAX.\n\nThe network began broadcasting on DStv on November 3, 2007, until it was terminated on October 31, 2010, and featured English language programming. It had been lauded by publications such as \"The Times\" for having singularly spread awareness about anime than any other platform, and celebrated its first year of broadcasts in South Africa in November 2008. Sony Pictures Television International manager Philipp Schmidt was quoted by \"The Times\" as saying that Animax's primary goal was to \"establish itself as the destination for anime programming\" in South Africa, and also that the feedback that it has received has shown it has been making an impact in the country. Animax South Africa premiered programs such as \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", \"Tenjo Tenge\", \"\", \"Record of Lodoss War\", \".hack//SIGN\", \"Negima! Magister Negi Magi\", \"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED\", \"Eureka Seven\", \"Angelic Layer\", \"SoltyRei\", \"Black Cat\", \"Hinotori\", \"\", \"Chrono Crusade\", \"Last Exile\", \"Samurai 7\", \"Burst Angel\", \"Black Jack\", \"Black Lagoon\", \"Hellsing\", \"Wolf's Rain\", \"Basilisk\", \"Gantz\", \"Paranoia Agent\", \"Witchblade\" and \"Elfen Lied\".\n\nApart from operating its programming as a television network, Animax begun launching its programming across mobile television, first beginning in their original home in Japan and subsequently overseas. In February 2007, Animax announced that it would be launching a mobile television service in Japan on the mobile phone company MOBAHO! from April 2007, having its programming being viewable by the company's mobile phone subscribers. Subsequently, in June 2007, it launched in Australia and Canada, its first English language mobile networks, in Latin America on March 18, 2008, and Southeast Asia on November and December 2008, their third mobile English language network, launching in Malaysia and Singapore through mobile service providers Astro, Maxis and StarHub respectively.\n\nAs of 2016 the Animax Mobile service is discontinued worldwide.\n\nSony Pictures Television International signed a deal with developer Arkadium on January 7, 2009, to provide game arenas for Sony Pictures Television International websites, including Animax, with more than forty games licensed.\n\nAnimax's programming is dedicated to anime, and it has been acknowledged as the largest 24-hour anime-only network in the world. In its original network in Japan, it has exclusively premiered several anime, which have aired first on Animax, including \"\" and its sequel \"\", \"\", \"Aishiteruze Baby\", \"Wangan Midnight\" and the 2010 anime adaptation of Marvel's \"Iron Man\" by Madhouse Studios. In addition, its English language network, Animax Asia, aired the first ever anime simulcast with their simulcast of \"Tears to Tiara\" on the same time as the Japanese premiere and the new \"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\" series, on the same week as the Japanese premiere.

It is found at depths of from with the adults usually found from and the young usually found near the surface. This species grows to a total length of about . While a source of food for pelagic carnivorous fishes, this species is of no interest for human fisheries.\n\nThe common fangtooth has a distinctive appearance and grows to a total length of about . Adults are dark brown to black, the head is very large, bony and finely sculptured but does not bear any spines. The eye is small and the gill rakers have bony bases and are tooth-like. The body is deepest just behind the head, tapering rapidly to the caudal peduncle. The mouth is well-armed with sharp fangs and the skin is granular. The dorsal fin has no spines and 17 to 20 soft rays while the anal fin has no spines and 7 to 9 soft rays. The lateral line takes the form of an open groove, bridged in places by overlapping scales. Many deep sea fish do not have swim bladders, but the common fangtooth does.\n\nJuveniles look very different from adults, so much so that they were at one time believed to be a different species. The juveniles were first described as \"Anoplogaster cornuta\" by the French zoologist Achille Valenciennes in 1833, and it was fifty years later that the adults were described and given the name \"Caulolepis longidens\". Not until 1955 was it appreciated that the two were the same species. The juveniles are a much paler colour and somewhat triangular in cross section. They have several long spines on the head, large eyes and slender, pointed gill rakers, but have small teeth and lack the fangs of the adult fish. The skin is largely unpigmented and clad in unpigmented scales, but there is a black patch on the belly formed by dark-coloured cup-like scales. As the juvenile reaches adulthood, it becomes darker as black scales grow to cover its still-unpigmented skin.\n\nThe common fangtooth has a global distribution being found in tropical and temperate waters in both the eastern and western Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Off the western seaboard of America its range extends from British Columbia southwards to south of the equator. It is a pelagic fish occurring between , with adults between ; adults occur in deep water and are often caught in trawls at about . Juveniles are found at lesser depths.\n\nThe common fangtooth is a predator and feeds on other fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. They are themselves preyed on by such fish as tuna, marlin and albacore. It is a schooling fish and is often found in small groups, though it may be solitary. Off the west coast of North America, the common fangtooth seems to breed in the summer months. The fish are oviparous and the developing larvae are planktonic. From examination of the otoliths (bony structures behind the eyes), it appears that this fish lives for at least three years.\n"}

These arms, of unknown meaning or origin, were used until 1781.

These arms were, at the request of the nobility, replaced by the old 1781 arms again on May 21, 1887.\nThe arms with the staff and cornucopia remained in use until 1918.

It is divided administratively into two woredas, the city proper and the non-urban woreda of Gurgura. \nDire Dawa lies in the eastern part of the nation, on the Dechatu River, at the foot of a ring of cliffs that has been described as \"somewhat like a cluster of tea-leaves in the bottom of a slop-basin.\" The western outskirts of the city lie on the Gorro River, a tributary of the Dechatu River. At a latitude and longitude of , Dire Dawa is the second largest city in Ethiopia.\n\nThe city is an industrial centre, home to several markets and the Aba Tenna Dejazmach Yilma International Airport.The city was first founded and settled by the Gurgure clan of Dir and now is home of many different people from all over Ethiopia.\n\nThe region of Dire Dawa was already populated by human beings in Mesolithic times, as revealed by rock paintings and Middle-Stone-Age artifacts in the cave of Porc-Épic, only a few kilometers from Dire Dawa. \nHistorically, the city of Dire Dawa was originally called Dir Dhabe and used to be part of Adal Sultanate during the medieval times and was exclusively settled by the Gurgure Dir clan which is a major Somali tribe and after the weakening of Adal Sultanate, the Oromos took advantage and were able to penetrate through the city and settle into these areas and also assimilate some of the local Gurgura clan.\n\nThe present-day town of Dire Dawa ((311 km by rail from Djibouti), however, is of very recent origin. It owes its foundation to a technical problem: when it became impossible to lay the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway via Harar because of the steep access to the town, \"atse\" Menelik II accepted (in a later dated 5 November 1896) that the first part of the line might finish at a village at the foot of the mountains, which should be named Addis Harar (\"New Harrar\"). The railway reached this location on 24 December 1902, a date which may be considered the day of Dire Dawa's foundation. The new name, however, did not win recognition. In the long run, the local name Dire Dawa was generally accepted. Dire Dawa most probably derives from Somali \"Dir dabo\" (limit of the Dir confederation of the Somali) and popularly etymologizes in its Amharic form as \"hill of uncultivated land\".\n\nFor financial and diplomatic reasons the railway was not continued until 1909 and the final inauguration of the whole line from Djibouti to Addis Ababa-again delayed by the revolution of 1916-only took place on 7 Jun 1917. During all this time, Dire Dawa was practically the town profited much and became a \"boom city\", attracting most of the trade which formerly passed through Harar. By 1902 the Ethiopian government, anticipating the future economic importance of Dire Dawa, had already transferred the customs station for trade with the Red Sea from Gildessa to Dire Dawa.\n\nDire Dawa developed into two settlements separated by the Dekato River, which was dry for most of the year and became a torrent only when it rained. The north-western part of the town was planned and constructed very regularly, mostly by the engineers of the railway company. At first, this part of the town mostly housed the employees of the railway company, but it later attracted, besides the French, also Greeks, Armenians, other Europeans and Arabs, who opened shops and hotels and founded some industry as well. In 1909 the French Capuchin Mission settled in Dire Dawa. At that time Dire Dawa looked like a French town. The other part of the town, southeast of the river, concentrated around the market and was inhabited mainly by Ethiopian, Somali and a few Arab traders.\n\nIn September 1916 the fleeing troops of \"lij\" Iyasu took hold of the town. Though \"lij\" Iyasu's governor there, the Syrian Hasib al-Idlibi, assured their security, 400 Europeans left the town and the rail traffic had to be suspended. After the battle of Maeso, the governmental troops from Addis Ababa re-established a regular administration.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the south-eastern part of the town also started to develop. Its inhabitants were mostly Somali and Oromo, the other Ethiopians playing only a minor role. The population here grew to 3,000, while that of the whole town numbered 20,000. Between the two World Wars, two hospitals were established in Dire Dawa, one by the railway company and another in 1934 by the government. Education on a primary level was provided by a government school, a Catholic mission school and several schools for the different foreign communities in the town (Greek, Italian, Indian).\nDire Dawa's first governor was Ato Mersha Nahusenay. Formerly the governor of the strategic village of Gildessa and its environs, Mersha was instrumental in the construction of the first railway and establishment of the railway city. The imperial railway company (Cie) played a key role in the early development of the city, particularly Gezira (aka Kezira), under the authority of the Ethiopian government. The original failed company was reörganized as the joint-government Franco-Ethiopian Railway in 1908 and, after a period of financial negotiation and recapitalization, construction began anew, linking the city with the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa in 1917. The Dire Dawa-Harar road was improved in 1928, shortening the travel time to only a few hours. In 1931, the Bank of Ethiopia opened its first branch in the city and, a generation later, the writer C.F. Rey described the city as the most \"advanced\" urban center in the area, with good roads, electric lights, and piped water.\n\nOn 9 May 1936 Dire Dawa was occupied by Italian troops coming from Harar, after Somali troops from Djibouti had prevented looting during the period of interregnum. Badoglio and Graziani celebrated their meeting on the railway station of Dire Dawa. The Italians constructed several new buildings in Dire Dawa, especially for the administration and the Fascist party. They also improved the roads and enlarged the airport so that their military planes could take off from there to bomb the patriot forces in the Gara Mulleta. As for other towns, the Italians conceived a \"piano regolatore\" for the construction of an Italian town in Dire Dawa. However, their occupation ended before they could complete these plans.\n\nDuring the Italian invasion, Mussolini ordered that Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa be spared air attacks (which included the use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas) and other destruction as a response to the demands of the United States and certain European countries for the safety of their citizens. The Italian army entered the country from the colonies of Eritrea in the north and Somalia in the southeast. Following all major engagements of the war, Dire Dawa was the location of the meeting of the two Italian forces. General Graziani's units, advancing from Harar, reached the city's barbed-wire fence on 6 May 1936, the day after the occupation of Addis Ababa and Emperor Haile Selassie's flight along the railroad to Djibouti and Palestine. They were met by two French armed cars: the railway remained under French administration and they had remained to protect the French interests. The next day, the first train under Italian control left Addis Ababa: it brought Italy's 46th Infantry Regiment and finally closed the pincers of the two Italian invasion forces. The occupation of the town was more or less a formality, although resistance fighters known as \"Arbegnoch\" (\"Patriots\") continued to operate throughout the conflict. It was officially known by its Italian spelling \"Dire Daua\" during the occupation.\n\nIn June 1940 the British started to bomb the town and on 29 March 1941 Dire Dawa was liberated by the Allied forces from Harar. The town remained under British Military Administration, being the headquarters for the British Reserved Areas (Ogaden), till it was handed over to the Ethiopian government in 1947. In the following decades the town greatly expanded and the population grew to 160,000. The infrastructure was ameliorated and several industrial plants were established.\n\nFollowing the restoration of the empire in 1941, Dire Dawa was among the early provincial towns to have its own soccer league. Around 1947, their teamthe Taffariparticipated in the Ethiopian Championship series. That same year, the Railroad Workers Syndicate of Dire Dawa, a labor union, was formed for welfare purposes. Although its leadership coöperated with the government, its attempt to strike in 1949 was brutally suppressed by imperial troops; at the time, all strikes were seen as forms of insurrection or treason. In 1955, a public address system was installed in the central square to receive and rebroadcast state radio transmissions.\n\nThe Ethiopian revolution affected the city in many ways. Starting March 1974, there was some worker unrest; six people were wounded when police opened fire on demonstrating railwaymen and students on 17 April. Many Europeans, Yemeni Arabs, and Indians left Dire Dawa; the Greek and Armenian churches were eventually closed due to dwindling membership. On 3 February 1975, the Derg announced that the Cotton Company of Ethiopia was among 14 textile enterprises to be fully nationalized. The cement factory was also later nationalized. In August 1976, the entire leadership of the local branch of the teachers' union was sacked for alleged anti-revolutionary activities. Ten new officials were appointed pending fresh elections.\n\nDire Dawa again played a role in the Ethio-Somali War of 1977/78. It was besieged by the Somali troops till November 1977, when the Ethiopians, Cubans and Russians under General Vasiliy Petrov took the offensive and pushed the Somalis back. In May 1979, 250 Oromos who were detained in the prisons of Dire Dawa were executed by the Derg regime. According to Gebru Tareke, the success of the Ethiopian Army in holding Dire Dawa (17–18 August 1977) against the Somali Army was decisive in winning the Ogaden War. The war led to widespread dislocation of Ethiopia's native Somali population and subsequent repopulation from other areas of the country greatly decreased their importance around Dire Dawa.\n\nDire Dawa was occupied by the EPRDF on 31 May 1991. There were reports of about 100 people killed resisting the EPRDF. In 1991, when the Somali National Movement took control of northern Somalia, they dismantled and sold the only publicly owned industry in the whole Somali northern region, a cement factory near Berbera, which was shipped off to help expand the cement factory in Dire Dawa. Both the Issa and Gurgura Liberation Front and the Oromo Liberation Front claimed the city. As a result, there were numerous clashes between the two groups from 1991 until 1993. When the Somali Regional State was being established in 1993, it wanted Dire Dawa to be its capital. This was opposed by the Oromia Region, so the federal government placed the city under its own jurisdiction to avoid territorial conflict between the two regions.\n\nOn 24 June 2002, a small explosive was detonated at the headquarters of the Ethiopian Railway Commission in Dire Dawa. The Oromo Liberation Front afterwards claimed responsibility for this attack in retaliation \"for the continuing harassment of Oromo students, merchants, and farmers by the Ethiopian government.\" Although blamed for other isolated incidents, this was the latest bombing inside Ethiopia for which the OLF claimed responsibility.\n\nDire Dawa moved out of federal administration to become a chartered city in 2004 after the federal parliament approved the city charter in proclamation 416/2004.\n\nThe city was flooded in August 2006 when both the \"Dechatu River\" and the \"Gorro River\" overflowed their banks. About 200 people were reported dead, thousands were displaced and there was extensive damage to homes and markets especially along the Dechatu River. Floods are fairly common during the June–September rainy season; over 200 people in the region had been killed by flooding in 2005 that did millions of dollars in damage.\n\nAn overturned truck, heading from Dengego to Dire Dawa, killed 41 people 4 March 2009. The truck was carrying an unknown number of day laborers when the accident happened, and 38 were immediately killed and as many as 50 were injured. Dead and injured were taken to Dil-chora Hospital in Dire Dawa. The cause was not immediately known.\n\nCurrently, there are plans to revitalize the city. A historic and popular part of the city is to be demolished and replaced by a financial center, malls, mixed-use buildings, hotels, recreational facilities, and hospitals. As part of the plan, historical buildings will be renovated, and a new space will be allotted for building new homes and businesses for those displaced by the move. New roads, parks, and an industrial zone will also be built, and major railway project is expected to greatly increase business activity in the city.\n\nDire Dawa has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification \"BSh\"). The mean annual temperature of Dire Dawa is about . The average maximum temperature of Dire Dawa is , while its average minimum temperature is about . The region has two rain seasons; that is, a small rain season from March to April, and a more pronounced rain season that extends from July to August. The aggregate average annual rainfall that the region gets from these two seasons is about .\n\nCensuses record that Oromo are the greatest percentage of the city, based on the number who claim Oromo identity and speak the Oromo language. Traditionally the Nole Oromo clan used the area as grazing land, and farming in the Laga Harre district. They live alongside the Gurgura clan which share both Oromo and Somali identities, speaking the Oromo language and tracing their genealogy to the Dir, a Somali clan family. The Issa subclan of the Dir make up a huge number of urban and rural Dire Dawa, whereas a small fraction of the Gadabuursi subclan of the Dir mainly reside in the rural areas to the east of the chartered city state \n\nBased on the 2007 Census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), Dire Dawa has a population of 341,834, of whom 171,461 are men and 170,461 women; 233,224 or 68.23% of the population are urban inhabitants. For all of Dire Dawa 76,815 households were counted living in 72,937 housing units, which results in an average of 4.5 persons to a household, with urban households having on average 4.2 and rural households 4.9 people. Ethnic groups in the region include the Oromo (45%), Somali (35%), Amhara (13%), Gurage (3%), and Harari (1%). The religion with the most believers in Dire Dawa is Muslim with 70.8%, 25.71% are Ethiopian Orthodox, 2.81% Protestant, and 0.43% Catholic.\nAccording to the CSA, , 90.76% of the population had safe drinking water: 69.61% of rural and 99.48% of urban inhabitants having access. Values for other reported common indicators of the standard of living for Dire Dawa include the following: 11.4% of the inhabitants fall into the lowest wealth quintile; adult literacy for men is 76.6% and for women 53%; and the civic infant mortality rate is 71 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, which is less than the nationwide average of 77; at least half of these deaths occurred in the infants’ first month of life.\n\nDire Dawa received postal service in August 1906, becoming the third location after Addis Ababa and Harar. Telephone service was available by 1954; by 1967, Dire Dawa had almost 500 telephone numbers, more than almost all other towns including Gondar, Harar, and Jimma.\n\nThe CSA estimated in 2005 that farmers in Dire Dawa had a total 40,400 head of cattle (representing 0.1% of Ethiopia's total), 46,280 sheep (0.27%), 118,770 goats (0.92%), 8,820 asses (0.35%), 5,070 camels (1.11%), 44,740 poultry of all species (0.14%), and 840 beehives (less than 0.1%).\n\nThe invasive weed \"Parthenium hysterophorus\" (or Congress weed) was first observed in Ethiopia near Dire Dawa in 1980. Experts speculate that it entered the country either through the Djibouti - Addis Ababa railway line or the international airport, carried by one of the food aid programs.\n\nAbout 2007, a concrete sleeper factory was established, sited near the cement factory.\n\nDire Dawa is home to several market centers, the biggest being Taiwan along with Qefira which is on the flood plain. Near Dire Dawa and what is now Kebele 01, trading happened in the town called Melka Jebdu. It has been the gateway for most of the goods sold in places such as Taiwan.\n\nDire Dawa is served by a station on the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway, which is located 10 km northwest of the city centre close to the town of Melka Jebdu. In addition, the city is served by the Ethio-Djibouti Railways with its western terminus located in the city centre. The Dire Dawa Airport offers flights to and from the city. Additionally, the Selam Bus Line Share Company provides inter-city bus service.\n\nDire Dawa was the inspiration for the fictional town \"Debra Dowa\", capital of the fictional East African nation \"Azania\" in the \"outrageously un-politically correct tale\" \"Black Mischief\" by the English author, Evelyn Waugh.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3720214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3720214", "title": "European Union withholding tax", "text": "European Union withholding tax\n\nThe European Union withholding tax is the common name for a withholding tax which is deducted from interest earned by European Union residents on their investments made in another member state, by the state in which the investment is held. The European Union itself has no taxation powers, so the name is strictly a misnomer. The aim of the tax is to ensure that citizens of one member state do not evade taxation by depositing funds outside the jurisdiction of residence and so distort the single market. The tax is withheld at source and passed on to the EU Country of residence. All but three member states disclose the recipient of the interest concerned. Most EU states already apply a withholding tax to savings and investment income earned by their nationals on deposits and investments in their own states. The Directive seeks to bring inter-state income into the same arrangement, under the Single Market policy.\n\nThe tax was introduced at the time of the introduction of the European Union Savings Directive (EUSD), a directive on the taxation of interest income from savings within the European Union that came into effect on 1 July 2005.\n\nThe original aim of the EUSD was that all countries would freely disclose interest earned by a resident of an EU country in order to ensure that the interest was fully declared in his country of residence. The plan was that non-EU countries would also agree to disclose information about the interest earned by EU residents. Many non-EU states and countries agreed to introduce similar measures. These countries included most tax havens and dependent territories of the EU countries. Countries such as the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, Cayman Islands, Andorra, Turks & Caicos, British Virgin Islands, Monaco, Switzerland, and many others thus agreed to implement similar or transitional arrangements (see below). The transitional arrangements involved the payment of a withholding tax whilst bank secrecy remained protected.\n\nSome countries agreed to fully comply with the EU Savings Directive by disclosing the names of their account holders and the interest that they earned. However, several other EU and non-EU countries, such as Switzerland, objected to the disclosure of account holders' names on the grounds that such a disclosure would be contrary to their bank secrecy laws. Bank secrecy laws prevent the disclosure of information about account holders, their assets, and their interest or other income.\n\nFinally an agreement was struck with the objecting countries. The objecting countries achieved agreement from the EC that no further attempt would be made to commence negotiations regarding bank secrecy rules for at least 7 years, in return for which individual account holders could, if they so wished, voluntarily elect to waive bank secrecy and authorise disclosure. Those individuals who did not make any election would see a withholding tax deducted from their bank and bond interest. To avoid the withholding tax, certain types of individuals could also prove that they were exempt from taxation in their country of residence. Exempt individuals include certain diplomats and others with a special tax status in their country of residence.\n\nAccordingly, in order to guarantee privacy and bank secrecy for EU residents who have accounts within certain territories such as Switzerland, a withholding tax of 35% is being levied on the interest earned by those EU residents. This withholding tax, which applies only to certain interest income NOT considered as sourced in Switzerland, such as interest earned on fiduciary reposits, is passed on \"anonymously\" to the EU countries concerned, and is known informally as the EU Withholding Tax.\n\nIn the example below we use Greece as an example, but the same mechanism applies to any Member State.\n\nIf a Greek individual receives e.g. EUR 500 of interest income from a fiduciary deposit in a Swiss bank, the individual would have 2 possibilities:\n\n(1) to accept the levying of the 35% \"retention\" tax under the EU-CH agreement (as discussed above), or\n\n(2) to expressly authorise the Swiss bank to report that he has received the interest payments to the Swiss authorities that are then obliged to pass on automatically the information to the Greek competent authority (Art. 2 of the EU-CH agreement).\n\nIf the beneficial owner decides to be subject to the 35% \"retention\" tax under the EU-CH agreement, upon filing the Greek tax return, that tax is fully creditable, with possible subsequent reimbursement by Greece under Article 9(1) of the EU-CH agreement: \"Where this amount exceeds the amount of tax due on the total amount of interest subject to retention in accordance with its national law, the Member State of residence for tax purposes shall repay the excess amount of tax withheld to the beneficial owner.\". In the example, the \"retention\" tax under the EU-CH agreement is 500*0.35=175. 75% of that EUR 175 (175*0.75=131.25) would be transferred \"anonymously\" to Greece. Upon filing his tax return, the Greek beneficial owner is entitled to full credit, not only for the amount paid to Greece (EUR 131.25), but for the total \"retention\" tax levied under the EU-CH agreement (EUR 175). Therefore, if the Greek tax liability would be 500*0.10=50 and the credit would be EUR 175, the credit would cover 100% of the Greek tax liability and would exceed it by 50-175=-125. That excess credit (EUR 125) must be refunded to the beneficial owner by Greece.\n\nIf the beneficial owner chooses option (2) and authorises the Swiss bank to report the information, he will be only taxed in Greece according to the Greek domestic rate of 10% and the Greek competent authority will have the possibility to check that he has correctly declared the interest payments received from the Swiss bank.\n\nIn the example below we use Greece as an example, but the same mechanism applies to any Member State.\n\nIf a Greek beneficial owner has an ordinary bank account (i.e. not a fiduciary deposit) that produced interest income of e.g. EUR 500, he will be subject to 35% anticipatory tax in Switzerland under its domestic law (i.e. NOT under the EU-CH Agreement), i.e. 500*0.35=175.\n\nThen, if the beneficial owner would like to use the reduced rate under GR-CH double tax treaty (10%), he would have to file a refund claim to the Swiss tax authorities. That claim would have to be accompanied by a certificate of tax residence issued by the Greek tax authorities. When requesting this certificate, the beneficial owner is effectively signalling to the Greek tax authorities the fact that he has earned or will earn income from a foreign source. Once he has filed the refund claim to the Swiss authorities, the Greek beneficial owner will be entitled to a refund for the difference between the anticipatory tax (500*0.35=175) and the maximum tax under the double tax treaty (500*0.10=50), which is 175-50=125. So, the actual tax burden in Switzerland after the application of the refund procedure is EUR 50. Now if the Greek domestic tax on the inbound interest income is 10%, it would in principle be levied on a gross basis, i.e. the tax base would be the full amount of interest income received (EUR 500). The Greek tax liability would be 500*0.10=50. However, under Art. 22 of the GR-CH Double tax treaty \"Where a resident of Greece derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention may be taxed in Switzerland, Greece shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in Switzerland. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the Greek tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Switzerland.\" The Greek beneficial owner would therefore be entitled to credit the EUR 50 levied in Switzerland against his tax liability in Greece, which is also EUR 50. Therefore, after the application of the credit, the Greek beneficial owner would not owe any Greek tax on that interest income.\n\nThe EU withholding tax currently applies to the residents of the 28 European Union Member States as shown below:\n\nTogether with their dates of accession, the 28 current members of the European Union are:\nThe EU withholding tax applies only to bank interest, bond interest, and analogous income, such as income from bond funds, money market funds, loans, and mortgages.\n\nCertain anti-avoidance measures exist, for example, to levy the tax where interest has been converted to some form of capital gain. Typically this would apply where, for example, a zero coupon bond has been bought and sold at a profit, or where a bond fund, or a money-market fund, does not pay out its interest and the fund is subsequently sold at a profit. The rules define how much of the fund's assets must be in bonds for it to be classified as \"interest earning\".\n\nInitial reports as to the amounts of funds raised by the withholding tax suggest that the anti-avoidance measures have not been particularly effective.\n\nThe EU withholding tax is not levied on any other forms of income such as employment income, trading profits, commercial activities, royalties, annuities and similar income. Also, the EU withholding tax does not apply to dividends from shares, nor to capital gains and other profits realised on investments. All these types of income and profits are described as being \"out of scope\".\n\nThe EU withholding tax is levied only on individuals and not on companies, discretionary trusts, foundations, stiftungs, anstalts, investment funds, etc., except in very special circumstances, e.g. a \"bare trust\".\n\nThe EU withholding tax is not deducted from individuals who reside outside the European Union. Thus, for example, a resident of Jersey or of Switzerland, would not pay the tax, even though these countries have signed the agreement with the EU. Neither Jersey nor Switzerland are in the European Union.\n\nThe EU withholding tax does not apply to interest paid to companies. A separate EU directive, the Interest and Royalties Directive, applies to interest (or royalties) paid by a company in one member state to an associated company in another member state. Such interest is exempt from withholding tax, although in many cases interest paid is in any event exempt from withholding tax under the terms of double tax treaties between member states.\n\nIn the UK such individuals have a special tax status which limits them to paying tax on income and gains from UK sources, and on foreign income and gains which are remitted to the UK. A similar status can be accorded to individuals in some other European countries (e.g. Belgium and the Netherlands), because they are only temporarily resident for the purpose of employment. Certain countries such as Jersey and Switzerland accept that these individuals may be exempt from tax on income earned and retained overseas, and are thus not subject to any retention. The exemption needs to be proven.\n\nSpain has introduced a similar concept to the UK non-domiciled rule above, known as the Beckham law. The law gained its nickname after the footballer David Beckham became one of the first foreigners to take advantage of it. However the law is aimed at all foreign workers (particularly the wealthier ones) living in Spain. Upon application and acceptance such individuals are only liable for Spanish taxes on their Spanish source income and assets. As with the UK non-domiciled individuals, exemption from tax on foreign income must be proven to the financial institution to avoid the EU Savings Tax deduction.\n\nThe Countries that would be applying the transitory provisions, instead of exchanging information will retain withholding tax as follows:\n\nWith regard to the distribution of their withholding tax, the Directive provides that all Countries that are withholding it will retain 25% of all receipts at their end and will transfer the remaining 75% to the Member State where the beneficiary owner is resident.\n\nWith regard to double taxation, the Directive provides that the Member State where the beneficiary owner is resident, and therefore where he normally pays his tax dues, should ensure that tax is not paid more than once when applying the withholding tax rates.\n\n, all EU member states exchange information with each other, per EU Council directive 2014/107/EU.\n\nPrior to 2017, there were several exceptions for member countries. The most recent exception was Austria. Belgium decided to discontinue applying the transitional withholding tax in 2010 and exchange information afterwards. In Luxembourg, clients could choose between exchange of information and withholding tax retention until 2015.\n\nGibraltar is deemed to be part of the UK for the purposes of the EU Savings Directive and thus will exchange information with other EU countries such as Spain and the UK. Residents of Gibraltar will either suffer withholding tax on interest arising overseas, or have that income reported to the UK who will pass it on to Gibraltar authorities.\n\nAmong the third countries signatories there are also, Anguilla, Cayman Islands, Montserrat and Aruba who have agreed to exchanging information.\n\nCountries that are not EU member states that also maintain bank secrecy:\n\n\nSingapore, Hong Kong, Bermuda and Barbados did not sign any agreement.\n\nBermuda, a UK dependent territory was missed out by EU by accident.\n\n\n"}

The mentioned project was established under aegis of Charles University Prague and aims to educate extraordinary gifted children in natural sciences. The theory is that talented children need individual treatment to identify themselves and develop their gifts. A program that would deal these goals was needed. That's why the program Talnet creates a space in the online platform, where its students could meet, discuss the topics they've found interesting ones. In addition, such possibility is there not only with the other Talnet students - with the experts as well. TalnetSpace – online platform of Talnet communication – lets connect students and pupils according to their goals and interests.\n\nTalnet develops also network among partners abroad and seeks the other groups in the world which aims are similar to the Talnet's one - the education of extraordinary gifted students. The main effort is given to the students' meeting across boardings. Thus the meeting has two stages: at first students explore online activities and learn the communication, secondly they meet each other at interesting places of the connected countries.\n\nTalnet aims also pupils', parents and teachers' education. This way, Talnet helps them to find out the gift among all the pupils in the class and support them sufficiently. The organisation uses international knowledge and continues in well-known contests and activities special prepared for students with natural science interests. Talnet cooperates with a group of psychologists, who at the beginning and during the pupils' online study watch the gifted young persons in their developing and consulate their personal problems with them.\n\n \"Talnet offers the whole structure of educational and exploring activities to children who are recommended by their teachers or psychologists. Activities differ in topic, forms (face to face, blended, online) teaching approach, work load, complexity and applicability. We prefer active participation of children and youth in rich learning environment according to the results of psycho-diagnostics tests.\n\nSince the beginning of the project we have confirmed that many gifted children need more and more challenging, e.g. demanding and complex, activities. The level of challenge may be perceived in many different aspects such as subject, problem solving, creativity, production and social aspects etc. The main purpose of international activities is offering gifted youth further opportunities for development of their competencies and extending the offer of authentic educational and social activities.\" \n\nSpecific references:\nofficial Talnet websites\n"}

It is a person who already owes money to the tax authorities or wishes to avoid being liable in the future to taxation at what they consider high tax rates, instead choosing to reside in a foreign country or jurisdiction which has no taxes or lower tax rates. In general, there is no extradition agreement between countries which covers extradition for outstanding tax liabilities. Going into tax exile is a form of tax mitigation or avoidance. A tax exile normally cannot return to their home country without being subject to outstanding tax liabilities, which may prevent them from leaving the country until they have been paid.\n\nMost countries tax individuals who are resident in their jurisdiction. Though residency rules vary, most commonly individuals are resident in a country for taxation purposes if they spend at least six months (or some other period) in any one tax year in the country, and/or have an abiding attachment to the country, such as owning a fixed property.\n\nA very simplified 'rule of thumb' is that under UK law a person is \"tax resident\" if that person meets any of the residency tests set out under the Statutory Residency Test introduced on 6 April 2014. The reality of the matter is far more complex and unclear.\n\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code, a United States citizen is taxed on his or her worldwide income, regardless to their place of residence. United States citizens can avoid tax liability only by both moving abroad and renouncing citizenship, but if they continue to earn money inside the United States, they will still be liable for taxes as if they were guest workers. However, United States citizens living abroad are entitled to substantial tax savings through the foreign earned income exclusion.\n\nA permanent resident in the United States is generally treated as a citizen for tax purposes unless his or her residency lapses. An immigrant not legally admitted for permanent residence (such as a guest worker) becomes liable for United States taxes if they spend more than 122 days in the tax year in the United States.\n\n\n\n"}

His shrine is at Merv (Turkmenistan).\n\nBorn in Buzanjird near Hamadan in 1062, he moved from Hamadan to Baghdad when he was eighteen years of age. He studied the Shafi'i school of fiqh under the supervision of the master of his time, Shaykh Ibrahim ibn Ali ibn Yusuf al-Fairuzabadi. He kept association in Baghdad with the great scholar, Abu Ishaq ash-Shirazi, who gave him greater deference than to any of his other students although he was the youngest. But he adhered to the Hanafi school unlike his teachers.\n\nAccording to Ibn Khallikan, he began his religious career with the cultivation of the religious sciences, becoming both a respected scholar of hadith and fiqh and a popular preacher in Baghdad. He was so brilliant a jurisprudent that he became the Marja of his time for all scholars in that field. He was known in Baghdad, the center of Islamic knowledge, in Isfahan, Bukhara, Samarqand, Khwarazm, and throughout Central Asia.\n\nLater he abandoned these pursuits, adopting an intensely ascetic way of life and travelled east, first settling in Herat and later in Merv, where his tomb is still reputed to exist. He became an ascetic and engaged in constant worship and mujahada (spiritual struggle), instructed by Shaykh Abu 'Ali al-Farmadhi. He associated with Shaykh Abdullah Ghuwayni and Shaykh Hasan Simnani. He named four khalifas or successors, a pattern that repeated itself for several succeeding generations of the Khwajagan, including Ahmed Yesevi and Khwaja Abdul Khaliq Gajadwani, the next link in the Naqshbandi silsila.\n\nThe Naqshbandi Order, Hamid Algar\nWafayat al-A'yan, Ibn Khallikan\n\n\n"}
