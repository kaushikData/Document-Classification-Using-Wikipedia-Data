{"id": "2767951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2767951", "title": "African nationalism", "text": "African nationalism\n\nAfrican nationalism is an umbrella term which refers to a group of political ideologies, mainly within Sub-Saharan Africa, which are based on the idea of national self-determination and the creation of nation states. The ideology emerged under European colonial rule during the 19th and 20th centuries and was loosely inspired by nationalist ideas from Europe. Originally, African nationalism was based on demands for self-determination and played an important role in forcing the process of decolonisation of Africa ( 1957–66). However, the term refers to a broad range of different ideological and political movements and should not be confused with Pan-Africanism which may seek the federation of several or all nation states in Africa.\n\nNationalist ideas in Sub-Saharan Africa emerged during the mid-19th century among the emerging black middle classes in West Africa. Early nationalists hoped to overcome ethnic fragmentation by creating nation-states. In its earliest period, it was inspired by African-American and Afro-Caribbean intellectuals from the Back-to-Africa movement who imported nationalist ideals current in Europe and the Americas at the time. The early African nationalists were elitist and believed in the supremacy of Western culture but sought a greater role for themselves in political decision-making. They rejected African traditional religions and tribalism as \"primitive\" and embraced western ideas of Christianity, modernity, and the nation state. However, one of the challenges faced by nationalists in unifying their nation after European rule were the divisions of tribes and the formation of ethnicism.\n\nAfrican nationalism first emerged as a mass movement in the years after World War II as a result of wartime changes in the nature of colonial rule as well as social change in Africa itself. Nationalist political parties were established in almost all African colonies during the 1950s and their rise was an important reason for the decolonisation of Africa between 1957 and 1966. However, African nationalism was never a single movement and political groups considered to be African nationalists varied by economic orientation and degrees of radicalism and violence. Nationalists leaders struggled to find their own social and national identity following the European influence that controlled the political landscape during the colonial occupation.\n\nAfrican nationalism in the colonial era was often framed purely in opposition to colonial rule and was therefore frequently unclear or contradictory about its other objectives. According to historian Robert I. Rotberg, African nationalism would not have emerged without colonialism. Its relation to Pan-Africanism was also ambiguous with many nationalist leaders professing Pan-African loyalties but still refusing to commit to supranational unions. African nationalists of the period have also been criticised for their continued use of ideas and policies associated with colonial states. In particular, nationalists usually attempted to preserve national frontiers created arbitrarily under colonial rule after independence and create a national sense of national identity among the heterogeneous populations inside them.\n\nAfrican nationalism exists in an uneasy relationship with tribalism and sub-national ethnic nationalism which differ in their conceptions of political allegiance. Many Africans distinguish between their ethnic and national identities. Some nationalists have argued that tribes were a colonial creation.\n\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s, scholars of African nationalist struggles have primarily focused on the Western-educated male elites who led the nationalist movements and assumed power after independence. The history of studies of women's involvement in African nationalist struggle, mobilization, and party politics can be traced along intellectual and political paths that initially followed, later paralleled, but have seldom deviated from or led the course of Africanist historiography. The goal of these women involved in the African nationalism movement was to recover Africa's past and to celebrate the independent emergence of independent Africa. It was necessary to raise awareness of this cause, calling to the new emerging generation of African women, raised in a better, more stable society. Although, the challenges they faced seemed increasingly more significant, they however had it better than past generations, allowing them to raise awareness of the African Nationalist moment. Whereas women's historians interested in effecting changes in the process and production of American or European history had to fight their way onto trains that had been moving through centuries on well-worn gauges, the \"new\" Africanist train had barely left the station in the early '60s. With a few exceptions, scholars have devoted little more than a passing mention of the presence of African women as conscious political actors in African nationalism. Anne McClintock has stressed that \"all nationalisms are gendered.\" Undoubtedly, women played a significant role in arousing national consciousness as well as elevating their own political and social position through African nationalism. It is with this in mind, that both feminism and the research of these women become critical to the re-evaluation of the history of African nationalism. In 1943, a prominent organization called the African National Congress Women's League used its branches throughout the country to build a national campaign.\n\nAs leaders and activists, women participated in African nationalism through national organisations. The decade of the 1950s was a landmark because of the significant number of women who were politically involved in the nationalist struggle. A minority of women were incorporated and affiliated into male-dominated national organisations. Founded by women in 1960, The National Council of Sierra Leone was to become, in 1968, the women's section of the ruling All People's Congress and dedicated primarily to the vigorous support of head of state, President Stevens. Women activists extended and conveyed militant behaviours. Nancy Dolly Steele was the organizing secretary and co-founder of the Congress, and has been noted for her militant political and nationalist activities. \nIn the same way, throughout Africa, the influence of trade union movements, in particular, became the spawning ground for women organisers as such. South African women, for instance, emerged as primary catalysts for protests against the Apartheid regime. These women first participated in resistance movements through women’s branches of the larger male dominated liberation organizations, as through the African National Congress (ANC). Nevertheless, in 1943, the ANC adopted a new constitution which included a new position for women to become full members of the national movement. Women also formed their own national organisations, such as the Federation of South African Women in 1954, which boasted a membership of 230,000 women. Though at the time women viewed themselves primarily as mothers and wives, the act of their joining in political organisations illustrated a kind of feminist consciousness.\n\nWomen were fundamental nationalist leaders in their own right. Under the inspiration of Bibi Titi Mohammed, a former singer in Dar es Salaam who became a Tanganyikan nationalist, Tanzanian women were organised into a Women’s Section of the Tanganyikan African National Union. Mohammed, who was semi-illiterate, was an impressive orator and later combined her nationalist work in the 1950s with her political ambitions. She was one of the most visible Tanganyikan nationalists during the struggle against colonialism and imperialism. She was the only nationalist leader, besides Julius Nyerere, who was recognized across the country at the time of Tanzanian independence. Her legacy as a leader, speaker, organiser and activist is testimony to the pivotal role played by many uneducated women in spreading a national consciousness, a political awareness and securing independence from British rule in Tanzania.\n\nWhilst some female-oriented initiatives may have been conceived and presented to women by male party-leaders, others were clearly created by women themselves. These women used nationalism as a platform to address their own concerns as wives, mothers, industrial workers, peasants, and as women affiliated to the ANC. The 1940s Anti-tax protest in Tanzania involved the women of Peasant Pare, where women employed methods of direct confrontation, provocative language and physical violence. Explicit use of sexual insult was also central to the powerful Anlu protest of the Cameroon in 1958, where women refused to implement agricultural regulations that would have undermined their farming system. In the same way, women used music, dance and informal methods to convey their solidarity for African nationalism. The production of Tanganyikan nationalism in Tanzania can be seen as “woman’s work,” where women evoked, created and performed nationalism through their dances and songs. Equally, women were considered the best sloganeers, as traditional story-tellers and singers using ideas, images and phrases that appealed to the non-elite population. Market women in coastal Nigeria and Guinea also used their networks to convey anti-government information. ‘Ordinary’ women themselves had transformed \"traditional\" methods for networking and expressing disapproval against individuals, into mechanisms for challenging and unsettling the local colonial administration. However, although these women contributed to African nationalist politics, they had limited impact as their strategies were concerned with shaming, retaliation, restitution and compensation, and were not directly about radical transformation. This problem was a reflection of the extent to which most African women had already been marginalized politically, economically and educationally under colonial regimes in Africa.\n\nIn the Gambia, one of the prominent Gambian nationalists and Pan-Africanists during the colonial era was Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof. From the 1950s up to Gambia's independence, Cham Joof (as he is commonly referred to), held a series of campaigns against the British colonial administration. In 1958, he spearheaded the All Party Committee - the purpose of which was for self-governance and to determine the political direction of the Gambia free from European colonialism and neo-colonialism. In 1959, he organised the Bread and Butter demonstration from outside his house in Barthurst now Banjul, and led his followers to Government House to lobby the British colonial administration. Following that demonstration, Cham Joof and his associates Crispin Grey Johnson and M. B. Jones were indicted as \"inciting the public to disobey the laws of the land\" and charged as political prisoners. '\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1528350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1528350", "title": "Cold-weather warfare", "text": "Cold-weather warfare\n\nCold-weather warfare, also known as Arctic warfare or winter warfare, encompasses military operations affected by snow, ice, thawing conditions or cold, both on land and at sea. Cold-weather conditions occur year-round at high elevation or at high latitudes, and elsewhere materialise seasonally during the winter period. Mountain warfare often takes place in cold weather or on terrain that is affected by ice and snow, such as the Alps and the Himalayas. Historically, most such operations have been during winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Some have occurred above the Arctic Circle where snow, ice and cold may occur throughout the year. At times, cold or its aftermath—thaw—has been a decisive factor in the failure of a campaign, as with Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 and the German invasion of Russia during World War II.\n\nNorthern and Eastern Europe were the venues for some well-documented winter campaigns. During World War II several actions took place above the Arctic Circle. Recent cold-weather conflicts have occurred in the Himalayas.\n\nIn 1242, the Teutonic Order lost the Battle on the Ice on Lake Peipus to Novgorod. In 1520, the decisive Battle of Bogesund between Sweden and Denmark occurred on the ice of lake Åsunden.\n\nSweden and Denmark fought several wars during the 16th and 17th centuries. As a great deal of Denmark consists of islands, it was usually safe from invasion, but in January 1658, most of the Danish waters froze. Charles X Gustav of Sweden led his army across the ice of the Belts to besiege Copenhagen. The war ended with the treaty of Roskilde, a treaty very favorable to the Swedish.\n\nDuring the Great Northern War, Swedish king Charles XII set off to invade Moscow, but was eventually defeated at the Battle of Poltava after being weakened by cold weather and scorched earth tactics. Sweden suffered more casualties during the same war as Carl Gustaf Armfeldt with 6,000 men tried to invade Trondheim. Three thousand of them died of exposure in the snow during the Carolean Death March.\n\nDuring the Finnish War, the Russian army unexpectedly crossed the frozen Gulf of Bothnia from Finland to the Åland Islands and, by 19 March 1809, reached the Swedish shore within 70 km from the Swedish capital, Stockholm. This daring maneuvre decided the outcome of the war.\n\nNapoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 resulted in retreat in the face of winter with the majority of the French army succumbing to frostbite and starvation, rather than combat injuries.\n\nThe Finnish Army used ski troops during the Winter War and the Second World War, where the numerically dominant Soviet forces had a hard time fighting mobile, white-clad ski soldiers.\n\nIn Operation Barbarossa in 1941, both Russian and German soldiers had to endure terrible conditions during the Russian winter. The German-Finnish joint offensive against Murmansk (Operation Silver Fox) in 1941 saw heavy fighting in the Arctic environment. Subsequently, the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation conducted by the Red Army against the Wehrmacht in 1944 in northern Finland and Norway drove the Germans out of there. In late 1944, Finland turned against their former cobelligerents, Nazi Germany, under the Soviet Union's pressure and pressured the Germans to withdraw in the ensuing Lapland War. While use of ski infantry was common in the Red Army, Germany formed only one division for movement on skis.\nFrom June 1942 to August 1943, the United States and Canada fought the Japanese in the Aleutian Islands Campaign in the Alaska Territory.\n\nThe Battle of Chosin Reservoir was a stark example of cold affecting military operations in the Korean War. There were many cold injuries and malfunctions of materiel, both vehicles and weapons.\n\nThe Siachen conflict is a military conflict between India and Pakistan over the disputed Siachen Glacier region in Kashmir. The conflict began in 1984 with India's successful Operation \"Meghdoot\" during which it gained control over all of the Siachen Glacier. A cease-fire went into effect in 2003.\n\nThe following actions were fought in the Arctic by land and naval forces between 1941 and 1945 in the following theaters of operations:\n\n\nThe Winter War was a military conflict between the Soviet Union (USSR) and Finland. It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940.\n\nThe Lapland War was fought between Finland and Germany from September 1944 to April 1945 in Finland's northernmost Lapland Province. It included:\n\n\n\n\nIn his 1981 paper, \"Fighting the Russians in Winter: Three Case Studies\", Chew draws on experiences from the Allied-Soviet War in Northern Russia during the Winter of 1918–19, the destruction of the Soviet 44th Motorized Rifle Division, and Nazi–Soviet Warfare during World War II to derive winter warfare factors pertaining to military tactics, materiel and personnel:\n\n\nOperational factors encompass planning for the climate and weather in which military operations are required with snow, ice, mud and cold being the primary considerations. Military tactics, materiel, combat engineering and military medicine all require specialized adaptations to the conditions encountered in cold weather. The Red Army was an early adopter of a protocol for winter warfare.\n\nIn its 2016 \"Mountain Warfare and Cold Weather Operations\" manual, the US Army defines \"cold regions\" as \"where cold temperatures, unique terrain, and snowfall have a significant effect on military operations for one month or more each year.\" It describes regions that are either \"severely cold\" or \"moderately cold\", each comprising about approximately one quarter of the Earth's land mass.\n\nThe manual also delineates the principal mountain ranges of the world, which lie along the broad belts, which encircle the Pacific basin and then lead westward across Eurasia into North Africa. Secondarily, rugged chains of mountains lie along the Atlantic margins of the Americas and Europe.\nTemperature, wind, snow, and thaw are the primary conditions that affect the winter battlescape.\n\nThe US Army groups cold temperatures using categories. The temperature categories are (with quoted summaries):\nThe combined cooling effect of ambient \"temperature and wind\" (wind chill) is an important factor that affects troops.\n\nFor military purposes, the US Army categorizes snow as light, moderate, or heavy. Each classification affects visibility and ground movement due to accumulation and is quoted below:\nSnow and snowdrifts can create advantages on the battlefield by filling in ditches and vehicle tracks and flattening the terrain. It also creates hollows on the downwind side of obstacles, such as trees, buildings, and bushes, which provide observation points or firing positions. Snowdrifts may provide cover for soldiers to approach an objective. Soviet doctrine cited as the threshold snow depth that impairs mobility for troops, cavalry and vehicles, except tanks for which the threshold was .\n\nThawing conditions can impair mobility and put soldiers at risk of trench foot by creating mud on the ground and by the weakening and breakup ice cover on bodies of water. Maintaining roads becomes more difficult during spring thaw run off and requires mud removal by heavy equipment. Slushy and muddy ground causes clothing and equipment to become wet, damp and dirty. Muddy conditions greatly inhibited Napoleon's ability to maneuver in Russia and also the German attempt to take Moscow in World War II.\n\nThe dominant tactical concern in cold conditions is the ability to maneuver in vehicles or on foot. Additionally, during winter, night operations become the norm at higher latitudes with their long periods of darkness. Snow enhances night vision because of high reflectivity and the visibility of combatants against the white background.\n\n\"Mounted movement\" – Over snow-covered terrain vehicles may be employed to establish and maintain trails by establishing a well concealed track with the first vehicle, followed by a vehicle traveling offset from the track of the first, to flatten the trail, and subsequent vehicles widening and flattening the trail. Marked trails avoid obliteration in snowstorms or drifting conditions. In mountainous terrain, tracked vehicles, including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and cavalry fighting vehicles, rarely accompany dismounted infantry in the assault. Instead, they assist forces by occupying positions where they can use their firepower to isolate enemy objectives.\n\n\"Dismounted movement\" – Troops moving in a wedge-like \"column\" formation travel more slowly, with no one breaking the trail in undisturbed snow, than the in-line file formation. Therefore, column formation is reserved for imminent enemy contact. As slope angle increases, the amount of travel time is likely to increase substantially.\n\n\"Water crossings\" – According to the US Army, rivers found in cold regions may be major obstacles. Subarctic rivers usually have many braided channels and swift currents. During spring and early winter, rivers may become impassable due to freezing or thawing ice flows. Once firmly frozen, rivers may offer routes for both mounted and dismounted movement. Some swampy areas do not freeze solidly during the coldest periods of winter to support troop movements. Nonetheless, it is possible to construct \"ice bridges\" to thicken an iced-over waterway, using pumps or some other means of flooding the ice-covered area, when temperatures are below and the pre-existing natural ice is thicker than 10 centimeters (four inches) to support the construction activity. Red Army doctrine suggested the use of frozen lakes and rivers as expeditionary airfields, located close to the front to take advantage of short daylight hours in winter.\n\nSoviet doctrine emphasized the importance of camouflage over positions and the need to remove telltale signs of artillery actions, such as smoke stains or shell casings. It also cited the usefulness of decoy targets. It describes the establishment of breastworks made from snow thick, ice thick or soil and wood thick.\n\nArmies have made use of improvised and official snow camouflage uniforms and equipment since the First World War, such as in the fighting in the Dolomite Mountains between Austria and Italy. Snow camouflage was used far more widely in the Second World War by the Wehrmacht, the Finnish Army, the Red Army and others. Since then, snow variants of disruptively patterned camouflage for uniforms have been introduced, sometimes with digital patterns. For example, the Bundeswehr has a \"Schneetarn\" (snow) variant of its widely used \"Flecktarn\" pattern.\n\nSnow, ice and cold temperatures affect munitions and military vehicles.\n\n\"Munitions\" – Snow, ice, frozen ground, and low temperatures affect mine-laying operations. Burying mines in a frost layer may be difficult, requiring mines to be placed on top of the ground and then camouflaged. Snow or ice may prevent detonation, owing to freezing the firing device or isolating from pressure above. This can be mitigated with plastic laid over the top of the mine.\n\n\"Vehicles\" – Adaptations of military vehicles to winter operations include tire chains for maintaining traction of wheeled vehicles. Diesel engines start less well in cold and may require pre-heating or idling during cold periods. A variety of military vehicles have been developed for over-snow travel, including the Sisu Nasu, BvS 10, and M29 Weasel.\n\nMilitary engineers design and construct transportation and troop-support facilities. Red Army doctrine gave them the responsibility to establish build and maintain routes, including water crossings, build and destroy obstacles that require special equipment, construct and maintain airfields, and to build shelter for personnel. Operations that didn't require special equipment were left to other troops.\n\nIn cold climates frozen ground can make digging difficult. It's often necessary to use local materials, if suitable, for construction. Engineers must provide roadways, landing zones, shelter, water supply and wastewater disposal, and electrical power to encampments. Roadway and landing zones require heavy equipment, which is more fatiguing to operate in the cold and necessary to protect from freezing. Snowstorms require cleanup and spring thaw requires management of thawed soil. Landing zones require stabilization of dust and snow to avoid blinding helicopter pilots. The US Army has cold-weather adaptive kits for providing water and electrical utilities. The tactical engineer has limited options for providing a water supply; they are in order of ease of provision: drawing water from rivers or lakes, melting ice or snow, or drilling wells.\n\nWater supply and treatment is especially challenging in the cold. US Army tactical water purification systems require a winter kit operate between . Water storage may require heating. Water source exploitation may require angering through ice, if shaped charges are not available. The water distribution system can be subject to freezing and clogging from frazil ice. Where chemical treatment is used, it takes longer to dissolve in the treated water.\n\nThree types of cold injury can occur in the theater, hypothermia, trench foot, and frostbite in ascending amount of exposure to cold temperatures.\n\nHypothermia occurs when the body core temperature drops below . Symptoms depend on the temperature and range from shivering and mental confusion to increased risk of the heart stopping. The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing and physical activity. In those with moderate hypothermia heating blankets and warmed intravenous fluids are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe hypothermia extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be useful. In those without a pulse cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures. Rewarming is typically continued until a person's temperature is greater than . Adequate insulation from clothing is the best way to avoid hypothermia in the field.\n\nTrench foot is a medical condition caused by prolonged exposure of the feet to damp, unsanitary, and cold conditions at temperatures as warm as for as few as 13 hours. Exposure to these environmental conditions causes deterioration and destruction of the capillaries and leads to morbidity of the surrounding flesh. Affected feet may become numb, affected by erythema (turning red) or cyanosis (turning blue) as a result of poor blood supply, and may begin emanating a decaying odour if the early stages of necrosis (tissue death) set in. As the condition worsens, feet may also begin to swell. Advanced trench foot often involves blisters and open sores, which lead to fungal infections. If left untreated, trench foot usually results in gangrene, which may require amputation. If trench foot is treated properly, complete recovery is normal, though it is marked by severe short-term pain when feeling returns. Trench foot affected tens of thousands of soldiers engaged in trench warfare in World War I. Keeping feet warm and dry, or at least changing into warm and dry replacement footgear, is the best way to avoid trench foot.\n\nFrostbite is localized damage to skin and other tissues due to freezing. At or below , blood vessels close to the skin start to constrict, and blood is shunted away from the extremities. The same response may also be a result of exposure to high winds. This constriction helps to preserve core body temperature. In extreme cold, or when the body is exposed to cold for long periods, this protective strategy can reduce blood flow in some areas of the body to dangerously low levels. This lack of blood leads to the eventual freezing and death of skin tissue in the affected areas. Frostbite was responsible for over one million casualties in wars in the 20th century. Adequate insulation from clothing is the best way to avoid hypothermia in the field.\n\nThe following nations report regular training programs in cold-weather warfare:\n\n\nSubfreezing conditions have significant implications for naval operations. The 1988 \"US Navy Cold Weather Handbook for Surface Ships\" outlines effects on: icing on the topsides of ships, ship systems, underway replenishment, flight operations, and personnel. It also discusses preparations for cold-weather fleet operations.\n\nTopside icing is a serious hazard to ships operating in sub-freezing temperatures. Thick layers of ice can form on decks, sides, superstructures, deck mounted machinery, antennas and combat systems. The presence of topside ice has many adverse effects, principally it:\n\nIcing may prevent a warship from conducting any type of offensive operations, including restraining the doors of a vertical launch systems, binding gears, shafts, hinges and pedestals. Other effects include sluggish performance of lubricants, increased failure rate of seals, plugs and O-rings, frozen magazine sprinkler systems, excessively long warm-up times for electronics or weapon system electronics, and freeze up of compressed-air-operated components.\n\nGlobal climate change has opened the waters of the Arctic along the northern shores of Alaska, Russia and Canada. The region is rich in natural resources. Countries abutting the Arctic Ocean have shown greater military patrol activity. The \"Military Times\" reported in 2015 that Russia had reactivated ten military bases, had increased surface ship and aircraft patrols of its Northern Fleet, and had conducted missile tests in the region. The US Navy plans to have sufficient assets by 2030 to respond militarily in the Arctic. As of 2015, it conducted regular submarine patrols, but few air or surface ship operations. Russia had twelve ice breakers versus two for the US. As of 2013, Canada had six ice breakers. In 2016, Canada announced the building of five ice-breaking Arctic and offshore patrol ships.\n\n\n\n"}

The United Nations conference to adopt the compact will be held in Marrakesh, Morocco, on 10–11 December 2018. Austria negotiated the GCM on behalf of the EU. The Global Compact is not an international treaty, and it will not be formally binding under international law.\n\nOn 19 September 2016, the nations of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. The Declaration recognized a need for more cooperation between nations to manage migration effectively.. The declaration set off a process leading to the negotiation of the Global Compact for Migration.\n\nA resolution was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 April 2017, which decided on the modalities and timeline for the compact. The agreed upon process consisted of the following three phases:\n\nOn 9 March 2017, Louise Arbour was appointed by Secretary-General Guterres as his Special Representative for International Migration and was thus tasked with working with the nations and stakeholders to develop the compact.\n\nThere are 23 objectives listed in the draft agreement. These include collecting and using accurate and anonymized data to develop evidence-based migration policy, ensuring that all migrants have proof of identity, enhancing availability and flexibility for regular migration, encouraging cooperation for tracking missing migrants and saving lives, ensuring migrants can access basic services, and making provisions for both full inclusion of migrants and social cohesion.\n\nAustria, Australia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Israel, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland won’t attend an international conference in Moroccan city of Marrakesh to sign the agreement. The United States did not participate in the negotiation of the agreement, at the behest of President Trump.\n\nThe Chancellor of Austria, Sebastian Kurz, stated that the compact would reduce Austria's sovereignty and mix up the difference between illegal and legal immigration as well as that between economic and humanitarian immigration. Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu commented tersely: \"We have a duty to protect our borders against illegal infiltrators. That’s what we’ve done, and that’s what we will continue to do\". Slovak foreign minister Miroslav Lajčák had previously announced that he would step down from his position if the Slovak parliament, controlled by the coalition which he represented, were to reject the Compact.\n\nOn the 28 November 2018, the Romanian Foreign Minister has been authorized by the Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis, to sign the Migration Pact. Sources say that negotiations were carried out secretly for a long time before news broke out to the public. \n\nThere has also been some opposition in the German parliament, led by Alternative for Germany. In Finland, the opposition Finns Party opposes the treaty and demands a vote in parliament. The provisions disputed by the Finns in parliament are that both legal and illegal immigrants would be bestowed many of the same rights such as rights to basic services, that the treaty would not allow categorical detention of illegal immigrants, and that the treaty would make migration a human right.\nThe Government of Estonia remained divided on the issue and the country's position was to be decided by the Riigikogu. On November 26, Riigikogu passed a declaration which supported the compact. According to the Estonian Prime Minister, the declaration would provide the basis for the Governments decision to support the Global Compact for Migration.\nSwitzerland will not attend the conference for the formal adoption of the framework in December 2018. The decision was made because the parliament demanded a final say on whether the country would approve the compact, which would require more time. On 27 November, the Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen stated that he was supportive of the agreement, but that his government would form a coalition of European countries to create an opt-out. In Belgium, government party N-VA, including its Secretary of State for Migration Theo Francken, is against participating, while the three other government parties are in favour, creating a political deadlock.\n\n\n"}

Altogether the 250 member cities of the OWHC have a population of more than 130 million.\n\nDuring the first International Symposium of World Heritage Cities in Québec City in 1991 the participating 41 cities adopted the Québec City Declaration. This declaration states the desire to build a network of World Heritage Cities.\n\nAt the second International Symposium of World Heritage Cities in Fez, Morocco, the OWHC was founded in 1993. 56 participating cities decided on the mission, goals and powers of the organisation. At the Founding General Assembly the member cities elected the first Board of Directors and Secretary General.\n\nSince the first General Assembly the member cities have been meeting every two years. Listed below are the years, locations and topics of the previous General Assemblies.\n\nAny city may become a member of the OWHC if it possesses the following two characteristics. Firstly the city has to be the location of a living urban fabric of historic or contemporary interest. Its outstanding universal value has been recognized by the UNESCO and therefore has been registered in the World Heritage List. Secondly the city has to adhere to the values of the OWHC.\n\nThe General Assembly is the paramount authority of the OWHC. In it the member cities are represented by their mayor. To be able to take part in the General Assembly and have the right to vote the city has to be a member in good standing (pay the annual membership fee). The General Assembly meets every two years. Special Assemblies may be called by members or the Board of Directors.\n\nAt the General Assembly the mayors discuss issues concerning the mission and objectives of the OWHC and formulate relevant recommendations to the Board of Directors. The Assembly guides the activities of the Organization, studies and approves the Organization’s work program and controls the financial policy of the Organization.\n\nThe Board of Directors consists of eight mayors of members in good standing. It is elected by the General Assembly for two years. Directors may be elected two more times and therefore be directors for a maximum of six consecutive years. The Board of Directors meets at least once a year.\n\nAmong its duties are the implementation of the requests formulated and the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the planning of the organizations activities according to set up priorities. Furthermore, the Board of Directors examines the financial reports, authorizes the annual budget plan, prepares budget estimates and proposes their adoption to the general assembly. The Board of Directors also draws up the organization chart, the recruiting criteria and standards for the personnel of the General Secretariat and performs any other duty that could be assigned to it by the General Assembly. It is empowered to take all the measures required for the administration of the Organization and the attainment of its objectives.\n\nThe Board of Directors elects the President of the OWHC from among themselves. He is the chief executive officer of the OWHC and is tasked with the supervision, administration and management of the affairs of the Organization. He represents the OWHC at the national and international levels and binds the Organization in official acts.\n\nThe General Secretariat is headed by the Secretary General who is appointed by the General Assembly for a four-year term. He oversees the execution of mandates by the members, the day-to-day administration and personnel management and hiring. He also coordinates the activities of the OWHC, prepares the budget and the financial reports and ensures that the decisions of the Board of Directors and those of the members taken at the General Assembly are carried out.\n\nThe General Secretariat is supported in its duties by seven Regional Secretariats. They are groupings of cities that share cultural, linguistic or geographical affinities and/or have the same concerns and needs. Every member city of the OWHC is allowed to be part of one or more regions. The members of one region have to choose a city from among themselves as domicile for the Regional Secretariat, choose a Regional Coordinator and meet at least once a year. They serve as a link between the member cities of their particular region and the General Secretariat.\n\nThe seven Regional Secretariats are\n\nTo support the General Secretariat the Regional Secretariats assist in producing documents intended for members, data collection and the organization of relevant events. They aim to make it possible for each member to participate more extensively in the activities of the Organization, to foster communication and the exchange of information amongst themselves and to promote the development of the Organization and its presence and influence. To accomplish those aims the Regional Secretariats organize activities intended to promote the Organization´s values and objectives.\n\nThe OWHC has five official languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic. Of those English, French and Spanish are working languages.\n\nDuring the founding of the OWHC in 1993 the member cities defined the goals and mission the Organization should have in the future. At the fourth General Assembly in Evora (Portugal) in 1997 the OWHC confirmed the Organization´s association with the UNESCO and their joint efforts regarding World Heritage Cities in the UNESCO-OWHC agreement.\n\nThe OWHC aims for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention (\"Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage adopted by the UNESCO in 1972\"). It encourages cooperation and exchange of information and expertise among its member cities on both regional and international levels. The OWHC works in close collaboration with other organizations pursuing similar goals while promoting action likely to support the efforts of cities located in developing countries. It assists members to adapt and improve their management methods in relation to the specific requirements of having a site inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Moreover, the organization ensures better links between research undertaken by specialists and the needs of the local managements. In addition the Organization intends to help develop a sense of solidarity among its member cities and to sensitize the populations to heritage values and their protection.\n\nThe OWHC organizes meetings on international and regional levels. In addition to the biennial General Assemblies there are World Congresses, conferences, seminars and workshops. All those meetings deal with the challenges in the realm of management and strategies pertaining to the preservation and development of historic cities. To accomplish its goals the OWHC additionally offers various activities, programs and projects which aim to promote and support the maintenance, recognition and development of world heritage.\n\nCurrent projects include \"Youth on the Trail of World Heritage\", \"City2City\", \"The Jean-Paul-L’Allier Prize for Heritage\", an International Video Production Competition, the \"Solidarity day of World Heritage Cities\", \"Mayors&Heritage\" and \"Case Studies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

PECC has 23 full member committees Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Chile; China; Colombia; Ecuador; Hong Kong; Indonesia; Japan; Korea; Malaysia; Mexico; Mongolia; New Zealand; Peru; the Philippines; Singapore; Taiwan; Thailand; the United States; Vietnam and the Pacific Island Forum, one associate member: France (Pacific Territories), and 2 institutional members: Pacific Trade and Development Conference (PAFTAD) and the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC).\n\nThe Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) was founded in 1980 at the initiative of Mr Masayoshi Ohira and Mr Malcolm Fraser, then Prime Ministers of Japan and Australia respectively. Its founding name was the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference with the final word changed to Council years later. The Council brings together leading thinkers, and decision makers from government and business in an informal setting to discuss and formulate ideas on the most significant challenges facing the Asia Pacific. It regularly develops and advocates regional policy initiatives to aid in the stable economic development of the region.\n\nPECC’s regional community building efforts led to the establishment of the official APEC process in 1989, the Council is one of the three official observers of the APEC process.\n\nParticipation in the PECC Process depends on a commitment to economic cooperation in the Pacific. PECC participants, seek to achieve increased, open regional economic cooperation and interaction, while recognizing both the realities of, and the benefits accruing from, global interdependence and continuing to encourage increased economic cooperation and interaction with other nations and regions.\n\nPECC organizes an annual General Meeting to develop strategic perspectives to promote the Pacific Community. Participants in the PECC General Meeting are delegates from PECC member committees and observers.\n\nThere is a Standing Committee, the PECC's governing body, which consists of all of the full member committees, and two institutional members and invited associate member committees in a limited capacity. this SC meets once a year.\n\nThe Co-chairs are elected for 3-year terms, Dr Charles E.

Each work group is composed of representatives from member committees and, where applicable, other invited institutions and/or individuals.\n\nThe PECC International Secretariat is located in Singapore.\n\n\nPECC’s priority areas for research are decided by its governing body, the Standing Committee composed of the chairs of PECC’s member committees. PECC’s research is freely available on its website: www.pecc.org.\n\nPrior to 2005, the chair of the Standing Committee was the chair of the host of the next General Meeting. In 2005, PECC amended its charter to provide more continuity in its work. Dr Charles Morrison was elected as chair of the Standing Committee. In 2009, the PECC charter was further amended to introduce a co-chair system. The co-chairs are elected by consensus for a period of 3 years and may stand for re-election once. The co-chairs should provide continuity in leadership and should provide leadership for the organization from both sides of the Pacific (Article 3.5.7 of the PECC Charter). At its meeting in Singapore in April 2012, the Standing Committee re-elected Mr Jusuf Wanandi of Indonesia term and elected Ambassador Donald Campbell of Canada as its co-chairs. In 2015, the Standing Committee re-elected Ambassador Campbell for a second term and Ambassador Tang Guoqiang was elected as co-chair, succeeding Mr Wanandi. \n\n\nPECC’s daily operations are run by an International Secretariat based in Singapore. While PECC was founded in 1980 it did not establish an International Secretariat until 1990. From 1990 till 2005 the head of the International Secretariat was a Director General, from 2005 onwards a Secretary General.\n\nHeads of the PECC International Secretariat\n\nPECC General Meetings are open to the wider public and attended also by youth delegates who have been selected by their respective PECC member committees.\n\nYou delegates are expected to boost the knowledge and understanding of current situation of societies and economics in the Asia-Pacific region, through a comprehensive program.\nParticipating in numerous seminars and discussions within the official Youth Program, the selected youth delegates are also involved in all of the General Meetings and Standing Committees. The youth representatives are encouraged to present the discussion report, concerning given topic or agenda to the PECC Standing Committee. Such opportunity provides the youths to experience not only the friendly interaction with the distinguished panels, but also the admission of the youth delegates’ participation in the Standing Committee.\n\nhttp://www.pecc.org/blog/2010/10/30/2010-youth-delegation-report-on-food-security/\n\nhttp://www.pecc.org/blog/2011/10/31/2011-youth-delegates-report-on-pecc-20th-general-meeting/\n\n21st PECC General Meeting | Vancouver, Canada | June 3-5, 2013\n\nThe 21st General Meeting of PECC (PECC XXI) was hosted by CANCPEC (Canada committee) in Vancouver on June 3–5, 2013. It was held in conjunction with Canada-Asia 2013 and organized by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada.\n\nThe opening plenary session, 'Key Trends Shaping the Asia-Pacific\" examined the latest economic, political, and social trends in the Asia-Pacific, identifying the emerging opportunities and uncertainties in the region. Will slower economic growth be the norm in Asia over the next few years and how will this affect both the regional and global economy? What will be the impact of a rapidly growing urban population—particularly one with an increasing middle class with evolving needs and expectations? Given the two on-going regional trade negotiations, what will be the future of trade in the Asia Pacific?\n\nThe opening plenary session was followed by concurrent breakout sessions which covered diverse topics including: infrastructure deficit in the Asia-Pacific, creativity and innovation in Asia, promoting inclusive growth and resilient societies in Asia, green growth, and risks to growth in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nLater plenary sessions covered Canada's Asia strategy and how economies are responding to the rise of Asia. Thereafter, breakout sessions addressed Canada's contribution to sustainable growth in the Asia-Pacific, and preparation of Canada's next generation to compete in an international environment increasingly influenced by developments in Asia.\n\nThe last time PECC GM was held in Vancouver was in November 1986 when Mr. Eric Trigg served as the International Chair of PECC. PECC General Meetings are open to the wider public and attended also by youth delegates who have been selected by their respective PECC member committees.\n\n"}
{"id": "954324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=954324", "title": "Plenipotentiary", "text": "Plenipotentiary\n\nThe word plenipotentiary (from the Latin \"plenus\" \"full\" and \"potens\" \"powerful\") has two meanings. As a noun, it refers to a person who has \"full powers\". In particular, the term commonly refers to a diplomat fully authorized to represent a government as a prerogative (e.g., ambassador). As an adjective, \"plenipotentiary\" refers to something—an edict, assignment, etc.—that confers \"full powers\".\n\nBefore the era of rapid international transport or essentially instantaneous communication (such as telegraph in the mid-19th century and then radio), diplomatic mission chiefs were granted full (\"plenipotentiary\") powers to represent their government in negotiations with their host nation. Conventionally, any representations made or agreements reached with a plenipotentiary would be recognized and complied with by their government.\n\nHistorically, the common generic term for high diplomats of the crown or state was \"minister\". It therefore became customary to style the chiefs of full ranking missions as Minister Plenipotentiary. This position was roughly equivalent to the modern Ambassador, a term that historically was reserved mainly for missions between the great powers and also relating to the dogal (city) state of Venice.\n\nPermanent missions at a bilateral level were chiefly limited to relations between large, neighboring or closely allied powers, rarely to the very numerous small principalities, hardly worth the expense. However, diplomatic missions were dispatched for specific tasks, such as negotiating a treaty bilaterally, or via a conference, such as the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire. In such cases, it was normal to send a representative minister empowered to cast votes. For example, in the Peace Treaty of Versailles (1783), ending the American Revolution, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin and John Jay were named \"minister plenipotentiary of the United States\" to the Netherlands, France and Spain, respectively.\n\nBy the time of the Vienna Congress (1814–15), which codified diplomatic relations, Ambassador had become a common title, and was established as the only class above Minister Plenipotentiary. Ambassadors gradually became the standard title for bilateral mission chiefs, as their ranks no longer tended to reflect the importance of the states, which came to be treated as formally equal.\n\nIn modern times, heads of state and of government, and more junior ministers and officials, can easily meet or speak with each other personally. Therefore, ambassadors arguably do not require plenipotentiary powers. However they continue to be designated and accredited as \"extraordinary and plenipotentiary\".\n\nOutside of diplomatic plenipotentiaries, some permanent administrators are also given plenipotentiary powers. Central governments have sometimes conferred plenipotentiary status (either formally or de facto) on territorial governors. This has been most likely to occur when the remoteness of the administered territory made it impracticable for the central government to maintain and exercise its policies, laws and initiatives directly.\n\nThere have been instances where a mandate was conferred publicly on a senior official, such as a minor member of the ruling house (sometimes with the title of viceroy) but with secret instructions drastically limiting the position's power by conferring plenipotentiary status on a more junior administrator, possibly of lower social class or caste. Thus, the formal position an individual holds has not always been a reliable indicator of actual plenipotentiary authority.\n\nEven in modern times, the Plenipotentiary title has been revived sometimes, for example for the administrators of protectorates or in other cases of indirect rule.\n\nExamples of plenipotentiary administration are given below.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be impractical to hold a new referendum for each step of series of negotiated changes, and thus ministers might ask an electorate for plenipotentiary powers in advance, as in the South African apartheid referendum, 1992. Prior to the referendum, the state president F. W. de Klerk had already implemented extensive reforms e.g. removing the Group Areas Act. However, his right to negotiate these reforms was questioned by other parties e.g. Andries Treurnicht's Conservative Party, particularly in response to the National Party's Potchefstroom by-election defeat in February 1992. Given how heavily entrenched apartheid was in the South African legal system at the time, Mr. de Klerk needed to nullify many previous bills and pass many new ones, making a series of individual referenda impractical. Consequently, as a practical solution to the political deadlock, Mr. de Klerk held a referendum on 17 March 1992 to ask the white South African electorate to give him plenipotentiary powers.\n\nOn May 18, 2000, in the post-Soviet Russian Federation the title Plenipotentiary of the President was established for the appointees of the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, in each of the seven federal districts created on May 13: Dalnevostochny (Far Eastern), Privolzhsky (Volga Region), Severo-Zapadny (North Western), Sibirsky (Siberian), Tsentralny (Central), Uralsky (Ural) and Yuzhny (Southern).\n\nThis word has been voted as one of the ten English words that are hardest to translate in June 2004 by Today Translations, a British translation company. However, almost the exact word exists in at least some of the Romance languages (such as Portuguese - \"plenipotenciário\"; French - \"plénipotentiaire\"; Romanian - \"plenipotențiar\"; Spanish - \"plenipotenciario\"; Italian - \"plenipotenziario\"), with exactly the same meaning; the Albanian word \"i/e plotfuqishëm\" sounds similar, although it has native roots; other languages have their own equivalents; for instance, German - \"Bevollmächtigt(er)\" (adjective or noun), Dutch \"gevolmachtigd(e)\", Swedish \"fullmäktig\", Norwegian \"fullmektig\" (all these Germanic cases are literal parallels); Serbian \"punomoćan\" (пуномоћан in Cyrillic); Russian полномочный (полный \"full\", мочь \"to be in power, to be able\"); Czech \"zplnomocněný\" (\"plno\" \"full\", \"moc\" \"power\"); Slovak \"splnomocnený\" (\"plno\" \"full\", \"moc\" \"power\"); Slovenian \"pooblaščeni\" (adjective) or \"pooblaščênec\" (noun); Polish \"pełnomocnik\" (\"pełno\" \"of full\", \"moc\" \"power\"); Bulgarian пълномощен (\"pǎlnomošten\"); Finnish \"täysivaltainen\"; Greek πληρεξούσιος \"plirexoúsios\"; Turkish \"tam yetkili\"; Tatar \"wäqälätle\".\n\n\n"}
