{"id": "59049021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59049021", "title": "Cas Oorthuys", "text": "Cas Oorthuys\n\nCasparus Bernardus Oorthuys (November 1, 1908 – July 22, 1975), known as Cas, was a Dutch photographer and designer active from the 1930s until the 1970s.\n\nCasparus Bernardus (Cas) Oorthuys, born 1908 in Leiden, was the fourth child and first son of Dorothea Catherina Helena Christina de Stoppelaar (1875-1948) and Reverend Gerardus Oorthuys (1876-1959), who started his career as a pastor in Brakel. In 1909 the family moved to Amsterdam where from 1921 Oorthuys attended the Amsterdam Lyceum for three years before enrolling in the technical school in the Timorplein in Amsterdam. From 1926-30 he studied architecture at the School for Architecture, Decorative Arts and Art Crafts in Haarlem and, after the closure of this school in 1927, in the architecture department of the Haarlem MTS, during which time he joined the free-thinking Dutch Association of Abstinent Students, and first took up photography.\n\nIn 1930 Oorthuys joined the municipality of Amsterdam as a structural engineer and was involved, among other things, in the design of the market halls on the Jan van Galenstraat. In 1932 he, with many others, lost his job as a result of the economic crisis. Unemployed, he came into contact with the Communist Party of Holland, which he joined. Oorthuys sought work as a graphic designer and photographer and with the painter Jo Voskuil started an advertising agency OV 20 (\"Oorthuys-Vos 20\") from 1932 to 1935. \n\nOorthuys was involved with and a member of various left-wing organisations in his field. In 1936 he became permanent photographer at De Arbeiderspers. He produced photography and graphics for communist and anti-fascist organisations and in the tradition of \"workers' photography\" he documented poverty, police violence, the unemployed, homeless people and evictions for magazines, book illustrations and book covers and exhibitions.\n\nDuring the war Oorthuys helped forge identity papers and photographed clandestinely for the Underground Camera to document the activities of the German occupiers, and also the awful Hongerwinter, the Dutch Famine of 1944/45. During the postwar recovery he recorded the Nuremberg war crimes trials and the rebuilding of his homeland. \n\nOn August 5, 1938 Oorthuys had divorced teacher Gezina Broerse (1910-1997) whom he had married on August 31, 1932 and with whom he had two children. He married scriptwriter Lydia Krienen on April 3, 1940, just before the war broke out in May. During the Occupation, Oorthuys became involved in the Personal Identification Centre established in 1942 and made passport photos for fake ID cards, while earning a bare living on an assignment from Contact publishing company for a book about agriculture. In May 1944, when he took ration cards to the architect J.J. van der Linden and others in hiding, he was arrested by the Germans and imprisoned in camp Amersfoort. Unexpectedly, he was released again in August, presumably at the interposition of Nico de Haas who, despite having been with Oorthuys one of the founders in 1936 of the ‘photo and film’ group of the Association for the Defense of Cultural Law (BKVK) in preparation of the anti-fascist exhibition De Olympiade Onder Dictatuur (DOOD), had quickly worked up to become a prominent Dutch SS man after the German invasion.\n\nOn release Oorthuys connected with De Ondergedoken (‘Underground’) Camera, formed around Dolle Dinsdag on the initiative of the German emigrant Fritz Kahlenberg and the former soldier Tony van Renterghem; ‘Underground’ because the Nazi occupiers declared a complete ban on “photographing, filming, drawing, and displaying persons and things in any other way outside of domestic spaces” from November 20, 1944. The group photographed in any way they could, keeping cameras concealed and shooting 'from the hip'; consequently the quality of the imagery is distinguished by its haphazard nature; often with tilted, uncentered framing and other accidental effects. Their aim was initially to document the Allies’ liberation which was longer in coming than hoped, and instead they recorded a severe winter of hunger and resistance in photos that have become the image of the German occupation, especially Cas Oorthuys’ picture of a woman with a piece of bread in close-up. A variation was published on the cover of \"Amsterdam tijdens den hongerwinter\" (‘Amsterdam During the Winter of Hunger’) published by Contact / De Bezige Bij, in 1947, while the now more famous image from this series reached an audience of 9 million through the 1955 exhibition and publication \"The Family of Man.\"\n\nAfter the war Oorthuys had maintained the left-wing convictions that had prompted his joining the worker-photographer movement Vereeniging van Arbeiders-Fotografen in 1932, and with his equally idealistic friends Carel Blazer, Eva Besnyö, and Emmy Andriesse, formed the Vereniging van Beoefenaars der Gebonden Kunsten, the GKf, on September 1, 1945. \n\nIn keeping with his convictions, from January until March 1947, Oorthuys, accompanied by his writer the educationalist Albert de la Court, travelled through Java and Borneo in Indonesia commissioned by ABC-Press and the publishing house Contact. In July 1947 the resultant book \"Een staat in wording\" (A Nascent State), promoted a peaceful solution to the Indonesian struggle for independence, and reviews reveal its impact on changing attitudes to the colony as the Netherlands tried to re-exert its control, but before the book appeared, a violent revolution was in full swing.\n\nFrom 1945-75 he produced numerous books and reports on the post-war reconstruction in Dutch industry, agriculture, regions and cities and undertook reportage in Indonesia (1947), photographed the Peace Conference in Paris (1948), and in 1950 produced reportage in West Irian. \n\nWith Lydia, Oorthuys had three children; sisters Fenna and Hansje, and the youngest a son, Frank, born in 1960. Photography became a family concern; during the summer holidays from 1951 they traveled to make 28 photo pocketbook in a series for Contact-Photo books, starting with \"Bonjour Paris\" with a cover by Jan van Keulen, each on a different country, promoting tourism for a now more prosperous Dutch population. The compact books were designed around the square format of the Rolleiflex that Oorthuys favoured and several were marketed by foreign publishers in English, French and German language editions. \n\nDuring this period he also designed five postage stamps (1951) and two more in 1964. On each of the five stamps, a portrait of a child, among them his own daughter Hansje, is montaged against the background of a typical aspect of the Netherlands, showing the (housing) construction and industry. For the Belgian Ministry of Information he covered the Congo in 1952, with further reports on cattle raising in Jersey (1954), followed by stories on Macedonia, Serbia and Spain (1955)\n\n\nOorthuys died unexpectedly on July 22, 1975 in Amsterdam, at the age of 66, having only three months earlier designed a postage stamp on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Liberation. \n\nAt the end of his career he left 500,000 pictures, a huge archive faithfully maintained by his wife Lydia who until she was in her seventies sold its imagery to a variety of clients before she donated the entire collection to Nederlands Fotomuseum.\n\n\n\n\n"}

For over five decades, he served as the evening meteorologist at WJW-TV, the Fox Broadcasting Company-affiliated television station in Cleveland, Ohio. He holds the Guinness World Record for longest career as a weather forecaster.\n\nAfter graduating from Green High School in what is now Green, Ohio, in 1949, Goddard began his weather career while taking classes on meteorology during a stint with the United States Air Force from 1949 through the early 1950s. During this time, Goddard's most notable assignment was forecasting for atmospheric nuclear weapons tests by the United States Atomic Energy Commission in the Pacific.\n\nHe then attended Kent State University, where he majored in drama and broadcasting. While there he had notable success as the lead character, Curly, in the school's production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\"\n\nAfter graduating from Kent State in 1960, he joined the weather team at Westinghouse Broadcasting-owned KYW-TV (now WKYC-TV) in Cleveland a year later; while at KYW-TV, Goddard worked alongside sports anchor Jim Graner. Goddard was one of several employees of KYW-TV who agreed to move to WRCV-TV in Philadelphia in June 1965, after Westinghouse was allowed by the FCC to reverse a station trade with NBC in 1956 based on coercion in order for Westinghouse to retain their NBC affiliations; the KYW calls also moved back to Philadelphia. However, Goddard did not take a liking to Philadelphia, and returned to Cleveland several months later. In 1966, Goddard became the chief meteorologist at WJW-TV, where he would work for the remainder of his career.\n\nAfter returning to Cleveland, Goddard also took a job with the NFL's Cleveland Browns as the team's official statistician for home games. Then a CBS affiliate, WJW carried Browns games at the time as part of their NFL play-by-play contract until the 1970 AFL-NFL merger (due to the Browns move to the AFC), at which point the games moved to WKYC – this was a key factor in his having joined the station. He held this position from 1966 to 2011, with the exception of a three-year period from 1996–1999 when the franchise was suspended as the old Browns franchise moved to Baltimore and Cleveland was given a new team.\n\nFrom August 1977 to January 1979, Goddard also hosted WJW's version of \"Bowling for Dollars\", a syndicated franchised game show. He has also appeared in numerous skits on WJW's popular \"Big Chuck and Lil' John Show\" over the years, and does occasional stage work.\n\nIn honor of Goddard's 50 years on Cleveland TV, most of which was spent at WJW, the portion of South Marginal Road (the southern frontage road of the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway) in front of the WJW studios was renamed \"Dick Goddard Way\" on May 23, 2011.\n\nIn December 2014, at age 83, Goddard signed a \"multi-year\" contract renewal with WJW. On May 18, 2016, Goddard announced that he would retire from his weather duties in November 2016, while continuing his animal advocacy and remaining host of the Woollybear Festival. He delivered his last forecast on the station on November 22, 2016, with the station's weather center renamed for him. He will continue to tape animal advocacy and adoption segments for WJW.\n\nIn 1973 Goddard created the first Woollybear Festival, a day-long family event dedicated to teaching children about the weather, family fun, and animals. Some of the events include a caterpillar race, animal costume contests, and musical performances.\n\nGoddard has been an outspoken opponent of animal abuse. \"Dick Goddard's Law\", a bill to increase the severity of penalties for abuse, was introduced into the Ohio General Assembly in 2013 and reintroduced in 2015. The 2015 version was signed into law on June 13, 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "210472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210472", "title": "Pancake", "text": "Pancake\n\nA pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies.\n\nThe pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. In Britain, pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a crêpe. In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder). American pancakes are similar to Scotch pancakes or drop scones. A \"crêpe\" is a thin Breton pancake of French origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles. A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is a \"palačinke\", a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam, cheese cream, chocolate, or ground walnuts, but many other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used.\n\nWhen potato is used as a major portion of the batter, the result is a \"potato pancake\". Commercially prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries. When buttermilk is used in place of or in addition to milk, the pancake develops a tart flavor and becomes known as a buttermilk pancake, which is common in Scotland and the US. Buckwheat flour can be used in a pancake batter, making for a type of buckwheat pancake, a category that includes Blini, Kaletez, Ploye, and Memil-buchimgae.\n\nPancakes may be served at any time of the day with a variety of toppings or fillings including jam, fruit, syrup, chocolate chips, or meat, but in America they are typically considered a breakfast food. Pancakes serve a similar function to waffles. In Britain and the Commonwealth, they are associated with Shrove Tuesday, commonly known as \"Pancake Day\", when, historically, perishable ingredients had to be used up before the fasting period of Lent.\n\nThe Ancient Greeks made pancakes called τηγανίτης (\"tēganitēs\"), ταγηνίτης (\"tagēnitēs\") or ταγηνίας (\"tagēnias\"), all words deriving from τάγηνον (\"tagēnon\"), \"frying pan\". The earliest attested references to \"tagenias\" are in the works of the 5th-century BC poets Cratinus and Magnes. Tagenites were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and were served for breakfast. Another kind of pancake was σταιτίτης (\"staititēs\"), from σταίτινος (\"staitinos\"), \"of flour or dough of spelt\", derived from σταῖς (\"stais\"), \"flour of spelt\". Athenaeus mentions, in his Deipnosophistae, \"staititas\" topped with honey, sesame, and cheese. The Middle English word \"pancake\" appears in English in the 15th century.\n\nThe Ancient Romans called their fried concoctions \"alia dulcia\", Latin for \"other sweets\". These were much different from what are known as pancakes today.\n\nPancakes in the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia) are known as \"injera\" (sometimes transliterated as \"enjera\", \"budenaa\" (Oromo), or \"canjeero\" (Somali)). \"Injera\" is a yeast-risen flatbread with a unique, slightly spongy texture. Traditionally, it is made out of teff flour and is a national dish in Ethiopia and Eritrea. \"Canjeero\", also known as \"lahooh\" or \"lahoh\", is a similar kind of flatbread eaten in Somalia and Yemen.\n\nIn Eritrea and Ethiopia, \"injera\" are usually served with one or more stews known as \"wat\" or with salads (especially, for instance, during periods of Ethiopian Orthodox fasting) or with other injera (\"injera firfir\"). The right hand is used to tear small pieces from the \"injera\" to use to pick up and eat the stews or salads. The \"injera\" under these stews soaks up juices and flavours and, after the stews and salads are finished, is also consumed. \"Injera\" thus acts simultaneously as food, eating utensil and plate. When the \"tablecloth\" formed by the \"injera\" is finished, the meal is over.\n\n\"Lahoh\" is a pancake-like bread originating in Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen. It is often eaten along with honey, ghee and tea. During lunch, \"lahoh\" is sometimes consumed with curry, soup or stew.\n\nIn Kenya, pancakes are eaten for breakfast as an alternative to bread. They are served plain with the sugar already added to the batter to sweeten them. Kenyan pancakes are similar to English pancakes and French crepes.\n\nA \"pancake\" in South Africa is a crêpe. In Afrikaans, it is known as a \"pannekoek\" (plural \"pannekoeke\") and, traditionally, is prepared on gas stoves and eaten on wet and cold days. \"Pannekoeke\" are usually served with cinnamon-flavoured sugar (and, sometimes, lemon juice) that is either allowed to dissolve into and soften them or, if their crispy texture is to be retained, eaten immediately. They are a staple at Dutch Reformed Church fêtes.\n\n\"Plaatkoekies\" (\"flapjacks\", or lit. \"plate cookies\") are American-style \"silver dollar\" pancakes.\n\nA variation of the \"pannekoek\" is the South African crumpet, made from self-raising flour, eggs, milk and a pinch of salt. The smooth batter is fried in butter to produce a slightly raised flat cake. Crumpets are always served hot, usually for breakfast, with butter and golden syrup.\n\nIn Uganda, pancakes are locally made with bananas (one of the staple foods of the country) and usually served as a breakfast or as a snack option.\n\nBanana pancakes are a menu item in Western-oriented backpackers' cafes in Asian countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, India, and China. This has elicited the term \"Banana Pancake Trail\".\n\nChinese pancakes may be either savoury or sweet, and are generally made with dough rather than batter. The dough mostly consists of water, flour, and vegetable oil. The dish can be served as a side, usually alongside duck, or as a snack, topped with scallions along with hot and sour sauce.\n\nIndia has many styles of pancake. Variations range from their taste to the main ingredient used. All are made without the use of added raising agents.\n\nPancakes prepared using a north Indian cooking style are known as \"cheela\". Sweet \"cheela\" are made using sugar or jaggery with a wheat flour-based batter. North Indian salty pancakes are made using batter prepared from gram flour or green gram paste (\"moong daal\") and are sometimes garnished with \"paneer\", a cottage-style cheese. \n\n\"Dosa\", \"appam\", \"neer dosa\" and \"uttapam\" are pancakes made in a south Indian cooking style. They are prepared by fermenting rice batter and split-skinned urad bean (black lentil) blended with water. \"Meetha pooda\" – sweet pancakes often eaten with pickles and chutney – are a common breakfast food item in the Punjab. Most of the \"pitha\" in Assam are types of pancakes served on occasions such as Bihu festivals. The Bengali semi-sweet pancake \"pati-shapta\" is stuffed with grated coconut or thickened milk.\n\nIn Western India, the multi-grain \"thalipeeth\" is popular. In Goa, a traditional crêpe-like pancake known as \"alebele\" or \"alle belle\" is eaten at tea-time. It is usually filled with jaggery and coconut.\n\nIn Eastern India, \"malpuas\" are sometimes prepared in the form of pancakes.\n\nThe Indonesian pancake \"serabi\" is made from rice flour and coconut milk. The dish is often served with kinca, a thick, brown-colored coconut sugar syrup. Other toppings may include sugar, ground peanuts, sliced bananas, jackfruit, and other fruits, and chocolate. Other variations include cheddar cheese, corned beef, shredded chicken, and sausage.\n\nIn Japan, \"okonomiyaki\" are made from flour, egg, cabbage and a choice of ingredients. \"Oyaki\" are pancakes often stuffed with anko, eggplant, or nozawana. \"Dorayaki\" are a sort of sandwich made from Western-style pancakes and anko. Sweet crepes are also very popular.\n\nIn Korea, pancakes include \"jeon\", \"pajeon\", \"bindaetteok\", \"kimchijeon\", and \"hotteok\". These may be served during all times of the day as side dishes or just snacks. Variants of the dish use the batter of the pancake to make deep fried vegetables, meat, or fish.\n\nThe traditional Malay pancake in Malaysia and Singapore is called \"lempeng\". Cooked very similarly to an American or Canadian style pancake albeit without a rising agent, it is usually served during the breakfast hours with curry, \"rendang\", or \"sambal\".\n\nIn Nepal, the Newar have a savoury rice pancake called \"chataamari\" cooked with meat or eggs on top. This dish is also known as the \"Newari Pizza\", as it is served and eaten similarly to American pizza. Besides being served with meat or eggs, it can also be served plain.\n\nIn Pakistani cuisine, \"rishiki\" is a pancake, slightly thicker than a crepe, which is made from whole wheat flour, water and eggs and usually served with honey. It is widely consumed in the far north and is a staple of Chitrali cuisine.\n\nIn the Philippines, \"salukara\", a type of \"bibingka\", is a pancake made from rice flour, eggs, and coconut milk. The batter is placed in a clay pan lined with banana leaves or greased with oil, and is grilled over hot coal.\n\nSavory pancakes also include \"tortang talong\" (eggplant omelette), \"pudpod\" (smoked fish flake pancakes), and \"okoy\" (a pancake made of battered shrimp, pumpkin, or sweet potatoes).\n\nThe North American variety of pancakes, or \"hotcakes\", is also recognized, and despite it being commonly prepared for breakfast, it can also be eaten as an afternoon snack, with street kiosks selling small hotcakes topped with margarine and sugar.\n\nIn Vietnamese cuisine there are a variety of traditional pancakes; these include \"bánh xèo\" in the north, \"bánh khọt\" in the south, and \"bánh căn\" and \"bánh khoái\" in central Vietnam.\n\nIn Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, pancakes are called \"palatschinke\", \"palačinka\" and \"palacinka\", respectively (plural: \"palatschinken\", \"palačinky\", and \"palacinky\"). \"Kaiserschmarrn\" is an Austrian pancake including raisins, almonds, apple jam or small pieces of apple, split into pieces, and sprinkled with powdered sugar. In Romania, they are called \"clătită\" (plural: \"clătite\"). In countries of former Yugoslavia, they are called \"palačinka\" (plural: \"palačinke\"). In these languages, the word derives from the Latin \"placenta\", meaning \"cake\". These pancakes are thin and filled with apricot, plum, lingonberry, apple or strawberry jam, chocolate sauce, or hazelnut spread. Eurokrem, Nutella, and Lino-Lada fillings are favourite among the younger population. A traditional version includes filling pancakes with cheese, pouring yoghurt over them, and then baking in an oven.\n\nEastern-Slavic cuisines have a long tradition of pancake cooking and include a large variety of pancake types. In Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, pancakes may be breakfast food, appetizer, main course, or dessert.\n\n\"Blini\" () and \"mlynci\" () are thin pancakes, somewhat thicker than crêpes, made from wheat or buckwheat flour, butter, eggs, and milk, with yeast added to the batter. Blini/mlynci cooking dates back to pagan traditions and feasts, which are reflected in today's \"pancake week\" celebrated in the winter before the Great Lent. In pre-Christian times, blini and mlynci were symbolically considered by early Slavic peoples as a symbol of the sun, due to their round form.\n\nBlintzes ( \"blinchiki\") are thin crêpes made without yeast. Filled blintzes are also referred to as \"nalysnyky\" (), \"nalistniki\" () or \"nalesniki\" (). A filling such as jam, fruits, quark, or cottage cheese, potato, cooked ground meat or chicken, and even chopped mushrooms, bean sprouts, cabbage, and onions, is rolled or enveloped into a pre-fried blintz and then the blintz is lightly re-fried, sautéed, or baked.\n\nSmall thick pancakes are called \"oladyi\" () or \"oladky\" (). The batter may contain various additions, such as apple and raisins.\n\n\"Æbleskiver\" are traditional Danish pancakes made in a distinctive spherical shape. (The name literally means \"apple slices\" in Danish, although apples are not an ingredient.) \"Æbleskiver\" are cooked on the stove top by baking in a special cast iron pan with several hemispherical indentations. Batter is poured into the oiled indentations and as the \"æbleskiver\" begin to cook, they are turned with a knitting needle, skewer or fork to give the cakes their characteristic spherical shape. \"Æbleskiver\" are not sweet themselves but are traditionally served dipped in raspberry, strawberry, lingonberry or blackberry jam and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nFinnish pancakes greatly resemble \"plättar\" (see the description in the Sweden section below) and are called \"lettu\", \"lätty\", \"räiskäle\" or \"ohukainen\". In Finland pancakes are usually eaten as dessert with whipped cream or pancake-jam, sugar or vanilla ice cream. In Finnish, \"lettu\" and \"pannukakku\" (literally \"pancake\") have different meanings, the latter having a structurally closer resemblance to a hotcake, and is baked in an oven instead of using a frying pan. \"Ålandspannkaka\", literally \"pancake of Åland\", is an extra thick variety of oven-made pancake that includes the addition of cardamom and either rice pudding or semolina porridge to the dough.\n\n\"Crêpes\", popular in France, Belgium, Switzerland and Portugal, are made from flour, milk, and eggs. They are thin pancakes and are served with a sweet (fruit, ice cream, jam, chocolate spread) or savoury filling (cheese, ham, seafood, spinach). In Francophone Europe, crêpes are often sold in special stands. In Italy they are called \"crespelle\" or \"scrippelle\". In Brittany, a \"galette\" (or \"galette bretonne\") is a large thin pancake made of buckwheat flour, often cooked on one side only.\n\nCrêpes are popular in many South American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. They are consumed with sweet fillings (marmalade, dulce de leche) or with salty fillings (ground meat (Brazil), vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese).\n\nThey have also become popular East Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and China, where they are sold in crêpe stands and kiosks. They are often served with whipped cream and fruits, or non-sweet spreads such as vegetables.\n\n\"Farinata\" are popular in Mediterranean regions, including Nice. Also called \"socca\", these are pancakes made from chickpea flour and seasoned with black pepper. They are popular street food in Nice.\n\nGerman pancakes are known as \"Pfannkuchen\" (from the German \"Pfanne\" and \"Kuchen\" meaning \"pan\" and \"cake\") except in Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony, where \"Pfannkuchen\" are Berliner pastries and pancakes are known as \"Eierkuchen\". They are generally thicker than French-style crêpes and usually served with sweet or, occasionally, savoury fillings. Usage of a leavening agent or yeast is uncommon. Fried apple rings covered by pancake dough and served with sugar and cinnamon are called \"Apfelküchle\". \"Kaiserschmarrn\", a thick but light caramelized pancake popular in Bavaria and regions of the former Austria-Hungary, is usually split into pieces, filled with fruits or nuts, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a fruit sauce. It is believed that this was first prepared for Kaiser Franz Joseph I of Austria.\n\nIn Swabia, sliced pancake strips (\"flädle\") are often served in soup.\n\nEnglish pancakes have three key ingredients: plain flour, eggs, and milk, though Gervase Markham's 1615 version in \"The English Huswife\" used water instead of milk, and added sweet spices. The batter is runny and forms a thin layer on the bottom of the frying pan when the pan is tilted. It may form some bubbles during cooking, which results in a pale pancake with dark spots where the bubbles were, but the pancake does not rise. English pancakes are similar to French crêpes and Italian crespelle. They may be eaten as a sweet dessert with the traditional topping of lemon juice and sugar, drizzled with golden syrup, or wrapped around savoury stuffings and eaten as a main course. On Shrove Tuesday, it is custom to eat pancakes, and lemon juice and sugar may be added on top. Yorkshire pudding is made from a similar recipe, but baked instead of fried. This batter rises because the air beaten into the batter expands, without the need for baking powder; the result is eaten as part of the traditional roast beef dinner. Oatcakes are a savoury variety of pancake particularly associated with Staffordshire.\n\nPancakes (also called \"Scotch pancakes\" or \"Scottish pancakes\") are more like the American type. In parts of Scotland they are also referred to as \"drop scones\" or \"dropped scones\". They are made from flour, eggs, sugar, buttermilk or milk, salt, bicarbonate of soda and cream of tartar. Smaller than American or English pancakes at about 3.5 in / 9 cm in diameter, they are made by the traditional method of dropping batter onto a griddle (a \"girdle\" in Northumberland or in Scots). They can be served with jam and cream or just with butter. In Scotland pancakes are generally served at teatime.\n\nWelsh pancakes, known as \"crempog\", \"ffroes\" and other names, vary considerably. Generally, they are thick and layered on top of each other to form a tall mock-Cake, but Some are very much like American pancakes, others may be made with yeast (called \"crempog furum\") or oatmeal (although this is also true of American pancakes) and some are like Scotch pancakes. \"Crumpets\" and \"pikelets\" are sometimes considered a variety of pancake.\n\nGreek pancakes are called \"tiganites\" (\"τηγανίτες\", from the ancient Greek \"τηγανίτης\") and are popular across Greece and Cyprus. They are slightly thicker than crêpes and can be sweet or savoury. Their main ingredients are flour, olive oil or butter, milk and eggs. They are usually drizzled with honey and cinnamon, and sometimes topped with cheese, nuts, fruits or vegetables. Various small shops in Cyprus called creperies sell crepes, either savoury or sweet varieties. Tiganites can be served for breakfast or dessert, and in some places like Corfu and Patras are customarily served in the feast days of Saint Spyridon and Saint Andrew. In Cyprus the pancake recipe is used for a similar dish such as Genoese canelloni – ground meat with tomato sauce, cheese, and sometimes bechamel sauce – instead of the traditional cannelloni dried pasta sold at supermarkets.\n\nIn Hungary, pancakes known as \"palacsinta\" (derived from the Latin \"placenta\") are made from flour, milk or soda water, sugar, and eggs. Sweet wine is added to the batter. The filling is usually jam, sugared and ground walnuts or poppy seeds, sugared cottage cheese, sugared cocoa, or cinnamon powder, but meat and mushroom fillings are also used (see \"Hortobágyi palacsinta\"). \"Gundel palacsinta\" is a Hungarian pancake stuffed with walnuts, zest, raisins and rum that is served in chocolate sauce and is often flambéed. Hungarian pancakes are served as a main dish or as a dessert.\n\nIcelandic crepe-like pancakes are called \"pönnukaka\" (pl. \"pönnukökur\"), whereas smaller, thicker and denser pancakes resembling North American pancakes are called \"lumma\" or \"skonsa\". The pancakes are usually a bit browner than traditional Swedish ones. \"Pönnukökur\" are usually cooked on a special Icelandic pancake pan, which is made to get the pancake as thin as possible, which is traditionally never washed or rinsed, not even with water. \"Pönnukökur\" are traditionally served rolled up with sugar or folded with jam and whipped cream, but if eaten at a café they might contain ice cream instead. Pönnukökur are also a popular dessert in North America among people of Icelandic descent.\n\nIn Iceland, North American-style pancakes are cut in half and used as sandwich bread, similar to Icelandic flatbread.\n\nIn the Netherlands, pancakes are known as \"pannenkoeken\" and are mostly eaten at lunch and dinner time. Pancake restaurants are popular with families and serve many sweet, savoury, and stuffed varieties. Pannenkoeken are slightly thicker than crêpes and usually quite large, or so in diameter. The batter is egg-based and fillings include such items as sliced apples, cheese, ham, bacon, and candied ginger, alone or in combination. \"Stroop\", a thick molasses-like sugar beet-based syrup is also popular, particularly in a classic filling of bacon and stroop. \"Poffertjes\" are another Dutch quick bread, similar to American pancakes but sweeter and much smaller. Made in a specially dimpled copper or cast iron pan, they are flipped once with a fork. Unlike Dutch pancakes, the batter for poffertjes contains baking powder and therefore they have a softer interior than pancakes. A spekdik is a pancake like-food which is traditionally eaten in the provinces Groningen and Drenthe in the Netherlands around New Year. Unlike pancakes, a spekdik is cooked with a waffle iron. The main ingredients of a spekdik are syrup, eggs and rye-flour, and some varieties include bacon.\n\nIn Poland, thin crêpe-style pancakes are called \"naleśniki\" (pronounced \"naleshniki\"). They are usually rolled and served with a variety of savoury or sweet fillings as a main dish or a dessert. Sweet fillings include fresh fruits (e.g. bilberries), jams (often apple jam), and soft white cheese with sugar. Savoury fillings include fried vegetables, fried chicken, minced meat, spinach, and a variety of added ingredients such as potatoes, mushrooms, cabbage or ham. Another Polish dish reassembling pancakes are \"racuchy\". They are smaller and thicker than \"naleśniki\" and can be stuffed with apple slices.\n\nSpanish pancakes are called \"frixuelos\" or \"filloas\" and are very popular in the north-west of Spain. They are made from flour, milk, and eggs. They are thin and are usually served with a large amount of sugar or honey. They are a typical Carnival sweet dessert in Galicia, Asturias and León.\n\nNordic pancakes are similar to the French-style crêpes. In some Nordic countries, they are served with jam or fruit, especially lingonberries (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savoury fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called \"pannkakor\", which resemble the French crêpes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup, the Swedish cuisine also has \"plättar\" — very small pancakes, which resemble tiny English pancakes, and are usually fried in a special pan called a \"plättlagg\", a sort of frying pan with indentations to allow for several (normally seven) to be made at once. Another type of pancake is the \"ugnspannkaka\" (oven pancake), which is very thick and resembles German pancakes, and is baked in the oven. There is also a variant which includes fried pork in the batter, \"fläskpannkaka\" (pork pancake). Potato pancakes called \"raggmunk\" contain shredded raw potato, and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing \"rårakor\"). \"Raggmunk\" and \"rårakor\" are traditionally eaten with pork rinds and lingonberry jam. A special Swedish pancake is \"saffron pancake\" from Gotland, made with saffron and rice, baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special \"Swedish pancake\" is the \"äggakaka\" (eggcake), also called \"skånsk äggakaka\" (Scanian eggcake), which is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is a lot thicker and also much more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan, is about 1½ to 2 inches thick, and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically bilberry) or sugar.\n\nCosta Rican \"chorreadas\" are similar to \"cachapas\".\n\nGuatemalan pancakes are called \"panqueques\". They are made with the same ingredients as American pancakes. The toppings are usually fruits and honey. They are a very popular breakfast meal in Guatemala. Depending on the region, the \"panqueque\" can be thin as a crêpe or as fluffy as a North American pancake.\n\nMexican \"hotcakes\" are similar to American pancakes. Crêpes became popular toward the end of the 19th century after their introduction by the French sometime between the First French Intervention (1838) and the Second French Intervention in Mexico (1861–67). Hotcakes are often made with cornmeal, as well as, or instead of wheat flour. Hotcakes are popular breakfast items at restaurants throughout the country, and are often sold by street vendors in cities and during the local celebrations of towns through the day. They are also sold during fairs; the vendors sell a single hotcake topped with different sauces such as condensed milk, fruit jam or a sweet goat milk spread called \"cajeta\".\n\nAmerican and Canadian pancakes (sometimes called \"hotcakes\", \"griddlecakes\", or \"flapjacks\") are usually served at breakfast, in a stack of two or three, topped with real or artificial maple syrup and butter. They are often served with sides such as bacon, toast, eggs or sausage. Other popular topping alternatives include jam, peanut butter, nuts, fruit, honey, powdered sugar, whipped cream, cane syrup, cinnamon and sugar, and molasses. In addition, when a pancake is occasionally served as a dessert, toppings such as ice cream, chocolate syrup, and various fruits are often used.\n\nThe thick batter contains eggs, flour, milk, and a raising agent such as baking powder. The batter can have ingredients such as buttermilk, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, apples, chocolate chips, cheese, or sugar added. Spices such as cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg can also be used. Yogurt may be used to give the pancakes a relatively moist consistency. Pancakes may be ⅓ inch (1 cm) thick and about 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter.\n\n\"Bannock\" is common to virtually all North America's first peoples. The European version (Scotland) was traditionally made of oatmeal. The bannock of Aboriginal people was made of corn, nut meal and plant bulb meal. Each region had its own variation of flour and fruit. Today, bannock is most often deep-fried, pan-fried and oven-baked.\n\n\"Johnnycake\" (also \"jonnycake\", \"johnny cake\", \"journey cake\" or \"Johnny Bread\") is a cornmeal flatbread that was an early American staple food, and is still eaten in the West Indies and Bermuda. The modern johnnycake is stereotypically identified with today's Rhode Island foods, though they are a cultural staple in all of the northern US. A modern johnnycake is fried cornmeal gruel, which is made from yellow or white cornmeal mixed with salt and hot water or milk, and frequently lightly sweetened.\n\n\"Yaniqueques\" or \"yanikeke\" are a Dominican Republic version of the johnnycake. They are a fried bread rather than a pancake, and are a popular beach food.\n\nSourdough was used by prospectors and pioneers to make pancakes without having to buy yeast. Prospectors would carry a pot of sourdough to make pancakes and bread, as it could last indefinitely, needing only flour and water to replenish it. Sourdough pancakes are now a particular specialty in Alaska.\n\nA \"silver dollar pancake\" refers to a pancake about two to three inches (5 to 7 cm) in diameter, or just a bit bigger than the pre-1979 silver dollar coins in the United States. This is usually made by frying a small spoonful of the same batter as any other pancake. One serving usually consists of five to ten silver dollar pancakes.\n\n\"German pancakes\" or \"Dutch baby pancakes\" served in American pancake houses are bowl-shaped. They are eaten with lemons and powdered sugar, jam, or caramelized apples, as well as fritters. A David Eyre's pancake is a variation on the German pancake named for the American writer and editor David W. Eyre (1912–2008).\n\n\"Toutons\" are small, tall pancakes traditional in Newfoundland. They are usually served with dark molasses.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, small pancakes (about 75 mm in diameter) known as \"pikelets\" are also eaten. They are traditionally served with jam or whipped cream, or solely with butter, at afternoon tea, but can also be served at morning tea. They are made with milk, self-raising flour, eggs, and a small amount of icing sugar.\n\nIn some circles in New Zealand, very thin, crêpe-like or English pancake-like pancakes (around in diameter) are served with butter, or butter and lemon, sugar, and then rolled up and eaten.\n\nAmerican-style pancakes are also popular. They are eaten for breakfast or as a dessert, with lemon juice and sugar, butter and maple syrup, stewed fruits such as strawberries and cream, ice cream, or mascarpone.\n\n (), () or () are cassava (manioc) starch flour unleavened pancakes. They are slightly thicker than crêpes and can be eaten plain or with sweet or savoury toppings. Tapioca flour must be moistened and strained through a sieve to become a coarse flour. The heat of an ungreased hot griddle or pan makes the starchy grains fuse into a flatbread which resembles a grainy pancake. Popular toppings include molten butter and dried, shredded coconut.\n\nThe exotic Brazilian pancake () is made from a mixture of coconut milk (, ) and (), a paste extracted from fermented cassava, most prominent in the cuisines of the Northern and Northeastern regions and relatively unknown elsewhere. The resulting product is significantly more watery, filling and strongly flavored than the unfermented , and care should be taken in rolling the pancakes if desired because it breaks very easily. Common toppings include molten butter and common sorts of savoury filling, but creative recipes might arise, such as fake lasagne.\n\nCachapas are corn pancakes, popular in Colombian and Venezuelan cuisine.\n\nIn the US, Mexico and Canada, the franchised restaurant chain International House of Pancakes (IHOP) serves pancakes all day. The Original Pancake House is another chain of pancake restaurants across the US, and Walker Brothers is a series of pancake houses in the Chicago area that developed as a franchised spin-off of The Original Pancake House.\n\nThe popularity of pancakes in Australia has spawned the Pancake Parlour and Pancakes on the Rocks franchised restaurants. In British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, the restaurant chain De Dutch serves Dutch and Flemish-style pannenkoeken.\n\nPancake syndrome is an allergic reaction which some people have after eating pancakes in tropical regions where certain mites can contaminate the flour in pancakes.\n\nPancakes are traditionally eaten on Shrove Tuesday, which is known as \"Pancake Day\" in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia, and \"Pancake Tuesday\" in Ireland and Scotland. (Shrove Tuesday is better known in the United States, France, and other countries as Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday.) Historically, pancakes were made on Shrove Tuesday so that the last of the fat or lard was used up before Lent. No meat products should be eaten during Lent.\n\nCharity and school events are organized on Pancake Day: in a \"pancake race\" each participant carries a pancake in a frying pan. All runners must toss their pancakes as they run and catch them in the frying pan. This event is said to have originated in Olney, England in 1445 when a housewife was still busy frying pancakes to eat before the Lenten fast when she heard the bells of St Peter and St Paul's Church calling her to the Shriving Service. Eager to get to church, she ran out of her house still holding the frying pan complete with pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning, and still wearing her apron and headscarf. Every Shrove Tuesday since 1950, the towns of Olney and Liberal, Kansas have competed in the International Pancake Race. Only local women may compete; they race, and their times are compared to determine the international winner. In Olney the main women's race is augmented by races for local schoolchildren and for men.\n\nThe Rehab UK Parliamentary Pancake Race takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the House of Commons), the upper house (the House of Lords), and the Fourth Estate, contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of the work of the national brain injury charity, Rehab UK, and the needs of people with acquired brain injury.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "75515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75515", "title": "Porridge", "text": "Porridge\n\nPorridge (also historically spelled porage, porrige, parritch) is a food commonly eaten as a breakfast cereal dish, made by boiling ground, crushed or chopped starchy plants—typically grain—in water or milk. It is often cooked or served with added flavorings such as sugar, honey, fruit or syrup to make a sweet cereal or mixed with spices or vegetables to make a savoury dish. It is usually served hot in a bowl.\n\nThe term \"porridge\" is often used specifically for oat porridge, which is eaten for breakfast with salt, sugar, fruit, milk, cream or butter and sometimes other flavorings. Oat porridge is also sold in ready-made or partly cooked form as an instant breakfast.\n\nOther grains used for porridge include rice, wheat, barley, corn, triticale and buckwheat. Many types of porridge have their own names, such as polenta, grits and kasha.\n\nPorridge is a staple food in much of Africa and historically was also a staple in much of Northern Europe and Russia.\n\nPorridge is easy to digest, so it is traditionally used in many cultures as a food for the sick and is often eaten by athletes in training.\n\nThe high nutrition levels in porridge oats have led it to be labelled as a superfood.\n\nPorridge oats, as with many whole-grain cereals, are high in fibre – especially beta-glucan, and are a rich source of vitamins, minerals and antioxidans. In fact, whole oats are one of the few known sources of a unique group of antioxidants called avenanthramides, which are believed to have protective effects against heart disease.\n\nA 2014 study by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a daily intake of at least 3 grams of oat β-glucan lowers total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 5-10% in people with normal or elevated blood cholesterol levels. β-glucan lowers cholesterol by increasing the viscosity of digesta in the small intestine, although cholesterol reduction is greater in those with higher total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in their blood.\n\nPorridge oats are also rich in B Vitamins, which are vital for nervous system and brain function, along with Selenium – an important antioxidant for healthy brain chemistry, DNA repair and is associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer. Ferulic acid, which is also prominent in porridge oats, is also known to be an antioxidant that protects the colon from cancer.\nResearch into the anti-inflammatory effects of porridge oats is ongoing, but there have already been positive indicators that regular consumption could prevent inflammation related to a number of chronic diseases, owing to the high avenanthramide levels.\n\nPorridge is often recommended for weight loss due to its low calorie count – at 171 calories per bowl – and its low glycemic index (GI) means they increase blood sugar levels gradually and over a longer period of time, reducing hunger and the likelihood of eating less healthy snacks.\n\n\n\n\nOats for porridge may be whole (groats), cut into two or three pieces (called \"pinhead\", \"steel-cut\" or \"coarse\" oatmeal), ground into medium or fine oatmeal or steamed and rolled into flakes of varying sizes and thicknesses (called \"rolled oats\", the largest size being \"jumbo\"). The larger the pieces of oat used, the more textured the resulting porridge. It is said that, because of their size and shape, the body breaks steel-cut oats down more slowly than rolled oats, reducing spikes in blood sugar and making the eater feel full longer. The US \"Consumer Reports\" Web site found that the more cooking required, the stronger the oat flavor and the less mushy the texture.\n\nOats are a good source of dietary fibre; health benefits are claimed for oat bran in particular, which is part of the grain.\n\nThe oats are cooked in milk, water or a mixture of the two. Scottish traditionalists allow only oats, water and salt. Traditionally, it is left overnight on a banked-up (barely alight) cooking range or in smouldering fire ashes, possibly due to religious (sabbatarian) restrictions spreading to daily usage. There are techniques suggested by cooks, such as pre-soaking, but a comparative test documented in an article in \"The Guardian\" found very little difference in the end result.\n\nVarious flavorings can be used and can vary widely by taste and locality. Demerara sugar, golden syrup, Greek yoghurt and honey, and even langoustine tails and scallops have been employed for this purpose. A girdle of very cold milk or single cream is believed to be essential by some, traditionally served in a separate bowl to keep it cold. Glaswegians typically use canned evaporated milk and jam. Use of whisky, rum or sherry have been reported. Cooking time can be adjusted to preference, but simmering for ten minutes is typical for non-instant oatmeal. Instant oatmeal, including flavored instant oatmeal, is common and can be prepared with the application of hot water.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, porridge was a staple food in much of Northern Europe, North Korea, and Russia. It was often made from barley, though other grains and yellow peas could be used, depending on local conditions. It was primarily a savoury dish, with meats, root crops, vegetables and herbs added for flavor. Porridge could be cooked in a large metal kettle over hot coals or heated in a cheaper earthenware container by adding hot stones until boiling hot. Until leavened bread and baking ovens became commonplace in Europe, porridge was a typical means of preparing cereal crops for the table.\n\nPorridge was also commonly used as prison food for inmates in the British prison system, and so \"doing porridge\" became a slang term for a sentence in prison.\n\n"}

Iẓnajen; , \"Ṣanhaja\") were once one of the largest North African tribal confederations, along with the Iznaten and Imesmuden confederations. The Sanhaja traced their lineage back to the Himyar who are people of Southern Arabia. Many tribes in Morocco and Mauritania bore and still carry this ethnonym, especially in its Berber form. Other names for the population include \"Zenaga\", \"Sanhája\", \"Znaga\", \"Sanhâdja\" and \"Senhaja\". \n\nAfter the arrival of Islam, the Sanhaja spread out to the borders of the Sudan as far as the Senegal River and the Niger. From the 9th century, Sanhaja tribes were established in the Middle Atlas range, in the Rif Mountains and on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. A part of the Sanhaja, such as the Kutâma, settled in central/eastern Algeria and northern Niger. They played an important part in the rise of the Fatimids. The Sanhaja dynasties of the Zirids and Hammâdids controlled Ifriqiya until the 12th century.\n\nIn the mid-11th century, a group of Sanhaja chieftains returning from the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) invited the theologian Ibn Yasin to preach among their tribes. Ibn Yasin united the tribes in the alliance of the Almoravids in the middle of the 11th century. This confederacy subsequently established Morocco, and conquered western Algeria and Al-Andalus (part of present-day Spain).\n\nThe Znaga or Zenaga tribes would remain in roles as either exploited semi-sedentary agriculturalists and fishermen (Znaga tribes), or, higher up on the social ladder, as religious (Marabout or Zawiya) tribes. Though often Arabized in culture and language, they are believed to be descended from the Zenata or Sanhaja Berber population present in the area before the arrival of the Arab Maqil tribes in the 12th century, which was finally subjected to domination by Arab-descended warrior castes in the 17th century Char Bouba war according to Mercer, the word \"znaga\" is thought to be a distortion of \"Zeneta and Sanhaja\".\n\nThe descendants of the Sanhaja are still found today in the Middle Atlas mountains and eastern Morocco.\n\nThe Zenaga, a group believed to be of Gudala (the southernmost Sanhaja tribe) origin, inhabit southwestern Mauritania and parts of northern Senegal.

China was forced to sign a series of unequal treaties, culminating in the Japanese invasion of China during World War II. The phrase may be considered derogatory, as it mocks Chinese government and the Chinese people for being weak. The phrase was intended as a parallel to \"sick man of Europe\", referring to the weakening Ottoman Empire during the same period. Like the \"sick man of Europe\" term, it has also been used to refer to numerous other Asian countries.\n\nIn 2014 at the Euromoney Philippines Investment Forum 2014, President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines publicly defended his country from being labelled as the new \"sick man of Asia\", citing a Japan External Trade Organization survey that showed \"the Philippines as the second most profitable among ASEAN-5 countries, next to Thailand.\" Reasons for the perceptions Aquino was defending against include its unequal growth and massive poverty, in which from 2000 to 2006 its nominal income grew by 37% while its Gini coefficient only fell by 5%.
