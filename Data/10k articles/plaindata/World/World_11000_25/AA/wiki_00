The first season, comprising ten episodes, premiered on March 24, 2015, on pay-tv Sky Italia channels Sky Atlantic and Sky Cinema 1.\n\nSet in Rome, Milan and different Italian cities, the TV series offers a thrilling story following six people whose lives are intertwined with the rapidly changing political landscape in the early 1990s, during which Italy was gripped by the Clean Hands investigation into political corruption. Subsequently, this led to the end of the \"First Republic\" as well as the termination of several Italian political parties, who created the Italian democratic system after WWII. This controversial period in Italy resulted in the suicide of various political figures.\n\nThe series was followed by \"1993\".\n\nThe series has been compared to \"House of Cards\", \"The Sopranos\", and \"The West Wing\".\n\nIn 1992, prosecutors in Milan launch the \"mani pulite\" investigation into political corruption in Italy. Leonardo Notte (Stefano Accorsi), a slick, self-serving advertising man who believes only in himself, schemes to profit from the unraveling scandal. Caught up in the investigation is Michele Mainaghi (Tommaso Ragno), a Milanese pharmaceutical magnate whose firm sold tainted blood that infected young police officer Luca Pastore (Domenico Diele) with HIV. Pastore, part of Antonio di Pietro's investigative team, seeks revenge and teams up with Rocco Venturi (Alessandro Roja), another cop with a dark side. Meanwhile, Mainaghi's mistress, Veronica Castello (Miriam Leone), seeks out a career in television and returns to Notte after Mainaghi is disgraced. Upstanding Gulf War veteran Pietro Bosco (Guido Caprino) leaps into a fight and saves the life of a man who turns out to be one of the leaders of the new party Lega Nord, quickly finding himself one of the party's parliamentary candidates. Veronica, initially intending to use him boost her TV career, instead falls in love with him; the two begin planning a life together. However, Pietro finds that he has to betray his friends and convictions if he wants to continue his political career and, most of all, build a family with Veronica.\n\n<onlyinclude>\n</onlyinclude>\n\n\nOther characters:\n\nAs of March 24, 2015 \"1992\" was also being broadcast in Austria, United Kingdom, Germany and Ireland.

The country's long and glaciated Atlantic coastline is deeply indented by fjords, rising precipitously to high plateaux.\n\nNorway also includes the Arctic island territories of Svalbard and Jan Mayen.

Norway is the world's third largest oil exporter after Russia and Saudi Arabia and the petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of GDP. It has also rich resources of gas fields, hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals. Norway was the second largest exporter of seafood (in value, after China) in 2006. Other main industries include food processing, shipbuilding, metals, chemicals, mining and pulp and paper products.

{"id": "632986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=632986", "title": "Polish Round Table Agreement", "text": "Polish Round Table Agreement\n\nThe Polish Round Table Talks took place in Warsaw, Poland from 6 February to 5 April 1989. The government initiated the discussion with the banned trade union Solidarność and other opposition groups in an attempt to defuse growing social unrest.\n\nFollowing the factory strikes of the early 1980s and the subsequent formation of the (then still underground) Solidarity movement under the leadership of Lech Wałęsa, the political situation in Poland started relaxing somewhat. Despite an attempt by the government to crack down on trade unionism, the movement had gained too much momentum and it became impossible to hold off change anymore. In addition there was fear of a social explosion due to economic malaise and runaway inflation that had depressed Polish living standards and deepened public anger and frustration. By 1988 the authorities began serious talks with the opposition.\n\nIn September 1988, when a wave of strikes was coming to an end, a secret meeting was held which included Lech Wałęsa and Minister of Internal Affairs Czesław Kiszczak. They agreed on holding the so-called \"Round Table\" talks in the near future to plan out the course of action to be undertaken in the country. The Round Table talks began on 6 February 1989 at 2:23 pm CET. They included the \"solidarity opposition faction\" and the \"coalition government faction\". The talks were held in the Council of Ministers Office. The meetings were co-chaired by Wałęsa and Kiszczak.\n\nThe Polish communists, led by General Jaruzelski, hoped to co-opt prominent opposition leaders into the ruling group without making major changes in the political power structure. In reality, the talks radically altered the shape of the Polish government and society. The events in Poland precipitated and gave momentum to the fall of the entire European communist bloc; the Yalta arrangement collapsed soon after the events in Poland.\n\nThe sessions were divided into three main work groups:\n\nSpecific issues were handled by these work groups, although meetings often ground to a halt. This was caused by a mutual distrust of the factions and an obvious unwillingness of the government faction to relinquish power. The most controversial questions were:\n\nA number of (radical) opposition organisations were quite opposed to the talks as they did not believe in the good intentions of the sitting government. Despite their fears a number of important documents were signed on 5 April, at the conclusion of the sessions. These documents became known as the Round Table Agreement.\n\nAn agreement (\"Round Table Agreement\") was signed on 4 April 1989. The most important demands, including those reflected in the April Novelization, were:\n\nAs a result, real political power was vested in a newly created bicameral legislature and in a president who would be the chief executive. Solidarność became a legitimate and legal political party. Free election to 35% of the seats in Sejm and an entirely free election to the Senate was assured.\n\nThe election of 4 June 1989 brought a landslide victory to Solidarność: 99% of all the seats in the Senate and all of the 35% possible seats in Sejm. Jaruzelski, whose name was the only one the Communist Party allowed on the ballot for the presidency, won by just one vote in the National Assembly. The 65–35 division was soon abolished as well, after the first truly free Sejm elections.\n\nThe Round Table sessions were of momentous importance to the future political developments in Poland. They paved the way to a free and democratic Poland as well as the final abolition of communism in Poland.\n\n\n\nAndrzej Gwiazda, who was one of the leaders of the so-called \"First Solidarity\" (August 1980 – December 1981), claims that the Round Table Agreement and the negotiations that took place before it at a Communist government's Ministry of the Interior and Administration (Poland) conference center (late 1988 and early 1989) in the village of Magdalenka had been arranged by Moscow. According to Gwiazda, who himself did not take part in the negotiations, the Soviets \"carefully selected a group of opposition activists, who passed on as representatives of the whole [Polish] society, and made a deal with them\".\n\nThis notion was supported by Anna Walentynowicz, who in an interview given in 2005 stated that the Agreement was a \"success of the Communists, not of the nation\". According to Walentynowicz, Czesław Kiszczak and Wojciech Jaruzelski, who initiated the negotiations, \"safeguarded their own safety and (...) influence on the government\". Walentynowicz claims that the talks were organized so that in the future, \"no Communist criminal, murderer or thief would pay for their crimes\".\n\nAntoni Macierewicz regards the negotiations and the agreement as a \"classic Soviet plot of the secret services\". In his opinion, both Kiszczak and Jaruzelski were \"at every stage controlled by their Soviet overseers (...) and their autonomy was minimal\". As Macierewicz said in February 2009, the Round Table was a \"tactical success of the parts of the elites, but from the point of view of national interests of Poland, it was a failure\".\n\nPiotr Bączek of Gazeta Polska weekly wrote that in the mid-1980s, the so-called Communist \"Team of three\" (Jerzy Urban, General Władysław Pożoga and Stanisław Ciosek), suggested that among opposition activists, \"search for people, who are politically available\" should be initiated, as \"yesterday's opponent, drawn into the power, becomes a zealous ally\". In June 1987 Mieczysław Rakowski, in a report handed to General Jaruzelski, wrote that a \"change in the attitude towards the opposition must be initiated (...) Maybe, out of numerous oppositional fractions, one movement would be selected and allowed to participate in the governing\", wrote Rakowski. Bączek's opinion is backed by Filip Musiał, a historian of Kraków's office of Institute of National Remembrance. In June 2008 Musiał stated that the \"Team of three\" was ordered to find a solution to a problem, which troubled Communist government of Poland. Economic situation of the country was worsening in the late 1980s, and the threat of social unrest was real. At the same time, the Communists did not want to relinquish power, so they prepared, in Musiał's words, \"a political marketing operation\".\n\nMusiał says that General Czesław Kiszczak himself decided which oppositional activists were \"politically available\" – the condition was that the candidates had to be supportive of \"evolution\" of the system, not its \"radical rejection\". Therefore, most opposition activists, who took part in the negotiations, were those who at different points of their lives were close to the \"Marxist doctrine\" or belonged to the Communist party. Furthermore, all participants were carefully scrutinized by the secret services. As a result, Poland was \"the first Eastern Europe country, in which talks were initiated, but the last, in which completely free elections were organized, in the fall of 1991\". Janusz Korwin-Mikke claims that one of the results of the Round Table agreement was that both sides pledged that \"right-wing parties would never be allowed to rule\", and Jan Olszewski said that \"basic issues had been settled before [the talks], and the negotiations at the Round Table were about secondary matters\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6874024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6874024", "title": "Sales outsourcing", "text": "Sales outsourcing\n\nSales outsourcing is a way for companies to attract increased, high volumes of sales for their products or services by using a third party. The company typically uses outsourcing companies to improve sales volumes without links to the sales teams that carry out those campaigns. The company that undertakes the outsourcing will normally be paid based on the results they are able to generate, and therefore creates a mutually beneficial situation for both client and the outsourcing company. \n\nFull 'sales outsourcing' is observed when companies have an external third party sales force. It is differentiated from value added reselling or distribution in that the business model can be based on shared risk, although there are models where the outsourcer is paid for all of their activity - just as with a hired direct sales force, but the outsourcer provides rapidity, flexibility and experience. \nOther names for sales outsourcing include 'indirect sales' and 'channel sales'.\n\nFull sales outsourcing is different from telemarketing in that it requires direct recruitment of sales personnel with specific backgrounds for each sales campaign. Usually the sales executives will be part of a team that may include telemarketing, marketing, tools systems and methodologies as well as sales management.\n\nSales outsourcing firms provide accountability regarding all sales results and activities while representing the brand of the client. For the end-customer, it usually appears as if the sales team sold the product themselves rather than the sales outsourcing firm. The outsourcing firm is, in essence, an extension of the client but is responsible for all operations associated with direct sales activities, often receiving sales engineering and initial product/service training support from the client.\n\nThe sole purpose of a contract sales organization is to provide sales resource to its clients, without taking title to their products. Sales outsourcing providers include manufacturers' representatives, contract sales organizations, sales agents or sales outsourcing consultants. One way of organising the sales effort, especially when product delivery is erratic, is to replace or supplement internal resources with functionality and expertise brought in from contract sales organisations.\n\nSales outsourcing is quite different from large-scale service outsourcing, which has its advantages but also requires pro-active contract and relationship management. In addition to full sales outsourcing, many partial models are observed, particularly in large firms.\n\nSales outsourcing is expected to be cheaper than the fully loaded cost of employing salespeople, but calculating the cost comparison over time is far from straightforward. Nevertheless, replacing fixed costs with variable costs is attractive to budget-holders. However, unlike many forms of outsourcing, the advantages of sales outsourcing does not often come from saving costs but rather increasing revenue or providing speed of response or flexibility.\n\nThe business case for sales outsourcing should also include consideration of the cost of controlling the contract. Difficulty in measuring the link between sales activity and sales performance leads to a preference for employed salespeople. However, the issues internally are often the same and the internal hire has many other corporate \"distractions\" that do not occur with external resources.\n\nCompanies may also choose sales outsourcing as a means of accessing the best sales skills. Although the pejorative term “rent-a-rep” is still used, there is some evidence that contractors are perceived as good performers against qualitative as well as quantitative performance criteria. Even so, the reputational risk of third parties handling customer relationships has been observed as a factor restricting sales outsourcing. One could argue that an employee is often using a company to gain 2–3 years salary and experience whereas a sales outsourcing firm would usually be looking at a long term contract even though the staff may change during that time. So the aims of an outsourcer can be closely aligned with the aims and objectives of the contracting company.\n\nA recent study has highlighted flexibility as an important driver for outsourcing sales. Uncertain business environments accentuate the need to turn sales resource on and off quickly. Industries and companies undergoing rapid change may need to avoid hiring and firing costs and risks. Contract sales organizations can absorb employment risk, enabling their clients to respond to short-term opportunities or competitor activity (see Lean startup). However, an outsourcer may build in more of a premium to the rate or commission if excessive flexibility is required on a contract.\n\nContract sales organizations are growing in volume and influence, able to provide both tactical activity and long-term strategic support to their clients.\n\nSpeed of response is seen as a key reason to use an outsourcer. If a company was looking to enter a market it may take several months to recruit the local manager which then takes several months to find an office and build a team. With an outsourcer, a full working team can oftentimes be operational within a matter of days or weeks.\n\nSales outsourcing can also be used as a market entry strategy and avoids permanent establishment risk.\n\nThe experience of many organizations over the past several years demonstrates that indirect channels can be critical to expanding market coverage. This has been particularly true in the electronics, communications and high tech sectors. For example, the indirect channel now accounts for 66 percent of overall technology sales, up from 53 percent in 1997.\n\nSome examples of communications companies who employ indirect sales forces to their internal sales efforts include: AireSpring, AT&T, Comcast, Earthlink Business, Integra Telecom, Level 3 Communications, Time Warner Cable, TelePacific, tw telecom, XO Communications, and Windstream. Some top sales agencies who sell voice and data services for these carriers include Telarus, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, Intelisys, based in Petaluma, California, and Telecom Brokerage Inc (TBI), based in Chicago, Illinois.\n"}
