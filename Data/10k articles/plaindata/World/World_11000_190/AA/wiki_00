There was also the dwarf elephant of Cyprus (\"Palaeoloxodon cypriotes\"), Sicily-Malta (\"Palaeoloxodon falconeri\") and mainland Europe (\"Palaeoloxodon antiquus\"). However, these became extinct several thousand years ago, and subsequently the presence of elephants in Europe was only due to importation of these animals.\n\nEuropeans first came in contact with live elephants in 327 BC, when Alexander the Great descended into India from the Hindu Kush, but Alexander was quick to adopt them. Four elephants guarded his tent, and shortly after his death his associate Ptolemy issued coins showing Alexander in the elephant headdress that became a royal emblem also in the Hellenized East. Aristotle depended on first-hand information for his account of elephants, but like most Westerners he believed the animals live for two hundred years. Roman scouts in the royal Syrian parks shortly before the last of the Seleucids fell to Rome had orders to hamstring every elephant they could capture, and while elephants performed in the circuses of Rome, Shapur's war elephants in the mid-4th century numbered in the hundreds (Fox 1973 p 338).\n\nElephants largely disappeared from Europe after the Roman Empire. As exotic and expensive animals, they were exchanged as presents between European rulers, who exhibited them as luxury pets, beginning with Harun ar-Rashid's gift of an elephant to Charlemagne.\nHistorical accounts of elephants in Europe include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
