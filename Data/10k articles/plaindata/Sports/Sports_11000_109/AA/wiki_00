{"id": "7166058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7166058", "title": "CC Amfi", "text": "CC Amfi\n\nCC Amfi, also known as Nordlyshallen (\"The Northern Light Hall\") is an indoor sports arena in Hamar, Norway. It is mostly used for ice hockey and is the home arena of Storhamar Hockey. It has also been used for short track speed skating, figure skating, handball, events and concerts. The venue has a capacity for 7,000 spectators and was built for the 1994 Winter Olympics, where it was used for short track speed skating and figure skating. Other major events held at the arena include the 1999 IIHF World Championship in ice hockey, the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship, the 2012 IPC Ice Sledge Hockey World Championships and the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.\n\nConstruction of CC Amfi started in August 1991 and it was inaugurated on 25 November 1992, with construction costing 83 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The venues are owned by Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, a subsidiary of Hamar Municipality.\n\nIn the unsuccessful Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics, ice hockey events were proposed played in Hamar and Gjøvik. However, in the Lillehammer bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, all ice events were moved to Lillehammer proper, after recommendations from the International Ice Hockey Federation, who wanted all the ice hockey events to take place in the same town. This would involve building two temporary ice rinks at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, and after the Olympics moving them to Gjøvik and either Moelv, Brumunddal or Kongsvinger. By 1989, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to include short-track speed skating, increasing the number of ice halls from two to three. In April, the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) therefore proposed building permanent ice rinks in Hamar and Gjøvik.\n\nThe IOC also required that the long-track speed skating be done indoors. Hamar was awarded the venue, Vikingskipet, after Hamar Municipality guaranteed to cover all costs exceeding NOK 200 million. This provided sufficient leverage for Hamar to host additional events. LOOC approved the construction of Vikingskipet in on 15 December 1989 and at the same time supported proposals to renovate Storhamar Ishall to host Olympic ice hockey matches. A second, temporary training rink was also planned built in Hamar. In addition, the Hamar venue would be used for short track speed skating, while figure skating would be run in Lillehammer. In March, the plans were changed, so Hamar would receive an all-new ice rink in addition to a renovation of Storhamar Ishall.\n\nFinancing of the venue was officially granted by the Parliament of Norway in April 1990. The International Skating Union wanted to locate all skating in Hamar, and in October 1990, LOOC confirmed that they would reallocate the events so that all the all skating events would take place in Hamar, and that a separate Olympic Village would be built in Hamar for skaters. The original plans for the Olympic Amphitheatre called for a capacity for 4,500 and construction to cost NOK 65. By June 1991, LOOC decided to increase the size of the venue, as IOC would only allow the venue host figure skating if its spectator capacity was raised to 6,000. Financing of the expansion was granted in August, with the cost rising to NOK 83.3 million. Early plans called for the venue to be built in concrete, but a research project coordinated by the Norwegian Institute of Technology made it possible to cover the venue's exterior and interior in wood panel. This solution was hailed as aesthetical by architects, and as a technical innovation by the Norwegian construction industry.\n\nThe contract to build the venue was awarded to Martin M. Bakken, a local contractor, and construction started in August 1991. The laminated wood beams for the roof were delivered by Moelven Industrier.\nIce was laid on the on 12 November 1992 and the arena was officially completed on 1 December. The opening show took place already on 25 November and the first official match, between Storhamar and Stjernen, took place on 8 December. The venue was the 26th indoor ice hockey arena in Norway. After the Olympic arena was built, Storhamar Ishall was renovated, and the spectator capacity reduced through the construction of storage facilities and VIP areas. The Olympic Amphitheatre later installed Norway's first media cube in 2004.\n\nThe arena was formerly known as Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre ( or ) until October 2015, when CC bought the naming rights for the arena. A new media cube was also installed as part of the deal.\n\nAdjacent to the Olympic venue lays Storhamar Ishall. Solely used for ice hockey, it opened in 1981 and has a capacity for 1,200. Since the opening of the Olympic venue, Storhamar Ishall has been used for training, and the two rinks share common dressing rooms and other facilities.\n\nThe sport of ice hockey was taken up by Storhamar IL after the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo spurred the public interest in the sport. The pitch used by the club for summer sports was iced for the winter and surrounded with tall wooden boards. As the club established an ice hockey section in 1955 it received funding from the Norwegian Ice Hockey Federation to purchase tall boards. The pitch was renovated for NOK 4,000 in 1957, financed through a municipal grant. Among the upgrades was insulation of the club house, which was a barracks stemming from the Second World War. A contractor who had a storage facility close by, kept receiving visits from juveniles who jumped the fence and took material for the work. He eventually visited the club house and supplied them with a key to the facility, somewhat involuntarily becoming the club's first sponsor.\n\nStorhamar traditionally played ice hockey on natural ice. In 1977, the club was promoted to the First Division, where the regulations required that the team play on artificial ice. To avoid having to play all their games on the road, the municipality agreed to finance an outdoor artificial rink at Storhamar. With the increased attendance and interest for hockey following the town's team playing in the top league, Storhamar started planning an indoor venue.\n\nState grants and a municipal guarantee were secured in 1980, with construction starting in the fall. The arena was built around the existing artificial rink. Because the hall could not be completed in time for the 1980–81 season, Storhamar was permitted to play the season in the Second Division. Storhamar Ishall became the 11th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway when it opened in August 1981. The venue was to be partially financed through renting it out during the summer, including to an annual town fair. These ideas fell through and the municipality was forced to take over the venue.\n\nThe twin areas are located at Storhamar, a residential area west of the town center of Hamar. Similar to Vikingskipet, the venue has two official names, Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre and Nordlyshallen. The former cannot be used commercially by non-Olympic events, such as in merchandise. The venue is owned by the municipally owned entity called Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, which also owns and operates Vikingskipet. The operating deficits are covered by a post-Olympic capital fund, which in the case of the two Hamar venues was NOK 60 million. Only the interest of these funds is used to operate the facilities, unlike Lillehammer and Gjøvik which also derive fundings from their base capital. Owing to the fund, Hamar Municipality does not need to give municipal grants to operate the facilities.\n\nHamar Olympic Amphitheatre is oval and has wood as the main construction material, both for the interior and the exterior. Overall it is long, wide and tall. Architect Ola Mowè of HRTB chose the shape to connect various spatial designs and types of buildings in the neighborhood. The dark color was chosen to counteract the otherwise lively array of colors in the surroundings. The roof was built using laminated wood lattice girders. The longest beam span is . The exterior walls are clad with boards, panels and decorative molding. The interior wall are covered with pine panel.\n\nThe surface area of the building is , of which is on the ground floor. When used for ice hockey, the venue has an official spectator capacity for 7,000. When used for handball the capacity is 6,480. Storhamar Ishall has standing-only capacity for 1,500 spectators. During the Olympics, the main hall had 330 VIP seats, 60 seats for commentators and 200 press seats. The main rink had a new media cube installed in 2016.\n\nDuring the 1994 Winter Olympics, Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre was used for figure skating and short track speed skating. It hosted 13 events, drawing an average of 5,554 spectators. Storhamar Ishall was used for warming up and training to these events.\n\nShort track speed skating was dominated by South Korea, who won four of the six events. Chae Ji-Hoon won the men's 500 meters and Kim Ki-Hoon the 1000 meters, while the men's 5000 meter relay was won by Italy. Cathy Turner defended her 1992 gold on the 500 meters, while Chun Lee-Kyung won the women's 1000 meters and South Korea won the 3000 meter relay. At 13, Kim Yoon-Mi became the world's youngest Olympic gold medalist.\n\nIn figure skating, relaxation of the amateurism rules led to several former stars returning. The ladies' singles has resulted in the as-yet highest United States Winter Olympic television viewership, thanks to Tonya Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly hiring Shane Stant to club fellow female figure skater Nancy Kerrigan in the knee. The ladies' singles was won by Ukraine's Oksana Baiul, while the men's singles was won by Russia's Alexei Urmanov, the ice dancing was won by Russians Oksana Grishuk and Evgeny Platov and the pair skating was won by Russians Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov.\n\nThe Olympic Amphitheatre is the home venue of Storhamar Hockey, formerly known as the Storhamar Dragons, the ice hockey division of Storhamar IL. The clubs' youth groups train in Storhamar Ishall, which is also used by the club's bandy group. The Dragons have played continuously in the Elite League since the 1982–83 season. Their highest average league attendance was in the 1994–95 season, when they drew 3,731 spectators. While playing in Storhamar Ishall, the highest average attendance was in the 1984–85 season, with 2,097 spectators. From the 1991–92 to the following season, when the Olympic venue opened, the Dragons' average attendance doubled, from 1,412 to 2,875. The Dragons' best attendance is 7,405, set during game seven of the 2004–05 Playoffs, where the Dragons beat Vålerenga in overtime.\nAfter the opening of Storhamar Ishall, it was used for two Norway men's national ice hockey team matches. On 2 January 1982, Norway lost 3–5 against Romania; and on 13 September 1983, Norway beat Italy 4–2. The venue hosted, along with Lillehammer, Group A of the 1992 IIHF European U18 Championship. Norway's senior inaugural international match at the Olympic arena saw Norway lose 4–6 against Canada on 9 February 1993. The 1999 IIHF World Championship in ice hockey was hosted at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, Håkons Hall in Lillehammer and Jordal Amfi in Oslo. Fourteen group-stage matches were held in Hamar.\n\nOn March 12, 2017 Storhamar hosted the Sparta Warriors in game five of the quarter finals in the Elite league. The game lasted for 217 minutes and 14 seconds in what is believed to be the longest hockey game in history. Joakim Jensen scored the game-winning goal as Storhamar won 2-1 after nearly 11 periods of play.\n\nIn the film, \"I, Tonya\", the scenes which take place in CC Amfi have not been shot in Hamar, but in the Macon Coliseum in Georgia.\n\nStorhamar Ishall is the regular training venue for Storhamar IL's figure skating group. Between them, the two venues have hosted the Norwegian Figure Skating Championships three times: Storhamar Ishall in 1983, and the Olympic Amphitheatre in 2005 and 2011. In October 1993, the Olympic Amphitheatre hosted Piruetten 1993, a pre-Olympic figure skating event. Although featuring stars such as Nancy Kerrigan, it only attracted 150 spectators. The venue has hosted the ISU Junior Grand Prix in 1999–2000 and 2000–01 and the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in 2002.\n\nStorhamar Ishall hosted Norway's first international short track speed skating event in November 1991. The 1995 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships were scheduled to take place at the arena, but were moved to Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall because the Hamar venue would be used by Storhamar Dragons for the play-offs. The Olympic Amphitheatre has hosted matches of the Norway men's national handball team, with the first tournament being played in January 1993. It has also been used for Norway women's national handball team matches. The venue was one of seven venues used for the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship. Between 2 and 9 December, it hosted nine group-stage matches and three of the quarter-finals. The venue was also the site of two matches during Møbelringen Cup 2006. In September 2007, the Olympic arena hosted Fédération Cynologique Internationale's world championship in dog agility. The 2012 IPC Ice Sledge Hockey World Championships took place at the Olympic Amphitheatre. Lillehammer hosted the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, with Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre being the venue for the figure skating events.\n\nSince 2001, Hamar Olympic Amphitreatre has hosted the annual Idrettsgallaen, a television show that honors the past year's Norwegian sports and athlete achievements. Hamar was selected to host the event because its main sponsor, the national lottery company Norsk Tipping, has its head office in Hamar. Idrettsgallaen is held in early January, when many of winter sports athletes are home and the summer athletes are off season. In 2010, Idrettsgallaen was hosted in Lillehammer because the weekend crashed with the 2010 European Speed Skating Championships in Vikingskipet and Hamar lacks sufficient hotel capacity to host both simultaneously. Concerts hosted at the arena since the opening concert with Fats Domino on 25 November 1992 include Little Richard in 1993, Vamp in 2005, Willie Nelson in 2008 and José Carreras in 2010.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27351266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27351266", "title": "Cricket (musical)", "text": "Cricket (musical)\n\nCricket, also called Cricket (Hearts and Wickets), is a short musical written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. It was commissioned for Queen Elizabeth's 60th birthday celebration, and was first performed at Windsor Castle on 18 June 1986.\n\nSeveral of the tunes from the show were later used for \"Aspects of Love\", so the work was dropped from public performance or recording. \"Cricket\" was the last original musical Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote together.\n\nAfter their collaboration on \"Evita\" in 1978, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Tim Rice took what was originally intended to be a temporary break from their illustrious theatrical partnership. They did not work together again until the request for this \"pièce d'occasion\" came up, and \"Cricket\" ended up being their final original musical.\n\nPrince Edward, the Queen's youngest son, commissioned a short musical from Lloyd Webber and Rice for his mother's 60th birthday celebration. The game of cricket was Tim Rice's favourite pastime – he had a cricket field on the grounds of his home and had his own cricket team – and Rice had a particular passion for this new comic musical about England's national sport. Rice used actual cricket-related names for his characters, boosting the light-hearted feeling of the piece. He and Lloyd Webber created a 25-minute tongue-in-cheek \"musicalette\" for the Queen.\n\n\"Cricket\" is entirely sung-through, with no spoken dialogue.\n\nSet against the backdrop of the semi-fictional Headingley Cricket Club's matches, the comic and slightly melodramatic plot of \"Cricket\" has star player Donald torn between his team and his girlfriend Emma – as she decides to abandon watching cricket for what appears to be a far more exciting life at the race track with the caddish Vincent.\n\nThe leads in the cast are Donald, Emma, Emma's father, Vincent, and a West Indian fast-bowler from the opposing team named Winston B. Packer. The musical's chorus are the rest of the cricket players.\n\nThe show begins during a match of Headingley Cricket Club. The game is watched by the Earl of Headingley, his daughter Emma Kirkstall-Lane, and Vincent St. Leger. The Earl and the cricketers sing the praises of cricket. (\"The Summer Game\")\n\nEmma intends to marry Headingley player Donald Hobbs. And at the moment, even though he is Emma's father, the Earl is more approving of Donald than of Emma, because he feels his daughter is not supportive enough of Donald's cricketing. Emma loves Donald, but she thinks he neglects her somewhat for his cricket playing, and she wants more time together. She feels that she will be forever secondary in Donald's eyes until he retires from cricket. (\"As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By\")\n\nVincent, who is devoted to horse races, overhears Emma, and offers his own rather self-interested solution: leaving for the races in lieu of the cricket match. Emma is reluctant at first, but decides that maybe Vincent is right, and runs off with him. (\"The Sport of Kings\") The opposing team's fast bowler, Winston B. Packer, sings about how wonderful it is to be able to hit batsmen when they miss – and he injures several batsmen during the course of the song. (\"The Art of Bowling\")\n\nWhile Donald is batting, he sees Emma leave with Vincent. He's hurt and truly torn – does he stay and bat to help his team win and lose Emma, or does he leave and try to get her back? In the end, sportsmanship prevails: Donald cannot let his team down. But he has been hit a few times during the song, and is suddenly levelled. As he lies dazed on the ground, lines from various people and various moments of the game bombard him – Winston, Emma, Vincent, his team. (\"All I Ask of Life\")\n\nDuring the tea interval, Emma returns, dejected, feeling Vincent has deceived her. Not only has she lost all of her money, but she has lost Donald as well. She blames herself, and doesn't see how anyone will ever love her again. (\"Fools Like Me\")\n\nDonald and the cricketers return to the game after the interval, but Donald ignores Emma. The Earl, however, lets fly at Emma and Vincent. Because of Emma's gambling debts, the Earl has lost his reputation and is in financial distress. Vincent tries to speak, but the Earl turns his attention, and wrath, onto him. The Earl is a powerful member of the Jockey Club, and bans Vincent from all racing events for life. Vincent turns to Emma for sympathy, but she accuses him of deceiving her and getting her into trouble with her father. (\"A Ban for Life\")\n\nVincent and Emma's conversation is cut off by a scream. Wittering has been injured and can no longer continue in the game. Headingley CC needs 10 more runs to win, but there is no one to take Wittering's place alongside Donald. The Earl laments the bad day for Headingley. (\"Wittering's Final Innings\") Vincent suddenly speaks up and says he will take Wittering's place. (\"The Making of St. Leger\") He joins Donald and the game continues – to the amazement of the cricketers, who believed Vincent had no redeeming qualities. Vincent is beaten up badly during the game, but keeps playing.\n\nDonald's and Vincent's scores win the game and they are both proclaimed heroes. The Earl is so impressed by Vincent's bravery (and recovery of a vital match!) that he withdraws the horse-racing ban. And Donald tells Emma he will play less cricket and spend more time with her. She wonders, could they go to the horse races? Vincent says he will spend Sundays playing cricket. Winston vows to try slow bowling. And to top it all off, Wittering is feeling better. (\"The Final Stand\")\n\nDonald and Emma finish making up, and vow to stay together with a sweeping love ballad which ends in a crescendo that everyone joins into, proclaiming the triumph of the cricket metaphor for life and love. (\"One Hot Afternoon\")\n\n\nThe show debuted as planned on 18 June 1986 at Windsor Castle, directed by Trevor Nunn and starring Ian Charleson, Sarah Payne, and John Savident. The musicians were members of Colosseum II and others – the ensemble that had first performed Lloyd Webber's \"Variations\". The men's vocal group Cantabile played the cricketers' chorus.\n\nThe Windsor Castle performance was quite spirited and amusing, and was very well received. Two more performances followed. One was at Lloyd Webber's Sydmonton Festival on 15 July 1986. The last performance was in November 1986 at Tim Rice's favourite charity, the Lord's Taverners Ball, where Rice played the cricketer Wittering, dressed in his own Heartaches Cricket Club uniform.\n\nA segment of the original rehearsals of \"Cricket\" was televised on the Andrew Lloyd Webber instalment of \"The South Bank Show\", which aired on 15 November 1986. The segment featured Sarah Payne and Alvin Stardust rehearsing \"As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By\" and \"The Sport of Kings\".\n\nThere have been no further performances of the musical.\n\n\nLloyd Webber used at least five of the tunes from \"Cricket\" in his musical \"Aspects of Love\" (1989). This meant that \"Cricket\", which had been extremely well received, was a dead item, a fact that greatly distressed Tim Rice. The piece could thus never be expanded into a full theatrical musical. Lloyd Webber used other tunes from \"Cricket\" in \"Sunset Boulevard\".\n\nThe \"Cricket\" libretto was published in \"'A Breathless Hush ...': The MCC Anthology of Cricket Verse\" (2004). \"Cricket\" has not been recorded for commercial release, although a non-commercial instrumental demo studio album was recorded on solo piano in 1986. The performance rights for the piece have not yet been made available.\n\nThe men's vocal group Cantabile recorded \"The Summer Game\", featuring Tim Rice singing as the Earl, on their 2011 CD \"Songs of Cricket\".\n"}

{"id": "40513064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40513064", "title": "Gannochy Trust", "text": "Gannochy Trust\n\nThe Gannochy trust is a Scottish charity with a preference for projects in Perth and Kinross. The trust was founded in 1937 by influential Perth business man Arthur Kinmond Bell, known as A. K. Bell, of Arthur Bell & Sons Ltd.\n\nThe Gannochy Trust was founded in 1937, by the established whisky distiller and philanthropist A. K. Bell. The founding aims of the project were to maintain the Gannochy Housing estate, built by A. K. Bell, and to continue to improve Perth and the surrounding area for the local citizens into the future. Initially this was funded from shares in Bell's Whisky, gifted to the trust by their founder.\n\nThe Trust funds many activities in Scotland, with a preference for Perth and Kinross, through awarding grants to what it feels are worthwhile causes. It has four over-arching themes with grant applications expected to meet at least one of the following aims, although the third and fourth will only be accepted for projects within Perth and Kinross:\n\n\nThe Gannochy trust particularly provides many grants for the improvement of sports provision and participation.\n\nIn line with the original Trust Deed, the trust also manages and rents property in the Gannochy area of Perth. This includes an estate of rented homes, a mixture of general and sheltered housing, as well as a small number of farms. The trust also manage the nearby Doo'cot Cricket Park, and Quarrymill park, as places for community recreation.\n\nTo help meet the goals stated above, the Trust has helped form a number of charitable partnerships, often in conjunction with Perth and Kinross Council, to help it distribute funds to where they are needed while maintaining its charitable status. \n\nThe first such partnership was Bell’s Sports Centre (Perth) Ltd set up to run the sports centre built by the Trust. Now known as Live Active Leisure Ltd, this body has grown to include many recreational venues across the county.\n\nA later partnership was the Perth and Kinross Countryside Trust, which helps maintain the rural walkways and other amenities meeting the objectives of caring for the natural environment.\n\nAnother such partnership is the Perth and Kinross Heritage Trust, which conserves the archaeological and architectural heritage of Perth.\n\nIn line with A K Bell's intentions, the Gannochy Trust has played a large role in the development of modern day Perth, and it has been noted that many of the landmarks visible to visitors today are a result of the support of the Trust.\n\nOne of the first major projects for the trust was the construction of the Bell's Sports Center in Perth, announced in December 1964 and construction starting in March 1967 with the Gannochy Trust providing £225,000 towards the costs of construction. The center opened in 1968. They also provided funding for refurbishments and extensions in 1972 and 1982, with the newly extended center being renamed the Gannochy Sports Complex, although the Bell's Sports Center is still the most commonly used name for the complex.\n\nThe Trust has also supported the Perth Theatre and recently helped secure £14.5 million in funding for a two-year refurbishment project. This project was scheduled to start in the summer of 2014 and is expected to be completed by spring 2017 with the intention of restoring and extending the Edwardian building to better serve the city.\n\nIn 1994 it was announced that Perth's a new multi-million pound library would be named the A K Bell Library. This was both in recognition of the fact that the Gannochy Trust was a major contributor to this project, as well as the large role they, and their founder A K Bell, have made to the City since its foundation. The library was formally opened in 1995.\n\nIn 1967, as part of the construction of Stirling University, the Gannochy Trust provided up to £100,000 towards a sports pavilion on the campus. They have continued to support sport at the university, including funding sports bursaries in 1983, and contributing £500,000 to the Scottish National Tennis Centre in 1989.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2010, The Gannochy Trust sponsored the Gannochy Trust Innovation Award, awarded in by the Royal Society of Edinburgh. This highly prestigious award was awarded to an individual in Scotland under the age of 45 in recognition of outstanding achievement which had resulted in a major economic or social benefit to Scotland or the wider world. This award consisted of a gold medal and £50,000 to develop the idea, and it is believed the £600,000 awarded has created £4 million of additional value to the Scottish economy.\n\n\n"}

Originally, Crosby Park in Albion was planned to be the new ground for the Royals, but was rejected by the Brisbane City Council. In 1964, the club was approved to break ground for a stadium at Spencer Park in Newmarket. On 10 May 1964, the ground was officially named Holloway Field after the Windsor foundation and life member, Stan Holloway.

Floodlighting was added on 24 September 1982 and a sprinkler system two years later. It is currently the training camp of the Netherlands national baseball team and has hosted a variety of international baseball matches, including the World Master Games. It is the home ground of the Queensland Rams for Claxton Shield games and the newly formed Australian Baseball League.\n\nWith the arrival of the Brisbane Bandits for the 2013-14 season also came upgrades to the ballpark. A new brick backstop, new backstop netting, seating added to the tiered grandstands as well as a refurbished infield. A progressive replacement plan for the lighting towers was implemented to bring Holloway Field up to the highest standard for night games. After the completion of the Major League Baseball Opening Series at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2014, the foul poles that were fabricated for the event were relocated to Brisbane and erected at Holloway Field prior to the 2014–15 Australian Baseball League season.\n"}
{"id": "2591218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2591218", "title": "Interchange (Australian rules football)", "text": "Interchange (Australian rules football)\n\nInterchange (or, colloquially, the bench or interchange bench) is a team position in Australian rules football, consisting of players who are part of the selected team but are not currently on the field of play.\n\nAs of the 2016 season, at AFL level, each team is permitted four interchange players, and a maximum of ninety total player interchanges during a game. Players have no limit to the number of times they may individually be changed, and an interchange can occur at any time during the game, including during gameplay.\n\nThe four players named on the interchange bench in the teamsheet, which is submitted ninety minutes before the commencement of the game, must be the four interchange players who start on the bench, however they may be substituted immediately if the coach wishes.\n\nInterchange rules are not uniform across all leagues. In the major state leagues, as of 2016, following interchange numbers are permitted:\n\n\nIn AFL Women's, in which each side has 16 players on the field instead of the 18 of the men's game, five interchange players are allowed, with no limit on the number of rotations. The AFL, which operates the women's league, decided not to impose a limit on the number of rotations, as that league is contested during the main AFL's offseason in the southern summer.\n\nRepresentative teams (such as State of Origin teams), practice and exhibition matches often feature an extended interchange bench of up to six or eight players.\n\nAt different times during the history of the sport, there have been \"substitute\" players (also known as \"reserves\") serving a function distinct from interchange players. A player who begins the game as a substitute may take no part in the game until he is substituted for another player, the latter of whom permanently leaves the field.\n\nThe substitute rule was resisted for many years, with the prevailing view in the 1910s and 1920s being that a team should be permitted only to substitute a player in the event of an injury, but that there was no way to rule against a team making a tactical substitution. A single substitute was finally introduced by the Australian National Football Council for the 1930 season, with no restrictions on whether the substitution be used for injury or tactical reasons. A second substitute was introduced in 1946, before the substitutes were replaced by interchange in the 1970s. Additionally, in the AFL between 2011 and 2015, a hybrid interchange–substitution arrangement existed in which there were three interchange players and one substitute; under those rules, the substitute was required to wear a green vest until activated, and the player substituted out of the game donned a red vest. As of 2016, substitution is no longer used in the sport.\n\nIn front of the interchange benches is the \"interchange area\" (sometimes called the \"interchange gate\"), which is a 15-metre stretch of the boundary line, roughly centred between the two teams' benches, through which all players must enter and exit the ground when being interchanged. It is marked on the boundary line with two short lines, perpendicular to the boundary, and sometimes with a slanted end. A player who interchanges outside of this area is not permitted to return for the rest of the game.\n\nWhere a player leaves the ground on a stretcher, he is permitted to take the most direct route to the changerooms for medical treatment, and is still permitted to return later in the game; however, where he leaves on a stretcher, the player must wait for 20 minutes of playing time (the length of one regulation quarter) before returning. If a stretcher is brought onto the ground but the player ultimately does not need to use it, he must still wait for 20 minutes before returning.\n\nDue to new AFL concussion rules, effective from 2011 onwards, any player suspected of suffering a concussion must come off the ground and undergo a concussion test; if found to be concussed, he is not allowed to return to the field for the remainder of the game.\n\nA player may be forced to make an interchange by the umpire under the blood rule. If an umpire sees a player bleeding, he will call time-on at the next appropriate time, stopping play until the player has left the field and been replaced.\n\nWhere the league has a provision to do so, an interchange steward is provided to monitor interchanges.\n\nThe primary means for controlling interchanges in most leagues (but not in the AFL) is via a Head Count, currently detailed in Law 5.5 of the game. To initiate this procedure, a team captain must request a head count from the umpire. The umpire, at the opportunity, will call time on, and all players from both teams line will line-up in the centre of the ground to be counted by the umpires.\n\nIf either team has more players on the ground than it should, the general rule is that the team's entire score to that point of the game is cancelled (unless the offending team's score was zero at the time of the head count), and a free kick and 50-metre penalty are paid to the opposing captain from the centre of the ground or the spot of the ball. Not all leagues automatically impose a cancellation of the score; in some cases – including the modern day Victorian Football League – the progress score at the time of the head count is recorded, and league officials meet after the game to assess whether or not to retrospectively cancel the score.\n\nIf both teams have the correct number of players, a free kick and 50-metre penalty are paid against the captain who initiated the head count; that captain may also be reported for time-wasting and ordered off (should the rules of the league permit) if the umpire believes the captain's primary reason for calling the head count was to waste time.\n\nHead counts are rare at the top levels of the sport, but occur from time to time at suburban, country and junior levels.\n\nThe most famous head-count request occurred in the SANFL in Round 15, 1975. West Torrens' champion Fred Bills, playing the last of his 313 league games (having announced his retirement earlier that week) entered the field of play before John Cassin, who was injured and lying on a stretcher, had left it. This prompted West Adelaide, trailing 11.7 (73) to 12.10 (82) in the final quarter, to request a head count. West Torrens players ran for the boundary line, while West Adelaide players wrestled with them to keep them in bounds; in the chaos, one player, identified in the match report published in \"The Advertiser\" as Norm Dare, managed to leap the fence and hide under a supporter's coat to avoid detection from the umpire. Ultimately, the count was abandoned when it became impossible to vouch for who was on the field at the time of the request, and West Torrens went on to win by three goals. The incident was celebrated as one of the sport's 150 greatest moments in the 150th year celebrations in 2008.\n\nThe other most famous head count occurred during the Grand Final of the 2018 North East Australian Football League season between Southport and Sydney reserves. Southport was leading by ten goals at three-quarter time, but accidentally sent nineteen men onto the field to start the final quarter; Sydney called for a head count twenty seconds later, and Southport's extra man was discovered. Sydney received a free kick and fifty metre penalty, but NEAFL officials decided not to annul Southport's score, citing a provision within the laws of the game which allowed the full penalty not to be applied if the breach had no material impact on the game. Southport went on to win the game by 55 points.\n\nThere have been only three head counts, all unsuccessful, in the history of the VFL/AFL:\n\nNotable successful head counts around the country which resulted in the cancellation of a team's score are listed in the table below.\nIn Round 6, 2008, and played a controversial drawn match, in which a bungled interchange late in the game left Sydney with 19 men on the field for about a minute, during which time the Swans scored the game-tying behind. Although the AFL's laws allowed for each of the Sydney players to be fined $2500 for the error, there could be no change to the match result because North Melbourne had not called for a head count.\n\nThis highlighted the impracticality of the head count rule, which had existed since the days before interchanges or substitutions were allowed, with a modern professional league with its rapid use of interchanges for fatigue management.\n\nA few weeks after this incident, the AFL introduced a new rule allowing the interchange steward to inform the umpires of interchange errors: specifically, when a player enters the field before the player he is replacing has left the field, or when a player is interchanged without using the interchange gate.\n\nIn each case, the penalty is a free kick in the centre of the ground or at the spot of the ball at the time, whichever is the greater penalty against the offending team. If the offending team is not in possession of the ball, the umpire shall impose an additional 50-metre penalty against them.\n\nin the case of a player not using the interchange gate, this penalty replaces the previous rule that the player would not be permitted to return.\n\nAny score or free kicks given to the opposition when an interchange infringement has occurred are cancelled.\n\nThis process is seen only at the professional AFL level; lower levels of the sport still rely on the head count rule to police interchanges. AFL captains retain the right to call for a head count if they believe an interchange infringement has not been detected by the interchange steward, but this has not yet been exercised under the new rules.\n\nThe number of interchanges allowed has followed the following time-line under Australian National Football Council (ANFC) rules:\n\nFollowing the disbandment of the ANFC, the following timeline indicates changes to interchange rules in the AFL. Other leagues have not followed this timeline:\n\nHistorically, the interchange bench was used sparingly, and mostly to take poor-performing or players who were injured and unable to continue out of the game. There was a marked change in this at the top level as professionalism grew in the sport between 2000–2010, and the interchange bench began to be used much more frequently as a means of rotating players to manage player fatigue through the game and offer rest periods for hard working players and game time for young/old players. The average number of interchanges in the AFL doubled between 2007 (56 changes per team per game) and 2010 (113 changes per team per game) as coaches sought to give frequent rests to their running players.\n"}

As of the 2015–16 season, Piráti Chomutov plays in the top-level Czech Extraliga. Their home arena is the SD aréna located in Chomutov, Czech Republic\n\nThe club was established in 1945 as ČSK Chomutov.\n\nIn the 1950/1951 season, playing as Sokol Hutě, the team was promoted to the Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League, where they played until the 1963/1964 season.\n\nIn 1967, as VTŽ Chomutov, the team was promoted to the highest league again but was relegated the very next year. In 1984 the club was demoted to the third level of hockey in Czechoslovak hockey, the Second National Hockey League.\n\nIn 1997, as KLH Chomutov, the club bought the license in the First National Hockey League (FNHL) from HC Slovan Ústečtí Lvi.\n\nAfter winning the league in the 2011–12 FNHL season, Piráti Chomutov returned to the top-level league Czech Extraliga. During the play-outs in the 2013-14 season Piráti Chomutov lost and returned to the First National Hockey League. Season 2014/2015 in FNHL was one of the most successful in history. Pirati Chomutov became a winner and after play off returned to the top-level league (season 2015/2016).\n\nOn 24 November 1956, while the team was operating under the name TJ Baník Chomutov ZJF, some members of the team were involved in a fatal airplane accident. A Czechoslovak Airlines flight, on an Ilyushin Il-12B aircraft, crashed near Eglisau, Switzerland. Three players, two top club officials and a reporter were among others on board the scheduled flight from Zurich to Prague, which crashed in fields after an engine failure. All on board perished.\n\n\n\n"}

It is primarily used for football and soccer, and is the home field of the University of Connecticut (UConn) Huskies. In the fall of 2010, it was home to the Hartford Colonials of the United Football League. The stadium, which opened in 2003, was the first stadium used primarily by an NCAA Division I-A (now FBS) team to open in the 21st century. The permanent stadium capacity is 40,000, consisting of 38,066 permanent seats with a standing-room area in the scoreboard plaza that can accommodate up to 1,934 people. It also has a game day capability to add approximately 2,000 temporary seats as it did for UConn\nfootball vs. Michigan in 2013. Connecticut played on campus at Memorial Stadium in Storrs, before 2003.\n\nRentschler Field was originally the name of the company airfield for Pratt & Whitney that formerly occupied the site. The airfield, which began operations in 1931, was named after Frederick Rentschler, who founded Pratt & Whitney in 1925 and also founded its parent company, United Technologies. It was originally used for test flights and maintenance operations, and later for corporate aviation. The site was decommissioned as an airport in the 1990s, and donated to the state of Connecticut by United Technologies in 1999. A subsequent 65-acre donation by United Technologies in 2009 allowed for the construction of additional grass parking lots adjacent to the Stadium.\n\nPursuant to a lease agreement with the State, UConn plays all its home football games at Rentschler Field.\n\nThe New England Patriots considered moving to Connecticut and sharing a stadium with the UConn football team in the mid-1990s. The new stadium was supposed to be built on the Connecticut Convention Center site in downtown Hartford. However, when the Patriots completed the deal for Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, the Hartford stadium plan was scaled down and the location was moved to East Hartford. The current capacity of 40,000 can expand to 50,000 with limited rehabilitation and has the layout and design for expansion of up to 60,000 seats in the future.\n\nThe stadium is owned by the State of Connecticut, Office of Policy and Management, while operations are overseen by the quasi-public Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA). Global Spectrum, L.P. has managed the building on behalf of CRDA since 2013. Previously, the Stadium was managed by Bushnell Management Services (2011-2013), Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG)(2007-2011) and Madison Square Garden L.P. (2003-2007).\n\nOn July 16, 2015, it was announced that the stadium had been named Pratt & Whitney Stadium in a deal between Pratt & Whitney and UConn. The playing surface is still named Rentschler Field. In return, Pratt and Whitney donated additional land that will be used for game day parking.\n\nThe Connecticut Huskies football team has an all time 59–38 home field advantage at Rentschler Field.\n\nOn September 23, 2017, New York City FC played a home match at Pratt & Whitney Stadium, against the Houston Dynamo, in the stadium's first Major League Soccer game. The game was relocated from Yankee Stadium in New York City due to a schedule conflict with the New York Yankees.\n\nRentschler Field has hosted several United States men's national soccer team's home games, including Landon Donovan's last game for the National Team on October 10, 2014.\n\nRentschler Field has also hosted several United States women's national soccer team's home games.\n\nThe Hartford Colonials were a United Football League team that played their home games at Rentschler Field. During their (2010 UFL season), the Colonials played all four home games at Rentschler, after having played one there the previous season while they were known as the New York Sentinels. Attendance at Colonials games averaged a consistent 15,000 people, third place in the five-team league behind Omaha and Sacramento. The UFL suspended the Colonials franchise in 2011 and the franchise was officially terminated when the team's former owner (Bill Mayer) was named as the new owner of the Virginia Destroyers.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Rentschler Field will host the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship for Divisions I, II, and III.\n\nRentschler Field hosted its first rugby union match on July 3, 2004, when the USA Rugby union hosted France in front of 6,000 people. France would win 39-31.\nOn June 4, 2005, Rentschler Field hosted two rugby union matches; Wales vs USA Rugby and the 2005 U.S. Rugby Super League Championship game, between New York Athletic Club Rugby Football Club and Belmont Shore RFC in front of 8,027. Wales would defeat the US 77-3 and NYAC would defeat Belmont Shore 23 to 19.\n\nOn August 24, 2010, a fan event, called Whalers Fan Fest, occurred, featuring many of the former players, draws were close to 5,000 people on a Saturday afternoon.\nFrom February 11 to the 20th, 2011, the stadium hosted the Whalers Hockey Fest 2011. A hockey rink was constructed on the field much like is done for the annual NHL Winter Classic. Events included a Hartford Whalers Alumni vs. Boston Bruins Alumni game, with an appearance from the Hanson Brothers, from the film Slap Shot (film), a double-header featuring both UConn men's and women's hockey teams, a Hockey Legends team faced off against the Mystery, Alaska Hollywood team, and the second edition of the American Hockey League Outdoor Classic between the host Connecticut Whale and the Providence Bruins. Over 15,000 fans came out to watch the so-called \"Whale Bowl\", while over 1,700 attended the UConn men's game.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31488775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31488775", "title": "Product Architects, Inc.", "text": "Product Architects, Inc.\n\nProduct Architects Inc. is the parent company of Polar Bottle brand insulated sport water bottles and Half Twist lifestyle bottles. The company is based out of Boulder, Colorado where it assembles and ships all of its products.\n\nRobert Heiberger and Judy Amabile founded Product Architects Inc. in 1994. The pair, along with their five employees, ran the company from the garage of their home for a year before moving operations to an industrial park. The business acquired its first national buyer in the form of The Container Store in April 1995 and entered the sporting goods market when they were picked up by Dick’s Sporting Goods later that year. Since then, the company has enjoyed steady growth and was nominated as one of Colorado’s top small businesses in 2010 by ColoradoBiz Magazine. Today, Product Architects Inc. sells its products in over 50 countries across six continents and employs 38 workers.\n\nThe Polar Bottle was invented by Robert Heiberger, with prototypes being made as early as 1989. Heiberger, a mechanical engineer working with heat loss in the medical technology design field, realized that the systems he employed to warm blood samples to body temperature could be used in reverse to keep liquid cool in a bottle. The bottle features a dual-wall construction which creates a layer of insulating air between the liquid inside the bottle and the outside environment. Between the two bottle layers is a thin foil liner that reflects solar energy away from the bottle. The bottle is – and has always been – made from BPA- and Phthalate-free Low-density polyethylene. It is produced in 24-ounce (710 ml) and 20-ounce (590 ml) sizes. The bottles are blow-molded in Denver, CO. Since the Polar Bottle’s introduction, it has undergone continual improvements to both form and function. The first of these changes occurred in 1998 when a removable valve system was added to the cap to facilitate cleaning. In 2006, the bottle’s entire aesthetic was updated with a sleeker body design, the addition of a carrying strap, and the introduction of a variety of colored liners. In 2010, the company added 8 new graphic designs to their existing array of colored liners and, in response to consumer feedback, reduced the thickness of the bottle walls to make squeezing the bottle easier.\n\nThe Half Twist bottle was introduced in 2010 in an effort to expand the scope of Product Architects’ hydration options beyond the sports bottle market. The primary feature of the bottle is the Half Twist cap, which is fitted with a silicone gasket. The lid allows the user to drink directly from the cap without removing it from the bottle and the gasket creates a watertight seal when closed. The Half Twist received positive reviews, though some users found the lid difficult to operate. The lid comes on two types of bottles: a 24-ounce (710 ml) High-density polyethylene bottle and a 28-ounce (828 ml) Stainless steel bottle. Both bottle types are BPA- and Phthalate-free.\n\nProduct Architects released the Modern Wallet in 2004. The wallet was made of Teslin, a synthetic material that is durable, flexible, breathable, and waterproof. It featured a wide variety of pictures and designs that were shown on both the inside and outside of the wallet. It was sold primarily to Independent Bicycle Dealers, many of whom already carried the Polar Bottle. The Modern Wallet was discontinued in 2008.\n"}
{"id": "2612197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2612197", "title": "Punt (Australian football)", "text": "Punt (Australian football)\n\nThe punt kick is a common style of kicking in Australian rules football. It is a kick where the ball is dropped from the players' hands and kicked slightly off the longer center line of the ball before it hits the ground. It is the primary means of kicking the ball in Australian football and is similar to punts used tactically in other football codes, such as American and Canadian football.\n\nThere are different styles of kicking depending on how the ball is held in the hand.\n\nThe most common style of kicking seen in today's game, principally because of its superior accuracy, is the drop punt, where the ball is dropped from the hands down, almost to the ground, to be kicked so that the ball rotates in a reverse end over end motion as it travels through the air. Other commonly used kicks are the torpedo punt (also known as the spiral, barrel, or screw punt), where the ball is held flatter at an angle across the body, which makes the ball spin around its long axis in the air, resulting in extra distance (similar to the traditional motion of an American football punt), and the checkside punt or \"banana\", kicked across the ball on the outside of the foot is used to curve the ball (towards the right if kicked off the right foot) towards targets that are on an angle. There is also the \"snap\", which is almost the same as a checkside punt, except that it is kicked off the inside of the foot and curves in the opposite direction. It is also possible to kick the ball so that it bounces along the ground. This is known as a grubber or dribble kick. Grubbers can bounce in a straight line, or curve to the left or right.\n\nIn a drop punt the ball is held vertically, and dropped and kicked before it hits the ground, resulting in the ball spinning backwards end over end. It is the primary method of disposing the ball by foot in Australian rules football. It is considered more accurate and easier to mark than a regular punt kick, which is held flat and does not spin in the air.\nIn gridiron football it is referred to as a \"pooch punt\" or quick kick, a kick used by punters when the team is too far out for a field goal and too close to kick a normal punt because the ball will probably go into the end zone, losing field position in the resulting touchback. The kick has gradually replaced the less effective \"coffin-corner kick\", which was similar to rugby football's \"kicking for touch\" where the object was to put the ball out of bounds near the opposition goal. Like Australian rules football drop punts, the pooch punt requires the punter to control the distance and former Australian footballers like Darren Bennett and Ben Graham are generally credited with increasing the popularity of this kick in the National Football League.\n\nJack Dyer is generally credited with inventing the drop punt during his playing days with the Richmond Football Club. Horrie Clover and the Collier brothers, Albert and Harry, are also attributed with being the first to use the kick regularly.\n\nThe torpedo punt (also known as screw punt or spiral punt) is the longest type of punt kick. In flight, the ball spins about its long axis, instead of end over end (like a drop punt) or not at all (like a regular punt kick). This makes the flight of the ball more aerodynamic, but more difficult to catch (or mark in some football codes).\n\nIn Australian rules football, the kick has become less common since the 1980s, as modern tactics have meant that accuracy has become typically more important than distance in field kicking; coaches now prefer the use of the drop punt in general field play. The kick may still be seen when a player needs additional distance or when a game is played in wet weather and forward movement by conventional methods is more difficult as a result. If kicked correctly, an Australian football can travel over 60 metres, while a normal punt will travel less distance. Australian rules footballer Gordon Rattray, who played his football with the Fitzroy Football Club between 1917 and 1928, is credited as the first player to use the torpedo punt.\n\nAlso known as a 'banana kick', the checkside punt is a kicking style used in Australian rules football, rugby league and rugby union. When kicked, it bends away from the body. For the true checkside, the ball is held with ends pointing to 2 and 8 o-clock (for a right footed kick) and is kicked more off the outside of the boot with the ball spinning at an opposite direction to the swing of the leg. This enables the ball to have a greater curving effect thus opening up the face of the goals to give a larger goal face.\n\nIn the early 1890s, Allen Burns, who played Australian rules with the (then) Victorian Football Association club South Melbourne, was renowned for what seems to be an early version of the banana kick. The following is taken from newspaper reports of the match between Fitzroy and South Melbourne on Saturday 23 June 1894, that was played in showers of rain, on a very wet and slippery ground, with a very heavy and very wet leather football:\nSt Kilda Full Forward William (Bill) Young is generally thought to be the first player to use the kick in the VFL. He had been using it in the 1940's at Victorian Country Club Stratford and there is photographic evidence of him using it against Collingwood in the 1950's. Others say the kick was first popularised in South Australia in the 1960s by the Sturt Football Club coached by Jack Oatey. He himself was an exponent of the kick decades earlier in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). It is now one of the most common techniques for goal-kicking from a narrow angle, and more recently has been used in field kicking with deadly accuracy by players like James Hird, but was most famously used by Peter Daicos. It is usually used when a set shot for goal is lined up on a narrow angle.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7288429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7288429", "title": "RollerJam", "text": "RollerJam\n\nRollerJam is an American television series featuring roller derby that aired on The Nashville Network (TNN, now Spike) from 1999 to 2001. It was the first attempt to bring roller derby to TV since RollerGames.\n\n\"RollerJam\" was derived from the original roller derby, but newer skaters used inline skates to modernize the sport (several skaters, mostly older ones, used the traditional quad skates). The program was taped at Universal Studios Stage 21 in Orlando, Florida, known as \"RollerJam Arena\" and now the Impact Wrestling Zone, for the first and second seasons (1999 and 2000) and the former \"American Gladiators\" arena in the show's final season. The first few weeks of the show's second season, which ran from August to October 1999, were taped at the MGM Grand Las Vegas.\n\n\"RollerJam\" was the brainchild of Knoxville, Tennessee-based television impresarios Ross K. Bagwell, Sr. and Stephen Land. Land, a fan of roller derby in boyhood, was inspired to bring the sport back to television by an obituary for roller derby legend Joan Weston that he had read in the \"New York Times\" in May 1997, and shared his idea with Bagwell, his mentor, who gave him a positive response. Between January 1999 and January 2001, Bagwell and Land, under the name Pageboy Entertainment, collaborated with CBS to stage this new televised revival of roller derby.\n\nIn May 1998, Bagwell and Land pitched their idea to The Nashville Network (TNN). The network agreed to air the show but wanted it ready by the new year, forcing Bagwell and Land to create a league, recruit skaters, build a track, design logos and uniforms, hire a television crew, and record the program all in a span of about seven months. In an attempt to build continuity between \"RollerJam\" and previous roller derby incarnations, Bagwell and Land hired Jerry Seltzer, the son of roller derby creator Leo Seltzer, to be commissioner of their new league. The first episode of the show was taped in November 1998, a week after Thanksgiving.\n\n\"RollerJam\" featured several teams of skaters competing in the fictional World Skating League (WSL). Jerry Seltzer served as on-screen WSL commissioner, although he only made a few appearances. The initial teams, each consisting of seven men and seven women, were the New York Enforcers, California Quakes, Florida Sundogs, Nevada Hot Dice, Texas Rustlers, and Illinois Riot (the original names of the latter three teams were the Las Vegas High Rollers, Texas Twisters, and Illinois Inferno; their names were changed prior to the start of the first season). Two notable veterans from Roller Games, \"Rockin'\" Ray Robles and \"Latin Spitfire\" Patsy Delgato, were featured in the second season of \"RollerJam\". Despite strong funding and four seasons of broadcasts on TNN, the venture never became a \"live\" attraction. Fabricated storylines and characters in the mode of professional wrestling were being featured more than actual competitive skating around season 3 and 4, raising the ire of many skaters and fans of true roller derby.\n\nGames were played in four 6-minute periods with as many 60-second jams as possible; women skated odd numbered periods, and the men skated the even-numbered periods. (In traditional roller derby, the game has eight 12-minute periods, again with 60-second jams.) Jams began and ended on the referee's whistle, and a buzzer sounded to reinforce this.\n\nWhereas traditional derby employs a pivot skater, RollerJam did not use one. Instead, each team had 3 blockers, each wearing a white helmet, and two jammers, each wearing a black helmet with red stripes. In-line skates were legalized in attempt to modernize the sport, but certain skaters opted still to use the quad skates.\n\nIn seasons 1-2, the game was played like traditional derby in that the first jam began from the black start/finish line, while the skaters had to continuously skate until a time-out was called or the period ended. In seasons 3-4, this changed to every single jam starting from a standstill start from the black line. In either case, jammers had to start from the back of the pack (the whole group) and work their way through, with the first jammer to break out winning the status of lead jammer. The skaters then got one point for every opponent they successfully lapped. The lead jammer could cut off the jam early by placing their hands on their hips.\n\nThe last jam of the last period always went the full minute regardless of what the period clock showed.\n\nAt the referee's discretion, skaters would sit in a penalty box for violating the rules for various reasons, from 1-2 jams, or face immediate disqualification (ejection) from the game. Skaters frequently racked up these penalties and were willing to take it if they felt it would bring them a moral victory.\n\nThe team with the most points won the game. If the game was tied in regulation, originally the genders would continue to alternate in sudden death overtime periods until there was a clear winner but instead one skater from each team face-off in a Tiebreaker Match Race, 5 laps around the track and whoever crosses the finish line first wins the game for their team.\n\nIn addition, special features would occasionally pop up:\n\nAnother unique concept was that Rollerjam held special games, races and competitions in certain episodes, such as:\n\nThree of the most notable actors featured in \"RollerJam\" were veteran movie actor Tom Nowicki (who played WSL general manager Kenneth Loge III and Sundogs manager Leonard Loge III), Cindy Maranne (who played Amanda Hertz, the manager of the Nevada Hot Dice), former ESPN and current CBS Sports Network play-by-play commentator James Bates (who played \"The Prophet\", a character in Season 4 only who would interrupt games to make speeches, and later managed the Sundogs), and stage actress and former Mouseketeer Lindsey Alley (who played Lisa Seltzer, the \"granddaughter\" of Leo Seltzer). Other characters included Julie Amazon (a bodybuilding skater in Season 4), Canine and Disable (minions of The Prophet who skated for the Sundogs, and \"captured\" Lindsay Francis during the first game of Season 4),Devo (a convict character who skated for the Hot Dice), Lil Nasty (A midget who is a sidekick to Tim Washington) and El Numero (A masked luchador Who skated for the Enforcers).\n\nThe most points ever scored in one jam was 28 in Period 3 of a game between the New York Enforcers and the Illinois Riot. The Riot came back from a 20+ point deficit to win 46-43 in the highest scoring game in RollerJam history. Roller Derby legend Ann Calvello, best known for her brutal feuds with Joan Weston, skated a match race with Kenneth Loge III in \"RollerJam\"'s finale. She emerged victorious.\n\nRon Buffone, a producer for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), called \"RollerJam\" \"That stupid roller blading show\". Buffone believed that TNN treated \"ECW on TNN\", which aired prior to \"RollerJam\" on Friday nights, as a lead-in for \"RollerJam\" rather than a show in its own right, despite the fact that the ECW broadcast generated the network's highest ratings. Nevertheless, some cross-promotion between the two programs did occur, notably when ECW wrestlers such as Axl Rotten and Tommy Dreamer appeared on \"RollerJam\" as \"enforcers\" for the Florida Sundogs against the New York Enforcers.\n\n\n\n\n\nA game based on the show was developed by BLAM! and published by Electronic Arts for the playstation The Rollerjam game made an appearance as an IGN preview. according to Neoseekers, the RollerJam video game was set for a release in the 2nd quarter of 2002, but contrary to IGN release date, as the game was supposed to be released on 2001. But no other trace of information came through about the game being released or canceled without a confirmation.\n\nThe video game itself became featured in Rollerjam as a feud, where the game was announced by EA's Steve Sims, around the halftime of the Nevada Hot Dice Vs. New York Enforcers game on March 21, 2000, during Rollerjams 3rd season \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located approximately south of Kuala Lumpur, and close to Kuala Lumpur International Airport. It hosted the Formula One Malaysian Grand Prix between 1999 and 2017, and is also the venue for the Malaysian Motorcycle Grand Prix, the Malaysia Merdeka Endurance Race and other major motorsport events.\n\nThe circuit was designed by German designer Hermann Tilke, who would subsequently design F1 venues in Shanghai, Sakhir, Istanbul, Valencia, Marina Bay, Yas Marina, Yeongnam, Greater Noida, Austin and Baku.\n\nThe circuit was officially inaugurated by the 4th Prime Minister of Malaysia Tun Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamad on 7 March 1999 at 20:30 MST (). He subsequently went on to inaugurate the first Moto GP Malaysian Grand Prix on 20 April 1999 (see 1999 Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix) and the first Formula One Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix on 17 October 1999 (see 1999 Malaysian Grand Prix).\n\nOn 23 October 2011, on the second lap of the MotoGP Shell Advance Malaysian Grand Prix, the Italian motorcycle racer Marco Simoncelli died following a crash in turn 11 on Lap 2, resulting in an abandonment of the race.\n\nIn October 2016 it was mooted that the Sepang circuit may be dropped from the Formula One series due to dwindling ticket sales, and held its nineteenth and last World Championship Grand Prix in 2017.<ref name=\"bbc.com/sport\"></ref>\n\nThe main circuit, normally raced in a clockwise direction, is long, and is noted for its sweeping corners and wide straights. The layout is quite unusual, with a very long back straight (927 metres) separated from the pit straight by just one very tight hairpin.\n\nOther configurations of the Sepang circuit can also be used. The north circuit is also raced in a clockwise direction. It is basically the first half of the main circuit. The course turns back towards the pit straight after turn 6 and is 2.71 kilometres long in total.\n\nThe south circuit is the other half of the racecourse. The back straight of the main circuit becomes the pit straight when the south circuit is in use, and joins onto turn 8 of the main circuit to form a hairpin turn. Also run clockwise, this circuit is 2.61 km in length.\n\nSepang International Circuit also features kart racing and motocross facilities.\n\nSepang starts with a long pit straight where the DRS zone exists – crucial for drivers to get a good exit out of the last corner to gain as much speed as possible. Turn 1 is a very long, slow corner taken in second gear. Most drivers brake incredibly late and lose speed gradually as they file round the corner, similar to Shanghai's first turn but slower. Turn 1 leads straight into Turn 2, a tight left hairpin which goes downhill quite significantly. The first two corners are quite bumpy, making it hard to put power onto the track. Turn 3 is a long flat out right hander which leads into Turn 4 – known locally as the Langkawi Curve – a second gear, right-angle right-hander. Turns 5 and 6 make up an incredibly high-speed, long chicane that hurts tyres and puts a lot of stress on drivers due to high G-Force. It is locally known as the Genting Curve. Turns 7 and 8 (the KLIA curve) make up a long, medium-speed, double-apex right hander, and a bump can cause the car to lose balance here. Turn 9 is a very slow left-hand hairpin (the Berjaya Tioman Corner), similar to turn two but uphill. Turn 10 leads into a challenging, medium-speed right hander at turn 11, requiring braking and turning simultaneously. Turn 12 is a flat-out, bumpy left which immediately leads into the flat right at turn 13, then the challenging 'Sunway Lagoon' curve at turn 14. Similar to turn 11, it requires hard-braking and steering at the same time. It is taken in second gear. The long back straight can be a good place for drivers to overtake as they brake hard into turn 15, a left-handed, second-geared hairpin but drivers are advised by experts to be careful not to get re-overtaken as they come into turn 1.\n\n\n\n"}

Sport has been one of the main activities used to unify Arabs. Several tournaments and games were created to let Arab participate in sports, in an effort to bring the members of the Arab world closer to each other.\n\nThe Pan Arab Games were created in 1953 with a grand opening in Alexandria, which hosted the first Games; the games were supposed to take place every four years, like the Olympic Games. Several political problems have made this difficult. The Games included most of the same events as the Olympics. Egypt, with 985 medals over the years, is the leader in medal wins, followed by Syria with 692 medals, then Algeria with 624 medals. Mauritania and Comoros are the only two Arab States that never won a medal in the games.\n\nIn nearly 100 years of Olympic competition, the combined tally of medals won by all Arab countries is 73. At 22 countries, the Arab nations constitute almost 11 per cent of the total number of participating nations (204). However, the average number of medals won - 3.48 medals every four years - has been uninspiring. In the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, for example, Arab countries won only 10 of the 929 medals available - a little over one per cent.\n\nThough the modern version of the Olympic games began in 1896, it was not until 1912 that Arabs appeared on the international sporting scene. Egypt became the first Arab country to send an Olympic delegation - fencer Ahmed Hassanein - to the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.\nSixteen years later, Egypt won its first two gold medals, in weightlifting and wrestling, and a silver and bronze in diving at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. Since then it has maintained its competitive edge over other Arab countries and leads the Olympic chart among Arab nations with a total of 23 medals.\n\nIn the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Egypt sent the largest Arab delegation of more than 100 athletes competing in handball, field hockey, badminton, synchronised swimming, judo, boxing, taekwondo, athletics, fencing and the pentathlon.\n\nThe 1984 Summer Olympics (Los Angeles) marked a watershed moment for Arab athletics when Morocco's Nawal El Moutawakel became the first Arab woman to win a gold medal, participating in the 400m hurdles.\n\nFellow countryman Saïd Aouita also brought home the gold in the 5000m men's marathon.\n\nMoroccan talent continued to emerge as athletic sensation Hicham El Guerrouj returned from the 2004 Athens Olympics with two gold medals in the 1500m and 5000m races. Morocco is second to Egypt with 19 Olympic medals.\n\nFour African and four Asian members of the Arab League have qualified to the FIFA World Cup. Morocco advanced to round of 16 in 1986, Saudi Arabia in 1994, and Algeria in 2014. Neither team has reached quarter-finals.\n\nThe Union of Arab Football Associations, established in 1974, organizes the Arab Nations Cup and UAFA Club Championship.\n\nAfrican members of the Arab League have hosted 12 editions of the Africa Cup of Nations, with another scheduled for 2017:\n\n\nMeanwhile, Asian members of the Arab League have hosted five editions of the AFC Asian Cup:\n\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to be held in Qatar.\n\n\n\n"}
