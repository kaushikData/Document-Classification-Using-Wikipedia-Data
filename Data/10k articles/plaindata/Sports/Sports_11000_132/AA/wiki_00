{"id": "586504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=586504", "title": "Baggy green", "text": "Baggy green\n\nThe baggy green is a cricket cap of dark myrtle green colour, which has been worn by Australian Test cricketers since around the turn of the twentieth century. The cap was not originally baggy as evidenced by photographs of early players. The cap has long been a symbol of national pride in Australia, and was described by the chief executive of the MCC as the \"most famous cricket cap in the world\".\n\nWhile respect for the baggy green cap has always been high, it has grown in stature since the 1990s, chiefly due to the efforts of captains Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh. Waugh regularly expressed his belief that the honouring of the traditions of the game was critical to the success of a team: \"To be able to partake of these rituals and traditions has meant you have been awarded the highest honour in Australian cricket — you have been selected to play for your country.\" \n\nThe baggy green cap was originally supplied to the player as part of a kit of equipment, and a new one was routinely issued for each tour, with the year number on it. In fact, a few former Australian players have been known to use the cap for 'non-cricketing' purposes. Bill Lawry used the cap while cleaning his pigeon's nest, while Bill Ponsford was known to wear the cap to protect his hair while painting the fence in front of his house. Ian Chappell never kept any of his baggy green caps. In the early 1990s an unofficial practice emerged amongst test players never to replace a baggy green cap, most notably by Steve Waugh. Although there is no official rule against a player obtaining a replacement cap from Cricket Australia, this almost never occurs, and the increasingly dilapidated state of an aging baggy green cap is a \"de facto\" symbol of seniority amongst the players in the team.\n\nDuring his captaincy Taylor instituted a pre-match ceremony for the awarding of a cap. This continued under Waugh, who introduced a refinement whereby new players would receive their \"baggy green\" from a past player of a similar discipline (batsman, spin bowler, etc.). Ponting changed it again, making the presentation himself rather than using a former player. Another tradition instituted by Taylor (but suggested by Steve Waugh, and one that has also continued) is the practice of all players wearing the cap during the first session in the field of a Test match, as a symbol of solidarity. Even Shane Warne, known for his preference for a floppy sun hat, observed this tradition without question. Modern players seldom wear the baggy green cap while batting, choosing a protective helmet instead, especially when facing faster bowlers.\n\nBaggy green caps can in some cases be prized as valuable sporting memorabilia. The cap worn by Sir Donald Bradman during his final season in 1948 sold in 2003 for A$425,000, and the 1953 cap of Keith Miller sold at auction for A$35,000. Even the caps of lesser-known players have fetched figures above A$10,000.\n\nSometimes incorrectly called a \"crest\", the \"achievement\" or coat of arms on the Baggy Green cap is a pre-federation symbol representing Australian commercial endeavours of the time: wool-growing, shipping, mining and agriculture.\n\nIt consists of: a crest (being a rising sun); over a torse (or wreath) of red and gold; over a shield (bearing images of a golden fleece, a sailing ship, a pick-axe and shovel and a garb of wheat, all quartered by a southern cross); supporters (being a kangaroo and an emu); all over a motto (\"Australia\") on a scroll.\n\nThe baggy green worn by male players has the motto in gold on a red background; on the women's baggy green, the motto and background colours are reversed.\n\nContrary to a common belief, with the exception of the supporters and the motto, this coat of arms is entirely different to the present and any former national coat of arms. Since 1912 the Coat of Arms of Australia has borne the badges of the six Australian states, enclosed and unified on a shield under a wreath of blue and gold bearing a Commonwealth Star.\n\nThe device on the cap is sometimes referred to as Australia's Cricket Coat of Arms, although it has otherwise been abandoned by Cricket Australia. It is replicated on the protective helmet, but not on any other badged item of clothing worn by the Australian team. These now feature the current logogram of Cricket Australia, being a modern distorted shield with the ubiquitous Southern Cross on a green and gold field of a rising sun and a wicket casting a shadow on a pitch.\n\n"}

Completed in 1945, it is currently undergoing renovation work.\n\nThe Baguio Athletic Bowl was built in 1945. The venue is under the ownership of the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA). Through Executive Order 224 issued by President Fidel V. Ramos on February 10, 1995 transferring the management, administration, and maintenance responsibilities from the PTA to the Baguio City Government. Further powers were given to the city government when it is given rights to “control and further development\" of Burnham Park in pursuant to Executive Order 695 issued by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo issued in January 10, 2008.\n\nThe Baguio City Government leased the park to an undisclosed company to develop the Athletic Bowl and Burnham Park for P1.43 per square meter. The deal between the investors and the city government was reached in December 10, 2009 and was later approved by the city council in December 11 of the same year. The property would have been leased for 25 years with a monthly lease of P100,000 per month, with a 10 percent increased after five years. The plan involved building a hotel, a driving range, and a bus terminal. The planned development was a subject of controversy among Baguio residents. On January 8, 2010, Baguio City Mayor Reinaldo Bautista, Jr. said that the plan is not yet final and is still a proposal. The proposal was later scrapped by the city government.\n\nIn 2012, Mayor Mauricio Domogan announced new plans to development of the Baguio Athletic Bowl and Burnham Park. The plan generated concerns with Councilor Edison Bilog calling Baguio residents to remain vigilant against commercialization of the park and cutting of trees for the development particular those at the World Park at the back of the Athletic Bowl. Domogan responded that the trees mentioned by Bilog will not be affected by the development and that he has sent the terms of reference of the project to the city council.\n\nAt least three phases of renovation work are planned for the Athletic Bowl. Phase 1 involved the construction of a multipurpose office, a grandstand and the 75 percent completion of the venue's bleachers. The bleachers were installed by Department of Public Works and Highways-Cordillera. Phase 1 was completed in January 2015 and Phase 2 of the renovation work started. Phase 2 was suspended in early February 2015 due to Baguio's hosting of the 2015 Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Association Meet and the annual Panagbenga Festival celebrations. Phase 2 resumed after the conclusion of Panagbenga celebrations in March.\n\nPhase 2, was planned to be completed by February 2016, in time for the 2016 Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Association (Caraa) meet which involved the installing of rubber tracks from Switzerland, continuation of unfinished bleachers and repair of the venue's old drainage system. Spurway Enterprises and R.U. Aquino Construction were involved in this phase.\n\nThe Baguio Athletic Bowl was reopened to the public on January 29, 2016 following about two years of renovations. A 5,000 meter fun run activity was organized as part of the reopening ceremonies.\n\nPhase 3 is planned to commence in March 2016 which includes the reconstruction of the second bleachers.\n"}

{"id": "67679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67679", "title": "Bullet", "text": "Bullet\n\nA bullet is a kinetic projectile and the component of firearm ammunition that is expelled from the gun barrel during shooting. The term is from Middle French and originated as the diminutive of the word \"boulle\" (\"boullet\"), which means \"small ball\". Bullets are made of a variety of materials such as copper, lead, steel, polymer, rubber and even wax. They are available either singly as in muzzleloading and cap and ball firearms or as a component of paper cartridges, but much more commonly in the form of metallic cartridges. Bullets are made in a large number of shapes and constructions depending on the intended applications, including specialized functions such as hunting, target shooting, training and combat.\n\nThough the word \"bullet\" is often used incorrectly in colloquial language to refer to a cartridge round, a bullet is \"not\" a cartridge but rather a component of one. A round of ammunition cartridge is a combination package of the bullet (which is the projectile), the case (which holds everything together), the propellant (which provide majority of the energy to launch the projectile) and the primer (which ignites the propellant). This use of the term \"bullet\" when intending to describe a cartridge often leads to confusion when the components of a cartridge are specifically referred to.\n\nBullet sizes are expressed by their weights and diameters (referred to as \"calibers\") in both imperial and metric measurement systems. For example: 55 grain .223 caliber bullets are of the same weight and caliber as 3.56 gram 5.56mm caliber bullets.\n\nThe bullets used in many cartridges are fired at muzzle velocities faster than the speed of sound — about in dry air at — and thus can travel a substantial distance to a target before a nearby observer hears the sound of the shot. The sound of gunfire (i.e. the muzzle report) is often accompanied with a loud bullwhip-like crack as the supersonic bullet pierces through the air creating a sonic boom. Bullet speeds at various stages of flight depend on intrinsic factors such as its sectional density, aerodynamic profile and ballistic coefficient, and extrinsic factors such as barometric pressure, humidity, air temperature and wind speed. Subsonic cartridges fire bullets slower than the speed of sound so there is no sonic boom. This means that a subsonic cartridge, such as .45 ACP, can be substantially quieter than a supersonic cartridge such as the .223 Remington, even without the use of a suppressor.\n\nBullets do not normally contain explosives, but damage the intended target by transferring kinetic energy upon impact and penetration (see terminal ballistics).\n\nThe first use of gunpowder in Europe was recorded in 1247. It had been used in China for hundreds of years. The cannon appeared in 1327. Later in 1364, the hand cannon appeared. Early projectiles were made of stone. Stone was used in cannon and hand cannon. In cannon it was eventually found that stone would not penetrate stone fortifications which gave rise to the use of heavier metals for the round projectiles. Hand cannon projectiles developed in a similar fashion following the failure of stone from siege cannon. The first recorded instance of a metal ball from a hand cannon penetrating armor occurred in 1425. In this photograph of shot retrieved from the wreck of the \"Mary Rose\" which was sunk in 1545 and raised in 1982. The round shot are clearly of different sizes and some are stone while others are cast iron.\nThe development of the hand culverin and matchlock arquebus brought about the use of cast lead balls as projectiles. \"Bullet\" is derived from the French word \"boulette\", which roughly means \"little ball\". The original round musket ball was smaller than the bore of the barrel. It was loaded into the barrel first, just resting upon the powder, and later using some sort of material as a wadding, between the ball and the powder as well as over the ball to keep it in place . that held the bullet firmly in the barrel and against the powder. (Bullets not firmly on the powder risked exploding the barrel, with the condition known as a \"short start\".)\n\nThe loading of muskets was, therefore, easy with the old smooth-bore Brown Bess and similar military muskets. The original muzzle-loading rifle, however, was loaded with a piece of leather or cloth wrapped around the ball, to allow the ball to engage the grooves in the barrel. Loading was a bit more difficult, particularly when the bore of the barrel was fouled from previous firings. For this reason, and because rifles were not often fitted for a bayonet, early rifles were not generally used for military purposes.\n\nThe first half of the nineteenth century saw a distinct change in the shape and function of the bullet. In 1826, Henri-Gustave Delvigne, a French infantry officer, invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which a spherical bullet was rammed down until it caught the rifling grooves. Delvigne's method, however, deformed the bullet and was inaccurate.\n\nSquare bullets have origins that almost pre-date civilization and were used by slingers in slings. They were typically made out of copper or lead. The most notable use of square bullet designs was done by, James Puckle and Kyle Tunis who patented them, where they were briefly used in one version of the Puckle gun. The early use of these in the black-powder era was soon discontinued due to irregular and unpredictable flight patterns.\n\nDelvigne continued to develop bullet design and by 1830 had started to develop cylindro-conical bullets. His bullet designs were improved by Francois Tamisier with the addition of \"ball grooves\" which are known as \"cannelures\", these moved the resistance of air behind the center of gravity of the bullet. \n\nTamisier also developed progressive rifling. The rifle grooves were deeper toward the breech, becoming shallower as they progressed toward the muzzle. This causes the bullet to be progressively molded into the grooves which increased range and accuracy. \n\nThe Thouvenin rifle barrel had a forcing plug in the breech of the barrel to mold the bullet into the rifling with the use of a special ramrod. While successful in increasing accuracy it was extremely hard to clean. These improvements were the basis for the development of the Minié Ball.\n\nAmong the first pointed or \"conical\" bullets were those designed by Captain John Norton of the British Army in 1832. Norton's bullet had a hollow base made of lotus pith that, on firing, expanded under pressure to engage with a barrel's rifling. The British Board of Ordnance rejected it because spherical bullets had been in use for the previous 300 years.\n\nRenowned English gunsmith William Greener invented the Greener bullet in 1836. Greener fitted the hollow base of an oval bullet with a wooden plug that more reliably forced the base of the bullet to expand and catch the rifling. Tests proved that Greener's bullet was extremely effective, but the military rejected it too because, being two parts, they judged it as too complicated to produce.\nThe soft lead Minié ball was first introduced in 1847 by Claude-Étienne Minié, a captain in the French Army. It was another improvement of the work done by Delvigne. As designed by Minié, the bullet was conical in shape with a hollow cavity in the rear, which was fitted with a small iron cap instead of a wooden plug. When fired, the iron cap would force itself into the hollow cavity at the rear of the bullet, thus expanding the sides of the bullet to grip and engage the rifling. In 1855, the British adopted the Minié ball for their Enfield rifles. In 1855 James Burton, a machinist at the US Armory at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia improved the Minié Ball further by eliminating the metal cup in the bottom of the bullet. The Minié ball first saw widespread use in the American Civil War. Roughly 90% of the battlefield casualties in this war were caused by Minié balls fired from rifled muskets.\n\nA similar bullet called the Nessler ball was also developed for smoothbore muskets.\n\nBetween 1854 and 1857, Sir Joseph Whitworth conducted a long series of rifle experiments, and proved, among other points, the advantages of a smaller bore and, in particular, of an elongated bullet. The Whitworth bullet was made to fit the grooves of the rifle mechanically. The Whitworth rifle was never adopted by the government, although it was used extensively for match purposes and target practice between 1857 and 1866, when it was gradually superseded by Metford's.\nIn 1861 W.B. Chace approached President Abraham Lincoln with an improved ball design for muskets. In firing over the Potomac river where the Chace ball and the round ball were alternated Lincoln observed that the Chace design carried a third or more farther fired at the same elevation. Although Lincoln recommended testing it never took place.\n\nAbout 1862 and later, W. E. Metford carried out an exhaustive series of experiments on bullets and rifling, and invented the important system of light rifling with increasing spiral, and a hardened bullet. The combined result was that in December 1888 the Lee–Metford small-bore (0.303\", 7.70 mm) rifle, Mark I, was finally adopted for the British army. The Lee–Metford was the predecessor of the Lee–Enfield.\n\nThe next important change in the history of the rifle bullet occurred in 1882, when Lt. Colonel Eduard Rubin, director of the Swiss Army Laboratory at Thun, invented the copper-jacketed bullet — an elongated bullet with a lead core in a copper jacket. It was also small bore (7.5mm and 8mm) and it is the precursor of the 8mm \"Lebel bullet\" adopted for the smokeless powder ammunition of the Mle 1886 Lebel rifle.\n\nThe surface of lead bullets fired at high velocity may melt due to hot gases behind and friction with the bore. Because copper has a higher melting point, and greater specific heat capacity and hardness, copper-jacketed bullets allow greater muzzle velocities.\nEuropean advances in aerodynamics led to the pointed spitzer bullet. By the beginning of the twentieth century, most world armies had begun to transition to spitzer bullets. These bullets flew for greater distances more accurately and carried more energy with them. Spitzer bullets combined with machine guns greatly increased the lethality of the battlefield.\n\nThe latest advancement in bullet shape was the boat tail, a streamlined base for spitzer bullets. The vacuum created as air moving at high speed passes over the end of a bullet slows the projectile. The streamlined boat tail design reduces this form drag by allowing the air to flow along the surface of the tapering end. The resulting aerodynamic advantage is currently seen as the optimum shape for rifle technology. The first combination spitzer and boat-tail bullet, named Balle \"D\" from its inventor (a lieutenant-colonel Desaleux), was introduced as standard military ammunition in 1901, for the French Lebel Model 1886 rifle.\n\nA ballistic tip bullet is a hollow-point rifle bullet that has a plastic tip on the end of the bullet itself. This improves external ballistics by streamlining the bullet, allowing it to cut through the air more easily, and improves terminal ballistics by allowing the bullet to act as a JHP on impact.\n\nAs a side effect, it also feeds better in weapons that have trouble feeding rounds that are not FMJ rounds.\n\nBullet designs have to solve two primary problems. In the barrel, they must first form a seal with the gun's bore. If a strong seal is not achieved, gas from the propellant charge leaks past the bullet, thus reducing efficiency and possibly accuracy. The bullet must also engage the rifling without damaging or excessively fouling the gun's bore, and without distorting the bullet, which will also reduce accuracy. Bullets must have a surface that forms this seal without excessive friction. These interactions between bullet and bore are termed internal ballistics. Bullets must be produced to a high standard, as surface imperfections can affect firing accuracy.\n\nThe physics affecting the bullet once it leaves the barrel is termed external ballistics. The primary factors affecting the aerodynamics of a bullet in flight are the bullet's shape and the rotation imparted by the rifling of the gun barrel. Rotational forces stabilize the bullet gyroscopically as well as aerodynamically. Any asymmetry in the bullet is largely canceled as it spins. However, a spin rate greater than the optimum value adds more trouble than good, by magnifying the smaller asymmetries or sometimes resulting in the bullet exploding midway in flight. With smooth-bore firearms, a spherical shape was optimum because no matter how it was oriented, it presented a uniform front. These unstable bullets tumbled erratically and provided only moderate accuracy; however, the aerodynamic shape changed little for centuries. Generally, bullet shapes are a compromise between aerodynamics, interior ballistic necessities, and terminal ballistics requirements. Another method of stabilization is to place the center of mass of the bullet as far forward as is practical, which is how the Minié ball and the shuttlecock are designed. This makes the bullet fly front-forward by means of aerodynamics.\n\nSee the articles on terminal ballistics and/or stopping power for an overview of how bullet design affects what happens when a bullet impacts with an object. The outcome of the impact is determined by the composition and density of the target material, the angle of incidence, and the velocity and physical characteristics of the bullet itself. Bullets are generally designed to penetrate, deform, or break apart. For a given material and bullet, the strike velocity is the primary factor that determines which outcome is achieved.\n\nBullet shapes are many and varied, and an array of them can be found in any reloading manual that sells bullet moulds. Mould manufacturers such as RCBS, Paul Jones Moulds, and David Mos offer many different calibers and designs. With a mould, bullets can be made at home for reloading one's own ammunition, where local laws allow. Hand-casting, however, is only time- and cost-effective for solid lead bullets. Cast and jacketed bullets are also commercially available from numerous manufacturers for hand loading and are much more convenient than casting bullets from bulk lead.\n\nPropulsion of the ball can happen via several methods:\n\nBullets for black powder, or muzzle-loading firearms, were classically molded from pure lead. This worked well for low-speed bullets, fired at velocities of less than 450 m/s (1475 ft/s). For slightly higher-speed bullets fired in modern firearms, a harder alloy of lead and tin or typesetter's lead (used to mold Linotype) works very well. For even higher-speed bullet use, jacketed coated lead bullets are used. The common element in all of these, lead, is widely used because it is very dense, thereby providing a high amount of mass—and thus, kinetic energy—for a given volume. Lead is also cheap, easy to obtain, easy to work, and melts at a low temperature, which results in comparatively easy fabrication of bullets.\n\n\nPoisonous bullets were a subject to an international agreement as early as the Strasbourg Agreement (1675).\n\nThe St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 prohibited the use of explosive projectiles weighing less than 400 grams.The reasoning was that they figured if bullets were more deadly there would be less suffering.\n\nThe Hague Convention prohibits certain kinds of ammunition for use by uniformed military personnel against the uniformed military personnel of opposing forces. These include projectiles that explode within an individual, poisoned and expanding bullets.\n\nProtocol III of the 1983 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, an annexe to the Geneva Conventions, prohibits the use of incendiary ammunitions against civilians.\n\nThese treaties apply even to .22 LR bullets used in pistols, rifles and machine guns. Hence, the High Standard HDM pistol, a .22 LR suppressed pistol, had special bullets developed for it during World War II that were full metal jacketed, in place of the soft-point and hollow-point bullets that are otherwise ubiquitous for .22 LR rounds.\n\nSome jurisdictions acting on environmental concerns have banned hunting with lead bullets and shotgun pellets.\n\nIn December 2014, a federal appeals court denied a lawsuit by environmental groups that the EPA must use the Toxic Substances Control Act to regulate lead in shells and cartridges. The groups sought to regulate \"spent lead\", yet EPA could not regulate spent lead without also regulating cartridges and shells, per the court.\n\n\n"}

It is also known popularly as the Estadio Único (\"One-of-a kind Stadium\") and is owned by the Province of Buenos Aires, administered jointly by the provincial government, the Municipality of La Plata, and the football clubs Estudiantes de La Plata and Gimnasia y Esgrima de la Plata.\n\nOpened on June 7, 2003, the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata is one of the most modern of Latin America, even without having completed all of the planned construction. Its tenants include Estudiantes LP and Gimnasia y Esgrima LP. Gimnasia returned to their original stadium in mid-2008.\n\nIt is located between 32nd and 526th avenues, 25 Street and 21. These fields also contain a small rugby stadium and a center for Physical Education, which tend to be intercollegiate events with schools in the area, such as the school No. 31, better known as the Saint Martin Commercial.\n\nBesides the planned placement of the cover to the third stage, which will begin in 2009, by virtue of being made the first two stages.\n\nThe idea of the project began in 1947 when Governor Domingo Mercante expropriated the property located at the junction of Roads 32 and 25 and formed the La Plata Sports Complex.\n\nIn 1972, La Plata was to be a candidate to host matches in the 1978 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIn 1989, after a meeting between the Buenos Aires Province Government and the Municipality of La Plata's, Estudiantes and Gimnasia, created a committee to build and manage a complex dedicated entirely to the practice of football and other sports.\n\nThus, after reviewing several alternatives, the construction of the stadium was proposed to take place in the area of the Center for Physical Education No. 2. This determined as the most accessible area for a stadium in La Plata. In January 1992 it was signed into law 11118, which established the construction site.\n\nOn April 21, 1992, the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata Foundation was established, which was an institution composed equally of representatives from Estudiantes and Gimnasia. The College of Architects and Engineers held a meeting in April 1993 to choose an architectural proposal. It was awarded to Roberto Ferreira & Associates.\n\nIn 1996 a permit was given by the Executive Branch that awarded the provincial administration the right to begin construction the following year. The Executive Unit called for public tenders for the job.\n\nA year later they began building the supports for the roof. And in 1998, the governor Eduardo Duhalde and the Mayor of La Plata, Julio Alak, laid the first stone to begin the construction of the stadium.\n\nThe works also detained foir trade union and economic problems in 2000, so ad with Eduardo Duhalde as President of the Nation, called for a new tender for the allocation of investment with a view to its installation in May 2003.\n\nThe stadium opened on June 7, 2003. The stadium was temporarily closed to convert it into an all-seater stadium, and to install a new roof intended to cover all seats. Work had gone ahead of schedule and the roof was finished before the end of February. The stadium was officially reopened on February 17, 2011, and its first match was played six days later between Estudiantes and Deportes Tolima for the Group 7 of the 2011 Copa Libertadores.\n\nThe stadium has since become a significant venue for musicians on tour. Over 300,000 tickets to such events at the stadium were sold in 2011, ranking the La Plata Stadium fifth worldwide in performing events tickets sold.\n\nThe stadium has hosted at least two friendly matches featuring the national team.\nThe stadium was confirmed as one of seven venues to host the 2011 Copa América in Argentina including the opening game. La Plata ended up hosting a total of six matches.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted a number of rugby matches between the Argentina Pumas and the New Zealand All Blacks as part of the Rugby Championship, which Argentina joined in 2012.\n\n\n"}

The blog's appearance coincided with the start of the 2009 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament.\n\nOriginally, the blogger wrote anonymously, widely believed to be a member of the IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). The blog was controversial from the start, giving unflattering nicknames to players, coaches, and owners of KKR and other teams, telling sordid stories, and showing most of them in a very negative light. As the blog rapidly became popular, it was believed to be of a fringe KKR player who was upset at not being part of the core team. The blog worsened an already bad season for KKR, which lost most of their games, had controversies surrounding their coach, John Buchanan, and frequently changed captains, including Sourav Ganguly. The 2009 IPL season took place in South Africa, and two KKR players, Aakash Chopra and Sanjay Bangar, were sent home to India midway through the tournament. This fuelled speculation that they were suspected of being the person behind the blog. The team was also rumoured to have banned use of laptops by players. The management of the team termed the blog as \"poison pen writing of the dirtiest variety\", while denying it could have been written by an actual player. The blogger posted a disclaimer saying \"All characters appearing in this work (blog) are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental and unintentional.\"\n\nIn August 2010, Bangalore based marketing specialist Anupam Mukerji revealed himself on television and newspapers as the person writing the blog. He said he had \"never met a cricketer in his life\", and was just making up stories. He never expected it to become this big, he remarked, adding that the Fake Player ended up getting legitimised by the media frenzy. He said he was inspired by the popularity of a similar blog by Fake Steve Jobs, and the Richard Gere movie \"The Hoax\". He continues to write a weekly column as the Fake IPL Player for \"Mirror\", a \"Times of India\" tabloid in Mumbai and Bangalore.\n\nIn 2011, Anupam started Pitch Invasion, an online radio station that claims to provide live cricket commentary with a twist.\n\nDuring the IPL season, the blog was very popular in India and Sri Lanka and among major cricketing nations, most of whose players and coaches were involved in the league. According to Mumbai-based digital marketing firm, Pinstorm, the Fake IPL Player blog had at its peak, on 26 April, 150,000 visitors, who each spent 15 minutes on the site, adding up to about 37,000 hours spent on the blog in one day, putting it up there with popular individual-led blogs such as Aamir Khan’s blog at its peak with about 170,000 visitors.\n\nThe blogger said in an email interview to a newspaper that the key reason behind such wild popularity was the blog's \"audacity\", and that \"the mainstream media needs to realise that getting ex-cricketers to write about a match that happened the previous day, which has already been dissected to death on TV and the internet, isn’t of interest to sports readers anymore.\"\n\nIn March 2010 Fake IPL Player released a book called 'The Gamechangers' in India, coinciding with the third season of IPL, and loosely based on the contents of his blogs. This was before he had revealed his identity in August 2010. The book, which has been positioned as fiction written anonymously, covers 35 days of the Indian Bollywood League (IBL). The book describes the powerplays and machinations that go on behind the scenes of \"megabucks\" cricket. The central plot of the book is the chase to unmask a treacherous anonymous blogger who is upsetting the IPL. And through this story, FIP supposedly exposes cricket's dark underbelly. Critical reviews of the book were polarised with some praising it and some others criticising the book and its purpose. The 7 June 2010 issue of India Today put The Gamechangers at No. 9 in the list of Top 10 national best-sellers.\n\nIn April 2011, Anupam Mukerji started an online radio station called Pitch Invasion. Pitch Invasion claims to provide irreverent, wacky and interactive live cricket commentary on the web. Anupam also acts as the main station host.\n\nIn April 2013, Anupam launched Scoryboard, a live cricket web app, under the Pitch Invasion banner as reported here by Agency FAQs. In October, they launched Scoryboard's F1 version as reported here by daily newspaper DNA.\n\n"}

At the time of his death, Pollack held the distinction of being the only individual still working for the NBA since its inaugural 1946–47 season. Because of his proclivity to statistics, then \"Philadelphia Bulletin\" writer George Kiseda pinned the moniker of \"Super Stat\" on him in 1966.\n\nPollack played basketball for Simon Gratz High School and graduated in 1943 from Temple University in Philadelphia.\n\nHe took his first job as a sportswriter for the Philadelphia Bulletin after serving as a soldier in the United States Army during World War II. In 1946–47 he started as the assistant publicity director for the Philadelphia Warriors of the Basketball Association of America, which later merged with the National Basketball League to form the National Basketball Association. Midway through the 1952–53 season, he became head of media relations for the Warriors. The Warriors were sold by owner Ed Gottlieb (a founder of the NBA) and the team moved to San Francisco in 1962 (renamed Golden State Warriors), but Pollack remained in Philadelphia, where he worked for the NBA in various capacities until the 76ers were formed in 1963. Pollack then served as the media relations director of the Philadelphia 76ers until the 1987–88 season, when he assumed the duties of director of statistical information for the team.\n\nPollack holds the distinction of keeping score during Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game, on March 2, 1962. According to Pollack,it was the \"Busiest night of my career\" as there was no press. Thus, he was the statistician and sole reporter for the game. Pollack made Chamberlain the sign which he holds in his famous post-game photo. Pollack was responsible for many stats that are now officially recorded by the NBA, such as blocked shots, and he was the first statistician to separate rebounds into offensive and defensive. Some believe he coined the term \"triple-double,\" although others claim that it was coined by former Los Angeles Lakers public relations director, Bruce Jolesch.\nDuring the Sixers’ offseason, Pollack analyzed all 1,230 play-by-play sheets from the previous season (every game of the regular season) to produce the Harvey Pollack's NBA Statistical Yearbook, a book of rare basketball information that took statistical analysis to a new level. It includes stats such as the shot distance of every field goal, who gets their shot blocked the most, and other creative categories like \"working-man,\" which a player has to contribute to every category but no fouls or turnovers, and \"trillionaire club\" which is when player plays in a game and has all zeros across their name. This NBA publication evolved from developing the first of its kind media guides for the Philadelphia 76ers in 1966–67 and then separated later into a new NBA publication to become among the most distinguished compilations in the sports business.\n\nPollack claimed that Wilt Chamberlain had not only a quadruple-double, but also a game where he recorded at least double digits in all five primary statistical categories. However, this has not been recorded in the books because the NBA had not officially adopted the statistics yet.\n\nOn June 23, 2015, Pollack died at the age of 93.\n\n\n\n"}

It was renamed in 1987 in honor of chemicals entrepreneur and philanthropist Jon M. Huntsman father of Utah's former governor Jon Huntsman, Jr.\n\nFrom its opening until the completion of the Vivint Smart Home Arena in 1991 (as \"Delta Center\"), the Huntsman Center was one of Salt Lake City's premier sports and entertainment venues (along with the Salt Palace the home of the Utah Stars (ABA) and Utah Jazz (NBA)).\n\nArchitecturally, it was once known for its steel cloud, which hung from the arena's silver dome interior. The steel cloud held the arena's center court scoreboard, sound and lighting systems. The scoreboard was upgraded in the 1980s with the addition of state-of-the-art rear projection video screens. The rear projection system was upgraded in 1995, and replaced in 2006 by four LED video screens. In 2014, the arena was renovated again.

It hosted the West Regional Final twice (1971, 1981) and one Final Four (1979). Due to the frequency of hosting first and second round games, the Huntsman Center is third all-time in NCAA Tournament games hosted, with 81.\n\nSince 2010, NCAA tournament games in the city have been played at Vivint Smart Home Arena, home of the NBA's Utah Jazz. Other venues for past NCAA games in the state include the Marriott Center in Provo and the Dee Events Center in Ogden. \n\nThe arena hosted the 1979 Final Four, featuring the start of the rivalry between all-time greats Magic Johnson and Magic's Michigan State team defeated Bird's previously unbeaten Indiana State in the which remains the most-watched college basketball game in history.

The scheduled number of overs in List A cricket ranges from forty to sixty overs per side.\n\nThe categorisation of cricket matches as \"List A\" was not officially endorsed by the International Cricket Council until 2006, when the ICC announced that it and its member associations would be determining this classification in a manner similar to that done for first-class matches. The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians created this category for the purpose of providing an equivalent to first-class cricket, to allow the generation of career records and statistics for comparable one-day matches. Only the more important one-day competitions in each country, plus matches against a touring Test team, are included. The list was the work of Philip Bailey and the name is derived simply from there being a list A and a list B.\n\n\n\nThe first match retrospectively designated as a 'List A' game was played between Lancashire and Leicestershire in May 1963, in the preliminary round of the Gillette Cup.

{"id": "171554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171554", "title": "Rogers Centre", "text": "Rogers Centre\n\nRogers Centre, originally named SkyDome, is a multi-purpose stadium in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, situated just southwest of the CN Tower near the northern shore of Lake Ontario. Opened in 1989 on the former Railway Lands, it is home to the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). Previously, the stadium was home to the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL) played an annual game at the stadium as part of the Bills Toronto Series from 2008 to 2013. While it is primarily a sports venue, it also hosts other large events such as conventions, trade fairs, concerts, travelling carnivals, and monster truck shows.\n\nThe stadium was renamed \"Rogers Centre\" following the purchase of the stadium by Rogers Communications, which also owned the Toronto Blue Jays, in 2005. The venue was noted for being the first stadium to have a fully retractable motorized roof, as well as for the 348-room hotel attached to it, with 70 rooms overlooking the field. It is also the last North American major-league stadium built to accommodate both football and baseball. The stadium served as the site of both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2015 Pan American Games. During the ceremonies, the site was referred to as the \"Pan Am Dome\" (officially as the \"Pan Am Ceremonies Venue\") instead of its official name; Rogers Communications did not have sponsorship rights to the games.\n\nSkyDome, called Rogers Centre since 2005, was designed by architect Rod Robbie and structural engineer Michael Allen and was constructed by the EllisDon Construction company of London, Ontario and the Dominion Bridge Company of Lachine, Quebec. The stadium's construction lasted about two and a half years, from October 1986 to May 1989. The approximate cost of construction was C$570 million ($ in dollars) which was paid for by the federal government, Ontario provincial government, the City of Toronto, and a large consortium of corporations.\nThe main impetus for building an enclosed sports venue in Toronto came following the Grey Cup game in November 1982, held at the outdoor Exhibition Stadium. The game (in which the hometown Toronto Argonauts were making their first Grey Cup appearance since 1971) was played in a driving rainstorm that left most of the crowd drenched, leading the media to call it \"the Rain Bowl\". As many of the seats were completely exposed to the elements, thousands watched the game from the concession section. To make a bad experience even worse, the washrooms overflowed. In attendance that day was Bill Davis, the Premier of Ontario, and the poor conditions were seen by the largest TV audience ever in Canada (over 7,862,000 viewers) to that point. The following day, at a rally for the Argos at Toronto City Hall, tens of thousands of people who attended the game began to chant, \"We want a dome! We want a dome!\"\n\nSeven months later, in June 1983, Premier Davis formally announced a three-person committee would look into the feasibility of building a domed stadium at Exhibition Place. The committee consisted of Paul Godfrey, Larry Grossman and former Ontario Hydro chairman Hugh Macaulay.\n\nThe committee examined various projects, including a large indoor stadium at Exhibition Place with an air-supported dome, similar to BC Place in Vancouver. In 1985, an international design competition was launched to design a new stadium, along with selection of a site. Some of the proposed sites included Exhibition Place, Downsview Airport, and York University. The final site was at the base of the CN Tower not far from Union Station, a major railway and transit hub. The Railway Lands were a major Canadian National Railway rail switching yard encompassing the CNR Spadina Roundhouse (the desolate downtown lands were part of a master plan for revitalizing the area, which includes CityPlace). Ultimately, the Robbie/Allen concept won because it provided the largest roof opening of all the finalists, and it was the most technically sound.\n\nThe name \"SkyDome\" was chosen as part of a province-wide \"name the stadium\" contest in 1987. Sponsored by the \"Toronto Sun\", ballots were offered for people to submit their suggested name, with lifetime seats behind home plate to all events at the stadium (including concerts) as the prize. Over 150,000 entries were received with 12,897 different names. The selection committee narrowed it down to four choices: \"Towerdome\", \"Harbourdome\", \"SkyDome\", and simply \"the Dome\". The judges' final selection was SkyDome. Premier David Peterson drew the prize-winning entry of Kellie Watson from a lottery barrel containing the over-2,000 entries that proposed \"SkyDome\". At the press conference announcing the name, Chuck Magwood, president of the Stadium Corporation of Ontario (Stadco), the crown corporation created to run SkyDome, commented: \"The sky is a huge part of the whole roof process. The name has a sense of the infinite and that's what this is all about.\"\n\nThe stadium was funded by a public/private partnership, with the government paying the largest percentage of the tab. The initial cost of $150 million was greatly underestimated, with the final tab coming in at C$570 million ($ in dollars). Two levels of government (Metro Toronto and Provincial) each initially contributed $30 million ($ in dollars). This does not include the actual value of the land the stadium sits on (as it was part of a deal with the Crown agency – CN Rail). Canada's three main breweries (Labatt's, Molson, and Carling O'Keefe) and the Toronto Blue Jays each paid $5 million ($ in dollars) to help fund the stadium. An additional 26 other Canadian corporations (selected by invitation only) also contributed $5 million, for which they received one of the 161 Skyboxes with four parking spaces (for ten years, with an opportunity for renewal) and a 99-year exclusive option on stadium advertising. Skyboxes initially leased for $150,000 up to $225,000 ($ to $ in dollars) a year in 1989 – plus the cost of tickets for all events.\n\nThe then unusual financing structure created controversy. First of all, there was no public tender for supplies and equipment. Secondly, companies that paid the $5 million fee, such as Coca-Cola, TSN and CIBC, received 100% stadium exclusivity, including advertising rights, for the life of their contract that could be extended up to 99 years. Third, the contracts were not put up for bid, meaning there was some doubt the contracts were made at a market rate: Pepsi stated at the time that had they known the terms of the contract they would have paid far more than $5 million for the rights. Local media like \"NOW Magazine\" called the amount charged to the companies \"scandalously low\".\n\nConstruction was done by lead contractor EllisDon. Several factors complicated the construction: The lands housed a functioning water pumping station that needed to be relocated, the soil was contaminated from a century of industrial use, railway buildings needed to be torn down or moved, and the site was rich with archaeological finds. One of the most complex issues was moving the John Street pumping station across the street to its new home south of the stadium. Foundations to the stadium were being poured even as the facility (in the infield area) continued to function, as construction on its new location had yet to be completed.\n\nBecause the stadium was the first of its kind in the world, the architects and engineers kept the design simple (by using a sturdy dome shape) and used proven technologies to move the roof. It was important the design would work and be reliable as to avoid the various problems that plagued Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The 31-storey high roof consists of four panels; one (on the North end) is fixed in place and the other three are moved by electrically driven 'train' engines, that run on high strength railway rails. The roof, which takes 20 minutes to open, was made out of steel trusses covered by corrugated steel cladding, which in turn is covered by a single-ply PVC membrane.\n\nBecause of its location south of major railway corridor, new pedestrian connections had to be built; the infrastructure was part of the reason for the high cost of the stadium. The SkyWalk is an approximately 500-metre enclosed walkway that leads from the base of the CN Tower and via a bridge connects to Union Station (and is part of the PATH network). The John Street cable-stayed bridge was built to provide north–south passage over the rail tracks, linking Front Street with the stadium.\n\nThe stadium was completed two months late, having been planned to open for the first regular season Toronto Blue Jays game in 1989; the team played the first two months of their home schedule at Exhibition Stadium that year.\n\nThe stadium officially opened on June 3, 1989, and hosted an official grand opening show: \"The Opening of SkyDome: A Celebration\", broadcast on CBC television the following evening hosted by Brian Williams. With a crowd of over 50,000 in attendance, the event included appearances by Alan Thicke, Oscar Peterson, Andrea Martin of \"SCTV\", impersonator André-Philippe Gagnon and rock band Glass Tiger. The roof was ceremonially \"opened\" by Ontario Premier David Peterson with a laser pen. The roof's opening exposed the crowd to a downpour of rain. Despite audible chants of \"close the roof\", Magwood insisted the roof remain fully open.\n\nThe stadium became a thorn in the side of David Peterson's Ontario Liberal government for repeated cost overruns. After the Liberals were defeated by the NDP in the 1990 Ontario election, a review by the new Bob Rae government in October 1990 revealed Stadco's debt meant the Dome would have to be booked 600 days a year to turn a profit, almost twice as many days as there are days in a calendar year. The stadium income was only $17 million in its first year of operations, while debt service was $40 million. It was determined the abrupt late inclusion by Stadco of a hotel and health club added an additional $112 million to the cost of the building.\n\nAs the province slipped into a recession, Rae appointed University of Toronto professor Bruce Kidd and Canadian Auto Workers President Bob White to the Stadco board to help deal with the stadium's growing debt, but the original $165 million debt had ballooned to $400 million by 1993. Stadco became a political liability, and in March 1994, the Ontario government paid off all outstanding Stadco debts from the government treasury and sold the stadium for $151 million to a private consortium that included Labatt Breweries, the Blue Jays' owner.\n\nIn November 1998, the stadium, which Labatt then owned as 49% of total, filed for bankruptcy protection, triggered after disastrous Skybox renewal numbers. Most of the 161 Skybox tenants had signed on for 10-year leases; a marked decrease in interest in the stadium's teams and the construction of the Air Canada Centre, which hosted the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors, resulted in few renewals for Skybox leases. That same month, the Blue Jays re-signed for an additional ten years in the facility.\n\nIn April 1999, Sportsco International LP bought the stadium out of bankruptcy protection for $80 million.\n\nIn November 2004, Rogers Communications, parent company of the Blue Jays, acquired SkyDome, excluding the attached SkyDome hotel, which had been sold to Renaissance for a reported $31 million in 1999, from Sportsco for about $25 million – roughly 4% of the cost of construction.\n\nOn February 2, 2005, Ted Rogers, President and CEO of Rogers Communications, announced a three-year corporate contract to change the name of SkyDome to Rogers Centre. The name change remains controversial and is unpopular with many fans, most of whom continue to refer to it as SkyDome in opposition to increased commercialism from the purchase of naming rights. One example is a 25,000 name petition started by TTC bus driver Randy Rajmoolie. \n\nAfter the purchase Rogers refurbished the stadium by, among other things, replacing the Jumbotron with a Daktronics video display, and erecting other new monitors, including several built into the outfield wall. They also installed a new FieldTurf artificial playing surface.\n\nIn May 2005, the Toronto Argonauts agreed to three five-year leases at Rogers Centre, which could have seen the Argonauts play out of Rogers Centre up to and including 2019. The team had the option to leave at the end of each of the three lease agreements. Purposed plans to permanently lock Rogers Centre into its baseball configuration in order to install a natural grass surface forced the Argonauts to relocate to BMO Field before the 2016 season. However, it is now unclear whether the planned surface replacement and configuration change will take place, if at all, despite the Argonauts' departure.\n\nIn November 2005, Rogers Centre received a complete makeover to \"open\" the 100 Level concourse to the playing field and convert 43 luxury boxes to \"party suites\". This required some seats to be removed, which lowered overall capacity.\n\nIn April 2006, Rogers Centre became one of the first buildings of its size to adopt a completely smoke-free policy in Canada, anticipating an act of provincial legislature that required all Ontario public places to go smoke-free by June 1, 2006.\n\nAlcohol was not available to patrons of Rogers Centre on April 7, 2009, as the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario imposed the first of a three-day alcohol suspension at the stadium for \"infractions (that) took place at certain past events\", according to the press release.\n\nSignificant improvements to the facility since opening in 1989 include:\n\nThe venue was the first major team sports stadium in North America with a functional, fully retractable roof (Montreal's Olympic Stadium also had a retractable roof, but due to operational issues, it was replaced with a permanent roof). The roof is composed of four panels and covers an area of . The two middle panels slide laterally to stack over the north semi-circular panel, and then the south semi-circular panel rotates around the stadium and nests inside the stack. It takes 20 minutes for the roof to open or close. It is not possible to move the roof in cold weather because the mechanism that closes the roof could fail in cooler weather.\n\nThe original AstroTurf installation was replaced with FieldTurf from 2005 to 2010. The FieldTurf took about 40 hours to remove for events such as concerts or trade shows, as it used 1,400 trays that needed to be stacked and transported off the field. Prior to the 2010 baseball season, to reduce the amount of time required to convert the playing field, a new, roll-based version of AstroTurf was installed. Similar to FieldTurf, the installation uses a sand and rubber-based infill within the synthetic fibres. The Rogers Centre is one of two remaining venues in Major League Baseball using artificial turf (the other one is Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, home of the Tampa Bay Rays), and was the last venue to use \"sliding pits\" before switching to a full dirt infield for the 2016 baseball season. Before the Argonauts moved out, the pitcher's mound could be lowered or raised hydraulically when converting from baseball to football (or vice versa).\n\nThe use of natural grass was long thought unfeasible since the stadium was designed as a closed structure with a roof that opens, and as such, the interior was not intended or built to deal with weather, including low temperatures and drainage. As of the 2016 season, they are one of two teams to have never played a home game on grass at their main stadium (the Tampa Bay Rays played some home games in 2007 and 2008 at Champion Stadium in Walt Disney World).\nHowever, the Blue Jays have long explored the possibility of converting the Rogers Centre to a natural grass surface, and plans are in place to install a grass field by 2018 to allow enough time for research and growing of the sod. Installing grass would require digging up the floor, adding a drainage system, and installing of dirt. The stadium would need to be permanently locked into its baseball configuration; the lower stands, which roll into position for football, would be permanently fixed in position for baseball. The plan became more definite when Rogers renewed the Argonauts' lease through 2017, but ruled out any further extensions; in May 2015, it was announced the Argos would move to BMO Field for the 2016 season. The Blue Jays subsequently confirmed the Argonauts' early departure would not accelerate their own plans to install grass in 2018, though it did allow for a dirt infield to be installed for the 2016 season. However, it does not appear likely the field will be converted to natural grass, as no further announcements for replacing the surface have been made since, and the field continues to retain its artificial surface.\n\nThere are a total of 5,700 club seats and 161 luxury suites at the Rogers Centre. The complex had a Hard Rock Café restaurant until December 2009 when the restaurant closed after its lease expired. The Renaissance Toronto Hotel is also within Rogers Centre, with 70 rooms overlooking the field.\n\nOver $5 million of artwork was commissioned in 1989 ($(/10) million in dollars):\n\nThe Rogers Centre video board is high and across. The panel is made up of modular LED units that can be replaced unit by unit, and can be repaired immediately should it be damaged during an event. Originally, this screen was a Sony JumboTron, which was, at the time the stadium opened, the largest in North America, but since has been replaced. There are also two ribbon boards made up of LED that run along the East and West sides of the stadium interior. They are each long by high. In addition, there are two video boards that make up parts of the left and right outfield walls while in baseball configuration. These are wide by nearly high.\n\nThe video board and the stadium played host to several serial television events, including the series finales for \"Cheers\" and \"\", along with live coverage of the funeral of Princess Diana.\n\nThe 1992 World Series and 1993 World Series were played at the SkyDome. The stadium also hosted the 1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The 1991 American League Championship Series was the first Major League Baseball playoff series played entirely indoors, with the first two games at the Metrodome and the final three at the SkyDome.\n\nGames in the first round of the 2009 World Baseball Classic were played at the Rogers Centre.\n\nBesides baseball, Rogers Centre was the original home of the National Basketball Association's Toronto Raptors, who played at the venue from November 1995 to February 1999, while the Air Canada Centre was being planned and built. It proved to be somewhat problematic as a basketball venue, even considering it was only a temporary facility. For instance, many seats that were theoretically in line with the court were so far away fans needed binoculars to see the action. Other seats were so badly obstructed that fans sitting there could only watch the game on the replay boards. For most games, Rogers Centre seated 22,900 people. However, the Raptors sometimes opened the upper level when popular opponents came to town, such as the Chicago Bulls when Michael Jordan was a member of the team, expanding capacity to 29,000.\n\nRogers Centre hosted Canadian football from opening in 1989 to 2015, as the Argonauts moved to BMO Field in 2016. In November 2007, it hosted the 95th Grey Cup, its first since 1992 and third all-time. It was the 56th Grey Cup hosted by the city of Toronto since the championship's inception in 1909.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2003, SkyDome hosted the Vanier Cup championship of Canadian Interuniversity Sport (now U Sports) football.\n\nIn 1994, then-part owner of SkyDome Labatt considered purchasing a National Football League and a Major League Soccer team to play at the stadium.\n\nIn January 2007, Rogers Centre played host to the first ever International Bowl, an NCAA college football game between the Western Michigan University Broncos and the University of Cincinnati Bearcats. In 2008, Rutgers played Ball State in the second International Bowl. The University at Buffalo Bulls and the University of Connecticut Huskies played in the third International Bowl on January 3, 2009.\n\nRogers Centre was also the venue for the 43rd Vanier Cup on Friday November 23, just two days before Grey Cup Sunday. It was the 16th Vanier Cup hosted at the venue, returning after a three-year absence in which it was hosted by Hamilton, Ontario (2004 and 2005) and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (2006). It was the 40th Vanier Cup hosted by Toronto since that championship's inception in 1965.\n\nThe National Football League's Buffalo Bills announced its intentions to play five \"home\" games (and three pre-season games) in Rogers Centre in October 2007, so beginning the Bills Toronto Series; the first of these regular-season games took place on December 7 of the 2008 NFL season versus the Miami Dolphins. It marked the first time an NFL team has established a \"home\" stadium outside the United States. The Bills played a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Rogers Centre on August 14, 2008; the Toronto Series was played every year through the 2013 season.\n\nFrom the mid-2000s, soccer matches have been regularly held in SkyDome/Rogers Centre; they had been rarely played at the venue when its AstroTurf surface had been in place.\n\nOn June 8, 2005 an international soccer friendly between Serbia and Italy took place, ending in a 1–1 draw.\n\nOn May 25, 2010, the stadium hosted a friendly soccer match between Italy's ACF Fiorentina and Juventus F.C. with Fiorentina winning 1–0.\n\nOn July 16, 2010, the stadium hosted a friendly soccer match between England's Manchester United F.C. and Scotland's Celtic F.C. Manchester United F.C. defeated Celtic F.C. with a score of 3–1. The match was played on a temporary grass surface harvested from Burford, Ontario and transported via 18 tractor-trailers.\n\nOn July 21, 2012, the stadium hosted the friendly between Toronto FC and Liverpool F.C., a match that finished in a 1–1 draw.\n\nRogers Centre has also hosted exhibition cricket, gaelic football, hurling, Australian rules football and tennis.\n\nIt hosted the 1993 IAAF World Indoor Championships.\n\nOn May 31, 1997, the venue hosted a post-Olympic track and field event that pitted Olympic track champions Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson, in a 150 m race billed as a competition for the title of the \"World's Fastest Man\". Bailey won the race, completing it in a time of 15 seconds and winning the $1.5 million prize. Johnson pulled up lame at the 110 m mark claiming a quadriceps injury.\n\nRogers Centre is the site of several major high school and collegiate sporting competitions, such as the Prentice Cup for baseball. Since 2008, the Rogers Centre is the host of the Greater Toronto high schools' Metro Bowl.\n\nIt hosted a round of the AMA Supercross Championship from 2008 to 2014 and returned for 2016 and 2017. Monster Jam hosts an annual event in the month of January.\n\nOn April 30, 2011, Ultimate Fighting Championship hosted their first event in Ontario's history, UFC 129. Originally set up for 42,000 seats, the event sold out on the first day of ticket sales. Changes were made to accommodate another 13,000 seats. Fans responded bringing the total seat sales to 55,000 — breaking previous UFC records.\n\nFor the 2015 Pan American Games, the Rogers Centre was used for the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nThe World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) staged WrestleMania VI and WrestleMania X8 at Rogers Centre in 1990 and 2002. As well, the WWF/WWE held its largest crowd for \"Monday Night Raw\" on February 13, 1999, when 41,432 attended a special edition of Raw called \"Raw Saturday Night\". Wrestlemania VI held on April 1, 1990, with the main event being a title vs title match which saw the WWF Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior defeat the WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, set the SkyDome attendance record of 67,678. The attendance record was broken when 68,237 attended Wrestlemania X8 on March 17, 2002.\n\nThe stadium has several concert configurations, including smaller \"Theatre\" (capacity 5,000 to 7,000) and \"Concert Hall\" (formerly \"SkyTent\"; capacity 10,000 to 25,000). Due to the stadium's design and building materials, the acoustics are poor, and the loudness/quality can vary greatly around the stadium. Its popularity with artists and fans has diminished over the years, and the Scotiabank Arena now hosts most major concerts The SkyTent, a group of acoustical curtain sails hoisted on rigging above the floor, helps reduce sound distortion and improve sound quality by dampening reverberations around the stadium.\n\nSoon after its opening, the stadium became a popular venue for large-scale rock concerts and is the largest indoor concert venue in Toronto. Artists have included Bruce Springsteen, U2 with two concerts in 2009, as well as their concert in 2011, all part of their 360° Tour. Bon Jovi performed two sellout shows on July 20 and 21, 2010 at Rogers Centre as part of The Circle Tour.\n\nThe Rolling Stones played two sold out concerts at the stadium: on December 4, 1989 during the Steel Wheels Tour and on September 26, 2005 during their highest grossing tour A Bigger Bang Tour. Rogers Centre has been a venue for large electronic dance music events. During 2013, notable events included two back to back sold out shows on Swedish House Mafia's farewell tour, One Last Tour and Sensation's first Canadian event. One of the more notable concerts, as shown in the documentary \"\", was Madonna's 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour show.

There is a line across the centre that backs and forwards can not cross. Onballers are allowed to go anywhere. Forwards can only operate in their attacking half, the backs in their defensive half. Like Gaelic football, players are permitted to bounce the ball only once while running, in order to encourage kicking.\n\nThe game is played on rugby union fields, sometimes a single one, or two side by side. This means the pitch is rectangular, rather than oval, like an Australian football field.\n\nThe Vailima Six-Shooters' Championship began in Samoa in 1998 under these rules, becoming known as Samoa rules. A number of Samoa rules players went on to represent Samoa in the Samoan national Australian rules football team.\n\n"}

The film is centered on former Chicago Cubs third baseman Ron Santo and both his playing days and his battle against diabetes. The film was written, co-produced, and directed by Santo's son Jeff. It is often mentioned during Cub game broadcasts by Pat Hughes, who was Santo's partner in the WGN Radio booth. The film was a gift from Jeff to his father as a part of the \"Ron Santo Day\" celebration that season after Santo had both his legs amputated and had just missed induction into the MLB Hall of Fame a few months earlier. A portion of all proceeds from the release of \"This Old Cub\" are donated to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. The film has raised over a half-million dollars for the JDRF. Cub shortstop Ernie Banks, Gary Sinise, Bill Murray, former Chicago Bears linebacker Doug Buffone, and many others are interviewed in the film, which is narrated by actor Joe Mantegna.\n\nThe documentary inspired an Arizona teacher and lifelong Cub fan named Bill Holden to engage a 2100-mile walk from Arizona to Wrigley Field to raise funds for the JDRF. Holden covered at least 12 miles each day, crossed six states, and battled his arthritis during the nearly seven-month trek. Followed by the media, Holden arrived at Wrigley on July 1, 2005 where he threw out the first pitch and joined Santo in singing \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\". The venture raised over $250,000 for the charity, and caused a dramatic spike in sales of the DVD. Derek Schaul, the leader of Chicago Cubs Bleacher Bums, wears a shirt to every game stating, \"I walk for the cure because Ronnie can't! Go Cubbies!\"\n\n\"This Old Cub\" was co-produced by Walgreens Drug Stores and the \"Chicago Tribune\", both heavy sponsors of the JDRF.\n\n\n"}
