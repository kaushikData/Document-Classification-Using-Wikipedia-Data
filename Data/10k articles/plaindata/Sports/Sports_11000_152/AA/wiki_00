Chuck protests the existence of nuclear weapons by refusing to play baseball, which results in the forfeit of a Little League game by his team.\n\n\"Amazing Grace\" Smith, a fictional Boston Celtics player (played by NBA star Alex English), catches a blurb about the story in his newspaper and decides to emulate Chuck, saying he will no longer participate in professional basketball unless there are no more nuclear weapons. This gives it nationwide coverage, inspiring more pro athletes to join the protest against nuclear weapons. Smith then moves to Montana to meet with Chuck and buys an old barn, which he and the other athletes renovate into their residence.

Bloch began making pointe shoes in a workshop in Paddington, Sydney in 1932, when he noticed a ballet dancer struggling to stay en pointe and offered to make her an improved pair of shoes. Later, he made custom ballet shoes for Tamara Toumanova, David Lichine, Helene Kirsova, and other visiting Russian ballet dancers. With the expanding popularity of his product, Bloch began selling his pointe shoes throughout Australia.\n\nThe company has since expanded its product line with the addition of dance and street apparel and accessories. Today, Bloch's corporate headquarters are located in Sydney, Australia, with a European head office in London. It operates one flagship store and 14 other stores across Australia, European stores in London, Paris, Amsterdam,Warsaw and one US store in New York; all other sales are conducted through independent retailers.\n\nBloch manufactures various types of shoes including pointe shoes, ballet flats, jazz shoes, character and tap shoes, ballroom shoes, dance sneakers, barre shoes and fashion flats, as well as a wide range of dance apparel, gymnastics and activewear.\n\nBloch employs a pointe shoe manufacturing method known as turnshoe. Bloch pointe shoes use three different recipes of paste in the toe box. The standard paste, \"paste A\", is a firm, hard paste, that was formulated to withstand varying heat and humidity. \"Paste B\" is more malleable and thus allows the shoe to more quickly mold to the shape of the foot; because of its high malleability, this paste breaks down (i.e., shoe structural support degrades) faster than paste A. A third recipe, known as \"TMT™\" or \"Thermo-Morph Technology\" paste, is a heat activated material that allows the shoe to be molded to the foot when subjected to directed hot air from a hair dryer.\n\n"}

Within a few years financial problems resulted in the property reverting to Joseph Duggan, the original land owner and retired innkeeper. In the early 1880s Duggan founded the Ontario Jockey Club (OJC). The facility hosted seasonal harness racing for Standardbred horses and flat racing events for Thoroughbreds.\n\nHarness racing dates were transferred from Thorncliffe Park Raceway to Old Woodbine to fill the gap between the spring and fall thoroughbred meets, and the track was known as Greenwood Raceway during the harness meet. The track was at the junction of Kingston Road and Queen Street East, with only a narrow strip of land between it and Lake Ontario. Thoroughbred racing continued at Old Woodbine on a shortened six furlong (1,207 m) track. Harness races were at first conducted on the thoroughbred track, but serious problems with mud (including the starting gate being immobilized) led to the construction of a five-furlong (1006 m) stone dust harness track inside the thoroughbred track. This track was known for its tight turns and long back and homestretches.\n\nIn the early 1950s, the Ontario Jockey Club, led by directors E. P. Taylor, George C. Hendrie and J. E. Frowde Seagram, undertook an acquisition and consolidation program for southern Ontario racing. By 1956, the OJC operated just three facilities consisting of the Fort Erie Racetrack in Fort Erie, Ontario and two facilities in Toronto. A new facility for thoroughbred horse races was constructed in Toronto, and given the name Woodbine Racetrack. The Old Woodbine facility was completely renovated and renamed Greenwood Raceway in 1963. It held both harness racing and thoroughbred racing meets until its closure at the end of 1993.\n\nSteeplechase races were held at Woodbine/Greenwood for a few years; There was a thoroughbred race announcer by the name of Foster \"Buck\" Dryden for several years.\n\nA horse by the name of Last Mark, owned by James G. Fair of Cainsville, Ontario won the \"Plate\" in 1948, setting a new Plate record and only being equalled once, before the track was decommissioned. R.J. Speers' horse, Lord Fairmond came 2nd in that Plate race. Fair had 2 horses in that Plate which never ran in the Plate Trials but worked out between the 2 divisions of the \"Trials\". Their times were faster than the times of either of the trial divisions.\n\nGreenwood Raceway was the site of the Canadian Pacing Derby, the North America Cup, the Fan Hanover Stakes, the Maple Leaf Trot, and the Canadian Trotting Classic.\n\nIn 1994, the thoroughbred and harness operations were moved to Woodbine. The stadium was demolished and replaced by residential and commercial development, including a betting parlour. Half of the property became Woodbine Park. To commemorate the history of the site, two of the new residential roadways were given names that reflected horse racing themes: Northern Dancer Blvd. (in honour of the famous thoroughbred Northern Dancer) and Winners Circle—a street which, paradoxically, runs in a straight line. Joseph Duggan Road was named after the historical landowner and Sarah Ashbridge Avenue commemorated another pioneer resident of the area.\n\nIn 2016, it was announced that Live Nation Entertainment had purchased the other half of the property, known as the Greenwood Off Track Wagering or Champions Greenwood, with the intent of repurposing the site into a medium-sized entertainment venue with a capacity of 2,700 attendees.\n\n"}

{"id": "501845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=501845", "title": "Jawi alphabet", "text": "Jawi alphabet\n\nJawi (Jawi: \"Jāwī\"; Pattani: \"Yawi\"; Acehnese: \"Jawoë\") is an Arabic alphabet for writing Malay, Acehnese, Banjarese, Minangkabau, Tausūg and several other languages in Southeast Asia.\n\nJawi is one of the two official scripts in Brunei and is used as an alternative script in Malaysia and Malay-dominated areas in Indonesia. It used to be the standard script for the Malay language but has since been replaced by a Latin alphabet, called \"Rumi\" (lit: Roman). Jawi has since been relegated to a script used for religious, cultural and some administrative purposes.\n\nJawi can be typed with the Jawi keyboard. Its day-to-day usage is maintained in the more-conservative Malay-populated areas such as Kelantan in Malaysia and Pattani.\n\nThe word \"Jawi\" (جاوي) is an adjective for the Arabic noun \"Jawah\" (جاوة). Both terms may have originated from the term \"Javadwipa\", the ancient name for Java. \"Jawah\" and \"Jawi\" may have been used by the Arabs as the catch-all terms in referring to the entire Maritime Southeast Asia and its peoples, similar to the kind of understanding by the later Europeans when coining the terms Malay Archipelago and Malay race.\n\nPrior to the onset of the Islamisation, when Hindu-Buddhist influences were still firmly established in the region, the Pallava script was primarily used in writing Malay language. This is evidenced from the discovery of several stone inscriptions in Old Malay, notably the Kedukan Bukit Inscription and Talang Tuwo inscription. The spread of Islam in Southeast Asia and the subsequent introduction of Arabic writing system began with the arrival of Muslim merchants in the region since the seventh century. Among the oldest archaeological artefacts inscribed with Arabic script are; a tombstone of Syeikh Rukunuddin dated 48 AH (668/669 CE) in Barus, Sumatra; a tombstone dated 290 AH (910 CE) on the mausoleum of Syeikh Abdul Qadir Ibn Husin Syah Alam located in Alor Setar, Kedah; a tombstone found in Pekan, Pahang dated 419 AH (1026 CE); a tombstone discovered in Phan Rang, Vietnam dated 431 AH (1039 CE); a tombstone dated 440 AH (1048 CE) found in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei; and a tombstone of Fatimah Binti Maimun Bin Hibat Allah found in Gresik, East Java dated 475 AH (1082 CE). Islam was spread from the coasts to the interior of the island and generally in a top-down process in which rulers were converted and then introduced more or less orthodox versions of Islam to their peoples. The conversion of King Phra Ong Mahawangsa of Kedah in 1136 and King Merah Silu of Samudra Pasai in 1267 were among the earliest examples.\n\nAt the early stage of Islamisation, the Arabic script was taught to the people who had newly embraced Islam in the form of religious practices, such as the recitation of Quran as well as salat. It is not too far-fetched to say that the Arabic script was accepted by the Malay community together with their acceptance of Islam and they didn't took long to modify the script and adapt it to suit the spoken Classical Malay – it is written from right to left and has 6 sounds not found in Arabic: \"ca\" \"pa\" \"ga\" \"nga\" \"va\" and \"nya\". Many Arabic characters are never used as they are not pronounced in Malay language, and some letters are never joined and some joined obligatorily so. This was the same for the acceptance of Arabic writing in Turkey, Persia and India which had taken place earlier and thus, the Jawi script was then deemed as the writing of the Muslims.\n\nThe oldest remains of Malay using the Jawi script have been found on the Terengganu Inscription Stone, dated 702 AH (1303 CE), nearly 600 years after the date of the first recorded existence of Arabic script in the region. The inscription on the stone contains a proclamation issued by the \"Sri Paduka Tuan\" of Terengganu, urging his subjects to \"extend and uphold\" Islam and providing 10 basic Sharia laws for their guidance. This has attested the strong observance of the Muslim faith in the early 14th century Terengganu specifically and the Malay world as a whole.\n\nThe development of Jawi script was different from that of Pallava writing which was exclusively restricted to the nobility and monks in monasteries. The Jawi script was embraced by the entire Muslim community regardless of class. With the increased intensity in the appreciation of Islam, scriptures originally written in Arabic were translated in Malay and written in the Jawi script. Additionally local religious scholars later began to elucidate the Islamic teachings in the forms of original writings. Moreover, there were also individuals of the community who used Jawi for the writing of literature which previously existed and spread orally. With this inclusion of written literature, Malay literature took on a more sophisticated form. This was believed to have taken place from the 15th century and lasted right up to the 19th century.\nOther forms of Arabic-based scripts existed in the region, notably the Pegon alphabet of Javanese language in Java and the Serang alphabet of Bugis language in South Sulawesi. Both writing systems applied extensively the Arabic diacritics and added several letters other than Jawi letters to suit the languages. Due to their fairly limited usage, the spelling system of both scripts did not undergo similar advance developments and modifications as experienced by Jawi script.\n\nThe script became prominent with the spread of Islam, as the Malays found that the earlier Pallava script was totally unsuited as a vehicle to relay religious concepts. The Malays held the script in high esteem as it is the gateway to understanding Islam and its Holy Book, the Quran. The use of jawi script was a key factor driving the emergence of Malay as the lingua franca of the region, alongside the spread of Islam. It was widely used in the Sultanate of Malacca, Sultanate of Johor, Sultanate of Brunei, Sultanate of Sulu, Sultanate of Pattani, the Sultanate of Aceh to the Sultanate of Ternate in the east as early as the 15th century. The jawi script was used in royal correspondences, decrees, poems and was widely understood by the merchants in the port of Malacca as the main means of communication. Early legal digests such as the \"Undang-Undang Melaka\" Code and its derivatives including the Codes of Johor, Perak, Brunei, Kedah, Pattani and Aceh were written in this script. It is the medium of expression of kings, nobility and the religious scholars. It is the traditional symbol of Malay culture and civilisation. Jawi was used not only amongst the ruling class, but also the common people. The Islamisation and Malayisation of the region popularised Jawi into a dominant script.\n\nRoyal correspondences for example are written, embellished and ceremoniously delivered. Examples of royal correspondences still in the good condition are the letter between Sultan Hayat of Ternate and King John III of Portugal (1521) ; the letter from Sultan Iskandar Muda of Acèh Darussalam to King James I of England (1615); the letter from Sultan Abdul Jalil IV of Johor to King Louis XV of France (1719). Many literary works such as epics, poetry and prose use the Jawi script. It is the pinnacle of the classic Malay civilisation. Historical epics such as the \"Malay Annals\", as listed by UNESCO under Memories of the World, are among the countless epics written by the Malay people. The Sufic poems by Hamzah Fansuri and many others contributed to the richness and depth of the Malay civilisation. Jawi script was the official script for Unfederated Malay States during British protectorate.\n\nToday, Jawi is an official script of Brunei. In Malaysia, it is used for religious and cultural administration in the states of Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah, Perlis, Penang and Johor. Various efforts were in place to revive the Jawi script in Malaysia and Brunei due to its role in the Malay and Islamic spheres. Jawi scripts are also seen at the rear of Malaysian ringgit and Brunei dollar banknotes. The Malays in Patani still use Jawi today for the same reasons.\n\nIndonesia, having multiple regional and native languages, uses the Indonesian language in general. Nonetheless, the Jawi script does have a regional status in native Malay areas in Indonesia such as Riau, Riau archipelago, Jambi, Aceh, or Kalimantan (example the Banjar language). This is partially due to the fact that regional/native languages are compulsory studies in the basic education curriculum of each region (examples include Javanese for Javanese region, Sundanese for Sundanese region, Madurese for Maduranese region, and jawi for Malay region). Today Jawi script is widely used in Riau and Riau Island province, where road signs and government buildings signs are written in this script. It is still widely used in traditional religious school across Java, however, in the form of Pegon script, a variant of it, and is not used in common writing when the Latin alphabet and in some cases the Javanese script.\n\n\nModern Jawi spelling is based on the \"Daftar Kata Bahasa Melayu\" (DKBM)\": Rumi-Sebutan-Jawi\" dictionary. Older texts may use different spellings for some words. Nonetheless, even different modern sources may use different spelling conventions; they may differ especially in the usage of the mater lectionis (\"alif\" \"ا\", \"wau\" \"و\" and \"ya\" \"ي\") and the \"3/4 hamzah\" \"\", as well as in the spelling of vowels and consonant clusters in loanwords from English. One source tends to use the following conventions; there are numerous exceptions to them nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkin to the Arabic script, Jawi is constructed from right-to-left. Below is an exemplification of the Jawi script extracted from the first and second verse of the notable \"Ghazal untuk Rabiah\"; \"غزال اونتوق ربيعة\" (English: A Ghazal for Rabiah).\n\n\n"}

It resembles the modern pentathlon but updated to skills used by the modern military.\n\nThe modern pentathlon was originally designed to include the ideal skills of a soldier of the time. By the Second World War, some of those skills (fencing and horse riding) were irrelevant to the modern soldier.\n\nIn 1946 a French officer, Captain Henri Debrus (later promoted Colonel and President of the Conseil International du Sport Militaire (CISM)) conceived the idea of organising a sports competition reserved exclusively for the army. It was during discussions held at Frankfurt am Main which led to the setting up of the Allied Forces Sports Council, that his attention was drawn to an original military physical training technique used, at that time, by the Netherlands airborne units. After being dropped over a given zone, parachutists had to travel a distance of twenty kilometres from the dropping point, crossing over a number of obstacles and performing combat operations (small arms fire and grenade throwing).\n\nCaptain Debrus took the Dutch method as a guide, eliminated the parachute jump and modified the other tests in order to form a system, which he thought, would constitute an ideal way of ground training. A first trial competition organised by himself was held at the Military Physical Training Centre, at Freiburg, in the French occupation zone in Germany, in August 1947. Only Belgian, Dutch, and French teams took part in the competition.\n\nSince 1950, annual world championships have been held. The sport has grown in popularity, and now over 30 countries participate. The sport's governing body, the CISM, now also organise pentathlons aimed at naval and air force personnel.\n\n\nThe shooting discipline consists of sighting shots and competition shooting.\n\nThe competition shooting consists of:\n\nThe length of the course is 500 meters and consists of 20 standardised obstacles.\n\nThe contest is to be held on one or several lanes, provided that all lanes are identical. Each competitor is compelled to follow his own lane.\n\nObstacles: The obstacles are constructed and placed on the track. Obstacles of men's event consist of:\n\nIn the women's event, the rope ladder, sloping wall with rope, four steps of beams and vertical ladder are not negotiated.\n\n50 meters with four obstacles.\n\nThe weight of projectiles is 575 grams (weight tolerance +/- 25 grams) for men and 375 grams (weight tolerance +/- 25 grams) for women.\n\nThrowing consists of precision throwing at distances of 20, 25, 30 and 35 meters (five meters shorter for each target for females). The targets consist of an inner circle with radius of one meter, and an outer circle with radius of two meters. The time allotted for precision throwing is three minutes, 16 projectiles with four inactive grenades on each target.\n\nDistance throwing is also included, where competitors throw three grenades in two minutes. Only the longest throw will count toward the score, which combines points for both distance and precision.\n\nThe cross-country running is the last event and for men the distance is 8000m and for women the distance is 4000m.\n\n"}

Originally intended to debut on the calendar in , the race was subject to a series of postponements and delays stemming from financial difficulties, failure to obtain approval from the FIA, a lack of preparedness from organisers, and a contractual dispute.\n\nWhen the inaugural 2013 race was dropped from the calendar, Formula One President and CEO Bernie Ecclestone stated that the promoters were in breach of contract and that new proposals from other parties would be welcome. The race was repeatedly added then removed from future Formula One provisional calendars, and dropped completely from even the provisional calendar by .\n\nIn 2014, Formula E chief executive Alejandro Agag revealed that he had been working with promoters to bring that series to the proposed Port Imperial Circuit, but later (2016) settled on a circuit in the Brooklyn industrial area instead after the continued failure to launch the Formula One race.\n\nThe site of the circuit was made after several years of searching for an appropriate venue in the New York Metropolitan Area and was chosen for its location near the Hudson River and Hudson Palisades, offering sweeping skyline views, elevation changes and access to public transportation.\n\nThe circuit, designed by German track designer Hermann Tilke, will run clockwise. The start line is planned to be located next to the NY Waterway ferry terminal, with the pits and paddock located between the ferry terminal and Port Imperial Boulevard. The first sector of the circuit will run along the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway, designed to allow the cars to race through Port Imperial before climbing the Hudson Palisades along Pershing Road. The circuit will then follow Boulevard East north to Donnelly Memorial Park where it will turn right and descend Hillside Avenue to a hairpin turn adjacent to the West New York sewage treatment plant. The circuit will then return south to the ferry terminal via Port Imperial Boulevard. The elevation change from Port Imperial to the Palisades, some , would give the circuit one of the greatest elevation changes on the calendar.\n\nAlthough the circuit will pass residential areas, residents will not be cut off from their homes; the organizers plan to provide access to the seven affected residences. The organizers further plan to fund the race without any public money.\n\nIn June 2012, Sebastian Vettel did a promotional test run along the proposed route describing it as \"exceptional\" before going on to add that it would become a favourite among drivers. Commenting on the elevation changes and turns he said he was reminded of the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps and the Circuit de Monaco. According to Vettel, the circuit will be made up of \"quick, floating corners\", and he expects cars will reach speeds of over 200 mph, with the net result being that the circuit will reward the bravest drivers.\nIn August 2012, David Coulthard drove portions of the course to test out the roadways as part of the creation of a promotional video for Red Bull Racing featuring the street circuit and environs.\n\nEvent organiser Leo Hindery announced in June 2013 that the race has received all necessary local permits and that 31 contractors were engaged in preparation work for the course. The circuit will consist entirely of existing roads, removing the need to build any sections of circuit exclusively for the race, with the exception of the pit lane. A contract between the municipalities and the race promoters was signed in June 2013. That month, a long-awaited bridge between the building and the Port Imperial Hudson–Bergen Light Rail station, seen as an important component of public access to the circuit was opened.\n\nConstruction of a previously planned parking garage at the NY Waterway ferry terminal began in July 2012, which is intended for use as race headquarters and paddock, with space for twenty-four pit garages. As envisioned, the ground floor of the building will normally function as retail space, to be transformed each year for use by the race. Construction was completed in the Summer of 2013. In November 2013 ground was broken for two hotels to be built above the parking facility.\n\nResurfacing and other work on the roads to be used was planned for August to November 2013. In order to create a smooth surface, repaving was to be done in a staggered line or \"echelon\" so that asphalt will not cool as lanes are poured. It remained to be determined whether potential obstacles such as fire hydrants and traffic lights would have been moved.\n\nIt was considered for the barriers used for the defunct Valencia Street Circuit to be used for the circuit.\nAccording to a March 2014 report in \"Forbes\", Formula E chief executive Alejandro Agag revealed that he had been working with promoters to bring the series to the New York area, but that he was waiting to see how the financial situation surrounding the Grand Prix was resolved before he could commit to bringing the Formula E series to the city. With the continued failure to launch the Formula One race, with associated development of the Port Imperial Street Circuit, Agag later (2016) settled on a circuit that will utilize the Brooklyn industrial area instead.\n\n"}
{"id": "10966805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10966805", "title": "Portuguese-style bullfighting", "text": "Portuguese-style bullfighting\n\nPortuguese-style bullfighting differs in many aspects from Spanish-style bullfighting. The \"cavaleiros\" and the \"forcados\" are unique as well as the horsewomen (\"cavaleiras\").\n\n\nMost Portuguese bullfights (\"corridas de touros\") are held in two phases: the spectacle of the \"cavaleiro\", followed by the \"pega\". In Portugal, the main stars of bullfighting are the \"cavaleiros\", as opposed to Spain, where the \"matadores\" are the most prominent bullfighters. Nevertheless, bullfights with matadores are frequent, notably with Portuguese matadores who practice their trade in Spain and who, when in Portugal, replace the sword in their final strike with a \"bandarilha\". Examples of famous Portuguese matadores are Vítor Mendes and Pedrito de Portugal.\n\nDuring the \"cavaleiro\", a horseman on a Portuguese Lusitano horse (specially trained for the fights) fights the bull from horseback. The purpose of this fight is to stab three or four \"bandeirilhas\" (small javelins) in the back of the bull.\nIn the second stage, called the \"pega\", the forcados, a group of eight men, challenge the bull directly without any protection or weapon of defense. The front man provokes the bull into a charge to perform a \"pega de cara\" or \"pega de caras\" (face catch). The front man secures the animal's head and is quickly aided by his fellows who surround and secure the animal until he is subdued. Many people who watch Portuguese-style bullfights in the United States use the term, \"suicide squad\", to refer to this group of eight men.\n\nThe bull is not killed, at the end of the \"corrida\", leading oxen are let into the arena and two \"campinos\" on foot herd the bull along them back to its pen. After the fight the bull may be either killed by a professional butcher or, after a good performance, restored to health and released to pasture for breeding. Nevertheless, tradition was so strong at the small frontier town of Barrancos, where the bull was illegally killed, that the government was forced to relent and permit the town to follow its ancient \"matador\" tradition and kill the bull.\n\nThere are other forms of traditional bullfighting in Portugal, some differing markedly from the version described above. In the Azores, bullfighting is often reminiscent of the running of the bulls in Pamplona (Spain) in the respect that those most at risk are human beings, not the bulls themselves. The Azorean style involves a group of people vying in a tug-of-war with a young bull by holding fast to a long stout rope tied around the bull's neck. This is called the \"tourada à corda\" (bull-on-a-rope 'game').\n\nIn Portugal, some bulls have their horns severed and covered in a way that they do not present sharp points. This practice is believed to have been introduced by King Joseph I of Portugal after a tragic event in a bullfight over which he was presiding at Salvaterra de Magos. The son and heir of the 4th Marquis of Marialva was fighting a bull on horseback when the animal wounded his horse. The young man fell, was kicked by the bull and killed. The Marquis himself, then around 70 years of age, jumped from the royal cabin that he shared with the king, drew his sword and killed the animal.\n\nSome southern and central regions of Portugal, such as Ribatejo and parts of the Alentejo, as well as Terceira Island in the Azores, are traditionally more interested in the \"corrida de touros\". In Portugal's northern regions, bullfighting has a much lower presence, except for Póvoa de Varzim where bullfighting arenas are known to exist, at various locations, since the 18th century. In Northern Portugal, Viana do Castelo prohibited bullfighting in 2009, However, the arena was only used once a year since the 1990s and its bullfighting locations can be traced to 1871. In July 2018, the Póvoa de Varzim municipality has also announced a bullfighting ban, starting January 1 2019. It is entirely absent from most Azorean islands and from Madeira.\n\nThe public television station RTP usually shows bullfights in prime-time. This has been notoriously criticized by left-wing parties who have tried to ban the programme and, in another instance, rating the show to an adults-only classification.\n"}
