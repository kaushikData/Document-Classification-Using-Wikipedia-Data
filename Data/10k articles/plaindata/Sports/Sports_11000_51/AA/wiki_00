The investigation was mostly concentrated on European football, but the investigation also took place in Africa, South America and in Asia. In 2012, over 50 countries were under investigation for match-fixing. That number being about one quarter of the entire 209 member in FIFA’s governing body.\n\nThe Lebanese match fixing scandal was a report that led to the suspension of 24 Lebanese players in domestic clubs in Lebanon, Asian clubs, and even the Lebanese national team. The suspicion of a scandal within Lebanese football began in late 2012, when a large number of Lebanese players were accused of purposely losing games in the Lebanese league and other leagues across Asia. The scandal was not limited to only matches being played in football leagues across Asia, but also took place on the international level. The players would be bribed by large betting companies in order to throw away the game or put the other team in favor of winning the match. Once the scandal came to life, Lebanon’s Football Association began to investigate the allegations that were being made against the Lebanese football players. The LFA (Lebanese Football Association) appointed the General Secretary of West Asian Football Federation Fadi Zreiqat in order to lead the investigation. During the 2 month long investigation that involved more than 60 witnesses, the General Secretary of West Asian Football Federation Fadi Zreiqat conclusion proved that match fixing was actually occurring.\n\nIn total, 24 players and 2 officials were involved in the match fixing scandal. Soon after Fadi Zreiqat’s conclusion, the Lebanese Football Association provided the players allocated in the scandal with fines and also suspensions from playing the sport. 20 Lebanese football players were suspended from playing the sport for 1 year and given a $3000 fine, while 2 players were suspended for 3 years and given each a $7000 fines. These 22 players that were fined and suspended either belonged to the domestic league in Lebanon or other leagues across Asia. The most severe punishments came to Ramez Dayoub and Mahmoud Al Ali. These 2 players were given each a $15 000 fine and banned from playing the sport for life. Ramez Dayoub and Mahmoud Al Ali both play for Lebanon’s national football team and also club teams in Asia. The reason why Ramy Dyoub and Mahmoud Al Ali punishments were more severe than the other players was because the match fixing took place on the international level while they were playing for the national team of Lebanon. Mahmoud Al Ali and Ramez Dyoub have been associated with attempting and succeeding to throw away and manipulate the match on different occasions. The matches that these two players are allocated in are believed to be a tournament that took place in Saudi Arabia and there are rumors that they also took place during a match against Qatar in the 2014 World Cup Qualifiers.\n\nLebanon advanced for the first time in its history to the 4th and final round of the World Cup Qualifiers, but because of the match fixing scandal which led to a crucial loss, their hopes of qualifying for the 2014 tournament decreased significantly. Theo Bucker, the German coach who took control of Lebanon’s national team in 2011 and took the team from being unsuccessful and having a negative performance, transformed the national team and made Lebanon qualify to the final round of the World Cup Qualification, he was extremely disappointed and frustrated. Theo Bucker made football the most watched sport in Lebanon and brought tremendous success by beating the Asian football giants Iran and South Korea. In 2012, Lebanon lost to Qatar in the World Cup Qualifiers 1-0. Ramez Dayoub had given an extremely terrible pass that was intercepted by the Qatar striker Sebastian Soria who gave Qatar their only goal to defeat Lebanon. After the investigation was complete, Bucker had the following to say : “We were showing some action and then suddenly a (Qatar) player has the ball in a one-on-one situation and you get the feeling that something is wrong. The guy looked paralysed or something.” His frustration toward Ramez Dayoub continued when he said “ I never came close to the idea that someone could not just sell the game, but sell their country”.\n\nSoon after the Lebanese Football Associations handed out these penalties to the players involved in the match fixing scandal, FIFA sent a letter to the Lebanese Football Association and praised them for the way they responded to the report.\n\nRamez Dayoub was pulled minutes before by his own teammates before the AFC Cup match against Kingfisher East Bengal. Selangor FA lost the match 1-0 as Lalrindika Ralte scored a goal. Besides being banned for life they were also fined $15,000. Ramez told Fox Sports \"I am not guilty. They have suspended me and accused me of matchfixing without any evidence or proof,\" Another two domestic players, Al-Negma's Mohamad Jaafar and Al Ahed's Hadi Sahmarani, were banned for three seasons and handed $7,000 fines for their involvement. Ten more of Sahmarani's teammates at the Lebanese Premier League club were banned for a year and each given $2,000 fines. Among the 22, one is Akram Moghrabi, who played for Churchill Brothers S.C. in 2012-13 I-League. The AFC has received the summary report from the LFA on their investigations and subsequent action against involvement of Lebanese players in match-fixing. AFC has also requested LFA to provide the full investigation report. The LFA has informed the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and the federations of Malaysia and Indonesia of sanctions on Lebanese players plying their trade in these countries.\n\nRamez Dayoub<br>\nMahmoud El Ali\n\nMohamad Jaafar<br>\nHadi Al Sahmrani\n\nAkram Moghrabi<br>\nAli Al Saadi<br>\nAhmad Zreik<br>\nAli Faour<br>\nAli Bazzi<br>\nAbbas Kanaan<br>\nAhmad Younnes<br>\nBashar El Mokdad<br>\nHassan Mezher<br>\nHassan Alawiye<br>\nHussein Charife<br>\nHussein Dakik<br>\nMohammad Younes<br>\nMohammad Hammoud<br>\nMohammad Abou Atik<br>\nNazih Assaad<br>\nOmar Owaida<br>\nSamer Zeineddine<br>\nTarek Ali\n"}

{"id": "1864145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864145", "title": "Beach soccer", "text": "Beach soccer\n\nBeach Soccer, also known as beach football or beasal, is a variant of association football played on a beach or some form of sand.\n\nThe game emphasises skill, agility and accuracy in shooting at the goal.\n\nWhilst football has been played informally on beaches for many years, the introduction of \"beach soccer\" was an attempt to codify rules for the game. This was done in 1992 by the founders of Beach Soccer Worldwide, a company set up to develop the sport and responsible for the majority of its tournaments to this day. This was a major foundation for what is now known as beach soccer and what has led to the sport rapidly growing in popularity.\n\nThe irregularity of the soft-sand playing surface leads to a totally different style of play than is used in football, with a greater degree of improvisation. The compact field, much smaller than a normal football field, allows players to score from anywhere on the sand, leading to an average of sixty attempts at goal in a single game. With an average scoring rate of one goal every three or four minutes, around eleven goals are scored in total during an average game.\n\nBeach football ( or \"futebol de areia\") started in Brazil, more precisely at Rio de Janeiro. In 1950 the first official tournament was created to unite neighborhood small tourneys that happened since 1940. After huge popularity it has grown to be an international game. The participation of internationally renowned players such as flamboyant Frenchman Eric Cantona, legendary Spanish strikers Michel and Julio Salinas and Brazilian stars such as Romário, Júnior and Zico has helped to expand television coverage to large audiences in over 170 countries worldwide.\n\nBeach soccer had been played recreationally all over the world for many years and in many different formats. In 1992 the laws of the game were envisioned and a pilot event was staged by the founding partners of BSWW in Los Angeles. By 1993, the first professional beach soccer competition was organized at Miami Beach, with teams from the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Italy taking part.\n\nIn April 1994 the first event to be covered by network television transmissions was held on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, and the city hosted the first Beach Soccer World Championship in 1995. The competition was won by the host nation, making Brazil the first-ever World Champions of Beach Soccer. The success of the tournament saw commercial interest begin to match developments on the field, and growing demand for the sport around the world gave rise to the Pro Beach Soccer Tour in 1996.\n\nThe first Pro Beach Soccer Tour included a total of 60 games in two years across South America, Europe, Asia and the United States, attracting major names both on and off the field. Interest generated by the tour in Europe led to the creation of the European Pro Beach Soccer League in 1998, providing a solid infrastructure that would increase the professionalism of the spectacle on all levels. The EPBSL, now known as the Euro BS League, brought promoters together from across the continent and satisfied the demands of the media, sponsors and fans. Only four years on from its creation, the successful first step in the building of a legitimate worldwide competition structure for the sport of pro beach soccer had been taken.\n\nBehind the scenes key developments were also taking place, with the Beach Soccer Company relocating its headquarters to Europe, firstly to Monaco and then Barcelona, before becoming Pro Beach Soccer, S.L. in April 2000. One year later they would join forces with Octagon Koch Tavares, who had continued to organise the World Championships and events in South America, to form a single entity known as Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW), with the aim of unifying all major Pro Beach Soccer tournaments in the world under the same structure and providing representation of the sport to major sponsors, the media and FIFA.\n\nThe EPBSL was also flourishing, a nail-biting 2000 season was decided in the closing match of the final tournament when Spain beat Portugal in an intense encounter. The Americas League also took shape, with teams entered from North and South America, whilst the Pro Beach Soccer Tour extended its horizons to the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Mexico, Greece, Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nFIFA became the global governing body of the sport in 2005, acknowledging BSWW's framework and organizing the first FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.\n\nThe next four years would see this growth consolidated by further progress both on and off the field, with the EPBSL emerging as the strongest pro beach soccer competition in the world. By 2004, some seventeen nations had entered teams, with this number expected to rise to over stage events.\n\nSuch interest has allowed BSWW to strike major sponsorship deals with international companies including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and MasterCard, who stepped up their involvement in 2004 and are now title sponsors of the Euro BS League. Recognition has also come from FIFA, who have cited BSWW as the major entity behind the creation and growth of Beach Soccer, forming a highly promising partnership that was in its full splendour seen in the 2005 world cup, held in Copacabana Beach, Brazil. France won the first world cup and the next year Brazil won it\nat the same venue. The World Cup has continued to flourish with the first held outside Brazil in 2008, and future World Cups spreading as far out as Tahiti in 2013 and Portugal in 2015\n\nAs of 2017, FIFA and the continental confederations do not host women's beach soccer tournaments. The Asian Beach Games, European Games and South American Beach Games also do not have women's beach soccer tournaments.\n\nThe rules of beach soccer are based on the Laws of the Game of association football, with several modifications. \n\nA beach soccer field is a level sandy area considerably smaller than a regular football field. The field is cleared of pebbles and seashells, along with any other objects which could injure a player.\n\nThe field is rectangular in shape, and the touch line is longer than the goal line.\nThe field dimensions are:\n\n\nThe penalty area is within 9 m (9.8 yards) of the goals, and is marked by a yellow flag situated in touch. Two red flags opposite each other are at the center of the field to represent the half-way line. The goals are slightly smaller than their standard association football counterparts, being from the ground to the bottom of the crossbar and in width between the inside of each upright.\n\nEach team consists of five players, including the goalkeeper and an unlimited number of substitutions, from a selection of three to five players. Throw-ins and kick-ins mean the pace and flow of the game are much faster than regular football. Shoes are not allowed; players must play in bare feet, although ankle guards are permitted. Goal clearances (the equivalent of a goal kick) are taken by the goalkeeper using their hands to throw the ball and a goal cannot be scored directly from these.\n\nA game lasts thirty-six minutes, and is split up into three twelve-minute periods. Unlike association football, in professional matches the referee is not the sole arbiter of the end of a period. A separate timekeeping official controls the official game clock, which is stopped for stoppages in play, and typically counts down to zero, as in North American sports such as basketball and ice hockey. Draws are not permitted, with the game going into three minutes of extra time, followed by a penalty shootout if the score is still on level terms after normal time. Unlike football, penalty kicks are decided by sudden death rules.\n\nBeach soccer has two on-field referees who co-operatively referee the game. They are assisted by a third referee, who acts in a manner similar to football's fourth official and a timekeeper.\n\nAs in football, yellow and red cards can be issued. Unlike in football, the team can then bring on a substitute to replace the dismissed player after two minutes. Similar to a power play in ice hockey, this period of numerical advantage ends early if the penalised team concedes a goal.\n\nFree kicks are awarded for various fouls. All free kicks are direct free kicks which has to be taken by the player who was fouled, unless awarded for deliberate handling. The laws specify that all players apart from the opposing goalkeeper must clear a zone between the kicker and the goal. Because of this and the small playing area, all free kicks represent a good opportunity to score. Penalties are awarded for fouls within the penalty area.\n\n\nThe following are main beach soccer competitions:\n\n\n\nAFC (Asian Football Confederation):\nCAF (Confederation of African Football):\nCONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football):\nCONMEBOL (South American Football Confederation):\nOFC (Oceania Football Confederation):\nUEFA (Union of European Football Associations):\n\n\n"}

The arena is the home of the California Vulcans men and women's basketball and volleyball teams, as well as the host of graduation commencement. The Convocation Center is able to host other sporting events, concerts, and trade shows, featuring a removable hardwood surface. The building, covering over 142,000 sq. feet, is the largest indoor venue between Morgantown, West Virginia, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Cal U Convocation Center is also home to the \"Rivers Bend Conference Center,\" which features executive-level conferencing facilities. Also included in the venue are \"smart\" classrooms, configurable for large or small-group presentations, high-tech audio and visual systems, wireless Internet access, webcams, videoconferencing equipment, and interactive response systems. The building replaces the Vulcans previous basketball and volleyball arena, Hamer Hall, which opened its doors in 1965.\n\nA ceremonial ground-breaking ceremony was held on August 5, 2009. The convocation center was constructed across from Hamer Hall in the area which previously served as the Hamer Parking Lot. While the University is looking for a sponsor for naming rights, the building has been officially deemed the \"California University Convocation Center.\" Dr. Angelo Armenti, President of Cal U, stated in the groundbreaking ceremony that the center \"will be a landmark building for our campus,”and “Besides meeting the University’s needs, it will serve as a cultural resource and contribute to the economic vitality of Southwestern Pennsylvania.”\n\nOn August 3, 2010, a topping-off ceremony was held at the construction site to mark the placement of the final of the forty-six steel trusses on the building's frame.\n\nConstruction of the building took approximately two years and three months to complete. Construction has forced the closure of multiple streets, lots, and intersections, including the Hamer Parking Lot, Hamer Way, the intersection of Hamer and Third Street, the Third Street entrance to the river parking lot, as well as a two-year-old recreational basketball court. The Convocation Center's location had created a parking quagmire on campus, as construction of a new parking garage located behind the Manderino Library did not open until Fall of 2010, leaving a full year of school without enough parking on campus.\n\nL. Robert Kimball & Associates served as the architects and engineers for the project, while General Contracting was under the direction of The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company of Hershey, PA. Wayne Crouse, Inc. served as the HVAC Contractor, while WG Tomko, Inc. also served as the Plumbing Contractor. In addition, California University contracted A-1 Electrical Service of Venetia, PA and Ryco, Inc., as Electrical and Fire Protection Contractors, respectively.\n\nThe tight space the Convocation Center lies in between Hamer Hall, Gallagher Hall, and the railroad track forced construction equipment and staging areas to be moved behind the Morgan Learning Resource Center in the current \"University Loop Road\" area.\n\nThe Convocation Center officially opened for basketball action on December 3, 2011, with both the men's and women's teams defeating Mansfield University. The women won the opening game 79-52, while the men defeated the Mounties 91-65 in the second game of the doubleheader.\n\nThe project's large size had been questioned before construction began, including by a university consultant who recommended building the arena with 3,500 seats. By April 2011 the university was reporting that construction costs on the center were $5.5 million over the original budget. A \"grand opening\" concert by Kenny Rogers in April 2012 attracted only a half-capacity audience, leading to renewed questions about the scale and cost of the project. In May 2012, university president Angelo Armenti was fired by the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education Board of Governors; among the issues cited in reports of this action were concerns about the financing and financial impact of the convocation center.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8338046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8338046", "title": "Candidate move", "text": "Candidate move\n\nIn abstract strategy board games, candidate moves are moves which, upon initial observation of the position, seem to warrant further analysis. Although in theory the idea of candidate moves can be applied to games such as checkers, go, and xiangqi, it is most often used in the context of chess.\n\nThe idea of candidate moves was first put forth by Grandmaster Alexander Kotov in his book \"Think Like a Grandmaster\". In it, Kotov recommended looking for several moves that seemed feasible – the so-called candidate moves – and then analyzing those moves one at a time. Although this idea had been practiced by expert chess players for some time, it had never been explicitly articulated, and was relatively unknown to players at the amateur level.\n\nThe idea quickly caught on, and is now considered standard practice among chess players at all levels. Many beginning players are taught about candidate moves as soon as they learn to play the game, and there are numerous references to the idea in other chess books.\n\nFinding the correct candidate moves is often one of the most difficult aspects of becoming a better chess player. Kotov, as well as other teachers, recommend using a system of pattern recognition, looking at the elements of the current position to determine what might be a feasible move. For example, if a player notices that his opponent's king is on the g8 square, and that his knight is on f3, then a candidate move might be Ng5, a fairly common beginning to a sacrifice.\n\nOnce a player has found a good number of candidate moves (every position is different, although four to six moves is usually the norm), a player may then begin to systematically analyze these moves. The idea behind candidate moves is to help structure one's analysis and prevent it from becoming jumbled; inexperienced players who do not carefully consider candidate moves will often find themselves jumping between lines of analysis haphazardly.\n\nThe ability of humans to find candidate moves remains one of the main differences between them and computers. Although early chess programmers made admirable efforts to make computers able to select candidate moves (see Type A versus Type B programs), they never played particularly well, and were soon supplanted by computers using brute-force algorithms (Shenk, 2006). The addition of Alphabeta algorithms made the latter type even more feasible. Many acknowledged that computers were simply not capable of performing the complex pattern recognition that was required to find appropriate candidate moves, and that it was easier to have computers perform simple exhaustive searches.\n\nToday, most chess programs still rely mainly on brute-force searches, but as search algorithms have improved, today's chess engines seem more and more to be using candidate moves in their analysis. Hydra, for example, is widely considered to be a \"Type B\" (candidate move finding) computer.\n"}

Her humiliation led to a change in the gender verification policies by the International Olympic Committee, which from then on kept test results secret.\n\nIAAF erased the three world records set by Kłobukowska, including the two team records in the 4×100 m relay.\n\n"}

{"id": "10687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10687", "title": "Frisbee", "text": "Frisbee\n\nA frisbee (also called a flying disc or simply a disc) is a gliding toy or sporting item that is generally plastic and roughly in diameter with a pronounced lip. It is used recreationally and competitively for throwing and catching, as in flying disc games. The shape of the disc, an airfoil in cross-section, allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air. Spinning it imparts a stabilizing gyroscopic force, allowing it to be both aimed and thrown for distance.\n\nA wide range of flying disc variants are available. Those for disc golf are usually smaller but denser and tailored for particular flight profiles to increase/decrease stability and distance. The longest recorded disc throw is by David Wiggins, Jr. with a distance of 338.0 meters. Disc dog sports use relatively slow flying discs made of more pliable material to better resist a dog's bite and prevent injury to the dog. Flying rings are also available; they typically travel significantly farther than any traditional flying disc. Illuminated discs for play after dark are made of phosphorescent plastic, contain chemiluminescent fluid, or battery-powered LEDs. Others whistle when they reach a certain velocity in flight.\n\nThe term \"frisbee\" is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company. While used generically in casual conversation to describe all flying discs, this protection results in organized sports such as Ultimate or disc golf having to forgo the word.\n\nIt is unknown when humans began tossing disc-shaped objects such as seashells or round stones, but throwing the discus was an event in the organized Olympic Games of Ancient Greece. The sport was resurrected and made part of modern track and field games, appearing at levels from high school to the modern Olympics. Modern discs were made of weighted wood, surrounded by a protective metal band, and weighed several pounds.\n\nFred Morrison discovered a market for a light duty flying disc that could be tossed recreationally in 1938 when he and future wife, Lucile, were offered 25 cents for a cake pan that they were tossing back and forth on a beach near Los Angeles, California. \"That got the wheels turning, because you could buy a cake pan for five cents, and if people on the beach were willing to pay a quarter for it, well—there was a business,\" Morrison told \"The Virginian-Pilot\" newspaper in 2007.\n\nThe Morrisons continued their business until World War ll, when Morrison served in the Army Air Force, flying P-47s, and then was a prisoner of war. Mustered out, Morrison sketched a design for an aerodynamically improved flying disc that he called the Whirlo-Way. By 1948, after design modifications and experimentation with several prototypes, Morrison and business partner Warren Franscioni began producing the first plastic discs, renaming them the Flyin-Saucer in the wake of reported unidentified flying object-sightings.\n\n\"We worked fairs, demonstrating it,\" Morrison told the \"Virginian-Pilot\". The two of them once overheard someone saying the pair were using wires to make the discs hover, so they developed a sales pitch: \"The Flyin-Saucer is free, but the invisible wire is $1.\" \"That's where we learned we could sell these things,\" he said, because people were enthusiastic about them.\n\nMorrison and Franscioni ended their partnership in early 1950, and in 1954 Morrison formed his own company, called American Trends, to buy and sell Flyin Saucers, which were by then being made of a flexible polypropylene plastic by Southern California Plastics, the original molder. After learning that he could produce his own disc more cheaply, in 1955 Morrison designed a new model, the Pluto Platter, the archetype of all modern flying discs. He sold the rights to Wham-O on January 23, 1957, and in 1958 Morrison was awarded U.S. Design Patent D183,626 for his product.\n\nIn June 1957, Wham-O co-founders Richard Knerr and Arthur \"Spud\" Melin gave the disc the brand name \"Frisbee\" (pronounced \"friz'-bee\") after learning that Northeastern college students were calling the Pluto Platter by that term, which derived from the name of the Connecticut-based pie manufacturer, Frisbie Pie Company, a supplier of pies to Yale University, where students had independently started a campus craze tossing empty pie tins stamped with the company's logo the way Morrison and his wife had in 1937.\n\nIn 1982, Morrison told \"Forbes\" magazine that he had received about US$2 million in royalty payments and said: \"I wouldn't change the name of it for the world.\" By 1994 100 million Frisbees had been sold, yet by 2007 he had changed his tune: \"I thought the name was a horror. Terrible,\" Morrison told \"The Press-Enterprise\" of Riverside in 2007. It is unknown how many more millions he had made since 1982.\nThe man behind the Frisbee's success, however, was native Southern Californian Edward \"Steady Ed\" Headrick , hired in 1964 as Wham-O's new general manager and vice president in charge of marketing. Headrick soon redesigned the Pluto Platter by reworking the mold, mainly to remove the names of the planets, but in the process, fortuitously increasing the rim thickness and mass, creating a more controllable disc that could be thrown more accurately.\n\nWith the change in marketing strategy to promote Frisbee use as a new sport sales of the toy skyrocketed. In 1964, the first professional model went on sale. Its new design, patented by Headrick, featured raised ridges (the \"Rings of Headrick\") that were claimed to stabilize flight.\nHeadrick, who became known as the father of Frisbee sports, later founded the International Frisbee Association and appointed Dan \"Stork\" Roddick as its head. Stork began establishing North American Series (NAS) tournament standards for various Frisbee sports, such as Freestyle, Guts, Double Disc Court and Over-all events. Headrick later helped to develop the sport of disc golf by inventing standardized targets called \"pole holes\", that was first played with Frisbees and later with more aerodynamic beveled rim discs. Upon his death, Headrick was cremated, and, as requested by him, his ashes were molded into memorial discs and given to family and close friends and sold to benefit The Ed Headrick Memorial Museum.\n\nEnthusiasts founded the International Frisbee Association in 1967, and the next year, the Frisbee Golf Tournament began in Kalamazoo. Also in 1967, some New Jersey teenagers invented Ultimate Frisbee, a game that remains enthusiastically played today. Still a popular toy as well as a sporting good, the Frisbee was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nThe IFT guts competitions in Northern Michigan, the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships (1972), Toronto, ON, the Vancouver Open Frisbee Championships (1974), Vancouver, BC, the Octad (1974), New Jersey, the American Flying Disc Open (1974), Rochester, NY and the World Frisbee Championships (1974), Pasadena, CA are the earliest Frisbee competitions that presented the Frisbee as a new disc sport. Before these tournaments, the Frisbee was considered a toy and used for recreation.\n\nDouble disc court was invented and introduced in the early 1970s by Jim Palmeri, a sport played with two flying discs and two teams of two players. Each team defends its court and tries to land a flying disc in the opposing court.\n\nDogs and their human flying disc throwers compete in events such as distance catching and somewhat choreographed freestyle catching.\n\nThis is a precision and accuracy sport in which individual players throw a flying disc at a target pole hole. In 1926, In Bladworth, Saskatchewan, Canada, Ronald Gibson and a group of his Bladworth Elementary school chums played a game using metal lids, they called \"Tin Lid Golf.\" In 1976, the game of disc golf was standardized with targets called \"pole holes\" invented and developed by Wham-O's Ed Headrick.\n\nIn 1974, freestyle competition was created and introduced by Ken Westerfield and Discrafts Jim Kenner. Teams of two or three players are judged as they perform a routine that consists of a series of creative throwing and catching techniques set to music.\n\nA half-court disc game derived from Ultimate, similar to hot box. The object is to advance the disc on the field of play by passing, and score points by throwing the flying disc to a teammate in a small scoring area.\nThe game of guts was invented by the Healy Brothers in the 1950s and developed at the International Frisbee Tournament (IFT) in Eagle Harbor, Michigan. Two teams of one to five team members stand in parallel lines facing each other across a court and throw flying discs at members of the opposing team.\nA patented game scoring points by throwing and deflecting the flying disc and hitting or entering the goal. The game ends when a team scores exactly 21 points or \"chogs\" the disc for an instant win.\n\nThe most widely played disc game began in the late 1960s with Joel Silver and Jared Kass. In the 1970s it developed as an organized sport with Johnny Appleseeds and the creation of the Ultimate Players Association by Dan Roddick, Tom Kennedy and Irv Kalb. The object of the game is to advance the disc and score points by eventually passing the disc to a team member in the opposing team’s end zone. Players may not run while holding the disc.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4895310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4895310", "title": "Grand Slam Single", "text": "Grand Slam Single\n\nThe Grand Slam Single is the hit that ended Game 5 of the 1999 National League Championship Series between the New York Mets and one of their rivals, Atlanta Braves. The game was played on October 17, 1999 at Shea Stadium.\n\nThe game was tied 2–2, going into the top of the 15th inning, until Mets pitcher Octavio Dotel gave up an RBI triple to Keith Lockhart, giving the Braves a 3–2 lead. In the bottom of the 15th inning, the Mets loaded the bases against Braves relief pitcher Kevin McGlinchy. Mets catcher Todd Pratt drew a bases loaded walk, tying the score 3–3.\n\nThe next batter was Mets third baseman Robin Ventura. Ventura crushed the 2–1 pitch over the wall in right-center for an ostensible grand slam, winning the game for the Mets and driving the Mets players and fans into a frenzied celebration. Ventura, however, never reached second base as Todd Pratt, the runner who was on first, picked up Ventura in celebration. Subsequently, Ventura was mobbed by his teammates, never finishing his trot around the bases. Because he failed to touch all four bases, the hit was officially scored a single. Roger Cedeño, the runner on third at the time, was ruled the only runner to have crossed home plate before the on-field celebration began and the Mets were awarded a 4–3 victory. Thus, Ventura was only credited with a single and one RBI.\n\nSports books in Las Vegas were put into an unusual situation with the \"single\". If Ventura had completed his trip around the bases, the final score would have been 7–3, in which case the game would have gone \"over\" the over/under line, which was 7. Instead, the final score of 4–3 actually put the game \"under\", meaning that many bettors who would have received payouts (if the hit was ruled a home run) did not.\n\nThe play remains as one of the most memorable moments in Mets postseason history. Orel Hershiser, who played on the 1999 Mets remarked, \"It will be right up there with Kirk Gibson's home run (Hershiser was a teammate of Gibson with the Los Angeles Dodgers during their championship season of ), Carlton Fisk, Bucky Dent. This one will be on that tape with them.\" The Mets went on to lose the series to the Braves.\n\nAccording to Baseball-Reference.com, there have been at least two other instances of \"grand slam singles.\" Both occurred when a batter hit a grand slam but subsequently passed the runner ahead of him on the base paths, which according to the rules of Major League Baseball causes the runner who passes his teammate to be called out. This happened on July 9, 1970, when Dalton Jones of the Detroit Tigers passed teammate Don Wert in a game against the Boston Red Sox, leaving him with a 3-RBI single.\n\nIt also occurred on July 4, 1976, when Tim McCarver of the Philadelphia Phillies passed teammate Garry Maddox during a 10–5 win in the first game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates, leaving him with a 3-RBI single. In both cases, the other three runs still counted because only the player who passes his teammate is called out. The three baserunners are able to score. Both of these hits took place with fewer than two outs.\n\nPrior to 1920, if a batter hit a walk off home run, he would receive credit for advancing only as many bases as necessary for the winning run to score. Therefore, a walk-off grand slam in a tie game would have officially been scored as a single, and only one run would count. A review in the 1960s found 37 walk-off hits that would have been considered home runs under today's rules, but were instead ruled singles, doubles, or triples under the rules of the time. In April 1968, a committee voted to retroactively change these to home runs, but reversed their ruling a week later following public outrage about the decision extending Babe Ruth's then-record to 715 home runs. It is unclear how many, if any, of these hits were singles that would have been grand slams under modern rules.\n\nHad Ventura completed his trip around the bases, it would have been the first walk-off grand slam in MLB postseason history. That honor eventually went to Nelson Cruz, whose 11th inning bases-loaded home run won game 2 of the 2011 ALCS for the Texas Rangers over the Detroit Tigers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2399936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2399936", "title": "History of cricket to 1725", "text": "History of cricket to 1725\n\nThe earliest definite reference to cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., an \"Old Style\" Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is a deposition in the records of a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, re the use of a parcel of land c.1550 and John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony makes clear that the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin is a mystery. All that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that its beginning was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.\n\nAlthough nothing is known of a \"cricket season\" \"per se\" in 1598, cricket was being played in the south-east of England at the time and so 1598 was the first season, as such, since the sport's earliest known reference. The sparse information available about the early years suggests that it may have been a children's game in the 16th century but, by 1611, it had become an adult pastime. The earliest known organised match was played circa 1611, a year in which other significant references to the sport are dated. From 1611 to 1725, fewer than thirty matches are known to have been organised between recognised teams. Similarly, only a limited number of players, teams and venues of the period have been recorded. The earliest matches played by English parish teams are examples of village cricket. Although village matches are now considered minor in status, the early matches are significant in cricket's history simply because they are known. There were no newspaper reports of matches until the end of the seventeenth century and so the primary sources are court records and private diaries, hence games were rarely recorded.\nDuring the reign of Charles I, the gentry took an increased interest as patrons and occasionally as players. A big attraction for them was the opportunity that the game offered for gambling and this escalated in the years following the Restoration when cricket in London and the south-eastern counties of England evolved into a popular social activity. The patrons staged lucrative eleven-a-side matches featuring the earliest professional players. Meanwhile, English colonists had introduced cricket to North America and the West Indies, and the sailors and traders of the East India Company had taken it to the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIn the first quarter of the 18th century, more information about cricket became available as the growing newspaper industry took an interest. The sport noticeably began to spread throughout England as the century went on. By 1725, significant patrons such as Edwin Stead, Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Sir William Gage were forming teams of county strength in Kent and Sussex. The earliest known great players, including William Bedle and Thomas Waymark, were active. Cricket was attracting large, vociferous crowds and the matches were social occasions at which gambling and alcoholic drinks were additional attractions.\n\nThe most widely accepted theory about the origin of cricket is that it first developed in early medieval times to the south and south-east of London in the geographical areas of the North Downs, the South Downs and the Weald. The counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey were therefore the earliest centres of excellence and it was from here that the game reached London, where its lasting popularity was ensured, and other southern counties like Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire and Middlesex. As early as c.1611, a cricket match was recorded at Chevening in Kent between teams representing the Downs and the Weald.\n\nA number of words in common use at the time are thought to be possible sources for the name \"cricket\". In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598, it is called \"creckett\". Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch \"krick\"(\"-e\"), meaning a stick; or the Old English \"cricc\" or \"cryce\" meaning a crutch or staff. In what may be an early reference to the sport, a 1533 poem attributed to John Skelton describes Flemish weavers as \"kings of crekettes\", a word of apparent Middle Dutch origin. In Samuel Johnson's \"Dictionary of the English Language\" (1755), he derived cricket from \"\"cryce\", Saxon, a stick\". In Old French, the word \"criquet\" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick, though this may have been the origin of croquet. Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word \"krickstoel\", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church, the shape of which resembled the two stump wicket used in early cricket. According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the University of Bonn, \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, \"met de (krik ket)sen\" (i.e., \"with the stick chase\"). Gillmeister believes the sport itself had a Flemish origin but \"the jury is still out\" on the matter.\n\nCricket was probably devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. Possibly it was derived from bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a wicket gate), a stool or a tree stump as the wicket. The invention of the game could have happened in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.\n\nAll acknowledged subject experts and authorities agree that there is no evidence of cricket having evolved from another bat-and-ball sport and, equally, no evidence that any other bat-and-ball sport evolved from cricket. The authorities include writers Harry Altham, John Arlott, Derek Birley, Arthur Haygarth, David Underdown, Roy Webber and Peter Wynne-Thomas. Their consensus view is that the only thing that can definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century. There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. For example, the writer Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in Dál Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of \"Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket\". It is true that cricket is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty. Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's brännboll, Italy's , India's gilli-danda, Finland's pesäpallo and Samoa's kilikiti. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as stoolball, rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these, or \"vice versa\", cannot be determined. There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick. 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.\n\nOn Thursday, 10 March 1300 (Julian calendar), wardrobe accounts of King Edward I of England included refunds to one John de Leek of monies that he had paid out to enable Prince Edward to play \"creag and other games\" at both Westminster and Newenden. Prince Edward, the future Prince of Wales, was then aged 15. It has been suggested that \"creag\" was an early form of cricket. However, creag could have been something quite different. Creag is possibly an early spelling of the word \"craic\" here taken as an Irish word meaning fun, entertainment, or enjoyable conversation. This sense of the word \"crack\" is found in Irish English, Scottish English, and Geordie in North East England. In Ireland the spelling \"craic\" is now more common than \"crack\".\n\nThe earliest definite reference to cricket being played anywhere in England (and hence anywhere in the world) is in evidence given at a 1597 legal case, concerning ownership of a parcel of land, which confirms that it was played on common land in Guildford, Surrey, around 1550. The court in Guildford heard on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date, equating to the year 1598 in the Gregorian calendar) from a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that when he was a scholar at the \"Free School at Guildford\", fifty years earlier, \"hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play [on the common land] at creckett and other plaies\", confirming that the sport was played there by schoolboys c.1550. It is perhaps significant that cricket is the only one of the \"plaies\" to be specifically named.\n\nIn 1598, there was a reference to cricket in an Italian-English dictionary by Giovanni Florio. His definition of the word was: \"to make a noise as a cricket, to play \"cricket-a-wicket\", and be merry\". Florio is the first writer known to have defined \"cricket\" in terms of both an insect and a game. In a later edition of his dictionary in 1611, Florio infers that \"to play cricket-a-wicket\" has sexual associations with references to ', defined \"as we say cricket a wicket, or '\", and ', defined \"to thrum a wench lustily till the bed cry '\".\n\nThe first definite mention of cricket in Kent is deduced from a 1640 court case which recorded a \"cricketing\" of \"the Weald and the Upland\" versus \"the Chalk Hill\" at Chevening \"about thirty years since\" (i.e., c.1611). This is the earliest known village cricket match; and the earliest known organised match in Kent, in England and in the world. Inter-parish contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century. As with the 1597 reference, the case concerned the land on which the game was played. The 1611 season as such was the fourteenth since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597.\n\nIn 1611, a French-English dictionary was published by Randle Cotgrave who defined the noun \"crosse\" as \"the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket\"; the verb form of the word is \"crosser\", defined as \"to play at cricket\". Although cricket was defined as a boys' game in Cotgrave's dictionary, as per the Guildford schoolboys above, it was at this time that adult participation is known to have begun.\n\nIn 1613, a court case recorded that someone was assaulted with a \"cricket staffe\" at Wanborough, near Guildford. In 1616, John Bullokar referred to cricket in his \"An English Expositor\" as \"a kind of game with a ball\". In 1617, the 18-year-old Oliver Cromwell is recorded as playing cricket and football in London. This is the earliest definite reference to cricket in London.\n\nIn 1624, a fatality occurred following a match on Saturday, 28 August, at Horsted Keynes, now in East Sussex. A fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck on the head by the batsman, Edward Tye, who was trying to hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught. Vinall, who died thirteen days later at home in West Hoathly, is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a coroner's court, which returned a verdict of death by misadventure. The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at Selsey, now in West Sussex, a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time. When the first \"Laws of Cricket\" were encoded in 1744, it was illegal to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out. The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket.\n\nThe first definite mention of cricket in Sussex was in 1611 and relates to ecclesiastical court records stating that two parishioners of Sidlesham, now in West Sussex, had failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12 pence each and made to do penance, which meant confessing their guilt to the whole church congregation the following Sunday. The case is the first of several 17th century cricket references, until the Restoration in 1660, arising from Puritan disapproval of recreational activity, especially on Sundays. These references indicate that inter-parish matches were being played but there is nothing to suggest that any teams representative of counties were formed before the Restoration. There is no evidence of large scale gambling or patronage prior to the English Civil War and it was those factors which drove the formation of \"representative\" teams in the 18th century. It must be concluded, therefore, that the cricket being played before the war was of \"minor\" standard only: i.e., village cricket.\n\nPuritan interference had become enough of a problem by 1617 for James I to issue the \"Declaration of Sports\" (also known as \"The Book of Sports\") which listed the sports and recreations that were permitted \"on Sundays and other holy days\". Initially, the declaration was effective in Lancashire only, partly as a reaction to Puritan suppression there of football (i.e., \"mob football\" in those days), blood sports and other activities which encouraged gambling. In 1618, the declaration was issued nationally and then reissued by Charles I in 1633. Cricket is not mentioned, although its near relation bowls is on the prohibited list. The omission of cricket provides evidence as such that it was still an obscure regional activity.\nThe \"Declaration of Sports\" was strongly opposed by the Puritans, who were becoming increasingly influential. The purpose of the declaration was to rebuke the Puritans and prevent them from interfering in the people's lawful recreations. It had limited success until the Civil War began in 1642. The Puritans were by then in control of Parliament which closed the theatres and issued sanctions against other recreational activities although, again, there was no mention of cricket except when individual players were accused of \"breaking the Sabbath\". The \"Declaration of Sports\" manuscript was publicly burned by order of the Puritan Parliament in 1643.\n\nIn 1622, several parishioners of Boxgrove, near Chichester in west Sussex, were prosecuted for playing cricket in a churchyard on Sunday, 5 May. There were three reasons for the prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another reflected concern about church windows which may or may not have been broken; the third was that \"a little childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt\"! The latter reason was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman to hit the ball twice and so fielding near the batsman was very hazardous, as the incidents involving Jasper Vinall and Henry Brand were to drastically confirm.\n\nIn 1628, an ecclesiastical case related to a game at East Lavant, near Chichester in West Sussex, being played on a Sunday. One of the defendants argued that he had not played during evening prayer time but only before and after. It did him no good as he was fined the statutory 12d and ordered to do penance.\n\nThere are three further references before the Civil War. In a 1636 court case concerning a tithe dispute, a witness called Henry Mabbinck testified that he played cricket \"in the Parke\" at West Horsley in Surrey. Another ecclesiastical case recorded parishioners of Midhurst, West Sussex, playing cricket during evening prayer on Sunday, 26 February 1637 (i.e., Julian date). In 1640, Puritan clerics at both Maidstone and Harbledown, near Canterbury, denounced cricket as \"profane\", especially if played on Sunday.\n\nWhen the English Civil War began in 1642, the Long Parliament banned theatres, as they had met with Puritan disapproval. Although similar action would be taken against certain sports, there is no evidence of cricket having been prohibited. Except that players must not \"break the Sabbath\", references to the game before and during the Commonwealth suggest that it was approved; and Cromwell himself (see above) had been a player as a young man.\n\nIn 1654, three men were prosecuted at Eltham in Kent for playing cricket on a Sunday. As the Puritans were now firmly in power, Cromwell's Protectorate having been established the previous year, the penalty was doubled to 24 pence (two shillings). The defendants were charged with \"breaking the Sabbath\", not with playing cricket. There is no evidence that cricket, unlike the theatres and other forms of entertainment, was banned by the Puritans. Similarly, when Cromwell's commissioners banned sport in Ireland two years later on the grounds of \"unlawful assembly\", there is no evidence that the ban included cricket, which had probably not reached Ireland by that time.\n\nPuritan prejudice did not survive the Restoration. In 1671, a man called Edward Bound was charged with playing cricket on the Sabbath and was exonerated: evidence that attitudes had changed. The case was reported in Shere, Surrey.\n\nThe beginnings of cricket's social division between amateurs and professionals, from which the annual Gentlemen v Players contest ultimately evolved, can be traced to the reign of Charles I. In 1629, Henry Cuffin, a curate at Ruckinge in Kent, was prosecuted by an archdeacon's court for playing cricket on Sunday evening after prayers. He claimed that several of his fellow players were \"persons of repute and fashion\". This statement is the first evidence of cricket achieving popularity among the gentry.\n\nIt was the gentry who introduced large-scale gambling into cricket and some of these gamblers subsequently became patrons by forming select teams that would improve their chances of winning. During the Commonwealth, gambling was, of political necessity, low key. The earliest reference to gambling on a cricket match is in the records of a 1646 court case concerning non-payment of a wager that was made on a game at Coxheath in Kent on Friday, 29 May that year. Curiously, considering the huge sums of money staked later in the century, this wager was for twelve candles, but the participants included members of the local gentry. The match at Coxheath is the earliest known example of an \"odds\" game as two Coxheath players were against four Maidstone players; the Coxheath II won. It was possibly a single wicket match and, if that could be proved, it would be the earliest on record.\n\nIn 1652, a case at Cranbrook against John Rabson, Esq. and others referred to \"a certain unlawful game called cricket\". Rabson was evidently a member of the gentry but the other defendants were all working class. Cricket has long been recognised as a sport that bridged the class divide but, in time, the cricketing gentlemen came to be called \"amateurs\" to emphasise the distinction between themselves and the professionals who belonged to the lower social classes, mostly to the working class. The amateur became not merely someone who played cricket in his spare time but a particular type of top-class cricketer who existed officially until 1962, when the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished and all the then first-class players became nominally professional. In terms of remuneration, amateurs claimed expenses for playing while professionals were paid a salary or fee. Amateur cricket was an extension of the game played in schools, universities and other centres of education, both as a curricular and extracurricular activity. The schools and universities formed the \"production line\" that created nearly all the top-class amateur players.\nThere are few 17th century references to cricket being played at or in the vicinity of schools but, in 1647, a Latin poem contains a probable reference to cricket being played at Winchester College; if so, it is the earliest known mention of cricket in Hampshire. There is a reference to the game at St Paul's School, London c.1665 concerning John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who studied there. In his \"Social History of English Cricket\", Derek Birley comments that school cricket was \"alive and well during the interregnum\" (1649–1660). He speculates that the game \"must have been known to every schoolboy in the south-east\" of England. He doubts, however, that the sport at this time was part of any school's curriculum. Apart from Eton College and Westminster School, all schools in the 17th century had local intakes and no class segregation. Therefore, the sons of rich and poor families played together. As evidenced by the legal cases of 1646 and 1652, described above, cricket was played jointly by gentry and workers.\n\nThe earliest reference to cricket at Oxford University is dated 1673. In John Phillips' \"Duellum Musicum\", a 1673 pamphlet concerning music tuition, there is a criticism of his rival Thomas Salmon, who had boasted of being a graduate of Trinity College, Oxford:\n\"He shews but a slender sign of his University-Education: Where he seems to have spent his time rather in the more laudable Exercises of Trap and Cricket, than in any sound Reading\".\nDepending on when Salmon graduated, it would seem that cricket was a normal activity at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet. It was certainly well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19-year-old Samuel Johnson entered Pembroke College. He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his \"Life of Samuel Johnson\". A comment by Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton during the first quarter of the 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University is dated 1710 and both of those establishments were attended by William Goldwin who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called \"In Certamen Pilae\" (On a Ball Game) and it was published in his \"Musae Juveniles\".\n\nIt was during the second half of the 17th century that, as Roy Webber put it, \"the game took a real grip\" especially in the south-eastern counties. The nobility withdrew to their country estates during the Commonwealth and were involved in village cricket as a pastime which, after the Commonwealth expired in 1660, they took with them when they returned to London.\n\nThe Restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660 was immediately followed by the reopening of the theatres and sanctions imposed by the Puritans on sports were also lifted. Cricket was a leading entertainment and \"it was ideal for a wager\". According to Rowland Bowen, \"it is likely that the Restoration was the crucial factor in leading to the social acceptance of the game\". Although there are only scattered references to the game in the time of Charles II, it is clear that its popularity was increasing and that it was expanding.\n\nThe Restoration was effectively completed during the spring of 1660 and, in the general euphoria which both accompanied and followed these historic events, gambling on cricket and other sports was freely pursued. The large amounts at stake led some investors to try to improve their chances of winning by forming teams that were stronger than the typical parish XI. By now, the nobility had adopted cricket as one of their main sports along with horse racing and prizefighting. This was the beginning of the patronage that sustained and controlled cricket through the 18th century. The first teams representing several parishes and even whole counties were formed in the 1660s and the period saw the first \"great matches\" as cricket evolved into a major sport.\n\nA significant aspect of this evolution was the introduction of professionalism. Members of the nobility who returned to London after the Restoration were keen to develop cricket and brought with them some of the \"local experts\" from village cricket whom they now employed as professional players. Within a year or two of the Restoration, \"it became the thing in London society to make matches and form clubs\". A kind of \"feudal patronage\" was established as the nobility took control of the sport, their interest fuelled by the opportunities for gambling that it provided, and this set the pattern for cricket's development through the next century. Consequently, there was a significant rise in standards of play to the level that is now termed important.\n\nThe Gaming Act 1664 was passed by the \"Cavalier\" Parliament to try and curb some of the post-Restoration excesses. It limited stakes to £100 which was in any case a fortune at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. It is known that cricket could attract stakes of 50 guineas by 1697 and it was funded by gambling throughout the next century.\nThe shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. In May 1666, Sir Robert Paston of Richmond wrote a letter to his wife mentioning \"a game of criquett (\"sic\") on Richmond Green\" which is the first reference to cricket at Richmond Green, a popular venue for important matches during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThere was a significant development at Maidstone on Saturday, 28 March 1668 when the quarter sessions made a ruling that customs and excise could not claim excise duty on alcoholic drinks sold at a \"kricketing\"; it was further ruled that a match promoter had the right to sell ale to spectators, presumably after obtaining the necessary licence. As John Major suggested, this dealt a massive blow to \"Puritan morality\", and it could have been the beginning of the long-term relationship between sport and alcohol. Derek Birley's comment on the excise ruling was that cricket's \"connection with public houses is historic in every sense of the word\". In his view, the sport had \"arrived\" because the brewery trade was the earliest and strongest sponsor of popular sport.\n\nIn 1677, accounts of Thomas Lennard, 1st Earl of Sussex, include an item which refers to £3 being paid to him when he went to a cricket match being played at \"ye Dicker\", which was a common near Herstmonceux in East Sussex. In 1678, there was mention of cricket as \"a play\" (presumably in the sense of a sport that is played) in a Latin dictionary published by Dr Adam Littleton. In 1694, accounts of Sir John Pelham record 2s 6d paid for a wager concerning a cricket match at Lewes.\n\nMitcham Cricket Club was formed in 1685, the club playing on what is today known as Mitcham Cricket Green. The site has hosted cricket matches ever since. Mitcham is believed to be the world's oldest cricket club as there is no evidence of any club being founded before 1685. Croydon, Dartford and London had all been founded by the 1720s but their dates of origin have been lost, although there was an actual reference to a London Club in 1722.\nLondon Cricket Club was to become chiefly associated with the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. This venue was first mentioned re cricket on Friday, 7 May 1725, when the minutes of the Honourable Artillery Company referred to its being used for cricket: there is a note which concerns \"the abuse done to the herbage of the ground by the cricket players\". The Artillery Ground became the feature venue for cricket in the mid-18th century.\n\nIn 1695, Parliament decided against a renewal of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a free press on the Act's expiry in 1696. Censorship had already been relaxed following the Bill of Rights 1689. It was from this time that cricket matters could be reported in the newspapers, but it would be a very long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, reports. The earliest known newspaper report of a \"great match\" was in the \"Foreign Post\" dated Wednesday, 7 July 1697:\n\n\"The middle of last week (i.e., probably on Wednesday, 30 June 1697) a great match at cricket was played in Sussex; there were eleven of a side, and they played for fifty guineas apiece\".\n\nA historically significant event which is recorded by numerous sources, starting with G. B. Buckley in his \"Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket\", it is the world's earliest known important cricket match (possibly Sussex v Kent or Surrey) and, as Buckley said, \"the earliest record of an eleven a side match\". The stakes on offer confirm the importance of the fixture and the fact that it was eleven-a-side suggests that two strong and well-balanced teams were assembled. No other details were given but the report provides real evidence to support the view that \"great matches\" played for high stakes were in vogue in the years following the Restoration. Given the Sussex venue, Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond may have been one of the patrons involved. Following the decision of the English government in 1695 to allow freedom of the press (i.e., they decided not to renew the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which had inhibited the scope of publications), it was possible for sporting events to be reported; however, it was a long time before editors gave sport any priority so coverage remained low key and infrequent for several decades. The 1697 match occurred in the 100th season since cricket's earliest definite reference in 1597.\n\nPeriodicals called \"The Post Boy\" and \"The Post Man\" were in circulation during the early 18th century. In 1700, a series of ten-a-side matches to be held on Clapham Common, near Vauxhall, was pre-announced on Saturday, 30 March, by \"The Post Boy\". The first was to take place on Easter Monday, 1 April, and prizes of £10 and £20 were at stake. No match reports could be found so the results and scores remain unknown. The advert says the teams would consist of ten \"Gentlemen\" per side but the invitation to attend was to \"Gentlemen and others\". This clearly implies that cricket had achieved both the patronage that underwrote it through the 18th century and the spectators who demonstrated its lasting popular appeal. As the event involved \"gentlemen only\", it was probably minor in quality but is nevertheless the earliest known organised match in the county of Surrey.\n\nEarly cricketers played in their everyday clothes and had no protective equipment such as gloves or pads. A 1743 painting of a game in progress at the Artillery Ground depicts two batsmen and a bowler dressed alike in white shirt, breeches, white knee-length stockings and shoes with buckles. The wicket-keeper wears the same clothes with the addition of a waistcoat. An umpire and scorer wear three-quarter length coats and tricorn hats. Apart from the shirts and stockings, none of the clothes are white and no one wears pads or gloves. The ball is bowled underarm along the ground, as in bowls, at varying speed towards a wicket consisting of two stumps mounted by a single crosspiece. The batsman addresses the delivery with a bat that resembles a modern hockey stick, this shape being ideal for dealing with a ball on the ground. The modern straight bat evolved in the 1760s after bowlers began to \"give the ball air\" by pitching it. As a result, \"the game changed completely and evolved from its pioneering phase into what may be termed its pre-modern phase\".\nThe record of the 1622 case at Boxgrove contains the earliest reference to the cricket bat. The term \"batt\" in cricket was peculiar to Kent and Sussex, where coastal smugglers were known as \"batmen\" because of the cudgels they carried. The earliest reference to a \"flat-faced\" bat (i.e., with a flat surface at the bottom of the stick in ice hockey style) also occurs in 1622. The term \"bat\" remained comparatively rare until about 1720. The terms in more general use were \"staff\", \"stave\" or \"stick\". These tended to have regional usage: for example, \"stave\" was used in the Gloucester area and \"batt\" in the south-east; while \"staff\" and especially \"stick\" were more widely used. \"Bat\" is derived from the French \"battledore\", shaped like a table tennis bat, which was used by washerwomen to beat their washing with.\n\nThe earliest reference to the cricket ball is found in 1658 in \"Mysteries of Love and Eloquence\" by Edward Phillips. The pitch has been 22 yards long (i.e., a chain) since the first known code of Laws in 1744 and it is believed this length had been in use since the introduction of Gunter's chain in 1620. The over consisted of four deliveries until the 19th century.\n\nThe earliest known reference to the wicket is contained in lines written in an old bible in 1680 which invited \"All you that do delight in Cricket, come to Marden, pitch your wickets\". Marden is in West Sussex, north of Chichester, and close to Hambledon, which is just across the county boundary in Hampshire. The wicket until the 1770s comprised two stumps and a single bail. By that time, the shape of the wicket was high and narrow after the 1744 Laws defined the dimensions as 22 inches high and six inches wide. But earlier 18th century pictures show a wicket that was low and broad, perhaps two feet wide by one foot high. The ends of the stumps were forked to support the light bail and there were criteria for the firmness of pitching the stumps into the ground and for the delicate placing of the bail so that it would easily topple when a stump was hit.\n\nThere has been a lot of conjecture about the origin of the wicket, but suffice to say that the 17th century outline shape is more akin to the profile of a church stool, which is low and broad. Furthermore, the legs of the stool were called stumps, which adds further credence to the idea that stools were used as early wickets. According to the \"Churchwarden's Accounts for Great St. Mary's Church of Cambridge\" (1504–1635), a church stool was sometimes known in the south-east by the Dutch name of \"kreckett\", this being the same word used for the game by John Derrick in 1597.\n\nThe earliest known mention of the umpire dates from 1680 and is the first entry in Buckley's \"Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket\". Buckley does not quote the reference \"that is quite unfit for publication nowadays\" but he confirms a clear reference to \"the two umpires\" and that the double wicket form of the game was already well known in London. It is also the first mention of cricket in the county of Middlesex.\n\nThere were two main forms of cricket in the 17th and 18th centuries. One was single wicket in which, as the name implies, there is only one batsman, although teams of threes or fives often took part. The converse is the \"double wicket\" form, with two batsmen, and this has long been associated with eleven-a-side teams playing two innings each and it is these games which, depending on the teams involved, have important match status. Although single wicket was in vogue through the period of this history, the earliest \"definite\" record of a single wicket match is in 1726, so it is out of scope in this article.\n\nIn early cricket, there were two umpires as now, but the modern square-leg umpire stood close to the striker's wicket. Both umpires carried a bat which the running batsman was required to touch in order to complete his run. There were two scorers who sat on the field and recorded the scores by making notches on tallysticks; runs were then known as notches for this reason.\n\nOn an unknown date in 1702, the 1st Duke of Richmond's XI defeated an Arundel XI at an unspecified venue in Sussex. The source for this game is a receipt sent by one Saul Bradley to the Duke on Monday, 14 December 1702. The receipt was for one shilling and six pence paid by the Duke \"for brandy when your Grace plaid at Cricket with Arundel men\". It is thought the brandy was bought to celebrate a victory. The venue was probably either Goodwood, where Richmond had his estate, or Arundel, possibly on Bury Hill which was used for cricket in later years. Arundel was a prominent centre of cricket in the 18th century.\n\nAfter the 1st Duke of Richmond died in 1723, his son Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, quickly succeeded him as cricket's main benefactor and became a famous patron of Sussex cricket for the next thirty years. The 2nd Duke enjoyed a friendly rivalry with his friend Sir William Gage, another Sussex patron. Their teams played each other many times and their earliest known contest was on Tuesday, 20 July 1725, five days after Sir William's team was beaten by unknown opponents. Richmond wrote to Gage in early July 1725 and issued a challenge for a match to be played at Goodwood. Gage replied to him by letter on 16 July and confirmed that his team would play the Duke's on Tuesday, 20 July. Gage then stated that he is \"in great affliction from being shamefully beaten yesterday (Thursday, 15 July 1725) the first match I played ys (\"sic\") year\". He went on to wish the Duke success in everything except his cricket match. The game on 20 July was actually played at Bury Hill, Arundel and Richmond's team won by \"above forty (runs)\". The report in the \"Daily Journal\" newspaper on Wednesday, 21 July, confirms Bury Hill (then called Berry Hill), near Arundel, as the venue. The match, played before \"a vast Concourse of People\", was hosted by Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk who gave a ball at Arundel Castle in the evening. 1725 was English cricket's 128th season since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597.\n\nThe main rival to Richmond and Gage was Edwin Stead of Maidstone, who was the first of the noted Kent patrons. The Sussex teams of Richmond and Gage enjoyed an inter-county rivalry with Stead's Kent that could have originated the concept of the County Championship.\n\nThe patrons ensured that cricket was financed in the 18th century but their interest, equally applicable to horse racing and prizefighting, was based on the opportunities that cricket provided for gambling. Every important match in the 18th century, whether eleven-a-side or single wicket, was played for stakes. The early newspapers recognised this and were more interested in publishing the odds than the match scores. Reports would say who won the wager rather than who won the match.\n\nSometimes, gambling would lead to dispute and two matches ended up in court when rival interests sought legal rulings on the terms of their wagers. On Monday, 1 September 1718, a game on White Conduit Fields in Islington between London and the Rochester Punch Club was unfinished because three Rochester players \"made an elopement\" in an attempt to have the game declared incomplete so that they would retain their stake money. London was clearly winning at the time. The London players sued for their winnings and the game while incomplete was the subject of a noted lawsuit in which the terms of the wager were at issue. The court ordered that the match must be \"played out\" and this happened in early July 1719 (the exact date is uncertain but it was before the 4th). Rochester with four wickets standing needed thirty more runs to win but were all out for 9. It is not certain if 30 was their overall target or if they needed thirty more in addition to runs scored in the original encounter; equally, it is not known if 9 was the innings total they achieved or if they added nine more to their \"overnight\" score. London's 21-run victory is the earliest known definite result of any cricket match. The match is the earliest known mention of White Conduit Fields as a venue.\n\nIn 1724 (exact date unknown), Edwin Stead's XI v Chingford ended early because the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Stead's team had the advantage. Another court case followed. It is known that Lord Chief Justice Pratt presided over the case and ordered them, as in the London v Rochester match in 1718, to play it out so that all wagers could be fulfilled. Pratt \"referr'd the said Cause back to Dartford Heath, to be played on where they left off, and a Rule of Court was made accordingly\". The game was completed in 1726. The final result is not on record, and there is no confirmation that Stead's team held their advantage and won. This match is the earliest reference to cricket being played in Essex, if Chingford was the original venue, though it is assumed to have been Dartford Brent. It is certainly the first match known to have involved an Essex team.\n\nThe introduction of articles of agreement, agreed before matches by the stakeholders, largely resolved any problems between patrons and match organisers. The concept was more important in terms of defining the rules of play and eventually these were codified as the \"Laws of Cricket\".\n\nOn Tuesday, 24 July 1705, \"The Post Man\" announced West of Kent v Chatham, an 11-a-side game to be played in Kent on Tuesday, 7 August. The primary source gives the venue as \"Maulden\" which must have been a typeset error as there is no such place. It was possibly Maidstone or Malling. The title \"West of Kent\" suggests a team representative of several parishes, so this is arguably the earliest known important match in Kent. There were several matches throughout the 18th century involving teams called \"West Kent\" and \"East Kent\". Chatham was a prominent centre of cricket in the 18th century.\n\nOn Thursday, 26 June 1707, there was a London v Mitcham match at Lamb's Conduit Field, Holborn. The result is unknown. This is the earliest known important match in Middlesex and possibly the earliest known to involve the original London Cricket Club, though the date of the club's formation is uncertain and the team here might have been an \"ad hoc\" London XI. In contrast to the \"all England\" term used later in the century, the source calls the team \"all London\". Mitcham Cricket Club, which is extant, was founded in 1685.\n\nOn Tuesday, 1 and Tuesday, 8 July 1707, Croydon played London twice, the first game played in Croydon, probably at Duppas Hill, and the second at Lamb's Conduit Field in Holborn. Both matches were advertised by \"The Post Man\" as \"two great matches at cricket (to be) plaid, between London and Croydon; the first at Croydon on Tuesday, 1 July, and the other to be plaid in Lamb's-Conduit-Fields, near Holborn, on the Tuesday following, being the 3rd (\"sic\") of July\". No post-match reports could be found so the results and scores are unknown. The match in Croydon is the earliest known important match in Surrey. As with the previous match, it is not known if the teams at this time represented formally constituted clubs and it is possible that both were \"ad hoc\" teams drawn from local residents. Croydon and London both had important teams in the first half of the 18th century. The match in Holborn was a return to the one on 1 July. There has been some confusion about the date of the second match following a misreading of the original source by H. T. Waghorn, who was the first modern researcher, but Tuesday, 8 July is believed to be correct.\n\nOn Wednesday, 23 June 1708, a local match took place somewhere in the Canterbury area and was recorded in the diary of one Thomas Minter, a Canterbury resident, who wrote: \"We beat Ash Street at Crickets (\"sic\")\". Although this was probably a minor match only, it illustrates the popularity of cricket in Kent.\n\nThe earliest known match that definitely involved county teams, or teams using the names of counties, was Kent v Surrey at Dartford Brent on Wednesday, 29 June 1709. This was advertised in the \"Post Man\" the previous Saturday and played for a stake of £50. From this time, in the 112th season since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597, there are references to counties in use as team names although it is generally believed that the earliest \"inter-county matches\" were really inter-parish matches involving two villages on either side of a county boundary. Dartford was an important club in the first half of the 18th century and its team at this time featured William Bedle. The match is the earliest known mention of Dartford Brent as a venue.\n\nOne player who could have taken part in the 1709 match was William Bedle (1680–1768), of Dartford, who is the earliest great player whose name has been recorded. He was \"reckoned to be the most expert player in England\" and must have been in his prime c.1700 to c.1725. Other good players known to have been active in the 1720s were Edwin Stead of Kent; Edmund Chapman and Stephen Dingate of Surrey; Tim Coleman of London; and Thomas Waymark of Sussex.\n\nVillage cricket continued to thrive in the 18th century. On Friday, 31 May 1717, Thomas Marchant, a farmer from Hurstpierpoint in Sussex, first mentioned cricket in his diary. He made numerous references to the game, particularly concerning his local club, until 1727. His son Will played for \"our parish\", as he often called the Hurstpierpoint team. In total, his diaries mention 21 village matches and the entries provide evidence of the widespread popularity of cricket in Sussex. It is from the 1717 season that a continuous history of English cricket by season is possible. Records of cricket have survived from every season after 1716, although the details in most seasons through the 18th century remain sparse.\n\nThe first great rivalry in cricket history was between the Dartford and London clubs who are first known to have played each other in 1722. London played some matches against Kent but the county side is believed to have largely consisted of Dartford players. On Wednesday, 19 August 1719, London v Kent was played at White Conduit Fields and Kent won. The report said the teams played for \"a considerable sum of money\". There is an insight into the priorities of early 18th century cricketers as the contemporary report concludes with: \"The Kentish men won the wager\" (i.e., the wager was more important than the match).\n\nOn Saturday, 9 July 1720, London v Kent at White Conduit Fields was won by London. In this match, two London fielders were badly injured by a clash of heads. H. T. Waghorn noted a lull in the advertising and reporting of cricket after this game and he wondered if that was due to a perception that the sport was dangerous. If there was a lapse in cricket at this time, the more likely causes would be either: (a) the South Sea Bubble which ruined many investors and so could have reduced cricket patronage; or (b), as Waghorn himself mentions, \"the (news)papers were small, and space limited, the advertising and reporting (of) matches ceased\". The South Sea Bubble may have had an economic impact on investment and gambling as, when the South Sea Company was found to be insolvent, its crash in 1720 caused massive repercussions throughout the economy and many formerly prosperous investors were ruined. This could have included cricket patrons, while a potential impact on reporting was the application of stamp duty to newspapers as this increased their publication costs and probably caused publishers to reduce paper size with less room for sports coverage.\n\nOn Wednesday, 18 July 1722, London v Dartford was the subject of a letter in \"The Weekly Journal\" dated Saturday, 21 July 1722. It is believed the match took place somewhere in the Islington area, so the exact venue may have been White Conduit Fields. The match was abandoned following a dispute. The letter said: \"A Match at Cricket was made between the little Parish of Dartford in Kent, and the Gentlemen known by the name of the London Club\". Teams styled \"London\" were already in existence, as above, but this is the first actual reference to a \"London Club\".\n\nDartford and London met at Dartford Brent on Thursday, 11 June 1724 and, one week later, a return game was the earliest known match at Kennington Common, near where The Oval is now sited. The results of both matches are unknown.\n\nOn Wednesday, 6 July 1720, Kingston v Richmond was played at an unknown venue and Kingston won. The secondary source is uncertain about the date due to a slight ambiguity in the primary source, a contemporary newspaper published Saturday, 16 July, which refers to \"Wednesday last\". The date of the match must therefore be either 6 or 13 July. The source says 5 or 12 July but this is an error as those dates were Tuesdays. Kingston and Richmond both had important teams in the first half of the 18th century.\n\nThere was a Surrey v London match at Moulsey Hurst on an unknown date in 1723. The result is unknown. The source states that \"XI Gentlemen of Surrey played XI of London at Moulsey Hurst during the summer\". It is the earliest known mention of Moulsey Hurst as a venue for cricket.\n\nIn 1723, the prominent Tory politician Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford recorded in his journal: \"At Dartford upon the Heath as we came out of the town, the men of Tonbridge and the Dartford men were warmly engaged at the sport of cricket, which of all the people of England the Kentish folk are the most renowned for, and of all the Kentish men, the men of Dartford lay claim to the greatest excellence\". It is more than likely to have been Dartford Brent where this game was taking place.\n\nOn Monday, 10 August 1724, there was a match at Penshurst Park (result unknown) which featured the combined parishes of Penshurst, Tonbridge & Wadhurst versus Dartford. This was recorded in a diary entry by one John Dawson, who may have watched it. No details are known but Mr Dawson says it was \"a great cricket match\". Note that some sources have mistakenly given the venue as \"Islington\" but contemporary newspapers confirm that it took place at Penshurst Park.\n\nThe earliest known mention of cricket being played outside England is dated Saturday, 6 May 1676. A diarist called Henry Tonge, who was part of a British mission at Aleppo in the Ottoman Empire (now in Syria), recorded that \"at least forty of the English\" left the city for recreational purposes and, having found a nice place to pitch a tent for dinner, they \"had several pastimes and sports\" including \"krickett\". At six they \"returned home in good order\".\n\nBy this time, cricket had been introduced to India, North America and the West Indies but the first definite references occur in the 18th century. In 1709, cricket was played by William Byrd of Westover on his James River estates in Virginia, then a British colony. This is the earliest reference to cricket being played in the New World. There had not been any English colonisation of Australasia or southern Africa, where Test cricket is played now, by 1725. Australia and New Zealand had been partly explored by Abel Tasman in the 1640s but still had only their Aboriginal and Maori inhabitants respectively. The first European settlement in South Africa was founded on Tuesday, 6 April 1652 when the Dutch East India Company established Cape Colony on Table Bay, near present-day Cape Town.\n\nIn 1721, British sailors of the East India Company were reported to be playing cricket at Cambay, near Baroda, and this is the earliest reference to cricket being played in the Indian sub-continent. One of the players wrote: \"When my boat was lying for a fortnight in one of the channels, though the country was inhabited by the Culeys (\"sic\"), we every day diverted ourselves with playing Cricket and to other Exercises, which they would come and be spectators of\".\n\nIt is possible that cricket was introduced to the Americas and India before it had spread throughout the British Isles. For example, there is no record of cricket in Yorkshire, home of the English game's most successful club, until 1751. The earliest mentions of cricket in Ireland, Scotland and Wales occur even later in the 18th century.\n\nWhile Britain's seafaring and trading concerns ensured the spread of cricket overseas, at home it relied heavily on ease of transport and communications, most of these being waterborne as long journeys tended to be undertaken using coastal or river vessels. Road transport was slowly improving and, in 1706, Parliament established the first turnpike trusts that placed a length of road under the control of trustees drawn from local landowners and traders. The turnpike trusts borrowed capital for road maintenance against the security of tolls. This arrangement became the common method of road maintenance for the next 150 years and came in time to assist the spread of cricket throughout Britain.\n\nThe table below is fully chronological. It summarises all of the 27 known organised matches from 1611 to 1725 and does not separate matches by form or status. It therefore includes examples of both \"important\" and \"minor\" matches, bearing in mind that some minor matches are historically significant. Unless specified as such, \"impromptu\" games amongst friends, practice matches, etc. are excluded. Although single wicket was in vogue at the time, the earliest definite record of a single wicket match is in 1726.\n\nAs illustrated by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 because of the lack of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.\n\nThe four bulleted lists below summarise the known participants to 1725 under each heading. The earliest important match that is designated inter-county was in 1709 and the traditional county soon became the key unit of organisation. Until 1725, only nine counties (plus London which has on occasion been equated in status with the counties of Middlesex and Surrey for cricketing purposes) had been mentioned in surviving records in connection with cricket and the earliest mention of each is summarised below. Note that all are in the south-eastern quarter of the country. In a similar vein, although not always in association with one of the above matches, those players, venues, clubs and teams known to have been active or in use by 1725 are also listed.\n\nThe first definite mentions of cricket in the following traditional counties occurred between 1597 and 1724:\n\nWith the exception of Mitcham, club and team foundation dates cannot be determined, but it is known that the following clubs or teams were active during the period:\n\nThe contemporary sources rarely mentioned players by name but it is known that the following were active during the period:\n\nThe following venues are known to have been used during the period:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15308657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15308657", "title": "Manila Grand Opera House", "text": "Manila Grand Opera House\n\nThe Manila Grand Opera House (Filipino: \"Marangal na Bahay-Opera ng Maynila\", abbreviated MGOH) was a theater and opera house located in the Santa Cruz district of Manila on the intersection of Rizal Avenue and Doroteo Jose Street. First built in the mid-19th century as a circular wooden structure with a nipa roof known as the H.T. Hashim’s National Cycle Track, the complex served as the center of Philippine culture and the primary theater for the viewing of plays, movies and zarzuelas in Manila prior to the construction of the Cultural Center of the Philippines in the 1960s. The complex had undergone several incarnations and name changes before being demolished. A hotel has since been constructed on the site on where the theater once stood.\n\nThe Manila Grand Opera House was built in the mid-19th century as the H.T. Hashim’s National Cycle Track, a circular wooden structure with a nipa roof. In 1890, the name was changed to the \"Teatro Nacional\" (National Theater), where the Russian Circus and some American theater companies performed. The name was subsequently changed to the Manila Grand Opera House after an extensive expansion of the original theater and its conversion to an opera house in time for the visit of an Italian opera company in 1902, after the American takeover of the Philippines, and was used as the location of the inauguration of the members of the First Philippine Assembly on October 16, 1907.\n\nIt was in Manila Grand Opera House where the Philippines' pioneer symphonic group, the Manila Symphony Society, performed its first concert on January 22, 1926. The purpose of the concert was to raise funds for the building of the Philippine Constabulary Orchestra's music library.\n\nTwo important performances in Manila Grand Opera are Claro M. Recto's award-winning dramas \"La ruta de Damasco \" and \" Solo entre las sombras \" \n\nAnother key event is the convention organized by the socialist and communist parties of the Philippines on November 7, 1938 where both parties officially merged as one, taking the name “Communist Party of the Philippines”, which was later renamed Communist Party of the Philippines-1930 (PKP-1930), in order to avoid confusion with the splinter group of the same name. \nThe theater served as the home for theater productions, operas and zarzuelas in the Manila area until the onset of World War II. Toribio Teodoro, then referred to as the \"shoe king of the Philippines\", acquired the property in 1942 and used the MGOH as his residence during the Japanese occupation and the Second Philippine Republic, at which his house and shoe factory were seized by Japanese forces. Floods and a fire damaged the theater in 1943 and 1944, respectively, with reconstruction efforts commencing after the war.\n\nBy the 1950s, the theater, equipped with state-of-the-art equipment for both theatrical and cinematic productions, was dubbed its famous title \"The Theater with a History\". It provided daily entertainment for Manila residents, charging 85 centavos for admission to one theatrical production and one movie. In addition to plays and movie showings, balagtasan, operas, concerts and \"bodabil\" (vaudeville) performances were occasionally staged in the complex.\n\nOwnership of the complex shifted from the heirs of Teodoro to former Philippine Ambassador to Laos Antonio Cabangon Chua in the 1960s, by which then the MGOH had become a cinema. Part of Cabangon Chua's plan for the complex include the construction of a hotel at the complex.\n\nAs economic activity shifted from the Avenida area to Makati City in the 1970s, the MGOH was converted into what was then dubbed the largest nightclub in Manila: \"Chicks O'Clock\", catering to the working class near the Avenida area. The continued slump in Avenida eventually forced the closure of the club and the demolition of the theater.\n\nPartially fulfilling Cabangon Chua's vision for the site and as a contribution to the revival of the Avenida area, the Manila Grand Opera Hotel was constructed on the site of the former MGOH. The eight-storey hotel opened in August 2008, with its second building opening sometime in 2009. It will be the only hotel with a direct connection to the Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1, connecting to Doroteo Jose LRT Station, which is also rumored to be constructed on the MGOH grounds.\n\n\n"}

It was the home ground of Rotherham County F.C. between 1907 and 1925 and then their successors Rotherham United F.C. until 2008. The stadium has had no professional tenant since, but has been in use again for local youth football since 2016.\n\nThe stadium was in use during the 1890s, with Rotherham Church Institute using the ground in the Sheffield Association League. and presently has a capacity of around 8,300. Redevelopment work was started on the ground, with a new main stand being built in place of the previous wooden main stand which was built in the 1950s. The new stand was planned to contain corporate facilities and bring the capacity back to over 10,000. The work was scheduled to finish in 2006, but has faced a series of setbacks, one of which was Japanese knotweed being found on the site. Rotherham United have now moved to a new community stadium. In May 2011 Rotherham Titans and Rotherham Council announced a plan to allow the rugby union club to move into Millmoor. After much speculation it was announced in December 2011 that the Titans would remain at Clifton Lane for the foreseeable future due to the deal falling through.\n\nMillmoor hosted a number of memorable Rotherham United games including a first leg of the inaugural Football League Cup final against Aston Villa in 1961, which Rotherham won 2–0.\n\nOn 22 September 2007, for Rotherham United's game against Notts County, it was a special day to celebrate 100 years at Millmoor. The game ended 1–1, with Peter Holmes scoring for the Millers. There were special articles in the matchday programme and a commemorative cover. There were balloons all around Millmoor, with the Millers' badge, and the words '100 Years at Millmoor'. Fans were urged to wear retro Rotherham United shirts in order to be entered into a raffle. Many fans were seen with new scarves with Rotherham United F.C. on one side and 1907-2007 on the other side.\n\nIn May 2008, Rotherham United were forced to leave Millmoor after talks with Ken Booth, owner of Millmoor, broke down. The team played in the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield until 2012, when the club moved into a new community stadium in Rotherham. Millmoor is currently used by Westfield United of The Bud Evans BD U18 Division 5\n\nThe Tivoli was a favourite amongst the fans. The stand holds up to 2,700. It was a former terrace but was later seated during the club's time in the Football League Championship.\n\nThe Railway End is the away fans section where over 2,000 fans can be accommodated. This end is covered and all seated. An unusual feature is that away fans can only access this end by going down Millmoor Lane, which is a narrow alleyway. The acoustics on the railway end are said to be some of the best and fans can generate a lot of noise. If needed, away fans can be given additional seats in a section of the Millmoor Lane stand.\n\nThe railway referred to in the stand's name is the now closed line to the former Rotherham Westgate railway station.\n\nRedevelopment work was started on this stand, however that work has now ceased and in November 2007 the club confirmed that it had no intentions to complete this stand or modernise any part of the stadium due to the difficulty in reaching a deal to purchase the land surrounding Millmoor from the previous chairman. This dispute later led to Rotherham United moving away from the stadium. The stand remains partly finished.\n\nOpposite to the Main Stand is the Millmoor Lane side of the ground. It is split up into three sections:\n\nGreyhound racing took place at Millmoor Stadium from 11 May 1931 until 29 July 1933. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track which was the nickname given to independent tracks.\n"}

It is the home stadium for the Syracuse Mets Triple-A baseball team of the International League. The stadium, owned and at times operated by Onondaga County, opened on April 10, 1997, replacing the aging MacArthur Stadium which had served as home to Syracuse's professional baseball teams since 1934 and which was demolished in 1997.\n\nThe stadium is home to the Syracuse Mets, the Triple-A affiliate of the New York Mets. The field's outfield dimensions are to left field, to center field, and to right field.\nThe stadium has an official seating capacity of 11,071 people. In addition to regular seating, the stadium also offers luxury suites and a banquet room. The luxury suites are available in three different sized configurations and all include indoor and outdoor seating options as well as optional stadium-provided catering. The stadium's banquet room is named after former baseball player Hank Sauer who was with the then Syracuse Chiefs in the 1940s prior to going on to excel in the Major Leagues into the late 1950s and eventually have his number retired by the team. The room is near the right field foul pole and is available to rent year-round.\n\nSeating is broken down into the following: 280 in the 20 luxury suites, 3,000 in the 300 (upper) level, and 7,791 in the lower level.\n\nFrom its opening through the 2007 season, the stadium's playing surface was AstroTurf, mainly due to the team's then-affiliation with the Toronto Blue Jays who used the artificial surface in their ballpark. However, after the 2007 season, the Astro Turf was removed and replaced with natural grass.\n\nA record for baseball attendance was set May 7, 2010, when 14,098 people came to the park for Stephen Strasburg's Triple-A debut.\n\nOn March 20, 2012, the Syracuse Chiefs announced a new videoboard would be installed by the time the Chiefs took on the Durham Bulls on May 7, 2012. The screen measures 30' X 55' (LED High Definition display), making it one of the largest video boards in the minor leagues. The stadium's PA system also was upgraded.\n\nThe former soccer club Syracuse Salty Dogs of the United Soccer Leagues' A-League also called the stadium home for two seasons. Though they were very popular with fans and had very high attendance, their relationships with the Chiefs and Onondaga County were not positive and the team ceased operations after their second season.\n\nIn 2009, the stadium played host to the first two national concerts held at the stadium since 2000 when The Allman Brothers Band played there.\n\nOn July 19, 2009, the stadium hosted 7,124 fans who came to see Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, and John Mellencamp perform.\n\nTwo weeks after the Bob Dylan concert, on August 4, Dave Matthews Band was scheduled to perform at the stadium. Stadium management said they used lessons learned during the smaller-scale Dylan show to make the much larger-scale Dave Matthews Band show as smooth as possible. The show drew over 18,000 fans and was considered a great success, possibly paving the way for more concerts at the stadium in the years to come.\n\nFollowing the success of the 2008 and 2009 NHL Winter Classic outdoor hockey games, Syracuse Crunch owner Howard Dolgan started expressing his interest in holding a similar event in Syracuse. Alliance Bank stadium was the logical location to hold such an event since it is the only outdoor professional sports venue in the area. The Crunch estimated the cost of such an event to be between $850,000 and $1.05 million.\n\nThat being the case, Dolgan decided to ask the Onondaga County legislature for some financial help in putting on the event. Dolgan argued that since the event was expected to bring many out of town hockey fans to Syracuse, the county could use $350,000 of money set aside \"specifically to promote tourism and to attract out-of-town dollars to Syracuse\". The money in that fund is collected as a tax on hotel rooms in the county and could be replenished by the people coming in from out-of-town for the hockey game. However, the legislature voted 16-2 to not provide the $350,000 in funding and instead approved a total $75,000 in funding. Prior to the legislature's vote, Dolgan stated publicly that without the $350,000, the game would not go on. After the vote, Dolgan immediately turned the money down, stating: We're not doing an outdoor game. I'll tell ya, besides disappointing the fans and, of course, our organization, I can tell you about 10–12 prominent companies in Syracuse who are not going to be happy because the idiots who voted the way they did. And I don't mind saying that word. What are they going to do? Get mad at me and vote against something else I want to do?\n\nEventually, the game was held at the New York State Fairgrounds on Saturday, February 20, 2010, as the \"Mirabito Outdoor Classic\".\n\nDuring the 2009 International League Season, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders (then known as the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees) were forced to postpone 11 games due to drainage problems at their home park, PNC Field. In an effort to allow groundskeepers ample time to repair the field, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre decided to relocate four of their home games. Two of these games, both against the Buffalo Bisons, were moved to Syracuse.\n\nConstruction on the stadium was completed in 1997, at a total cost of approximately $28 million.\n\nAccording to \"The Post-Standard\" newspaper, financing for stadium construction included:\n\n\nIn 2012, the Community Baseball Club of Central New York (Syracuse Chiefs) signed an 11-year lease of the stadium with Onondaga County, starting at $126,000 per year, and increasing two percent per year through 2022, when it would pay $153,576. The Chiefs and County share maintenance, utility and other costs, with the former contributing about $500,000 per year to stadium upkeep.\n\nIn its prior, 15-year lease, the Baseball Club paid no rent, but its $4 million contribution to the construction of the stadium was amortized over the term of the lease, in lieu of rent, amounting to about $22,222 per month ($266,664 per year).\n\nThe Community Baseball Club had an \"option to buy\" the stadium from Onondaga County \"by the end of 2013\", at a price of $3.05 million.\n\nNBT Bank pays Onondaga County $140,000 per year for stadium naming rights. The 20-year agreement continues through 2025. Jack Webb, executive vice president of NBT Bank and former president of Alliance Bank, serves on the board of directors of the Community Baseball Club of Central New York, Inc., owners of the Syracuse Chiefs and current operator of NBT Bank Stadium.\n\nPreviously, the stadium was known as \"P&C Stadium\", derived from P&C Foods, the regional brand of supermarkets run by then Syracuse-based Penn Traffic Corporation (1997–2005); and \"Alliance Bank Stadium\" (2005–2013). In 2013, Alliance Bank merged with NBT Bank, which agreed to carry on the naming rights agreement.\n\nThe stadium's high-definition digital video screen, installed in 2012, was purchased by the Chiefs with a bank loan of $950,000, with Community Baseball Club investments as collateral; and with a County contribution of $200,000. The loan was due January 31, 2014.\n\nIn August 2018 the New York Mets and Onondaga County discussed a renovation which could reduce seating capacity by a third while adding a greater array of amenities, with an eye toward extending the team's commitment to NBT Bank Stadium beyond the 2025 season. At the same time, some local officials raised the possibility of constructing a new downtown ballpark.\n\n"}

Founded in 1937 with the construction of Supachalasai Stadium (; ), its main venue, the complex has since expanded and now consists of multiple stadia and sporting facilities.\n\nIt is used mostly for football matches. It served as the main stadium for the 1966, 1970, and 1978 Asian Games. It was also used for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, but only for one game (Oman v Iraq in Group A). The stadium is easy for spectators to get to as it is served by the BTS Skytrain which stops at the 'National Stadium BTS station' right next to the stadium.\n\nThe stadium is a single tier construction which is uncovered on three sides. A plain but effective roof covers the main-stand side. Although there is a running track, the tribunes are immediately adjacent to it so spectators are not as far from the action as they are at the newer Rajamangala Stadium. Spectator comfort was increased in 2007 with the addition of red bench seats to the previously bare concrete steps on the three open sides.\n\nThai league clubs often play at the Suphachalasai in Asian competitions as their own stadiums do not meet Asian Football Confederation criteria. However, it is now rarely used by the national team who usually play at the Rajamangala National Stadium. Other stadiums in Bangkok include the Thai Army Sports Stadium, the Thai-Japanese Stadium and Chulalongkorn University Stadium.\n\n\nSuphachalasai Stadium is the majority part of the National Stadium. It is the multi-purpose stadium with track and field for athletic purposes, as well as a partial roof on one of its side. With its capacity of 19,793, the stadium is being used to hold important matches such as the Thai FA Cup and Thai League Cup.\n\nThephasadin Stadium was constructed in 1965 for the use in 1966 Asian Games as the Hockey venue, hence its original name, Hockey Field. It was renamed in 1983 in memorial of Sanan Thephasadin na Ayutthaya, considered the Father of Thai Football. With its capacity of 6,378 seats, it was retired from being the hockey stadium.\n\nJindarat Stadium, constructed after the Pacific War, was formerly used as the outdoor stadium for medium-level sporting events and practicing purposes. It was originally named \"Ton Pho Stadium\", but was renamed in 1983 in memorial of Jindarat (Jamlong Sawat-chuto), former director of the Office of Sports and Recreation Development.\n\nWisutamol Pool was constructed in 1961 under the term of director Kong Wisutamol. It was the Olympic-size swimming pool with two sides of stands, used for the competition and general practices. Originally named the Olympic Pool, it was renamed in memorial of the director Wisutamol who organized the construction.\n\nNimibutr Stadium, opened in 1963 is an indoor stadium used for sports including boxing, badminton, gymnastics, futsal, basketball and handball.\n\nJhanthana-Yingyong Gymnasium was built in 1965.\n\n"}

The ground is home to the Newcastle Knights (National Rugby League) and Newcastle Jets FC (A-League). It is owned by the New South Wales government and administered by the Hunter Region Sporting Venues Authority. Due to past sponsorship deals, the ground has been previously known as Marathon Stadium, EnergyAustralia Stadium, Ausgrid Stadium and Hunter Stadium. Newcastle International Sports Centre is also known as Newcastle Stadium when in use during AFC competitions due to conflicting sponsorship reasons.\n\nWork began on the stadium on 1 December 1967, and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 10 April 1970. It was originally known as the \"International Sports Centre\", and is still part of the ISC complex to this day. The playing surface back then was originally oval shaped to allow both codes of rugby, soccer and cricket to be able to make use of it.\n\nThe Knights secured a lease on the stadium in 1986, and converted it from an oval to a rectangle layout. During the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour, the Newcastle Knights, in their first season, hosted a match at the ground. On that occasion the Lions, captained by Ellery Hanley, defeated the Knights 28–12.\n\nIn 1992, local tyre outlet Marathon Tyres became the naming rights sponsor for the stadium, and it was renamed \"Marathon Stadium\". That year the Knights played Great Britain for a second time as part of the Lions Tour of Australasia. The Ellery Hanley captained Lions took the Knights apart winning 22–0. Later in the 1992 NSWRL season, the Knights qualified for their first ever Finals series.\n\nTowards the end of 2001, energy supplier EnergyAustralia took over naming rights, and thus the stadium became \"EnergyAustralia Stadium\". In February 2011 it was announced that the stadium would be renamed to \"Ausgrid Stadium\" after EnergyAustralia was renamed \"Ausgrid\".\n\nBefore redevelopment, the stadium had a capacity of 28,000, including 5,000 in the main grandstand. The ground attendance record for a sporting event is 32,642, which was set when the Knights took on the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in July 1995. Despite a lack of incidents, police subsequently asked for the allowed capacity to be lowered for reasons of safety.\n\nFollowing the retirement of former Knights captain Andrew Johns, the new eastern grandstand was renamed \"The Andrew Johns Stand\" in honour of Johns in front of a packed crowd before the Knights vs Brisbane Broncos NRL match on Sunday 22 April 2007.\n\nThe name (Newcastle International Sports Centre) is used primarily by those who wish to mention stadiums by original names, such as non-commercial organisations like the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and those with other corporate interests such as FIFA or the Asian Football Confederation.\n\nIn October 2016, McDonald Jones Homes, a local Newcastle company, was named as the new naming rights sponsor of the stadium. This new deal left behind a 5 year gap between naming rights sponsors at the ground.\n\nThe stadium underwent redevelopment during the years 2003–05, funded mostly by local and state government grants.\n\nFactors that brought on the redevelopment included:\n\nThe first stage of the redevelopment was completed in early 2004. This consisted of;\n\nThe second stage of construction began in 2004 and was completed in 2005. This consisted of:\n\nDuring the 2007 NSW Election campaign, the Premier Morris Iemma promised $30 million towards an upgrade of the stadium, conditional on the Federal Government matching the funds.\n\nOn 1 April 2008 the federal government confirmed $10m towards the development of the Western Grandstand. This is in addition to the $30m commitment from the state government. This is a critical step for the stadium's development for the upgrade to be in by 2011. The A$40 million will contribute to an expansion of the stadium's capacity to eventually hold over 40,000 as well as general improvements in the stadiums facilities.\n\nFrom 2008–10 the stadium is being upgraded again to around 33 000 seats, with a hope for the stadium to be involved in the 2015 Asian Cup and 2018 World Cup should Australia be the host of those tournaments. As part of the announcement, Morris Iemma stated that the capacity of 33,000 can be increased to the 40,000 necessary for World Cup Hosting, through temporary seating. The total cost of the upgrade is $60 million, with $50 million from the state government and $10 million from the Federal Government.\nAlthough construction will take place during both the Newcastle Knights and Newcastle Jets seasons, developers have stated that there will be minimal effect on attendances due to the staged approach.\n\nThe stadium development is being carried out over four stages.\n\n\nThe Newcastle Knights of the National Rugby League team have been tenants of the ground since their formation in 1988.\n\nIn October 2011 the ground hosted a rugby league one-off test match between Australia and New Zealand. This event set a new ground attendance record for a sporting event of 32,890.\n\nDuring the National Soccer League competition, three clubs have played their home ground games at this stadium. They are Newcastle KB United (1978–84); Newcastle Rosebud United (1984–86) and Newcastle United (2000–04). The NSL competition folded in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, the newly formed national competition (A-League) began to operate. Newcastle United Jets was part of the newly formed competition, and have played at this ground ever since.\n\nThe stadium also hosted two 2015 AFC Asian Cup group stage matches, and also a semi final between Australia and the United Arab Emirates and a third place playoff between United Arab Emirates and Iraq.\n\nIn February 2017 it was announced that the National Premier Leagues Northern NSW Grand Final would be taking place at the ground in September that year. In the Grand Final between the Edgeworth Eagles and Lambton Jaffas a crowd of 4174 was on hand to see the Jaffas clinch the title beating the Eagles 2-0 deep into Extra Time.\n\nThe 2018 A-League Grand Final was held at the venue, contested by the Newcastle Jets and Melbourne Victory, on 5 May 2018.\n\nThe Hunter Eagles were formed for the 1994–95 Australian Baseball League season after purchasing the Sydney Wave's licence. The Eagles played in the Australian Baseball League until the end of the 1997–98 season.\n\nIn 2012, it was used for the first match of the 2012 Scotland rugby union tour of Oceania. Scotland won the match, beating Australia 9–6.\n\nThe New South Wales Waratahs have announced they will play a home fixture of their Super Rugby season from 2019 in Newcastle whilst the New Sydney Football Stadium is under construction.\n\nThe venue has hosted three Australia internationals and one Rugby League World Cup game. The results were as follows; Hunter Stadium has also been chosen as the host venue for the 2016 Anzac Test between Australia and New Zealand on 6 May.\nThe Newcastle Knights twice hosted the Great Britain Lions at the stadium.\n"}

{"id": "27676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27676", "title": "Shuttlecock", "text": "Shuttlecock\n\nA shuttlecock (also called a bird or birdie) is a high-drag projectile used in the sport of badminton. It has an open conical shape formed by feathers (or a synthetic alternative) embedded into a rounded cork (or rubber) base. The shuttlecock's shape makes it extremely aerodynamically stable. Regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork first, and remain in the cork-first orientation.\n\nThe name 'shuttlecock' originates in Victorian times, when badminton first became popular. It is frequently shortened to shuttle. The \"shuttle\" part of the name was probably derived from its back-and-forth motion during the game, resembling the shuttle of a loom, while the \"cock\" part of the name was probably derived from the resemblance of the feathers to those on a rooster.\n\nA shuttlecock weighs around . It has 16 feathers with each feather in length. The diameter of the cork is and the diameter of the circle that the feathers make is around .\n\nA shuttlecock is formed from 16 or so overlapping feathers, usually goose or duck, embedded into a rounded cork base. The cork is covered with thin leather. To ensure satisfactory flight properties, it is considered preferable to use feathers from right or left wings only in each shuttlecock, and not mix feathers from different wings, as the feathers from different wings are shaped differently. \n\nThe feathers are brittle; shuttlecocks break easily and often need to be replaced several times during a game. For this reason, synthetic shuttlecocks have been developed that replace the feathers with a plastic skirt. Players often refer to synthetic shuttlecocks as \"plastics\" and feathered shuttlecocks as \"feathers\".\n\nFeather shuttles need to be properly humidified for at least 4 hours prior to play in order to fly the correct distance at the proper speed and to last longer. Properly humidified feathers flex during play, enhancing the shuttle's speed change and durability. Dry feathers are brittle and break easily, causing the shuttle to wobble. Saturated feathers are 'mushy', making the feather cone narrow too much when strongly hit, which causes the shuttle to fly overly far and fast. Humidification boxes are often used, but a simple moist sponge inserted in the feather end of the closed shuttle tube will work nicely. Water should never touch the cork of the shuttle. Shuttles are tested prior to play to make sure they fly true and at the proper speed, and cover the proper distance. Different weights of shuttles are used to compensate for local atmospheric conditions. Both humidity and height above sea level affect shuttle flight. World Badminton Federation Rules say the shuttle should reach the far doubles service line plus or minus half the width of the tram. According to manufacturers (!) proper shuttle will generally travel from the back line of the court to just short of the long doubles service line on the opposite side of the net, with a full underhand hit from an average player.\n\nThe cost of good quality feathers is similar to that of good quality plastics, but plastics are far more durable, typically lasting many matches without any impairment to their flight. Shuttles are easily damaged and should be replaced every three or four games, and sooner if they are damaged and do not fly straight. This interferes with the game, as the impairment on the flight of the shuttle may misdirect the direction of the shuttlecock.\n\nMost experienced and skillful players greatly prefer feathers, and serious tournaments or leagues are always played using feather shuttlecocks of the highest quality. Experienced players generally prefer the \"feel\" of feathered shuttlecocks and assert that they are able to control the flight of feathers better than that of plastics. In Asia, where feather shuttlecocks are more affordable than in Europe and North America, plastic shuttlecocks are hardly used at all.\n\nThe playing characteristics of plastics and feathers are substantially different. Plastics fly more slowly on initial impact, but slow down less towards the end of their flight. While feathers tend to drop straight down on a clear shot, plastics never quite return to a straight drop, falling more on a diagonal. Feather shuttles may come off the strings at speeds in excess of 320 km/h (200 mph) but slow down faster as they drop. For this reason, the feather shuttle makes the game seem faster, but also allows more time to play strokes. Because feather shuttles fly more quickly off the racquet face they also tend to cause less shoulder impact and injury. Shuttle game is a physically rigorous game needing to run, bend quickly and played indoor as either a singles or as doubles game.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20128213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20128213", "title": "The Hunger Games (novel)", "text": "The Hunger Games (novel)\n\nThe Hunger Games is a 2008 dystopian novel by the American writer Suzanne Collins. It is written in the voice of 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the future, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem in North America. The Capitol, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games is an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12–18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death.\n\nThe book received critical acclaim from major reviewers and authors. It was praised for its plot and character development. In writing \"The Hunger Games\", Collins drew upon Greek mythology, Roman gladiatorial games, and contemporary reality television for thematic content. The novel won many awards, including the California Young Reader Medal, and was named one of \"Publishers Weekly\"s \"Best Books of the Year\" in 2008.\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" was first published in hardcover on September 14, 2008, by Scholastic, featuring a cover designed by Tim O'Brien. It has since been released in paperback and also as an audiobook and ebook. After an initial print of 200,000, the book had sold 800,000 copies by February 2010. Since its release, \"The Hunger Games\" has been translated into 26 languages, and publishing rights have been sold in 38 territories. The novel is the first in \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy, followed by \"Catching Fire\" (2009) and \"Mockingjay\" (2010). A film adaptation, directed by Gary Ross and co-written and co-produced by Collins herself, was released in 2012.\n\nCollins has said that the inspiration for \"The Hunger Games\" came from channel surfing on television. On one channel she observed people competing on a reality show and on another she saw footage of the invasion of Iraq. The two \"began to blur in this very unsettling way\" and the idea for the book was formed. The Greek myth of Theseus served as a major basis for the story, with Collins describing Katniss as a futuristic Theseus, and Roman gladiatorial games provided the framework. The sense of loss that Collins developed through her father's service in the Vietnam War was also an influence on the story, with Katniss having lost her father at age 11, five years before the story begins. Collins stated that the deaths of young characters and other \"dark passages\" were the most difficult parts of the book to write, but that she had accepted that passages such as these were necessary to the story. She considered the moments where Katniss reflects on happier moments in her past to be more enjoyable.\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" takes place in a nation known as Panem, established in North America after the destruction of the continent's civilization by an unknown apocalyptic event. The nation consists of the wealthy Capitol and twelve surrounding, poorer districts under the Capitol's dictatorial control. The Capitol exploits the districts for their natural resources and cheap labour. District 12 is in the coal-rich region that was once Appalachia, while the Capitol is in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nAs punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, a contest in which the \"tributes\" must fight to the death in an outdoor arena until only one remains. The event is televised.\n\nThe story is narrated by 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, a girl from District 12 who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games in place of her 12-year-old sister, Primrose. The male tribute is Peeta Mellark, a former schoolmate of Katniss who once gave her bread from his family's bakery when her family was starving.\n\nKatniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol. In the few days before the Games start, they are advised and supported by a team consisting of their drunken mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; Effie Trinket; and two fashion stylists and three prep workers who help each tribute look his or her best. Katniss's stylist, Cinna, is the only person at the Capitol she considers a friend. They are also introduced to the general public, given some training, and evaluated by the Gamemakers. Katniss and, to a lesser extent, Peeta set themselves apart from the other tributes. Rue, the petite 12-year-old girl tribute from District 11, takes to following them around.\n\nEach tribute is interviewed on television by Caesar Flickerman; they use the opportunity to try to obtain \"sponsors\", who can send them potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. In his interview, Peeta reveals his longtime unrequited love for Katniss. At first, Katniss believes this is simply a ploy to gain sponsors and make her let her guard down. (Much later, she comes to accept he is sincere.) Haymitch promotes their image as \"star-crossed lovers\".\n\nNearly half the tributes are killed in the first day of the Games, fighting over the weapons and supplies strewn around their starting point. Katniss nearly dies, ignoring Haymitch's advice to flee immediately. She uses her well-practiced hunting and survival skills to hide in the woods. A few days later, an artificial fire drives Katniss toward the others. She is spotted and treed by the \"Careers\" (tributes from the richer, loyal districts who have trained intensively for the Games) ... and Peeta, who seems to have allied with them. Rue is hiding in a nearby tree. Silently, she directs Katniss's attention to a tracker jacker nest. Katniss saws through the branch holding the nest, sending it plummeting down. The venom of the flying insects kills one girl and drives the others away. However, Katniss is stung herself and begins hallucinating. Peeta returns, but instead of killing her, he tells her to run away.\n\nShe and Rue become allies and friends, but Rue is later fatally wounded by another tribute, whom Katniss kills with an arrow. Katniss sings to Rue until she dies and spreads flowers over the body to show her defiance against the Capitol. In an unprecedented move, Rue's district sends Katniss a gift of bread.\n\nThen a rule change is announced, allowing the tributes from the same district to win as a couple. Katniss finds and nurses a seriously wounded Peeta, while continuing to act the part of a girl in love to gain gifts. When the Gamemakers announce that what each contestant needs most will be provided at a feast, Katniss risks her life to obtain medicine for Peeta. She is pinned to the ground by Clove, who gloats about Rue while toying with the helpless Katniss. That talk costs Clove her life, however; Thresh, the male District 11 tribute, kills her, but spares Katniss - once - for Rue's sake. The medicine saves Peeta's life.\n\nFinally, Katniss and Peeta are the last two survivors, but the Gamemakers cancel the rule change in an attempt to force them into a dramatic finale, in which one must kill the other. Instead, Katniss defiantly retrieves highly poisonous \"nightlock\" berries and offers half to Peeta. Realizing that Katniss and Peeta intend to commit suicide, the Gamemakers announce that they are the victors of the 74th Hunger Games.\n\nAlthough she receives a hero's welcome, Katniss is warned by Haymitch that she has now become a target after defying the Capitol so publicly. Afterward, Peeta is heartbroken when he learns that her actions in the arena were part of a calculated ploy to gain sympathy from the audience. However, Katniss is unsure of her own feelings.\n\nIn an interview with Collins, it was noted that the novel \"tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war among others.\" The novel deals with the struggle for self-preservation that the people of Panem face in their districts and the Hunger Games in which they must participate. The citizens' starvation and their need for resources, both in and outside of the arena, create an atmosphere of helplessness that the main characters try to overcome in their fight for survival. Katniss needs to hunt to provide food for her family, resulting in the development of skills that are useful to her in the Games (such as her proficiency with the bow and arrow), and represents her rejection of the Capitol's rules in the face of life-threatening situations. On the subject of the Games' parallels with popular culture, Darren Franich of \"Entertainment Weekly\" writes that the book \"is an incisive satire of reality television shows\", and that the character of Cinna \"almost seems like a contestant on a fascist version of \"Project Runway\", using Katniss' outfits as a vehicle to express potentially dangerous ideas.\"\n\nThe choices the characters make and the strategies they use are often morally complex. The tributes build a personality they want the audience to see throughout the Games. Library journal \"Voice of Youth Advocates\" names the major themes of \"The Hunger Games\" as \"government control, 'big brother', and personal independence.\" The trilogy's theme of power and downfall, similar to that of Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\", was pointed out by its publisher Scholastic. Laura Miller of \"The New Yorker\" finds the author's stated premise of the Games –an exercise in propaganda and a \"humiliating as well as torturous [...] punishment\" for a failed uprising against the Capitol many years earlier– to be unconvincing. \"You don't demoralize and dehumanize a subject people by turning them into celebrities and coaching them on how to craft an appealing persona for a mass audience.\" But the story works much better if the theme is vicissitudes of high school and \"the adolescent social experience\". Miller writes:\n\"The rules are arbitrary, unfathomable, and subject to sudden change. A brutal social hierarchy prevails, with the rich, the good-looking, and the athletic lording their advantages over everyone else. To survive you have to be totally fake. Adults don't seem to understand how high the stakes are; your whole life could be over, and they act like it's just some \"phase\"! Everyone's always watching you, scrutinizing your clothes or your friends and obsessing over whether you're having sex or taking drugs or getting good enough grades, but no one cares who you really are or how you really feel about anything.\"\n\nDonald Brake from \"The Washington Times\" and pastor Andy Langford state that the story has Christian themes, such as that of self-sacrifice, which is found in Katniss' substitution for her younger sister, analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus as a substitute for the atonement of sins. Brake, as well as another reviewer, Amy Simpson, both find that the story also revolves around the theme of hope, which is exemplified in the \"incorruptible goodness of Katniss' sister, Primrose.\" Simpson also points to events similar to the Passion of Jesus; in the Games, \"Christ figure\" Peeta Mellark is stabbed after warning Katniss to flee for her life, and is then buried in the ground and placed in a cave for three days before emerging with a new lease on life. Further, she finds that the Christian image of the Bread of Life is used throughout \"The Hunger Games\"; in the story, Peeta gives Katniss a loaf of bread, saving the girl and her family from starvation.\n\nAfter writing the novel, Collins signed a six-figure deal for three books with Scholastic. First published as a hardcover in the United States on September 14, 2008, \"The Hunger Games\" had a first printing of 50,000 copies, which was bumped up twice to 200,000 copies. By February 2010, the book had sold 800,000 copies, and rights to the novel had been sold in 38 territories worldwide. A few months later, in July, the book was released in paperback. \"The Hunger Games\" entered the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list in November 2008, where it would feature for over 100 consecutive weeks. By the time the film adaptation of \"The Hunger Games\" was released in March 2012, the book had been on \"USA Today\"s best-sellers list for 135 consecutive weeks and has sold over 17.5 million copies.\n\nThe novel is the first in \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy; it is followed by sequels \"Catching Fire\" (2009) and \"Mockingjay\" (2010). In March 2012, during the time of \"The Hunger Games\" film's release, Scholastic reported 26 million \"Hunger Games\" trilogy books in print, including movie tie-in books. \"The Hunger Games\" (and its sequels) have sold exceptionally well in ebook format. Suzanne Collins is the first children's or young adult author to sell over one million Amazon Kindle ebooks, making her the sixth author to join the \"Kindle Million Club\". In March 2012, Amazon announced that Collins had become the best-selling Kindle ebook author of all time.\n\nAn audiobook version of \"The Hunger Games\" was released in December 2008. Read by the actress Carolyn McCormick, it has a total running time of eleven hours and fourteen minutes. The magazine \"AudioFile\" said: \"Carolyn McCormick gives a detailed and attentive narration. However, she may rely too much on the strength of the prose without providing the drama young adult listeners often enjoy.\" \"School Library Journal\" also praised the audiobook, stating that \"McCormick ably voices the action-packed sequences and Katniss's every fear and strength shines through, along with her doomed growing attraction to one of her fellow Tributes.\"\n\nThe Tim O'Brien-designed cover features a gold \"mockingjay\" – a fictional bird in \"The Hunger Games\" born by crossbreeding female mockingbirds and genetically engineered male \"jabberjays\" – with an arrow engraved in a circle. This is a depiction of the pin worn by Katniss into the arena, given to her by the District 12 mayor's daughter, Madge Undersee. The image matches the description of the pin that is given in the novel, except for the arrow: \"It's as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips.\"\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" has received critical acclaim. In a review for \"The New York Times\", John Green wrote that the novel was \"brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced\", and that \"the considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins's convincingly detailed world-building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine.\" However, he also noted that, while allegorically rich, the book sometimes does not realize the allegorical potential that the plot has to offer and that the writing \"described the action and little else.\" \"Time\" magazine's review was also positive, stating that it \"is a chilling, bloody and thoroughly horrifying book\" and praising what it called the \"hypnotic\" quality of the violence. In Stephen King's review for \"Entertainment Weekly\", he compared it to \"shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway.\" However, he stated that there were \"displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults\" and that the love triangle was standard for the genre. He gave the book a B grade. Elizabeth Bird of \"School Library Journal\" praised the novel, saying it is \"exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns\", and called it one of the best books of 2008. \"Booklist\" also gave a positive review, praising the character violence and romance involved in the book. \"Kirkus Reviews\" gave a positive review, praising the action and world-building, but pointed out that \"poor copyediting in the first printing will distract careful readers–a crying shame\". Rick Riordan, author of the \"Percy Jackson & the Olympians\" series, claims it is the \"closest thing to a perfect adventure novel\" he has ever read. Stephenie Meyer (author of the \"Twilight\" series) endorsed the book on her website, saying, \"I was so obsessed with this book ...\n\"The Hunger Games\" is amazing.\"\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" received many awards and honors. It was named one of \"Publishers Weekly\" \"Best Books of the Year\" in 2008 and a \"The New York Times\" \"Notable Children's Book of 2008\". It was the 2009 winner of the Golden Duck Award in the Young Adult Fiction Category. \"The Hunger Games\" was also a \"2008 Cybil Winner\" for fantasy and science-fiction books along with \"The Graveyard Book\", one of \"School Library Journal\"s \"Best Books 2008\", and a \"Booklist Editors' Choice\" in 2008. In 2011, the book won the California Young Reader Medal. In the 2012 edition of Scholastic's \"Parent and Child\" magazine, \"The Hunger Games\" was listed as the 33rd-best book for children, with the award for \"Most Exciting Ending\". The novel is one of the top 5 best selling Kindle books of all time. However, the novel has also been controversial with parents; it ranked in fifth place on the American Library Association's list of frequently challenged books for 2010, with \"unsuited to age group\" and \"violence\" being among the reasons cited.\n\nSimilarities of \"The Hunger Games\" to Koushun Takami's 1999 novel \"Battle Royale\" have been noted. Collins stated that she \"had never heard of that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was mentioned to me, and I asked my editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing'.\" Susan Dominus of \"The New York Times\" reports that \"the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff\" of \"Battle Royale\" but argued that \"there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently.\" Stephen King noted that the reality TV \"badlands\" were similar to \"Battle Royale\", as well as his own novels \"The Running Man\" and \"The Long Walk\".\n\nIn March 2009, Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement for \"The Hunger Games\" with Nina Jacobson's production company Color Force, which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier. The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000 – one of its largest ever – for the film. Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that \"they [Lionsgate] had everyone but the valet call us\" to help secure the franchise. Intending the film to have a PG-13 rating, Collins adapted the novel for film herself, in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he \"felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective\" in its presentation of events, echoing Collins' use of first person present in the novel.\n\nTwenty-year-old actress Jennifer Lawrence was chosen to play Katniss Everdeen. Though Lawrence was four years older than the character when filming began, Collins felt the role demanded \"a certain maturity and power\" and said she would rather the actress be older than younger. She added that Lawrence was the \"only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book\" and that she had \"every essential quality necessary to play Katniss.\" Lawrence, a fan of the books, took three days to accept the role, initially intimidated by the size of the production. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth were later added to the cast, in the roles of Peeta and Gale, respectively. Production began in late spring 2011 and the film was released on March 23, 2012. The film's opening weekend brought in a non-sequel record $152.5 million (USD) in North America. \"\", based on the second novel in the series, was released the following year on November 22, 2013.\n\n"}

{"id": "46676322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46676322", "title": "Transgender people in sports", "text": "Transgender people in sports\n\nThe participation of transgender or transsexual individuals in competitive sports is a controversial issue. Opposition to transgender or transsexual individuals competing in sporting events generally focuses on hormonal factors (such as higher testosterone levels among trans women), the socialisation of young men and women, and physiological factors such as height and weight. Insisting trans athletes compete against athletes of the same biological sex, sex verification testing, and access regulations have been used with the aim of ensuring fair competition.\n\nHistorically sport has been seen as a male domain. The masculine perception of sport was first moderated with the rise of women's sports and further challenged with the gradual acceptance of gay sportsmen. A third departure from this traditional view came from trans athletes, who did not fit into the culturally accepted binary gender definition of male and female.\n\nAn early high-profile transgender athlete was tennis player Renée Richards. Already a promising tennis player in the mens circuit, Richards underwent gender reassignment therapy in 1975 and started playing in women's tournaments a year later. Her discovery and the resulting media frenzy sparked protests. After she accepted an invitation to a warm-up tournament for the US Open the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) and the United States Tennis Association (USTA) withdrew their support and 25 of the 32 women withdrew.\n\nThe USTA and WTA introduced the Barr body test, which identifies a person's sex chromosomes. Richards refused to take the test and was banned from the US Open. She filed a lawsuit in 1977 claiming that her civil rights were violated. The judge agreed that the Barr body test as the sole determinant of sex was \"grossly unfair\" and ruled Richards legally female. She competed in the 1977 Open, lost in the first round and retired four years later. At the time, the ruling in Richards's case did not lead to major changes outside of tennis.\n\nIn 2003, a committee convened by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Medical Commission drew up new guidelines for participation of athletes who had undergone sex reassignment. The report listed three conditions for participation. First, athletes must have undergone sex reassignment surgery, including changes in the external genitalia and gonadectomy. Second, athletes must show legal recognition of their gender. Third, athletes must have undergone hormone therapy for an appropriate time before participation, with two years being the suggested time.\n\nIt was not until 2004 that the IOC allowed transsexual athletes to participate in the Olympic Games.\n\nIn 2015, the IOC modified these guidelines in recognition that legal recognition of gender could be difficult in countries where gender transition is not legal, and also that requiring surgery in otherwise healthy individuals \"may be inconsistent with developing legislation and notions of human rights\". The new guidelines require only that trans woman athletes declare their gender and not change that assertion for four years, and demonstrate a testosterone level of less than 10 nanomoles/liter for at least one year prior to competition and throughout the period of eligibility. Athletes who transitioned from female to male were allowed to compete without restriction. These guidelines were in effect for the 2016 Rio Olympics, although no openly transgender athletes competed.\n\nThe first out transgender person to make a US National Team was Chris Mosier who in 2016 qualified for Team USA in duathlon.\n\nIn 2017 Mack Beggs, a teenager from Texas that was transitioning from female to male, was forced to wrestle in the girls state championship despite wanting to wrestle against boys. This was due to state sport regulations requiring athletes to compete alongside athletes of their birth gender. Some opponents say the testosterone prescribed as part of his transition gives him an unfair advantage and made it unsafe for the other wrestlers.\n\nIn October 2018, Rachel McKinnon won a gold medal at the cycling Masters World Track Championship in Los Angeles. \n\nAt the heart of this controversy are concerns that transgender women would outperform cisgender women due to their more masculine body structure, socialisation as males and higher testosterone levels. The intense scrutiny of transgender athletes has focused on trans women because it is generally assumed that transitioning for transmasculine individuals would not confer a competitive advantage.\n\nSports organizations have sought a test for sex verification to ensure fairness across all sports. This began in the 1940s with \"femininity certificates\" provided by a physician. In the 1960s, visual genital inspections were used to confirm gender, followed by chromosomal analysis to ensure that all athletes had an XX or XY chromosomal makeup. These tests were all designed to ensure that athletes were only allowed to compete as their sex, but mostly resulted in the exclusion of intersex athletes.\n\nMore recently, testosterone levels have become the focus and, at the same time, new guidelines have been sought that would allow successfully-transitioned athletes to compete.\n\nPeople who oppose transgender women competing in women's sports say that they are given an unfair advantage over biological women due to their testosterone levels, and different muscle and fat distribution. Testosterone regulates many different functions in the body, including the maintenance of bone and muscle mass. It is also argued that athletes who transition to a woman after puberty will have a greater muscle to fat ratio compared to female athletes.\n\nHowever, the use of estrogen supplements and testosterone blockers (or physical castration via sex reassignment) cause a decrease in muscle mass, bone density, and oxygen-carrying red blood cells. This leads to a decrease in strength, speed, and endurance. According to Joanna Harper, a competitive runner, scientist, and transgender woman, every athlete has advantages and disadvantages. The greater height that a transgender woman may have gained before transitioning may be an advantage on the basketball court but it is likely to be disadvantageous to a gymnast. Eric Vilain, a professor of human genetics at UCLA and a consultant to the IOC medical commission, stated: \"There is 10 to 12% difference between male and female athletic performance. We need to categorize with criteria that are relevant to performance. It is a very difficult situation with no easy solution.\"\n\nStates vary widely on participation of transgender children in sports and which locker room those students should use. Advocates in favor of allowing transgender children to participate in sports based on their preferred gender point out the known benefits of participating in sports and the psychological well-being of the transgender children. Opponents emphasize the same issues of an unfair advantage of larger size and strength in trans women, plus the safety of cisgender children, both in competition and in the locker room.\n\n\n\nAcknowledged law and regulation research papers regarding policies around transgender athletes in competition:\n"}

{"id": "864510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=864510", "title": "York Park", "text": "York Park\n\nYork Park is a sports ground in the Inveresk and York Park Precinct, Launceston, Australia. Holding 21,000 people — the largest capacity stadium in Tasmania — York Park is known commercially as University of Tasmania Stadium and was formerly known as Aurora Stadium under a previous naming rights agreement signed with Aurora Energy in 2004. Primarily used for Australian rules football, its record attendance of 20,971 was set in June 2006, when Hawthorn Football Club played Richmond Football Club in an Australian Football League (AFL) match.\n\nThe area was swampland before becoming Launceston's showgrounds in 1873. In the following decades the grounds were increasingly used for sports, including cricket, bowls and tennis. In 1919, plans were prepared for the transformation of the area into a multi-sports venue. From 1923, the venue was principally used for Australian rules football by the Northern Tasmanian Football Association, and for occasional inter-state games. Visiting mainland football clubs regularly played mid-season or end-of-season matches at the ground. Other sports such as cricket, tennis, bowling, cycling and foot-racing have been played at the venue.\n\nHawthorn has played between two and five AFL matches each season since 2001, and the St Kilda Football Club played two games a year between 2003 and 2006. In 2007, the Tasmanian Government signed a $16.4 million, five-year sponsorship deal with Hawthorn, under which the club will play four regular season games and one National Australia Bank Cup pre-season match at the venue each year.\n\nThroughout its history, York Park has hosted major pop concerts and other entertainments. Since 2001 it has been a venue for international sports events, and in 2005 was redeveloped at a cost of $23.6 million. On 21 February 2009 York Park became home to the Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe area now known as York Park was originally \"swampy, sour, and choked with weeds\". After European settlement, it was used for landfill before becoming the Launceston showgrounds in 1874. By 1881, of land (now York and Invermay Parks) had been taken over by the Launceston City Council \"for the purpose of recreation, health and enjoyment\". The area was ready to be used for two cricket games by the end of 1886. Cricketers were full of praise for the ground, but because winter rain caused it to become waterlogged, footballers (Australian rules) were often unable to use the facility.\n\nAt a council meeting in July 1901, one member, Alderman Storrer, proposed that Inveresk Park be renamed York Park in honour of the Duke of York (later King George V), who visited Tasmania during the Federation celebrations of 1901. The proposal was passed 4–2, although another member, Alderman Sadler, noted that \"Launceston was well known as a loyal community and did not need to change the park's name\" to prove their fidelity to the monarchy. A bowling green and tennis courts were completed by 1910, along with the main oval which was used for state school sports.\nIn 1919, the council held a competition for the design of the York Park sports ground, the winner to receive £20. The final design had to include two full sized tennis courts, a bowling green, a cycling track, cricket and football grounds with dressing rooms and facilities for spectators. Although not fully complete, York Park was officially opened by the St Andrews Caledonian Society on 1 January 1921. A cycling track surrounding the perimeter fence was in use by September of the same year.\nOn 4 May 1923 \"The Examiner\" reported on that \"Work on the grandstand was completed for the opening of the 1923 football season, when the game was transferred from the NTCA Ground to York Park. Work on the grandstand and the seating round the oval has been proceeded with at top speed, and spectators at the game tomorrow should have little to complain of.\" The first game between teams representing the northern and southern halves of Tasmania took place at the oval in August 1923 in front of a crowd of 9,441. A reporter from \"The Examiner\" commented: \"The oval is in good order and well grassed and the new motor mower copes with the latter very effectively under favourable conditions. The whole five acres can be cut in six hours, as compared with twenty hours by the horse mower.\" When the ground was harrowed, glass and other debris would surface; a contemporary observer, John Orchard, later remembered: \"they'd line up a whole group of people, perhaps thirty or forty players, and we'd go along with a container alongside each other and we'd pick up everything that was likely to hurt a player.\" \n\nHeavy floods in 1929 caused substantial damage to the ground, destroying the cycling track, which was subsequently rebuilt. In the 1930s the Launceston Football Club, who played regularly at the ground, won six consecutive premierships before World War II intervened. As a consequence of the war NTFA matches were canceled after the 1941 season, not to resume until May 1945. Three years later, 12 ornamental trees were planted at the ground, in memory of NTFA players who had lost their lives in the war.\n\nIn 1960, York Park was the venue of a football match in which Tasmania defeated Victoria for the first time. The match was attended by a record crowd of approximately 15,000. Four years later, the southern stand (demolished in 2004) was completed. In the 1970s another stand was added, capable of holding 650 spectators and incorporating sales kiosks and committee rooms.\nUp to 1999 York Park had remained a sports ground used predominately for local events, generally attracting modest crowds; according to ground manager Robert Groenewegen, supporters were able to \"park [their] car[s] next to the boundary fence\".\nHowever, before the 1998 federal election the local member of parliament (MP) representing the Division of Bass, Warwick Smith—a minister from the ruling Liberal Party—promised public funding for the redevelopment of York Park. Although Smith lost his seat, the Liberals retained power and kept the promise. The $6.4 million redevelopment completed in 2000 was the first major phase in the process of raising the ground to Australian Football League (AFL) standard. Work included the construction of the Gunns Stand, a two-level grandstand originally holding 2,500 (now extended to 5,700) which incorporates corporate facilities. Other improvements added were five television standard light towers, a watering and drainage system able to disperse up to of rain an hour, and 85 in-ground sprinklers capable of rising .\n\nIn 2003, the Government of Tasmania allocated $2 million to erect a roof above 6,000 terrace seats, in readiness for the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup; this meant that almost all of the seating area was protected from the weather. In 2004, the ground became known as Aurora Stadium as the result of six-year naming rights sponsorship deal with Aurora Energy.\nDuring 2006, the state government supplied $150,000 for new gates and ticket boxes at the stadium entry. The gates were later named after recently deceased Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon. These gates, and the heritage-listed Northern Stand, have been placed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register as culturally significant to the state. The two-storey Cameron-Tyson stand was in 2005, replaced by an extension of the Gunns Stand.\n\nIn March 2008, an arson attack destroyed part of the Northern Stand, causing between $300,000 and $500,000 damage. In December 2008 the Launceston City Council proposed a $7 million development for a replacement Northern Stand. The project includes the relocation of the old Northern Stand's heritage roof into part of the redevelopment of facilities at Invermay Park. The old structure at York Park will be replaced with a 2,125-seat grandstand which will include three AFL compliant changerooms, an AFL umpire changeroom, a corporate facility for 936 people in corporate boxes, suites and function rooms, coaches boxes, along with statistician, timekeepers and print media rooms. Post-match press conference, drug testing, and radio rooms will also be included. The stand has increased the ground's capacity to 21,000 and the seating capacity to 13,825. These works where designed by Tasmanian-based architects Philp Lighton Architects. The Australian Government was expected to contribute $4 million, the Tasmanian Government $2 million and Launceston City Council $500,000. The Hawthorn Football Club are currently asking for a \"sizeable\" contribution from the AFL towards the development, and Inveresk Precinct Authority chairman Robin McKendrick has indicated that a contribution of $1 million was possible.\n\nOn 22 October 2016, the University of Tasmania bought the naming rights to the stadium for a five-year contract that would take effect on 1 January as the university campus would sit next to York Park, bringing an end to a 12-year partnership with Aurora Energy.\n\nAustralian rules football is the main sport played at the stadium which has hosted Australian Football League (AFL) games since 2001, when the state government started paying interstate clubs to relocate their home games. Melbourne-based Hawthorn played one game in 2001 and two in 2002, and in 2003 were joined by another Melbourne team, St Kilda. In 2004, it was estimated that the cost to the government per game was between $300,000 and $500,000, but Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon stated that the government was making a profit on its investment, estimating that each game injected between $1 million and $1.5 million into the Tasmanian economy.\n\nThe number of AFL matches peaked in 2006, when Hawthorn played three home games and one pre-season game, while St Kilda played two home games. The games drew an average crowd of 17,108, with a record attendance of 20,971 for the match between Hawthorn and Richmond.\n\nControversy occurred at York Park when, in a game between St Kilda and Fremantle, the final siren was too quiet to be heard by any of the umpires; play was restarted in error, and in the subsequent confusion St Kilda levelled the scores. After a protest, the AFL Commission convened and overturned the result, awarding Fremantle the victory. The stadium's sirens have since been replaced, and the old ones will be put on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery.\n\nIn 2007 York Park benefitted from a five-year, $16.4 million sponsorship of Hawthorn by the state government. Under the sponsorship agreement the stadium is the venue for five of Hawthorn's matches each year—one pre-season and four premiership games. Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett has expressed interest in his club playing higher profile teams, such as Collingwood, at the stadium.\n\nAs well as being an AFL venue, York Park is the long-term base of North Launceston, and thus hosts regular Tasmanian State League matches. The ground also hosted occasional Tasmanian Devils Football Club home games in the Victorian Football League, from 2001 until the club's demise in 2008.\n\nYork Park hosted its first international sporting fixture in the group phase of the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup, when Romania and Namibia played in front of 15,457 spectators. As a soccer venue the stadium has hosted one National Soccer League match and three A-League pre-season games. Melbourne Knights and Perth Glory played a national league match at the stadium during the 2001–02 NSL season. In July 2006, after the A-League replaced the NSL, the stadium hosted Tasmania's first A-League match when Melbourne Victory and Adelaide United played in the pre-season competition. In 2007, 8,061 attended the corresponding match, which has since become a regular fixture. In addition to pre-season matches, Aurora Stadium has also hosted regular season A-League matches: on 1 February 2012, Melbourne Victory played Gold Coast United FC in a regular season A-League game in front of a crowd of 5,268 people and on 12 January 2013, Melbourne Victory played against Central Coast Mariners in front of a crowd of 6,238 people. Inveresk Precinct Authority chairman Robin McKendrick has stated that ground authorities are attempting to win hosting rights for Australian national soccer team matches. On 30 December 2017, the ground played host to its first ever Big Bash League match when the Hobart Hurricanes took a home game to York Park with the Sydney Thunder being their opponents. The Thunder won by 57 runs in front of 16,734 fans.\n\nAmong non-sporting events, before its redevelopment the stadium hosted an Ike & Tina Turner concert and a Billy Graham religious revival meeting. The Crusty Demons performed at the stadium during 2006 and March 2008.\nElton John performed at York Park during his Rocket Man Solo Tour at the end of 2007; this remains his only appearance in Tasmania as of August 2009.\n\nYork Park is an oval-shaped grassed arena surrounded by several different stands, the largest being the two-tier Gunns Stand on the ground's western side. The stand originally had a capacity of 2,500, which was increased by an extension in 2005 to 5,700.\nThe stand has two corporate box areas, the Gunns Function Centre and the Corporate Function Centre.\nImmediately north of the Stand is the Aurora Function Centre, which also houses coaches' boxes,\nand is next to the heritage listed Northern Stand connecting the Northern, Southern and Eastern Terraces. The stands have a collective capacity of 6,000, bringing the ground's total seating to 11,700.\nThe Railway Workers Hill is a small, uncovered stand located at the eastern side of the ground between the Northern and Eastern Terraces. The ground has a parking capacity of approximately 2,500, from the use of large grassy areas at the adjacent Inveresk site, with an option of street parking.\n\nYork Park has often been criticised for its large playing surface, which is blamed for producing unattractive low-scoring football. Prior to the start of 2009, only 11 of 28 matches saw a score beyond 100 points. For a pre-season match in 2009, 13 metres of width was removed from the outer wing \"in a bid to produce more attractive games.\" Before the match, Groenewegen said, \"Because that outer wing was so wide, once they [a team] chipped wide out there it was very easy for teams to flood back because you were so far away from the goals.\" The ground is also known for its strong wind, which hinders the accuracy of long-distance kicks that are propelled high into the air.\n\nA grant of $50,000 from the Tasmanian Community Fund in 2005 helped the Launceston City Council and AFL Tasmania construct a permanent Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame at York Park. The ground was chosen as the site because it is regarded as the home of Australian rules football in Tasmania. AFL Tasmania initiated the Hall of Fame nomination process, and since 2005 various clubs, players and grounds have been inducted. The Hall of Fame opened to the public on 21 February 2009. As of May 2009, $23.6 million had been spent re-developing the stadium.\n\nThe ground's record attendance is 20,971, at an AFL match between Hawthorn and Richmond on 18 June 2006. This match occurred before the Northern Stand was damaged and the stadium's capacity reduced. An AFL match between Hawthorn and St Kilda on 8 August 2009 saw a capacity crowd of 20,011, the largest crowd since the fire. The stadium's lowest AFL attendance is 9,007 for the match between Hawthorn and on 23 June 2018.\n\nThe highest recorded attendance for an interstate match at York Park is 15,000 for the 1960 clash between Tasmania and Victoria.\n\nThe highest recorded attendance for a Tasmanian Football League match at York Park is 6,755 for the 1989 Second Semi Final played between North Launceston and North Hobart on 2 September 1989.\n\nThe highest recorded attendance for a soccer match is 8,061, when Melbourne Victory played Adelaide United on 16 July during a 2007 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup match. The Billy Graham religious revival meeting on 17 March 1959 attracted 17,000 attendees, a record for a non-sporting event at the ground.\n\nTop 10 sports attendance records\n\n"}
