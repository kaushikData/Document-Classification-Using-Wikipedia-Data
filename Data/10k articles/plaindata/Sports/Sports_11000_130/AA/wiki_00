It took place over the British winter of 1911–12 and this time, to help promote the game of Rugby league in New Zealand, the Northern Rugby Football Union invited a combined Australian and New Zealand team. They became the first tourists to win the Ashes. and the last to do so on British soil for over half a century. The tour was a success in performance and organisation. Matches were well attended, the squad's touring payments were maintained throughout and the players all shared in a bonus at the tour's end.\n\nPrior to the tour a three-way series of matches between New South Wales, Queensland and New Zealand was organised as a basis of selection for the tour. The New South Welshmen dominated the touring side, with four New Zealanders and only one Queenslander selected. However counted amongst the New South Welshmen was Con Sullivan, who had moved to Australia from New Zealand a few years before. Due to family and business commitments, rugby league great Dally Messenger declined to tour with the 1911–12 Kangaroos. His friend and team-mate Sandy Pearce also chose not to go. Chris McKivat who had captained the 1908 Wallabies to Olympic Gold was at age 32 a natural selection as tour captain. The Heads/Middleton reference describes McKivat as being revered on that tour – a magnificent general, tough, durable and an inspiration to the men around him. It quotes Johnny Quinlan the tour co-manager \"He always set a splendid example in conduct and training – a natural leader\" Tour vice-captain was Paddy McCue. Tour managers were Charles H Ford and John Quinlan. The team sailed to England on the \"RMS Orvieto\". The tourists were paid £4/5/ per week and received a bonus of £178 each.\n\nAll eight teams of the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership were represented in the touring squad.\n\nThe New Zealand players that accompanied the Australians on tour have been listed in the Australian Rugby League's Kangaroos players register.\n\nRobert \"Harold\" Nicholson of Queensland was also selected for the tour but withdrew.\n\nPlayed: 35\nWon: 28 Drew: 2 Lost: 5\nAshes: Australia 2–0\nTest No. 12\n\nIn this match, Australia's Charles Fraser became Australia's youngest Test player at 18 years and 301 days, a record which would stand until 2007.\nTest No. 13\n\nMcKivat lead the way for Australia dominating the rucks and scoring a vital try. Renowned Australian journalist Claude Corbett was acting as one of the touch judges and referee Renton, over-ruled his goal decision on one of the Australian conversion attempts.\nTest No. 14\n\nGreat Britain only needed to win the third Test to tie the series and keep the Ashes but were reduced to 12 men early in the encounter after an injury to Dick Ramsdale. Great Britain led 8–0 early but had no answer to the Australian attack as they ran in nine tries.\n\nThis would be the first (and final) time the Kangaroos would win The Ashes on British soil until the 1963–64 Kangaroo tour.\n"}

Axe throwing is an event in most lumberjack competitions. Today there are commercial locations in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom where participants can compete, similar to dart throwing, as well as opportunities at festivals and some theme parks. \n\nThe target is thirty-six inches wide, consisting of five rings that are each four inches wide. The outside ring is worth one point, the next one in is worth two, then three, then four and finally the bulls eye is worth five points. The distance of the throwing line to the target should be 6.1 meters or 21 feet, but at least one association conducts competitions from 15 and 30 foot distances. The axe is scored for the value of the outer most ring that it is touching. Each player gets five throws in a game for a maximum score of 25. The thrower must not step over the throwing line before the axe hits or misses the target; a thrower who steps over the line gets 0 points. Before the competition, a special target for practice throws must be made available. Throwers practicing on the competition target will be disqualified from the competition.\n\nThe sport of axe throwing deals with a potentially dangerous weapon, so the throwing area must be kept safe at all times. If there is an open area behind the target, then spectators and others should be plainly prevented from walking into said area. The target area should be taped off using flags or light fencing materials. A first aid kit and a person trained in first aid and CPR should be at hand in the event of an emergency. For competition in rural and remote areas, the GPS location for the event should be reported in the case of First-Responders being needed.\n\nThe World Axe Throwing League (WATL) is the largest professional association for axe throwing in the world, and the global governing body & league for the sport of axe throwing. With 41 members in 9 countries, WATL is responsible for the organization of axe throwing’s major international tournaments, notably the World Axe Throwing Championship.\n\nThe National Axe Throwing Federation (NATF) is an organization with global membership that seeks to establish standardized rules for the sport of axe throwing. Throwers in NATF sanctioned leagues compete in the National Axe Throwing Championship to award an annual winner of the Wilson Cup. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "44883680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44883680", "title": "Cross-country skiing trail", "text": "Cross-country skiing trail\n\nA cross-country skiing trail or loipe is a route that has been laid out, constructed and maintained specifically for cross-country skiing. Trails may extend point-to-point, but are more typically loops for recreational use or for competition. Until the mid-20th Century, trails were tracked by the passage of skiers. More recently, snow groomers set tracks for classic skiing and smooth lanes for skate skiing.\n\nCross-country ski venues often comprise a system of trails or \"loipes\" of varying length and difficulty that loop back to a starting point. Often trails branch out from a common segment; the more challenging ones then branch off on longer legs. The length of each loop, including segments that coincide with other loops, is typically counted separately. Consequently, the total length of loops is greater than the total length of trail structure.\nIn some regions, skiers may travel between cross-country ski resorts, which are linked by point-to-point trails; these include:\n\nTrail use fees are common at commercial ski venues and may also be found in jurisdictions where skiing occurs on public land; usually there are day, week and annual passes. Venues charging fees may also offer use of heated facilities with a lounge, waxing room, and toilets.\nIn jurisdictions where trail maintenance and grooming has traditionally been funded through taxes, transitions to a user-fee-based system, initiated by increasingly budget-constrained governments, have been met with opposition from those who advocate for the users of \"loipes\", as occurred in East Saxony where an automated kiosk system for trail passes was proposed for 2007.\n\nAn example of guidance for cross-country ski trail construction comes from Northern Arizona University, which cites the manual, \"Recreational Trail Design and Construction,\" developed by the Minnesota Extension Service of the University of Minnesota It emphasizes the following aspects of recreational cross-country trail layout and construction: \n\nThe signage for trails or \"loipes\" may be governed by standards or practices. In North America, they follow the practice of the Cross-Country Ski Areas Association. German ski trail signage conforms to DIN standards, which establish coding for the difficulty of the routes and other norms for \"Loipen\".:\n\nIn its \"Cross-country homologation manual,\" the FIS recognizes that fans of the sport wish to follow it on television. With this in mind, the manual addresses how to design the race course in a manner that not only enhances the experience of spectators, but of viewers, as well—not just to show the athletes in action, but to show the ways in which fans enjoy the action. The manual describes considerations regarding race courses, including:\n\nIn its manual, the FIS requires that courses be designed for the following race formats; Interval start, mass start, sprint and team sprint, relay and skiathlon; each has distance requirements and width requirements, which pertain primarily to up hills; each also has requirements for the number and types of climbs. The FIS requires that competition venues consist of two separate courses to accommodate the classic and skating components of the skiathlon competition, each 5 km long with cut-offs that create finer course length adjustment. The two combine to be a single 10 km course.\n\nA course is expected to test the skier's technical and physical abilities, to be laid out in a manner that takes advantage of the natural terrain, and to provide smooth transitions among uphills, downhills and \"undulating\" terrain (distributed approximately evenly among the three). The manual advocates that courses present a variety of uphills, varying in lengths and gradients between 6% and 12%, and which are arrayed efficiently within the venue. Terms include: definitions of climbs—major (9-18% for more than 30 m), short (9-18% for 10 to 29 m) and steep (greater than 18% for less than 10 m)—and definitions for maximum climb, total climb and for various differences in height, along the way. Course widths vary among 3, 6, 9 and 12 m, depending on the event.\n\nUntil well into the 20th century and the advent of mechanized trail grooming, cross-country tracks were always made by the first skiers to pass through undisturbed, fresh snow and leave a parallel set of ski tracks behind them. Certain local and regional trails are available where the passage of skiers is the sole source of tracks.\n\nThe \"USSA Cross-Country Technical Handbook\" provides guidance on equipment and techniques used in modern mechanized snow grooming operations. A snowmobile or a snow groomer may be equipped with attachments to groom smooth lanes for skate skiing and for setting classic tracks. Techniques and tools used depend on the condition of the snow, which may range between freshly fallen to congealed and icy.\nSnow conditions define the tools and techniques needed for grooming. The \"Cross Country Canada officials manual\" explains snow conditions, starting with fundamentals of heat gain and loss In the snow layer, which include:\nThese factors contribute to the metamorphism of snow, i.e. the process of reshaping snow crystals into smaller, more rounded ice grains, which in turn consolidates and settles the snow pack. Increased density increases strength by joining of grains though sintering and freezing of melted water. New-fallen snow may have a density of 150 - 200 kg/m. Whereas a snowmobile can pack snow to a density of 300 - 350 kg/m, the densities required for recreational trails are 450 kg/m and for racing, 500 kg/m or higher.\n\nAs described in the \"Cross Country Canada officials manual,\" basic grooming involves six processes, as follows:\n\nAccording to the \"Cross Country Canada officials manual,\" FIS Rule 315.3.2 (ICR 2004) requires the following: “The ski tracks must be prepared so that ski control and gliding are possible without a lateral braking effect by any parts of the bindings. The two tracks should be set 17-30 cm. apart, measured from the middle of each track. The depth of the track should be 2-5 cm, even in hard or frozen snow.” FIS Rule 315.3.1 (ICR 2004) requires that for classic technique events a single track should \"be set along the ideal skiing line of the competition course,\" which is normally through the middle of the trail, except for those curves that are too sharp, where the track should disappear.\n\nAccording to the same manual, FIS rule 315.4.1 (ICR 2004) reads: \"For interval start competitions in free technique the course must be well-packed for a width of at least 4\nmeters.\" Tracks are no longer current practice for free-style races, where the skating technique prevails.\n"}

It was located on Firs Street, 0.3 miles north-east of the town centre. At the time of closing the ground had a capacity of 1,800 with 200 seated.\n\nEast Stirlingshire F.C. was formed in 1880 when a group of friends from a cricket team called \"Bainsford Blue Bonnets\" formed a football team under the name \"Britannia\". At the end of the club's first year of existence it found a home at Randyford Park in the east of Falkirk. At the time, the ground's previous tenant was a cricket team called \"East Stirlingshire Cricket Club\" and in 1881, Britannia also adopted the East Stirlingshire name, which stands to this day. By the time the club was admitted to the Scottish Football League in 1900, the club was playing some home games at Merchiston Park in Bainsford and from 1907 onwards it became permanent. The club's first ever league game at Merchiston Park was a 3–2 defeat to Airdrieonians in August 1900 in front of a crowd of 2,500.\n\nIn 1920, the club was forced to move from Bainsford when a railway line was built across Merchiston Park. The club set about looking for a new site to play its home games and a derelict factory site on Firs Street in Falkirk was chosen. The site was named \"Firs Park\" after the street in which it was located and was officially opened in 1921 and would be the club's home for the next 87 years. The first ever opposition at Firs Park was Heart of Midlothian F.C..\n\nShortly after opening, the club's record attendance was set on 21 February 1921 in a Scottish Cup third round tie against eventual champions Partick Thistle F.C., when 12,000 people watched the match. This remained the record attendance for the club during its entire tenure at Firs Park as crowds became smaller due to crowd regulation. In 2007, a limit of 750 was set by police during a Challenge Cup tie with Greenock Morton F.C.. This was due to the small number of turnstiles and there only being one main exit gate.\n\nIn 1964, the board of directors at the club controversially merged East Stirlingshire and junior club Clydebank Juniors F.C. to create \"East Stirlingshire Clydebank\". As a result, the new club relocated to Kilbowie Park in Clydebank and Firs Park was closed. However, the fans won a legal challenge against the move and the club returned to Firs Park and E.S. Clydebank was disbanded. East Stirlingshire F.C. was reformed in 1965. In the meantime, however, the merged club had taken the enclosure roof and floodlights from Firs Park.\n\nApart from replacing the roof and floodlights, there were few changes to Firs Park until it closed. The Main Stand was replaced in 1992, with the club opting for a near replica of the previous stand. At closure, the stadium had a seating capacity of 200 with room for a further 1,600 standees.\n\nDue to the prohibitive costs of improving facilities to meet regulations set by the Scottish Football Association, the club decided to leave Firs Park at the end of the 2007–08 season. The last ever league game to be played at Firs Park was a 3–1 victory for the Shire against Montrose F.C., which meant the club avoided finishing bottom of the Scottish Football League for a sixth consecutive season.\n\nEast Stirlingshire did subsequently play one last game at Firs Park, a \"closed doors\" pre-season friendly vs St Johnstone on Tuesday 15 July 2008, losing 1-3.\n\nThe club groundshared with neighbours Stenhousemuir at their Ochilview Park home. The move was originally intended be for a period of five years during which the club planned to develop a new venue in Falkirk. After lying unused and derelict for almost four years, Firs Park was demolished in January 2012.\nIn March 2018, it was announced The Shire had secured a groundshare at Falkirk Stadium. The first game in their new home was on 5th July 2018; a 3-1 pre-season friendly win over Frickley Athletic.\n\nGreyhound racing took place from 29 October 1930 until 13 May 1933. The racing was independent (unlicensed) and ended due to the fact that two other circuits opened at nearby Diamond Stadium (Brockville Greyhound Racecourse) and Brockville Park.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "264995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264995", "title": "Flying Finn", "text": "Flying Finn\n\n\"The Flying Finn\" () is a nickname given to several Finnish athletes who were noted for their speed. Originally, it was given to several Finnish middle and long-distance runners. The term was later extended to notable Finnish racing sportsmen.\n\nThe nickname was first used of Hannes Kolehmainen, also known as \"Smiling Hannes\", as he took home three gold medals and broke two world records during the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. As Finnish runners started to dominate long-distance running, the nickname was passed on to all successful Finns in the sport, including multi-Olympic gold medalists Paavo Nurmi and Ville Ritola. Nurmi won three gold medals at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Belgium and five at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, where he was partnered with Ritola, who ran to four gold medals. Volmari Iso-Hollo, the winner of 3000 m steeplechase at the 1932 and 1936 Summer Olympics, was one of the best-known Finnish runners in the 1930s and also nicknamed the Flying Finn. During his tour of the United States in 1940, Taisto Mäki—who held five world records—was regularly referred to as a Flying Finn. The last Flying Finn in running was Lasse Virén, who won the 5000 m and 10,000 m events at the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe nickname was next used to describe the efforts of Finnish rally drivers in the 1960s. Timo Mäkinen, Rauno Aaltonen and Simo Lampinen were among the first drivers referenced as the Flying Finn. In 1968, Castrol released a film called \"The Flying Finns\", it featured the 1968 1000 Lakes Rally and concentrated on documenting the duel between Mäkinen and Hannu Mikkola. The term then moved on to the next generations of Finnish rally drivers, and among others, the four-time World Rally Champions Juha Kankkunen and Tommi Mäkinen were often referred to as Flying Finns.\n\nThe first driver to carry the nickname in Formula One was Leo Kinnunen. Kinnunen had the title written on his helmet in 1970, when he won the World Sportscar Championship for Porsche. However, he wasn't able to turn his success in sports car racing into a successful F1 career in his underpowered Surtees. In the 1980s the moniker was given to Keke Rosberg, who became the first well-known Finn in the sport, winning the 1982 world championship. Following the success of later Finnish drivers, Rosberg has been described as the \"original Flying Finn\".\n\nAfter Rosberg, many Finnish Formula 1 drivers have also been called the \"Flying Finn\", including Mika Häkkinen, who won the drivers' championship in 1998 and 1999, Mika Salo, Kimi Räikkönen, who was drivers' champion in 2007, Heikki Kovalainen, and Valtteri Bottas.\n\nOn two wheels, the most famous Flying Finn was Jarno Saarinen, also known as \"The Baron\", who won the 250cc road racing World Championship as privateer in 1972, and finished a close second to Giacomo Agostini in the 350cc class. Saarinen died the following year, while leading both the 250cc and 500cc championships and after competing for only three years. He remains in motorcycle sport history books for developing a new riding style, which is still predominantly in use today; body hanging off the bike with knee near the ground. During the 1970s, Finnish rider Heikki Mikkola won four motocross world championships and also became known as the \"Flying Finn\". Mika Kallio, who finished second in the 125cc championship in 2005 and 2006, has also been nicknamed the Flying Finn. Mauno Hermunen, who has finished third in 2010 and fourth in 2011 in the world supermoto series, has also been nicknamed the Flying Finn.\n\nShefki Kuqi, who played for Scottish side Hibernian F.C. has also been nicknamed the \"Flying Finn\", owing to a strange but popular celebration when he scores a goal. His habit of throwing himself onto the ground, with his arms outstretched and landing on his chest, has drawn notice from many fans and media pundits.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The system is named after John McEnroe, who was infamous for contesting umpire calls. CBS was the first network to use the MacCam widely, as John McEnroe was one of their tennis analysts.\n\nThe MacCam was used at the 2004 U.S. Open to demonstrate several poor calls by chair umpires. In Serena Williams' controversial quarterfinal loss to Jennifer Capriati, several poor calls were contested by Williams. Television replays demonstrated that there were actually several crucial calls that were obviously erroneous. Following this match, the chair umpire Mariana Alves did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this however was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate. A major limitation of the MacCAM was that it could only evaluate the baseline—not sidelines or service line calls. It was ultimately supplanted by Hawk-Eye and similar technologies.\n\nThe MacCAM system has since been replaced at the US Open as well as other supporting tournaments with the ShotSpot system. In the US Open it was available only where the venue has necessary equipment (Arthur Ashe stadium).\n\n"}

The film tells the story of German boxing icon Max Schmeling. It was released abroad under the title \"Max Schmeling: Fist of the Reich.\"\n\nA German paratrooper is seen being injured and receiving treatment in Crete during the 1941 German invasion of the island during World War II. He is then detailed to escort a British prisoner of war who recognises him as the famous heavyweight boxer Max Schmeling and asks him to tell his story.\n\nSchmeling's boxing matches in the 1930s are then portrayed along with his marriage to the Czech actress Anny Ondra (Susanne Wuest) who dislikes boxing, against a backdrop of the Nazis taking control in Germany. Schmeling has no sympathy for the Nazi ideology and is seen to be protective of his Jewish manager Joe Jacobs (Vladimir Weigl). In 1936, a fight in New York City with the formidable Joe Louis (Yoan Pablo Hernández) is arranged despite the opposition of the Nazi head of sport who fears he might lose, because Adolf Hitler wants it to go ahead. Schmeling trains hard and studies film of Louis in preparation for the fight which he wins following a knockout in the 12th round. He returns home a hero but when he takes on Louis again in 1938, he is knocked out after 124 seconds. He returns home and helps some victims of Kristallnacht and when war breaks out in 1939, he obeys an instruction to enlist in the paratroops rather than fleeing abroad.\n\nThe story returns to Crete where Schmeling allows the British prisoner to escape. Back in Germany in 1945, with the German Army on the brink of defeat, he returns to his wife. They abandon their country estate to the advancing Soviets and settle in Hamburg, West Germany. In 1947, Schmeling briefly returns to boxing after failing to find other work before retiring from the sport for good in 1948.\n\nThere was criticism of the acting performance of Henry Maske as the title character, director Boll having selected a real life boxer rather than an actor to play the lead. The plot was also criticized for being \"cliche-laden.\"\n\n\n"}

A race track also may feature grandstands or concourses. Racetracks are also used in the study of animal locomotion. Some motorsport tracks are called speedways.\n\nA racetrack is a permanent facility or building. Racecourse is an alternate term for a horse racing track, found in countries such as the United Kingdom, India, Australia, Hong Kong, and the United Arab Emirates. Race tracks built for bicycles are known as velodromes. Circuit is a common alternate term for racetrack, given the circuit configuration of most race tracks, allowing races to occur over several laps.\n\nA race course, as opposed to a \"racecourse\", is a non-permanent track for sports, particularly road running, water sports, road racing, or rallying. Many sports usually held on racetracks also can occur on temporary tracks, such as the Monaco Grand Prix in Formula One.\n\nThere is some evidence of racetracks being developed in several ancient civilizations. The most developed ancient racetracks were the hippodromes of the Ancient Greeks and the circuses of the Roman Empire. Both of these structures were designed for horse and chariot racing. The stadium of the Circus Maximus in Ancient Rome could hold 200,000 spectators.\n\nRacing facilities existed during the Middle Ages, and there are records of a public racecourse being opened at Newmarket in London in 1174. In 1780 the Earl of Derby created a horse-racing course on his estate at Epsom; the English Derby continues to be held there today. Racecourses in the British Isles are based on grass, known as turf tracks. In the United States, the race tracks are dirt.\nWith the advent of the automobile in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century, racetracks were designed to suit the nature of powered machines. The earliest tracks were modified horse racing courses. Racing automobiles in such facilities began in September 1896, at Narragansett Park in Cranston, Rhode Island. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway was opened in August 1909.\n\nBeginning in the early 1900s, motorcycle races were run on high, banked, wooden race tracks called board tracks. During the 1920s, many of the races on the AAA Championship circuit were run on such board tracks.\nModern racetracks are designed with spectator safety being paramount, following incidents of spectator and track marshals fatalities. These often involve run off areas, barriers, and high fencing.\n\nRacetracks are used for:\n\n\n\n\nSurfaces include:\n\nSome racetracks offer little in the way of permanent infrastructure other than the track; others incorporate spectator facilities such as grandstands, hospitality or facilities for competitors, such as pit lanes and garages, paddocks and stables. Several racetracks are incorporated into larger venues or complexes, incorporating golf courses, museums, hotels, and conference centres. Some racetracks are small enough to be contained indoors, for sports such as motocross, cycling, and athletics.\n\nMany racetracks are multi-use, allowing different types of sport on the same track, or incorporating many tracks in one venue. Commonly running tracks are incorporated within general use or soccer stadiums, either permanently visible or covered by stands or pitches.\n\nMany horse and motorsport tracks are configurable, allowing different routes or sections. Some venues contain smaller tracks inside larger ones, with access tunnels and bridges for spectators. Some racetracks incorporate a short course and a longer course which uses part of the shorter one, usually the main straight, such as Brands Hatch. The Le Mans road race venue is centred on a smaller permanent circuit within its complex.\n\nRace tracks are primarily designed for road racing competition through speed, featuring defined start-finish lines or posts, and sometimes even a series of defined timing points that divide the track into time sectors. Some sports merely measure endurance, or how long a competitor can race. Race tracks can host individual or team sports. Racetracks can feature rolling starts, or fixed starts, with associated equipment (starting blocks, cages, wheel traps etc.) They invariably feature a pit lane, and usually timing equipment.\n\nSome race tracks are of an oval shape, often banked, which allows almost universal spectator views or high speed racing (cycling, stock cars), but are often criticised for lack of excitement; these predominate in North America. A famous one is Nardò where high-speed manufacturer testing often takes place, and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Some oval tracks are variations on an oval shape, for practical reasons or to introduce varying difficulties such as Talladega (a tri-oval). Most race tracks have meandering circuits with many curves, chicanes and changes in height, to allow for a challenge in skill to the competitors, notably motocross and touring car racing - these tend to predominate throughout most of the world, but especially in Europe.\n\nFlatter meandering motorsport courses are sometimes called 'road circuits', originating in the fact that the earliest road racing circuits were simply closed-off public roads. True road circuits are still in use, e.g. the Australian GP has been run in Adelaide and continues to be in Melbourne on regular city streets. The most famous of these are the Monaco GP, and the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium. Some racetracks are specifically configured in a long straight, namely drag racing. Some races will be held only over the straight portion of a track (some horse racing and sprint athletics).\n\nThe boom in motorsport flared after WW2, when many airfields particularly in Great Britain were left without further use. The most famous British track - Silverstone - is one after being a WW2 Class A Airfield, as are Castle Combe and Goodwood Circuit's. The long runways were perfect for drag strips such as at Santa Pod Raceway, and circuit layout usually creatively combined parts of the runways and the surrounding perimeter taxiway. This type of track also appears on the popular motoring show \"Top Gear\", which is filmed at Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, England.\n\nIn 2015, Maurice Hamilton published \"Grand Prix Circuits: Maps and statistics from every Formula One track\", which covered over 70 Grand Prix racing circuits. It provided maps, pictures and a brief history of each track. Each course map is accompanied statistics including circuit lengths, lap records and even the names of corners and straights.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14638937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14638937", "title": "Roller rink", "text": "Roller rink\n\nA roller rink is a hard surface usually consisting of Hardwood, Rollerboard or Concrete used for roller skating or inline skating. This includes roller hockey, speed skating, roller derby, and individual recreational skating. Roller rinks can be located in an indoor or outdoor facility. Most skating center facilities range anywhere from under 14,000 square feet to more than \n21,000 square feet.\n\nMassachusetts businessman James Plimpton's 1863 invention of an improved roller skate led to a boom in popularity in the late 19th century, particularly in cities of the American East Coast. At first, people roller skated at home, but within twenty years businesses dedicated to the activity began to spring up. Plimpton himself is credited with opening the first roller skating rink in New York City. Patrons who enjoyed ice skating during the winter months participated in the similar activity, now year-round. Early roller rinks varied greatly in size and type, both indoor and outdoor. Many consisted of simple wooden platforms that sometimes doubled as dance floors or ballrooms. While primarily an activity of eastern cities, a few enterprising individuals toured the rural areas of the Midwest and South with wagon-loads of roller skates. These entrepreneurs went from town-to-town, often in conjunction with circuses or carnivals, renting out skates and using whatever locally-available surface as an impromptu rink. The post–World War II baby boom also saw a boom in roller rinks across the United States. Having a roller skating birthday party became something of a rite of passage for American children in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Roller rinks in the United States underwent significant changes in the 1970s. New plastics led to improved skate wheels—ones providing a smoother, quieter ride—and easier-to-maintain skate floors.\n\nThe Disco craze from popular 1970s culture led to another increase in the popularity of roller rinks—or roller discos, as some became. Gone were the staid lighting and old-fashioned organ music as a generally older clientele were replaced by adolescents and twenty-somethings skating under mirror balls and special lights to disco beats. The end of the Disco Era and the advent of inline roller skates hit the roller rink industry hard, with many rinks closing. However, as had happened throughout history, most rink owners adapted and survived the economic storm. Roller derby, a professional sport of the 1950s and 1960s once considered virtually dead, has seen a DIY, grassroots rebirth in popularity in the early 21st century with amateur and semi-pro teams forming leagues nationwide. Many rink owners support this activity, along with roller hockey, speed skating, and roller figure skating contests.\n\nAccording to data collected in 2004 a Roller Skating Rink owner can expect a 5% growth rate in their first year of business. Owners must have appropriate permits and licenses from the city in order to open the rink. Owners must also obtain appropriate insurance in order to protect themselves in case of injury. The National Roller Skating Association suggests that a rink be placed in a densely populated commercial area. The cost of opening a rink can vary but the average price to start a rink is usually around $1,000,000.\n\nThe RSA International suggest that the breakdown of income is as follows:\n\n"}

{"id": "197655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197655", "title": "Ski binding", "text": "Ski binding\n\nA ski binding is a device that connects a ski boot to the ski. Generally, it holds the boot firmly to allow the skier to maneuver the ski. However, if certain force limits are exceeded, it releases the boot to minimize skier injury, such as in the case of a fall or impact. There are different types of bindings for different types of skiing.\n\nModern alpine skiing bindings fix the boot at the toe and heel.\n\nIn some bindings, to reduce injury the boot can release in case of a fall. The boot is released by the binding if a certain amount of torque is applied, usually created by the weight of a falling skier. The torque required is adjustable, according to the weight, foot size, and skiing style. A snow brake prevents the ski from moving while it is not attached to a boot.\n\nAlso known as randonee, an alpine touring binding allows the heel to be clipped down to the ski when skiing downhill, but allows it to be released when climbing.\n\nAn alpine touring binding allows the skier to have the heel of the ski boot free and the toe of the ski boot in the binding when using Nordic skiing techniques for ski touring, and to have both the heel and the toe of the ski boot in the binding when using alpine skiing techniques to descend the mountain. Most touring bindings are designed for ski boots falling under one of two ISO specifications: \nThe two setups are mutually incompatible: in the former, the boot lacks sockets to engage ISO 9523 compatible bindings, while the later boot toe and heel-piece dimensions are incompatible with ISO 5355 bindings.\n\nThe cable binding was widely used through the middle of the 20th century. It has the toe section of the boot anchored, and an adjustable cable around the heel secures the boot. While binding designs vary, before 2007 almost all dedicated Telemark models had been designed to fit boots with 75mm \"Nordic Norm\" \"duckbill\" toes.\n\nThe Rottefella binding was developed in 1927 by Bror With. The name means \"rat trap\" in Norwegian. It is also known as the 75 mm, Nordic Norm, or 3-pin. After victories at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, the binding remained the standard for cross-country skiing for the next 60 years. They are no longer as popular as they were but are still for sale. The binding has three small pins that stick up from the binding. The toe of the boot has three holes into which the pins are inserted. The boot is then clamped down by a bail. The binding is asymmetrical, having left and right foot orientations. Prior to the Nordic Norm, cross-country ski bindings had as many as four pins.\n\nRottefella's NNN (New Nordic Norm) has a bar in the toe of the boot hooked into a corresponding latch in the binding. There have been several versions of NNN, and the first NNN version is not compatible with current designs. A stronger BC (Back Country) version also exists.\n\nNIS (Nordic Integrated System), introduced in 2005 by Rossignol, Madshus, Rottefella, and Alpina, is fully compatible with NNN boots and bindings, but is a different way of attaching the bindings to the ski. It features an integrated binding plate on the top of the ski to which the bindings attach, allowing adjustment in the field with a metallic NIS key. The initial design of the plate used a movable insert for position adjustment. NIS skis allow installation of non-NIS bindings. In 2007, Fischer abandoned SNS and entirely switched to NIS. \n\nRottefella Xcelerator bindings provide an increased power transfer from ski boots with a matching Xcelerator pattern sole. Xcelerator SSR bindings include QuickLock mechanism for tool-less position adjustment.\n\nSNS (Salomon Nordic System) looks very similar to NNN, except it has one large ridge and the bar is narrower. Three variants exist:\nPilot boots cannot be used with a Profil binding but Profil boots can be used with Pilot bindings. The original Pilot boots had the front pin 10 mm from the front of the boot (RS10), while the newer Pilot boots have the front pin 17 mm from the front of the boot (RS17). SNS is marketed by Amer Sports under their Salomon and Atomic brands.\n\nThe predecessor was simply called Salomon Nordic System (SNS): \n\nThe Rotefella NNN system was adopted by Fischer and their various brands, making SNS decline in use in North America. In response to the need for NNN compatibility, in 2016 Salomon introduced the Prolink system, although Salomon claims that SNS will still be produced and available. The Prolink binding is somewhat lighter than NNN and mounts directly to the ski using pre-drilled holes, as opposed to a built-in ski-mounted NIS or IFP plate used by NNN . Salomon claims their new system delivers a superior “snow feel” as compared to NNN or even their own SNS system which pairs with thicker soled boots.\n\nIn 2007, Rottefella introduced the New Telemark Norm binding. The system's objective is to provide a freeheel telemark ski binding featuring lateral release, increased lateral rigidity, tunable performance, and free-pivot touring functionality. The boots are unlike other tele boots in that they do not have a 75 mm square toe and require a lip underneath the arch of the boot for the binding to attach. Scarpa sells a version of the boot which is compatible with NTN Tele and Dynafit bindings. Rottefella currently (2015) offers two models of the binding, the Freeride for the lift assisted skier and the Freedom for the tourer. Both models feature a free pivot and one boot standard, NTN. Different spring cartridges can be used to match the binding to the skier's weight and skiing style.\n\nIn 2016, Fischer and Rossignol introduced a new IFP binding plate which allows tool-less adjustment of binding position. The Turnamic binding uses step-in locking for the boot, and the lock closes or opens by turning the lever to the side. \n\nThe IFP Turnamic bindings can be used with all NNN/Prolink boots, but the IFP plate will not accept NIS 1.0 bindings because of the new lock mechanism.\n\nRottefella subsequently introduced continuously adjustable MOVE Switch bindings which can be installed in the IFP (and NIS) plates.\n\nIn 2018, Rottefella and Madshus announced the NIS 2.0 plate with the MOVE bindings which allow continuous on-the-fly adjustment of binding position with the boot locked-in. The NIS 2.0 plate and the MOVE Switch turnable wheel are designed to accept any existing NIS/NNN binding, using either fixed inserts or adjustable sliding inserts. MOVE Electric remote adjustment is being developed for 2019-2020 season. Rottefella also provides MOVE Switch conversion kits for NIS 1.0, IFP, and Prolink skis. \nThe use of continuously adjustable bindings has been approved by the FIS; such adjustment allows the skier to fine-tune ski grip and glide, which is important for classic style racing on skis with waxless \"mohair\" grip-zones. Previous Rottefella NNN bindings required the skier to dismount then apply significant force to a small metal NIS key to unlatch the binding.\n\nIn the early days of skiing, the binding was similar to those used on snowshoes: a leather strap fastened over the toe of the boot.\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n"}
