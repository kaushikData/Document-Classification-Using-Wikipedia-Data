{"id": "55705987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55705987", "title": "Australia–England sports rivalries", "text": "Australia–England sports rivalries\n\nAustralia–England sports rivalries\n\nIt is believed that the initial trigger of the Australia-England sporting rivalry began with an insulting article written in a local British Newspaper in the 19th century. “Nothing of interest comes from Australia except gold and black cricketers,” proclaimed the British Daily Telegraph in 1868 with a mixture of colonial arrogance and paternal intrigue.\n\nAustralia and England have topped the medal tally in every edition of the Commonwealth Games, with the exception of the 1978 Commonwealth Games where home nation Canada came out victorious. As of 2017, Australia has won the most Commonwealth Games gold medals with 852 and England sits second on the table with 669 gold medals.\n\nAssociation football is the national sport in England. The English Premier League is widely considered to be one of the strongest and most popular football competitions in the world. Conversely, Association football in Australia is often referred to as 'soccer' and the domestic A-League competition is considered to be one of the minor professional leagues in the country. Despite the major gulf in interest, the Australian national team is very popular which has seen a rivalry develop with the English national team. The two nations first played each other in 1980, which saw England defeat Australia 2-1 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The two teams played each other another four times in the 1980s and 1990s which resulted in English victories or draws.\n\nAfter 12 years of absence, Australia and England scheduled a friendly match at Upton Park, London on 12 February 2003. The English were strong favourites going into the match as they fielded a near World Cup strength team while Australia failed to even qualify for the previous year's World Cup. Despite entering the clash as the heavy underdogs, Australia pulled off a stunning upset over England with a 3-1 victory.\n\nOn 4 March 2016 it was announced that the Stadium of Light would host England for a friendly against Australia on 27 May 2016 as part of their preparations for Euro 2016. The sold-out match finished in a 2-1 victory for England, with goals from Marcus Rashford (on his international debut), Wayne Rooney and an own goal from Eric Dier.\n\nMany sports analysts consider a Test cricket competition (referred to as The Ashes) to be the most intense form of all sporting rivalries involving the two nations. The competition is officially contested between Australia and England but the three nations of England, Scotland and Wales competed under the English flag up until 1992 when the Scots began to compete independently. Welsh cricket players continue to compete for England with Simon Jones being a recent example of a Welsh player competing for England in the 2005 Ashes series. The first Ashes series was contested in 1884.\n\nFollowing England's home Test defeat in 1882, English journalist Reginald Shirley Brooks wrote a mock obituary for \"The Sporting Times\" that notified the public of English cricket's death and stated \"The body and contents will be cremated and the ashes sent to Australia\". Later that year, during England's 1882-83 tour of Australia, English captain Ivo Bligh declared he would \"recover those ashes\" and received a miniature urn which is believed to contain the ashes of a burnt bail. \n\nBodyline was a tactic developed by the English cricket team for the 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia, specifically to combat the extraordinary batting skill of Australia's Donald Bradman. England's use of a tactic perceived by some as overly aggressive or even unfair ultimately threatened diplomatic relations between the two countries before the situation was calmed. A bodyline delivery was one where the cricket ball was bowled at the body of the batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, to the point of being unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.\n\nThe two nations have also met in other important cricket fixtures that weren't played at the Test level. One recent example being the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 final that England won by 7 wickets.\n\nOne of golf's greatest rivalries played out in the 1990s between Australian Greg Norman and Englishman Nick Faldo.\n\nIn May 2012, it was announced that the upcoming series of The Ultimate Fighter would see UK fighters pitted against Australian fighters in what was labeled \"\", a play on the 130 year-old cricket rivalry between England and Australia called The Ashes. The casting call was for Lightweight and Welterweight fighters who were at least 21 years old and had a minimum of two wins in three professional fights. Australia's Robert Whittaker came out victorious in the Welterweight tournament with a unanimous decision victory over Englishman Brad Scott in the tournament final.\n\nWhittaker would once again stir up the rivalry in July 2017 after capturing the interim UFC Middleweight Championship. In a post-fight interview, he told champion and Englishman Michael Bisping it was \"fate\" that they would be fighting for the championship. Bisping responded by storming the Octagon and telling Whittaker he was “disgusted” with said interim belt. The two are expected to fight for the championship in the near future.\n\nThe two nations have met in the final of the Rugby League World Cup eight times, with Australia winning six of their meetings.\n\nThe Australian and English national rugby union teams first met in 1909 at Blackheath with the Australians coming out victorious 9-3. The win was considered something of a black eye at the time in a sport that epitomised a militaristic public schooled sense of athletic rectitude, and was dismissed as a product of outrageous good fortune in the English press, with the Manchester Guardian saying the Aussies’ “nippiness and grit got them through, but their football… was rarely removed from the commonplace”.\n\nThe Battle of Ballymore between Australia and a majority-English British and Irish Lions in 1989 was described by Mike Teague, who played in it, as “the most violent game of rugby that has ever been played”.\n\nThe two nations met in the final of the 2003 Rugby World Cup and the highly fancied Australians had not lost a World Cup match in eight years leading into the match. Despite having home advantage, Australia would lose the final by three points in extra time as Englishman Jonny Wilkinson nailed a drop goal with 26 seconds remaining to break Australian hearts.\n\nThe two teams, then known as Australasia and the British Isles, played off in the 1907 Davis Cup final. Australia would win the encounter 3-2 and in doing so captured their first ever Davis Cup title. The most recent Davis Cup meeting between the two nations took place at the 2015 Davis Cup semifinals. Great Britain, led by Scot Andy Murray, defeated Australia 3-2 in Glasgow and sealed their first finals appearance in 37 years. The Davis Cup ledger stands at 8-5 in Australia's favour.\n\nOutside of Davis Cup, countrymen of the two nations have competed in many Grand Slam finals with the most recent meeting occurring at the 1997 US Open Men's Final. Australian Patrick Rafter defeated Brit Greg Rusedski 6–3, 6–2, 4–6, 7–5 to capture the 1997 US Open Championship. Another notable meeting between countrymen of the two nations played out in a 2002 Wimbledon semifinal between Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Englishman Tim Henman. Henman, who had reached the Wimbledon semifinals three of the previous four Championships, was considered Britain's best chance to break their 66-year drought at Wimbledon and received enormous coverage leading into the clash with Hewitt. Despite the vocal crowd in attendance, Hewitt defeated Henman and went on to claim the Wimbledon title with a straight sets victory in the final.\n\nThe Barmy Army is a semi-organised group of English cricket fans which arranges touring parties for some of its members to follow the English cricket team on overseas tours. The name is also applied to followers of the team who join in with match day activities in the crowd, but do not necessarily travel as part of an organised tour. The group was given its name by the Australian media during the 1994 - 1995 Test series in Australia, reportedly for the fans' audacity in travelling to Australia in the near-certain knowledge that their team would lose, and the fact that they kept on chanting even when England were losing quite badly.\n\nFanatics officially began in 1997 with the aim of forming an organised, passionate & patriotic support group that would follow Australian Sport at home & around the world.\n"}
{"id": "22495330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22495330", "title": "CQC-6", "text": "CQC-6\n\nThe CQC-6 (Close Quarters Combat — Six) or Viper Six is a handmade tactical folding knife with a tantō blade manufactured by knifemaker Ernest Emerson. Although initially reported as the sixth design in an evolution of fighting knives and the first model in the lineup of Emerson's Specwar Custom Knives, Emerson later revealed that the knife was named for SEAL Team Six. It has a chisel-ground blade of ATS-34 or 154CM stainless steel and a handle made of titanium and linen micarta. The CQC-6 is credited as the knife that popularized the concept of the tactical folding knife.\n\nThe CQC-6 has a 3 5/16\" long blade. The handle is 4 5/8\" long making the knife close to 8 inches in length when opened. The butt-end of the knife tapers to a point and features a hole for tying a lanyard.\n\nThe blade profile of most CQC-6's is a Japanese chisel ground tantō with a single bevel or zero-ground blade sharpened on only one side. Early models have a buffline similar to a hamon found on a Japanese Samurai Sword due to a leather buffing wheel used by Emerson to finish his blades. Unlike the typical Japanese chisel-grind, Emerson's grind is on the left-side of the blade as opposed to the right-side.\n\nThe handle material of the CQC-6 is composed of two titanium liners utilizing a Walker linerlock and a single or double detent as the locking mechanism, although one experimental model exists with a ratchet lock. Titanium bolsters make up the front half of the knife with the back half represented by linen micarta scales. The reasons for using titanium as a linerlock material were due to its memory characteristics and corrosion resistance. The screws in the handle, and pivot are traditional straight-head screws to accommodate easy disassembly in the field with an improvised tool, if needed. Most models feature traction grooves for a more secure grip in a wet environment and a chamfered lockface. Early knives were made with black linen micarta and later models featured a proprietary green color made exclusively for Emerson. A pocket clip held in place by three screws allows the knife to be clipped to a pocket, web-gear, or MOLLE.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, individual Navy SEALs from a West Coast team had been using personally purchased custom fixed-blade knives made by Southern California knifemaker Phill Hartsfield. Hartsfield's knives are hard ground from differentially heat-treated A2 tool steel and are known for their distinctive chisel-ground blades. More accurately, they are zero ground; that is, the edge has no secondary bevel, minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes. Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel-ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives, which Hartsfield granted. When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a folding knife, he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson who manufactured folding knives utilizing the Walker linerlock.\n\nAccording to the SEALs' requirements, the knife had to be corrosion resistant, designed for easy cleaning in the field, durable enough to be used on a daily basis as a tool, and capable as a weapon should the need arise. Emerson's folding chisel-ground \"tantō\" became the sixth model in his Viper series and, while a handful of prototypes were referred to as \"Viper 6\", the model was soon named the \"CQC-6\" (CQC refers to \"close-quarters combat\") and was chosen by the SEALs for use. Writer, David Steele, refers to the CQC-6 as the sixth model after five prototypes as opposed to the next in the evolution of the Viper line of knives. Emerson, himself, says the moniker \"six\" was used because the SEALs in question were members of SEAL Team Six.\n\nOwnership of a CQC6 soon became something of a status symbol among members of various elite military units, including Navy SEALs, Army Special Forces, German GSG 9, and British SAS. Because of this connection to the Special Warfare community, Emerson changed the name of his custom knife line to \"Specwar Knives\", and in 1994 this new designation began appearing in the logo on his line of custom blades. It should be noted that the CQC-6 was not an officially issued item, but rather one that was privately purchased by the troops in question.\n\nRichard Marcinko's \"Rogue Warrior\" novels (\"Red Cell\", \"Green Team\", \"Task Force Blue\", \"Detachment Bravo\", \"SEAL Force Alpha\", \"Violence of Action\" and \"Holy Terror\") prominently feature the CQC-6 as a regularly carried piece of equipment. On page 175 of \"Task Force Blue\", Marcinko remarks that his CQC6 was a \"personal gift from Ernie Emerson, himself\". The popularity of Marcinko's books helped fuel the popularity of the CQC-6 in particular and Tactical Folding Knives in general beyond the realm of Military and Law-enforcement personnel.\n\nWhile each CQC-6 is made by hand by Emerson, there are certain subtle variations between models of different years. The earliest examples feature the Emerson \"half-moon\" logo, which is simply the name \"EMERSON\" arranged in an arc on the blade. This was replaced by the Specwar logo in 1994 which resembles the gunsight on the Stealth aircraft and the moniker \"Emerson Specwar Knives\". The gunsight logo was briefly replaced by Emerson's Diamond logo for a period of 1 year(2004–2005), until the die to cut the logo was broken and Emerson resumed the Specwar log. In 2004, Emerson incorporated his patented \"Wave\" opening device into the profile of the blade.\n\nThe blade finish has almost uniformly been Emerson's trademark satin flats and matte edges. However, some models were made with a Black Tenifer coating. The steel was originally ATS-34 but was replaced by its American equivalent: 154 CM. Emerson has made \"dress\" versions with Damascus steel blades and Titanium blades with a bonded carbide edge.\n\nEmerson has used exotic handle materials such as decorative hardwoods, abalone shell, and mother-of-pearl on these dress variants; these models often feature polished hardware as opposed to the bead blasted bolsters on the tactical models. A few early models featured a titanium backspacer, replaced in later years by a backspacer made of G10 fiberglass. Some early CQC-6's featured cutouts in the micarta handle slabs for a small pair of tweezers as found on the Swiss Army Knife.\n\nAt the 2017 G9 USN Gathering knife show in Las Vegas, Emerson made the debut of the most coveted CQC6 to date, a black CQC6 Flipper.\n\nIn Japan there are strict laws regarding the manufacture and possession of tantō blades. In response to this, Emerson made a small batch of CQC-6's with a more conventional blade-grind for a Cutlery Show in Seki City. These knives featured the grind on the right-side of the blade as opposed to the left.\n\nEmerson makes a 10% scaled-up version of the CQC-6 known as the \"Super Six\" and a 10% scaled-down version retro-named the \"CQC-5\". Like all of Emerson's custom knives there is a 13+ year backlog and no new orders for knives are taken.\n\nIn November 2001, Emerson made a one-of-a-kind CQC-6 and auctioned it at the New York Custom Knife Show for the benefit of children whose parents had been killed on 9/11/2001: 100% of the proceeds went to this charity. This knife featured polished hardware, hand-checkered micarta scales, and an engraved blade reading: \"We shall strike a dagger deep into the heart of such evil\".\n\nIn 1994, the president of Benchmade Knives, Les DeAsis, approached Emerson to manufacture the CQC6 on a larger scale as a factory production model. Preferring to keep the CQC6 as a custom-only knife, Emerson instead licensed a similar design of his, the CQC-7. Even though it did not have the craftsmanship of a handmade piece of cutlery, it satisfied customers with their own version of Emerson's work, at an affordable price and without the five-year wait. Benchmade manufactured automatic versions of the CQC7 such as the BM9700. Currently Pro-Tech Knives of Santa Fe Springs, California manufactures an automatic version of the CQC-7 in collaboration with Emerson.\n\nThe CQC-7 is similar in size and blade profile to the CQC-6 with the main difference being a rear brake at the butt of the handle of the CQC-7 as opposed to the boattail shape of the CQC-6. After the contract with Benchmade expired, Emerson began production of this model in his own factory, Emerson Knives, Inc., in 1999. The production version of the CQC7 is not a handmade knife and features no bolsters or micarta in the handle construction. The handle material on the production model is G-10 fiberglass and the edge of the blade has a secondary bevel. There is a larger and smaller version of this knife known as the \"Super CQC-7\" and \"Mini-CQC-7\", respectively and a version with a drop-point blade as opposed to a tanto. An \"all titanium\" handled version with a framelock was made in 2005 known as the HD-7 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of this model. Emerson makes handmade versions of the CQC-7 with variations similar to the CQC-6 mentioned above.\n\nIn the Russian movie \"12\" a remake of the classic Twelve Angry Men, an \"Emerson CQC7\" is revealed as the potential weapon used by a Chechen teen in the murder of his Russian foster-parents. However, the knife shown in the movie is not a CQC7 or even an Emerson made knife.\n\nIn May 2013, a non-custom factory-made Emerson CQC-7 knife carried by Matt Bissonnette who served as point man on the mission to kill or capture Osama bin Laden was auctioned off for charity, netting over $35,400.\n\n"}
{"id": "2636669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2636669", "title": "Cartwheel (gymnastics)", "text": "Cartwheel (gymnastics)\n\nA cartwheel is a sideways rotary movement of the body. It is performed by bringing the hands to the floor one at a time while the body inverts. The legs travel over the body trunk while one or both hands are on the floor, and then the feet return to the floor one at a time, ending with the performer standing upright. It is performed in a variety of athletic activities, including acro dance and some types of Indian dance, in gymnastics, and in the martial art of capoeira. It is called a \"cartwheel\" because the performer's arms and legs move in a fashion similar to the spokes of a turning (cart) wheel. In classical Indian Karana dance, it is called \"talavilasitam\", and in capoeira is called \"aú\".\n\nTo perform a cartwheel, one moves sideways in a straight line, keeping the back straight; places the hand of the same side on the ground, followed by the other hand; kicks the legs over the body and brings them down as the hands and body come up to a standing position.\n\nA classic cartwheel performed with proper gymnastics form always starts with a lunge: the lead leg (stronger leg) in front and the weaker leg in the back. During the lunge, the gymnast has her arms high in the air and straight, with hips square, facing forward. The gymnast then pushes off the front leg and places her hands side by side on the ground in front of her. As she does this, she kicks her legs up and over her torso and head as her body becomes inverted. During the rotation, the legs stay apart in a large, wide straddle (as far apart as the gymnast can get them). The legs are straight, and the toes and feet are pointed. In United States competitions, the legs must reach at least 90 degrees of motion in a competition in order for the gymnast to receive points. Finally, the gymnast sets her first foot on the ground, followed by the second foot, landing in a lunge with the weaker leg in front and the lead leg in back. The gymnast lands facing the opposite direction from the one she started in, hands and arms straight and high.\n\nCartwheels are commonly performed in artistic gymnastics in the floor exercise and on the balance beam. On the floor, a gymnast may precede a cartwheel with other movements, as in a chasse cartwheel, which begins with side-step \"gallops\". It is a required skill in the USA Gymnastics Level 4 compulsory beam routine.\n\n"}

The match was won by Tunbridge Wells against Littlehampton Town 16-15 after 40 penalty kicks. This was recognised as an FA and European record. In September 2006, the Culverden Stadium was subject to a series of vandalism attacks. The clubhouse was broken into and equipment was stolen.

The conference consisted of mostly American schools, with some British schools, from 11 nations - Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Syria, and the UAE. At its peak, 27 schools were a part of the conference. Occasionally, schools who were not EMAC members were allowed to participate in certain tournaments as affiliates. EMAC ceased to exist as a conference in 2011.\n\nThe schedule of tournaments for the following year were decided around April. Teams from individual schools would typically prepare months in advance before an EMAC tournament, which was usually scheduled over a weekend, so as not to disturb school sessions (however, as most EMAC events would last on average from 3 to 5 days, some days would fall on a normal school day).\n\nParticipating schools took turns hosting the various events, meaning that they were responsible for facilitating the events on their own campuses. They were also responsible for housing the traveling athletes with their own students. Occasionally, some students would stay in hotels if there were not enough student hosts available for housing. Due to the large amount of participating member schools, most schools would host only one tournament each year. In some cases, a school might have hosted two events or even none, depending on the schedule from year to year.\n\nThe activities were held in the mornings and afternoons of the tournament, while evenings were usually kept free for the team members to socialize and experience the host city. The teams were often taken to malls and shopping centers, as well as to visit local or historical landmarks. On many occasions, they were also invited to a school-chaperoned mixer or BBQ organized by the host school.\n\nThe following athletic activities were offered:\n\n\nVarsity teams were for students aged 16 and older, while Junior Varsity teams for participants under the age of 16. Both Track & Field and Swimming, however, also included Under 13 teams as well.\n\nTypically, each sport would have four separate tournaments, with a distinction made between boys and girls teams, as well as between Varsity and Junior Varsity teams. The would result in Varsity Boys, Varsity Girls, JV Boys, and JV Girls teams and tournaments. However, both gender tournaments were usually, but not always, hosted together at each level (e.g. Varsity Girls Basketball and Varsity Boys Basketball would usually be hosted simultaneously by one school). \n\nThe exceptions to this were both the Track & Field and Swimming events.

The term became widespread after a December 28, 1975 NFL playoff game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Minnesota Vikings, when Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach (a Roman Catholic and fan of \"The Godfather Part II\" (1974), whose character Fredo had popularized the phrase) said about his game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Drew Pearson, \"I closed my eyes and said a Hail Mary.\"\n\nThe expression goes back at least to the 1930s, in which decade it was widely used publicly by two former members of Notre Dame's Four Horsemen, Elmer Layden and Jim Crowley. Originally meaning any sort of desperation play, a \"Hail Mary\" gradually came to denote a long, low-probability pass, typically of the \"alley-oop\" variety, attempted at the end of a half when a team is too far from the end zone to execute a more conventional play, implying that it would take divine intervention for the play to succeed. For more than 40 years, use of the term was largely confined to Notre Dame and other Catholic universities.\n\nCrowley often told the story of an October 28, 1922, game between Notre Dame and Georgia Tech in which the Fighting Irish players said Hail Mary prayers together before scoring each of the touchdowns, before winning the game 13–3. According to Crowley, it was one of the team’s linemen, Noble Kizer (a Presbyterian), who suggested praying before the first touchdown, which occurred on a fourth and goal play at the Tech 6-yard line during the second quarter. Quarterback Harry Stuhldreher, another of the Horsemen, threw a quick pass over the middle to Paul Castner for the score. The ritual was repeated before a third and goal play, again at Tech’s six, in the fourth quarter. This time Stuhldreher ran for a touchdown, which sealed the win for Notre Dame. After the game, Kizer exclaimed to Crowley, \"Say, that Hail Mary is the best play we've got.\" Crowley related this story many times in public speeches beginning in the 1930s.\n\nOn November 2, 1935, with 32 seconds left in the so-called \"Game of the Century\" between Ohio State and Notre Dame, Irish halfback Bill Shakespeare found receiver Wayne Millner for a 19-yard, game-winning touchdown. Notre Dame head coach Elmer Layden (who had played in the 1922 Georgia Tech game) afterwards called it a \"Hail Mary\" play.\n\nAn early appearance of the term was in an Associated Press story about the upcoming 1941 Orange Bowl between the Mississippi State Bulldogs and the Georgetown Hoyas. The piece appeared in several newspapers including the December 31, 1940 \"Daytona Beach Morning Journal\" under the headline, \"Orange Bowl: [Georgetown] Hoyas Put Faith in 'Hail Mary' Pass\"). As the article explained, \"A 'hail Mary' pass, in the talk of the Washington eleven, is one that is thrown with a prayer because the odds against completion are big.\"\n\nDuring an NBC broadcast in 1963, Staubach, then a Navy quarterback, described a pass play during his team's victory over Michigan that year as a \"Hail Mary play\". He scrambled to escape a pass rush, nearly getting sacked 20 yards behind the line of scrimmage before completing a desperation pass for a one-yard gain.\n\nArguably the most memorable and replayed Hail Mary pass came on November 23, 1984 in a game now known as \"Hail Flutie\". Boston College was losing to Miami (FL) with six seconds left on the clock when their quarterback Doug Flutie threw a 52-yard touchdown pass to Gerard Phelan, succeeding primarily because Miami's secondary stood on the goal line to keep the receivers in front of them without covering a post route behind them. Miami's defense was based on the assumption that Flutie couldn't throw the ball as far as the end zone, but Flutie hit Phelan in stride against a flatfooted defense a yard deep in the end zone. To commemorate the play, a statue of Flutie in his Hail Mary passing pose was unveiled outside Alumni Stadium at Boston College on November 7, 2008.\n\nOther noteworthy examples include:\n\nThe term \"Hail Mary pass\" has become generalized to refer to any last-ditch effort with little chance of success.\n\nIn basketball, a \"Hail Mary shot\" or \"Hail Mary throw\" is a shot thrown from a place far away from the basket (e.g., behind the half court line). It is typically attempted when there is not enough time left in the period to execute a more traditional play, and (in a case where the team attempting the shot is in the final regulation period or overtime) when they are either tied or behind by no more than three points. In basketball, successful shots at the basket will count as long as the ball is released prior to the expiration of time. A scoring shot that enters the basket after time expires is called a \"buzzer beater\" (in reference to the \"buzzer\" that sounds to signal the end of the period).\n\nThere are similar usages in other fields, such as a \"Hail Mary shot\" in photography where the photographer holds the view finder of an SLR camera far from his eye (so unable to compose the picture), usually high above his head, and takes a shot. This is often used in crowded situations.\n\nIn computer security, a \"Hail Mary attack\" will throw every exploit it has against a system to see whether any of them work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1602647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1602647", "title": "Incomplete pass", "text": "Incomplete pass\n\nAn incomplete pass is a term in American and Canadian football which means that a legal forward pass hits the ground before a player on either team gains possession. For example, if the quarterback throws the ball to one of his wide receivers, and the receiver either does not touch it or tries to catch it unsuccessfully, it is ruled as an incomplete pass. An incomplete pass causes the down to advance by one and the offensive team gains no yards. The game clock is stopped.\n\nIf the receiver catches the ball and has possession of it, then loses control of it for any reason and a player from the other team catches it a fumble is called. In the NFL, both feet must be in bounds and the player must have clear control of the ball and make a football move or have the ability to perform such an act. In other leagues, only one foot must be in bounds with clear possession carrying a lighter burden of proof.\n\nIf a member of the opposing team gains possession of the ball before it hits the ground, it is ruled an interception.\n\nIf the receiver (or a defending player) is touched by a member of the opposing team in a way that prevents him from catching the ball, it is ruled pass interference, resulting in a penalty against the touching player's team. The exception to this rule is if the ball is deemed \"uncatchable\" by the referees, in which case a pass interference penalty is impossible.\n\nOften, whenever defensive players blitz the quarterback, to avoid a sack, the quarterback will do what is known as \"throwing the football away\". This is a deliberate incomplete pass thrown off of the field in order to avoid loss of yardage. The main difference between this and intentional grounding is that the quarterback must leave the \"pocket\" of offensive lineman and throw past the line of scrimmage, so there is no penalty issued. Spiking the ball is also considered to be a legal incomplete pass.\n"}

Established in 1967, the PHPA is one of the oldest players' unions in professional sports and the only minor league Players' Association within a major league sport. Recognized by the US National Labor Relations Board as the certified bargaining unit for all members enrolled in the Association, the main function of the PHPA is to negotiate and protect various player benefits by way of a Collective Bargaining Agreement. These benefits include: health and welfare benefits, training camp allowances, travel and trade relocation expenses, per diem, housing allowances, play-off shares, licensing rights, revenue-sharing, and membership assistance programs.\n\nThe Professional Hockey Player's Association was founded in 1967 in Portland, Oregon, when members of the Portland Buckaroos (of the now defunct Western Hockey League (WHL)) recognized that Canadians playing hockey in the United States who were starting families would send their wives home to Canada to give birth to their babies. Canada's social insurance system would cover the expense for Canadian citizens in Canada, but the teams provided no coverage usable in the U.S. A number of Portland Buckaroos, including Doug Messier, Arlo Goodwin, and teammates, led the group and hired Portland attorney Curt Leichner as their legal counsel to legally form a WHL Players Association to allow WHL players to take advantage of group pension and health care plans, gaining better benefits through strength in numbers.\n\nOver the course of the 1967–68 season, players from the American Hockey League saw the benefit of forming a “benevolent society” of their own and approached their WHL counterparts with the vision of creating one players' association which would represent all professional hockey players outside of the National Hockey League (NHL). On May 20, 1968, WHL and AHL players voted to form the “Professional Hockey Players’ Association\".\n\nAfter the 1973–74 season, former WHL President Max McNab became the fourth President of the Central Hockey League (CHL), a developmental league for professional minor league hockey players, which featured some teams that were affiliates for various NHL clubs. With a number of former WHL executives at the helm of the CHL, players were eager to organize a collective voice and become members of the PHPA. A small group of elected CHL player representatives was invited to the PHPA’s annual meeting of player representatives to discuss the application to the PHPA among player representatives from the WHL and AHL. On May 17, 1974, a motion was passed whereby the CHL players' application for membership into the PHPA was accepted. CHL players were represented by the PHPA until 1984, when the league folded.\n\nThe WHL folded in 1974, citing financial pressures resulting from the WHL’s prime venues being taken by the expansion practices of the NHL and World Hockey Association (WHA). The PHPA remained healthy as it still represented players in two leagues, the AHL and CHL.\n\nIn 1985, players in the former International Hockey League (1945–2001) (IHL) petitioned the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to join the PHPA. IHL owners accepted the PHPA as the recognized bargaining unit for IHL players without the need for a formal NLRB vote.\n\nIn 1991, Larry Landon was asked by the PHPA Executive Committee to succeed Curt Leichner, who was preparing for retirement, as the new Executive Director. Landon assumed the role of Deputy Executive Director until 1993, when he officially assumed control of the PHPA. Landon then moved the PHPA office from Portland, Oregon, to St. Catharines, Ontario.\n\nIn 1994, a group of players from the East Coast Hockey League approached Landon about being represented by the PHPA. At the 1994 PHPA Annual Meeting of Player Representatives, AHL and IHL player representatives unanimously approved the effort to unionize the ECHL, and during the 1994-95 season, PHPA staff initiated efforts to represent ECHL players. Eventually, on March 17, 1995, the NLRB conducted a formal, secret ballot vote among players in each ECHL city. The result was an overwhelming response from the players in favor of unionizing the ECHL, with the first PHPA-ECHL CBA finalized in October 1995.\n\nBy 2000, the AHL had a dramatically different look, as almost half of its twenty teams were new, and attendance had almost doubled since 1994. The IHL meanwhile, suffering from significant contraction and challenges in many of its markets, folded in 2001.\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, players in the Central Hockey League (CHL) approached the PHPA with interest in PHPA representation of CHL players. On April 1, 2008, the NLRB recognized the PHPA as the official bargaining unit for CHL players, after a secret-ballot vote conducted by the NLRB. The league and PHPA reached an inaugural CBA in October 2009, which was retained until the CHL and ECHL consolidated in 2014.\n\nIn 2010, the PHPA relocated its headquarters to Niagara Falls, Ontario.\n\nCurrently, the PHPA represents approximately 1,600 players across 58 teams throughout the AHL and ECHL, which are the premier player development leagues for the NHL.\n\nThe PHPA’s management is led by Executive Director Larry Landon, who heads an Executive Committee of player representatives from the AHL and ECHL. For every five teams in a league, one player representative may be added to the Executive Committee. The Committee assists the Executive Director in providing direction and oversight in dealing with various matter of importance to the Association and its membership, including budgetary matters, player issues, strategic planning, and other business affairs.\n\n"}

On this date, upon request, the Queen granted permission for the venue to be known as Royal Randwick. From this date the venue was officially able to be referred to as 'Royal Randwick'. An extract from a letter from Kenneth Scott (courtier), Deputy Private Secretary to Queen Elizabeth II, to the club reads: \"You do not need me to tell you how much The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh enjoyed their visit to the Royal Randwick Racecourse today. Her Majesty was particularly glad that she was able, on this occasion, to legitimise your traditional title of \"Royal\" and to open a very handsome new Grandstand.\"\n\nThe following is a list of Group races which are contested at Randwick Racecourse.\n\nBesides horseracing, Randwick Racecourse has been used as a venue for many other events including concerts and religious masses.\n\nIn 1970, Pope Paul VI celebrated mass at Randwick as part of his pastoral visit to Australia. The Racecourse was also the site of a mass held by Pope John Paul II in 1995 for the Beatification ceremony of Australia's first potential saint Mary MacKillop. It was also the site of the vigil and final mass of World Youth Day 2008 in July 2008. Racing was stopped for several weeks, due to the alterations needed to hold over 400,000 people. This move had been opposed by the Randwick Trainers Association, which holds lease interests over some areas intended to be used for the event. The dispute was resolved, by the federal government and the state government jointly pledging $40 million as reimbursement to the racing industry. The famous racecourse has also appeared in several films, including \"\".\n\nRandwick Racecourse is also used as an exam venue by the University of New South Wales.\n\nIn addition, the annual Future Music Festival was held at the racecourse from 2006 until it was cancelled in 2015\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth II (QEII) Grandstand is the main grandstand building. Originally constructed in 1969, it was torn down to its bare structure and rebuilt into the current state in 2012 and reopened to the public in 2013. It is 110m in length and 6 storeys high.\n\nThe Official / Members Stand was constructed in 1886 and still remains today although it has been extended and modified multiple times, in 1907, 1914 and 1920.\n\nThe Theatre of the Horse, also known as the \"ToTH\", is an outdoor auditorium for the presentation of thoroughbred racehorses both before and after a race. The ToTH is linked to the track-front via an underground tunnel in which the horses access the track. The ToTH has a capacity of 4,500 and is also used for live music events and functions. The construction of the ToTH was not without controversy, many racegoers have criticised the space for not being located trackside.\n\nThe Saddling Paddock Tote Building, known as the Octagonal bar, is located behind the main grandstand. It was initially constructed in 1917 to house a Totalisator, the fourth in the world to be installed. The building is now used as an event space and a bar on race days.\n\nThe Owners Pavilion is located directly adjacent to the Theatre of the Hose and is a private space for racehorse owners. The pavilion was constructed at the same time as the new QEII Grandstand and ToTH.\n\nThe Paddock Stand replaced the St Ledger Stand and Grandstand and was a two-storey, long, horizontal structure. The stand was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II in February 1992, it was also on this occasion that the Queen certified Randwick as \"Royal\". The Paddock Stand was demolished in 2012 to make way for the new QEII Grandstand.\n\nThe Tea House was a large structure at 50m long, 27m wide and two storeys high and could accommodate 1,000 racegoers. The original Tea house burnt down in 1917 and was immediately reconstructed to the same specifications. The Tea House was demolished in 2012 as part of the upgrades to the current layout.\n\nThe Ladies Stand, also known as the Queens or Royal Stand was constructed in 1910 and remained until 1998.\n\nThe First Grandstand was constructed for the first race meeting at Randwick and was made of American timber. Designed by John Hilly, it was intended to be temporary but stood for 15 years.\n\nThe Second Grandstand, also known as the Paddock Stand, was constructed to replace the initial grandstand constructed on site. It was extended in 1907 and 1914 and remained for more than 100 years to 1988 when it was demolished to make way for the new Paddock Stand.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1249988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1249988", "title": "Sheffield Arena", "text": "Sheffield Arena\n\nFlyDSA Arena (originally known as Sheffield Arena) is an arena located in Sheffield, England. It is situated near Rotherham, Sheffield City Centre, Meadowhall and the Centertainment. \n\nOpened in 1991, it is used for concerts and sporting events, and is also home to the Sheffield Steelers ice hockey club. Attendance for all events at the venue has totaled around 7 million since its opening. It has a maximum capacity of 13,600.\n\nThe arena opened as Sheffield Arena in May 1991 and was renamed Hallam FM Arena in 2002, but returned to its original name from 1 November 2007. On 9 August 2010, Sheffield Arena was officially renamed Motorpoint Arena Sheffield, after the Derby based car sales company invested £1 million to rename the venue. In July 2013, the arena underwent a major renovation and now has a new roof, doors, seats, lighting, catering and toilet facilities. In August 2015 the arena was once again rebranded as Sheffield Arena, however in September 2017 nearby Doncaster Sheffield Airport began sponsoring the arena giving it a rebrand, FlyDSA Arena.\n\nConstructed at a cost of £34 million, it was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 30 May 1991.\n\nThe first concert took place that evening, Paul Simon playing as part of his \"Born at the Right Time\" tour. The arena then took on the role of Gymnastics Hall for the 1991 World Student Games which were held in the city and which prompted the investment in, and development of, both the arena and nearby Don Valley Stadium.\n\nThe arena was the location for the Labour Party's 1992 Sheffield Rally. Attended by over 10,000 party members and the entire shadow cabinet. Held just before that year's general election, which Labour was widely expected to win, the event is often seen as a factor in the party's defeat. While the event was seen as a success to those within the hall, many commentators, and Labour politicians, viewing it as triumphalist in nature. However, it has also been asserted that the event had negligible impact on the outcome, with a fall in the party's support having already occurred.\n\nThe arena also hosts annual events including Disney on Ice which is held every year over November/December. TV shows such as \"The X Factor\", \"Britain's Got Talent\", \"Strictly Come Dancing\" and \"Dancing on Ice\" visit the arena every year as part of their tours.\n\nThe arena is a regular venue for some of the worlds best known Comedians such as Russell Brand, Lee Evans, Jack Whitehall, Eddie Izzard and Peter Kay who in 2011 played the arena for 5 nights running with all shows selling out within hours of going on sale.\n\nThe arena has hosted major special high-profile events, including The International Indian Film Academy Awards, which took place on Saturday, 9 June 2007 and was broadcast live around the world. This included a season hosted by the city of Sheffield and nearby Leeds. Also, in 2009, the arena hosted the annual BBC 1Xtra concert and the 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year. The Sheffield Arena is used regular for sporting events and is the home to the city's Elite Ice Hockey League team, the Sheffield Steelers.\n\nThe arena has hosted major boxing events such as when Joe Calzaghe first won his WBO world title here on 11 October 1997 against former world champion Chris Eubank. On the same bill Sheffield born Naseem Hamed defended his WBO title against Jose Badillo. On 26 November 2005 Ricky Hatton extended his unbeaten record to 40–0, defending his IBF and Ring Magazine Junior Welterweight world titles and winning the WBA belt by 9th-round knockout against Carlos Maussa. Sheffield fighter Clinton Woods also defended his IBF light-heavyweight title against Mexican Julio César González on two occasions, winning on points both times. Kell Brook has had many fights here, his most notable being a fourth-round knockout victory of Vyacheslav Senchenko. The Great Britain men's national basketball team played a test match against Portugal in that arena in preparation for the 2012 Olympics.\n\nThe arena has also hosted the WWE UK Rampage event in 1992 and 1993, as well as Rebellion in 2000.\n\nSince 2007, it has played host to the Premier League Darts.\n\nThe arena's resident sport team is the Sheffield Steelers ice hockey team who play in the Elite Ice Hockey League. The Steelers have recorded crowds of up to 10,000 in the building with extra seating being installed at the venue.\n\nThe arena is owned by Sheffield City Trust, an independent charity, and managed under contract by the US media giant Live Nation UK.\n\n\nThe arena has car parking available for around 2,000 cars. It is also proximate and connected to junction 34 of the M1 motorway.\n\nThe arena is connected to the Sheffield Supertram with a stop next to the arena. The main stop is 'Arena'. Across the road at the Valley Centertainment entertainment complex there is also another tram stop.\n\nFor nearly two decades Sheffield Arena had been the only major concert and sporting venue in the Yorkshire region, this however changed as the city of Leeds has its own arena of comparable size which directly competes with Sheffield Arena. The arena's construction caused controversy because it was partly funded by the government through Yorkshire Forward, a regional development agency, whereas the Sheffield Arena attracted all funding independently with no help from the government. The owners of Sheffield Arena as well as Clive Betts, the MP for Sheffield Attercliffe, expressed opposition over Yorkshire Forward's funding of the First Direct Arena which they claimed would cause considerable economic damage to Sheffield Arena, East Sheffield and Sheffield/South Yorkshire itself, Yorkshire Forward dismissed these claims and stated that the arena would bring economic growth not only to Leeds and West Yorkshire but to the entire region. Fears that the construction of the First Direct Arena would lead to a significant reduction in concerts at Sheffield appear to be well founded with many tours in 2014 not going to Sheffield including Miley Cyrus, Prince, Robbie Williams, The Eagles and Pearl Jam. However fears that the arena would suffer from fewer customers as residents of Leeds will no longer have to travel to Sheffield to attend concerts appear unfounded as attendance at concerts remains high.\n"}
{"id": "14615711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14615711", "title": "Social impact of thong underwear", "text": "Social impact of thong underwear\n\nThe social impact of thong underwear has been covered extensively in the media, ranging from a ban on wearing thongs to thongs for the underaged. The rise of thong usage has been asserted by Christian minister Oneil McQuick to be linked to a rise of sexualization in society, and by Christian writer Philo Thelos to be linked to a rise in a desire to go unclothed.\n\nWhen discussing the trend of wearing thongs, Christian writer Sharon Daugherty comments in her book \"What Guys See That Girls Don't: Or Do They?\" that the fashion industry \"may have changed the mindset of our society\", which was followed by the observation that \"the whole idea of wearing so that no panty line or bumps can show isn't substantiated\" and that \"the thong was created by fashion designers to arouse sexual thoughts\".\n\nMonica Lewinsky gave evidence during the Lewinsky scandal that she was flirting with Bill Clinton in Leon Panetta's office, and that she lifted her jacket to show him the straps of her thong underwear above her pants. Some of the news media in America used thong underwear as a metonym for smut in the Starr Report. According to feminist commentator Carrie Lukas, Lewinsky \"with her thong-snapping seduction, forever changed the image of the D.C. junior staffer from aspiring policy wonk to sexual temptress.\"\n\nMarketing analysts Marian L. Salzman, Ira Matathia and Ann O'Reilly observed in the book \"Buzz: Harness the Power of Influence and Create Demand\" that thong brands are riding on the wide media coverage of thongs to create buzz. Photographer Lauren Greenfield wrote in her book \"Girl Culture\", \"Understanding the dialectic between the extreme and the mainstream – the anorexic and the dieter, the stripper and the teenager who bares her midriff or wears a thong – is essential to understanding contemporary feminine identity.\"\n\nIn 2004, political commentator Cedric Muhammad wrote in essay \"The Thong versus the Veil\", \"We wondered at the end of the day, of the two groups of women most prominently featured on American TV these days, who gains more respect for their intellect and spirit – the Afghan woman who is so totally veiled that you can't even see her eyes or the Black woman in the R&B and Hip-Hop video who dances while wearing a bikini and thong?\"\n\nThe dress code for St. Ambrose Academy, a Roman Catholic middle school and high school in Madison, Wisconsin, specifically addresses swimsuits with \"thong-cut legs\" as inappropriate. At Dixon High School in Dixon, California, the dress code specifies that all undergarments – specifically listing thongs, along with bras and briefs – must be covered. University of Victoria Law School briefly put the school logo on thongs, but quickly pulled them from sale after controversy sprung up.\n\nIn 1999 a Miami University male professor was banned from using the school's recreation center because he refused to stop wearing thong swimwear. The professor challenged the school in court. In 2000 a Salinas High School principal was in the center of a variety of controversies including bans on clothing to the extent that \"thong panties were unofficially banned.\" One student alleged that she was given a dress-code violation note for wearing a thong. This story made national headlines in the United States.\n\nIn 2002, a female high school vice principal in San Diego physically checked up to 100 female students' underwear as they entered the school for a dance, with or without student permission, causing an uproar among students and some parents and eliciting an investigation by the school into the vice principal's conduct. In her defense, the vice principal said the checks were for student safety and not specifically because of the wearing of thongs. In 2003, the head teacher of a British primary school voiced her concern after learning that female students as young as 10 were wearing thong underwear to school. This incident led to a media debate about the appropriateness of thong underwear marketed to young girls.\n\nThe University of California 4-H program specifically forbids \"string, thong or crochet\" swimsuits for women. For men, the dress code specifies \"swim trunks only (no shorts, cut-off pants, or Speedos).\" A similar policy by Virginia FCCLA bans \"skimpy bikini or thong type suits\" for women and specifies \"swim trunks\" for men (\"no speedos\").\n\nIn 2001, Vicky Botwright, then 16th seeded in women's squash circuit and dubbed the \"Lancashire Hot Bot\", was prohibited by the Women's International Squash Players Association (WISPA) from wearing a thong and a sports bra in the British Open Championships.\n\nIn 2004, Alexander Putnam competed in the London Marathon in a green thong and painted as a tropical tree to protest against logging in Congo.\n\nFemale bodybuilders in America are prohibited from wearing thong or T-back swimsuits if contests are being filmed for television, otherwise they are allowed to do so by certain fitness organizations.\n\nIn October 2002, Florida officials banned thongs from Daytona Beach and other public beaches.\n\nThe 2000s saw a rise in the popularity of thongs among younger girls, who have been dubbed \"thong feminists\" by comedian Janeane Garofalo. The trend has been attributed to pop idols like Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez. In 2002 Abercrombie & Fitch released a line of thong underwear targeted for girls ages 10–16, though critics pointed out that children as young as seven could fit one of the thongs. A spokesman for A&F, Hampton Carney, stated that he could list \"at least 100 reasons why a young girl would want thong underwear.\" This controversy spawned a great deal of free publicity for Abercrombie, including a chain letter that received wide circulation. British retailer Argos produced child-size thongs and padded bras for girls as young as nine, eliciting a similar response from the public. Etam, another British retailer, produced sheer tops and thong underwear for girls of similar age. In Japan, photobooks and DVDs of underaged girls in T-back thongs has become popular as \"T-back Junior Idols\", which has come under scorn as a new form of child pornography.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3111610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3111610", "title": "Spirit of Surfing", "text": "Spirit of Surfing\n\n'Spirit of Surfing' is a low-key initiative started in 1995 by longtime surfer, Peter Cuming, surf elders Rob Conneelly, and Nat Young, and surf artist Roscoe Kermode. Spirit of Surfing was established to promote the traditions of free surfing; respect for the ocean, the land, and indigenous and local cultures wherever surfers are and travel; fostering community spirit; and an harmonious relationship with the natural environment. These key messages are shared and encouraged in the water amongst surfers and through other opportunities such as festivals, forums, gatherings and local surfing communities. It was first presented to the Angourie Boardriders in late 1995, at Yamba, in NSW. They adopted the general Spirit of Surfing (SoS) principles in their approach to their activities including a stronger focus on active beach restoration work as part of their regular surfing sessions and competitions. Peter Cuming liaised with Nat Young, past world short and longboard surfing champion, who supported the aims, and raised the concept in his working relationship with the World Longboard Championship Tour to engage in adopting the principles.\n\nThe Surfers Code, or Tribal Law (Lore) as it was initially called, was developed as an SoS project by Rob Conneelly, based on the verbally shared \"Gentlemen's Rules\" of old; seeded by ideas and discussion of the concept between Conneelly and Cuming, liaison with Aboriginal musician-surfer, Merv Graham, surfer Wayne Murphy, and design support from Roscoe Kermode. This resulted in a “Tribal Law” poster which emerged under Roscoe’s skilled hands, and was launched at the Margaret River Surfing Classic in 1996, which also included an “expression session” to promote creative ‘free’ surfing. It was again part of the Margaret River Masters Surf Classic in 1997, and the focus of a project with local community healthcare groups in Margaret River, sponsored by the W.A Health Promotion Foundation, in response to growing surf related injuries, and promoting the necessary safety aspects of surfing along the powerful South-Western Australian coastline. In October 1998, at Margaret River in Western Australia, the group erected a Tribal Law (Tribal Lore) plaque at Surfer's Point, explaining surfers' principles of right-of-way, safety and respect in the water. Follow-up plaques at ‘Lefthanders’ and other well-known nearby breaks in the South West were planned, as well as at Perth surf beaches, and plaques created however didn’t eventuate. To this daythe plaques haven't resurfaced and must truly be valued by those that have them! \n\nHearing of the Surfer’s Code and the Margaret River plaque, a group of surfing interests from the West Coast of Victoria-based around Bells Beach-Winkipop contacted SoS trust members and with Roscoe Kermode’s artistic support, a code was developed for Bells Beach and launched as the Bells Beach Surfers Code in 2000. The Bells Beach Spirit of Surfing committee was formed to further develop projects at Bells Beach. This committee includes the Surf Coast Shire, Torquay Boardriders, Surfers Appreciating the Natural Environment (SANE), Surfing Victoria Inc. Surfrider Foundation, and the Bells Beach Surfing Reserve Advisory Committee. Victorian-based Mornington Peninsular Surfriders, hearing of the surfers code, liaised with the Bells Beach group and arranged distribution of the general surfer’s code poster as a guide for surfers on the East Coast Peninsular.\n\nSoS supported and facilitated the Spirit of Surfing/ Surf Elders Gathering held at Broken Head, Byron Bay, New South Wales, in June 2000, organised by and held at the home of longtime surfer and Greens New South Wales Senator, Ian Cohen. The 2-day weekend gathering of 30 people, facilitated by Peter Cuming, represented around 700 years of personal surfing experience. It included representatives from the Surfrider Foundation, Australian Professional Surfing Association, and surfers from Southern Queensland, Sydney, NSW North Coast and Central Coasts, and Bells Beach/Victorian West Coast regions. Surfing elders such as George Greenough, Nat Young, Dick Hoole and Rusty Miller shared visions and stories. The gathering discussed the growing interest in the sport and lifestyle of surfing, concerns about commercialisation, ‘surf rage’ and the Spirit of Surfing concept. As a result of the gathering the principles and establishment of the Spirit of Surfing Trust was supported. A number of media releases presented the key issues that the Spirit of Surfing concept was tackling and commitments were made to promote the SoS principles.\n\nLater that year, the Surfrider Foundation in NSW, launched a version of the Surfers Code, under the guidance of Neil Lazarow with support from the formative Spirit of Surfing Trust, A ‘Law of the Ocean’ forum, sponsored by Southern Cross University, was also held in Byron Bay in 2001, and discussed a range of issues, implications and responses related to ‘surf rage’ events, including the Surfers Code and Spirit of Surfing concept.\n\nIn 2000 when Nat Young was seriously assaulted in a \"surf rage\" incident at Angourie Point, he gifted $7000 he received as payment from a television interview on the incident to the SoS initiative. These funds were used to support the work of the movement including development of the Bells Beach, Victoria, Spirit of Surfing (SoS) project. Through 2000 to 2002 the Bells Beach SoS working group, supported by SoS consulted with local surfing groups, aboriginal traditional owners and the local council, Surf Coast Shire to design and erect key standing stones reading \"Respect the Ocean\", \"Respect the Land\", \"Respect each Other\", as a local interpretation of the surfing spirit. These stones are seen by all surfers who use the path to the famous Bells Beach break. The project involved locating and installing hand carved sandstone plaques, and a signing ceremony involving some of the first surfers to surf Bells Beach, local Aboriginal custodians, Surf Coast Shire, Bells Beach Surfing Reserve, SoS, Surfrider Foundation, SANE and Torquay boardrider club representatives.\n\nThe Pacifique Boardriders, near Bundaberg, in Central Queensland established an SoS Project at their focus beach at Bargara. Initially established in 1963 the Pacific Boardriders were renewed in the early 2000s with a membership of over 200. The group’s aims and objectives as well as surfing guidelines include the Spirit of Surfing’s principles of safe and free surfing, and respecting the ocean, the land, and each other. A broader Spirit of Surfing project committee was also formed develop a creative signage installation at Bargara, to include representatives from the local indigenous Murri and South Sea islander community, local residents and Chamber of Commerce, and the Burnett River Shire Council.\n\nLynne Hulme from the Surf Coast Shire, Surf Coast Shire Council based at Torquay (and member of the Bells Beach SoS project) contacted SoS Trust to hold a 2nd Spirit of Surfing Gathering at Torquay, in April 2003, just before and as part of the iconic Bells annual surfing contest. Facilitated by Peter Cuming and Elizabeth Bragg, it was attended by over 70 people including surf elders, surfing industry representatives, surfboard designers, shapers, academics and government agencies, surf psychologists and educators, Surf Coast Shire representatives and regional surfers. Workshop proceedings were prepared from the forum which focused on the need to develop a more sustainable surfing industry, including codes of practice and sourcing of materials; educating travelling surfers about impacts on local cultures; encouraging surfers to play a greater role in protecting and regenerating coastal areas, dealing with anger/anger management in the water, and modern surfers developing more sustainable lifestyles.\n\nNat Young has continued to fund the development and erection of Surfers Code signage at a range of locations in Australia, Europe, and the USA (e.g. Rincon). This includes Byron Bay, where Cuming introduced the concept and a representative of the Bells Beach SoS working group to Ben King, president of the Byron Bay Boardriders Club, around 2005. Ben then worked with Nat Young, Byron Shire Council and Cape Byron Trust, to help establish Surfers Code signage at Clark's Beach near well known break The Pass, and at Broken Head.\n\nThe Surfers Code, and articles on its development and importance given increasing numbers of surfers in the water and ongoing commercialisation, have been printed to promote awareness in a wide range of surfing magazines, in Australia and internationally. This includes Tracks, Surfing World, Surfers Path, Surf Session (France), and Wave Surfgirl. A range of books and other publications such as Nat Young’s 'Surf Rage' Nat Young, and 'Surf's Up - The Girl's Guide to Surfing' by Louise Southerden include the Spirit of Surfing and Surfer’s Code principles.\n\nThe SoS has not accepted sponsorship at this stage on the basis that it may dilute or affect the capacity to promote the messages, however encourages industry and business participation in applying the principles. SoS has supported action by and participated in organisations such as the National Surfing Reserves Committee, which has established surfing reserves in key and iconic surfing locations, such as Angourie and Lennox Head, New South Wales.\n\nCuming was a forum panel speaker at the Byron Bay Surf Festival in 2014, on the impact of surfing culture in the developing world including indigenous communities. The forum was facilitated by surfer Lauren Hill, representing the SoS principles related to the influences surfing has, both positive and negative, on existing cultures, and the potential for surfing to support and strengthen the connection people have to their land, local communities, and cultures.\n\nSoS is in the process of developing a website which provides information on the range of SoS and Surfers Code projects, as well as surf elders, well-known surfboard designers, shapers, professional, recreational and free surfers, artists, musicians and activists expressing what the 'spirit of surfing' means to them.\n\n\n"}

At the same time, he proposed the doctrine of \"revolution of the mind\" to encourage students to always renew. Vovinam is based on Vietnamese traditional subjects. \n\nVovinam involves the use of the hands, elbows, legs, knees and weapons such as swords, knives, chisels, claws, fans. Students also learn how to deal with hand-held weapons, counter-attacks, lock-ups, and levers. Amongst Vietnamese martial arts, Vovinam is the largest and most developed in Vietnam with more than 60 schools around the world, including Poland, Belgium, Cambodia, Denmark, Germany, the United States, Morocco, Norway, Russia, France, Romania, Switzerland, Sweden, Singapore, Uzbekistan, Thailand, Italy, Australia, India, Iran, Spain, Algeria, Taiwan. The Chief of Vovinam Council now is Nguyễn Văn Chiếu.\n\nVovinam is practiced with and without weapons. It is based on the \"principle of between hard and soft\". It includes training of the body as well as the mind. It uses force and reaction of the opponent. Vovinam also includes hand, elbow, kicks, escape- and levering techniques. Both attack and defense techniques are trained, as well as forms, combat and traditional wrestling.\nThe wide range of techniques include punching, kicking, forms, wrestling, sword, staff, axe, folding fan and others.\n\nSelf-defense techniques cover defense against weaponless attacks like choking from behind and defense against attackers armed with knifes or swords. Advanced students learn to combine the techniques and defend themselves against armed opponents. Instructors teach traditional weapons like the long stick, short stick, knife, sword and sabre. The weapons thus serve as training devices for reaching optimal control of body and mind.\n\nVovinam Việt Võ Đạo was founded as \"Vovinam\" by Nguyễn Lộc (1912 – 1960) in 1938, with the intent of providing practitioners with an efficient method of self-defense after a short period of study. Nguyễn believed martial arts would contribute to freeing Vietnam, which had been ruled by France since 1859, from outside domination. Vovinam, which Nguyễn synthesized from Chinese styles of kung fu, his own knowledge of traditional Vietnamese martial arts, and elements of Japanese and Korean systems, was thus created partially as a response to the French occupation, meant to promote a sense of national identity for the Vietnamese people. Vovinam thus has anticolonial origins.\n\nAfter being invited to demonstrate Vovinam publicly in Hanoi with his disciples in 1940, Nguyễn was invited to teach the art at Hanoi's Ecole Normale, and Vovinam gained in popularity. During the following years, political unrest increased throughout Vietnam; due to the system's nationalist political orientation, the art came under suppression. By 1954, Nguyễn had emigrated to South Vietnam, where he was able to continue to teach and establish Vovinam schools. After his death in 1960, Grandmaster Le Sang continued the development and international promotion of Vovinam until his own death on September 27, 2010. The first Vovinam school outside of Vietnam was established in Houston, Texas, by Vietnamese emigrants in 1976, after the Fall of Saigon. By 2000, Vovinam schools had been established in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. Vovinam now exists as \"Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo\", without the political overtones it originally carried.\n\nThe Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo logo is framed in a yellow shape composed of a rectangle conjoined with a circle, angular at the top, round at the bottom. This shape symbolizes the perfection of the hard and soft. Within this yellow shape, the red text \"Vovinam\" is written above the marine blue text \"Việt Võ Đạo\". Beneath the text appears a yin-yang symbol in red and marine blue. The yin-yang symbol is surrounded by a thick, white circle, symbolizing the being of the Dao, with the mission to mediate between yin and yang, to subdue the two, to enable life of all beings. A yellow map of Vietnam is superimposed on the yin-yang symbol.\n\nThe yin and yang theory (Vietnamese: \"Âm-Dương\" and \"Nhu-Cương\") states that everything in the universe and on earth is initiated through the interrelation of Âm (negative) and Dương (positive). As to this theory there are martial arts that prefer the hard over the soft and others that prefer the soft over the hard. Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo does not prefer any over the other. Hard and soft are used equally to adapt to every situation, to every problem.\nBased on Võ-Thuật, the student aims to develop the ability to combine hard and soft in combat and in daily life. This aims to develop physical abilities as well as the student's spirit.\nNot only the principle of the harmony of hard and soft but also many other things resulting from the training contribute to internalizing the martial art philosophy, e.g. fighting spirit, courage, tenacity, fairness, modesty and tolerance. Above all the training in morality and the way of applying the techniques shape the students' character. Emphasis is placed on recognizing one's ego and overcoming it.\n\nIn doing so the Vovinam student will gain generosity and tolerance with other people. With the awareness that the most important thing in a human's life are other humans, the final goal is to be able to not only help oneself but also to help others to live in peace and harmony with their surroundings.\n\nWith the salutation \"Iron Hand over benevolent heart\", the student is reminded of the main principle and the goal of Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo with every training. It is also about using the opponent's force and reaction, reaching maximum effect with comparatively little force.\n\nThe term \"Việt Võ Đạo\" (\"the way (Dao) of Viet Vo\") was coined by the patriarch of the second generation of the Vovinam Viet Vo Dao, Le Sang, with the objective of adding a philosophical dimension to his martial art. This \"Viet Vo Dao\" consists of ten principles:\n\n(The wording can vary slightly between Vovinam schools)\n\nA \"Việt Võ Đạo Federation\" was founded on November 3, 1973, in order to reunite some Vietnamese martial arts. Therefore, \"Việt Võ Đạo\", in Europe, is also used as a generic term for certain Vietnamese martial arts and philosophies but in Vietnam is only used to refer to \"Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo\".\n\nFrom 1938 to 1964, there was no official uniform. Following the lifting of the ban on martial arts in Vietnam in 1963, the first Council of Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao was gathered in 1964 to codify Vovinam, establishing a rank hierarchy and uniforms and codifying the training curriculum according to rank. The color blue was adopted as the official color for Vovinam uniforms. A separate development of the \"Việt Võ Đạo Federation\" in 1973 until 1990 the uniforms' color was black.\n\nIn the summer of 1990, Vovinam masters from around the world met at the International Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao Conference in California with the goal of creating a structured organization for Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo outside Vietnam (the International Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao Federation). One of the decisions was that the suit in Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo were now to be blue worldwide.\n\nThe student begins with a cyan belt - the same color as his/her suit.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Blue stands for the factor of the sea, and the hope - the hope in being successful in learning Vovinam.\n\nWith the following 3 exams yellow stripes are added to the blue belt. The 3rd yellow stripe is followed by the yellow belt.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Yellow It symbolically stands for the skin color of Asian people. It symbolizes the \"skin deep\" internalization of the martial art and the philosophy.\nIn other martial arts this belt is black. Therefore, a Vovinam student who carries a yellow belt is allowed to carry a black belt. This makes a comparison to other martial arts easier, e.g. in public performances. A person who wears a yellow belt with one or more stripes is considered an instructor.\n\nFollowing in a longer period of time, respectively 3 red stripes are added to the yellow belt. This corresponds to the 1st, 2nd, respectively 3rd degree blackbelt (Đẳng).\nThe exam following the 3rd red stripe is the master's exam. Passing the exam successfully assigns the right to wear a red belt with a circulating yellow border (4th degree blackbelt). \n<nowiki> </nowiki>Red stands for the blood and the intensive flame. The student has internalized Vovinam (Việt Võ Đạo) even further.\n\nThe 5th to 10th degree blackbelt are shown as a completed red belt with 1 to 6 white stripes.\n<nowiki> </nowiki>White stands for the infiniteness, the bones; is the symbol of the depth of the spirit. The white belt assigns the master the absolute mastery of Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo.\nOn the white belt thin, lengthwise stripes in blue, black, yellow and red symbolize the whole of Vovinam (Việt Võ Đạo) again. This belt is reserved for the \"Chưởng Môn\".\n\nNow, Vovinam has two different sets of belt ranking because of the different training program: The WVVF Vovinam (headquarter: Vietnam) uses the traditional program and (headquarter: France) uses the new training program.\n With every change of belt color the name plate color changes. Blue belt students start off with yellow text on blue name plates. With the yellow belt the name plate changes to red text on yellow ground. The red belt comes along with white text on a red name plate. The patriarch carries red text on a white name plate. Thin, colored lines in blue, yellow and red are shown on the upper and lower borders of this white name plate.\n\nVovinam has some specialised techniques:\n\n\n\n"}
