{"id": "43645096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43645096", "title": "CrossFit Games", "text": "CrossFit Games\n\nThe CrossFit Games is an athletic competition sponsored by Crossfit Inc. and Reebok. The competition has been held every summer since 2007. Athletes at the Games compete in workouts that they learn about hours or days beforehand, consisting mostly of an assortment of standard aerobic, weightlifting, and gymnastics movements, as well as some additional surprise elements that are not part of the typical CrossFit regimen such as obstacle courses, ocean swimming, softball throwing, or ascending a pegboard. The CrossFit Games stylizes their individual winners as the \"Fittest on Earth\".\n\nIn 2007, the first annual CrossFit Games were contested in Aromas, California, on a small ranch owned by the family of Games director Dave Castro. For the initial Games in 2007 and 2008, participation was open to anyone who made it to Aromas. The Games would also award an Affiliate Cup to the group from one CrossFit gym that had the best combined individual standings. In 2009, competitors had to qualify after over a hundred athletes had shown up in 2008. The athletes earned an invitation through either placing high enough in the previous year or through placing in the top worldwide in a set of qualifying events called Regionals hosted at a few CrossFit gyms. The CrossFit Games also added a separate set of team-based events for the Affiliate Cup, marking the first use of a designated Team Division, with teams of four (two men and two women).\n\nInterest and participation in the event continued to grow, and in 2010, the qualification was adjusted to include hosting multiple Sectionals, a series of events open to all athletes in order to qualify for the one of the 17 Regionals. The 17 regions had Canada and the United States divided into 12 regions, with the remaining regions roughly corresponding the five other populated continents. The attendance at the Games also outgrew the ranch in Aromas and moved the Home Depot Center (later called the StubHub Center) in Carson, California. The Games also expanded the Team Division to groups of six athletes and added a Masters Division for individual men and women 55-years-old and up.\n\nIn 2011, the open participation Sectionals were replaced by an online qualification called the Open. In 2011, 26,000 athletes signed up to compete in the Open. In 2012–2018, participation was 69,000, 138,000, 209,000, 273,000, 324,307, 380,000, and 415,000 respectively.\n\nIn 2015, the qualification format changed from 17 regional events to eight. Each \"super-regional\" event included qualifiers from two or three of the previously defined regions, totaling 40 or 50 athletes at each event.\n\nFollowing seven years in Carson, the Games moved to the Alliant Energy Center in Madison, Wisconsin, in 2017. The next year, the qualifying Regionals were once again realigned due to increased competitiveness and popularity outside of Canada and the US. In 2018, there were nine Regionals hosted among 18 redefined regions with Europe increasing to three regions, Central America split from South America, while eliminating the Northern and Southern California regions.\n\nCrossFit, Inc. founder Greg Glassman has stated that the format for the 2019 games will be changed again with the replacement of the typical Regionals for CrossFit-sanctioned international qualifying events. As part of the changes, the 2019 games athletes qualify through being the top individual and team finishers from the sanctioned events, the top athlete from each country in the CrossFit Open, the top 20 overall finishers in the CrossFit Open, and four at-large athletes as chosen by CrossFit, Inc. Teams also no longer need to be created from one CrossFit-affiliated gym and can be formed from any four competitors.\n\nParticipation and sponsorship have grown rapidly since the inception of the Games. The prize money awarded to each first-place male and female increased from $500 at the inaugural Games to $275,000 from 2013 to 2016. The largest jump in prize money came from the first Games sponsored by Reebok in 2011 when first place went from $25,000 in 2010 to $250,000 in 2011. The total prize payout in 2016 was $2,200,000.\n\nAs of the 2019 CrossFit Games, the season consisted of three stages of competition: the Open, sanctioned events, and the Games themselves. This format was changed for the 2019 season, in which the CrossFit, Inc. hosted Regionals were replaced by independently run CrossFit-sanctioned events.\n\nThe Open, introduced in 2011 and so called because participation is open to anyone, is held over five weeks in February–March; a new workout is released on each Thursday night (Pacific Time) and competitors complete the workout and submit their scores online by Monday evening, with either a video or validation by a CrossFit affiliate. Since 2013, Open workout announcements have been broadcast live, and featured two or more past CrossFit Games athletes competing head-to-head immediately following the workout description. Beginning with the 2019 Games, the top athlete from each country and the top 20 overall Open finishers qualify directly to the Games.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2018, competitors would qualify for the Games through participation an the Regionals. For the 2019 Games, CrossFit, Inc. decided to discontinue hosting the Regional qualifier and instead sanctioned previous independent fitness events as qualifiers separate from the Open. These sanctioned events were already widely participated in by CrossFit Games athletes, often used as a part of off-season training, around the world.\n\nAs of November 1, 2018, the sanctioned events for the 2019 CrossFit Games are in chronological order: Dubai CrossFit Championship (Dubai), Wodapalooza (Miami), Australian CrossFit Championship (Broadbeach), CrossFit Fittest in Cape Town, CrossFit Strength in Depth (London), CrossFit French Throwdown (Paris), Asia CrossFit Championship (Shanghai), Mid-Atlantic CrossFit Challenge (Baltimore), CrossFit Italian Showdown (Milan), Brazil CrossFit Championship (São Paulo), CrossFit Lowlands Throwdown (Apeldoorn), Down Under CrossFit Championship (Wollongong), Reykjavik CrossFit Championship (Reykjavik), Rogue Invitational (Columbus, Ohio), and the Granite Games (St. Cloud, Minnesota).\n\nThe top athletes from each sanctioned event, each national champion in the Open, the top twenty overall finishers in the Open, and four at-large invitees advance to the CrossFit Games, which are held over three days in July or August.\n\nThe marquee events at the CrossFit Games are the men's and women's individual competitions. The first place prize for each currently stands at $300,000.\n\nOriginally, teams were awarded the \"Affiliate Cup\" for having the best overall score from the individual athletes that had come from the same CrossFit-affiliated gym. In 2009, the Games began having a separate set of events for affiliate teams and consisted of four to six athletes from the same gym. The next season, the format was finalized to teams of three men and three women. In the 2018 games, each team was changed to four members, two men and two women. In 2019, CrossFit removed the stipulation that team members had to be from the same affiliate. Teams are subject to a similar qualification process as the individuals.\n\nThe Games include age-based divisions for younger and older competitors. Masters divisions were introduced at the 2010 Games. There are currently six divisions each for women and men: 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, and 60+. Divisions for teenagers were introduced in 2015: the age ranges are 14–15 and 16–17, for both boys and girls. Rather than regional events, masters and teen athletes qualify for the games by a second online competition following the Open. The top 200 athletes in each division worldwide are invited to compete in this qualifier, of which the top 20 advance to the Games. Prior to the introduction of these secondary online qualifiers, masters and teens competitors qualified for the Games directly from the Open.\n\nDue to CrossFit's official partnership with Reebok, competitors at the 2015 Games were banned from wearing Nike footwear. Nike arranged for several trucks to be parked near the main entrance to the arena, which served as mobile billboards with the slogan \"Don't ban our shoe, beat our shoe\". The partnership also prohibits Nike from labeling its \"Metcon\" shoes as intended for CrossFit – the brand uses the term \"high intensity training\" instead.\n\nCrossFit's decision to award winners of the 2016 Games with handguns resulted in widespread criticism from members and sponsors. Resulting protests forced the temporary closure of two CrossFit locations in New York City.\n\nIn 2011, ESPN began to broadcast the CrossFit Games, with live coverage streamed through ESPN3, and some television coverage on ESPN2. As the event grew, ESPN expanded its television coverage; in 2014, the network entered into a multi-year deal to continue broadcasting the CrossFit Games, and coverage expanded to nine-and-a-half hours on ESPN and ESPN2 by 2015. In 2017, the event began a new broadcast arrangement with CBS Sports, with television coverage on CBS Sports Network, and a total of 40 hours of digital streaming coverage. CrossFit also streamed coverage through Facebook and their website.\n\nIndividual and Team champions\nMasters men's champions\nMasters women's champions\nTeens champions\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5331593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5331593", "title": "Flying disc games", "text": "Flying disc games\n\nFlying disc games are games played with discs, often called by the trademarked name Frisbees. Ultimate and disc golf are sports with substantial international followings.\n\nThe flying disc was developed in 1948 by Walter Morrison. In 1957 January 13, Wham-O bought the rights to the invention and released it later under the trademarked name Frisbee.\n\nAlthough playing catch with discs as a pastime and proto-golf games are documented from the early 1900s, and doubtlessly has occurred from time to time before, disc sports began to flower in the late 1960s. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a frisbee. What started with a few players, in the sixties, like Victor Malafronte, Z Weyand and Ken Westerfield experimenting with new ways of throwing and catching a disc, later would become known as playing disc freestyle. Organized disc sports, in the 1970s, began with promotional efforts from Wham-O and Irwin Toy (Canada). These took the form of national tournaments and Frisbee show tours at universities, fairs and sporting events. Disc sports such as freestyle, double disc court, guts, ultimate and disc golf became this sports first events. Two sports, the team sport of ultimate and disc golf are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi-professionally. The World Flying Disc Federation, Professional Disc Golf Association, and the Freestyle Players Association, are the official sanctioning organizations for disc sports worldwide.\n\nGuts was invented by the Healy Brothers in the 1950s and developed at the International Frisbee Tournament (IFT) in Marquette, Michigan. Ultimate, the most widely played disc sport, began in the late 1960s with Joel Silver and Jared Kass. In the 1970s it developed as an organized sport with the creation of the Ultimate Players Association with Dan Roddick, Tom Kennedy and Irv Kalb. Double disc court was invented and introduced in the early 1970s by Jim Palmeri. In 1974, freestyle competition was created and introduced by Ken Westerfield and Discrafts Jim Kenner. Judging standards were developed by the Freestyle Players Association. In 1976, the game of disc golf was standardized with targets called \"pole holes\" invented and developed by Wham-O's Ed Headrick and the Professional Disc Golf Association.\n\nBeginning in 1974, the International Frisbee Association (IFA), under the direction of Dan Roddick, became the regulatory organization for all of these sports.\n\nUltimate (also called Ultimate Frisbee) is a competitive non-contact team sport. The object of the game is to score points by passing the disc to a team member in the opposing teams end zone. Players may not run while holding the disc. Catching is done with one hand or both hands on the rim or hands simultaneously on the top and bottom sometimes referred to as a clap-catch. When one-hand catching on the rim, care must always be taken in hand placement and making sure to catch on the correct side of the disc, according to which way the disc is spinning. One side will tend to spin out of your hand, while the other side will spin into your hand, making for a more secure catch. Many players avoid this problem by always catching with both hands when possible. The most popular throws used in a game of ultimate are backhand, sidearm/forehand, hammer and scoober. Being a deep threat with multiple throwing techniques and the ability to pass the disc before the defense has had a chance to re-set, is always optimal. Some players use a throw and catch freestyle practice to help improve their ultimate handling skills. The game was invented in 1968 as an evening pastime by Jared Kass. Ultimate is distinguished by its Spirit of the Game - the principles of fair play, sportsmanship, and the joy of play. USA Ultimate and Ultimate Canada are the rules and sanctioning organizations for ultimate in the US and Canada. The American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) and Major League Ultimate (MLU) are the first semi professional ultimate leagues. The Major League Ultimate (MLU) ceased operation on December 21, 2016.\n\nA number of games have evolved which are derived or similar to Ultimate, but played with different rules. These games are often played when available fields or teams are too small for a full sized ultimate game.\n\nDisc golf is a game based on the rules of golf (referred to by disc golfers as \"ball and stick golf\"). It uses discs smaller and denser than an ultimate disc. The discs are thrown towards a target, which serves as the \"hole\". The official targets are metal baskets with hanging chains to catch the discs.\n\nBefore there were standardized targets called pole holes, disc golf used to be played in parks and urban settings using natural objects as targets. In some cases courses were created by the players themselves as they played, with each player taking turns determining targets and throwing designations (mandatories and out of bounds)\n\nDisc freestyle, also known as freestyle Frisbee in reference to the trademarked brand name, is a sport and performing art characterized by creative, acrobatic, and athletic maneuvers with a flying disc. Freestyle is performed individually or more commonly in groups, both competitively and recreationally. Freestyle, in the early 1970s, before the invention of the \"nail-delay\", catching possibilities would depend on the throw you were given, it was always spontaneous and unpredictable. Play of this type of freestyle was performed with two players standing 30-40 yards apart, the throws were fast and varied and the catches were right off the throw, except for the occasional kick or slap-up and rarely a pause between the catch and the throw back. At advanced levels, the throws and catches would become a flow that was created once you mastered the basics. It was fast and fluid and visibly would resemble martial arts and dance. Most competitive freestyle today centers around the nail-delay with many players using what are called delay-aids (plastic nails and silicone sprays).\n\nMany players of other disc sports will often use a throw and catch (no plastic nails or sprays) version of freestyle, to warm up for their disc games. Ultimate disc players often use freestyle to improve their throwing and catching skills as well as a good way to add focus and flexibility to their game.\n\nFreestyle competition is an event where teams of two or three players perform a routine which consists of a series of creative throwing and catching techniques set to music. The routine is judged on the basis of difficulty, execution and presentation. The team with the best total score is declared the winner.\n\nIn 1974, Ken Westerfield and Jim Kenner (founder and CEO of Discraft), introduce and win the first flying disc freestyle competition at the 3rd annual Canadian Open Frisbee Championships, Toronto, Ontario, Canada and the Vancouver Open Frisbee Championships. These were the first Frisbee freestyle competitions.\n\nA year later the American Flying Disc Open (AFDO) Rochester, New York, the Octad in New Brunswick, New Jersey and the 1975 World Frisbee Championships, held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, adopted Westerfield and Kenners freestyle competition format as one of their events. Today this same freestyle event is now accepted as one of the premier events in Flying disc tournaments worldwide.\n\nThe Freestyle Players Association was formed to oversee the competitive aspects of freestyle frisbee, and to help new players learn how to freestyle.\n\nGuts or Guts Frisbee is a disc sport inspired by dodgeball, involving teams throwing a flying disc (rather than balls) at members of the opposing team. One to five team members stand in a line facing the opposing team across the court, with the two teams lined up parallel to each other. Which team begins play is determined \"flipping the disc\", an action similar to a coin toss, but using the disc itself. One member of the team is then selected to start play.\nThat member then raises an arm to indicate readiness to throw, at which point the members of the opposing team freeze in position. If the thrower misses the \"scoring area\" (a demarcated area a bit larger than the space occupied by the opposing team), the receiving team scores a point. If a member of the receiving team catches the disc cleanly, neither team scores a point. If the throw is within the scoring area and the receiving team fails to catch, or catches but drops the disc, the throwing team gets a point. The receiving team then picks up the disc and becomes the throwing team. The receiving team must catch the disc cleanly in one hand, and may not move from position until after the disc leaves the hand of the thrower. The disc may not be trapped between the hand and any other part of the body, including the other hand. This frequently results in a challenging sequence of \"tips\" or \"bobbles\", which are rebounds of the disc off of receivers' hands or body to slow the disc down and keep it in play until it can be caught. This often involves multiple players on the receiving team.\nPlay continues until at least 21 points have been scored by one of the teams and there is a difference in score of at least 2 points.\n\nDouble disc court (DDC) invented and introduced by Frisbee Hall of Fame inductee Jim Palmeri of Rochester, NY, is a sport played with two flying discs. Two teams of two players each stand in their own courts. The goal is to defend a court from an attack by the opposing team. Two identical square courts are located on a level playing field of grass measuring 13 meters on a side. The distance between the courts is 17 meters. Attacks are made in two ways: by throwing a disc in play into the opponents' court in an attempt to have the disc come to rest within that court without ever having touched out-of-bounds, or by causing both discs to be touched by a player or players on the opposing team at the same time (called a \"double\"). A team scores a point whenever they make a successful attack or whenever an opponent throws a disc out-of-bounds. The first team to score the requisite number of points as determined by the competitive format wins the game.\n\nCanine Disc (or dog disc) is a dog sport and a disc sport. In canine disc competitions, dogs and their human flying disc throwers compete in events such as distance catching and somewhat choreographed freestyle catching. The sport celebrates the bond between handler and dog, by allowing them to work together.\n\nThese games originated when the rules of another game were adjusted to use a flying disc in place of a ball.\n\n\n\n"}

The film is based on the true story of baseball pitchers Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel who were discovered by sports agent J. B. Bernstein after winning a reality show competition.\n\nThe film stars Jon Hamm as J. B. Bernstein, Bill Paxton as pitching coach Tom House, Suraj Sharma as Singh, Madhur Mittal as Patel, and Alan Arkin. The film's music is composed by A. R. Rahman. Produced by Joe Roth, Mark Ciardi, and Gordon Gray, the film was released theatrically on May 16, 2014. \"Million Dollar Arm\" grossed $39.2 million and received mixed-to-positive reviews.\n\nJ. B. Bernstein is a big-time sports agent who, along with his partner Ash Vasudevan, recently formed their own company. Unfortunately, all of J. B.'s clients have retired, and he is unable to reel in star football player Popo Vanuatu. Desperate to find new clients, J. B. realizes India, with over one billion people, has real potential for untapped baseball talent. He approaches investor Mr. Chang with his proposal—a talent contest staged in India called \"Million Dollar Arm.\" Contestants score points by demonstrating they can pitch a baseball with speed and accuracy. Along with the prize money, two winners will be flown to the U.S. and receive coaching to become legitimate baseball prospects within two years. Chang commits to providing the funding, on the condition the prospects are ready within only one year. With no alternative, J. B. reluctantly assures Chang the winners will be ready for a major-league try-out within one year.\n\nJ. B. approaches veteran baseball pitching coach Tom House who explains that cricket, the main sport played in India, and baseball have very different motions for bowling and pitching, and getting a good recruit ready for a try-out in one year is extremely unlikely, if not impossible. J. B. points how House has nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking up the challenge, and House agrees.\n\nWhile Ash is holding down the fort in Los Angeles, J. B. flies to India. He is bewildered by the traffic, the overcrowding, and the lax way Indians conduct business. He is joined by the curmudgeonly Ray Poitevint, a longtime major league scout, and hires Amit Rohan as his interpreter. After lengthy try-outs in numerous cities, two youngsters emerge as the winners — Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel, and they are flown to the U.S. to begin their baseball training. The pair, who grew up in poverty in India and do not speak or understand English, are instantly overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of America, although Rinku immediately develops a liking for pizza. Things soon come to a crunch when they are detained by hotel security for messing with elevator emergency controls, inadvertently getting themselves stuck and setting off the fire alarm. J. B. is subsequently forced to invite them to stay at his home. For their baseball training, J. B. dumps the pair by House and his staff while he runs off to close more deals. In being treated so, the pair feels like social outcasts. J. B.'s tenant Brenda Fenwick is the only person who genuinely seems interested in their well-being.\n\nWhen J. B. takes the boys and Amit to a party thrown by Popo, whom J. B. hopes to sign, things get worse when Amit gets drunk after mistakenly drinking a punch with alcohol and Rinku becomes sick from overeating and as a result, both vomit on J. B.'s windshield, forcing an enraged J. B. to drive them home, and forfeit the deal with Popo, who signed with someone else. Brenda calms him down and makes him realize he is treating the two boys like a business deal. The next day, J. B. trades in his Porsche for a Dodge Caravan and joins the boys for their prayers. Ignoring J. B.'s pleas of the two boys' lack of readiness, Chang insists his terms be fulfilled and the boys demonstrate their baseball skills one year from the time they arrived in the US. ESPN, \"Sports Illustrated\", and local media are joined by numerous major-league scouts to watch the boys pitch. The try-out is a complete disaster, as the pair is both very nervous and pitch without speed or control, failing to impress anyone.\n\nBrenda convinces J. B. that the boys be given another try-out. Chang refused to go along with it, and no scouts are interested in wasting their time on another fiasco. All hope is lost until Ray arranges for J. B. to meet the Pittsburgh Pirates head scout who was away in Puerto Rico for the first try-out, and agrees to come. Chang changes his mind and sees the second try-out of Singh and Patel. This time, J. B. insists the boys relax and have fun. The scouts are quickly impressed as the pair consistently deliver 90+ mph fastballs thrown accurately, and both are offered a contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates. \n\nUnfortunately, on the boys way back to India for a final reunion with their families, they are killed in a plane crash. The movie ends with a slow and dark shot of J.B. receiving this news and passing out. This twist is completely unexpected and many argue that it takes away from the film's overall vibe. Disney executives stand behind this creative choice and received much flak as a result.\n\n\n\nESPN personalities Jayson Stark, Karl Ravech, and Steve Levy, as well as retired Major League Baseball players Barry Larkin and Curt Schilling, have cameo appearances in the film.\n\nIn 2008, television sports producers and brothers Neil and Michael Mandt began documenting the training and tryouts that Singh and Patel were undergoing at the USC campus. Using original footage they had shot, they created a nine-minute trailer as a presentation piece for a projected movie about the two players. In December 2008, the Mandts began a collaboration with producers Mark Ciardi, Gordon Gray and Joe Roth. In early 2009, the screen rights to Singh and Patel's life story were purchased by Sony Pictures Entertainment for development at Columbia Pictures, which hired Mitch Glazer to write a screenplay.\n\nThe project was eventually put in turnaround and in 2010, producers Roth and Ciardi set the film up at Walt Disney Pictures. Upon acquiring the film, Disney hired Thomas McCarthy to write a script. In May 2012, Jon Hamm was hired to play J. B. Bernstein. Alan Arkin and Suraj Sharma were hired in April 2013, with Allyn Rachel joining the cast the following month. Principal photography began on May 30, 2013 with filming taking place in Mumbai, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.\n\nA. R. Rahman composed the film's score. The soundtrack album was digitally released by Walt Disney Records on May 13, 2014 whereas the CD release was released on May 19, 2014.\n\nThe first trailer was released on December 23, 2013 and attached theatrically with \"Saving Mr. Banks\". Disney heavily promoted the film through its ESPN division, with Bill Simmons being credited an executive producer on the film. The film was fully screened at CinemaCon in March 2014, wherein Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn claimed that it was the highest-tested film during his tenure at either Disney or Warner Bros., including the first \"Harry Potter\" film. The film held its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre on May 6, 2014.\n\n\"Million Dollar Arm\" was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on October 7, 2014.\n\n\"Million Dollar Arm\" grossed $36.5 million in North America and $2.8 million in other territories for a total gross of $39.2 million, against a budget of $25 million.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $10.5 million, finishing in fourth place at the box office behind fellow new release \"Godzilla\" ($95.1 million), as well as \"Neighbors\" ($25.2 million) and \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" ($16.8 million).\n\nThe film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that prior to release \"Million Dollar Arm\" received a 65% approval rating from critics, based on 141 reviews with an average score of 6/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Pleasant to a fault, \"Million Dollar Arm\" is a middle-of-the-plate pitch that coasts on Jon Hamm's considerable charm without adding any truly original curves to Disney's inspirational sports formula.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 56 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nScott Foundas of \"Variety\" described the film as a \"sharp, slickly produced addition to the Disney sports movie canon [that] works as both a stirring underdog tale and as a revealing look at the expanding global footprint of the American sports-entertainment machine.\" Foundas also praised McCarthy's screenplay and Gillespie's direction, elaborating that they \"put across the movie's many cliches with a certain verve, and find room for unexpected detours and grace notes in an overall familiar trajectory.\" Michael Rechtshaffen of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote, \"Dutifully covering all the requisite inspirational sports movie/fish-out-of-water bases yet still managing to throw a few fresh curves into the mix, Disney's \"Million Dollar Arm\" assuredly hits a home run.\" Chris Nashawaty of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a \"B-\" grade, comparing it to \"Jerry Maguire\", and calling Hamm's performance as one of film's highlights.\n\nAlonso Duralde of \"The Wrap\" criticized the film's predictability and excessive sentimentality.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences placed \"Million Dollar Arm\" on its shortlist of potential nominees for the Academy Award for Best Original Score and Best Original Song (for \"Million Dollar Dream\", \"Spreading the Word/Makhna\", and \"We Could Be Kings\"), but ultimately was not nominated for either award.\n\n"}

The title of official also applies to the scorers and timekeepers, as well as other personnel that have an active task in maintaining the game. Basketball is regarded as among the most difficult sports to officiate due to the speed of play, complexity of rules, the case-specific interpretations of rules, and the instantaneous decision required.\n\nThere is one lead referee and one or two umpires, depending on whether there is a two- or three-person crew. In the NBA, the lead official is called the crew chief and the other two officials are referees. In FIBA-sanctioned play, two-man crews consist of a referee and an umpire, and three-man crews contain a referee and two umpires. \n\nRegardless, both classes of officials have equal rights to control almost all aspects of the game. In most cases, the lead official (in FIBA, the referee) performs the jump ball to begin the contest, though NFHS and NCAA have allowed the referee to designate which official (referee or umpire) shall perform the jump ball.\n\nIn American high school and college basketball, officials wear black-and-white-striped shirts with black side panels, black pants, and black shoes. Some state high school association allow officials to wear grey shirts with black pin-stripes instead of black-and-white-striped shirts. \n\nNBA officials wear light grey shirts with black slacks and black shoes. The NBA shirt is light grey with one black colored stripe on either shoulder, a black stripe on either side, the official's number in the center at the top on the back, and the NBA logo above the breast. NBA officials sometimes wear alternate uniforms consisting of a white shirt with light gold shoulders and black stripes. NBA Summer League officials wear the same light grey shirt but with blue shoulders. The WNBA referee shirt is similar to the NBA referee shirt except that its shoulder and sleeve colors are orange, and the WNBA logo takes the place of the NBA logo. \n\nFIBA officials wear a grey (torso) and black (sleeves) shirt, black trousers, black socks, and black shoes. Officials in competitions organized by Euroleague Basketball – the Euroleague and Eurocup – wear an orange shirt. Officials in the Israel Basketball Association wear the Euroleague's orange shirt but sometimes wear royal blue shirts for contests between two Israeli teams. NBL officials wear grey shirts with black shoulders and orange stripes on the sides. The NBL logo is atop the breast and a sponsor's name is on the back. Shirts are V-neck, without a collar, and pants lack belts.\n\nAll officials wear a whistle that is used to stop play as a result of a foul or a violation on the court. Hand signals are used to indicate the nature of the infraction or to administer the game.\n\nIn higher levels of college and professional basketball, officials wear a timing device on the belt-line called PTS (Precision Timing System). The device is used by on court officials to start and stop the game clock in a timely manner, rather than waiting for the scoreboard operator (timekeeper) to do so.\n\nThe officials must ensure that the game runs smoothly, and this encompasses a variety of different responsibilities, from calling the game to player and spectator management. They also carry a duty of care to the players they officiate and to ensure that the court and all equipment used is in a safe and usable condition. Should there be an issue that inhibits the safe playing of the game, then it is the job of the officials to rectify the problem. Quite often, the job of an official surpasses that of the game at hand, as they must overcome unforeseen situations that may or may not have an influence on the game.\n\nThere are two standard methods for officiating a basketball game, either \"two-person\" or \"three-person\" mechanics depending on how many officials are available to work the game. \nIn \"two-person\" mechanics, each official works either the lead or the trail position. The lead position is normally along the baseline of the court, with the trail position having its starting point at the free throw line extended on the left side of the court facing the basket. Officials change position often during the game to cover the area in the best possible way. As the game transitions from one end of the court to the other, the lead becomes the trail and vice versa. Between the two positions, each is responsible for a specific part of the court as well as two each of the side, base or back court lines. Officials change position after certain calls (mostly when the lead official calls a defensive foul). This allows officials to alternate between positions to increase the speed of play; one official will approach the bench whilst another, usually the closest to the bench at that time, will move to occupy his position. This also prevents one official from always working one particular team's basket throughout the course of the game.\n\nIn \"three-person\" mechanics, the court is further divided among three officials, with the lead (baseline) official determining the position of the other two officials. Normally, the lead official will move to the side of the court in which the ball is located (strong side), particularly if there is a \"post-up\" player in that position. The official that is on the same sideline as the lead official then takes up a position approximately level with the top of the three-point line and becomes the \"trail\" official, while the third official will stand across the court near the free throw line in what is called the center position. This creates a triangle coverage of the court. Often, the lead will switch sides of the baseline during a play, requiring the trail to move down to be level with the free-throw line and become the new center, while the center will move up and become the trail. As the ball moves to the other end of the court in transition, the lead will become the trail, the trail will become the lead, and the center official will remain in the center (unless the new \"lead\" moves across the baseline to cover the strong side, in which case the center official and trail would then switch positions.)\n\nBasketball is regarded by many fans as among the most difficult sports to officiate. Usually basketball officials have only a brief moment to determine if an infraction has occurred, due to the speed of play of the game and the officials' proximity to the action. Especially difficult is the \"charge/block\" call as to which player is responsible for contact. Officials often rely on instant replay to review plays.\n\nDespite the misconception that basketball is a non-contact sport, officials often let a large amount of marginal or incidental contact pass uncalled. An official must always be wary of not just what is happening around the ball, but the roughness of play going on around the whole court, adding to the job of the official.\n\nFurther complicating the job of an official is the proximity to the crowds. Unlike football or baseball, the crowd is nearly always located within a few feet of the official, as are coaches and other players on the bench. To combat this, officials are able to remove a fan from the arena with an ejection.\n\nWhen a violation occurs, game action is immediately stopped. These include traveling, illegal dribbles, out-of-bounds, and other violations. The official is required to blow the whistle and immediately stop play and award the ball over to the opposing team which allows for fair play in the game.\n"}

It is the only nordic centre in the world with eight hills in one place and the only one of this kind with hills of all sizes at one place: small, medium, normal, large and flying hills.\n\nThe origins of ski flying started in 1936 in Planica, when 18-year-old Austrian Josef \"Sepp\" Bradl became the first man in history to land a ski jump of over 100 metres (330 ft). It is a place where the most of the ski jumping world records were set on two different hills, and also the historic first jumps over 100 meters by Sepp Bradl on Bloudkova velikanka and over 200 meters by Toni Nieminen on Letalnica bratov Gorišek. Complex consists of eight hills in function and three abandoned hills. Sigmund Ruud gave Bloudkova velikanka name \"Mammoth Hill\". In 2015, the complete reconstruction was finished with total new cross-country skiing track derived through the valley of Planica.\n\nLetalnica bratov Gorišek flying hill is also hosting annual Red Bull 400 world series event, the stepeest 400 metres uphill run in the world, with over 1,000 competitors from around the globe.\n\nLetalnica bratov Gorišek (English: \"Flying hill of Gorišek brothers\") is a 1969 ski flying hill located in Planica, Slovenia. Hill is named after the original constructors and brothers Vlado (alias \"Lado\") and Janez Gorišek. With total of 28 world records set it is the world leading ski jump hill in this statistics. They installed the world's steepest zip-line with average incline at 38.33% (20.9°) and maximum incline at 58.7% (30.5°) which opened on 19 September 2015.\n\nIt's the biggest of totally eight hills at Planica Nordic Centre. Yugoslavian ski jumper Miro Oman was honoured to make a premiere 135 m (443 ft) long jump on 6 March 1969 at hill test. The first ever FIS Ski Flying World Championships was organized on this hill in 1972. After Matti Nykänen set world record 191 meters at SFWC 1985, new rule by FIS was accepted where no points for jumps over this distance was awarded in order to prevent world record hunting. On 17 March 1994 Andreas Goldberger touched the snow with his hand at 202 m and made first ever over two hundred meters jump, but it was invalid. Just a few minutes later Toni Nieminen landed on his feet at 203 m and officially became the first man in history who jumped over two hundred meters. This hill is a historic place where a man for the first time jumped over 200 m.\n\nBloudkova velikanka (also: \"Rožman/Bloudkova velikanka\", \"Old Bloudkova velikanka\", \"Large Rožman/Bloudek Hill\", \"Mammoth Hill\") is a large ski jump hill in Planica, Slovenia opened in 1934 by Joso Gorec's initiative. Hill was originally constructed by Ivan Rožman, that's why he resent that hill was first named after Stanko Bloudek and not him and backed up. Posthumous and many years later they credited and honoured him to rename hill as Rožman/Bloudkova velikanka. A year after opening Stanko Bloudek became in charge as main constructor improving this hill 'till his death and with his vision and skills made Planica world-famous and brought ski jumping/ski flying to a whole new dimension. As a constructor he is credited with thirteen world records and first jump in history over 100 metres in 1936 and that's how new discipline was born right on this hill. Hill's axis and name are under national monument protection and can not be changed. After almost a decade of hibernation hill was completely renovated with same characteristics as old one and opened in 2012. Right next to this one they built a brand new normal hill, which replaced the old demolished one. They chose this location mostly because of their bid for the Nordic World Ski Championships.\n\n\nZip-line on the flying hill is the steepest in the world with 40 seconds of adrenalin fall. It was installed by Slovenian ski manufacturer Elan in August 2015. It's the first ever zip line installed on any of ski flying hills around the world. Former Slovenian alpine skier Jure Košir was honoured to be the first person who tested and descended down on 1 September 2015. For daily visitors and tourists was opened on 19 September 2015.\n\n\n\nHe is known as the \"creator\" of Planica, key figure and the most significant person in the whole story. All credits go to him, without him there will be nothing. He was a Slovene sport worker, sport enthusiast and member of \"Ilirija Sport Club\". His intention was to build the biggest hill in the world and to make relatively unknown Slovenia famous. He is the initiator and responsible that \"Ilirija House\", now called \"Planica House\", was built in 1931. A year later Gorec asked his club co-worker, engineer Stanko Bloudek, to draw plans for large hill. Bloudek draw plans for K80 hill, as much as International Ski Federation rules allowed at that time and found the fantastic location for it. But in 1933, suddenly out of nowhere Ivan Rožman, a construction company's owner working at time in Planica, draw plans for new, bigger K90 hill, now known as Bloudkova velikanka. Joso Gorec decided to rather build the hill by his plans. Another big achievement if Gorec was his fight for recognition of Planica and ski-flying as new discipline in annual FIS congress held in 1938 in Helsinki. He was defending plans of Stanko Bloudek, who didn't want to go there. Gorec fantastically presented Planica and ski-flying in front of FIS. But he was lucky to get a full support from Arnold Lunn, who had the same problems with FIS years ago at recognition of slalom. Lunn told FIS that they or anyone else couldn't stop ski-flying in Planica. After the end of presentation, Gorec said that FIS adopted rules only for K80 and not yet have any rules for a new discipline called ski-flying. He invited FIS to accept new rules for ski-flying as soon as possible. After this meeting FIS allowed ski-flying but only in study purposes.\n\nOriginal constructor of K-90 Bloudkova velikanka hill, which was built in two months, from October to December 1933 hill was completed. Opening competition was National Championships in February 1934, where Rožman as a first person in history used snow cement. Gorec gave him and his company permission to build the hill. He contributed all the money for the construction, together with two other business partners: manufacturer Rado Hribar from Ljubljana and with father of Slovene actor Demeter Bitenc who was renting \"Bitenc Hotels\". At first locals didn't want to sell the land needed for construction and the local priest Lavtižar preached to locals at liturgy and convinced them to sell the land. Soon after hill was opened Rožman and Bloudek got into conflict about original authorship and name of Bloudkova velikanka. While Joso Gorec took side with his friend Bloudek, he step out as constructor. Soon a year later Bloudek continued his work on Bloudkova velikanka. Rožman died in 1937 and conflict about authorship was forgotten for many years. Many years later they recognized him as original constructor. The full official name of the hill is now \"Rožman/Bloudkova velikanka\".\n\nStanko Bloudek was a constructor and the father of the first ever ski flying hill. In 1932 he was hired by Joso Gorec to draw plans for hill with size K-80. He drew plans and found an excellent location in Planica, but didn't make to realize his plans at first. Ivan Rožman who draw plans for K-90 built the original \"Bloudkova velikanka\" on location found by Bloudek. He took the one-year-old hill over in 1935, then upgraded it, enlarged it and improved it several times until his death in 1959. He is responsible for eleven world records on Bloudkova velikanka and for the first jump over 100 meters in 1936. \"Bloudkova velikanka\" was unfairly named after him, although original plan wasn't his, but he was closer to Gorec who decided about everything.\n\nVlado Gorišek (1925–1997), born in Ljubljana, more known as Lado, was the older brother of Janez Gorišek. He is known as co-constructor of Letalnica bratov Gorišek, a flying hill built in 1969, although he didn't actually draw the plans, but his younger brother Janez did while he was working in Libya in the 1960s.\n\nJanez Gorišek and his older brother Vlado are born in Ljubljana and they together constructed the flying hill in 1969. Janez was the main mastermind who actually draw the plans alone, but he could not be present at the construction site, because at the time he was working in Libya. However, his brother Vlado was present at the construction site from the start to the end as the main supervisor with nonstop contacts to his younger brother Janez through telephone and mail. They are responsible for a hill with the most world records, twenty-eight and for the first jump in history over 200 meters in 1994.\n\nList of all world records from both large and flying hill. Some sources claim that three world records set on 2 March 1941 by Franz Mair (109 m), Hans Lahr (111 m) and Paul Krauß (112 m) on large hill were actually not world records. They claim those jumps were actually set after Rudi Gering's 118 m world record.\n\nRed Bull 400 is an extreme running-up-the-hill sport event sponsored by Red Bull. It is the steepest uphill race that takes place in Europe. It is a tough 400-meter vertical sprint up the face of a ski-jump slope in Planica, Slovenia. Runners have to beat 400 meters distance from bottom to the top of the inrun of the flying hill. Runners coming from all over Europe had to beat steepest part 38° angle on the older hill and at 36° on modernized hill. First two editions on the Letalnica bratov Gorišek were held in 2012 and 2013 and cancelled in 2014 because the hill was under renovation. Competition returned in 2015 on a modernized and even bigger hill than before with totally new concrete inrun.\n\n"}

{"id": "13379267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13379267", "title": "Sebenza", "text": "Sebenza\n\nThe Sebenza is a folding pocket knife manufactured by Chris Reeve Knives of Boise, Idaho. It is constructed with a stainless steel blade and titanium handle. Its handle functions as the lock mechanism similar in concept to the Walker linerlock differing in that the handle itself forms the lock bar which holds the blade open. This mechanism was invented by Chris Reeve, and is called the Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L). It is also commonly referred to as the Framelock, and is one of the most widely implemented locking systems in the folding knife industry, where lock strength and reliability is a product requirement. The name Sebenza is derived from the Zulu word meaning \"Work,\" a tribute to Mr. Reeve's South African origins.\n\nThere are currently two size models of the Sebenza 21, small and large. The Small 21 has a 2.94\" (75mm) blade and the Large 21 has a 3.625\" (92mm) blade.\n\nFirst introduced in 1990, the current basic model has a sand-blasted titanium handle and a stonewashed finish CPM S35VN steel blade.\nThere are numerous options for the embellishment of the Sebenza's titanium handles, such as computer-generated graphics, custom (unique) graphics, or inlays such as exotic wood, micarta, or mammoth ivory.\nOriginally the Chris Reeve Sebenza was available with a blade of ATS-34 steel. \nIn 1996, the blade material was changed to BG-42 blade steel, and later in 2001, the Sebenza blade material transitioned to CPM S30V steel. CPM S30V was developed by Crucible Steel with the collaboration of Chris Reeve. Damascus steel blades are also available as an option on the Sebenza. Since 2012, all Chris Reeve knives have transitioned to CPM S35VN steel.\nA feature of the Sebenza that is highly praised by users is the ease of maintenance, as CRK actually encourages the customer to disassemble and maintain the knife by including a hex wrench, as well as small tube of fluorinated grease (to lubricate the pivot) and a tube of Loctite (for screws) in the box. Another feature of the Sebenza is the use of a bushing system around the blade's pivot that keeps the blade at a constant tight fit which is always centered.\nThis bushing allows the user to tighten the pivot screw completely without having to manually adjust the pivot tension.\n\nAs of May 2008, the two production models—the Regular and Classic Sebenza models—were discontinued and replaced by the 'Sebenza 21' (named so as to commemorate the 21st year of the Sebenza's production). The Sebenza 21 is based upon the previous Classic's design, and differs from the Classic only in small details.\n\nAt the 2012 Blade Show the 'Sebenza 25' (named so as to commemorate the 25th year of the Sebenza's production) was introduced. Significant changes include a more sculpted handle, the introduction of a ceramic ball lockup/detent system and the use of 'Large Hollow Grind Technology\" on the blade grind. The 21 model continues in production as well. The 'Sebenza 25' was discontinued in mid-2016 and replaced by the Inkosi which shares many similarities with the 25 but with additional refinements.\n\n1987: Knifemaker’s Guild of Southern Africa -- \"Best Folding Knife\" (Sebenza predecessor)\n1993: Knifemakers' Guild -- \"Most Innovative Folder at the Show\" \n2005: Blade Show -- \"Collector Knife of the Year\" (21st Anniversary Sebenza) \n2006: Grays Sporting Journal -- “Gray's Best” Award\n\n\"Knives Illustrated\" magazine named the industry's top five tactical folders of all time.\nThe author, Abe Elias, describes a tactical folder as \"a knife used by people who need a dependable piece of solidly build equipment, a folder that gives you -- in all cases -- confidence\".\nHis article goes on to say that \"At the top of the list is the Sebenza by Chris Reeve.\"\n\n"}

It is the home ballpark of the Minnesota Twins, the state's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. It also has served as the occasional home of Minnesota Golden Gophers baseball, and other local and regional baseball events.\n\nThe ballpark officially opened with a capacity of 39,504 on April 12, 2010, and has since hosted the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\n\nIt is an open-air ballpark, and not considered \"roof-ready\" in any way. Though designed as a baseball venue, it can accommodate football, soccer, and outdoor concerts. Its extensive banquet and conference facilities are marketed for corporate and other non-Twins and non-baseball events.\n\nIn 2010, \"ESPN The Magazine\" ranked Target Field as the #1 baseball stadium experience in North America.\n\nTarget Field is the Twins/Senators sixth ballpark, and the franchise's third in Minnesota. The Twins had played 28 seasons at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, and before that 21 seasons at Metropolitan Stadium. The Twins shared both facilities with the Minnesota Vikings, and the Metrodome with the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football team.\n\nThe final budget for construction was $435 million, of which $175 million was paid by the Twins and $260 million was paid by Hennepin County by way of a 0.15% county-wide sales tax. An additional $120 million in infrastructure costs were split between the county ($90 million), the team ($20 million), Target Corporation ($4.5 million), the Minnesota Department of Transportation ($3.5 million) and the Minnesota Ballpark Authority ($2 million) bringing the project's total cost to US$555 million.\n\nThe Twins were in their 13 season in the Metrodome when they formally declared their desire to find a new home on July 18, 1994. Carl Pohlad, owner of the Twins, told the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission (owners of the Metrodome) the current facility was \"economically obsolete\" due to changes in the economy of Major League Baseball. This declaration started a process which would culminate nearly 16 years later with the opening of Target Field. In the intervening years, many ideas, financing plans and possible locations came and went. The long process included threats of relocation, infighting between the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and numerous pieces of legislation (both passed and not passed) at various levels of government. The process spanned the terms of three Minnesota governors, five mayors of Minneapolis or St. Paul, and even two long-tenured Twins managers.\n\n1961 – The original Washington Senators become the Minnesota Twins, and move to Metropolitan Stadium\n\n1982 – Twins move to HHH Metrodome\n\n1984 – Calvin Griffith sells Twins to Carl Pohlad\n\n1994 – Pohlad declares Metrodome “economically obsolete”\n\n1996 – First new ballpark plan fails to win support\n\n1997 – Second new ballpark plan fails to win support; Minneapolis stadium contributions capped by referendum\n\n1998 – Referendum to build ballpark in Greensboro, NC fails\n\n1999 – Referendum to build ballpark in St. Paul, MN fails\n\n2000 – Eventual site of Target Field identified\n\n2001 – Twins become part of MLB’s “contraction” plans\n\n2002 – Hennepin County makes its first financing proposal; St. Paul options eliminated\n\n2005 – Twins and Hennepin County reach financing agreement\n\n2006 – Ballpark legislation enacted\n\n2007 – Construction begins, land dispute settled\n\n2010 – Twins move to Target Field\n\nImmediately following Pohlad's 1994 declaration of intent, the Twins began making plans to build a new, retractable-roof stadium on a site just north of the Metrodome. Extensive conceptual work went into the site and stadium. At that time, the desired site was largely underused as surface parking, despite being adjacent to the Mississippi River, and located in the city's historic milling district. It included land which would be used for the Guthrie Theater (2006), Gold Medal Park (2007), and high-end housing.\n\nThe riverfront plan formed the basis for all of the early discussions, and was first presented to the Minnesota Legislature during the 1996 session. It did not pass, largely due to widespread public sentiment that Pohlad, Minnesota's second most wealthy citizen, should pay for a new facility himself.\n\nAfter that failure, private negotiations between Pohlad and Governor Arne Carlson yielded a deal which was brought to the 1997 legislative session. The Twins had agreed to make an up-front financial contribution to kick-start the project, as well as sell 49% of team ownership to the state. This plan unraveled when local media reported that the complicated \"contribution\" to be made by the team amounted to a loan from Pohlad which was to be repaid with interest. Public outrage made passing this plan impossible.\n\nLater that same year, the voters in Minneapolis overwhelmingly approved a referendum which prevented the city of Minneapolis from ever spending more than $10 million on a professional sports facility without approval from voters. This effectively removed the city from consideration as a financial partner for a new Twins ballpark.\n\nMeanwhile, the Twins’ Metrodome lease was set to expire in 1998. Governor Carlson felt the issue pressing enough that he called a special session of the Minnesota Legislature for that fall. In advance of the session, Pohlad announced he had signed a letter of intent to sell the team to a potential ownership group in North Carolina (Piedmont Triad) led by Don Beaver. The sale would be nullified if either a new stadium was approved in Minnesota, or a referendum to build a new stadium in Greensboro failed.\n\nThe Minnesota legislature not only defeated the stadium bill, but passed a resolution urging Congress to intervene in what it saw to be the worst practices of professional sports. Then, on May 5, 1998, voters in Greensboro rejected the ballpark referendum by a wide margin and the sale of the team was cancelled. Meanwhile, the public had come to view Pohlad very unfavorably.\n\nSt. Paul mayor Norm Coleman jumped into this void with an enthusiastic pitch to move the Twins to his city. Several downtown locations were offered, the most likely option being adjacent to the new Xcel Energy Center (though another site considered was in the Lowertown neighborhood, a location which eventually became CHS Field, home of the St. Paul Saints). A referendum was scheduled to ask St. Paul voters to approve a sales tax increase for the city's contribution to the project, which would have been an open-air ballpark. Once again, Pohlad agreed to \"sell\" the team contingent upon the outcome of a referendum. This sale would have been to a group led by Minnesota-based billionaires Glen Taylor and Robert Naegele. Because Pohlad was so unpopular, it was thought that removing him from the transaction might help the prospects of the referendum, but it did not. On November 2, 1999, St. Paul voters rejected the plan by a large margin and the concept quickly evaporated.\n\nThe threat of the Twins moving to St. Paul had caught the attention of the business community in Minneapolis, which, up to this point, had been largely silent on the issue. During the run-up to the St. Paul referendum in 1999, an independent working group was formed by Minneapolis businessmen Bruce Lambrecht and Rich Pogin, representatives of a group of investors which owned the Rapid Park parking lot in the historic warehouse district on the northern edge of downtown Minneapolis. This group, initially known as Minnesota Urban Ballpark, and later as MN Twinsville, formed with the express purpose of bringing their land into the discussion about sites for a new Twins ballpark.\n\nAt first, the 8-acre site appeared to be an extremely unlikely location for a modern professional baseball facility. Besides being far smaller than most MLB sites (modern facilities typically require 16-20 acres), it was hemmed in by railroad tracks, a freeway, and two city streets passing on bridges. Though very near to Target Center, it was also adjacent to the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center (HERC), more commonly known as the city's \"garbage burner,\" considered by some to be an undesirable neighbor for a ballpark.\n\nBut the site’s perceived liabilities were easily offset by significant assets. Careful measurements were made by Lambrecht and local architect David Albersman, which proved that there was enough room for a baseball field and the amenities associated with a Major League ballpark. The site was adjacent to three large, underused parking ramps, and at the potential nexus of a light rail line then being planned (ultimately the Metro Transit Blue Line), and a commuter rail line also under consideration (the eventual Northstar Line). It was also controlled by a single owner who would be a willing seller. This fact alone would significantly simplify the process of acquisition by a governmental entity for a large-scale project. Owing largely to these logistical advantages, as well as an expansive view of the Minneapolis skyline, and the persistence of Lambrecht and Pogin's group, this site would eventually come to house Target Field.\n\nIn early 2000, Lambrecht’s group commissioned a visit by Earl Santee of Populous (then known as HOK Sport) to evaluate whether the site had the potential to house Major League Baseball. His visit, independent of the Twins and all government entities, happened with no publicity whatsoever. Santee reviewed the site and reacted with skepticism, but saw no fatal flaws, nothing that made a ballpark impossible. He agreed to provide the working group with a concept drawing of a ballpark on that site, an image which was first published in August 2000, and quickly became the center of their ultimately successful campaign.\n\nAs Santee's dramatic drawing became more widely published, and Lambrecht and Pogin ramped up their lobbying efforts, others began to realize the advantages of the site. This included Mark Oyaas, founder of New Ballpark, Inc., a separate group of downtown Minneapolis business leaders, who sought to create a private financing plan for a stadium. They quickly settled on Rapid Park as their preferred ballpark site, which enhanced its visibility significantly. The Twins, however, completely ignored Rapid Park, and kept their distance from all of the ad hoc working groups. They would eventually go on record as believing that the Rapid Park site was too small and constrained to house the type of facility they sought to build.\n\nNo less than three committees were created in 2000 to offer recommendations on how to proceed.\n\nThe city of Minneapolis created a panel of citizens known as C-17 to consider various financing models. Their final report, issued in February 2001, while not specifically recommending a site, heavily featured the concept drawing of the Rapid Park site on multiple pages. The committee recommended that the city continue its discussions with New Ballpark, Inc., in the hopes of finding a private financing solution. Even before the work of the C-17 was complete, another (unnamed) group of staff analysts within city government, working with the Metropolitan Community Development Agency (MCDA), formally recommended the Rapid Park site to the City Council.\n\nSimultaneously, the Twins assembled a 130-member advisory group, dubbed Minnesotans for Major League Baseball, which met to discuss possible stadium alternatives. Their deliberations included a meeting with Bud Selig, commissioner of baseball, to discuss economic issues within the sport. Their final report did not recommend a site (and did not even mention Rapid Park), but did provide advice to the team on how to proceed in winning public approval for any plan.\n\nLate in 2000, Twins CEO Chris Clouser proposed playing three games in a temporary outdoor stadium to be built adjacent to the Mall of America in Bloomington, MN. He hoped to demonstrate the pleasures of outdoor baseball as a way of jump-starting the political process. The proposal ran into problems from insurance companies, the Minnesota Vikings (who stood to lose Metrodome revenue) and Major League Baseball. It was ultimately scrapped.\n\nDuring the 2001 legislative session, the Twins pushed for a new financing plan based on ideas gleaned from their advisory committee. The $300 million site-neutral plan would have featured a $150 million contribution from the Pohlads, $50 million from private enterprises, and the remaining $100 million in the form of an interest-free loan from the state of Minnesota. Many viewed the deal as significantly better for taxpayers than the 1997 plan. But the details of the financial arrangements once again were very complicated. Ultimately, the proposal fell victim to a political climate filled with distaste for the economics of baseball, general anti-stadium sentiments, and an unrelated budget standoff which nearly shut down the Minnesota government.\n\nDespite that legislative misfire, in the summer of 2001 the city of Minneapolis became quite serious about the warehouse district site for a ballpark, after selecting the Twins' preferred riverfront site to house the new Guthrie Theater. Though no deal was struck to purchase the Rapid Park land at that time, an initial valuation of $10 million was assumed by the city for a roughly 10 acre parcel. Though not a realistic amount, it did fall conveniently within the restrictions of the 1997 referendum. The Twins were not involved in these discussions, and still exhibited no public interest whatsoever in the warehouse district location.\n\nThe Twins, stung by the repeated rejections, and feeling that they had no real prospects for a new ballpark in the Twin Cities, next became officially associated with Major League Baseball's long-rumored \"contraction\" plans. On November 6, 2001, MLB owners voted 28-2 to authorize the elimination of two teams, the Twins and the Montreal Expos (though the teams were not named publicly). The Pohlads were reportedly offered a $250 million check to fold their franchise.\n\nThis attempt at placing more pressure on decision-makers ultimately failed -- spectacularly and quickly -- when, a mere 10 days later, Hennepin County District Court Judge Harry Crump ruled that the Twins, by virtue of Major League Baseball's federal anti-trust exemption, could not act as a typical business and simply buy out their Metrodome lease. Their standing as a community asset meant that they had an obligation to honor the lease and continue playing. His decision was upheld by the Minnesota Court of Appeals on January 21, 2002, and the Minnesota Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal on February 5, 2002, effectively ending contraction as a negotiating tactic (though its echoes would remain until a new labor agreement between MLB and the MLBPA was reached on August 30, 2002).\n\nEven as the Twins were forced to continue playing in 2002, the seeds of the eventual financing solution were sown when Hennepin County, in which the city of Minneapolis is located, began to express interest in being a financial partner in a ballpark. Unfortunately for the Twins, Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura wanted to foster competition between the various localities, thinking it would spur more creativity in the structure of any deal. Instead, St. Paul legislators, led by new mayor Randy Kelly, and aided by Hennepin County legislators wanting to keep their constituents off the hook, played hardball, and amended the ballpark bill so that only cities -- not counties -- could become financial partners in a ballpark. They knew that this move would eliminate both Hennepin County and Minneapolis (by virtue of the $10 million cap on any contribution), and leave only St. Paul as a viable partner. The bill passed, and Ventura signed it, but the strategy backfired. The Twins investigated and quickly rejected St. Paul as an implausible place to build. Nothing came of the bill, and it effectively ended any serious talk of the team moving to St. Paul.\n\nAs 2002 ended, the Twins proclaimed publicly their dissatisfaction with the Rapid Park site. Twins president Dave St. Peter was quoted as saying that the site was \"set off to the side of Downtown, and [has] the garbage incinerator issue.\"\n\nWith the 2003 Minnesota Legislature locked in bitter budget issues, the ballpark was never a central focus. No ballpark bill was passed during the session.\n\nNew governor Tim Pawlenty, who, as a legislator, had been against public spending on stadiums, created the 20-member Stadium Screening Committee to \"solve Minnesota's stadium conundrum.\" The committee was notable primarily for focusing equally on facilities for the Vikings and the Twins. They requested proposals from anyone anywhere with an idea for a stadium, and received 26, some more serious than others. Serious baseball proposals were received from Hennepin County/City of Minneapolis, and the City of St. Paul. The Twins, though they did not either send or endorse a proposal, did premiere a new design and scale model for the committee. Football proposals were received from the cities of Blaine and Eden Prairie. In the end, the recommendations in their final report (issued on February 2, 2004) were so general that they added nothing new to the debate, and the committee was dismissed as being for appearances only.\n\nSeparately, Bruce Lambrecht and Rich Pogin reframed the discussion of their site with a proposal to create \"Twinsville\" as a neighborhood anchored by the new Twins ballpark. Concept drawings showed apartment buildings, commercial buildings and townhouses flanking the ballpark to the north and south, all clustered around a newly daylighted Bassett Creek (which runs in a deep culvert beneath the land). In a nod to Pawlenty's football focus, one provocative drawing included a football stadium to the west (on the current HERC site), sharing a retractable roof with the baseball facility. But this concept also hinted at the possibility that the land might have more valuable uses than as a home for the Twins, an idea which would play a significant role later. Nevertheless, their reframing succeeded in jump-starting interest in the project as plans began to form for bringing about action during the forthcoming 2004 legislative session.\n\nThe year ended with Minneapolis officially authorizing negotiations with Land Partners II (the investment group which owned the Rapid Park site) to gain control of the land.\n\nEarly in 2004 the Twins unveiled a new vision of a stadium which could be built on any site with a footprint of at least four square blocks. Two concept drawings, with and without a retractable roof, were accompanied by a scale model (with roof) which was displayed at TwinsFest in January at the Metrodome. \n\nThe report of Gov. Pawlenty's Stadium Screening Committee set off what the Star-Tribune described as \"bitter financing competition between St. Paul and Hennepin County.\" Though never seriously in the running, St. Paul's efforts effectively sabotaged Hennepin County again. Pawlenty advanced a plan that could build up to three stadiums (Twins, Vikings, and Gophers) albeit with uncertain financing. That uncertainty, combined with dollar amounts now in the billions, and intense partisan bickering over unrelated budget issues, meant that the stadium bill took a back seat and was not passed during the 2004 session.\n\nBehind the scenes in 2004, Hennepin County, led by commissioner Mike Opat, continued negotiations with the Twins, settling on the rough framework for financing which was ultimately used.\n\nAnd the city of Minneapolis, acting on the recommendation of its own advisory committee, worked out an option (assignable to Hennepin County) to purchase the Rapid Park land. They agreed to pay $12.95 million plus 5 acres of adjacent land in exchange for the rights to purchase the 8-acre main ballpark site, effectively agreeing to pay $4.3 million per acre. This agreement expired at the end of 2004 when no stadium bill was passed, but it would play a key role in the later condemnation proceedings.\n\n2005 is remembered as the year that all parties thought a deal could get done, but it never happened.\n\nOn April 26, 2005, Hennepin County and the Twins announced that they had reached a deal on financing. It closely matched what would be the eventual funding solution. In it, the Twins essentially relinquished their desire to put a roof on any new facility, accepting that it was not a financial possibility.\n\nThough the ballpark was a subject of sometimes intense discussion in the 2005 Minnesota Legislative session, it fell victim to a political climate which resulted in a lengthy shutdown of Minnesota government due to a budget impasse. No action was taken in either the regular session or the special session which resolved the budget dispute. Until the very end of the year, proponents held out hope that Pawlenty would call a second special session just for the purpose of dealing with the stadium issue, but he did not.\n\nWith the entire Minnesota Legislature up for reelection in 2006, the session began with no expectation that a ballpark bill could pass. All parties were now committed to both the Hennepin County financing plan and the Rapid Park site, meaning all of the building blocks were in place for a deal, but optimism among the stakeholders was almost impossible to find.\n\nIt took Twins fan and blogger Shane Nackerud to discover that the votes were there. He had long maintained a detailed spreadsheet of legislator statements on the ballpark issue, and was shocked to find, at the beginning of 2006, that the totals ran counter to the conventional wisdom. Both the House and the Senate contained enough \"yes\" votes to make passage possible. He passed his information to Lambrecht and Pogin, who made sure his spreadsheet got the widest possible distribution. This spurred all parties to push hard for the passage of a bill in the 2006 session.\n\nOn April 18, 2006 Hennepin County formally approved a plan to contribute $392 million to a Twins ballpark on the Rapid Park site. The funds would be raised through a county-wide 0.15% sales tax which would also raise funds to support the Hennepin County Libraries and youth sports activities within the county. The plan was exempted from any public referendum.\n\nFinal deliberations in the legislature centered on whether a referendum either was or should be required for any portion of the financing. All sides recognized that such a requirement would kill the project, and thus it became a proxy for deciding whether a ballpark should be built at all.\n\nOn May 20, 2006 the Minnesota Legislature approved a bill authorizing a new Twins ballpark on the Rapid Park site at an initial budgeted cost of $522 million. The cost was to be split between the Minnesota Twins (25%) and Hennepin County (75%). The Twins agreed to a total contribution of $130 million. A public referendum was not required.\n\nOn May 26, 2006, Governor Tim Pawlenty signed the legislation in front of a large crowd at the Metrodome before the start of a Twins game.\n\nSeveral procedural votes were still necessary by the Hennepin County Board, any of which had the potential to derail the project. The final of these was held on August 29, 2006, officially authorizing the imposition of the sales tax, effective January 1, 2007. With the success of this vote, all legislative pieces were in place to formally authorize the ballpark, though acquisition of the Rapid Park land remained.\n\nConstruction of Target Field began on May 21, 2007.\n\nAs work began on the ballpark, a final major snag threatened to derail the entire project for almost a year.\n\nThe bill authorizing the financing of Target Field specified a cap of $90 million for onsite infrastructure costs, which included land acquisition. Surprisingly, even though they were now authorized, Hennepin County did not take any action to acquire the land until very late in 2006.\n\nEventually, it was revealed that the county had budgeted $13.5 million for the land, or about $1.7 million per acre for 8 acres, mistakenly assuming they could acquire it for roughly the dollar amount of the 2004 option agreement between the city of Minneapolis and Land Partners II (the investment group which owned Rapid Park). The dollar amount on that deal had been $12.9 million, though the deal had also included 5 acres of adjacent land. Effectively, it would have paid for only three acres of the 8-acre site that Hennepin County now needed to acquire, at a proposed price of $4.3 million per acre.\n\nIn addition to those numbers being far apart, much had changed since the 2004 deal expired. The Hiawatha Light Rail (later Blue Line) had opened and become a huge success. Funding for the Northstar commuter rail line had been approved. As anticipated, these two lines would eventually converge on the northwest corner of the Rapid Park Site, now the likely location for a future multi-modal transportation hub. The site itself had been rezoned in 2005, allowing its development into high end commercial and residential space. Land Partners II had entered into a development agreement with Hines Corporation for this purpose, as a backup in the event that the land was not chosen as home for the Twins. Given the scarcity of land available in downtown Minneapolis, the land owners had multiple reasons to believe that the land’s value had, in fact, increased substantially since 2004, with or without a ballpark.\n\nStill, Lambrecht and Pogin, now acting as spokesmen for Land Partners II and Hines, had long been on record as “willing sellers” of the land for a ballpark, stipulating only that their investment group would expect “fair market value.” Eventually, they admitted that they fully expected the transaction to take place in eminent domain (condemnation) proceedings, but accepted that inevitability because it would likely result in a fair purchase price, which they had reason to believe would be at least as much as the per-acre amount of the 2004 deal, or $4.3 million per acre (approximately $34 million for the entire 8-acre site), and perhaps significantly more due to market changes.\n\nHennepin County claimed that accepting the price set by an eminent domain judge was not an option for them, due to the infrastructure cap. Any additional money needed for the land would have to come out of some other piece of infrastructure. If the price set by a judge came in over their budget, they would have no funds to pay, and the project could collapse. But eminent domain did offer them the advantage of getting started on construction while working out the details of the land price later.\n\nOn September 19, 2006, Hennepin County officially authorized acquisition of the land, including doing so under eminent domain proceedings, if necessary. In late October the initial county appraisal of the land came in at the same $13.5 million that had been budgeted. Eminent domain proceedings were then initiated on November 1, 2006 as a precaution in case no agreement on land value could be reached by the time construction needed to start. The county set March 1, 2007 as the target date for finalizing acquisition of the Rapid Park site. There had still been no negotiations between the county and the land owners.\n\nAfter months passed without an agreement, a harsh war of words erupted in the media in February 2007. The Twins angrily cancelled a planned unveiling of the ballpark design scheduled for February 15, declaring that the entire project was in jeopardy. Jerry Bell of the Twins and Mike Opat of Hennepin County gave multiple interviews in which they described the land owners as being “unwilling sellers,” “greedy,” “lawyered-up,” painted them as “greedy landowners in black hats,” and as not negotiating in good faith. Lambrecht and Pogin continued to insist that they had an obligation to their investors to secure nothing more than “fair market value” for the land. They repeatedly said that they would accept whatever valuation was determined in eminent domain proceedings, while media reports would later reveal their internal valuation (required by eminent domain laws) to be $65 million.\n\nIn early April 2007 Hennepin County received assurances that the Twins would provide additional funds, if necessary, to cover cost overruns on infrastructure, including the land acquisition. This allowed the initiation of “quick take” proceedings, and the county gained control of the site effective May 1, 2007, with a final sale price to be determined later. This effectively mitigated the problem of the infrastructure cap and allowed the unveiling of the ballpark design on April 12, and construction to begin on May 21, 2007.\n\nDespite the beginning of construction, the land stalemate dragged on for months, as did the harsh rhetoric in the media. Some members of the media and public placed blame on Hennepin County for not securing the land before getting authorization to build the ballpark, while others laid the blame on the sellers for allegedly increasing their price once the legislation passed.\n\nOn August 19, 2007, a three-member condemnation panel set the value of the land at $23.8 million by a vote of 2 to 1. The next day, a separate opinion valuing the land at $33.2 million was filed by the dissenting judge. The landowners immediately announced that they would appeal the condemnation ruling, and a court date was set for November.\n\nTen days later, on August 30, 2007, the ceremonial groundbreaking took place, despite the ongoing land dispute (the event had been scheduled for August 2, but was postponed in the aftermath of the I-35W bridge collapse).\n\nEventually, after exchanging divergent values for several weeks, both parties agreed to mediation, and with the November court date fast approaching, the final agreement was reached on October 12, 2007, with a negotiated price of $29 million. To make the deal possible, the Twins had agreed to make up the $15 million difference between that price and what Hennepin County had originally budgeted. In exchange, they received the right to develop several acres near the ballpark. Land Partners II received property and air rights over Dock Street, which was to be created for access to the ballpark from the north.\n\nWith the establishment of the land value, the final potential obstacle to the completion of Target Field was resolved.\n\nOn September 15, 2008, the Twins and Minneapolis-based Target Corporation announced that the ballpark would be named Target Field. Financial terms of the naming rights agreement were not disclosed. The company's investment also funded a pedestrian bridge from the ballpark to downtown, Target Plaza, more seating, canopies and public art.\n\nDesigned by Populous with Bruce Miller as principal lead, Target Field is a modern take on other Populous-designed stadiums such as Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, PNC Park in Pittsburgh, and AT&T Park in San Francisco.\n\nThe architects tried to avoid creating a replica of the old-style brick Camden Yards or modern urban design of the new Nationals Park (both also designed by Populous). Instead, the design for the stadium employs local limestone, heated viewing areas and a heated field. The stadium does not have a roof, but there is a canopy above the top deck. The stadium is integrated with the intermodal Target Field station which connects the METRO Blue and Green Line light rail service with the Minneapolis terminus of the Northstar commuter rail line leading from the northwest. Walter P Moore served as the structural engineer for the stadium and canopy.\n\nThe stadium does not have a retractable roof, though one was considered initially. Such a roof was cited to add $100 million to the total budget and none of the parties (Twins, Hennepin County or Minnesota Legislature) were willing to pay for that cost. Much like other northern cities with outdoor professional baseball (i.e. Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Cleveland, New York), the weather in Minneapolis during a 162-game baseball season and playoffs can vary from early-spring snow to rain and hot, humid weather. The Metrodome was climate-controlled, and thus, protected the baseball schedule during the entire time that it had been the venue for the Minnesota Twins. However, many Twins fans and baseball purists argue that this same sterile, climate-controlled environment creates a less-than-desirable atmosphere for watching baseball. The architect also tested the feasibility of heated seats.\n\nThe site is about the same size as that of Fenway Park, and the ballpark holds roughly the same number of seats. The site is bounded by 3rd Avenue (southeast, right field, across from Target Center); 5th Street North (northeast, left field); 7th Street North (southwest, first base); Hennepin Environmental Recovery Center [garbage incinerator] and 6th Avenue North (northwest, third base). 3rd Avenue is a westbound one-way street which dips down under the right field seats and serves as a ramp to I-394 westbound. A separate, small westbound segment of 3rd Avenue, connecting 7th Street North with Glenwood Avenue, was renamed \"Twins Way\". The ballpark's street address, \"1 Twins Way\", is at the \"foot\" of the renamed street.\n\nMortenson Construction of Minneapolis built the stadium. Metropolitan Mechanical Contractors completed the mechanical contracting. Danny's Construction Company erected the structural steel. Subcontractors involved in the concrete work include CECO Concrete Construction, Gephart Electric, E&J Rebar, Ambassador Steel Corporation, Amsysco Inc., and Nordic Construction/Cemstone.\n\nThe first concrete slab was poured on December 17, 2007. The concrete portion of construction was completed in November 2008 with a roof deck pour for the Twins administration building. In March 2009 Tekna Kleen (commercial cleaning company), started doing the finishing cleaning touches to Target Field. In late August, 2009, the playing field was installed.\n\nThe Twins received the certificate of occupancy from Mortenson Construction on December 22, 2009. The Twins staff moved in on January 4, 2010.\n\nTarget Field was initially awarded LEED Silver Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council, the second LEED-certified professional sports stadium in the United States, after AT&T Park. It is one of 3 baseball stadiums with LEED certification (the other being Nationals Park). In 2017, Target Field was recertified LEED Gold, the first sports site in the nation to be so designated.\n\nOn February 12, 2008, the Twins announced $22.4 million in upgrades to the original design, and increased the Twins ownership stake in the ballpark to $167.4 million, bringing the total ballpark cost to $412 million. The upgrades were mainly based around increasing fan experience and comfort. The upgrades included an enlarged canopy soffit (the largest in baseball), protecting fans further from the elements, in light of the stadium not having a roof. The Twins also upgraded the scoreboard – the fourth-largest in Major League Baseball – from standard definition to a high definition display from Daktronics measuring long and high. Other upgrades included warming shelters, changing of the exterior surface to Kasota stone, and increasing the number of restrooms and concession areas. The park features a modernized version of the original \"Minnie and Paul Shaking Hands\" logo used on the team's original uniforms from 1961 until 1986 (the logo has also been on the home uniforms since 2001). When a Twins player hits a home run, the Minnie and Paul sign lights up with strobe lights surrounding the Minnesota state outline and Minnie and Paul shake hands, akin to the Liberty Bell used at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. The original flagpole from Metropolitan Stadium – completely restored – is located on the right field plaza. The flagpole was located at the American Legion post in Richfield after Metropolitan Stadium's closing, and was donated back to the Twins by the Legion as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, the Twins announced a number of upgrades to Target Field, all of which were completed in time for the 2011 season. Highlights among the upgrades included a scoreboard in right-center field and the \"Twins Tower\" (a tall illuminated tower), next to the new scoreboard. Other changes include free Wi-Fi service for fans, expanded concession stand menus, and the addition of more radiant heaters and artwork around the ballpark. In total, the changes were expected to cost the Twins $4–6 million.\n\nAdditionally, the 14 black spruce trees located in the batter's eye were removed, following hitters' complaints that the trees interfered with the ability to see pitches as they would sometimes sway in the wind. The batter's eye wall itself was covered in a black material designed to reduce glare.\n\nStarting in 2013, Target Field has hosted every summer the Skyline Music Festival, named so because its seating, with only the seats around third base in an Amphitheatre-like manner, allows for extensive views of the Minneapolis skyline. The inaugural edition was held on July 26, 2013, featuring three of four bands in a package tour – Soul Asylum, Matthew Sweet and Big Head Todd and the Monsters, each of whom played one of their past albums in their entirety – along with Minnesota band Gear Daddies. The 6,752 tickets allowed by the section were sold out. The following edition was extended to two nights. August 8 featured an indie rock night sponsored by KCMP, featuring Andrew Bird, The New Pornographers, Thao and the Get Down Stay Down, S. Carey and Dosh. The following night was headlined by Melissa Etheridge, accompanied by the returning Gear Daddies, along with The Honeydogs, O.A.R. and The Rembrandts. Attendance was 2,500 for the first night and 5,500 for the second.\n\n\nTarget Plaza is the gathering area behind the right field gate (Gate 34). On the wall of the adjacent parking garage facing the ballpark is a wind veil that makes waves as the wind blows. At night, color-changing lights add to the effect. Near the wind veil there are 9 topiary frames each high shaped like baseball bats with hops growing on them. They are lit up every night with the same color changing scheme as the veil, however, during games they are lit up red, in sequential order, to denote the current inning. In this plaza are statues of former players Kirby Puckett, Rod Carew, Kent Hrbek and Harmon Killebrew, as well as former owners Calvin Griffith, Carl Pohlad and his wife, Eloise Pohlad and Twins mascot TC Bear. \n\nA large \"Golden Glove\" sits in the plaza in recognition of all Twins players to win the Gold Glove Award. The statue can be sat on and is a popular photo attraction. It is located exactly from home plate, the distance of Harmon Killebrew's longest home run at Met Stadium (although his was hit into the left field upper deck).\n\nThere is also a monument that shows all the venues that Minnesota-based baseball teams played in. On the rails of the pedestrian skybridge are pennants that contain the rosters of all the Twins teams, and pennants of players, coaches, front office people, and other contributors who have been elected to the Twins Hall of Fame.\n\nThe main flagpoles are in right field near the Plaza. The largest pole, which flies the Stars and Stripes, is the original pole used at Metropolitan Stadium. It was relocated to the Richfield Legion Post 435 after the Met was demolished, and, after being cut in half and refurbished, was re-installed for baseball at Target Field. The first flags--both US and POW/MIA--donated by Post 435 were raised at the first Twins exhibition game by veteran and flagpole historian B.W. McEvers of Bloomington. On September 6, Jim Thome hit a solo home run against the Kansas City Royals that hit the flag pole. \n\nThe championship banners fly on small flagpoles located on the upper rim of the stadium beyond left field. Each pole recognizes each division, league, and world championship since the team's arrival in . On the stadium's upper rim in right-center field are small flagpoles that fly the flag for all the teams (including the Twins) in the division. The order that the flags fly are determined by the divisional standings. \n\nHome plate is the same one used at the Metrodome. After the Twins' final dome game (Game 3 of the 2009 ALDS), the plate was dug up and later installed at Target Field. In addition, several handfuls of dirt were taken from the sliding pit and pitcher's mound areas from the Metrodome and scattered near their counterparts at Target Field.\n\nAt Target Field, there are three prominent bars and restaurants:\n\n\nConcessions throughout also include several Minnesota favorites like walleye, wild rice soup, Kramarczuk's sausages, as well as a \"State Fair Foods\" stand where many items are served \"on a stick\", such as the J.D. Hoyt's pork chop.\n\nIn 2018, PETA declared Target Field number one on its annual list of vegan-friendly ballparks, thanks to the availability of foods like tofu vindaloo, vegan Sriracha Brats and Italian Sausages, Daiya cheese pizza, and Field Roast burgers and dogs.\n\nA large version of the Twins' original \"Minnie and Paul\" logo (designed by local artist, Ray Barton ) stands in center field. It shows two players wearing the uniforms of the two minor-league teams that played in the Twin Cities before the Twins' arrival, the Minneapolis Millers and St. Paul Saints, shaking hands across the Mississippi River. During various points in the game, the strobe lights surrounding the logo flash. This sign was a concept designed and illustrated by RipBang Studios but built by others.\n\nWhen the Twins score a run by any means other than a home run, the strobe lights trace the border from the bottom-left corner for each Twins player that crosses home plate, symbolizing that a Twins player rounded the bases. For each strikeout, the corners of the sign flash to portray the strike zone. The strobe lights will flash at the end of the top of an inning if the Twins do not surrender a run during the inning. After a Twins home run, the strobe lights flash, Minnie and Paul shake hands, and the Mississippi River flows. After a Twins victory, the \"T\" and \"s\" in \"Twins\" will blink to show the message \"Twins win\" in addition to the animation shown following a Twins home run.\n\nThe stadium is well-connected to the city's transit network, being immediately adjacent to the \"A\" and \"B\" parking ramps of the large ABC Ramps complex at the end of Interstate 394, which include two major transit bus terminals and link to the rest of downtown Minneapolis via skyway. Over 8,000 people typically arrive to each game via the METRO Blue Line and METRO Green Line, both of which terminate at Target Field Station, just 10 yards from the park's Gate 6. For fans arriving from the northwest suburbs, the Northstar Line commuter rail terminates in downtown Minneapolis with a station underneath the ballpark.\n\nThe first \"soft event\" at Target Field was an open house held for season ticket holders on March 20 and 21, 2010.\nThe first baseball game at the new ballpark took place on March 27, 2010, with a college baseball game between the University of Minnesota and Louisiana Tech attended by 37,757 fans.\n\nThe Twins played two preseason games against the St. Louis Cardinals on April 2 and 3, while the stadium's inaugural regular season game was on April 12, against the Red Sox.\n\nField dimensions are roughly comparable, with the left field area being a few feet closer to the plate, and the center field area being bounded by a 45° facet instead of a quarter-circle.\n\nThe Twins' previous homes in the Twin Cities, Metropolitan Stadium and the Metrodome, were friendly to hitters. The team intended to build Target Field as a \"neutral\" park, favoring neither hitters nor pitchers. However, following the 2010 regular season, statistics showed that the park definitely played more to the favor of pitchers than hitters. It has since become well known as a \"pitcher's park\" in that it is difficult for batters to hit home runs and the pitcher has an advantage. Twins star Justin Morneau spoke for many of the players' concerns by calling \"right-center to left-center... ridiculous\" and that it is \"almost impossible for a right-handed hitter to [homer to the] opposite field and very difficult for lefties\".\n\n\n"}
