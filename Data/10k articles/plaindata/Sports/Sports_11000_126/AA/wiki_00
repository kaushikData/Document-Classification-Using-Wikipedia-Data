{"id": "145263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145263", "title": "Air gun", "text": "Air gun\n\nAn air gun (or airgun) is any kind of gun that launches projectiles pneumatically with compressed air or other gases that are pressurized \"mechanically\" without involving any chemical reactions, in contrast to a firearm, which pressurizes gases \"chemically\" via an exothermic oxidation (deflagration) of combustible propellants which generates propulsive energy by breaking molecular bonds. Both the long gun and handgun forms (air rifle and air pistol) typically propel metallic projectiles, that are either diabolo-shaped pellets, or spherical shots called BBs. Certain types of air guns (usually rifles) may also propel darts or arrows.\n\nThe first air guns were developed as early as the 1500s. They have been used in hunting, sporting and warfare. Modern air guns use one of three types of power source depending on the design: spring-piston, pneumatic, and bottled compressed gas (most commonly carbon dioxide).\n\nAir guns represent the oldest pneumatic technology. The oldest existing mechanical air gun, a bellows air gun dating back to about 1580, is in the Livrustkammaren Museum in Stockholm. This is the time most historians recognize as the beginning of the modern air gun.\n\nThroughout 17th to 19th century, air guns in calibers .30–.51, were used to hunt big-game deer and wild boar. These air rifles were charged using a pump to fill an air reservoir and gave velocities from . They were also used in warfare, the most recognized example being the Girandoni air rifle.\n\nAt that time, they had compelling advantages over the primitive firearms of the day. For example, air guns could be discharged in wet weather and rain (unlike both matchlock and flintlock muskets), and discharged much faster than muzzle-loading guns. Moreover, they were quieter than a firearm of similar caliber, had no muzzle flash, and were smokeless. Thus, they did not disclose the shooter's position or obscure the shooter's view, unlike the black powder muskets of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nIn the hands of skilled soldiers, they gave the military a distinct advantage. France, Austria and other nations had special sniper detachments using air rifles. The Austrian 1770 model was named \"Windbüchse\" (literally \"wind rifle\" in German). The gun was developed in 1768 or 1769 by the Tyrolean watchmaker, mechanic and gunsmith Bartholomäus Girandoni (1744–1799) and is sometimes referred to as the Girandoni air rifle or Girandoni air gun in literature (the name is also spelled \"Girandony,\" \"Giradoni\" or \"Girardoni\".) The \"Windbüchse\" was about 4 ft (1.2 m) long and weighed 10 pounds (4.5 kg), about the same size and mass as a conventional musket. The air reservoir was a removable, club-shaped, butt. The \"Windbüchse\" carried twenty-two .51 caliber (13 mm) lead balls in a tubular magazine. A skilled shooter could fire off one magazine in about thirty seconds. A shot from this air gun could penetrate an inch thick wooden board at a hundred paces, an effect roughly equal to that of a modern 9×19mm or .45 ACP caliber pistol.\n\nCirca 1820, the Japanese inventor Kunitomo Ikkansai developed various manufacturing methods for guns, and also created an air gun based on the study of Western knowledge (\"rangaku\") acquired from the Dutch in Dejima.\nThe celebrated Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804) carried a reservoir air gun. It held 22 .46 caliber round balls in a tubular magazine mounted on the side of the barrel. The butt served as the air reservoir and had a working pressure of . The rifle was said to be capable of 22 aimed shots per minute and had a rifled bore of and a groove diameter .\n\nOne of the first commercially successful and mass-produced air guns was manufactured by the William F. Markham's Markham Air Rifle Company in Plymouth, Michigan. Their first model air gun was the wooden \"Challenger\" and marketed in 1886. In response, Clarence Hamilton from the neighboring Plymouth Air Rifle Company (later renamed to Daisy Manufacturing Company in 1895) marketed their all-metal Daisy BB Gun in early 1888, which prompted Markham to respond with their \"Chicago\" model in 1888 followed by the \"King\" model in 1890. The \"Chicago\" model was sold by Sears, Roebuck for 73 cents in its catalog. In 1928 the name of the Markham company was changed to King Air Rifle Company after the company was purchased by Daisy in 1916 after decades of intense competition, and continued to manufacture the \"King\" model air rifle until 1935 before ceasing operation all together in the 1940s.\n\nDuring the 1890s, air rifles were used in Birmingham, England, for competitive target shooting. Matches were held in public houses, which sponsored shooting teams. Prizes, such as a leg of mutton for the winning team, were paid for by the losing team. The sport became so popular that in 1899, the National Smallbore Rifle Association was created. During this time over 4,000 air rifle clubs and associations existed across Great Britain, many of them in Birmingham. During this time, the air gun was associated with poaching because it could deliver a shot without a significant report.\n\nIn terms of power modern air guns are capable of delivering high levels of energy, the recently showcased Umarex Hammer fires a .50 caliber air bullet delivering over 700 ft lbs of energy (950 Joules).\n\nAir guns are used for hunting, pest control, recreational shooting (commonly known as plinking), and competitive sports, such as the Olympic 10 m Air Rifle and 10 m Air Pistol events. Field Target (FT) is a competitive form of target shooting in which the targets are knock-down metal silhouettes of animals, with a 'kill zone' cut out of the steel plate. Hunter Field Target (HFT) is a variation, using identical equipment, but with differing rules. The distances FT and HFT competitions are shot at range between for HFT & for FT, with varying sizes of 'reducers' being used to increase or decrease the size of the kill zone. In the UK, competition power limits are set at the legal maximum for an unlicensed air rifle, i.e. .\n\nThe increasing affordability of higher-power PCP rifles has allowed large projectiles and further target distance for competition purposes. For instance, the Extreme Benchrest competition held annually in Green Valley, Arizona allows calibers up to and targets at , while the Big Bore Benchrest arm of the same competition engages targets at .\n\nThe different methods of powering an air gun can be broadly divided into three groups: spring-piston, pneumatic, and compressed CO. These methods are used in both air rifles and air pistols.\n\nSpring-piston air guns (or simply \"spring guns\" or \"springers\") operate by means of a coil spring-loaded piston pump assembly contained within a compression chamber separate from the gun barrel. Before shooting, the user need to manually cock the gun by flexing a lever connected to the pump assembly. The cocking drives the pump piston backwards and compress the spring until its rear engages the sear. The act of pulling the trigger disengages the sear, allows the spring to decompress and release the elastic potential energy stored within it, and pushes the piston forward thereby compressing the air in the pump cylinder. Because the pump outlet (located to the front of the pump) is directly behind the pellet sitting in the barrel chamber, once the air pressure has risen enough to overcome any static friction and/or barrel restriction holding back the pellet, the pellet is propelled forward by an expanding column of pressurized air. All this takes place in a fraction of a second, during which the air undergoes adiabatic heating to several hundred degrees and then cools as the air expands. This can also cause a phenomenon referred as \"dieseling\", where flammable substances in the compression chamber (e.g. petroleum-based lubricant) can be ignited by the compression heat like in a diesel engine, and lead to an afterburner effect with (often unpredictable) additional thrusts, as well as combustion smoke coming out of the muzzle upon firing. Most spring-piston guns are single-shot breechloaders by nature, but multiple-shot repeaters with magazine feeders have become more common in recent years.\n\nSpring-piston guns, especially the high-powered \"magnum\" guns, are able to achieve muzzle velocities near or exceeding the speed of sound. The effort required for the cocking stroke is usually related to the designed power of the gun, with higher muzzle velocities requiring a stiffer spring and hence a greater cocking effort. Spring-piston guns have a practical upper limit of for .177 cal (4.5 mm) pellets, as higher velocities cause unstable pellet flight and loss of accuracy. This is due to the extreme buffeting caused when the pellet reaches and surpasses transonic speed, then slows back down and goes through sound barrier again, which is more than enough to destabilize the pellet's flight. Shortly after leaving the barrel, the supersonic pellet falls back below the speed of sound and the shock wave overtakes the pellet, causing its flight stability to be disrupted. Drag increases rapidly as pellets are pushed past the speed of sound, so it is generally better to increase pellet weight to keep velocities subsonic in high-powered guns. Sonic crack from the pellet as it moves with supersonic speed also makes the shot louder sometimes making it possible to be mistaken for firearm discharge. Many shooters have found that velocities in the range offer an ideal balance between power and pellet stability.\n\nSpring guns are typically cocked by one of the following mechanisms:\n\nSpring-piston guns, especially high-powered (\"magnum\") models, do still recoil as a result of the forward motion of the piston. Although the recoil is less than that of some cartridge firearms, it can make the gun difficult to shoot accurately as the recoil forces are in effect whilst the pellet is still within the barrel. Spring gun recoil also has a sharp forward component, caused by the piston hitting the front end of the pump chamber when the spring has fully decompressed. These two rapid jerking movements are known to damage scopes not rated for spring gun usage. In addition, the spring vibrations are often unpredictable and can also cause accuracy to suffer. These vibrations can be controlled by adding features like close-fitting spring guides or by aftermarket tuning done by \"airgunsmiths\" who specialize in air gun modifications, a common one being the addition of viscous silicone grease to the spring, which both lubricates it and dampens vibration. Some shooters also often hold the gun in a very loose grip (the \"artillery hold\" as coined by famous American airgunner Tom Gaylord) that allows the gun to vibrate in a natural and consistent manner. There are also newer models with a floating receiver design that allows the action to slide over the stock autonomously, thus making the gun less hold-sensitive.\n\nThe better quality spring guns can have very long service lives, being simple to maintain and repair. Because they deliver the same mechanical energy output on each shot, the external ballistic is quite consistent. Most Olympic air gun competitions through the 1970s and into the 1980s were shot with spring-piston guns, often of the opposing-piston recoil-eliminating type. Beginning in the 1980s, guns powered by compressed/liquefied carbon dioxide began to dominate the competition. Today, the guns used at the highest levels of competition are powered by compressed air.\n\nSome makes of air guns incorporate a gas spring (commonly referred to as a \"gas piston\", \"gas ram\", \"gas strut\" or \"nitro piston\") instead of a mechanical coil spring. The spring itself is essentially a stand-alone enclosed piston pump without outlet and with pressurized air or inert gas (such as nitrogen) held tightly sealed within the cylinder. When the gun is cocked, the gas inside the cylinder gets further compressed by the piston, stores potential energy and acts in effect as a pneumatic accumulator. Gas spring units require higher precision to manufacture, since they require a low-friction sliding seal that can withstand the high pressures when cocked. The advantages of the gas spring include the ability to keep the gun cocked and ready to fire for extended periods of time without long-term spring fatigue, smoother recoil pattern and lower vibration, and faster \"lock time\" (the time between pulling the trigger and the pellet being discharged) which results in better accuracy. Gas spring air guns are also usually less \"hold-sensitive\" and hence easier to achieve consistent shot groupings.\n\nPneumatic air guns propel the projectiles by utilizing the pneumatic potential energy within compressed air, which is pressurized beforehand and stored inside the gun, and then released through valves during shooting. Single-stroke and multi-stroke pump guns utilize an on-board pump to pressurize air in an internal reservoir, while pre-charged pneumatic guns' reservoirs are filled from an external source using either a high-pressure hand pump or by decanting air from a diving cylinder. \n\nPump pneumatic air guns, or pump guns, use a lever-operated onboard air pump to pressurize an internal reservoir, which then discharge the stored compressed air during shooting. Depend on the design, pump guns can be either single-stroke or multi-stroke.\n\n\n\nPre-charged pneumatic (PCP) air guns have their internal reservoir pre-filled from an external air source (such as a diving cylinder, or by charging with a hand pump), and remains pressurized until depleted after repeated shooting. During shooting, the hammer strikes the reservior's release valve, allowing a set volume of the pressurized air to be discharged into the chamber and propel the projectile. Depending on the release valve design, PCP air guns can be categorized into two types — \"unregulated\" and \"regulated\" (which has either a mechanical or electronic regulator valve). Because of the need for cylinders or charging systems, PCP guns have higher initial costs but much lower operating costs when compared to CO rifles, and have superior performance over ordinary pump guns. Having no significant movement of heavy mechanical parts during the discharge cycle, PCP airgun designs produce lower recoil, and can shoot as many as 100 shots per charge depending on the tank/reservoir size.\n\nThe ready supply of air has allowed the development of semi- and fully automatic air guns. PCP guns are very popular in the UK and Europe because of their accuracy and ease of use. They are widely utilized in ISSF 10 metre air pistol and rifle shooting events, the sport of Field Target shooting, and are usually fitted with telescopic sights.\n\nEarly hand-pump designs encountered problems of fatigue (both human and mechanical), temperature warping, and condensation — none of which are beneficial to accurate shooting or the airguns' longevity. Modern hand pumps have built-in air filtration systems and have overcome many of these problems. Using scuba-quality air decanted from a scuba cylinder provides consistently clean, dry, high-pressure air.\n\nDuring the typical PCP's discharge cycle, the hammer of the rifle is released by the sear to strike the bash valve. The hammer may move rearwards or forwards, unlike firearms where the hammer almost always moves forward. The valve is held closed by a spring and the pressure of the air in the reservoir. The pressure of the spring is constant, and the pressure of the air released (which is also known as the \"working pressure\") decreases with each successive shot. As a result, when the reservoir pressure is high, the valve opens less fully and closes faster than when the reservoir pressure is lower, resulting in a similar total volume of air flowing past the valve with each shot. This results in a degree of partial self-regulation that gives a greater consistency of velocity from shot to shot, which corresponds to the middle \"plateau\" phase of the gun's shot-to-shot muzzle velocity profile (also known as the \"power curve\" ). A well-designed PCP will display good shot-to-shot consistency over longer period as the air reservoir is being depleted.\n\nOther PCP rifles and pistols are regulated, i.e. the firing valve operates within a secondary chamber separated from the main air reservoir by the regulator body. The regulator maintains the pressure within this secondary chamber at a set pressure (lower than the main reservoir's) until the main reservoir's pressure drops to the point where it can no longer do so. As a result, shot-to-shot consistency is maintained for longer than in an unregulated rifle, and the gun can also output more shots due to reduced waste of reservoir pressure.\n\nOriginally called \"CG guns\" (compressed gas guns), air guns utilizing prefilled removable gas cylinders as power source have now become known as \"CO guns\" due to the ubiquitous commercial use of bottled carbon dioxide gas. Most CO guns use a disposable cylinder called a \"Powerlet\", that is often purchased with of pressurized CO gas, although some, usually more expensive models, use larger refillable CO reservoirs like those typically used with paintball markers.\n\nCO guns, like other pneumatic guns using compressed air, offer power for repeated shots in a compact package without the need for complex cocking or filling mechanisms. The ability to store power for repeated shots also means that repeating arms are possible. There are many replica revolvers and semi-automatic pistols on the market that use CO power. These guns are popular for training, as the guns and ammunition are inexpensive, relatively safe to use, and no specialized facilities are needed for safety. In addition, they can be purchased and owned in areas where firearms possession is either strictly controlled or banned outright. Most CO powered guns are relatively inexpensive, and there are a few precision target guns available that use CO.\n\nThe most popular ammunition used in rifled air guns is the wasp-waisted diabolo pellet, which has two sections — a solid front portion called the \"head\", which contains the center of mass and is available in a variety of shapes and styles such as flat (wadcutter), round (domed), cone-shaped (pointed) and pitted (hollow point); and a hollowed, thin-walled rear portion called the \"skirt\", which expands and fully engages the bore to provide a good seal, thus allows maximal efficiency in pellet propulsion during shooting. In flight, the skirt has greater drag-to-weight ratio than the head, and provides drag-stabilization similar to that of a shuttlecock. This shape design also means that the overall pellet will have poor ballistic coefficient and tends to be more unstable than some other projectile shapes, especially in the transonic region (272–408 m/s ~ 893–1340 ft/s). Diabolo pellets are traditionally made from lead, but can also be manufactured from tin, or a combination of materials such as steel or gold alloys with polymer tips.\n\nSome manufacturers also have recently introduced the more cylindrical-shaped \"slug\" pellets for the more powerful modern PCP air rifles. Compared to the commonly used diabolo pellets, these slug pellets resemble Minié balls and have more contact surface with the bore and hence needs greater propelling force to overcome friction, but have better aerodynamics and longer effective ranges due to the more similar shape to firearm bullets, however also require a fully rifled barrel for spin stabilization in flight.\n\nThe BB was once the most common airgun ammunition in the USA, thanks to the popularity of Daisy’s line of BB airguns. A BB is a small metallic ball, typically made of steel (with a copper or zinc coating) or lead, in 4.5 mm/.177\" diameter. Originally called the “round shot”, the contemporary name came from the “BB”- size lead birdshot used in shotguns, which the first BB gun invented in 1886 was designed to shoot. Steel BBs can be acceptably accurate at short distances when fired from properly designed BB guns with smoothbore barrels. Lead number 3 buckshot pellets can be used in .25\" caliber airguns as if they were large BBs.\n\nDue to the hardness of the steel, they can not \"take\" to rifled barrels, which is why they are undersized (4.4 against 4.5 mm) to allow them to be used in .177\" rifled barrels, which when used in this configuration can in effect be considered smoothbore, but with a poorer gas-seal. Were they 4.5 mm diameter, they would jam in the bore. Therefore, BB's lack the spin stabilization required for long-range accuracy, and usage in any but the cheapest rifled guns is discouraged.\n\nTypically BBs are used for indoor practice, casual outdoor plinking, training children, or for air gun enthusiasts who like to practice, but cannot afford high-powered air gun systems that use pellets. Some shotgunners use sightless BB rifles to train in instinctive shooting. Similar guns were also used briefly by the United States Army in a Vietnam-era instinctive shooting program called \"Quick Kill\".\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries air gun darts were popular, largely because they could be reused. Although less popular now, several different types of darts are made to be used in air guns. But it is not recommended that darts be used in air guns with rifled bores or in spring-powered air guns. Air guns that shoot darts are sometimes called \"dart guns\", and \"tranquilizer guns\" if the darts used are loaded with anesthetic (tranquilizer) compounds.\n\nSome modern air guns are designed to discharge arrows and are called \"arrow guns\" or sometimes \"airbows\". These arrows are designed with a hollow shaft that is open in the rear where the nock would normally be. When loaded, the hollow arrow shaft is slid rearwards over a barrel whose external diameter is only fractionally smaller than the shaft's interior diameter, providing a close enough fitting that minimizes rattling and gives reasonable enveloping seal without causing too much friction. During shooting, the trigger releases high-pressure air from the barrel to the front portion of the hollow arrow shaft, pushing the arrow forward. Such air guns can shoot arrows at launch velocities rivalling or even exceeding high-end crossbows, while retaining consistency of precision unaffected by archer's paradox, but they are also more expensive to setup and maintain.\n\nThe most common air gun calibers are\n\nOther less common traditional calibers include:\n\nLarger caliber air rifles suitable for hunting large animals are offered by major manufacturers. These are usually PCP guns. The major calibers available are:\n\nCustom air guns are available in even larger calibers such as 20 mm (0.79\") or .87 (22.1 mm).\n\nWhile in some countries air guns are not subject to any specific regulation, in most there are laws, which differ widely. Each jurisdiction has its own definition of an air gun; and regulations may vary for weapons of different bore, muzzle energy or velocity, or material of ammunition, with guns designed to fire metal pellets often more tightly controlled than airsoft weapons. There may be minimum ages for possession, and sales of both air guns and ammunition may be restricted. Some areas require permits and background checks similar to those required for proper firearms.\n\nWhile historical air guns have been made specifically for warfare, modern air guns can also be deadly. In medical literature, modern air guns have been noted as a cause of death. This has been the case for guns of caliber .177 and .22 that are within the legal muzzle energy of air guns in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n"}

This originated in the American Football League in the 1960s, one of whose earliest experts was Willie Brown of the Oakland Raiders. Mel Blount of the Pittsburgh Steelers specialized in this coverage to such a point as to cause a rule change (see below) to make it easier for receivers to run their routes and increase scoring. \n\nThis play works well against routes that require the receiver to be in a certain spot at a certain time.

{"id": "37376866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37376866", "title": "Foxcatcher", "text": "Foxcatcher\n\nFoxcatcher is a 2014 American biographical sports true crime drama film produced and directed by Bennett Miller. Written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman, the film stars Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffalo. The film's plot is loosely based on the events surrounding multimillionaire E.I. du Pont family heir and wrestling enthusiast John du Pont's 1986 recruitment of two 1984 U.S. Olympic gold medalist wrestlers, Mark Schultz and his older brother David, to help coach U.S. wrestlers for participation in national, world, and Olympic competition, and the subsequent murder of David by John du Pont in January 1996.\n\n\"Foxcatcher\" received critical acclaim for the three lead actors' performances, Miller's direction, and the film's visual style and tone. It was nominated for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where Miller won the Best Director Award. The film had three Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Picture. The film was nominated for five Oscars at the 2015 Academy Awards, including a Best Actor nomination for Carell, Best Supporting Actor for Ruffalo and Best Director for Miller. It became the first film to be nominated for Best Director but not Best Picture since 2008, when Julian Schnabel was nominated for \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\", two years before the Academy extended its maximum number of Best Picture nominees to 10 films.\n\nOlympic wrestling champion Mark Schultz speaks at an elementary school in place of his older brother, Dave. Both are Olympic gold medal winners, but Mark feels overshadowed by Dave. Mark is contacted by philanthropist and wrestling enthusiast John E. du Pont, an heir to the E.I. du Pont family fortune, who arranges to fly Mark to his estate in Pennsylvania where du Pont has built a private wrestling training facility. Du Pont invites Mark to join his wrestling team, Team Foxcatcher, to be paid to train for the World Championship. Mark accepts the offer, with du Pont urging him to enlist Dave as well. Dave declines for the sake of his wife and two children, who are settled where they live, so Mark moves to Pennsylvania alone.\n\nMark stays in a homey guest house (\"The Chalet\") and is greeted there later in the night by du Pont. Through training with his new teammates and du Pont's financial support, Mark excels with Foxcatcher, winning a Gold Medal at the 1987 World Wrestling Championships. Du Pont praises him, and they develop a friendship. Du Pont introduces Mark to cocaine, which he starts to use regularly. He confides in Mark, whom he now calls a true friend, telling him how his mother, Jean du Pont, paid a boy to act as his friend. Jean tells her son that she believes wrestling is a \"low sport\" and does not like seeing him \"being low\". One day, Mark and his teammates in Foxcatcher take the morning off from training to watch mixed martial arts (MMA) on TV. Angered by this (as well as Mark's insistence that his brother will not join Team Foxcatcher), du Pont verbally and physically rebuffs him, saying that he will enlist Dave by any means necessary while also demanding that Mark work out his differences with his brother as soon as possible.\n\nDave decides to move with his family to Pennsylvania so he can join Foxcatcher. His self-esteem damaged by du Pont, Mark decides to work and train alone, pushing away both du Pont and even Dave. As Team Foxcatcher prepares to enter the preliminaries for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, du Pont's mother is escorted into du Pont's gym to watch him coach his team. He awkwardly demonstrates basic maneuvers for her and the other wrestlers. Jean leaves in disgust after seeing du Pont give his back to his student.\n\nAt the 1988 Olympic Trials in Pensacola, Florida, Mark performs poorly, losing his first match. Angered by his failure, Mark destroys his room, cries and goes on an eating binge. Dave manages to break into his room and is alarmed at his brother's condition. They work feverishly so Mark can make his weight class. As Mark exercises, Dave prevents du Pont from speaking with Mark. Mark competes well enough to win his match and make the Olympic team. Dave notices that du Pont is absent, learning that he left for Pennsylvania after being told his mother died. After returning to the estate, Mark tells Dave that \"you and I both know that I can't stay\" at Foxcatcher once the Olympics are over and asks Dave to leave with him. A documentary funded by du Pont about his exploits with Team Foxcatcher is made, during which Dave is asked to praise him as coach and mentor. Mark loses his matches in Seoul, after which he leaves Team Foxcatcher. While Dave continues to live at du Pont's estate and train with Foxcatcher, as a condition for his remaining he negotiates an arrangement with du Pont to continue to support Mark financially.\n\nLater, du Pont is seen sitting alone in his mansion's trophy room watching the documentary about Team Foxcatcher, which ends with Mark complimenting du Pont at a ceremony depicted earlier. Du Pont calls his bodyguard and drives to Dave's home, where he finds him in the driveway working on his car radio. As Schultz approaches du Pont's car to greet him, du Pont rolls down his window, asks Dave \"Do you have a problem with me?,\" and shoots him three times at close range. Dave's wife, Nancy, calls 9-1-1; and, as du Pont drives off, she runs outside to her husband, who dies in her arms. Du Pont is later arrested outside his own home, and the film ends showing Mark as he competes in a cage fighting match with the crowd's cheers ringing in his head.\n\nBennett Miller began developing the project in 2010 after acquiring the rights to the story from Michael Coleman and Tom Heller. Megan Ellison financed the film through her Annapurna Pictures, also producing alongside Miller, Jon Kilik, and Anthony Bregman. Sony Pictures Classics became the distributor, taking over from Sony's Columbia Pictures, which had co-financed the film. Miller said \"it's always been my hope and expectation that they (SPC) would distribute the film.\" Gary Oldman was first choice for the role of John E. du Pont, but he turned down the role due to his commitment to \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\".\nShooting began in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area on October 15, 2012, in and near the suburbs of Sewickley, Pennsylvania, Sewickley Heights, and Edgeworth. With du Pont's mansion, Liseter Hall, having been demolished in January 2013, the filmmakers used Morven Park, a historic estate in Leesburg, Virginia with a similar facade, for exterior filming. An 1899 mansion, Wilpen Hall, in the wealthy Pittsburgh suburb of Sewickley Heights, Pennsylvania, served as Foxcatcher's stand-in for the interior filming location for du Pont's Philadelphia-area estate. Filming also took place in the Pittsburgh area communities of Rector (Ligonier Township), McKeesport, White Oak, and Connoquenessing. The production sought permission to film in West Mifflin Middle School in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. In December 2012, filming took place in Washington, Pennsylvania, Trinity High School, the Petersen Events Center in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Oakland, and the California University of Pennsylvania Convocation Center. Filming was scheduled to last through January 2013.\n\nThe scene where the Foxcatcher team watches mixed martial arts on television in 1988 uses footage from Gary Goodridge's win over Paul Herrera at UFC 8, from February 1996. At UFC 9 that March, Mark Schultz made his MMA debut, defeating Goodridge. In the film, he is depicted facing a fictional opponent. Channing Tatum stated that the role was \"the hardest acting challenge I've had to date.\"\n\nA release date for \"Foxcatcher\" was originally set for December 20, 2013. The date was postponed to allow for more time to complete the film, according to Sony Pictures Classics. The film debuted at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival in May 2014, in competition for the Palme d'Or, the festival's highest prize, where director Bennett Miller won the Award for Best Director. The film made its way through the late-2014 festival circuit, appearing at the Telluride, Toronto, New York, Vancouver and London film festivals. \"Foxcatcher\" received a limited release on November 14, 2014. The film opened across U.S. theaters through December 2014 and January 2015. The film was released on Blu-Ray and DVD March 3, 2015.\n\nThe film was given a limited release in North America on November 14, 2014, grossing $270,877 from 6 theaters, an average of $45,146 per theater. The film had its wide release on January 16, 2015, opening in 759 theaters and grossing $980,000, finishing 20th at the box office. Overall, \"Foxcatcher\" grossed $12.1 million in North America and $7.1 million in other territories for a total gross of $19.2 million, against its $24 million budget.\n\n\"Foxcatcher\" received critical acclaim, with many praising the performances of Carell, Tatum, and Ruffalo. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 88%, based on 232 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus states, \"A chilling true crime drama, \"Foxcatcher\" offers Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum a chance to shine—and all three rise to the challenge.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nJustin Chang of \"Variety\" praised the film, writing: \"Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum give superb performances in Bennett Miller's powerfully disturbing true-crime saga.\" Eric Kohn of \"Indiewire\" also reacted positively, with most of his praise going towards Carell's and Tatum's performances. Donald Clarke of \"The Irish Times\" praised Miller's direction, saying that \"he [Miller] hits his stride with a stunning portrayal of psychopathy and moral decadence in the unlikely environment of Olympic wrestling.\" Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised Carell's performance, calling it \"career changing.\" Budd Wilkins of \"Slant Magazine\", however, gave the film a negative review, writing that it \"offers us next to nothing of utility or complexity about du Pont's pathology.\"\n\nMark Schultz's reaction to the movie has been varied due to the intensely personal subject matter. He supported the film in general throughout its creation and served as a consultant. At one point he became angry and criticized Bennett Miller after critics pointed out \"homosexual undertones\" in the portrayal of the relationship between Mark Schultz and du Pont. Schultz then demanded Miller address the issue \"or I will.\" Schultz said that \"\"Foxcatcher\"s scenes are mostly straight out of my book (except a few). But the relationships and personalities are complete fiction.\" Several weeks after these statements, Schultz recanted criticisms of the movie, saying \"\"Foxcatcher\" is a miracle. I'm sorry I said I hated it. I love it,\" and apologized to Miller.\n\nFollowing Dave Schultz's death, his widow, Nancy, and their two children moved to northern California, where they still reside. In June 1997, Schultz was posthumously inducted into the U.S. National Wrestling Hall of Fame. Mark Schultz stopped wrestling competitively after the 1988 Summer Olympic games and now lives in Oregon where he coaches wrestling and works for Keppler Speakers. In November 1999, John du Pont agreed in an out-of-court settlement of the civil suit filed against him by Nancy Schultz to pay Dave's three surviving heirs \"at least $35 million,\" the largest amount resulting from a U.S. wrongful-death suit ever paid directly by one person.\n\nA year after the shooting, du Pont, who had entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, went on trial at the Delaware County Courthouse in Media, Pennsylvania. After three weeks of testimony followed by seven days of deliberation by the six-man, six-woman jury to consider eight distinct possible verdicts, on February 25, 1997 du Pont was found guilty but mentally ill of murder in the third degree. He was subsequently sentenced by Common Pleas Judge Patricia Jenkins to 13 to 30 years in prison. According to then-Delaware County District Attorney (now MC R-PA7) Pat Meehan, du Pont was the richest American ever tried for murder in the United States. After a period of further psychiatric treatment at the Norristown State Hospital, du Pont was eventually transferred first to Cresson State Correctional Institution near Altoona, Pennsylvania and later to Laurel Highlands State Prison in Somerset, where he died on December 9, 2010 at age 72. Both facilities were formerly state-run mental hospitals. At the time of his death from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, John du Pont had been incarcerated for murder for almost 15 years.\n\nFoxcatcher Farm was eventually sold and the estate broken up for development. A segment is now occupied by the campus of The Episcopal Academy, a private independent K–12 school founded in 1785, which moved there in 2008 from split campuses located in the nearby Philadelphia Main Line communities of Merion and Devon. The 90-year-old du Pont mansion, Liseter Hall, in which du Pont was raised and had lived for 57 years, was demolished in January 2013. The mansion stood on a portion of the property that has now been developed by Toll Brothers into a \"master planned community of 449 luxury homes\" called \"Liseter Estate.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1014004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1014004", "title": "International Baseball Federation", "text": "International Baseball Federation\n\nThe International Baseball Federation (IBAF; Spanish: \"Federación Internacional de Béisbol\", French: \"Fédération internationale de baseball\") is the former worldwide governing body recognized by the International Olympic Committee as overseeing, deciding and executing the policy of the sport of baseball. The IBAF has since become the international baseball \"Division\" of the World Baseball Softball Confederation, the officially recognized world governing body for baseball (and softball). One of its principal responsibilities under the WBSC is to organize, standardize and sanction international competitions among baseball's 124 national governing bodies through its various tournaments to determine a world champion and calculate world rankings for both men's and women's baseball. Prior to the establishment of the WBSC, which has since superseded its authority, the IBAF had been the lone entity that can assign the title of \"world champion\" to any baseball team delegated to represent a nation. Its offices are housed within the WBSC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland—the Olympic Capital.\n\nThe first-ever international baseball event was a series of exhibition games that took place during the 1904 Summer Olympic Games in St. Louis, United States. The exhibition proved so successful that it was given an encore at the 1912 Summer Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThe two popular showings in St. Louis and Stockholm laid the groundwork for baseball's international surge in popularity, leading the sport to be placed onto the program as an exhibition sport at the 1936 Summer Olympic Games. This exhibition was extremely well received as 92,565 spectators filled the Olympic Stadium in Berlin to watch a game between two teams from the USA.\n\nFollowing the success of Berlin, the first ever Baseball World Cup was organized in London, England in August 1938. The United States and Great Britain engaged in five games, of which the British won four.\n\nThe growth of baseball competitions involving the representation of countries, coupled with the birth of the Baseball World Cup, provided the need for an institution to help develop, organize, regulate and oversee these events, thus the International Baseball Federation was established in 1938.\n\nConflicts of World War II prompted the IOC to cancel the Summer Games that had been scheduled to take place in Tokyo in 1940 and in London in 1944, thereby halting baseball's tour as a demonstration sport. Nevertheless, by 1950, the IBAF was able to expand the format of the Baseball World Cup that was contested in Managua, Nicaragua to 12 participating countries.\n\nIn 1951, the Pan American Games were established and baseball was on the official program from the onset.\n\nIn 1952, a Finnish version of baseball (Pesäpallo) was a demonstration sport at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nIn April 1953, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain came together to establish what is now known as the Confederation of European Baseball and organized the first ever European Baseball Championship a year later.\n\nThe Baseball Federation of Asia (BFA) was founded in May 1954 as the second continental confederation under the umbrella of the IBAF. The BFA wasted little time in organizing its first continental tournament, as it celebrated the Asian Baseball Championship in December of that same year in Manila, Philippines.\n\nThe exposure of baseball to an international audience continued at the 1956 Summer Olympic Games, which saw approximately 114,000 spectators slowly fill the Melbourne Cricket Ground to witness Australia vs. USA in a demonstration contest in Melbourne, Australia. This crowd of 114,000 was registered as a Guinness World Record for the largest attendance for any single baseball game. (The record lasted over 50 years before it was broken at a March 29, 2008 Major League Baseball exhibition game between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers that drew 115,300 people to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.)\n\nBaseball as an Olympic demonstration sport was finally able to take its act to Asia at the 1964 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, where baseball was already exceptionally popular.\n\nAt the following Summer Olympic Games in 1968, a selection of premier U.S. college players defeated the Cuban national team twice in Mexico City to win the tournament.\n\nIn 1973, the IBAF added the Intercontinental Cup to its tournament program.\n\nIn 1978, the IOC awarded the hosting rights of the 1984 Summer Olympics to Los Angeles, and Robert Smith quickly went to work, in his capacity as a member of the United States Olympic Committee prior to becoming IBAF President, to reestablish baseball as part of the Olympic Programme. Smith reached out to the then-Los Angeles Dodgers owner, Peter O'Malley, and University of Southern California head baseball coach and subsequent College Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, Rod Dedeaux. The group organized an IBAF congress the following year in Los Angeles in order to establish an Olympic Baseball Committee. Through these efforts, baseball was again categorized as a demonstration sport and an eight-team tournament was organized at Dodger Stadium, as part of the official Summer Olympic Programme. The present IBAF President, Riccardo Fraccari, was the head umpire of the championship game.\n\nA third branch of the IBAF continental confederations formed in 1985. The Pan American Baseball Confederation (COPABE) was finally established after it was deemed necessary due to the strong expansion and increase of the national member federations stemming from the Olympic Baseball Committee campaign. \nIn 1986, a historic IOC vote put baseball onto the Olympic Programme as a medal sport for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nBaseball would travel to Seoul, Korea for the 1988 Summer Olympic Games. This was the final time the IBAF, in conjunction with the IOC, would organize baseball as a demonstration sport at the Olympics before it became an official medal sport in 1992.\n\nIn 1989, the Baseball Confederation of Oceania (BCO) was established as the 4th branch of the IBAF.\nThe African Baseball and Softball Association (ABSA) was formed soon after the BCO in June 1990 in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nBaseball was played up in a traditional amateur format up until the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, USA.\n\nIn 1998, the IBAF, MLB and Major League Baseball Players Association reached an agreement to allow the participation of professional players in international competition.\n\nTeam USA used a minor league selection to beat Cuba in the gold medal game at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.\n\nCuba regained the world title, defeating Australia for the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n\nOn July 7, 2005, the IOC Session voted to remove baseball and softball from the 2012 Summer Olympics program.\n\nBaseball made its last Olympic appearance and Korea took the gold medal at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, China.\n\nThe IBAF, under President Harvey Schiller, attempted to reinstate baseball onto the Olympic Programme, but the IOC vote of August 2009 kept baseball off the 2016 program, as golf and rugby were selected.\n\nIn February 2011, Dr. Harvey Schiller was appointed as a member of the IOC's Women and Sport Commission.\nOn April 1, 2011, the IBAF, under first-year President Riccardo Fraccari, and the International Softball Federation announced that they were studying how to prepare a joint proposal in order to revive play of both sports at the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nAs part of that proposal, in April 2013, the two organizations began the process of merging into a new combined federation that will govern both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC).\n\nThe International Baseball Federation currently oversees and organizes the following world championship tournaments:\n\nThe first-ever 12U Baseball World Championship was played in Taipei from July 8 to 17, 2011. Taiwan won the first title.\n\nIn addition, the IBAF is the sanctioning body for the World Baseball Classic, which is hosted by Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association and held every four years in the year after the Summer Olympics. The IBAF abandoned its former world championship, the Baseball World Cup, after the 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic. It was originally intended to be the sanctioning body for the Premier 12, a new men's international tournament -- featuring the twelve best-ranked national teams -- that began in 2015; that tournament instead has been sanctioned by the WBSC. This event is played in the year preceding the Summer Olympics.\n\nThe IBAF discontinued the Intercontinental Cup, which was an invitational event and last held in 2010.\n\nEstimated data, according to the IBAF, as of April 2011:\n\nThe IBAF comprises five continental confederations that currently represent a total of 127 national member federations.\n\n\n\n(*) Aldo Notari died during the period as the president, thus the first vice president, Tom Peng of Taiwan, served as acting president from July 2006 to 2007.\n\nSee also: Baseball awards of the International Baseball Fedederation (IBAF)\n\n\n"}

Both of the clubs are from Gjilan one of the 7 largest cities of Kosovo, the derby was started in 1995 after the split of Drita. Initially the Kosovo media did not give importance to this derby but since 2012 the media has changed opinion for the derby. The rivalry comes about as Gjilani split from Drita and thus a new club was created.\n\nFor the past 20 years the match had attracted tens of thousands of partisan fans, even as Kosovo remained in political and sporting limbo following its war of independence from what is now Serbia between 1997 and 1998. Gjilan derby has added importance. In May, 2015, Kosovo was recognised by UEFA.\n\nIn 1995, the last stage of the championship of the Kosovo Superleague 1994/95, the main players of the Drita were dissatisfied with the leaders of the club, respectively with the treatment they had, so they slpited from Drita and created a new club in the city of Gjilan, which was originally called Gjilan '95\n\nUntil 1999, when the Kosovo War ended, this game was difficult to develop because the Serbian government did not allow Albanians to play at the stadiums.\n\nFans accused each other of lying about the foundations of the clubs. Intelektualët believe that SC Gjilani was founded in 1995 only after they inherited the FK Crvena Zvezda Gnjilane that was founded in 1945, Crvena Zvezda Gnjilane is accused by Intelektualët as a Serb nationalist club. While Skifterat accuse that FC Drita before had the name KF Poleti which was founded by Serbs and after a few years after many Albanians were in the club, for this reason the club changed its name to Drita. Both stories have been rejected by many officials from both clubs and citizen of the city.\n\nDrita, in the 1997–98 championship was a great team wherever in Kosovo and in many sporting games, the meetings started but it was difficult to name the fans. The Ballkani and Drita match was a tough game because Ballkani fought for the survival and Drita for champion, so the fans traveled to Suva Reka for the last time without a name after this game, before the game against biggest rival Gjilani, the board succumbed and after many debates the name was assigned because most of the players except they played were also writers, poets, politicians and so on.\n\nThe Intellectuals are the biggest ultras group in Kosovo, with many transfers outside Gjilan. They also have the record of audience in football of Kosovo, the biggest was against Gjilani in 2011 with 13,000 fans and they traveled also in 2002 with 30,000 fans to the final of the Kosovar Cup in the Fadil Vokrri Stadium.\n\n\"Skifterat\" are the clubs ultras group. They are formed in 1999, and are the biggest rivals of Drita supporters. The name means \"Falcon\" in English!\n\nThe great rivalry among these teams has also led to hooliganism.

It was home to the Brown University Bears basketball team as well as other teams. The gymnasium included a basketball court and seating, a second-floor running track, squash and handball courts, a wrestling room, a boxing room, and a fencing room.\n\nThe building was located at Aldrich Field, located on Elmgrove Avenue across from Brown Stadium. The land for Aldrich Field was a gift to the University from brothers Charles and Henry Aldrich, both alumni of Brown. The façade's clock face read \"A-L-D-R-I-C-H-F-I-E-L-D\" instead of the regular numbers, with the \"R\" being in place of the 12. The bronze statue of \"Bruno,\" the Brown bear mascot, was located just to the south of the main entrance on a pedestal containing a piece of slate said to have been from the spot where Roger Williams landed in what would become Providence in 1636. After Marvel Gym was closed, the statue was moved to the College Green, where it originally stood.\n\nOn October 7, 1938, the building was rededicated to the memory of Frederick W. \"Doc\" Marvel, class of 1896, a longtime athletic director. The building was in use until 1989, when the Pizzitola Sports Center opened at the Brown Athletic Conference. It was then closed and stood dormant until 2002, when it was demolished, well past its usefulness and becoming dangerously dilapidated. There are now practice fields on the site.\n\n"}

{"id": "641277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=641277", "title": "Minor league", "text": "Minor league\n\nMinor leagues are professional sports leagues which are not regarded as the premier leagues in those sports. Minor league teams tend to play in smaller, less elaborate venues, often competing in smaller cities/markets. This term is used in North America with regard to several organizations competing in various sports. They generally have lesser fan bases and smaller budgets.\n\nThe minor league concept is a manifestation of the franchise system used in North American sports, whereby the group of major league teams in each sport is fixed for long periods between expansions or other adjustments, which only take place with the consent of the major league owners. In Europe, and many other parts of the world, the football leagues have many divisions below the \"top-flight\" as part of the football pyramid. In other parts of the world there is usually either a system of annual promotion and relegation, meaning that clubs have no fixed status in the hierarchy, or there is only one professional league per country in each sport, rendering the major/minor distinction irrelevant.\n\nWhile there are various semi-professional football leagues, none have any affiliation with the National Football League (NFL). The NFL and its teams have had working relationships with several independent leagues in the past, including the Association of Professional Football Leagues, the Atlantic Coast Football League, and most recently, the league owned-and-operated NFL Europe. In modern times, the NFL has developed players not ready for the active roster through each team's practice squad.\n\nMany consider the Arena Football League to have been a \"de facto\" minor league, since several NFL owners had teams in it in the mid-2000s, prior to its bankruptcy and restructuring. Arena football is played under very different conditions, and the AFL had its own minor league, af2, until 2009. Several other independent indoor football leagues that play a similar game exist.\n\nSimilarly, the Canadian Football League, though it has developed ties with the NFL in recent years and has moved away from competing with the NFL for talent, plays a visibly different game than the American game, and the two sports favor different types of skills; the CFL arguably holds major league status in its home territory of Canada.\n\nSeveral minor or developmental leagues, independent of the NFL, have come and gone, such as the recent United Football League and the Fall Experimental Football League, but none have lasted more than a few seasons.\nOn November 27, 2016, it was reported by CBS Sports that the NFL will present formal proposals for a developmental league or in-season academy (with Troy Vincent prepared to make recommendations) in 2017. Vincent stated \"We are ready to socialize our findings to the respective committees at the Pro Bowl, Senior Bowl, and combine\" he also stated \"We have some viable potential options that are ready to share with the Competition Committee, the Coaches Subcommittee and with some of our active and former players\", \"Our goal is to create a platform that addresses the entire football community--coaches, officials, front office personnel and players--is essential to the long-term sustainability of our game.\"\n\nBelow Major League Soccer several lower-level leagues operate on both sides of the U.S.–Canada border as part of the American and Canadian soccer pyramids. As is standard for sports in both countries, the formal promotion and relegation system is not used, although teams have been informally \"promoted\" from lower leagues up to Major League Soccer. As of the current 2018 U.S.–Canada soccer season, the second level is the United Soccer League (USL), which will be rebranded as the USL Championship for 2019 and beyond. The North American Soccer League had previously been the second level, sharing that status with the USL in 2017, but major instability in the NASL led to the loss of that league's second-division status and raised serious questions as to its very survival. USL's parent organization, known as the United Soccer Leagues (note the plural), also operates USL League Two (formerly the Premier Development League, or PDL), a semi-professional league that has some age restrictions. The National Premier Soccer League operates at approximately the same level as League Two. While there was no official third-level professional league in 2018, the USL organization plans to launch USL League One at that level in 2019, and another third-level circuit, the National Independent Soccer Association, also plans a 2019 launch. \n\nIn 2013 Major League Soccer announced a partnership with the USL which began formal affiliation between some USL teams and MLS teams. The partnership has continued to deepen; several MLS teams now field their own reserve teams in the USL, and MLS now requires all of its teams to either field a reserve team in the USL or officially affiliate with a separately owned USL team. No formal relationship exists between NASL and the other leagues; NASL's commissioner has said he believes it will \"stay that way for some time\".\n\nMinor league baseball is almost as old as the professional game itself, and at first consisted of attempts to play baseball in smaller cities and towns independent of the National League, the first true major league. Soon, scouts for the National League were traveling to watch minor league teams play and attempting to sign the more talented ones away. Soon Major League Baseball began formal developmental agreements with some minor league teams, while others remained independent. \n\nSince it was first developed in the 1920s by St. Louis Cardinals executive Branch Rickey, the formal developmental affiliations have come to dominate minor league baseball, and the majority of minor leagues are part of the affiliated system. A general decline in minor league attendance occurred following the advent of television; minor league clubs only survived in many markets because their major league affiliations included financial support. The trend began to reverse in the 1990s, as new independent minor leagues began for the first time in decades and have become successful to varying levels.\n\nThe National Basketball Association has an affiliated minor league: the NBA G League (formerly called the \"NBA D-League\"). The now-defunct Continental Basketball Association (CBA) served some of the purposes of a minor league for the NBA for many years. However, there were no direct developmental agreements between CBA and NBA teams the way that there are between Major League Baseball and National Hockey League teams and their minor league affiliates.\n\nThe sport with the next most extensive system of minor league teams other than baseball is ice hockey. In North America, between 1988 and 2005, 233 minor ice hockey teams played in a total of 160 cities in 13 minor professional leagues. The vast majority of these teams played in the United States, with only 21 of these teams based in Canadian cities. 123 of these minor professional teams played in the southern United States. One reason given for the large number of American-based teams is that minor league franchises will frequently move from city to city, and even between leagues. In contrast, Canadian cities more commonly host major junior teams, which develop teenage prospects prior to their move to the professional leagues.\n\nThe American Hockey League is the most prominent of the minor hockey leagues in North America.\n\nCurrent minor leagues\n\nFormer minor leagues\n\nAll National Hockey League teams have a farm team in the American Hockey League and often share a team in the ECHL. On \"the farm\" the NHL team will develop young players, occasionally rehabilitate older players who are injured or whose quality of play has slumped. These teams, in turn, have lower-level minor leagues to draw players from and pass players down to. Minor ice hockey leagues should not be confused with Junior or Senior ice hockey leagues. They are different in that minor professional hockey leagues do not have restrictions on the age or experience levels of their players, but Junior and Senior leagues do.\n\nOther sports organizations considered to be minor leagues are golf's Web.com Tour and Symetra Tour, respectively affiliated with the PGA Tour and LPGA; NASCAR's Xfinity Series, Camping World Truck Series and Whelen All-American Series; and various other affiliated satellite tours of other individual sports, including the Challengers Tour of Professional Tennis.\n\n"}

It is based on the true story of Jim Morris, who had a brief, but famous Major League Baseball career in 1999–2000. The film stars Dennis Quaid, Rachel Griffiths, Jay Hernandez, and Brian Cox.\n\nJim Morris is the son of a career Navy man, who moves the family from Hollywood, Florida to Big Lake, Texas, in order to maintain job security. Jim is shown to be a very skilled pitcher, though his father disapproves of Jim's dream of making it to Major League Baseball. It is later mentioned that the town to which Jim's family moved, Big Lake, has lost its love for baseball, preferring football instead. Thus, he was unable to play baseball in high school. He later gets a chance when he is drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers, but he tears up his shoulder, ending his hopes of achieving his lifelong dream.\n\nYears later in 1999, Jim, married with three children, is a high school science teacher, as well as head baseball coach. His team, the Big Lake Owls, is very unsuccessful with many of his players skilled, but unmotivated, especially with very little community support. One day after practice, the team catcher offers to play catch with Jim. There it is revealed that Jim may still have his fastball, and it is soon displayed to the rest of the team. The Owls believe that Jim could possibly pitch in the major leagues and offer him a deal: If the Owls can win district and make the state playoffs, Jim will try out again, which Jim accepts. Furthermore, the team urges him to throw his fastball in batting practice, which immensely improves their hitting.\n\nThe Owls end up winning district and after their final win, the team tells Jim that, since they kept up their end of the deal, it is now his turn to do his part. After the Owls' season ends with a loss in the state tournament, Jim is told of a tryout nearby for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and Jim goes, without telling his wife, afraid that her fear of him re-injuring his shoulder would keep him from going. After his tryout, the professional scouts discover his ability to repeatedly throw a baseball at 98 miles per hour. The lead scout tells Jim that he could be signed to a minor-league deal. Jim's wife finds out after getting two phone messages from the Tampa Bay scouts and she is at first reluctant to let Jim go, citing his home responsibilities, but after seeing how Jim is inspiring their son, Hunter, she allows him to go. Jim tells his father, with whom he still has a cold relationship, of his situation, and his father once again tries to dissuade Jim from trying to achieve his dream again, telling Jim, \"It's OK to think about what you \"want\" to do until it's time to start doing what you were \"meant\" to do.\"\n\nHe is initially assigned to the minor league Class AA Orlando Rays (now the Montgomery Biscuits) but quickly moves up to the AAA Durham Bulls. Concerned for his family due to mounting bills (the pay in the minor leagues being low) Jim decides to give it up and come home. But his wife Lorri talks him out of it, not wanting Jim to give up again. Jim gets inspired again when he watches a Little League game one night, remembering the same love for baseball he had as a kid.\n\nIn September, Jim is told that the Major League club has called him up, and that they will be playing in Texas against the Rangers. Jim calls his family, who in turn informs the town. Advising his wife of the dress code in the majors, Jim finds his sports coat, a necktie and his St. Rita necklace hanging in his locker. St. Rita is the saint of impossible dreams. His family, high school players and many townspeople go to the game. Jim impresses many of the coaches in warm-ups with his fastball, and late in the game, with Tampa Bay losing badly, Jim is called into the game to pitch to Royce Clayton and end the inning. Jim ends up striking out Clayton on three straight fastballs. After the game, Jim gets interviewed by the press. During the interview, Jim notices his father had also come to the game. Jim's father finally admits that he is proud of what Jim has done and also apologizes for never supporting him. Jim thanks him and gives him the ball with which he had gotten the strikeout, and the two finally repair their relationship. Jim then meets with his family and all the townspeople who had come to the game, applauding Jim on his amazing success story.\n\nThe final scene shows the Big Lake high school trophy case, which has Jim's Major League jersey prominently displayed. It is then mentioned that Jim would go on to pitch in the majors for two seasons before retiring and returning to teaching in Texas.\n\n\nThe movie received generally positive reviews, with Dennis Quaid's performance receiving praise. Review aggregation site Rotten tomatoes reports an 83% \"Certified Fresh\" score from critics, with the consensus reading: \"A heart-warming sports flick, The Rookie greatly benefits from understated direction and the emotional honesty Dennis Quaid brings to the role of Jim Morris.\" Critics on Metacritic give it a 72 out of 100 based on 31 reviews.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\"The Rookie\" was filmed almost entirely in North and Central Texas. Apart from scenes filmed at The Ballpark in Arlington, locations included the following:\n\n\nMost of the population portrayed in this movie of Big Lake, Texas were fictional.

{"id": "44595212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44595212", "title": "Twickenham Cricket Club", "text": "Twickenham Cricket Club\n\nTwickenham Cricket Club is an amateur cricket club consisting of a number of teams of varying abilities, playing across various formats of cricket. The club’s pavilion is located on Twickenham Green, Twickenham in the London Borough of Richmond. The main home ground is on Twickenham Green and is roughly triangular in shape, bordered by Staines Road (the A305) to the North, Hampton Road to the South East and First Cross Road to the West.\n\nThe earliest record of cricket being played in Twickenham dates back to 1735 by Lady Suffolk, in a letter to her husband, suggesting she had learned of the game at Marble Hill House and might practice that afternoon. Under the name of Twickenham Cricket Club, the club prides itself on being amongst the oldest sporting teams and oldest cricket teams in the world. The first recorded match played by Twickenham Cricket Club was on 29 July 1833 against Thames Ditton. The two clubs met again for a centenary match a hundred years later, the match stands unique as the only joint centenary match played by the original teams.\n\nRecords of the 1833 match can be found on display within the pavilion along with records of matches over the following 20 years, which provide a rare insight into the early form and traditions of the game. Some matches being played \"For the Honour of the Game\" whilst other games were played for \"A New Ball\". Other quirks of the early games include batsmen being \"Thrown\" rather than \"Run Out\" and \"Hit Foot\" rather than \"LBW\" or \"Leg Before Wicket\". What is currently termed as a victory \"By and Innings\" was then referred to as \"Single Handed\".\n\nThe old score cards show comparatively low scores, with 73 being the highest individual batsman’s score for the twenty-year period (by comparison, in the 2014 season alone, 11 Twickenham batsmen scored centuries).\n\nSince 2007, Twickenham’s premier side has competed in the Middlesex County Cricket League (MCCL), winning promotion from Division 3 in their inaugural season under the captaincy of Jon Varney. Promotion from Division 2 to the MCCL Premier Division followed in 2009 thanks in part to a successful season by Ts ex Colt James Munting who took 5 wickets on 6 occasions, a standing club record. New captain, The powerful top order batsman Carlos Nunes was also influential with the bat. In a dramatic final game of the 2009 season the Twickenham tail were guided from a seemingly impossible position by the experienced John Paul Cronje, to achieve the necessary draw against promotion rivals, Southgate CC, to pip them to promotion. The dramatic achievement was immortalised by the opposition’s light hearted, comical depiction of how Adolf Hitler may have interpreted the result, on YouTube.\n\nTwickenham found Premier league cricket challenging, lasting just 2 seasons before they were relegated in 2011. The acquisition of Indian Left Arm spinner Parminder Singh in 2012 proved decisive as well as bringing on internal talent as he returned Twickenham CC best bowling figures of 18-8 early on in a season which saw him finish with a bowling average of just 10 runs per wicket taken. Promotion was secured with just 1 defeat all season and 12 victories (2 draws and 3 abandonments due to inclement weather). Singh continued leading the Twickenham attack and the records continued to be broken. In the 2013 season Twickenham finished mid table in the Premiership, thanks in no small part to Singh’s record breaking June when he took 18 wickets, the most by any Twickenham bowler in one month. In 2014 Singh took a club record 52 wickets in a season which saw Twickenham finish runners up only to Teddington in the club's highest ever league position.\n\nIn 2008 Twickenham increased their number of Saturday sides from the long-standing 4 teams to 5 with their 2nd XI and 3rd XI both playing in the appropriate MCCL Leagues. The 4th XI and 5th XI playing in the local 1987 league. Success of the higher rated teams in the club saw demand for places exceed supply in 2014 and in order to accommodate paid up members, a 6th XI was formed playing friendly matches. In the 2014 season, captains were Matthew Bendelow (2nd XI), Stuart Amos (3rd XI), Chetan Ubale (4th XI) and Hinay Dassani (5th XI). 6th Team captaincy varies from game to game and is the only club captain not elected.\n\nTwickenham have traditionally had 2 Sunday men’s sides, one playing competitive cricket in the Thameside League, the other playing friendly games. Middlesex launched their Development League in 2012 in which youth is mixed with up to 2 senior players within a side. In order to encourage participation from the younger generation, Development Cricket is played in coloured kit (Pyjama Cricket) and with a pink ball – similar to televised one day cricket. Twickenham CC won the inaugural season of the competition.\n\nTwickenham also runs a successful ladies team which competes in various forms of the game within Middlesex (League, Super 8 and T20). Twickenham ladies generally play games on Sunday’s and home games are played on The Green.\n\nIn addition to adult cricket, Twickenham run a number of Colts teams for younger players. Training and introduction to the game of cricket is available from the age of 5 through the specially designed Kwik Cricket form of the game. From the age of 9 to 17, players are able to progress to competitive cricket against other local colts side in age groups of under 10, under 11, under 12, under 13, under 15 and under 17. The colts section is run by Colts Secretary; Tony Ward and training is available from ECB Qualified coaches.\n\nTwickenham Vets (Veterans) were established in 2012 and is made up of players over the age of 40. Friendly games are played regularly throughout the season, against teams of varying standards, including but not exclusively against other vets teams. Fixtures are played on Sundays and captained by James Richards.\n\nThrough the season, Twickenham compete in a number of midweek fixtures with home games played on The Green. Fixtures include competitive 20/20 games and other friendly fixtures. Twickenham’s cricket week is traditionally run the first full week of August and includes a number of friendly games – including an annual game against Thames Ditton – to commemorate the original game in 1833.\n\nTwickenham annually runs an internal 6 a side tournament and regularly compete in the local Kew Sixes Tournament. Six-a-side tournaments are held over 1 day and tend to take a ‘World Cup’ format of group games followed by a knock out semi-final and final.
