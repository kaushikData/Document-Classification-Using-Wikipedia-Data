{"id": "7140901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7140901", "title": "Baseball stirrups", "text": "Baseball stirrups\n\nStirrups were uniform socks commonly worn by baseball players up until the mid-1990s, when major-league players began wearing their pants down to the ankles, setting a trend soon picked up by players in minor and amateur leagues. Until then, stirrup socks had been an integral part of the traditional baseball uniform, giving them a distinctive look. A high sock was needed because baseball players wore knickerbockers (\"knickers\"), worn by many boys in the late 19th century and into the 20th century. The stirrup socks served to display team colors, stripes or team logos. For example, for several years the Minnesota Twins wore navy-blue stirrups with \"TC\" on the side, for \"Twin Cities\", and in 1987 an \"m\" was placed on side. The Houston Astros wore navy blue stirrup socks with an orange star on the side. The stirrup sock colors were also the basis of team names, including the Cincinnati Red Stockings, Boston Red Sox, and Chicago White Sox. For these reasons, traditionalists lament the recent \"sockless\" look in baseball uniforms.\n\nStirrup socks are worn on top of long socks called \"sanitaries,\" usually white in color. This is because early color dyes in the outer stirrup sock were thought to pose health issues, as well as the fact that the inner, less expensive white sock could be changed more frequently. The stirrup sock lacked a foot, instead having a loop (\"stirrup\") which fits within the arch of the foot. Over the years, the stirrup loop tended to get longer, exposing more of the white undersock, thus creating a look unique to baseball.\n\nHowever, by the 1980s many players were pulling the loop so high that only the white undersock and the loop itself showed - the rest of the game sock being hidden by their pants. Eventually, this reached a point where some players only wore vertical lines for stirrups. For many years teams had enforced rules so that uniforms were worn \"uniformly\", including team socks. For example, Leo Durocher, longtime manager of the Chicago Cubs, had a measuring stick in the clubhouse. Players were required to match the length of their stirrup loops to this stick at about 4 inches, exposing only a small part of the white sanitary. Increasingly lax regulation of uniform codes by Major League Baseball eventually contributed to players ignoring the traditional look.\n\nThe Official Baseball Rules are silent on stirrups, but the fact that some players on a team wear them while others do not seems to be in violation of Rule 1.11(a)(1) which states that “all players on a team shall wear uniforms identical in color, trim and style,” as well as Rule 1.11(a)(3) that states “no player whose uniform does not conform to that of his teammates shall be permitted to participate in a game.”The freedom to wear high stirrups or not is remarkable considering how nowadays uniformity is otherwise enforced by MLB. For example, during a 2007 game against the Yankees, with the Yankees threatening to score, Red Sox manager Terry Francona was suddenly called away from the game and questioned by a league executive as to whether he was wearing the required uniform jersey beneath his blue pullover. He wasn’t pleased. \n\nAlthough some teams — particularly college teams — continue to wear traditional baseball stirrup socks, another option has been to replace the stirrup/undersock with a \"2 in 1\" combination sock that mimics the real thing, or simply to wear a single solid knee-high sock with knickers. The trend back to knickers and high socks is particularly evident among youth and high-school teams. A few pro players, such as Taijuan Walker of the Arizona Diamondbacks, Derek Holland of the Texas Rangers, Melvin Upton, Jr. of the San Diego Padres, Bryce Harper & Casey Janssen of the Washington Nationals, Daniel Descalso of the St. Louis Cardinals, Josh Outman of the Cleveland Indians and Steve Cishek & Juan Pierre of the Miami Marlins, Chris Archer of the Tampa Bay Rays, J.R. Graham of the Minnesota Twins, Chris Taylor of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Francisco Lindor of the Cleveland Indians have been spotted wearing genuine stirrups recently to much fanfare. Several players on the Philadelphia Phillies will either wear stirrups over white sanitary socks, or over red socks, as the Phillies stirrups sport their Liberty Bell logo. The minor-league Springfield Cardinals wear a 2-in-1 version of the traditional St. Louis Cardinals' game sock that looks very much like the real thing.\n\nOther sports also use, or have used, stirrup socks, but traditionally wore a white sweat sock over, instead of under, the colored stirrup game sock (e.g. basketball, football, hockey). For many years American football officials commonly wore black baseball-style stirrups as part of their uniform, although this was done away with in the 2010s as full-length pants replaced the traditional knickers. There are still some sock companies manufacturing stirrup socks for baseball and other sports, including Twin City Knitting Company in Conover, North Carolina.\n\n"}

Beer leagues can be of virtually any sport but are usually amateur and recreational in nature, not being tied to a larger competitive league system, and contested by adults. The consumption of alcohol is often encouraged during the contest, as the actual competition is secondary. This is beneficial to the adults that compete in these beer league events because not only are they supporting a small business, but they are getting physical activity, all while being social. For example, with Beer League Hockey over 174,000 adults play.

The company was established in 1904, and is the oldest sporting goods company in Philadelphia. By license agreements with Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, National Football League, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer and the Collegiate Licensing Company, the company has been producing vintage sports goods such as jerseys, jackets, hats, and wool-felt historic pennants.\n\nMitchell & Ness Sporting Goods first opened its doors in Philadelphia in 1904. Frank P. Mitchell, a former AAU tennis and wrestling champ, and Charles M. Ness, an avid golfer born in Scotland, together founded Mitchell & Ness Sporting Goods in 1904. Their original store made and strung hand-crafted tennis rackets and, using imported woods from Scotland, stolen from England, constructed custom-made golf clubs. In time, they expanded their business, selling uniforms to local baseball and football teams. When the Philadelphia Eagles entered the young National Football League in 1933, M&N supplied the team jerseys and equipment. Mitchell & Ness would continue to outfit the Eagles through the 1963 season.\n\nThe first time that the Mitchell & Ness label appeared on a major league baseball uniform –the Philadelphia Athletics– was in 1938. In the early 1940s, M&N began to supply Philadelphia's other major league baseball team –the Phillies. By the end of the decade, the Mitchell & Ness label was appearing on high school and college team uniforms throughout the Philadelphia area.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Mitchell & Ness had dropped the team business to concentrate on its retail operation. The store became a leading outlet for field hockey equipment and ski gear.\n\nMitchell & Ness almost went bankrupt in 1983. Owner Peter Capolino told the \"Detroit Free Press\", \"By 1983 all the expansion I had done had gone to hell. I fired 100 people, closed two warehouses. I reduced the company to a little store at 13th and Walnut Streets (in Philadelphia). It was down to just me and my wife.\"\n\nIn 1985, a customer walked into the store and asked if M&N could repair his 1960 Pirates game-worn vest, and his 1949 St Louis Browns game-worn shirt. They were both made of wool flannel as all baseball uniforms had been during that era. Mitchell & Ness found that it could do it, and with the realization that M&N was capable of this task, an idea was born: Reproduce historically accurate wool-flannel baseball uniforms.\n\nMitchell & Ness recruited history buffs and sports gurus most notably Capolino's friend Bob Downes. They dug through old newspapers, periodicals, books, programs, and old film footage. They consulted vintage uniform collectors throughout the country and visited the archives at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY.\n\nMajor League Baseball teams had stopped wearing wool flannel jerseys by 1972. Teams now wear double-knit polyester jerseys. In a dusty warehouse in North Philadelphia, Mitchell & Ness discovered rolls of old baseball flannel from 50 years earlier. They were still carefully wrapped, untouched, and in like-new condition ready to be cut and sewn.\n\nThe flannel was sewn. The lettering and patches were recreated and applied. The jerseys were completed, and they were offered for sale. The first shirts sold almost overnight. So did the second batch of a dozen or more. In time, Mitchell & Ness attracted customers from across the United States. Sports Illustrated wrote a flattering piece about M&N in June 1987.

{"id": "10877349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10877349", "title": "Nevill Ground", "text": "Nevill Ground\n\nThe Nevill Ground is a cricket ground at Royal Tunbridge Wells in the English county of Kent. It is owned by Tunbridge Wells Borough Council and is used by Tunbridge Wells Cricket Club in the summer months and by Tunbridge Wells Hockey Club in the winter. It was opened in 1898 and was first used by Kent County Cricket Club in 1901. The county has held the Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week on the ground annually, despite a suffragette arson attack which destroyed the pavilion in 1913.\n\nAs well as hosting over 180 of Kent's first-class cricket matches, the ground played host to a single One Day International during the 1983 Cricket World Cup and was used for one match during the 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup.\n\nThe ground is known for being one of the more picturesque county grounds in England and particularly for having rhododendron bushes around the perimeter. It is located around south-east of the centre of Tunbridge Wells in Hawkenbury.\n\nThe ground was established after the purchase of the land, in 1895, by the Tunbridge Wells Cricket, Football and Athletic Club and the Bluemantle's Cricket Club on a 99-year lease from William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny. It had formed part of his Eridge Park estate on the edge of Tunbridge Wells. Building of the ground's facilities started in 1896 and it was officially opened by the Marquess, after whom the ground was named, in 1898.\n\nThe original cricket pavilion on the ground was designed by local architect CH Strange and built in 1903 at a cost of £1,200. It was destroyed in an arson attack, generally believed to have been the responsibility of militant suffragettes, in April 1913. During the First World War the ground was requisitioned by the British army to graze cavalry horses, damaging the pitch, and during the Second World War it was again requisitioned for military purposes, this time to billet soldiers. Ownership of the ground was transferred in 1946 from the Tunbridge Wells Cricket, Football and Athletic Club to Tunbridge Wells Borough Council.\n\nIn the early 20th century the county boundary between Kent and Sussex ran through the ground, the course of a stream beneath the ground marking the boundary at the time. The rhododendron bushes around the ground are considered by cricket commentators as one of the defining images of the Nevill Ground and the ground has been described as \"one of the finest cricket grounds in England\".\n\nIn 1995 a permanent covered brick stand was built, named the Bluemantle Stand after the Bluemantle's Cricket Club pavilion which had been built on the site after the fire of 1913. Tunbridge Wells Borough Council has erected a temporary grandstand at the ground for some cricket weeks, sometimes funded by local businesses.\n\nOn 11 April 1913, the original pavilion was burnt down in an arson attack attributed to militant suffragettes. The fire was discovered by a passing lamplighter and the fire brigade extinguished the fire in an hour, too late to save the pavilion. In front of the remains of the building firemen found suffragette literature, an electric lantern and a photograph of leading suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst. It is generally believed that the fire was caused by militant suffragettes as part of a country-wide campaign of arson and other violent opposition to the withdrawal of the 1912 Franchise Bill co-ordinated by the Women's Social and Political Union.\n\nThe fire destroyed archives, including a print of the first Canterbury Cricket Week and the Bluemantle's Cricket Club's archives. The attack has often been linked to a comment from an unknown Kent official who is reported to have said \"It is not true that women are banned from the pavilion. Who do you think makes the teas?\". However women were admitted to all of Kent's pavilions by 1913 and there is no evidence that the comment was ever made. \n\nThere was an angry reaction to the attack locally and nationally. The National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage held a meeting in the town with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a member of Tunbridge Wells Cricket Club, attending, where he called the suffragettes \"female hooligans\" and compared the attack to \"blowing up a blind man and his dog\". A new pavilion was built using the original designs after a series of fund raising concerts at the Opera House. Construction was finished in nine weeks, with the building completed just before the start of Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week in July 1913.\n\nThe Nevill Ground is used regularly by Kent Cricket League team, Tunbridge Wells Cricket Club. It is also used during the winter by Tunbridge Wells Hockey Club as one of their venues for hockey. It was used for association football until 1903 and was originally used for cycle racing, athletics and archery. It is home to Tunbridge Wells Harriers, a running club, and the outfield was used for important lawn tennis competitions - Tunbridge Wells Lawn Tennis Club adjoins the ground.\n\nKent County Cricket Club use the ground as one of its outgrounds for at least one match each year. After a single match in 1901, the Tunbridge Wells Cricket Festival was established in 1902 and two first-class cricket matches were played every year, with the exception of the truncated 1919 season, until 1992, when the number was reduced. One-day fixtures have been played on the ground in some seasons.\n\nThe Nevill Ground was first used as an outground by Kent in 1901 at the behest of George Harris, 4th Baron Harris. In order to assist Kent, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council has contributed around £25,000 annually to cover the running costs of hosting Kent's games at the Nevill Ground. The Nevill Ground was popular with Kent's players due to its surroundings and it was described by cricket historian EW Swanton as \"no mean contender for the most delectable English cricket ground.\"\n\nIn 2012, Kent's Friends Life t20 match against Sussex was moved to the St Lawrence Ground after the Nevill Ground was flooded after heavy rainfall leading to the 100th Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week being cut short. The 2016 T20 fixture was the last one-day match to be held by Kent at the Nevill, the movement of one-day fixtures to blocks of games by the ECB meaning it was no longer considered possible to hold shorter matches at Tunbridge Wells. Kent's match at Tunbridge Wells in 2017 almost had to be moved to another ground due to concerns over the maintenance of the ground by Tunbridge Wells Borough Council. The pitch had been left uncovered by the council's ground staff and had flooded which, combined with poor maintenance of the outfield, meant that Kent's own ground staff had to work with Tunbridge Wells Cricket Club to ensure the game could go ahead. The 2018 fixture at the ground was confirmed in February 2018 after a pre-season pitch inspection by Kent, subject to a further inspection prior to the match itself. \n\nThe Nevill Ground was used as one of the grounds for the 1983 Cricket World Cup, hosting one group stage match between India and Zimbabwe on 18 June 1983. India's Kapil Dev scored 175 not out after the Indian side was initially reduced to 9/4. India won by 31 runs and qualified for the semi-finals, avoiding a play-off against Australia. India went on to win the tournament – their first World Cup title.\n\nDev's partnership of 126 runs with Syed Kirmani set a world record for the largest ninth wicket stand in ODI cricket. This match led to the Nevill Ground being held in high regard by Indian cricket fans with there being a view that the match inspired a change in the way cricket was played in India. Leading Indian players such as Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid have spoken about how India winning the tournament inspired them to dream of playing for their country.\n\nThere was no official television footage of the match as BBC cameramen were on strike on the day of the match, the Nevill Ground being ruled as too small with India and Zimbabwe being deemed too \"irrelevant\" for a camera crew to be sent to the match. Despite this there were reports of an Indian spectator who filmed unofficial coverage of the match with a camcorder. The tape was purchased by Dev after the match for an unknown amount, although it has been claimed that this is an urban legend and that there was no proof of this occurring.\n\nIn 2008, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the game, Dev returned to the Nevill Ground to film a news segment. Afterwards he was welcomed by representatives of Kent County Cricket Club and Tunbridge Wells Borough Council.\n\nThe ground was one of the venues used in the 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup, hosting one match between Australia and the West Indies. Australia won by eight wickets.\n\nA total of 187 first-class matches have been held on the ground, all featuring Kent as the home side. Another 27 List A fixtures have been played, all but one featuring Kent as the home side, the other being the One Day International between India and Zimbabwe held during the 1983 World Cup. Kent have also played six Twenty20 matches on the ground.\n\n\"All records last updated 30 March 2018\"\n\n\nThe 633 runs scored by Kent against Essex in 2015 set a new record for the highest score by the county on a home ground. As of 2018 it remains the fourth highest innings score in the county's history, having been surpassed in 2018 at Beckenham.\n\nKent's County Championship match at the Nevill Ground against Worcestershire in 1960 was, as of 2018, the last first-class match to finish in less than a day. After the match, Kent's Colin Cowdrey called the pitch \"disgraceful\".\n\n\nKapil Dev's 175 not out against Zimbabwe was a One Day International record for the highest number of individual runs scored. This record was later beaten by Viv Richards. The partnership of 126 runs between Kapil Dev and Syed Kirmani set the world record for the highest ninth wicket partnership in an ODI of 126 not out. This record stood for 27 years before being beaten by Angelo Mathews and Lasith Malinga for Sri Lanka.\n\nThe highest score made in the six T20 matches held on the ground was 182/4 made by Kent in 2009 against Hampshire. Daniel Bell-Drummond made the only century on the ground in T20 cricket, scoring 112 not out in 2016 against Surrey, at the same time setting a new Kent record for any partnership in T20 cricket of 151 runs with Sam Northeast. This record was beaten twice the following year by Bell-Drummond and Joe Denly, although it remains a Kent record for the 2nd wicket in T20 cricket.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3538948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3538948", "title": "Throw (grappling)", "text": "Throw (grappling)\n\nA throw, in martial arts, is a grappling technique that involves off-balancing or lifting an opponent, and throwing them to the ground, in Japanese martial arts referred to as \"nage-waza\", 投げ技, \"throwing technique\". Throws usually involve a rotating motion, the practitioner performing the throw disconnects with the opponent, and ends balanced and on their feet as opposed to a takedown where both finish on the ground. Throws can however also be followed into a top position, in which case the person executing the throw does not disengage from the opponent. Certain throwing techniques called sacrifice throws (\"sutemi-waza\", 捨身技, \"sacrifice technique\") involve putting oneself in a potentially disadvantageous position, such as on the ground, in order to execute a throw.\n\nThere are several major types of throw, among Asian martial arts, judo has the most developed throwing techniques and throws are considered its specialty.\n\nMost throws are named by describing the circumvention point of the throw (e.g., hip throw, shoulder throw, wrist throw etc.), or the nature of effect of the throw on the opponent (e.g., heaven and earth throw, valley drop, body drop) with variations are given descriptive names. The names used here are attributed to Jujutsu throws (and hence judo/aikido throws) are descriptions in Japanese. It is conventional for the Japanese to name their throws in this manner, and many western martial art dojos have given English names to the throws feeling that it is easier for English speaking students to remember the names of throws if they can associate the throws by the descriptive nature of the throw name.\n\nIn judo, throws are divided into six categories—hand techniques, leg techniques, hip techniques, shoulder techniques, as well as sacrifice throws to the rear and side.\n\nA shoulder throw involves throwing an opponent over the shoulder. A shoulder throw which lifts the opponent from the ground is in Japanese referred to as \"seoi-nage\" (背負い投げ, \"Back Throw\"), while a throw which involves upsetting the opponents balance and pulling the opponent over the shoulder is referred to as \"seoi-otoshi\" (背負落とし, \"Back Drop\"). Seoi-nage is one of the most used throws in Judo competition. One study indicated that approximately 56% of judokas implemented the technique.\n\nA common shoulder throw is judo's ippon seoinage (\"Single-Handed Back Throw\") or the similar \"flying mare\" in wrestling.\n\nIn a \"leg reap\", the attacker uses one of their legs to reap one or both of their opponent's legs off the ground. Generally the opponent's weight is placed on the leg that is reaped away. This coupled with the attacker controlling the opponent's body with their hands causes the opponent to fall over. Common leg reaps are judo's Ouchi Gari, Kouchi Gari, Osoto Gari, and Kosoto Gari there are similar techniques in wrestling, including the inside and outside trips.\n\nSomewhat similar to leg reaps involve a hooking or lifting action with the attacking leg instead of a reaping action. The border between the two types of throw can be unclear, and many throws will exhibit characteristics of both reaps and trips, however, the difference is that a reap is one smooth move, like that of a scythe, whereas a hook is pulling the opponents leg up first, and then swinging it away. Common leg trips are hooking variations of Ouchi Gari and Osoto Gari along with Kosoto Gake, referred to as inside and outside trips in Western wrestling.\n\nA hip throw involves using the thrower's hip as a pivot point, by placing the hip in a lower position than an opponent's center of gravity. There are several types of hip throws such as O Goshi, which is often taught first to novices. Hip throws in Judo are called Koshi Waza, and in Aikido or Sumo they are called koshinage.\n\nSacrifice throws require the thrower to move into a potentially disadvantageous position in order to be executed, such as falling to the ground. The momentum of the falling body adds power to the throw and requires comparatively little strength, compared to the effect. In Judo (as well as in other martial arts) these throws are called Sutemi Waza and are further divided into rear (Masutemi waza) and side (Yoko Sutemi Waza) throws. In Judo, these throws are limited to a specific grade and higher due to the element of danger that is placed upon both the Uke (receiver) and the Tori (thrower).\n\nPickups involve lifting the opponent off the ground and then bringing them down again. Common pick-ups are lifting variations of the double leg takedown, judo's Te Guruma or \"sukui nage\" (both classified as hand throws) and the suplex from wrestling, in which the attacker lifts their opponents body vertically and throws the opponent over their own center of gravity while executing a back fall (usually accompanied by a back arch). Variations of the suplex are common in most forms of wrestling and sometimes used in Mixed Martial Arts competition. In Judo the \"ura-nage\" throw is a version of the suplex, but it is importantly classified as a sacrifice throw.\n\nSome of the more common throwing techniques are listed below. This is not an exhaustive list and the techniques may be referred to by other names in different styles. An English translation and a common Japanese equivalent are given.\n\n\n"}

The museum was built adjacent to Yogi Berra Stadium, which hosts the New Jersey Jackals, a Minor League Baseball team in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, and the Montclair State Red Hawks baseball team. The museum was dedicated in October 1998, with fellow Baseball Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Larry Doby in attendance. It opened to the public on December 4. In 2010, IKON 5 Architects redesigned the museum, and Brian Hanlon sculpted a statue of Berra to go in front of the museum.\n\nBerra had feuded with Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner since his firing 16 games into the 1985 season. Berra refused to have any part of Yankees events, including Yankees games. In January 1999, Berra and Steinbrenner resolved their feud with a public event at the Yogi Berra Museum.\n\nBerra frequently visited the museum for signings, discussions, and other events. It was his intention to teach children important values such as sportsmanship and dedication, both on and off the baseball diamond.\n\nOn October 8, 2014, a burglary occurred at the museum, in which a team of \"professional\" thieves stole specific pieces of Berra's memorabilia.\n\nThe museum contains items from Berra's career, including baseball cards, a jacket worn by Berra while throwing out the first pitch of Game 1 of the 2009 World Series, two of his MLB MVP awards, and all 10 World Series rings he received as a player. Following the resolution of Berra's feud with Steinbrenner, the Yankees loaned the Commissioner's Trophy from the 1998 World Series to the museum.\n\nIn 2013, the museum teamed up with Athlete Ally to develop an exhibit called \"Championing Respect\", which aims to support the inclusion of LGBT athletes in sports. An exhibit in 2014 celebrated the 75th anniversary of Lou Gehrig's farewell speech.\n\nThe Museum offers a wide range of school and public programs on all aspects of sports and society. It conducts guided school tours and education programs, provides off-site assemblies on anti-bullying and sportsmanship, and also collaborates with Montclair State University on programs examining topical issues in media and sports.\n\nIn promoting the values of respect and sportsmanship, the Museum, in partnership with Investors Bank and the Super Essex Conference, developed a Best Teammate Award program in 2013, recognizing outstanding leadership by student-athletes.\n\nThe Museum also offers an array of summer camps, including youth baseball and softball camps.\n"}
