The four Challenges, from 1929 to 1934, were major aviation events in pre-war Europe. The 1934 Challenge was won by the Polish pilots, who had also won the previous year.\n\nPoland and the Polish Aero Club organized the contest because a Polish pilot Franciszek Żwirko had won the previous Challenge in 1932. The contest rules were announced in June 1933: like the previous contest, it consisted of three parts: technical trials, a rally over Europe and a maximum speed trial, but there were changes in details. Since one of the aims of the Challenges was to stimulate the development of tourist aircraft, a stress was placed upon aircraft performance and quality, although pilots' skills remained crucial.\n\nThe opening ceremony was held at noon on August 28, 1934, at Mokotowskie field in Warsaw (the Italian team was late by two hours due to weather and arrived during the ceremony). During an air show, a Polish fighter PZL P.7a performing aerobatics crashed, but the pilot survived with injuries.\n\nThe number of crews and aircraft that eventually took part in the 1934 Challenge was smaller - 34 compared to 43 in the 1932 Challenge, because the contest was more difficult. The aircraft flew with a two-man crew (pilot and mechanic). Only four countries entered teams for the Challenge in 1934: Poland (12 crews), Germany (13 crews), Italy (6 crews) and Czechoslovakia (3 crews). The British aviator Walter MacPherson entered the contest in the Polish team. The French team of eight crews resigned from the contest, because a development of a new aircraft, the Caudron C.500 had not finished in time and its weight was too great. The first prize in the Challenge was 100,000 French francs, the second 40,000 FF, the third 20,000 FF and the fourth 10,000 FF; 15 other crews would get 6,000 FF.\n\nThe Challenge was to be a contest of tourist aircraft, so competing aircraft had to be able to take at least two persons aboard, take off and land on a short field and cover a distance with a good cruise speed. For this Challenge, all countries designed new aircraft especially to meet the contest demands, the only exception was a single de Havilland Puss Moth flown by MacPherson, although this had been was modified for the competition. All these aircraft were monoplanes with 3 or 4 seats in an enclosed cabin, advanced wing design with (flaps and slats and some other devices) and mixed or metal construction.\nMost aircraft were fast cantilever low-wing monoplanes: the German Messerschmitt Bf 108 (4), Fieseler Fi 97 (5) and Klemm Kl 36 (4), the Polish PZL.26 (5) and the Italian Pallavicino PS-1 (2) or braced low-wing monoplanes: the Czechoslovak Aero A.200 (2) and the Italian Breda Ba.39 (2) and Ba.42 (2). An exception were the basic aircraft of the Polish team - high-wing braced monoplanes RWD-9 (7), one of which was also flown by the Czechoslovak crew, and the Puss Moth. Of those, the Bf 108 and PS-1 had a retractable landing gear.\n\nThe German aircraft had starting numbers from a range 12-26, the Italian 41-46, the Czechoslovak 51-54 and the Polish 61-81: the numbers were placed on the fuselage in a black square frame.\n\nOn August 29 the technical evaluation of the competing aircraft's construction started. Since it was a tourist aircraft contest, features such as a comfortable cabin with a good view, the presence of the third and fourth seats, seats placed side-by-side, a comprehensive set of controls, ease and time of engine starting, ease of wings' folding, safety devices and modern construction with the use of metal were awarded points. The view was evaluated by placing a lamp in the cabin while the aircraft was in a dark hangar and examining light area. All the German aircraft, two Italian and the Puss Moth exceeded theempty weight limit of and had to have some unnecessary parts removed. The first technical trial to be completed was a quick engine starting, carried on 31 August-1 September. Most aircraft scored the maximum 24 points in it.\n\nTechnical evaluation lasted until September 4, and the most points were given to the Bf 108s (450-452 pts),followed by the Pallavicino PS-1 (438 pts), the Fi 97s (428-431 pts), the Aero A.200 (429 pts) and the RWD-9 (427 pts). The other scores were: Klemm Kl 36 - 394-407 pts, PZL.26 - 383 pts, Puss Moth - 373 pts and Bredas - 323-346 pts.\n\nOn September 3–4 there was a short take off trial, which required the crews to fly over an high barrier. The best performer was the Czechoslovak Vojtěch Žáček, taking off from the closest distance of (Aero A.200), then Jerzy Bajan (RWD-9) and Ján Ambruš with the second A.200. The Polish RWD-9s and PZL.26s and the German Fi 97s also performed well, while the Italians and most other German aircraft appeared inferior, with results above . For comparison, the best result from the previous Challenge was .\n\nAfter the technical evaluation and the short take-off trial, on September 4 the leaders were the Germans flying Bf 108s: Theo Osterkamp (597 points), Werner Junck (596 points) and Otto Brindlinger (594 points), then Vojtěch Žáček (A.200, 594 points), Jerzy Bajan (RWD-9, 591 points) and Ján Ambruš (A.200, 591 points), then German Fi 97s and Polish RWD-9s.\n\nNext, on September 4–5, followed a short landing trial, behind an 8-m high barrier. The best result, (210 points) was achieved by Hans Seidemann (Fi 97). In the first ten scores there were other Fieselers, the Polish RWD-9s and PZL.26s and MacPherson's Puss Moth. The Czechoslovak A.200s had the worst results, above , along with Bredas and Bf 108s. The best result from the previous Challenge was .\nA fuel consumption trial on a closed circuit was held on September 5. The best were three Bf 108s, scoring 86-95 pts, then five Poles with 73-79 points. Quite good results were scored by the Italians, while the German Fi 97s and Kl 36s and the Czechoslovaks were worst in this trial. \nAfter further trials had been completed, on September 5 the leaders of a general classification changed and remained similar until the end of this part. Leaders were: Jerzy Bajan (RWD-9S, 875 pts), Tadeusz Karpiński (RWD-9S, 856 pts), Hans Seidemann (Fi 97, 850 pts), Gerhard Hubrich (Fi 97, 848 pts), Stanisław Płonczyński (RWD-9, 844 pts), then Karl Francke (Bf 108), Jan Buczyński (RWD-9), Wolf Hirth (Fi 97), Szczepan Grzeszczyk (PZL.26).\n\nA minimal speed trial started on August 31, but it had to be continued on September 2 due to weather and some crews completed it only on September 6. The Pole Jerzy Bajan flying the RWD-9 was the slowest with a speed of . Good results below 60 km/h were obtained by the other RWD-9s, the Czechoslovaks and the German Kl 36s and Fi 97s; the worst were Italian Bredas - above 75 km/h, what was not scored (a new device - slots in wings fitted in Bredas, proved useless in practice).\n\nOn September 1 there was a trial of quick folding of wings, which was a feature to save space in hangars. Also the aircraft dimensions and the way of folding were awarded points. The trial was completed only on September 6, and first 7 results were of RWD-9s with 36 points, followed by four Italians.\n\nOne German and one Italian crews damaged their aircraft during technical trials (Bf 108 and PS-1) and had to retire. It was however the best ratio of crews to complete the technical trials of all Challenges. Generally, top places were taken by RWD-9s and Fi 97s, while Bf 108s, Kl 36s and PZL.26s proved average, and Italian machines closed a list with 559-801 points.\n\nThe second part of the Challenge was a 9537.4 km rally over Europe and northern Africa, on a path: Warsaw - Königsberg - Berlin - Köln - Brussels - Paris - Bordeaux - Pau - Madrid - Seville - Casablanca - Meknes - Sidi Bel Abbes - Algiers (stage waypoint) - Biskra - Tunis - Palermo - Naples - Rome - Rimini - Zagreb - Vienna - Brno - Prague - Katowice - Lwów - Wilno - Warsaw. There were also 8 checkpoints, among others, in Tanger, Messina and Castelfranco Veneto. The route was far longer and more difficult, than in previous contests. Awarded were, first of all, a cruise speed on a whole track, then a regularity of flight. Three nights apart from appointed airfields or a cruise speed below 130 km/h caused disqualification.\n\nThe rally started on September 7, in rain, between 5 and 5.30 am. The Bf 108s could take advantage of their speed and were first to reach Berlin. That day 24 fastest crews reached Paris, flying 1752.4 km (10 Poles, 8 Germans, 3 Czechoslovaks and 3 Italians). The German Wolfgang Stein (Kl 36) and the Italian team's captain Ambrogio Colombo (Ba-42) had to land and quit due to engine faults. Several crews had similar problems, but managed to repair them.\n\nOn the next day, many crews, who started early, especially flying Bf 108s, had problems with locating an airfield in Bordeaux due to heavy fog and had forced landings, lowering their cruise speed (on that occasion, Theo Osterkamp and Gerhard Hubrich had problems with the local police). One Klemm Kl 36 was damaged during a forced landing and had to withdraw (Ernst Krüger). Most - 14 crews reached Seville that day, 9 stayed in Madrid, while last two crews remained in Bordeaux, including Stanisław Płonczyński (RWD-9). Two Poles (Andrzej Włodarkiewicz and Szczepan Grzeszczyk on PZL.26s) reached as far, as Casablanca (3715.2 km).\n\nOn September 9 all crews, that remained in the rally, reached Africa, with Andrzej Włodarkiewicz and three Bf 108s being in the lead. 18 crews reached Algiers that day (9 Poles, 6 Germans and 3 Czechs), flying 4774 km in total. Last two crews reached Meknes, including Stanisław Płonczyński. Several crews withdrew that day: Fritz Morzik (the winner of 1929 and 1930 Challenges, flying Kl 36) had three forced landings before Algiers due to a fuel pump fault, also Szczepan Grzeszczyk's PZL.26's engine failed and he had a forced landing before Sidi Bel Abbes. Other German Kraft Eberhard (Kl 36) withdrew in Spain due to wing damage, the Pole Tadeusz Karpiński (RWD-9) quit in Seville because of low cruise speed, and one Italian quit because of illness (Pierro de Angeli). On September 10 the rest reached Algiers, and thus 24 crews completed the first part of the rally. The Pole Stefan Florjanowicz (RWD-9) had to withdraw there due to engine fault.\n\nThe contestants left Algiers on September 11, after a rest, and 23 crews reached Tunis that day. On September 12, the crews left for Palermo, over the Mediterranean Sea. The flight was secured by the Italian Navy and the French floatplanes. 22 crews reached Rome that day, one Italian pilot withdrew due to engine damage.\n\nOn September 13 the weather was bad, but all but two crews reached Prague (7924 km). The fastest that day was Theo Osterkamp (Bf 108), but other two Bf 108 pilots had forced landings near Trieste due to weather and spent night at Zagreb, what lowered their cruise speed.\n\nOn September 14, sixteen crews finished in Warsaw, greeted by crowds, the first was the Pole Ignacy Giedgowd (PZL-26). Among them were five Poles, six Germans, three Czechoslovaks and two Italians. That day, the fastest Polish pilot Andrzej Włodarkiewicz (PZL-26) had to land near Tarnów before Lwów and withdrew due to engine fault, also Walter MacPherson (Puss Moth) dropped out for the same reason before Lwów.\n\nOn September 15 last three crews reached Warsaw (Werner Junck and Karl Francke flying Bf 108s and Piotr Dudziński flying PZL.26). The last to drop out was Jan Balcer (PZL.26) due to a compressor damage, before Wilno. Fritz Morzik (Kl 36), Tadeusz Karpiński (RWD-9) and Andrzej Włodarkiewicz (PZL.26) finished that day in Warsaw, after repairing their aircraft, flying off the contest.\n\nOnly 19 crews out of 32 completed the rally. The only team to finish complete was the Czechoslovak one; apart from their A.200s, only all Fieseler Fi 97s completed the contest. In spite of highest maximum cruise speeds, the results of fastest Bf 108s was hampered by low cruise speeds in other stages of the rally. Best results were obtained by pilots who managed to maintain a good cruise speed during the whole rally. All participants who completed the rally, scored maximal amount of 160 points for regularity, spending nights on appointed airfields only.\n\nAfter the technical trials and the race, Jerzy Bajan held first place in the general classification with 1855 points, with Stanisław Płonczyński in second with 1821 pts, Hans Seidemann in third with 1813 pts, followed by two Czechoslovaks, Slovak Ján Ambruš (1795 pts) and Czech Jan Anderle (1770 pts). Bf 108 pilots were 12th (Werner Junck - 1733 pts), 13th (Theo Osterkamp - 1729 pts) and 15th (Karl Francke - 1715 pts).\n\nThe last part of the Challenge was a maximum speed trial, on a 297 km triangular course. The trial was carried out on Sunday, September 16, from 4 pm, at the Mokotowskie airfield in Warsaw.\n\nDue to a handicapping system, contestants took off in order of general classification, with proper intervals, and an amount of points given in the speed trial meant, that the first on the finishing line would be the winner of the contest. Each km/h above 210 km/h was awarded with one point.\n\nThe fastest were three German Bf 108s, with Theo Osterkamp at the lead (291 km/h). Next three places were taken by the Polish RWD-9s: Stanisław Płonczyński, Jan Buczyński, Jerzy Bajan and Henryk Skrzypiński, the later ex eaquo with Hans Seidemann (Fi 97). The Pole Ignacy Giedgowd (PZL.26) and the Italian Ernesto Sanzin (Ba-39S) had to land due to engine faults and scored 0 points.\n\nBf 108s managed to improve their positions, but first four places in general classification have not changed. The first contestants arrived in order: Bajan - Płonczyński - Seidemann - Ambruz - Osterkamp - Junck.\n\nA closing ceremony was held soon after the maximum speed test on September 16. The winners were the Polish crew of pilot Jerzy Bajan and mechanic Gustaw Pokrzywka. Their success was not only a result of their aviation skills, but also of the technical features of their Polish-designed RWD-9. Due to their victory, Poland had a right to organize the next Challenge in 1936, but it decided not to, because of financial reasons. The FAI proposed that other countries organize the contest, but Germany, Italy and France declined. The 1934 Challenge remained the last Challenge and the Polish Aero Club was given a right to retain a transitory cup.\n\n\n\n"}

The rink is unusual for Norway in that it has the National Hockey League rink size. The building is designed by Arkitektkontoret Jobb and is named for DNB, a Norwegian banking group.\n\nPlans for a new venue to replace the aging Stavanger Ishall were first articulated by club-owner Tore Christiansen in 2006. Construction started in May 2011, with Kruse Smith as the main contractor. Construction cost 210 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The venue is owned by the Oilers' investment company, which receives a combined 9 million per year from DNB and the municipality. The arena hosted group stages of 2012–13 IIHF Continental Cup and 2013 IIHF Women's World Championship Division I.\n\nPlans for a new arena for the Stavanger Oilers was first articulated by club-owner and chairman Tore Christiansen in 2006. By 2007 the Oilers had the highest attendance of any team in the GET-Ligaen, when they reached an average 2,000. The club stated that additional increase would be difficult, especially because seats were all sold to season ticket holders and that terrace spaces were only being sold to top matches.\n\nThe city council passed the zoning plan for the arena area on 19 October 2009. However, construction start was delayed after a disagreement arose between the municipality and the arena company regarding the use of commercial areas. Part of the financing comes from NOK 4 million per year over 20 years paid by the municipality for ice time for local clubs. Construction commenced on 13 May 2011 with Kruse Smith as the main contractor. The project was originally named Oilers Arena, but in September 2011 the club signed a ten-year agreement with DNB for the naming rights, worth NOK 5 million per year. The building made of prefabricated elements manufactured by Spenncon. Construction cost NOK 210 million.\n\nAhead of the 2012–13 season, the Oilers sold 3,000 season tickets. The arena was inaugurated with an Oilers training session on 1 October. Stavanger Municipal Council gave, against the votes of the Christian Democratic Party and the Socialist Left Party, a temporary permission to serve alcoholic beverages at matches. The team stated that they hoped this would pave the way for alcohol service at other sports events in the country. The first match took place on 7 October, with Oilers beating 3–2.\n\nDNB Arena is located at Madlaveien, next to the Oilers' old venue Stavanger Ishall (also known as Siddishallen).

It is the largest stadium in Chile with an official capacity of 48,665. It is part of a 62 hectare sporting complex which also features tennis courts, an aquatics center, a modern gymnasium, a velodrome, a BMX circuit, and an assistant ground/warmup athletics track.\n\nConstruction began in February 1937 and the stadium was inaugurated on December 3, 1938. The architecture was based on the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany. The stadium was one of the venues for the FIFA World Cup in 1962, and hosted the final where Brazil defeated Czechoslovakia 3-1. In 1948, the stadium hosted the matches of the South American Championship of Champions, the competition that inspired the creation of the UEFA Champions League and of the Copa Libertadores. The stadium was notoriously used as a prison camp and torture facility by the military regime following the Chilean coup d'état.\n\nIn 2009, a complete modernization plan was unveiled for the stadium and surrounding facilities. President Michelle Bachelet said it would become the most modern stadium in South America.\nThe stadium will be the Opening and Closing ceremonies, athletics and football venue for the 2023 Pan American Games.\nThe stadium was built on former farmland, donated in 1918 by farmer Jose Domingo Cañas. The first sporting event in the new stadium took place on 3 December 1938, with a friendly game between the Chilean club Colo-Colo and Brazilian club São Cristóvão. Colo-Colo won 6–3.\n\nIt has hosted all matches of the 1941, 1945 and 1955 South American Football Championships, and several matches of the 1991 and 2015 Copa América.\n\nThe stadium hosted the final stages of the 1959 World Basketball Championship. It was held outdoors because the intended venue, the Metropolitan Indoor Stadium, was not ready in time.\n\nIn the early 1960s, under the government of Jorge Alessandri, the stadium was expanded to host the 1962 FIFA World Cup. The main change was that the velodrome that surrounded the stadium was replaced by galleries, thereby increasing its original capacity to around 95,000.\n\nThe stadium hosted group stage games between Italy, West Germany, Switzerland and Chile, including a notoriously ill-tempered and violent clash between Italy and Chile which became known as the Battle of Santiago. Also held at the ground were a quarter-final, a semi-final, the third place play-off, and the final, in which Brazil was crowned world champions for the second time. In the third-place play-off, Chile defeated Yugoslavia 1–0, marking the team's greatest success in international football.\n\nToday, the ground serves as the home field for both the national team and the first-division club Universidad de Chile. It also hosts non-sporting events, such as political celebrations, charity events and concerts.\n\nThe stadium has been used since 1995 as the final leg of the Telethon, a 28-hour telecast. The stadium holds up to 100,000 people for this annual event with the Jumbotron showing the required amount to reach the goal and its current total.\n\nOn July 5, 2008, the stadium was officially renamed \"Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos\", in honor of a recently deceased sports journalist.\n\nAfter the coup d'état of September 11, 1973 that ousted President Salvador Allende, the stadium began to be used as a detention facility. An article in the \"Harvard Review of Latin America\" reported that \"there were over eighty detention centers in Santiago alone\" and gave details of the National Stadium and others.\n\nOver 40,000 people spent time in the compound during the \"junta\" regime. Twelve thousand detainees were interned between September 11 and November 7. The field and gallery were used to hold men, while women were held in the swimming pool changing rooms and associated buildings. Locker rooms and corridors were all used as prison facilities while interrogations were carried out in the velodrome. The Red Cross estimated that 7,000 prisoners occupied the stadium at one point, of whom about 300 were foreigners. According to the testimonies of survivors collected by the humanitarian group, detainees were tortured and threatened with death by shooting. Some were shot on the premises and then taken to unknown locations for execution.\n\nFIFA President Sir Stanley Rous insisted the USSR team to play a World Cup qualifier at the time. They however refused to do so and Chile qualified automatically for the 1974 World Cup, where they failed to advance from a group containing both West and East Germany and Australia.\n\nThe use of the stadium during the coup d'état is depicted in the 2002 documentary film \"Estadio Nacional\", directed and produced by Carmen Luz Parot, and in the 2007 Swedish film \"The Black Pimpernel\", which is based on the story of Swedish ambassador in Chile Harald Edelstam and his heroic actions to protect the lives of over 1,200 people during and after the military coup. \"The Black Pimpernel\" was shot on location in Santiago. The 1982 film \"Missing\" by Greek filmmaker Costa-Gavras depicts the September 11, 1973 coup d'état and execution of American journalists Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi at the Estadio Nacional.\n\nIn 2011, Chile set aside a section of the stadium, a section of old wooden bleachers called , to honor the prisoners who were detained there.\n\nOn June 15, 2009, President Michelle Bachelet announced several infrastructure improvements in order to modernize the stadium and its immediate facilities. Out of the total 24 billion pesos (US$42.3 million) contemplated in the plan, 20 billion pesos (US$35.3 million) are destined to bring the stadium up to modern standards. The changes include, a roof covering all the seats, which will also provide illumination; installation of seats around the entire stadium, lowering the current capacity to 47,000; a new state-of-the-art scoreboard; a 2.5 m deep 2 m wide pit will separate the track and the spectators to replace the fence; and several other changes. Because the stadium is a national monument the façade will remain the same, with the roof structure placed on top, without modifying the exterior. The stadium was closed on August 15, 2009. The stadium was scheduled to be reinaugurated in March 2010 to stage a double friendly match between Chile and North Korea and Panama, but the works were not finished on time. The construction of the roof has since been postponed by the government of President Sebastián Piñera due to financial constraints brought about by the February 27, 2010 earthquake. Although the stadium suffered minor damage from the earthquake, it partially opened to host the match between C.F. Universidad de Chile and C.D. Guadalajara for Copa Libertadores 2010. It was officially re-inaugurated on September 12, 2010, during Chile's bicentennial festivities.\n\nOn September 12, 2010, during the Chilean bicentennial festivities, President Sebastián Piñera announced that the capacity of the stadium will be increased so as to reach 70,000 seats for the 2014 South American Games that will take place in Santiago. The works are expected to begin in 2012.\n\nOn June 3, 2011 further renovation plans were announced by the government. The complete area surrounding the stadium will be turned into a park to be called \"Citizenry Park\" (\"Parque de la Ciudadanía\"). Over 70% of the new 64-hectare park will consist of green areas, and the rest will include new infrastructure such as a lagoon or restaurants. The new park is expected to be ready for the 2014 games. New sporting venues will be built for the 2014 games, such as two modern gymnasiums, a new heated pool for synchronized swimming, a renovated velodrome and an expanded CAR, which will also serve as residence of the future Ministry of Sports. The only venues that will remain are the stadium, the main tennis court, the velodrome, the CAR, the athletics track, the skating track, the hockey field and the \"caracolas\".\n\nThe highest attendance for a match at Estadio Nacional to date is 85,268, for a match played on December 29, 1962; Universidad de Chile defeated Universidad Catolica 4–1. In the 2016–17 season, Universidad de Chile drew an average home league attendance of 30,041 for the Apertura and 33,466 for the Clausura.\n\nThe stadium hosts many international, and two national (Los Prisioneros), concerts during the year. Rod Stewart was the first international artist to perform at the stadium. The concert brought more than 200,000 fans to the venue and was broadcast throughout the country. After that, the city started being included in many tours from international artists.\n\nThe Following is a list of concerts, showing date, artist or band, tour, opening acts and attendance.\n\nNotes\n\nThe stadium was built with an original capacity of 48,000 spectators in 1937. At the time, some considered it a \"white elephant\" because it was thought that it could never be filled. The term also alluded to the charges of corruption against the administration of Arturo Alessandri, which oversaw the stadium's costly construction.\n\nFor the 1962 FIFA World Cup, seating capacity was increased to 74,000 with overflow areas allowing for a total of more than 80,000 people, by eliminating the cycling track that was moved to another location. Over the years, seating capacity was reduced to keep escape routes clear and prevent accidents.\n\nFor the 2000 World Junior Championships in Athletics, the installation of individual seats was required, which reduced capacity to 66,000 spectators. This requirement ensured that the stadium could not exceed capacity, as seen with the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1987 (believed to be attended by more than 90,000 people, though no accurate measurement could be taken as attendance was free, with no control), or the closing of the Telethon. The official capacity of the stadium as of 2014 is 48,665.\n\n"}

The EuroLeague is the top-tier level European-wide men's professional club basketball league in Europe. The award has existed and been awarded by the EuroLeague since the 2004–05 season. It was originally awarded for play that included the league's regular season, top 16 stage, and playoffs, and currently is awarded for play that includes the regular season and playoffs, as the top 16 stage was eliminated.\n\nSo far, Anthony Parker is the only player who has won the award twice. Other than Parker, all the other winners of the award have been Europeans, with Luka Dončić being the most recent (and youngest) winner of the award for 2018.\n\nThe EuroLeague MVP award is the first and only full season MVP award that is voted on and given by the EuroLeague. Previous awards like the EuroLeague Regular Season and Top 16 MVP awards were only for individual phases of the season, with the original regular season MVP award being based on the PIR stat, rather than on an actual voting process. When the EuroLeague Full Season MVP award was created, those previous awards were phased out altogether, and were replaced by the EuroLeague MVP of the Month award.\n\nThe EuroLeague MVP award is based on a voting process. Currently, online fan voting represents 25% of the vote total for the MVP award, while media voting accounts for the remaining 75%. Team success is unofficially paramount during the selection process. Since established, the award has never gone to a player whose team did not reach the EuroLeague Final Four. It is nevertheless theoretically possible for that to occur in the future, as no rule stands against it. For example, players whose teams only made it to the top 16 stage of the competition (when it existed in the past), were nominated into the online fan voting every year, and some were selected to the All-EuroLeague First Team.\n\nStarting with the 2004–05 season, the EuroLeague officially began giving out its Full Season MVP award for the first time. Unlike the previous EuroLeague Regular Season and Top 16 MVP awards, this award encompasses the full season of EuroLeague, up until the EuroLeague Final Four stage. Also, rather than being based on the PIR statistical formula, like the earlier EuroLeague Regular Season MVP award, the Full Season MVP award is based on a combination of online voting by fans and the media. The online fan vote comprises 25% of the vote total, while the media vote encompasses 75% of the vote total.\n\n\n"}

Players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles into the hoop in single-player, local multiplayer, and asynchronous HORSE-style online multiplayer modes. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases. Development began in mid 2011 following Mikengreg's successful \"Solipskier\". They were able to live from the earnings for \"Gasketball\" two year development at their previous salary, which afforded them the stability to try new avenues and reject prototypes, though they worked 100-hour weeks. Towards the end of their development, they ran out of money and lived on the couches of friends. It was released on August 9, 2012, and the game did not reach their desired conversion rate at the time of launch.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. \"Pocket Gamer\" gave the game their silver award, and Tim Rogers of \"Kotaku\" named \"Gasketball\" his 2012 game of the year, calling it \"the beginning of the hardcore social game genre\".\n\n\"Gasketball\" is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports video game where players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces before making the basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop before moving to the next level shamefully. Players are awarded medals for the quality of their performance at the end of each chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. Every chapter has a unique theme, such as a construction site or outer space.\n\nThe game has local two-player multiplayer with a divided iPad screen, and asynchronous online multiplayer where players construct levels for their opponents to complete. Players spin a wheel at the beginning of their turn to determine how many hazards they get to place via drag and drop. A few of the items are unlocked at first, and more are available with progress through the game or in-app purchases. \"Gasketball\" uses a colorful palette and features a cranky robot, who provides a tutorial and resets the ball. It was released as free-to-play with the tutorial unlocked, and four to five chapters available as additional paid downloads.\n\n\"Gasketball\" was developed and produced by Mikengreg, an Iowa-based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. After releasing their first game, the sport-inspired \"Solipskier\" for iPhone and iPad, Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on \"Gasketball\", paying themselves their same salaries from their Adobe Flash development days but having the security to try new ideas. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as \"Puzzlejuice\" with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Development began in mid 2011. Even though \"Solipskier\" was successful, the duo did not have a following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living on the \"Solipskier\" funds. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living on the couches of friends.\n\nIn making \"Gasketball\", Boxleiter and Wohlwend felt that their game quality had been improving over time, though designing for a million-person audience was \"daunting\" and Wohlwend questioned whether he could even recreate \"Solipskier\" success. The former game was designed in fits of creativity while the latter had no such moments, and took longer to produce. They discarded \"everything\" multiple times during their prototyping process with the understanding that anything less than what they wanted would lead to a subpar end result. Boxleiter had difficulty accepting praise towards the end of development, considering the weight of having to leave the industry if the many 100-hour weeks did not pan out in an accepted product.\n\nMikengreg first announced the game on March 1, 2012, and it was later released for iPad on August 9, 2012. Mikengreg decided to release the game as free-to-play for the base game with in-app purchases for the extended content. Wohlwend saw that a quarter of the top grossing games on iOS used in-app purchases (albeit with predatory practices) and felt that they could follow the model with a more ethical strategy: free to play, but pay once to unlock forever. Wohlwend later remarked that, \"So far, humanity is proving to us that we can't have it both ways.\" They were told by friends that the purchase function was too hidden, which they later fixed. Journalists had noted the difficulty in purchasing the full version as well. \"Gasketball\" had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near the top of an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart. The game's conversion rate from its free-to-play base package to the paid version was 0.67%—lower than their goal of at least 2% of an estimated five million downloads. The paid addition includes 100 additional levels and 10 new objects.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers noted the game's character and creative vision. \"Pocket Gamer\" gave the game their silver award. \"Gasketball\" was Tim Rogers of \"Kotaku\" 2012 game of the year.\n\n\"Edge\" noted Mikengreg's deft ability with simple sound effects, citing their previous work with \"Solipskier\". They praised the \"sweet and personable\" art design and the mix of \"freewheeling creativity with arcade precision\". \"Edge\" also praised the addition of the \"decent\" single-player campaign alongside the multiplayer. \"Pocket Gamer\" Harry Slater called the single-player \"entertaining\" but felt the asynchronous multiplayer was the highlight. \"TouchArcade\" Brad Nicholson called the game a cross between \"Amazing Alex\" and \"NBA Jam\". While he found some puzzle designs imbalanced, Nicholson also felt that the interactions between the flipper and portal hazards were \"surprisingly solid\" and noted the game's lighthearted \"welcome playground sort of feel\" even as the easy learning curve reached Rube Goldberg-like complexity. Tim Rogers of \"Kotaku\" called \"Gasketball\" the \"inverse Rube Goldberg\" and \"the beginning of the hardcore social game genre, of asynchronous gameplay as meaningful as FPS deathmatches\".\n\n\n"}

Kickers was bought in 2007 by the Royer group.\n\nOn the French scene in 1970, Daniel Raufast came across a poster advertising the musical \"Hair\". Interested by all the barefooted youngsters wearing jeans, he developed a new shoe concept which he believed to be more compatible with the blue-jean generation. The designer Jacques Chevallereau then created the first 'jean boot'. This new shoe was very different: the use of nubuck; shapes that looked more like short boots than regular shoes; tough crepe soles made with natural rubber, eyelets, contrast stitching, panels and appliqués all obviously referencing denim. The success was such that, within one season, Kickers production capacity grew from 300 to 12,000 pairs per month. Immediately successful in France, then Germany, by 1974, Kickers were selling in over 70 countries.\n\nDuring the 1980s Kickers shoes become very successful in Britain. So much so in some case, children were queuing up until 10 o'clock at night waiting upon deliveries, and when the delivery did arrive the stock would be gone in a flash. Many children also collected the \"flower shape\" tag and did not believe the shoes were real Kickers unless this tag was included.\n\nThe Kick Hi boot was released in 1975.\n\nIt was in the late 1980s and early 1990s that Kickers really gained popularity when Kick His were heralded by icons on the Manchester music scene. The Kick Hi then became popular in the rave scene, first with acid house and then later with trance music. Many fans of the shoe came from diverse and contemporary musical backgrounds including UK garage, RnB, pop and hip hop.\n\nOver the years, Kickers has been associated with the music industry, including Ms Dynamite, So Solid Crew, Jarvis Cocker, Noel Gallagher, Mike Skinner, Arctic Monkeys, Craig David and Rodney P. \n\nIan Brown famously kicked off the trend by wearing a pair of Kick His to The Haçienda as a cheeky retort to the strict 'no trainer policy'. The Stone Roses wore them in their video for 'Fools Gold'. A sheep sported a pair of Kick His on the cover of the 'Stepping Stone' 12-inch single by \"The Farm\".\n\nKickers sponsored the Urban Music Awards (UMA) 2007 and had an advertorial with NME which ended in September 2007.\n\n"}

This farmhouse, which dates back to the 19th century, is believed by football historians to be the oldest existing football stadium building in the world. The changing rooms were closed in 2013 for safety reasons.\n\nDuring World War II, Lesser Hampden was commandeered by the British Government to serve as a base for the Home Guard. There were proposals to convert the site back to agriculture if there were food shortages, but the ground was returned to the football club at the end of the war in 1945.\n\nDuring the 1970s, several Queen's Park first team games were played at the stadium. During the redevelopment of the main Hampden Park stadium in the 1990s, the club played Scottish Football League matches at this ground. In 2002, it was discovered that Lesser Hampden was tainted with toxic chromium, a byproduct from an old chemicals plant located in nearby Rutherglen. This was cleaned up at a cost of around £40,000. The ground served as a staging area for pre-game tailgate parties hosted by the Scottish Claymores American football team when they played at Hampden Park.\n\nLesser Hampden is now tightly hemmed in by surrounding housing and commercial developments. It has some areas of terracing, floodlights and a small covered grandstand adjacent to the original farmhouse building. The natural grass pitch was replaced with a 3rd generation astro-grass pitch, and was used as a warm-up area for athletes competing in the 2014 Commonwealth Games, as the track and field events were held at Hampden Park.\n\nIn September 2018 it was announced that Queen's Park would return to Lesser Hampden to play first team matches on a permanent basis after agreeing to sell Hampden Park itself to the Scottish FA, who had been leasing the larger ground as the base for the national team.\n"}

It can be done on either inside or outside edges. \n\nThe most common mohawk turn is the forward inside open mohawk. In this turn, the skater faces into the circle and the free foot is brought to the instep of the skating foot at an angle of 90° or more, before being placed on the ice on a backward inside edge during the transfer of weight. This leaves the former skating foot (and new free foot) in front of the new skating foot after the turn. Along with the 3 turn, this is the most common way for skaters to change direction while skating, and is one of the first turns learned by beginning skaters.\n\nIn a closed mohawk, the transfer of weight happens with the free foot being placed behind the skating foot rather than at the instep, so that after the turn the new free foot is carried behind rather than in front. \n\nOutside mohawks are similar, except that the skater faces outside of the circle. Again, there are both open and closed variants. \n\nMohawk turns are essentially executed with crossed feet, and this is reflected in the tracings. In a good mohawk turn, the weight transfer is executed smoothly, without jerking of the hips or upper body. It is somewhat easier to accomplish this if the skater has open hip joints and can turn out the free foot at a greater angle before placing it on the ice, but lack of flexibility can be compensated for with careful timing.\n\nThe corresponding turns from backward to forward do not involve crossed feet and are usually considered simple steps rather than mohawks.\n"}

{"id": "3554596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3554596", "title": "Quarterback kneel", "text": "Quarterback kneel\n\nIn American football, a quarterback kneel, also called taking a knee, genuflect offense, or victory formation occurs when the quarterback immediately kneels to the ground, ending the play on contact, after receiving the snap. It is primarily used to run the clock down, either at the end of the first half or the game itself, in order to preserve a lead or a win. Although it generally results in a loss of a yard and uses up a down, it minimizes the risk of a fumble, which would give the other team a chance at recovering the ball.\n\nEspecially when the outcome of the game has been well decided, defenses will often give little resistance to the play as a matter of sportsmanship as well as to reduce the risk of injuries, penalties and possible supplemental discipline (the latter considerations being increasingly important as referees and leagues more strictly enforce penalties against perceived unnecessary roughness on quarterbacks and against headshots in general) on what is a relatively simple play. The quarterback is generally not touched and the act of intentionally taking the knee results in the play being over in all variations of the sport.\n\nThe formation offers maximum protection against a fumble; should the center-quarterback exchange result in a fumble, a running back is lined up on either side of the quarterback, both to recover any fumble and protect the vulnerable kneeling player from being injured by defensive players who get through the line. Also, a player is lined up directly behind the quarterback, often much farther than a typical tailback would line up. This player's responsibility is to tackle any defensive player who may recover a fumble and attempt to advance it. Because of this essentially \"defensive\" responsibility, the tailback in this formation may actually be a free safety or other defensive player who is adept at making tackles in the open field.\n\nEven though the play itself takes very little time, the rules of American football dictate that it does not stop the game clock (as with any play where the ball carrier is tackled in bounds). With the 40-second play clock in the NFL and NCAA, along with the two-minute warning in the NFL, a team can run off over two minutes with three straight kneel-downs if the defensive team has no more timeouts. The winning team can storm the field if up to 40 seconds remains in the game (30 in Alliance of American Football), to let coaches shake hands with each other. (In the AAF, as many as three straight \"victory formations\" from 90 seconds left in regulation can be done.)\n\nThe play is often known as a \"victory formation\", as it is most often run by a winning team late in the game in order to preserve a victory. In the case of a close game, the winning team would be trying to avoid a turnover which might be the result of a more complex play. In the case of a more lopsided contest where the winning team's overall point differential has no prospect of affecting their playoff qualification prospects, the play can be run as a matter of sportsmanship (since the winning team foregoes the opportunity to run up the score) and to avoid further injuries and/or penalties. In terms of statistics, a kneel by the quarterback is typically recorded as a rushing attempt for −1 or −2 yards.\n\nOther sports also use the term \"victory formation\" for a play designed only to run down the clock with little chance of injury, such as a Jammer in roller derby skating behind or only lightly challenging the pack while the final seconds of the bout tick down.\n\nThe quarterback kneel is mainly used when the team in the lead has possession of the ball with less than two minutes on the game clock. With the 40-second play clock in the NFL and NCAA, two minutes (120 seconds) is in theory the maximum amount of time that can be run off on three consecutive quarterback kneels; this assumes it is first down and the defense has no timeouts remaining. A team cannot run more than three consecutive quarterback kneels as doing so on fourth down turns the ball over to the opponent and guarantees them at least one opportunity to score. The decision to run the quarterback kneel depends on the amount of time remaining in the game, the down, and the number of timeouts the defense has remaining. For example, if there is one minute remaining on the game clock on first down, and the defense has one timeout left, the offense may use two successive quarterback kneels to completely run out the clock, and if the defense uses its timeout the offense can simply run a third kneel to run out the clock. However, if there is one minute remaining on the game clock on \"third\" down, then regardless of how many timeouts the defense has, quarterback kneels will not completely run out the clock and the offense must try to make a first down. AAF allows this to happen if up to 90 seconds remain; there's a 30-second play clock.\n\nThe quarterback kneel is also often used at the end of the first half by a team which feels they have little chance of scoring before halftime due to poor field position. It is also sometimes run at the end of the second half of a tie game by a team content with sending the game into overtime. Less commonly, the play is sometimes run at the end of the game by a losing team which is hopelessly behind and wishes to avoid injury, but is unwilling to cut the game short by forfeiting. \n\nA team that is in field-goal range and either tied on the score or trailing by 1 or 2 points can also use one or more kneeldowns in order to run time off the clock before attempting a field goal. A quarterback in this situation may also run several yards to his left or right before kneeling down in order to get a more favorable spot for the field goal attempt, in order to try and get the ball closer to the goal line and/or to get the ball to a particular set of hash marks if the team's kicker prefers to kick from a specific side of the field. Ideally, the clock would run out during the field goal attempt, thereby preventing the opposing team from getting an opportunity to score again.\n\nIn several instances (including twice by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2017 NFL season), a quarterback kneel has been purposefully initiated on a point after touchdown try at the end of the game after a game-winning or defensive touchdown was scored at the end of regulation; NFL rules used to require the try to be executed between the offense and defense, even if the offense intends to decline the unnecessary points to avoid further insulting or annoying their opponent. This occurred prominently in the 2018 \"Minneapolis Miracle\", where eight New Orleans Saints players on offense and defense had to return to the field from the locker room to 'oppose' the try against the victorious Minnesota Vikings after referee imploration to complete the try. Quarterback Case Keenum merely knelt the ball down before tossing it in the air and celebrating the Viking victory, with the Saints giving no effort to strip the ball (as a defensive runback for a two-point conversion would not have assured a tie or victory). The rule was changed for 2018 onward, to omit the try if it would have no impact on the outcome of the game. \n\nIn rare instances, a team will use the quarterback kneel to avoid running up the score in a lopsided contest, even though there may be significant time remaining on the clock. This occurred in the 2011 edition of the Magnolia Bowl between the LSU Tigers and Ole Miss Rebels. With five minutes remaining and LSU leading 52–3, Tigers' head coach Les Miles ordered third-string quarterback Zach Mettenberger to kneel on first and goal from the Ole Miss one-yard line, and to kneel on the next three plays. Miles felt another touchdown would further embarrass Ole Miss coach Houston Nutt, who announced his resignation, effective at the end of the season, 12 days before the Rebels hosted first-ranked LSU. The Tigers had already secured the largest margin of victory in series history.\n\nIn Canadian football, which use slightly different rules, kneeling with time left is not necessarily a viable strategy. Unlike in American football, in Canadian football every quarter must end with a play even in situations where the game clock expires after the end of the previous play. However, a quarterback kneel is by far the most common play for winning teams to run with \"zeros on the clock\" at the end of a game, barring exceptional (but not unheard-of) situations where the head-to-head point differential in the opposing teams' season series (a key factor in tiebreakers) remains in doubt.\n\nPrior to the mid-1970s, teams leading in the final moments of games generally ran quarterback sneaks (which brought the risk of injuries on low-yardage plays) or dive plays to the fullbacks or other running backs to run time off the clock, as some coaches considered kneeling cowardly or even unsportsmanlike. However, the Miracle at the Meadowlands, on November 19, , in which defensive back Herman Edwards of the visiting Philadelphia Eagles recovered a botched handoff between quarterback Joe Pisarcik and running back Larry Csonka of the New York Giants, provided a nationally-televised spur for change. \n\nWith 31 seconds remaining, the Giants led 17–12 and the Eagles were out of timeouts. As Pisarcik attempted to hand it to Larry Csonka, it was awkwardly fumbled; Edwards scooped it up and ran it 26 yards for the Eagles' improbable The play generated tremendous controversy, ridicule, and criticism toward the Giants nationwide and specifically offensive coordinator Bob Gibson for failing to use the supposedly foolproof quarterback-kneeldown play.\n\nIn the week following the game, both the Eagles and Giants developed specific formations designed to protect the quarterback behind three players as he fell on the ball. Previously, quarterbacks executing a similar \"kill the clock\" play simply ran a quarterback sneak from a tightly packed conventional offensive formation. The Eagles made the playoffs and the Giants finished at \n\nThe \"victory formation\" spread rapidly throughout football at nearly all levels, as coaches sought to adopt a procedure for downing the ball in the final seconds which would reduce the risk of turnovers to the absolute minimum possible. Within a season or so, it had become nearly universal. In 1987 the NFL rule allowing quarterbacks to simply kneel and not have to fall down and risk a hit from the defense took effect.\n\nAlthough in most instances a losing team will concede defeat when the other team is in the victory formation and taking the quarterback kneel, there are instances where the trailing team will try to make a defensive play in an attempt to regain possession of the ball, particularly when the losing team is behind by a touchdown or less and there is enough time to make more than one play.\nThis had happened on the play preceding The Miracle at the Meadowlands. Due to the low percentage of turnovers caused, defenses generally do not attempt to disrupt the kneeldown as the Eagles did in 1978; a \"gentlemen's agreement\" emerged in which defenders did not rush the offensive team with high intensity, as long as the offense made no attempt to advance the ball.\n\nOne prominent exception occurred to another Giants quarterback in 2012. In Week 2, an interception of a Tampa Bay Buccaneers pass with six seconds left had apparently secured a 25-point fourth-quarter comeback and 41–34 Giant victory. However, in the ensuing \"victory formation\" play, instead of the usual nominal contact between the lineman, the Buccaneers stacked the line of scrimmage and forcefully pushed the Giants' line back in an attempt to cause Giants' QB Eli Manning to fumble. Manning was knocked back by his own center as he took the snap and fell down. Giants coach Tom Coughlin angrily confronted his Tampa Bay counterpart, Greg Schiano, at midfield once the game was over. Undaunted, Schiano employed a similar strategy the next week at the end of the Buccaneers' game against the Dallas Cowboys. In the next season, with the Philadelphia Eagles leading the Buccaneers, Chip Kelly had quarterback Nick Foles attempt a shotgun formation kneeldown to avert Schiano's aggressive technique, which succeeded.\n\nAside from trying to attempt a defensive play, teams that are losing but behind by a touchdown or less in the final two minutes will sometimes use their time-outs if the team does a quarterback kneel. As teams are allowed three time-outs per half—the clock stops on a time out and restarts on the snap—they will try to preserve them for situations such as this, thereby forcing the winning team to run a play and gain a first down or, in the very least, take time off the clock. \n\nIf there is still enough time left on the clock and the winning team attempts another quarterback kneel, the defensive team's strategy may repeat itself until it either runs out of time-outs, time runs out, or (most desirably) the team forces a punt or turnover, though in 2016, the Baltimore Ravens, leading in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals after three plays, ran off the remaining twelve seconds of clock off in a punt formation with Sam Koch purposefully holding the ball in the end zone while multiple holding calls were made against the Ravens offense. The play ended with Koch touching his toe to the back end zone line after time expired and taking an intentional safety (offensive fouls at the end of the game do not result in a replay of a down, unlike their defensive equivalents). The intentional holding aspect of the play was made illegal after the 2016 NFL season.\n\nThe 2011 NFL Rules state in Rule 7, Section 2, Article 1(c): \"An official shall declare the ball dead and the down ended … when a quarterback immediately drops to his knee (or simulates dropping to his knee) behind the line of scrimmage\".\n\nThe 2011 and 2012 NCAA Rules state in Rule 4, Section 1, Article 3(o): \"A live ball becomes dead and an official shall sound his whistle or declare it dead … When a ball carrier simulates placing his knee on the ground.\" The same rule is used by the British American Football Association.\n\nThe 2011 CFL Rules state in Rule 1, Section 4: \"The ball is dead … When the quarterback, in possession of the ball, intentionally kneels on the ground during the last three minutes of a half\".

{"id": "29598951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29598951", "title": "Roll (gymnastics)", "text": "Roll (gymnastics)\n\nA roll is the most basic and fundamental skill in gymnastics. There are many variations in the skill. Rolls are similar to flips in the fact that they are a complete rotation of the body, but the rotation of the roll is usually made on the ground while a flip is made in the air with the hips passing over the head and without any hands touching the ground. Rolls also help recover from a fall safely.\n\nThe forward roll (colloquially called a roly poly) is one of the most basic elements in gymnastics and one of the first learnt. The forward roll is started from a standing position and then the gymnast crouches down, places their hands shoulder wide apart and hands facing forward. They tuck their chin to their chest and place the back of their head onto the floor. They then push off of the floor with their legs and rotate over their head onto their back. The gymnast then presses their feet onto the floor and whips the arms forward to stand up.\nThe backward roll is similar to the forward roll, but in reverse. The gymnast starts in a standing position and bends to a squat/sitting position with their arms in front. They then lower and lean back slightly until their bottom reaches the floor. They then continue this momentum and roll over their back onto their shoulders. They should then place their hands next to their shoulders and tuck their head into their chin. The hands then push the floor strongly and straighten their arms and continue to rotate their body over their head. The feet are then placed on the floor and the gymnast stands.\n\nVariations:\n\nA sideways roll is also known as a log roll, barrel roll, or pencil roll. This can be started by lying down on the back or front with the body outstretched. The gymnast then rolls onto their side and does a complete rotation of the body, remaining parallel to the performing surface. The log roll is a sideways roll with the hands next to the waist and the pencil roll is with the hands stretched above the head. A sideways roll can also be performed when a gymnast over-rotates or loses their balance in a vertical, forward or sideways direction.\n\nA Tucked Sideways roll begins with the gymnast starting in a kneeling position, with the gymnast sitting back onto their heels with their head and arms in an outstretched position like the child pose in yoga. From here, the gymnast rolls onto their side with their legs maintaining the tucked position and onto their knees again.\n\nThis roll starts by sitting on the floor in a straddle position. The legs are held below the knees and the body leans over towards the shoulder on one side. The gymnast then folds more tightly until they roll over their back and return to a sitting straddle position.\n\nA dive roll is an acrobatic stunt that begins with a horizontal forward diving motion and results in a forward roll. Alternate forms such as a Jigaree are also notable. It is considered an advanced forward roll, demonstrating flight and a smooth landing. It is also used in other sports such as wrestling to reinforce the motion of landing correctly.\n"}

His performances in the international scene caught the eye of Mick Jones who drafted him into the Brunei M-League squad in 2001. He scarcely played for the Wasps due to work commitments and his preference to play at domestic club level for Brunei DPMM FC who signed him in 2003. He won the Brunei Premier League in 2004. His solitary goal for Brunei came in a 1–1 draw against Kedah on 20 March 2005.\n\nA year later, Rosmini's club moved to the Malaysia Premier League for the 2005–06 season to replace Brunei. DPMM immediately won promotion, and in the following season, finished third in Malaysia's top tier. Unfortunately, he was axed along with Affendy Akup and Zulkefly Duraman to make way for four Malaysian players in the 2007–08 Malaysia Super League.\n\nRosmini joined newly formed AM Gunners in the 2008 Brunei Premier Two and became league champions, gaining promotion to the top flight. AM Gunners left the Bruneian football league system in 2011 after two seasons. Rosmini next moved to and captained a reformed MS PDB, returning to his first club in some ways. After a two-season hiatus, he re-appeared for the Policemen in the 2017 season.\n\nRosmini made his international debut for Brunei at the 2002 World Cup qualifying round for Asia in a 0-5 loss against Yemen, coming on to replace fellow policeman Jasriman Johari on 7 April 2001. He started the rest of the qualifying matches as Brunei completed six games without scoring a goal. Brunei subsequently refused to take part in World Cup qualifying until the 2018 tournament.\n\nRosmini also played two games for the Brunei under-23s at the 21st SEA Games held in Malaysia in September 2001.\n\n"}

{"id": "1630694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1630694", "title": "Umbro", "text": "Umbro\n\nUmbro is an English sportswear and football equipment supplier based in Cheadle, next to Manchester, England. Umbro designs, sources, and markets football-related apparel, footwear, and equipment. Its products are sold in over 90 countries worldwide. Since 2012, the company has been a subsidiary of American company Iconix Brand Group.\n\nThe company was founded by Harold Humphreys, along with his brother Wallace in a small workshop in Wilmslow, Cheshire, inspired by the growing interest in football witnessed nationwide. The name \"Umbro\" is a quasi-portmanteau inspired by Humphreys Brothers Clothing. Umbro's kit debut was in the 1934 FA Cup final, when both teams Manchester City and Portsmouth wore kits designed and manufactured by the company. Other teams supplied by Umbro during the 1930s and 1940s were Sheffield United, Preston North End, Manchester United and Blackpool.\n\nUmbro was the official sports manufacturer of the English FA Cup and official sponsor of The FA, being the exclusive supplier of balls to the body's leagues.\n\nIn 1952, the British team at the Summer Olympics wore Umbro kits, tailored for the needs of their individual sports. Umbro would supply kits for the British Olympics team for the next 20 years.\n\nIn 1957, Umbro entered the tennis market, producing sports clothing in collaboration with player Ted Tinling. This collaboration extended for three decades. Another sportsman who collaborated with Umbro was Manchester United manager Matt Busby, in 1959. That same year the company started to sell its junior boys' kits, a set of shirt, shorts and socks that would allow young players to wear the same look as their footballing idols.\n\nBrazil became the first FIFA World Cup champion to wear kits by Umbro in 1958. Two years later, Manchester United Scottish player Denis Law signed an exclusive agreement with the brand, becoming the first footballer to be sponsored by Umbro. The England national team won its only title in 1966 wearing kits by Umbro (the deal had been signed in 1954). Of the 16 teams that competed, 15 wore kit manufactured by Umbro, the only exception being the USSR. At the same time, 85% of British football teams wore kits by the company, including Celtic, the first British team to win a European Cup in 1967. Liverpool FC won the first four of their five European Cups while wearing Umbro kits, in 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1984.\n\nIn 1974, Umbro's founder, Harold Humphreys, died. His sons John and Stuart took over the running of the company. The England national team wore Umbro shirts by choice until 1974, when The Football Association, encouraged by the England manager Don Revie, sold the jersey manufacturing rights to Admiral Sportswear.\n\nAfter more than a decade wearing Admiral kits, the England national team signed with Umbro again in 1984. In 1986, Umbro began to manufacture its own football boots. The company added footballers Alan Shearer and Michael Owen (who was only 14 years old) to its list of sponsored athletes. In 1994, Brazil won its fourth FIFA World Cup title in the United States and club teams AFC Ajax (in 1995), and Manchester United (in 1999) obtained the UEFA Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup, in Tokyo, all of them wearing Umbro kits.\n\nIn the United States, Umbro was the majority owner (94%) of United Soccer Leagues, the parent organization for North America's lower division men's soccer (tiers two through four in the American Soccer Pyramid), and the second tier women's league (W-League) and youth league (Super Y-League). During the 2009 USL First Division season, the Carolina RailHawks, Charleston Battery, Vancouver Whitecaps, Rochester Rhinos, Austin Aztex, and Puerto Rico Islanders all wore Umbro kits. During the 2012 USLPro season, the Dayton Dutch Lions wore Umbro.\n\nIn October 2007, JJB Sports bought a 10.1% stake in Umbro in a move to protect its stake in the market for England football shirts.\n\nOn 23 October 2007, it was announced Umbro had agreed to be bought by Nike in a deal worth , the equivalent of 193p per share. The Umbro board recommended to its shareholders they vote in favour of the approach, as it offered a very competitive price for the business. Umbro's share price at the time of the offer was close to 130p. The deal was approved by regulators in December 2007 and concluded in February 2008. With the objective of revitalising the brand, Umbro launched the \"Tailored by England\" lines. As of 4 June 2009, Umbro signed a deal with Manchester City to supply kits for the team. Wearing Umbro kits, Manchester City won its first championship in 34 years.\n\nIn 2010, Umbro became sponsor of reformed American team New York Cosmos to be its exclusive kit supplier.\n\nIn May 2012, Nike reported that they would be selling Umbro (along with Cole Haan) in order to focus on their sports brands, including Nike, Converse, Hurley and Air Jordan. In September 2012, The FA announced that future England kits would be manufactured by Nike.\n\nOn October 2012, Nike announced that it had agreed with Iconix Brand Group to sell Umbro for US$225 million. The acquisition was completed in December 2012.\n\nIn February 2014, it was announced that Umbro would supply Everton from the start of the 2014–15 football season. This was the first new club announcement since Iconix Brand Group bought Umbro, and was followed by the announcement of similar deals with Hull City and French clubs Lens and Nantes. On 9 June 2014, Derby County announced that their kits for the 2014–15 season would be made by Umbro.\n\nLater in 2014, Umbro announced deals to supply a number of teams, including the Serbian national football team, the Malawi national football team, Vasco da Gama and Grêmio.\n\nIn February 2015, Dutch Eredivisie champions PSV announced a new kit deal with Umbro, replacing PSV's previous deal with Nike, which had been in existence since 1994. The deal coincided with PSV's return to the UEFA Champions League after a six-year absence.\n\nIn late April 2015, West Ham United announced a new five-year agreement with Umbro as the club's official technical partner. This agreement included creating a commemorative kit for the Hammers' final year in the historic Boleyn Ground.\n\nIn early December 2015, German club 1. FC Nürnberg announced a long-term kit deal with Umbro as the club's official kit supplier, replacing Adidas.\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that Umbro had become the technical sponsor of Blackburn Rovers in a five-year deal. And would also return to making A.F.C. Bournemouth kit after two separate occasions in the 70’s and 80’s for the 2017-18 season.\n\nIn June 2017, seven-times German Champion FC Schalke 04 announced a five-year deal with Umbro replacing Adidas after 55 years.\n\nUmbro currently focuses on football equipment, such as kit uniforms (jerseys, shorts and socks), goalkeeper gloves, balls and boots, apart of manufacturing other apparel such as t-shirts and jackets.\n\nUntil the mid-1980s, the company manufactured only sports clothing, in particular football jerseys, shorts and socks, but had no footwear range. Eventually, in 1985, Umbro decided to introduce its first football boot into the Brazilian market. This design, cheaper than the products of existing boot brands such as Adidas, proved popular and went into mass production internationally two years later.\n\nUmbro also manufactured a popular style of shorts that reached its peak in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were made of nylon, had a drawstring waistband, and often came in bright colours. With the growth of youth soccer leagues in the U.S. in the 1980s, many youths, teens and young adults began wearing them as everyday clothing. At the height of the \"Umbro fashion,\" other brands of soccer shorts, such as Adidas, Diadora, Hummel, Lotto and Mitre, also became popular. Its major competitors in this market include Reebok, Nike, Adidas, Puma and fellow italian manufacturer Lotto.\n\nOther releases by Umbro include the Stealth boot, released in 2010 and worn by players such as Gaël Clichy and Phil Jagielka. The same year, the company released the GT, worn by then-Fulham striker Darren Bent. The company announced it as \"its lightest ever boot.\" This was succeeded by the GT II model. June 2011 saw the release of the Umbro Geometra Pro. In 2013, Umbro introduced to a new wave of releases that included the Speciali IV and the Geometra II.\n\nFollowing the purchase of the brand by Iconix Brand Group in 2013, the first major product release from Umbro was the UX-1, a technologically advanced football boot which was voted as one of the best new releases of the year.\n\nUmbro is the official supplier and sponsor of numerous association football teams, players and associations, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The stadium was originally called the \"Estadio Manzanares\", but this was later changed to the Vicente Calderón Stadium, in honour of their long-term President Vicente Calderón.\n\nTo finance the new stadium, Atlético Madrid had to make a debt issue in 1958 in the form of mortgage bonds that were underwritten mostly by club shareholders and members. On 17 March 1961, Javier Barroso bought land for the construction of a new stadium, to replace the Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid. In the same year, work began on the new stadium. The ground opened in 1966, and was named the Estadio del Manzanares until 1972.\n\nA notable and rather spectacular feature of the Vicente Calderón is that the M-30 dual carriageway, running from the South Node Toledo Bridge, passes below one of the main stands.\n\nOn 30 July 2007, Atlético Madrid, Mahou brewery and Ayuntamiento de Madrid signed an agreement to reclassify the land that is currently occupied by the Vicente Calderón stadium and the Mahou brewery, agreeing that Atlético would move within three years to the Estadio Olímpico de Madrid, better known as Estadio La Peineta (officially Wanda Metropolitano), which was to be renovated in preparation for Atlético's tenancy. After reconstruction, La Peineta holds 67,000 spectators and features fully covered stands. The Vicente Calderón Stadium is soon to be demolished, and a park will be built in its place, which is to be named the 'Park Atlético Madrid'. Atlético then moved to La Peineta in the 2017-18 season.\n\nThe decision to demolish the stadium was not well received by some of the Atlético fans who were against the relocation of the club, as they considered it to be a bad move if money was not being used to improve the club itself. The protests were led by the Save the Calderon Group and the Atlético Supporters Club: Asociación Señales de Humo.\n\nThe Estadio Vicente Calderón is located on the banks of the Manzanares.\n\nIn addition, the stadium can be accessed via the Madrid Metro. The closest stations are: Pirámides Station and Marqués de Vadillo Station, both of which are on Line 5 of the Madrid Metro.\n\nThe stadium hosted the final of the Copa del Rey (also previously known as the \"Copa del Generalísimo\") on 14 occasions:<br>\n1973 * 1974 * 1975 * 1977 * 1979 * 1981 * 1986 * 1989 * 1994 * 2005 * 2008 * 2012 * 2016 * 2017.\n\nVicente Calderón hosted eleven international matches of the Spanish national team.\nThe stadium hosted the group D three matches.
