It was named after brothers Bruce and Daniel Cameron, VMI Class of 1938 and 1942, respectively.\n\nBuilt in 1981, Cameron Hall was named after brothers Bruce B. Cameron, Jr. and Daniel D. Cameron from Wilmington, North Carolina. The Cameron brothers were both graduates of the school, as Bruce graduated in 1938 and Daniel in 1942. They paid for $2.3 million of the building's $6.8 million cost, with a supplementation from the Virginia General Assembly. The other funds were paid for by the VMI Foundation. For their contributions, the Cameron brothers were given life passes to all Cameron Hall events by VMI Board of Visitors president Vincent J. Thomas.

Locker rooms were also renovated, with new carpeting, paint, and a lounge. Four years later in 1999, a VMI \"Wall of Fame\" was added to the mezzanine level, which features photographs and trophies as a tribute to former VMI basketball players and members of the VMI Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2007, VMI installed a new court donated by Ralph Costen, a 1970 graduate of the school.

{"id": "476640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=476640", "title": "Celtic Pride", "text": "Celtic Pride\n\nCeltic Pride is a 1996 American comedy film written by Judd Apatow and Colin Quinn, and directed by Tom DeCerchio. It stars Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd as Mike O'Hara and Jimmy Flaherty, two passionate Boston Celtics fans, and Damon Wayans as Lewis Scott, the Utah Jazz's All-Star shooting guard.\n\nBest friends for life, gym teacher Mike O'Hara (Daniel Stern) and plumber Jimmy Flaherty (Dan Aykroyd) are united by their love of Boston and its sports teams, especially the Boston Celtics, who are playing their last season in the old Boston Garden. When the Celtics drop Game 6 of the NBA Finals to the Utah Jazz, setting up a deciding Game 7 in Boston, Mike and Jimmy find themselves depressed and hopeless. On top of all this, Mike has moved back in with Jimmy after his wife Carol, fed up with his unhealthy obsession with the Celtics, left him and took their son Tommy with her. Jimmy and Mike stumble upon the Jazz's selfish, one-man-show shooting guard Lewis Scott (Damon Wayans) at a Boston nightclub. Hoping at first to get him drunk enough so he'll be hungover for Game 7, Mike and Jimmy pose as Utah fans. This however leads to them running into their idol Larry Bird (as himself), who scolds them for being what he thinks are \"fair weather\" fans. However, the pair get more than they bargained for when the next morning they end up kidnapping Scott after he wakes up at Jimmy's apartment. The two decide to hold Scott until after the game, reasoning that if they are going to prison, they might as well help the Celtics win in the meantime.\n\nScott's streetwise, arrogant ways contrast with Jimmy and Mike's bumbling blue-collar lifestyle. He derides them for being washed-up losers, and insinuates Mike is only after him because he is jealous of Scott's fame and ability. Mike, on the other hand, berates Scott for his behavior on and off the court, including starring in a campy Oscar Mayer hot dog commercial and skipping practices. Scott attempts to turn Jimmy against Mike, and, when this fails, escapes, only to be foiled by an antagonistic cabbie and a local cop, Kevin (Paul Guilfoyle), both fellow Celtics fans. \nUltimately, Mike challenges Scott to a game of one-on-one and the pair is incapacitated well before the final game is set to begin. Before he runs off, Scott presents the pair with a dilemma, they must root for him and hope the Jazz win, otherwise he will turn them both in to the police. Mike reconciles with his wife and son, knowing he might be going to prison, and Jimmy says goodbye to his grandmother. At the game, the two convince the other Celtics fans they are only pretending to root for the Jazz, and the first half ends with the Celtics leading. Mike, who knows the Jazz are losing because Scott refuses to pass the ball, gives him a pep talk from the stands, and Utah closes the gap to one point with a little over 7 seconds remaining. With one play left and the Jazz with the ball, Mike and Jimmy choose life over the Celtics, rooting for Utah and rushing the court after they win. Approached by Kevin who earlier ignored his cries for help, Lewis denies Mike and Jimmy committed the kidnapping, saving them from prison.\n\nA few months later, Mike has promised his wife he would never interfere with an NBA Finals game again. But now it's football season. He and Jimmy sneak into the hotel room of Deion Sanders at 3:00 a.m.\n\n\nThe film was not a major success despite its star power, grossing less than $10 million domestically, and received very poor reviews, with a \"rotten\" rating of 9% on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nHal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote, \"\"Celtic Pride\" is clearly intended as a spoof on the contemporary mania for athletics. But not only is the picture woefully short on laughs, it's also coarse, overbearing and, in places, downright insulting\" while TV Guide said \"Celtic Pride supplies predictably lowbrow yocks for jocks, and its rather disturbing racial implications go entirely unacknowledged,\" and awarded it 1 and half stars out of five.\n\nHowever, in a rare, more positive review, Joe Leydon of Variety said \"\"Not quite a three-pointer, but definitely more than an airball, \"Celtic Pride\" is an uneven but largely likable basketball-themed comedy that should lay up decent B.O. numbers and perform even better in the homevid arena.\"\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1184821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1184821", "title": "Chicagoland Speedway", "text": "Chicagoland Speedway\n\nChicagoland Speedway is a tri-oval speedway in Joliet, Illinois, southwest of Chicago. The speedway opened in 2001 and used to host NASCAR racing including the opening event in the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs. Until 2011, the speedway also hosted the IndyCar Series, recording numerous close finishes including the closest finish in IndyCar history. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\n\nFirst discussions of building a major speedway near Chicago took place in an informal meeting between Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Tony George and International Speedway Corporation Chief Executive Officer Bill France, Jr. in late 1995. Together they formed The Motorsports Alliance, a joint company owned by Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corporation and International Speedway Corporation. By 1995, a major racing facility had been built or was near completion near Las Vegas, Los Angeles and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. The Chicago area was an untapped market for motorsports that had potential to be very lucrative. In 1996, the search began for a site to build a speedway somewhere near Chicago. Several sites were considered, and a track was built in suburban Cicero (Chicago Motor Speedway), but eventually attention turned to the Joliet area where George Barr had negotiated to build Route 66 Raceway. Barr convinced Joliet officials to meet with the Motorsports Alliance to discuss building their speedway adjacent to Route 66 Raceway. The success of Route 66 Raceway, completed in 1998, led to the city conducting an impact study of the proposed speedway. The study revealed the new speedway would generate $300 million for the Joliet and Will County region and over 3,000 jobs.\n\nThe Joliet city council unanimously approved the speedway on January 19, 1999. Following the approval, the Will County Board extended the Des Plaines River Valley Enterprise Zone in order to give a tax break to the speedway developers. The tax break news also led to the Joliet High School district threatening to bail out of the enterprise zone, but a compromise was reached. In May 1999, The Motorsports Alliance combined with Route 66 Raceway LLC to form Raceway Associates, LCC with Coyne as president alongside George and France.\n\nRaceway Associates revealed the track would be a d-shaped tri-oval superspeedway. Joie Chitwood III was named vice president and general manager of the facility. During the announcement, France stated the significance of the new speedway: \n\nArchitecture and engineering firm HNTB, which has built stadiums and arenas such as the RCA Dome, Los Angeles Coliseum and the Rose Bowl, was selected to lead the design of the facility. Construction management company Bovis Lend Lease headed the construction of the speedway. Construction started in August 1999, with groundbreaking September 28, 1999. On May 8, 2000, in a press conference on Chicago's Navy Pier, the track's name and inaugural events were announced. Construction of the speedway resulted in a few problems. In the summer of 2000, homes near the speedway were flooded as a result of heavy rains and run-off from excavation. In February 2001, a worker was killed after falling from the skybox suites on top of the grandstands. Construction was completed in spring 2001.\n\nThe track has seen little expansion since its construction, with the only major addition being the installation of lights around the track in 2008. Phase 1 of 4; phase 4 consists of a Bristol type seating capacity completely surrounding the speedway. The Indycar Series ran at the track since 2001, recording three of the top five closest finishes in Indycar history, including the closest in 2002. Despite the close finishes, the speedway announced IndyCar would not return to the track for the 2011 season. The speedway also announced changes to the NASCAR schedule for 2011, with the NASCAR Cup Series race moving to September 16–18 as the first race in the 2011 Chase for the Championship. The Nationwide Series and Camping World Truck Series also raced the same weekend, in addition, the Nationwide Series had a stand-alone race day on June 4.\n\nOn May 14, 2015, Andersen Promotions, which organizes the Indy Lights series, conducted an oval test at Chicagoland Speedway, marking the first time since 2010 any level of the Mazda Road to Indy was at the track. The test was used by INDYCAR officials to give the Dallara IL-15 its first official oval laps.\n\nThe track length is disputed by the two major series that run at Chicagoland Speedway.

{"id": "342780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=342780", "title": "Citizens Bank Park", "text": "Citizens Bank Park\n\nCitizens Bank Park is a baseball park located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania within the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. It is the home of the Philadelphia Phillies, the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. It opened April 3, 2004, and hosted its first regular-season baseball game on April 12 of the same year, with the Phillies losing to the Cincinnati Reds, 4–1.\n\nThe ballpark was built to replace the now-demolished Veterans Stadium (a football/baseball multipurpose facility), and features a natural grass and dirt playing field as well as a number of Philadelphia-style food stands, including several which serve cheesesteaks, hoagies and other regional specialties. The ballpark lies on the northeast corner of the Sports Complex, which includes Lincoln Financial Field, Wells Fargo Center, and Xfinity Live!. The stadium's capacity is 43,305 seats.\n\nIn 1999, the Phillies and the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League joined their Western Pennsylvania counterparts, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers, in making requests to replace both Veterans Stadium and Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh with separate stadiums. Pressure for new Philadelphia stadiums increased after a railing collapsed at The Vet during the 1998 Army–Navy Game, injuring eight cadets. The Pirates threatened to leave Pittsburgh in 1997, which helped convince the legislature to approve funding for the four proposed stadiums. While Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh approved the pacts swiftly, due to plans already being in place at the time of legislative approval, debate within Philadelphia's city leadership carried on as Pittsburgh opened their stadiums (PNC Park for the Pirates and Heinz Field for the Steelers) in 2001. The Eagles agreed to a site slightly southeast of Veterans Stadium, which would become Lincoln Financial Field. The Eagles' stadium was built on the site of an old food warehouse and celebrated its grand opening in August 2003.\n\nThe Phillies originally wanted a downtown ballpark similar to Baltimore, Denver, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit and San Francisco. Various locations were proposed, initially at Broad and Spring Garden streets, Spring Garden and Delaware Avenue and next to 30th Street Station, where the main post office was located. The team and the city announced that the site would be at 13th and Vine streets in Chinatown, just north of Interstate 676, within walking distance of Center City. There was considerable support for a downtown ball park from business and labor and the city at large. However, Chinatown residents protested, fearing a new ballpark would destroy their neighborhood. The City and team eventually settled on building at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, on the site of an old food warehouse much like Lincoln Financial Field. In the years that followed, residents, fans and owner Bill Giles expressed regret that the new ball park was not located in Center City. Regardless of location, the team set records in 2010 for attendance (3,647,249 fans, averaging 45,028) and sellouts (81), extending a streak dating back to July of 2009 to 123 straight sellouts.\n\nThe new stadium was designed by EwingCole's Stanley Cole, who was the stadium's chief architect. The unveiling of the park and ground breaking ceremonies were on June 28, 2001. Following the game that evening, the location of the left-field foul pole was unveiled at the outset of the team's annual 4 July fireworks display. On June 17, 2003, Citizens Bank agreed with the team to a 25-year, US $95 million deal for naming rights and advertising on telecasts, radio broadcasts, publications and inside the facility. The ballpark was officially topped off on August 12, 2003, and opened in April 2004.\n\nShortly after the park opened in 2004, the bullpens were reassigned so the Phillies' pitchers used the lower pen and visitors use the upper pen. This was done to give Phillies' pitchers a better view of the game and to protect them from heckling by rowdy fans. However, the team forgot to rewire the bullpen phones after the bullpens were reassigned; so during the first game, the dugout coaches had to communicate with the bullpens by hand signals.\n\nIn its first years, Citizens Bank Park allowed 218 home runs in 2004 and 201 in 2005. More than half of those home runs were to left-field. Following the 2005 season, the left-field wall was moved back .\n\nEven with these modifications, the park has a reputation as one of the most hitter-friendly parks in baseball. In 2009, it gave up 149 home runs, the most in the National League and second in the majors behind only the new Yankee Stadium, but has been neutral since, with a .997 park factor in 2011.\n\n\n\n\nBehind center field is Ashburn Alley, named after Phillies Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who played for the team from 1948 to 1959 and was a Phillies broadcaster from 1963 until his death in 1997. It is seen by Phillies fans as a compromise between the Phillies and their fans, many of whom wanted Citizens Bank Park named in honor of Ashburn.\n\nAshburn Alley is named for the slightly-overgrown grass which bordered the third base line at Shibe Park where Ashburn was famous for laying down bunts that stayed fair. The new Ashburn Alley, located near Ashburn's defensive position, is a walkway featuring restaurants, games and memorabilia from Phillies history. Ashburn Alley also features a memorabilia shop and a large bronze statue of Ashburn directly behind center field, as well as the U.S. flag, the flags of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia, a POW/MIA flag and the flags from the Phillies' championships (below).\n\nFeatures of the Alley are:\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, organist Paul Richardson performed from Ashburn Alley, as Citizens Bank Park was built without an organ booth.\n\n\nBesides the Richie Ashburn statue in Ashburn Alley, statues of three other famous Phillies — Robin Roberts (at the First Base Gate), Mike Schmidt (at the Third Base Gate) and Steve Carlton (at the Left Field Gate) — ring the outside of the facility. Each of the statues were made by local sculptor Zenos Frudakis. Other art found throughout the park includes tile mosaics, murals and terrazzo floors with outlined images of famous players in Phillies history.\n\nIn April 2011, the Phillies accepted a gift of a fan-underwritten bronze statue of legendary broadcaster Harry Kalas. Created by noted local sculptor Lawrence Nowlan, it was placed behind Section 141, near the restaurant that bears Kalas' name, after a dedication held on August 16, 2011 prior to that night's game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The statue was unveiled two days later than originally scheduled (the originally-scheduled date is on a plaque on the ground below the statue) because of a rained-out game between the Phillies and the Washington Nationals.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies are the first Major League Baseball team to join the Environmental Protection Agency's Green Power Partnership Program which motivates organizations across the world to purchase green power in order to minimize environmental impact. The Phillies announced on April 30, 2008 that their home field, Citizens Bank Park, will be powered with 20 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green energy purchased in Green-e Energy Certified Renewable Certificates (RECs). The EPA stated that this purchase holds the record in professional sports for the largest purchase of 100% renewable energy.\nThe Phillies are among the top three purchasers of green power in Philadelphia, and the executive director of the Center for Resource Solutions, Arthur O'Donnell, wants \"other clubs to take their lead.\" Aramark Corporation is the Phillies' food and beverage provider at Citizens Bank Park and they are taking major actions in improving the environmental impact of the Phillies' stadium. Glass, cardboard and plastics used during game day are recycled; frying oil is being recycled to produce biodiesel fuel, and biodegradable, recyclable, and compostable products, serviceware, and plastics have been introduced.\n\nOn January 2, 2012, Citizens Bank Park hosted the fifth annual NHL Winter Classic between the long time division rivals New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers before an SRO crowd of 46,967. The game, which was televised throughout the United States and Canada by NBC and CBC respectively, was won by the Rangers, 3–2. Two days earlier on New Year's Eve, 45,667 had attended an alumni game played between teams made up of former who had retired from the NHL between the 1970s and 2011 of which eight (four on each team) were also members of the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Flyers' starting goalie for the game, which was won by the Flyers alumni, 3-1, was Hall of Famer Bernie Parent. He had made his first since his playing career ended prematurely due to an eye injury suffered during a game against the Rangers played at the neighboring (although since demolished) Spectrum in February 1979.\n\nFour days after the 2012 NHL Winter Classic game, a third sell out crowd of 45,663 filled the Park on January 6 to watch the Flyers' AHL farm team, the Adirondack Phantoms, defeat the Hershey Bears, 4-3, in overtime. That crowd exceeded by a factor of more than two the previous largest gathering (21,673) to ever attend an AHL game since the league was established in 1936. With the normal 43,651 baseball seating capacity of the Park having been increased by more than 3,000 with the installation of built over the bullpen area in center field, the trio of outdoor hockey games drew a combined total of 138,296 over the week of Winter Classic events.\n\nThe first concert at the park was Jimmy Buffett & The Coral Reefer Band on August 25, 2005; they returned on June 14, 2008.\n\nThe Eagles, The Dixie Chicks and Keith Urban were scheduled to perform on June 14, 2010, but the show was cancelled.\n\nOther performers who have played at the park include Billy Joel and Elton John in a duet concert, Bon Jovi and The Police.\n\nDue to the City of Philadelphia's smoking ban, smoking is no longer allowed anywhere within the stadium as of the 2018 season.\n\nDan Baker, public address announcer for the Phillies since 1972, continues to introduce the players. During each player's first at-bat, Baker, in an excited voice, says, \"Now batting for the Phillies, number (#), (position), (player's name)\".\n\nFor example, a first at-bat introduction would have Baker say, \"Now batting for the Phillies, number 11, shortstop Jimmy Rollins!\" During subsequent at-bats, players are only announced by their position and name, for example, \"Phillies first baseman, Ryan Howard!\"\n\nBaker only uses the city of the opposing team when he announces their players rather than the team nickname, for example, \"Now batting for Atlanta, number ten, third baseman Chipper Jones\", and makes the announcement in a more-subdued tone.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, Citizens Bank Park installed Daktronics video and message displays in the park. One of the largest incandescent displays in Major League Baseball was installed in left field that was used as a scoreboard and for giving statistics. There are also out-of-town field-level displays installed in the park that measure approximately 10 feet high by 25 feet wide. During the 2010–2011 offseason, the Phillies replaced their incandescent scoreboard with a new HD scoreboard that cost $10 million. The new screen measures high and wide, which nearly triples the size of the old screen, and is the second largest HD screen in the National League, after the San Diego Padres' PETCO Park screen (61 ft. high and 124 ft. wide).\n\nThe food at CBP was named as Best Ballpark Food in a survey of Food Network viewers in the first annual Food Network Awards which first aired on April 22, 2007. On August 14, 2007, it was announced that Citizens Bank Park was voted #1 by PETA as America's most vegetarian-friendly ballpark, which was repeated in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012.\n\n\n"}

In the Fall of 2004, the first World Champions Beach Ultimate (sport) was held in Figuiera de Foz, Portugal. In order to play in the tournament, players needed to be on the official roster of a country's team. The United States roster was already filled. In order to play in the tournament, Cestero and Le (who played ultimate together at Dartmouth College) along with other Dartmouth class of '01 alums (Michael Holmes, Christopher Taylor, Craig Davis, and Michael Gallagher), decided to create a fictional island nation to represent.\n\nLe wrote a letter to the head of the WCBU as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs for Currier Island, stating that the tournament would not be a true world championship if Currier Island was not invited to compete. Together, Cestero and Le convinced the tournament directors to allow Currier Island into the tournament.\n\nShortly thereafter, the tournament directors replied to Le and Cestero inquiring as to the geographic location of Currier Island, as they were unable to find it online or on any maps. Le and Cestero admitted that the island was fictitious, but the tournament committee decided to allow Currier Island to compete as an international pick-up team. It was decided that at every WCBU tournament from then on, an international team would be allowed to play under the flag of Currier Island. \n\nThe inaugural Currier Island team consisted of players from the U.S., Hungary, Austria, and South Africa. After a week-long training camp in Tarifa, Currier Island beat countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, and Finland to finish 10th in the first annual World Beach Championships. \n\nThe Currier Island team has continued to play in beach ultimate tournaments around the world, including Paganello in Italy, Boracay Open in the Philippines, and Wildwood in New Jersey.\n\n"}

{"id": "41576749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41576749", "title": "Evans Scholars Foundation", "text": "Evans Scholars Foundation\n\nThe Evans Scholars Foundation is a nonprofit organization based in Golf, Illinois that provides full tuition and housing college scholarships to golf caddies. Operated by the Western Golf Association, the Evans Scholars Foundation has helped more than 10,600 caddies graduate from college since its creation in 1930.\n\nThe Evans Scholars Foundation was founded in 1930 with money earned and donated by famed amateur golfer Charles Chick Evans.\n\nIn 1916, Evans rose to fame by becoming the first amateur golfer to win the Western Amateur, Western Open, U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open. As a result of those wins and other victories, Evans was given several thousand dollars in royalties for recording golf instructions for the Brunswick Record Company. In addition, he received royalties from a golf book written in 1921. If he accepted this money, he would have lost his amateur status. Evans' mother suggested he put the money to good use by sponsoring a scholarship fund for caddies. Evans himself was unable to finish his schooling at Northwestern University. Evans said his mother \"wouldn't think of accepting my money unless we could arrange it to be trusted to furnish educations for deserving, qualified caddies.\" He also said his mother \"pointed out that the money came from golf and thus should go back into golf. It was all her dream — her idea.\"\nEvans went to the Western Golf Association, an organization that conducted national golf championships, to get their support for his scholarship. The WGA initially declined Evans' request, stating that it was a golf organization interested only in running championships, most notably the Western Open. In 1929, Evans successfully lobbied the WGA to manage the scholarship on his behalf with the help of his longtime friend and prominent Chicago tax attorney Carleton Blunt.\nIn 1930, Evans' dream became a reality when two caddies, Harold Fink and Jim McGinnis, were named the first two recipients of the Evans Scholarship and enrolled at Northwestern, the same university where Evans himself had once been a student.\nUntil World War II, all Evans Scholars attended Northwestern, and, in 1940, the first Evans Scholarship House was established on the Evanston campus.\n\nAfter Evans' initial investment in the Foundation had run out, Blunt, an avid golfer and philanthropist, agreed to continue to help raise money to send more caddies to college. The organization didn't seek outside funding until 1949, relying solely on the generosity of the Western Golf Association's Directors.\n\nTo help grow the program as Blunt raised additional funds for scholarship, the Western Golf Association hired Roland F. “Mac” McGuigan, Dean of Men at Northwestern and Faculty Advisor to the Northwestern Chapter of Evans Scholars, in 1949 to serve as its Educational Director.\n\nFollowing World War II, the program grew dramatically. In 1950, the foundation sent just 84 caddies to college. By the end of the decade, the number of Scholars enrolled in college increased to 440 and a number of other Scholarship Houses had been established across the country.\n\nAs the number of scholarships grew so did the organization's presence on a number of college campus, mainly those in the Midwest. In total, 15 Scholarship Houses have been founded. In order of their founding, Evans Scholarship Houses can be found at: Northwestern, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Michigan State University, Marquette University, University of Minnesota, Ohio State University, Purdue University, University of Colorado Boulder, University of Missouri, Indiana University Bloomington, Miami University, Northern Illinois University, and University of Oregon.\n\nIn 2013, The Evans Scholars Foundation sent Scholars to the University of Notre Dame. Their enrollment marked the first time the program has sent its caddies to the private university in South Bend, Indiana in nearly 50 years.\n\nThere are now 965 Scholars at 19 universities across the nation.\n\nOn October 23, 2016 the Evans Scholars Foundation celebrated the opening of a new chapter house at the University of Oregon. In 2016, the program expanded to the University of Kansas.\n\nSince its founding, the Evans Scholars Foundation has invested more than $365 million in the college educations of more than 10,600 Alumni.\n\nSeveral Evans Scholars Alumni have gone on to excel in the business world and other fields.\n\nThe list includes CEOs Sam Allen of John Deere, Thomas Falk of Kimberly-Clark and Timothy Schwertfeger, former longtime chief of Nuveen Investments. Iridium Communications CEO Matt Desch and oil and gas magnate George Solich are also Evans Scholars Alumni. John Shubeck NBC Newscaster Anchor in Los Angeles won a scholarship while at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"Golfweek\" senior writer Jeff Rude and ESPN golf writer Bob Harig have written about their experiences as Evans Scholars.\n\nTo qualify for an Evans Scholarship, a caddie must meet four key requirements. Candidates, who are nominated by their golf clubs, must have at least two years of outstanding caddying service. Candidates must have an excellent high school academic record, including high standardized test scores. Candidates must demonstrate significant financial need. Candidates must also receive letters of recommendation from club and high school officials attesting to the applicant's character. Candidates are personally interviewed at one of a series of Selection Meetings, co-hosted by the Western Golf Association and its affiliated country clubs.\n\nFunding for the scholarships provided by the Evans Scholars Foundation comes from a variety of sources, including private donations, fundraising events and professional and amateur golf tournaments held across the country each year.\n\nSince its founding in 1950, the Western Golf Association's Par Club has been one of the most important and substantial revenue streams for the Evans Scholars Foundation. There are more than 30,600 Par Club members, many of whom belong to the more than 460 WGA member clubs across the country. In 2011, the Foundation launched its first Match Play Challenge campaign, in which a group of donors pooled together gifts of $50,000 and greater to match every gift of $2,500 and greater the Foundation received. This initiative — now in its seventh year — has raised more than $55 million for caddie scholarships, allowing the Foundation to send a record number of caddies to college. \n\nOne of the Foundation's most notable fundraising events in recent years has been the Western Golf Association's Green Coat Gala, held annually in Chicago. Golf legends Curtis Strange, Tom Watson, Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Gary Player and Johnny Miller have all been honored at the gala, which in 2016 raised $900,000 with Miller as its featured speaker.\n\nThe Foundation is the benefiting charity of the BMW Championship (PGA Tour) and has received more than $24.4 million from the tournament since BMW became its title sponsor in 2007. In addition to those proceeds, BMW has also agreed to give the program $100,000 if a player gets a hole-in-one during championship play as Steve Stricker did in 2012 at Crooked Stick Golf Club, Hunter Mahan did during the 2013 BMW Championship at Conway Farms Golf Club, Jordan Spieth did in 2015 during the BMW Championship at Conway Farms and Jason Day did it at the 2017 BMW Championship at Conway Farms. \n\nIn 2013, the Western Amateur was hosted by The Alotian Club in Little Rock, Arkansas, which donated $150,000 to the nonprofit. The Western Amateur has since been hosted by four Illinois clubs: The Beverly Country Club (2014), Rich Harvest Farms (2015), Knollwood Club (2016) Skokie Country Club (2017), and Sunset Ridge Country Club (2018).\n\nSmaller, regional golf events like the Evans Cup of Colorado, Evans Cup of Oregon and Evans Cup of Washington also raise money for caddie scholarships.\n\nCharity Navigator, a nonprofit organization that evaluates other charitable organizations across America based on criteria ranging from fiscal responsibility to accountability and transparency, has consistently given the Evans Scholars Foundation a four-star rating, the highest-possible rating.\nIn 2013, the National Scholarship Providers Association, a group whose members include the Ford Foundation, the Magic Johnson Foundation and other notable nonprofits, named the Evans Scholars Foundation as its Scholarship Provider of the Year.\n\n"}

The ballpark sat with home plate in roughly the north-northwest corner of the property. The former boundaries of the park were Interstate 630 (south, right field); Jonesboro Drive (west, right field corner); South Monroe Street (west, first base stands); buildings on driveway extended from Ray Winder Drive (north, third base stands); buildings bordering South Palm Street (east, right field). The field was in operation for around 74 years.\n\nThe ballpark was constructed during 1931, as a new home field for the Little Rock Travelers, later to become the Arkansas Travelers, minor league baseball team. The Travelers vacated Kavanaugh Field, near Little Rock Central High School, and opened their 1932 season on April 13 at the newly completed ballpark, which was initially called Travelers Field for the team name.\n\nOn August 26, 1966, Traveler Field was renamed Ray Winder Field, after Raymond Winder, who was involved with the business end of The Travelers for some sixty years. Winder started as a ticket seller in 1915, was named as the Arkansas Traveler business manager in 1931, and became part owner in 1944. The Traveler franchise was moved to Shreveport following the 1958 season, leaving Little Rock without a baseball club for the first time since 1914. Traveler Field sat empty during the 1959 season while efforts continued to return minor league baseball to Little Rock. After a public stock drive raised funds to purchase a bankrupt New Orleans franchise, the Travelers were resurrected in Little Rock for the 1960 season. Ray Winder was again asked to manage the day to day details of rebuilding the club.\n\nIn 1976, Bill Valentine, a former American League umpire, was chosen as general manager for the Travelers. Valentine was general manager until 2007, 31 years. He remained executive vice president for two more seasons, before retiring in March 2009.\n\nFaced with an aging ballpark and limited funds, Valentine began to promote the historic nature of Ray Winder Field. Through his efforts the ballpark gained recognition as one of the oldest active parks in minor league baseball, and he encouraged fans traveled to Little Rock to experience the nostalgia and sample the baseball history represented by Ray Winder Field. He promoted the home of the Arkansas Travelers as \"A great place to see old-time baseball, wholesome entertainment aimed squarely at the family market.\"\n\nIn 2005, construction began on a new ballpark in North Little Rock which would eventually become the home of the Arkansas Travelers. On September 3, 2006, the final game of the 2006 season, a capacity crowd filled Ray Winder Field as fans returned for the last Traveler game at Ray Winder Field. During this game, the Travelers beat the Springfield Cardinals by a score of 7 to 3. Beginning with the 2007 season, the Arkansas Travelers home ballpark is Dickey-Stephens Park in North Little Rock.\n\nRay Winder Field sat vacant for almost five years while forces outside of organized baseball determined the future of this historic ballpark. Many recognized the ballpark as a historic structure both for the City of Little Rock and for baseball, and it was proposed that the park be restored as a functional baseball field for city and college teams as had been done with Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama . Others proposed demolishing the historic ballpark in order to utilize the area as a parking lot for the nearby University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The Arkansas Zoological Foundation wanted the Little Rock Zoo to expand into Ray Winder by refitting the grandstand as a viewing area for an Asian elephant exhibit. During all of these discussions, the underlying atmosphere from the City of Little Rock was one of disinterest and apathy, with no apparent recognition of the park's historic ties to baseball's golden era, and no interest in assisting in the landmark ballpark's preservation.\n\nUltimately, the decision was made to sell the park to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, with all structures to be razed and the land cleared for use as a parking lot. The City of Little Rock again confirmed that they had no interest preserving the park. Several sales were held to disperse remaining artifacts to baseball fans from across the country who had visited this ballpark, and on May 14, 2011, the park was opened for a final time when the remaining wooden seats, dating to 1932, were dismantled and given to fans on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nOn July 12, 2012 the score board and the light poles were left standing while the rest of the park and all other structure were torn down and removed, and the ground paved over. It had also been hotly debated to allow the Little Rock Zoo to use the site for expansion and improvements for the betterment of the animals and visitors.\n\nAs of March 9, 2018 the score board and light poles still remain.\n\n"}

The aim of the race is to test the competitor's leadership and navigation and seamanship in a physically demanding combined challenge. The Solent Amphibious Challenge is believed to be the first sea-land style adventure race of its kind, and the race is only open to teams from the British Armed Forces. The teams consist of five personnel; a yachtmaster qualified team leader who must know well the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and Local Notices to Mariners, two crew members (one competent crew-qualified), a runner and a support cyclist.\n\nThe one-day multi-event race over land and sea is held in June of every year under the authority of Commodore HMS Collingwood and involves a maximum of 6 five-person teams. Created by Commander Duncan Forer of the Royal Navy, an active adventurer and sailor, the first race was run on 27 June 2012. It is the only adventure race worldwide that has been granted an official partnership by the British Armed Forces.\n\nThe race starts with all yachts crossing the start line at Gillkicker Point with all members on board at 9 a.m. (BST). Boats then sail west to Yarmouth Marina where the designated runner and support cyclist will land and begin a run along a prescribed route of approximately 25 miles from west to east to Bembridge Harbour at the other end of the island. The runner is entirely supported by a cyclist and the runner must not swap with the cyclist. The remaining sailing team then sail as quickly as possible to Bembridge, where they will rendezvous with the running team who will both then re-board the yacht. If the runner fails to reach Bembridge by 7 p.m. then the whole team are retired from the race (due to the tidal window). The boat and whole team then sail to meet the finish line at Gillkicker, which is the same as the earlier start line.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8689602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8689602", "title": "Wimbledon Stadium", "text": "Wimbledon Stadium\n\nWimbledon Stadium, also known as Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium, was a greyhound racing track located in Wimbledon in southwest London, England.\n\nIt also hosted stock car and other small circuit motor racing events and until 2005 hosted motorcycle speedway. The stadium hosted the English Greyhound Derby every year between 1985 and 2016.\n\nThe stadium closed in March 2017 with owners Galliard Homes Limited set to build more than 600 flats on the site; there will also be an 11,000 seater football stadium built on the site which will be the new home of AFC Wimbledon, with capacity to increase it to a 20,000 seater stadium at a later date. The club is planning to play at the new stadium from the start of the 2019–20 season.\n\nThe facilities included a brick fronted grandstand seating 8,000, executive suites, several bars and catering facilities, including a large waiter-service restaurant. The stadium was surrounded by a large open-air car park.\n\nThe greyhound stadium was constructed east of the River Wandle on a section of land that was difficult to build on due to the fact that it was marsh land and was prone to flooding. The only buildings near this plot of land were a chamois leather mills, a large sewage works and the Plough public house. Slightly to the east was Summerstown Road which held the only housing in the immediate area.\n\nThe difficult plot did not deter South London Greyhound Racecourses Ltd who went ahead with plans to build a large stadium ready for 1928. However financial difficulties halted the project until a consortium headed by Bill 'WJ' Cearns whose firm had been responsible for the construction of the stadium stepped in with a sufficient funds to save the project.\n\nThe opening night was on 19 May 1928 with the first race being won by a greyhound called Ballindura trained by Harry Leader. The Burhill kennels in Walton-on-Thames became renowned within the industry housing the hounds for Wimbledon and were initially used by trainers Stanley Biss, Harry Leader and Ken Appleton. Paddy McEllistrim, a Norfolk farmer and breeder of greyhounds, and Sidney Orton joined the training kennels soon after.\n\nWimbledon was the first track to introduce weighing scales in 1929 at their kennels so that the racing public could be issued with the greyhounds weights before racing. The same year Harry Leader returned to Ireland and was replaced by Sidney Orton. New events called the Puppy Derby, International, Wimbledon Gold Cup and Wimbledon Spring Stakes were all inaugurated.\n\nIn December 1929 Arundel Kempton purchased Mick the Miller for £2,000 as a present for his wife placing him with Sidney Orton. The track had already been associated with Mick the Miller because the champion took up residence at the kennels of Paddy McEllistrim during the duration of the 1929 English Greyhound Derby. Con Stevens was the first Racing Manager and was instrumental in bringing the first classic race to Wimbledon in the form of the Laurels in 1930. Mick the Miller claimed his second Derby crown in 1930 propelling himself, the sport and Wimbledon into national fame.\n\nTrainer Joe Harmon arrived from White City in 1934 and Paddy Fortune another new trainer at Wimbledon claimed a second Derby victory for the track in 1939 after the greyhound Highland Rum won the race. The 'Two Year Old Produce Stakes' was introduced in 1935 and another event called 'The Key' started in 1936.\n\nDuring World War II the stadium suffered bomb damage but continued to race. The well known Irish dog Tanist was put with Paddy McEllistrim but found it hard to cope with the sharp turns at Wimbledon and failed to win a single race by the end of June 1940. In contrast Ballynennan Moon became a Wimbledon greyhound after Billy Quinn negotiated a sale to Mrs Cearns, wife of the managing director of Wimbledon Stadium and the greyhound became a household name during the war years. In 1942 after a winter rest he won the Walthamstow Stakes and Wimbledon Spring Cup before embarking on forty wins and seven second places from 48 starts. After finishing first fourteen times in succession he was beaten a neck by Laughing Lackey failing to beat Mick the Miller's 19 straight wins record.\n\nA new puppy called Ballyhennessy Seal first came to the scene in 1943 after moving from Catford Stadium to Wimbledon and was placed in the care of Stan Martin. Martin had joined the Wimbledon training ranks following the death of Joe Harmon in 1942. Martin guided Ballyhennessy Seal to a third Derby success for the track in 1945.\n\nAfter the war the Wimbledon management constructed a new grandstand in place of the war damaged section of the stadium. They also introduced new perforated tote tickets following continual losses on forged tote tickets every Saturday to the tune of £1,000. Ballymac Ball was the next greyhound to win the Derby for Wimbledon, the brindle dog won the 1950 event for Stan Martin. In 1950 the Instaprint photo timer that was tested at Wimbledon and given the seal of approval to use throughout Britain.\n\nCon Stevens continued to manage the stadium throughout the 1950s overseeing the success of the track and a fifth Derby success came in 1957 after the Dennis Hannafin (brother of Jerry) trained Ford Spartan took the title. In 1958 Paddy Fortune died and his kennels were taken over by George Waterman. Within a few months Sidney Orton retired and his son Clare Orton took up his position at Wimbledon. Clare had been a trainer in his own right for nearly ten years.\n\nPhil Rees Sr. joined the track as a trainer in the 1960s following the retirement of Dennis Hannafin and the Greyhound Express Merit Puppy Championship was renamed the Juvenile in 1963. George Waterman died and his Burhill kennel range was given to new trainer Nora Gleeson. The three times Derby winning trainer Paddy McEvoy also joined the track in the late 1960s. Towards the end of 1969 the possibility of the stadium being redeveloped was a possibility but the Greyhound Racing Association bought a major part of Wimbledon after a prolonged battle against developers.\n\nThe redevelopment issue could still not be discounted because the GRA Property Trust was buying and selling stadiums but the GRA invested into the stadium and raised the winning prize money levels of the Laurels to £2,000 in 1970 and £5,000 one year later. In 1972 the GRA sealed a deal to buy Wimbledon outright and bring the track fully under the GRA banner. Paddy McEllistrim and Stan Martin both retired in 1974 and were replaced by Paddy's daughter Norah and Sam Sykes, a former head lad to Clare Orton. Con Stevens resigned from the board of directors at Wimbledon bringing to an end his 46 years of association with the track.\n\nWimbledon introduced new technology in 1976 after using a sectional timing mechanism and they were one of the first tracks to use the system of grading (selecting greyhounds in classes on ability). In the same year Mutts Silver won the Derby when trained by Phil Rees Snr; Rees handed his kennels to his son Philip Rees Jnr just two years later, after retiring.\n\nIn 1985 Wimbledon was chosen to host the sport's premier event, the Greyhound Derby, following the closure of White City. Industry support for Wembley to be given the premier race was inconsequential because GRA owned the rights to the competition and would not allow a non-GRA track to have the race. Bob Rowe the Chief Racing Manager for the GRA was also the Racing Manager at Wimbledon when the track was handed the Derby and trainers Tom Foster and David Kinchett both joined from White City. The first Derby at Wimbledon was held over a new distance of and ended with a seventh success for the track, Pagan Swallow won the competition and the Rees family became the second father and son to each win the Derby. Arthur Hitch joined the tack in 1987 when Slough Stadium closed and then following the closure of Harringay the prestigious Oaks for bitches was switched to Wimbledon.\n\nIn 1990 a greyhound called Druids Johno was given to Prince Edward, the half share of the black dog had been given to the Prince by Patsy Byrne during a charity meeting at Kingsmead Stadium, Canterbury. Byrne joined Wimbledon as a trainer in 1991 and sponsored the long running International in the process. This appointment brought about the last ever Derby triumph for the track. Ballinderry Ash took the 1991 title bringing the total to eight just one behind Wembley.\n\nIn 1992 GRA parent company Wembley plc announced losses of £8 million despite a £13 million profit in its UK operation. Simon Harris became Racing Manager arriving from Hall Green, while Bob Rowe remained based at Wimbledon in his role of Chief Racing Manager of the GRA. In 1996 the Intertrack betting service was introduced for the first time, enabling race-goers at other tracks around the country to view the racing and place bets direct into the Wimbledon tote. In 1998 the Laurels switched to sister track Belle Vue Stadium and a new Paddock Bar extension costing £500,000 opened, the kennels were moved to the first bend to facilitate the change..One year later Sky Sports screened their first greyhound meeting at Wimbledon which included the Springbok final. The GRA switched the Grand National to Wimbledon from Hall Green in 1999.\n\nRapid Ranger completed two Derby successes in 2001 emulating Mick the Miller and Patricias Hope before both Seamus Cahill and Bernie Doyle joined Wimbledon from Catford and Reading Stadium respectively in 2002. Catford closed in 2003 resulting in three new trainers, John Simpson, Tony Taylor and John Walsh. Catford Racing Manager Derek Hope took over from the departing Simon Harris who left for Coventry. In 2003 Wimbledon underwent £70,000 track improvements following criticism received during the 2002 Derby, consequently the trip changed to and the changed to . In 2004 trainer Tommy Foster retired.\n\nWestmead Hawk won the 2005 & 2006 Greyhound Derby becoming the fourth greyhound to complete two wins and in 2007 trainer Ray Peacock died. Racing Manager Derek Hope left to join William Hill and was replaced by Gary Matthews and in 2008 Richard Rees, son of Philip Rees Jnr, became a third generation trainer at Wimbledon; Philip Rees Jnr retired due to ill health. Tony Morris who stood as a track bookmaker also retired after a long career at Wimbledon. In 2010 Wimbledon underwent major changes in time for the Derby, the grandstand was switched to the far side of the stadium and the physical makeup of the track altered meaning new track records would be set. The changes cost around £400,000 which were partly funded by a £195,370 grant from the British Greyhound Racing Fund.\n\nThe GRA allowed the Grand National to go to Central Park Stadium in Sittingbourne in 2012 and leading trainer Norah McEllistrim left for Brighton & Hove Greyhound Stadium. Bob Rowe switched to Belle Vue as the Racing Manager along with the Oaks.\n\n\nUntil 2005, the stadium was also home for over 50 years to the now defunct Wimbledon Dons speedway team and was famous for hosting the Internationale meeting every season. from 1962 until 1981. though they did hold a qualifying round of this competition in 1961. Speedway arrived at Wimbledon in the 1928 pioneer season and a team was entered in the league competitions from 1929 to 1939. The team was re-formed after the war and the Dons raced in the top flight National League Division One from 1946 to 1964. The Dons were multiple winners of the league in the 1950s. The Dons were founder members of the British League in 1965. Upon their reopening after the war, in 1946, average weekly attendances were in excess of 30,000, until the early 1950s, when the sport declined rapidly in popularity. Still Wimbledon were one of the top teams with healthy crowd figures, and upon the closure of Wembley in 1956 remained the only team in London (apart from sporadic appearances by New Cross in 1959/1960 and 1963) until 1963 when Hackney entered the Provincial League, and 1964 when West Ham reopened in the National League (now known as the 1st Division Elite League).\n\nWimbledon's tenure in the top flight came to an end in the 1980s and the Greyhound Racing Association (the owners of the stadium at the time) decreed that speedway would end at the end of the 1986 season. However, a London stockbroker, David Pickles, gathered together a consortium in the 1986/87 close season who ensured that the famous Dons would continue to run. They employed the ex-England team manager John Berry and enjoyed reasonable success on and off the track in their first season. After a disagreement with Berry and the other members of the board, Pickles dramatically resigned as chairman of the club during the match with Exeter in September 1987, selling his shares back to the other members. With a few reshuffles at board level and the leaving of Berry, the remaining members eventually took Wimbledon back to the British League Division One in 1991, but the move proved disastrous and with only a couple of months of the season having been ridden, the financial losses proved to be so great that they were forced to disband the team. In June 1991 Wimbledon rode their final meeting, which was eventually curtailed due to the weather. Although there was no longer any league racing at the Plough Lane stadium the team continued their league fixtures for the 1991 season moving to Eastbourne and were known as the Eastbourne Dons.\n\nHaving been defunct for eleven years, the team were then reopened again in 2002 but were finally disbanded completely in 2005 as a result of the dispute between the team's promoters and the owners of the stadium, the Greyhound Racing Association, over a proposed large rent increase.\n\nPlough Lane also hosted Motor Racing events promoted by Spedeworth International, including Superstox, Stock Cars, Hot Rods and Bangers. The first stock car meeting at Wimbledon was on 29 September 1962 (the Superstox World Championship) and the circuit quickly became Spedeworth's flagship venue with the World Final being held there every year up to and including 1974. The World Championship, along with other key race meetings such as Carnival Night, became very popular and were often 'ticket only' events filled to capacity. The stadium also boasted its own stock car racing teams in 1966 (London Sparrows) and 1971–72 (Canaries/Dons). The 1966 team shared its base with New Cross Stadium. The Unlimited Banger World Final also used to take place at Wimbledon until the event moved to Foxhall Stadium in 2008. This was due to the introduction of the London low emission zone which made it too expensive for the transporters to travel to the venue.\n\nWimbledon Stadium was the scene for part of the music video for the Queen song \"Bicycle Race\", in which 65 professional female models, all nude, rode on bikes around the stadium.\n\nBanger racing at the stadium was featured in the ITV police series \"The Sweeney\". The story was entitled \"Contact Breaker\".\n\nIn 2007 the stadium was purchased by development company Galliard Homes Limited when the Greyhound Racing Association was put up for sale (along with all of its assets) by parent company Wembley PLC. Following this, the local professional football team AFC Wimbledon expressed interest in building their new football stadium on the site of the greyhound track in collaboration with Galliard Homes. A joint planning application made by Galliard Homes and AFC Wimbledon to build the new football stadium, together with 600 residences, on the site of the greyhound stadium was approved by the London Borough of Merton in December 2015. Attempts to prevent the closure of the stadium failed; a £20 million rival planning bid to build a new greyhound stadium, submitted by Irish businessman Paschal Taggart, the owner of Shelbourne Park Greyhound Stadium, and a bid by pressure group 'Save Wimbledon Stadium Action Group' to have the stadium granted listed status by Historic England both came to nothing. The stadium was finally closed on 25 March 2017, and demolition of the stadium and associated buildings commenced on the 16th March 2018. A ceremony to commence this work was attended by AFC Wimbledon CEO Erik Samuelson, Wimbledon FC legends Dave Bassett and Ian Cooke, who were joined by Leader of Merton Council Stephen Alambritis, to celebrate another significant milestone in the new club's journey towards a Plough Lane return.\n\n"}
