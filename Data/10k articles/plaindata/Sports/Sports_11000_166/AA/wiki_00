The club was founded on November 29, 1990, making it one of the youngest professional football clubs in Colombia. The club's best seasons came in the late 2000s; they finished runners-up in 2007 and again in 2009. They play their home games at the Guillermo Plazas Alcid stadium, which has a capacity of 27,000. Huila has a long-standing rivalry with Deportes Tolima, known as the \"Tolima Grande\" derby. The club has a futsal team named Ultrahuilca Coomotor.\nThe club was founded in November 1990 and was admitted into the Primera B tournament the following year. In 1992, Alberto Rujana was appointed as manager. That same season, the club purchased midfielder Guillermo Berrío from America de Cali; Rujana named him captain and made him the centerpiece of the squad. Immediate promotion followed. The club managed to last in the top flight until the end of the 1996–97 season, when they finished last in the relegation table and were sent back to Primera B.\n\nRafael Corrales took over the club in 1996–97, and led them to an immediate promotion back to the top flight. They stayed there for a decade, although relegation was a constant danger. The club escaped only on goal differential in 2002 and had to win a relegation playoff in 2006. This was why the club's performance in 2007 was almost entirely unexpected.\n\nUnder the management of Nelson Otero, the club finished third in the Apertura and qualified for the semifinal phase. They further surprised by winning their playoff group (beating Millonarios on the final day of the round robin) to reach the Apertura finals. Atlético Nacional beat them 2–1 over two hard-fought legs, but it was nonetheless something to be proud of. A similarly unexpected result came in the second half of the 2009 season, when the club finished third in the Finalización and topped their semifinal group. Once again they bowed over two legs, this time to Independiente Medellín by a 3–2 aggregate score. That strong performance in the 2009 season allowed Atlético Huila to qualify for the following year's Copa Sudamericana for the first time in history, in which they beat Venezuelan team Trujillanos in the first stage, but were knocked out by San José from Bolivia in the second stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was once part of Woolwich Common, then used as a venue for first-class cricket matches in the 18th century and as the home of Woolwich Cricket Club at that time; later it became the home of the Royal Artillery Cricket Club. It is now used as a generic sports field, mainly for football.\n\nWoolwich CC came briefly to prominence in August 1754 when the team played home and away games against Dartford, which at this time was probably the strongest team in England. In both matches, the away team won but no further details are known. Both games were mentioned in the same report by \"Read's Weekly Journal\" dated Sat 31 August: \"Dartford won away & lost at home against Woolwich on Sat. & Mon., Aug. 24 & 26 respectively\". The Woolwich club's ability to successfully challenge Dartford at this time clearly infers that it was a leading club in the 1750s but its new found prominence was short-lived, probably because of the outbreak of the Seven Years' War which severely limited first-class cricket through its span.\n\nThe club revived in the last ten years of the 18th century when, following the establishment of Marylebone Cricket Club in 1787, club cricket was very fashionable in London and matches between the town clubs were very popular. Barrack Field was frequently used for matches in this period.\n\nThe \"CricketArchive\" database records 96 matches, mostly services fixtures, as having taken place at Barrack Field but this record is incomplete because it excludes 8 matches played between 1797 and 1802, all of which are listed below:\n\n\nThe list is by no means exhaustive as ongoing research may find references to other matches at the ground.\n\nIt is possible that Woolwich CC was merged into the Royal Artillery Cricket Club (RACC) or alternatively that it disbanded after the RACC took full possession of Barrack Field. According to its own website, RACC first played cricket in 1765, having been started as a private club by Royal Artillery officers. It was formally constituted as a regimental club as late as 1906. On 15 June 1818, RACC played MCC at Barrack Field in a match that was tied. \n\n \n"}

It is a tactic involved in planning a series of captures to remove the protection of the opponent's king, or to simply gain in the exchanges.\n\nOther chess authors limit battery to \"an arrangement of two pieces \"in line with the enemy king\" on a rank, file, or diagonal so that if the middle piece moves a discovered check will be delivered.\" However, in Chessgames.com blogs and game annotations of other chess websites, the term is also used in cases where moving the middle piece will uncover a threat other than a check along the opened line.\nIt is particularly effective to form a battery using rooks because they may be combined to occupy the same rank or file. In theory, bishops may also form a battery in a case of underpromotion of a pawn to a bishop occupying the same diagonal as the other bishop. In actual games, however, the queen and rooks are often employed.\n\nBatteries are often used as part of a combination which may involve other types of chess tactics as well. In some chess openings, the queen is often involved in the set up, and becomes part of a battery but is reserved for the final capture in the series of exchange of pieces. For example, in the main line of the Closed Sicilian characterized by 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.d3 d6, where White's main options are 6.Be3 followed by Qd2 and 0-0-0; and 6.f4 followed by Nf3 and 0-0, White's intention is to form a battery with his rooks.\n\n\n"}

This method of dismissal is covered by Law 32 of the \"Laws of Cricket\".\n\nA batter is out bowled if his or her wicket is put down by a ball delivered by the bowler. It is irrelevant whether the ball has touched the bat, glove, or any part of the batsman before going on to put down the wicket, though it may not touch another player or an umpire before doing so. Such rules mean that bowled is the most obvious of dismissals: almost never requiring an appeal to the umpire; a bowled batsman will usually acknowledge the dismissal voluntarily.\n\nIf the delivered ball deflects off the bat, and bowls the batter, then the informal term is known as \"played on\", \"knocked on\" or \"dragged on\". If the wicket is put down without the batter making any sort of contact with the ball, then it is known as \"clean bowled\" with variations being 'bowled through the gate', where the ball travels between the bat and pad, or 'bowled around the legs', where the ball goes behind (to the legside of) the batsman and hits the stumps.\n\nA batter cannot be out bowled from a no-ball, wide or dead ball, though he/she can be stumped if it is a wide.\n\nA batter is out bowled even if he/she could be given out by another method of dismissal instead. For instance, if a batsman edges the ball onto the stumps (such that the bails are removed) and the ball is caught by a fielder, then batter would be given out bowled instead of caught.\n\nBowled is the second most common method of dismissal after caught. The bowler is credited with the wicket if batter is out bowled.\n"}

Born and raised in Newcastle upon Tyne, she rose to fame in late 2002 upon winning a place in Girls Aloud, a girl group created through ITV's \"\". While still in the group, she began a solo career in April 2009, and between then and 2014, she released four studio albums – \"3 Words\" (2009), \"Messy Little Raindrops\" (2010), \"A Million Lights\" (2012) and \"Only Human\" (2014). Collectively, the albums included ten singles, five of which – \"Fight for This Love, \"Promise This\", \"Call My Name\", \"Crazy Stupid Love\" and \"I Don't Care\" – reached the top position on the UK Singles Chart. Cheryl was the first British female solo artist to have five number-one singles in the UK, and she held the record for the British female solo artist with the most UK number-one singles until Jess Glynne overtook her in 2018.\n\nCheryl became a judge on the UK version of \"The X Factor\" in 2008. She mentored two of the eventual winners of the competition (Alexandra Burke in series five and Joe McElderry in series six), before resigning in 2011 and joining the panel of the American version, which she left during the auditions stage. She returned to judge series 11 and 12 of the UK version.\n\nCheryl has become a recognised and photographed style icon, being referred to as a \"fashionista\" by the press. She has been photographed for the covers of \"British Vogue\", \"Elle\" and \"Harper's Bazaar\", and fronted cosmetic company L'Oréal in 2009. Her net worth was estimated at £20 million in October 2014. Cheryl was married to England footballer Ashley Cole from July 2006 to September 2010. She married Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in July 2014, and was granted a decree nisi from him in October 2016. From 2016 to 2018, she was in a relationship with One Direction singer Liam Payne, with whom she has a son born in March 2017.\n\nCheryl Ann Tweedy was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 30 June 1983, and grew up on council estates in the suburbs of Walker and Heaton. She is the fourth of five children of Joan Callaghan, and the first of her two children with Garry Tweedy following the collapse of her marriage to the father of her three other children. Cheryl's parents were together for more than a decade but never married; they separated when she was 11 years old.\n\nAt the age of seven, Cheryl appeared in a television advert for British Gas. Interested in dancing from an early age, she began sequence dancing at the age of four, before joining The Royal Ballet's summer school at the age of nine. She occasionally appeared doing dance recitals on different television shows in the UK, such as \"Gimme 5\", in 1993.\n\nCheryl auditioned for the reality television show \"\" in 2002, which aimed to create a boy band and a girl group to compete for the Christmas number one spot on the UK Singles Chart. She sang \"Have You Ever\" in her audition, and was one of twenty contestants (ten girls and ten boys) chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Geri Halliwell. The finalists performed live on Saturday evenings, with one gender performing each week, and each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated, until the final line-ups of the five-piece groups emerged. Cheryl was in danger of elimination twice, surviving over Emma Beard and Aimee Kearsley in consecutive performing weeks. On 30 November 2002, she was the first contestant to qualify for the girl group, and was joined by Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh to form Girls Aloud, following the final public vote. The group's debut single \"Sound of the Underground\" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the 2002 Christmas number one over boy band One True Voice's \"Sacred Trust / After You're Gone\". Girls Aloud hold the record for the shortest time between being formed as a band and achieving a number one single.\n\nGirls Aloud released their debut album \"Sound of the Underground\" in May 2003, which entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) later the same year. Their singles \"I'll Stand by You\", \"Walk This Way\", and \"The Promise\" charted at number one. Two of their albums reached the top of the UK Albums Chart: their greatest hits album \"The Sound of Girls Aloud\" and 2008's \"Out of Control\", both of which entered the chart at number one, with over one million copies of the former being sold.\nThey also achieved seven certified albums and were nominated for five Brit Awards, winning the 2009 Best Single for \"The Promise\". The group's musical style was pop, but throughout their career they experimented with electropop and dance-pop. Girls Aloud's collaborations with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim, due to an innovative approach to mainstream pop music. The group amassed a fortune of £30 million by May 2010. \"Guinness World Records\" lists them as \"Most Successful Reality TV Group\" in the 2007 edition. They also hold the record for \"Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group\" in the 2008 edition, and are credited again for \"Most Successful Reality TV Group\" in the 2011 edition. The group was also named the United Kingdom's biggest selling girl group of the 21st century, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK alone. Girls Aloud took a hiatus in 2009 in the pursuit of solo projects, saying they would reunite for a new studio album in 2010, but this did not materialise.\n\nIn 2008, Cheryl replaced Sharon Osbourne as a judge for the fifth series of \"The X Factor\" alongside creator Simon Cowell, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh. She was given the girls category (made up of female solo contestants aged 16 to 25) and subsequently ended up as the winning judge when Alexandra Burke was crowned the winner of series five on 13 December. She returned for the sixth series in 2009 and was given the boys category (made up of male solo contestants aged 16 to 25). She was the winning judge for a second consecutive year when Joe McElderry won on 13 December. Cowell referred to her as \"one of the best I've ever worked with.\" Cheryl returned for the seventh series in 2010 and mentored the girls category again. This was the first series in which she was not the winning mentor, when Rebecca Ferguson finished as runner-up to Matt Cardle, who was mentored by Minogue. In 2011, Cheryl joined Cowell, L.A. Reid, and Paula Abdul on the judging panel of the American version of \"The X Factor\". After a three-week stint she departed the series. Cowell said that the reason why she left was because he offered her a place on the 2011 series of the UK version and he felt that she would have been more comfortable there. Cheryl did not return to the UK version, as Tulisa had taken her place on the UK judging panel. Nicole Scherzinger replaced her on the judging panel of the American version for the rest of season one. In December 2012, Cheryl sued the American producers of \"The X Factor\" for $2.3 million (£1.4m). She received $1.8 million (£1.1m) for the first season, and then sued for $2 million (£1.25m) for the second season, plus additional damages. In November 2013, Cheryl won for her settlement, for an undisclosed amount between her and producers Blue Orbit.\n\nCheryl's first solo performance was on American rapper will.i.am's \"Heartbreaker\" in 2008. She was picked to appear as a dancer in the video after taking streetdancing classes during the filming of ITV2 series \"The Passions of Girls Aloud\". She was later asked by will.i.am to sing additional vocals on the track. In April 2009, she started working on solo material, and her debut album, \"3 Words\", was released in the UK on 26 October. The album spent two weeks at number one, and on 6 November, BPI certified the album platinum, denoting shipments of over 300,000 units; it later tripled this feat. The first single from the album, \"Fight for This Love\", was written by Andre Merritt, Steve Kipner and Wayne Wilkins, and produced by Kipner and Wilkins. Following a performance on \"The X Factor\" live results show, \"Fight for This Love\" entered the UK and Irish charts at number one, and in 2010, it went to number one in Denmark, Norway and Hungary, and was later certified platinum in the UK. It also became the fourth best-selling single of 2009 in the UK. Cheryl's second single, \"3 Words\", which features will.i.am, went to number four in the UK and seven in Ireland. In 2010, the single was released in Australia and charted at number five, and was certified platinum. The third single, \"Parachute\", charted in the top five in both the UK and Ireland, and was certified gold in the UK.\nCheryl started recording sessions for her second album in February 2010, though in an interview on \"\", she said that some of the songs submitted for the record dated back to \"3 Words\". The album was largely produced by Wayne Wilkins and released on 29 October 2010 under the title \"Messy Little Raindrops\". It features guest vocals from August Rigo, Dizzee Rascal, Travie McCoy, and will.i.am, and debuted at number one in the UK, and at number two in Ireland. It received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with a positive review of four out of five stars from Jon O'Brien of Allmusic. On 19 August 2011, the album was certified platinum by BPI, with shipments in the UK exceeding 300,000. The album's first single, \"Promise This\", is an up-tempo dance-pop song written by Wilkins, Priscilla Hamilton and Christopher Jackson, which was released on 24 October 2010 and became her second number-one in the UK where it was certified gold. \"The Flood\" was released as the album's second single and entered the charts after its official release at number 18.\n\nCheryl was given a one-off television programme for ITV1, \"Cheryl Cole's Night In\", which aired on 19 December 2009. The programme, hosted by Holly Willoughby, featured music and interviews with Cheryl and some of her favourite performers. Alexandra Burke, Rihanna, Will Young, Snow Patrol and will.i.am made appearances. The programme attracted 5 million viewers on its first airing.\n\nFrom May to July 2010, Cheryl was the opening act for The Black Eyed Peas at the British shows (as well as some European dates) of The E.N.D. World Tour. Cheryl was interviewed during an episode of the fourth series of \"Piers Morgan's Life Stories\", in which she discussed her marriage and divorce with Ashley Cole and her life-threatening battle with malaria. The show, which aired on 23 October 2010, drew an audience of 7.2 million, the highest figure in the chat show's history.\n\nCheryl's third studio album, \"A Million Lights\", was released on 18 June 2012. It debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, selling 34,934 copies in its first week on sale, and was her first not to debut at number one in the UK and her first not to sell over 100,000 copies in its first week. Her debut album \"3 Words\" sold 125,000 copies while its follow-up \"Messy Little Raindrops\" sold around 105,000 copies. \"A Million Lights\" was certified gold in the UK for shipments of 100,000 copies. The lead single \"Call My Name\", became Cheryl's third number one single on the UK Singles Chart, with the sales of 152,001 digital copies. The song became 2012's fastest selling number one single on the UK Singles Chart until December of the same year, when the winner of that year's series of \"The X Factor\", James Arthur, sold 490,560 copies with his cover of Shontelle's \"Impossible\". \"Call My Name\" sold a total of 417,000 copies in the UK, and was the 34th best-selling single of 2012 there. \"Under the Sun\", the second single from the album, was released on 2 September 2012, and peaked at number 13, becoming her seventh consecutive solo top-twenty single. To promote \"A Million Lights\", Cheryl embarked on her first solo concert tour, A Million Lights Tour. The tour ran from 3 to 17 October 2012, and comprised 11 show dates: two in Ireland, one in Scotland and eight in England. She also did a set of meet and greets at each concert. The £350 offer included an autograph, a chance to meet her and a photograph with her backstage, with proceeds going towards her charity, The Cheryl Cole Foundation. The meet and greet ticket drew negative criticism from fans, who complained about the high price.\n\nOn 4 June 2012, Cheryl performed a duet with Gary Barlow at the Diamond Jubilee Concert, which was organised and created by Barlow as part of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II and watched by millions worldwide. In 2012, Cheryl returned to \"The X Factor\" as a guest mentor to help Barlow pick his contestants for the live shows of the competition. In November 2012, she was handed her own documentary entitled \"Cheryl: Access All Areas\", which attracted 811,000 viewers on ITV2 and 177,000 on +1.\n\nIn November 2012, after months of speculation, Girls Aloud reunited for the group's 10th anniversary. On 18 November, they released their comeback single, \"Something New\", which was also the official charity single for \"Children in Need 2012\". The single peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. The group released their second greatest hits compilation, \"Ten\", on 26 November 2012. The second single taken from \"Ten\", \"Beautiful Cause You Love Me\", was released on 17 December.

Later in the month, she performed at Capital FM's Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium. \"Crazy Stupid Love\" was officially released in July and entered the UK Singles Chart at number one, selling 118,000 copies. It became Cheryl's fourth number one single on the chart, making her the third British female artist to achieve four numbers ones as a solo artist, after Geri Halliwell and Rita Ora. The song also peaked at number one in Ireland. The second single from \"Only Human\", \"I Don't Care\", was released on 2 November and similarly to its predecessor debuted at number one in the UK, becoming Cheryl's fifth number one in the country. This made her the first British female to have five solo number one singles in the UK, and she held the record for the British female solo artist with the most UK number-one singles until Jess Glynne overtook her in 2018. \"Only Human\" was released on 10 November and became Cheryl's fourth solo album to debut within the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It was later certified silver in the UK. The album's title track was released as its third and final single in March 2015. The song, which originally peaked at number 70 as an album cut in October 2014, failed to reach the top 100 on the UK Singles Chart upon the single's release, therefore becoming Cheryl's lowest-charting single to date.\n\nIn 2014, the singer also returned as a judge on the UK version of \"The X Factor\" for its 11th series to replace Sharon Osbourne, signing a £1.5 million contract. She was joined by Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Mel B on the judging panel. She was again selected to mentor the girls category, with her final act Lauren Platt coming fourth. In 2015, Cheryl returned to \"The X Factor\" for its 12th series; she was joined by Cowell and new judges Ora and Nick Grimshaw. She was selected to mentor the groups category for the first time and her last remaining group Reggie 'n' Bollie reached the final finishing in second place. Cheryl announced her departure from \"The X Factor\" in April 2016, choosing to focus on her music career; she was replaced by Osbourne. She guest appeared in the show's 14th series in 2017 as Cowell's adviser during the Judges' houses stage.\n\nIn July 2018, Cheryl revealed that her fifth studio album was \"pretty much finished\". She worked on the record with Naughty Boy and her former bandmate Nicola Roberts with whom she co-wrote every song. The album's first single, \"Love Made Me Do It\", was released on 9 November 2018, and marked the singer's first release with new record label 3 Beat. It charted at number 19 in the UK, and number 32 in Ireland. Cheryl's performance of the song on the 15th series of \"The X Factor\" was widely criticised in the media, with viewers arguing that its \"overtly sexual nature\" was \"inappropriate\" for pre-watershed television. Following the single's release, the singer's label announced that they intend to release a series of singles before releasing a full-length album, with two singles being scheduled for the first quarter of 2019. Cheryl will serve as a dance captain on the new BBC One dance competition \"The Greatest Dancer\" alongside Matthew Morrison and Oti Mabuse. The show will air in 2019.\n\nAs a member of Girls Aloud, Cheryl teamed with Eylure to release five sets of false eyelashes, each set designed by a different member of the group. A range of festival-themed lashes followed in 2010, while limited edition \"10th Anniversary\" lash was released in 2012. Similarly, to celebrate their tenth anniversary, each member designed a charm bracelet for Pandora, available as either a complete bracelet or a \"starter\" bracelet.\n\nCheryl's first official book, entitled \"Through My Eyes\", was published on 30 September 2010 by Bantam Press. \"Through My Eyes\" purports to show her in the recording studio, backstage on tour, behind-the-scenes at \"The X Factor\", at photo shoots and at award ceremonies. She said the book is \"filled with pictures that capture those moments, [her] memories and the people [she's] closest to\". She is the subject of several unauthorised biographies, as well as books detailing her relationship with and divorce from Ashley Cole. Her autobiography, \"\", was published on 11 October 2012. The book's content was about her relationships with Simon Cowell and her ex-husband Cole. It has sold 275,000 copies , generating £2.5 million in sales. In August 2014, Cheryl released her debut fragrance, StormFlower.\n\nIn 2004, Girls Aloud released a cover of The Pretenders' \"I'll Stand by You\" as the official single for the BBC's charity telethon \"Children in Need\". In 2007, the group announced a joint release of Aerosmith and Run DMC's \"Walk This Way\" with Sugababes as the official single for the UK's other major charity telethon Comic Relief. The song was recorded at Comic Relief co-founder and trustee Richard Curtis' request.\n\nIn March 2009, Cheryl climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of Comic Relief. The climb, organised by Gary Barlow, was also undertaken by fellow Girls Aloud member Kimberley Walsh, as well as Alesha Dixon, Fearne Cotton, Denise Van Outen, Chris Moyles, Ben Shephard, Ronan Keating and Barlow himself. Between 3 February and 23 March 2009, Cheryl, Walsh, Barlow, Moyles and Cotton also raised money for Comic Relief by providing the voice for the BT Speaking Clock. All nine celebrities reached the summit of Kilimanjaro on Saturday, 7 March 2009. Cheryl, along with Cotton, Van Outen and Shephard, reached the summit first at sunrise. The trek raised £3.5 million for the charity. In February 2011, Cheryl launched her own charitable foundation with The Prince's Trust following a meeting with The Trust's President, HRH Charles, Prince of Wales. The Cheryl Cole Foundation is meant to provide vital funds for The Trust in the North East, which was set up to help disadvantaged young people from Cheryl's region. On 13 June 2011, she auctioned 20 dresses with ASOS to raise funds for the foundation.\n\nIn September 2011, Cheryl became the latest \"Forces' sweetheart\" when she visited British soldiers in Afghanistan. On 23 January 2015, Cheryl announced the launch of a second charity, once again alongside The Prince's Trust. The charity was named Cheryl's Trust, and was set up with the aim of raising £2 million to build a centre, which will support up to 4000 disadvantaged young people in her native city of Newcastle. To raise these funds, Cheryl has thus far teamed up with Prizeo in March 2015, setting up a styling session competition, and also launched a limited edition Belgian Chocolate Bar with Greggs in August 2015; 5p proceeds from each sale being donated towards the trust. In November 2016, she became the ambassador of the charity ChildLine.\n\nCheryl has a mezzo-soprano range.\nShe spoke about her vocal ability saying, \"I am very aware of my ability, I know I'm no Mariah Carey but I think the emotion in the song is what matters.\" \"3 Words\" was influenced by her appreciation for dance music and crosses from contemporary R&B, dance pop, house and a more general pop sound. \"Messy Little Raindrops\" uses a more dance pop sound than her previous album. \"A Million Lights\", her third studio album also incorporates R&B and dance. She incorporated Dubstep into \"A Million Lights\", MTV citing \"Girl in the Mirror\" as an example.\n\nCheryl has named Britney Spears and Beyoncé as a few of her inspirations, performance and fashion-wise. She spoke on the reason Beyoncé was an influence on her, saying, \"I love Beyoncé, I just think she is such a beautiful person inside and out, apart from what she does on the stage which is obviously incredible and aspiration. I just like her as a woman. She's empowering.\" She has cited Lisa \"Left Eye\"' Lopes, a former member of American band TLC, as another influence saying, \"I wanted to be [Lopes] – I used to wear baggy jeans and Timberlands like a tomboy.\" Other influences she has cited are Rihanna, whom she described as \"a perfect pop star\", and Mary J. Blige, saying, \"Mary's voice sounds so grown up and you can hear that she has experienced a lot in her life, her songs help me with every heartache.\" Cheryl has influenced other artists, including Selena Gomez. The 2006 Lily Allen song \"Cheryl Tweedy\" was written about her.\n\nIt has been widely reported that Cheryl lip-syncs during live performances. Whilst performing \"Fight for this Love\" in 2009 on \"The X Factor\", media speculated that the performance was mimed, something that she denied though she admitted to having some pre-recorded vocals to help the live performance. In 2010, during her second performance on \"The X Factor\", in which she performed \"Promise This\", she \"showcased her vocal and dancing skills with an energetic, raunchy routine that earned a standing ovation from her fellow judges.\" Similar to her 2009 performance of \"Fight for This Love\" on \"The X Factor\", the media speculated whether she lip-synced or not. An ITV spokesperson insisted that she did not mime, although the performance was pre-recorded.\n\nIn June 2012, Cheryl performed \"Call My Name\" with live vocals on \"The Voice UK\". It was reported that \"The Voice\" executives always edit the vocals for every artist on the show, and they would \"provide some finishing touches to her singing prior to it being broadcast.\" As the performance began, she swan-dived onto her backing dancers before they performed a highly elaborated routine. Following the broadcast, she received mixed comments from viewers, with a few accusing the singer of lip-synching, while others, including pop artists Emma Bunton and will.i.am, praised the performance. In an interview with BBC News, she addressed the negative comments, and said that \"if you think my live vocal sounds so good it must be mimed, I'm happy, I take it as a compliment.\"\n\nCheryl has become a recognised and photographed style icon. Fashion magazine \"British Vogue\" praised her style saying: \"Her wardrobe choices have become as successful as her singles – while filming for \"The X Factor\", she had fashion fans watching her every sartorial move and was snapped wearing a string of fashion-forward outfits from Givenchy and Preen, to McQueen and Missoni.\" In both 2009 and 2010, she was named the best dressed woman by Glamour Magazine, after 14,000 votes from the magazine's readers were counted. She has been photographed for the covers of \"British Vogue\", \"Elle\" and \"Harper's Bazaar\". In March 2010, Cheryl was declared by research company Millward Brown as the second most powerful celebrity in Britain.\n\nCheryl topped FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World in 2009 and 2010. She has won Glamour Women of the Year Awards for TV Personality and Best Dressed and Style Network Award for Best Dressed Woman and Style Icon of the Decade. In February 2009, she appeared on the cover of \"British Vogue\". The media coverage of her appearance in the magazine boosted the magazine's circulation to 240,000, its best ever February figure. She appeared on the November 2009 cover of the UK's \"Elle\" magazine. In October 2010, a wax statue of her was added to the gallery of Madame Tussauds London at a cost of approximately £150,000.\n\nCheryl began dating England and Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole in September 2004, announcing their engagement after he proposed in Dubai in June 2005. The couple were married at a ceremony at Barnet, north west London on 15 July 2006. They signed an exclusive deal with \"OK!\", reportedly worth £1 million, regarding the rights of the photographs. On 23 February 2010, Cheryl announced she was separating from Cole, and on 26 May, she filed for divorce at London's High Court citing \"unreasonable behaviour\" from her estranged husband. The divorce papers state that Cole admitted being unfaithful to Cheryl with a number of other women. She was granted a decree nisi on 3 September. She continued to use her married name, but later began using the mononym Cheryl for her music releases.\n\nOn 7 July 2014, Cheryl married French restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini after a three-month courtship. Following their separation, Cheryl began dating singer Liam Payne in early 2016, before being granted a decree nisi from Fernandez-Versini on 20 October 2016. On 22 March 2017, she gave birth to Payne's son. Cheryl and Payne announced they had ended their relationship in July 2018.\n\nIn December 2016, Cheryl appeared on the BBC One genealogy series \"Who Do You Think You Are?\", during which she researched her maternal family. Research shows that her paternal line is from Tyneside and that there were a number of coal miners amongst Cheryl's forebears. When tracing further back, in one of the branches of her paternal line, researchers find that her ancestry includes several mariners. The investigation into Cheryl's maternal line shows that her grandmother, Olga Ridley, was one of twin girls born to Edith Annie Burton, the housekeeper for a widower named Joseph Ridley who already had a number of children from his marriage. Joseph Ridley had fought in World War I in the Durham Light Infantry as a Pioneer in France and, from an examination of the census, before the war he had been a Grocery Warehouseman.\n\nOn 11 January 2003, Cheryl was involved in an altercation with a nightclub toilet attendant, Sophie Amogbokpa, and subsequently charged with racially aggravated assault over the incident. At her trial on 20 October she was found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm but cleared of the racially aggravated assault charge, and sentenced to 120 hours of community service. She was ordered to pay her victim £500 in compensation, as well as £3,000 prosecution costs. Judge Richard Howard said, \"This was an unpleasant piece of drunken violence which caused Sophie Amogbokpa pain and suffering.\"\n\n\n\nSolo tours\n\nAs solo supporting act\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17305050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17305050", "title": "EDHEC Sailing Cup", "text": "EDHEC Sailing Cup\n\nThe EDHEC Sailing Cup (« ESC ») (Course Croisière EDHEC or « CCE » in French) is the leading student sporting event in Europe and the world’s biggest intercollegiate offshore regatta. It takes place every year in a French harbor of the Atlantic Ocean. First held in 1969, it gathers nowadays 3,200 participants coming from 23 countries and from more than 165 universities. In 2017, the association received the award of best student organization of France by the ANEO challenge. \n\nToday the ESC is composed of three different trophies that include diverse sports: The Sea Trophy (a regatta), the Land Trophy (a multi-sport raid) and the Sand Trophy (a beach soccer, beach rugby and beach volley competition). \n\nThree French students from the prestigious EDHEC Business School willing to broaden the sport of sailing, Jean-Luc Picot, Francis Prat and Pierre Jouannet, decided in 1968 to organize a student regatta. It took place from May 1 to May 4, 1969 in Dunkirk. For its first edition, the thencalled EDHEC Business School Cup, gathered 18 crews and was won by a Dutch team. Older than the Vendée Globe, the Volvo Ocean Race and other sailing event, the EDHEC Sailing Cup constitutes a precursor in the high-level competitions. \n\nSeven years after its creation the regatta reached 100 crews from 10 nationalities and took its actual name, the \"EDHEC Sailing Cup\". 329 boats attended the 18th edition, a record. For the 19th edition the Organizing Team decided to build a Village to welcome participants, partners and activities in one place. The same year the \"Chaîne Avitaillement\", an open-air free supermarket, was also created. For its 23rd edition, 20 international boats participated in the regatta including the first African boat, from Tunisia, and boats from the United States and from Brazil. In 1994 was created the Land Trophy. It was first created as a replacement of the Sea Trophy. Since it was a great success, it became a full trophy. In 1998 an Israeli-Palestinian team participated in the regatta – it was the ancestor of the \"Peace Boat.\" 6,000 participants attend to the EDHEC Sailing Cup in Brest. In 1999, the EDHEC Sailing Cup became the leading student sporting event in Europe. \n\nTo give a more sporting dimension to the event, the Sand Trophy was created in 2007. For the first time in 2010 was organized the Orange Port of Call, a coastal race that gathers the participants, at night, in an area away from the Village under a marquee build up for the occasion. In 2013, the EDHEC Sailing Cup and the Intercollegiate Offshore Regatta, organized by Storm Trysail Foundation and Larchmont Yacht Club, created a partnership. It enables the winners of each regatta to have their costs of participation for the other one covered. \n\nAmong the renowned sailors who have participated at least one time in the event we can find Eric Tabarly, Alain Colas, Franck Cammas, Olivier de Kersauson, Vincent Riou, Jean Le Cam, Marc Thiercelin, Yves Parlier, Marc Pajot, Yann Eliès, Yvan Bourgnon, Jean-Luc Van Den Heede, or also Jimmy Pahun.\n\nThe Sea Trophy, created in 1969, is the historic heart of the EDHEC Sailing Cup and remains the biggest trophy of the EDHEC Sailing Cup. Each year, the competition gathers more than 230 boats. The French Federation of Sailing (FFVoile) and its National Race Committee supervise the race. It is open to all monohull boats with a Length Over All between 8 and 16 meters (approximately 25 to 50 feet) with a rating of 14 to 33.5 net handicap as well as Longtze boats. The three common boats used are Grand Surprise (around 40 boats), J/80 (around 40 boats) and Longtze (around 10 boats). The competition is divided in several rankings: An Overall Ranking, a 100% Student and the 100% International, and each competition is rewarded by different prizes. The results of the EDHEC Sailing Cup are used in order to choose which French team will be selected for the Student Yachting World Cup.\n\nThe Land Trophy was created in 1994. More than 150 teams of four or five are competing in several sports such as mountain bike, running, orienteering, canoeing, zip-line or abseiling. In 2017, an obstacle course was organized between participants of the Land Trophy and of The Sand Trophy: The Mud Contest.\n\nCreated in 2007, this trophy is divided in more than 80 teams of 5 to 9 individuals. There are competitions of beach soccer, beach rugby and beach volleyball during the day and concerts in the evening. The competitors spend all of their time on the Village with their teammates and other teams. They can rent a stand of 16m2 to represent their school and their sponsors and organize activities in it such as fast-food contest or a petanque tournament. \n\nIn 2017, the Sand Trophy evolved for its 10th edition. The day is divided into two parts. One part is for classical sporting challenges and the other for more various challenges with, for example, an escape game, an archer arena and a nautic trophy.\n\nThe latest Trophy, which last took place in 2016, was a competition of kitesurfing and windsurfing. Initiated in Lorient in 2011 and officially launched in 2012 during the 44th edition, the trophy was the first kitesurfing competition in teams ever organized in France. The windsurfing competition was divided into two different elements: A race and a freestyle contest. The kitesurfing was divided into a race, a freestyle and a boarder cross contest.\n\nThe EDHEC Sailing Cup is an event organized by students for students. Indeed, the entire event is organized by students, from the logistic to the communication of the event and its 3 trophies. Divided into four divisions, - Logistic, Sports, External Relations and Communication - with a head office, the association works likes a real SME, with presidents that devote their whole gap year to this mission.\n"}

{"id": "13725362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13725362", "title": "Ground ball pitcher", "text": "Ground ball pitcher\n\nIn baseball, a ground ball pitcher (also ground-ball pitcher or groundball pitcher) is a type of pitcher that has a tendency to induce ground balls from opposing batters. The average ground ball pitcher has a ground ball rate of at least 50% with extreme ground ball pitchers maintaining a ground ball rate of around 55%. Pitchers with a ground ball rate lower than 50% may be classified as flyball pitchers or as pitchers who exhibit the tendencies of both ground ball and fly ball pitchers. Ground ball pitchers rely on pitches that are low in the strike zone with substantial downward movement, such as splitters and sinker balls.\n\nBaseball analysts and sabermetricians Tom Tango, Mitchel Lichtman, and Andrew Dolphin agree that ground ball pitchers are generally better pitchers than those with fly ball tendencies. Meanwhile, baseball writer and analyst Bill James argues the opposite because of injury patterns among ground ball pitchers.\n\nAgainst a ground ball pitcher, batters tend to ground out rather than fly out. A ground ball pitcher’s ability to keep balls in the infield in turn keeps balls from resulting in home runs which, according to Hardball Times writer David Gassko, is the strongest benefit of a ground ball pitcher. When a ground ball pitcher does allow a pitch to be bat into the air, it is likely to result in a line drive.\n\nCompared to fly ball pitchers, ground ball pitchers generally allow fewer extra base hits yet more total hits. Likewise, ground ball pitchers tend to give up fewer home runs than fly ball pitchers.\nGround ball pitchers tend to perform better against ground ball hitters than they perform against fly ball hitters.\n\nCompared to fly ball pitchers, ground ball pitchers are more likely to allow unearned runs. David Gassko notes that 2.23% of ground balls result in an error, and these errors account for 85% of all errors. Accordingly, as Gassko argues, the susceptibility of ground balls to errors results in more unearned runs.\n\nWith runners on base, ground ball pitchers often force double plays because the weak contact batters make with a ground ball pitcher’s pitches prevents the ball from passing the infield defense.\n\nGround ball rate, or ground ball percentage, is the percentage of batted balls that are hit as ground balls against a pitcher. A typical ground ball pitcher has a ground ball rate over 50% while an extreme ground ball pitcher maintains a ground ball rate of 55% or higher. Pitchers with high ground ball rates sustain lower BABIP, or Batting Average against Balls in Play (Hardball), on ground balls than those with low ground ball rates.\n\nGround ball pitchers rely on pitches that are likely to induce weak contact from the batter, thus resulting in a ground ball. Pitches that are low in the strike zone with high negative horizontal or vertical movement and high velocity, such as splitters, sinkers, curveballs, and two-seam fastballs, result in the highest percentage of ground balls. According to data from the 2012 major league season, splitters and sinker balls result in the highest percentages of ground balls compared to other pitches, with 50.3% and 49.8%, respectively.\n\nThe sinker ball has an ability to “dive” at the plate, often resulting in ground balls. Several ground ball pitchers such as Tim Hudson, Greg Maddux, Derek Lowe, Chien-Ming Wang, Brandon Webb, and Jake Westbrook rely heavily on their sinker pitches and may often be considered sinkerballers. Self-proclaimed ground ball pitcher Zach Day has indicated that his primary pitch is a sinker ball as well.\n\nTim Hudson notes that he transformed from a strikeout pitcher to a ground ball pitcher because of the capabilities of his sinker ball. He also notes that he feels double plays are easy to force with a ground ball. \nAs of 1998, 72% of balls put in play against Greg Maddux resulted in ground balls, who often relies on a sinker ball.\nIn June 2002, Lowe allowed eleven fly balls to 129 batters, relying on his sinker to induce ground balls. \nAccording to a scouting report by Lewis Shaw, Brandon Webb’s sinker possesses heavy downward movement and high velocity, and one of his notable tendencies is to induce ground balls from right-handed hitters.\n\nIn a World Series game on October 21, 1996, against the New York Yankees, then-Atlanta Braves pitcher Greg Maddux pitched one fly ball and eighteen ground balls, earning nineteen of twenty-four outs on ground balls with Wade Boggs grounding into a double play. Yankees’ catcher Joe Girardi said of Maddux’s performance, “[H]e has a great sinker and he gets a lot of ground balls.” Braves center fielder Marquis Grissom noted, “He [Maddux] works fast. His games are not boring, by no means. That’s his style of pitching. He’s a ground ball pitcher.”\n\nBaseball writer Murray Chass noted the similarities between this World Series game and a World Series game Maddux pitched against the Cleveland Indians a year prior, which resulted in a loss by the Indians, who scored two unearned runs. In this game, Maddux earned nineteen ground outs and pitched two fly balls.\n\nIn game three of the American League Championship Series between the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox in 2007, Indians pitcher Jake Westbrook used his sinker ball to induce fifteen ground ball outs and also forced two 6-4-3 double plays.\n\n\n"}

Which team begins play is determined by \"flipping the disc\", an action similar to a coin toss, but using the disc itself. One member of the team is then selected to start play. That member then raises an arm to indicate readiness to throw, at which point the members of the opposing team freeze in position. The thrower then throws the disc as hard as possible at someone on the opposing team. If the thrower misses the \"scoring area\" (a demarcated area a bit larger than the space occupied by the opposing team), the receiving team scores a point. If a member of the receiving team catches the disc cleanly, neither team scores a point. If the throw is within the scoring area and the receiving team fails to catch, or catches but drops the disc, the throwing team gets a point. The receiving team then picks up the disc and becomes the throwing team.\n\nThe receiving team must catch the disc cleanly in one hand, and may not move from position until after the disc leaves the hand of the thrower. The disc may not be trapped between the hand and any other part of the body, including the other hand. This frequently results in a challenging sequence of \"tips\" or \"bobbles\", which are rebounds of the disc off of receivers' hands or body to slow the disc down and keep it in play until it can be caught. This often involves multiple players on the receiving team.\n\nPlay continues until at least 21 points have been scored by one of the teams and there is a difference in score of at least 2 points.\n\nThe first International Frisbee Tournament was held in Eagle Harbor, Michigan, in 1958. The sport grew from a pastime of the Healy family picnic and, in the 1960s, its national profile was increased by Jim Boggio Sr.\n\nAs guts evolved during the 1960s, players started throwing faster and faster, until it wasn’t unusual to see presumably unbreakable discs traveling at 60–70 mph shatter on impact with an unlucky defender’s hand. Catching a speeding disc directly was said to really \"take guts\", thus the name of the game. One tournament player even required fifteen stitches to close a gaping wound across the palm of his hand.\n\nBy the early 1970s, the game had spread across the United States and to other countries, with coverage on radio, television, major newspapers, and magazines such as \"Time\".\n\nWith over 60 teams at a tournament in the heyday of the game, matches became intensely competitive affairs, seeking the IFT’s Julius T. Nachazel Trophy. With radical curving shots, deflected Frisbees bobbled frantically among teammates, and spectacular diving catches, guts had become an extreme sport demanding fast reflexes, physical endurance, and concentration.\n\nSince its rise in the 1970s, when even ABC’s \"Wide World of Sports\" was televising guts action, and numerous tournaments were springing up, from Toronto to Chicago and Los Angeles, the sport has gradually declined in popularity in America. Guts had been introduced in Asia by the toy company Wham-O in the 1970s, and by the 1990s it had become even more popular in Japan and Taiwan than in the US. Recent years, however, have seen pockets of strong new American players renewing competitive American interest in the game, also drawing some older players out of “retirement”.[Citation needed]\n\nThe sport's international governing body, as with other major flying disc games, is the World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF). For North America, the more game-specific United States Guts Players Association (USGPA) officiates.\n\nThe fiftieth annual International Frisbee Tournament (IFT), held in Hancock, Michigan, June 30 – July 1, 2007, was a large guts disc tournament, drawing players from all over the United States and Canada, and for the first time, two strong teams from Japan – including “Katon”, the WFDF World Champions.\n\nAs of 2007, the USGPA plans to induct some of the most outstanding players into the Guts Hall of Fame, joining Fred Morrison (inventor of the original Pluto Platter flying disc), the Healy brothers (inventors of guts and founders of the IFT), and “Steady Ed” Headrick (IFT champion and inventor of the standard “pole hole” basket used on modern disc golf courses).\n\nDodge disc (or dodge Frisbee). In this variant, scoring is achieved not by throwing into a scoring zone, but by hitting opponents, without their successfully catching the disc. Opponents are permitted to move. As in dodgeball, if a player is hit by a disc and fails to catch it, then the player is \"out\" and exits the field of play. If a player catches the thrown disc without its touching the ground, either before or after being hit by it, or before or after it hits another player, then the player who threw the disc is out instead. The game ends when there is only one player left. The game usually ends with a \"shootout\" between two players, each with several discs. The final players tend to execute several simultaneous \"attacks\" until one is hit without catching a disc thrown by the opponent. A variant of the game, Dodgebee, is a trademark of Hero Discs. The Dodgebee disc is very soft, and thus can be thrown very fast without injuring any of the players.\n\nFlutterguts is a noncompetitive variant of guts. The two teams face each other a few metres apart. The main rule change is that the disc must be thrown such that it does not rotate about its central axis (i.e. it can flip, but it cannot spin). This restriction makes fast throws impossible, but catching is still challenging.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18974249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18974249", "title": "Pedestrianism", "text": "Pedestrianism\n\nPedestrianism was a 19th-century form of competitive walking, often professional and funded by wagering, from which the modern sport of racewalking developed.\n\nDuring the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, pedestrianism, like running or horse racing (equestrianism) was a popular spectator sport in the British Isles. Pedestrianism became a fixture at fairs – much like horse racing – developing from wagers on footraces, rambling, and 17th-century footman wagering. Sources from the late 17th and early 18th century in England describe aristocrats pitting their carriage footmen, constrained to walk by the speed of their masters' carriages, against one another. \n\nThe first notable exponent of this long distance walking is generally considered to be Foster Powell (1734–93) who in 1773 walked from London to York and back, and in 1788 walked in 21 hours 35 minutes. By the end of the 18th century, and especially with the growth of the popular press, feats of foot travel over great distances (similar to a modern Ultramarathon) gained attention, and were labelled \"pedestrianism\".\n\nOne of the most famous pedestrians of the day was Captain Robert Barclay Allardice, called \"The Celebrated Pedestrian\", of Stonehaven. His most impressive feat was to walk every hour for 1000 hours, which he achieved between June 1 and July 12 1809. The feat captured the public's imagination and around 10,000 people came to watch over the course of the event. During the 19th century, attempts to repeat the athletic challenge were made by many pedestrians, including George Wilson who attempted to walk in 480 hours in 1815 but was arrested after 3/4 of the distance for disturbing the peace. Emma Sharp was thought to be the first woman to complete the challenge of in 1000 hours on the 29th October 1864. Later racewalkers proved to be more successful, especially Ada Anderson, who after walking in 1000 hours was labelled by the press 'Champion Lady Walker of the World', a feat only equaled by one other, her trainer William Gale.\nAnother popular goal was for competitors in long distance events to walk in less than 24 hours, from which they earned the nickname \"centurions\". Enormous cash prizes were offered for the races and they were a popular activity for the press, crowds of working class spectators, and the betting public until the 1880s.\n\nInterest in the sport, and the wagering that accompanied it, spread to the United States, Canada, and Australia in the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, pedestrianism was largely displaced by the rise in modern spectator sports and by controversy involving rules, which limited its appeal as a source of wagering and led to its inclusion in the amateur athletics movement and eventually the creation of racewalking.\n\nPedestrianism was first codified in the last half of the 19th century, evolving into what became racewalking, while diverging from the long distance cross country fell running, other track and field athletics, and recreational hiking or hillwalking. By the mid-19th century, competitors were often expected to extend their legs straight at least once in their stride and obey what was called the \"fair heel and toe\" rule. This rule, the source of modern racewalking, was a vague commandment that the toe of one foot could not leave the ground before the heel of the next foot touched down, however rules were customary and changed with competition. Racers were usually allowed to jog in order to fend off cramps, and it was distance, not code, which determined gait for longer races. Newspaper reports suggest that \"trotting\" was common in events.\n\nThe longer form of \"ultra marathon\" walking featured in the popular press and in the decade after the American Civil War in the United States was a source of fascination. Edward Payson Weston, a reporter for the New York Herald won a $10,000 prize by walking from Portland, Maine, to Chicago in 30 days in 1867. In the United States a series of women's competitions were staged, special indoor tracks were built in some towns, and intra-community long distance pedestrianism came into vogue. Along with sensational feats of distance, gambling was a central attraction for the large, mostly working-class crowds which came to pedestrian events. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, member of Parliament Sir John Astley founded a \"Long Distance Championship of the World\" in 1878, staged over six days, which became known as the \"Astley Belt Races\". While marking a peak in press coverage of such races, the Astley Belt Races allowed a wide interpretation of rules, with trotting, jogging, and even some running allowed. The competition was partly inspired by a desire to clean up the perception of the sport as corrupted by gambling interests and led to a push amongst some to codify pedestrianism as an amateur sport. The same process was happening to British track and field athletics and gave rise to the modern Olympic Movement.\n\nWalkers organised the first English amateur walking championship in 1866, which was won by John Chambers, and judged by the \"fair heel and toe\" rule. This vague code was the basis for the rules codified at the first championships meeting in 1880 of the Amateur Athletics Association in England, the birth of modern track and field. With football, cricket and other sports codified in the 19th century, the transition from professional pedestrianism to amateur codified racewalking was part of a process of regularisation occurring in most modern sports at this time.\n\nThe codified racewalk was included when the International Olympic Committee formed in 1893. In the 1904 Olympic Games the \"all-rounder\" event, father of the decathlon, included an walk. It was only in the unofficial \"Interim Olympic Games\" of 1906 that racewalking became a separate event and since the 1908 Olympic Games in London, it has been an official event in every summer games.\n\nFoot racing was a form of competitive running and walking of the 17th and early 18th centuries. Usually it involved feats of endurance which would now be classified as ultramarathon. It evolved into pedestrianism.\n\n\n"}

Sandboarding can also be practised sitting down or lying on the belly or the back. It typically involves a sandboard, although it is also possible to use sleds, surfboards, a skateboard deck, or snowboards.\n\nSandboarding has adherents throughout the world, but is most prevalent in desert areas or coastal areas with beach dunes. It is less popular than snowboarding, partly because it is very difficult to build a mechanised ski lift on a sand dune, meaning participants must walk or ride a dune buggy or all-terrain vehicle back to the top of the dune. On the other hand, dunes are normally available year-round as opposed to ski resorts, which are seasonal.\n\nThe sandboard base is much harder than a snowboard, and is built mostly out of formica or laminex with special base materials now being made for this sport. To glide in the sand, the board bottom is often waxed, usually with a paraffin-based sandboard wax, before a run. Afterwards, the bottom of the board may have a lightly sanded look to it, while 'Race Base' tends to polish smoother and glossier with use. Most terrain sandboards are composed of hardwood ply, while 'full-size' sandboards are a wood, fiber glass, and plastic composite. However, a snowboarding base will sometimes work on steeper dunes.\n\nDrorbamidbar has sandboarding in Israel at Negev Desert not far from Ashalim in the Ramat Negev.\n\nLittle Sahara on Kangaroo Island in South Australia is a sand dune system roughly covering two square kilometres. The highest dune is approximately 70 metres above sea level.\n\nLucky Bay, about 30 km south of Kalbarri, in Western Australia, is another sandboarding hotspot. Sandboarding Tours are offered in the area.\n\nThe Stockton dunes, 2.3 hours north from Sydney. Stockton Bight Sand Dunes system is up to one kilometre wide, 32 kilometres long, and covers an area of over 4,200 hectares. The massive sand dunes climb up to 40 metres high. Located only minutes from the centre of Nelson Bay, it is the largest sand dune system in Australia.\n\nSandboarding sites in Egypt include the Great Sand Sea near Siwa Oasis واحة سيوة in Egypt's Western Desert, the Qattaniya القطانية sand dunes (1.5 hr drive on/off-road from Cairo), El Safra الصفراء and Hadudah هدودة dunes midway between Dahab and St. Catherine in Sinai. \n\nNamibia features sand-skiing, which is similar to sandboarding, performed with skis instead of a board. Most of the sand-skiing is performed in the Namib desert dunes around Swakopmund and Walvis Bay. With a special permit it is sometimes possible to sand-ski at the world's highest dunes in Sossusvlei. Henrik May, a German living in Namibia for some 10 years, set a Guinness World Record in speed sand-skiing on 6 June 2010. He reached a speed of 92.12 km/h.\n\nAfter some pioneers like Derek Bredenkamp who boarded Swakopmund around 1974, commercial operators in South Africa began offering sandboarding to tourists in 1994. In 2000 the Sandboarding South Africa league was established. \nBetween 2002 and 2004 the South African Sandboarding League held competitions on the Matterhorn Dune located between Swakopmund and Walvis bay. Competition events included dual slalom, boarder cross and big air events. In 2005 and 2006 Alter Action held sandboarding competitions at Matterhorn but the competitions no longer formed part of the South African Sandboarding League during those years. The league collapsed, then the sport was revived again in 2007 with weekly sandboarding sessions in and around Cape Town and Gauteng. \n\nSand Master Park, located in Florence, Oregon USA is a sandboard park with of private sculpted sand dunes and a full-time pro shop. Dune Riders International is the governing body for competitive sandboarding worldwide and sanctions three events each season at Sand Master Park.\n\nGreat Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve near Alamosa, Colorado has sandboarding on what it calls the tallest dunes in North America. Sandboarding and skiing are permitted anywhere on the dunefield away from vegetated areas. \n\nPeru is known for having large sand dunes in Ica, some reaching up to 2 km. Duna Grande in Ica is the largest sand dune in the world. The \"Copa Sandboarding Perú\" (Peru – Sandboarding Cup) has been held near Paracas every year since 2009. There are also great dunes near the capital city (Lima) in Chilca.\n\nIn Chile, sandboarding is practiced throughout the north of the country, including the Medanoso dunes in Copiapo (where the Dakar rally takes place), Puerto Viejo beach in Caldera, excellent dunes in Iquique, and some near Viña del Mar.\n\nNicaragua is home to Cerro Negro, the youngest volcano in Central America. Since it has steep slopes and volcanic sand, it is possible to sandboard down this active volcano.\n\nA rather small sand mountain is the Monte Kaolino in Hirschau, Germany. Being equipped with a lift to the 120m top it is also the host of the annual Sandboarding World Championships. \n\nAmothines is a small desert five kilometres from Katalakkos village in Limnos, Greece. There are many sand dunes there, where people can practice sandboarding.\n\nIn the North East region of the United Kingdom, there is a small beach at Seaton Sluice where people can sandboard. This is a good alternative to sledding, as there is insufficient snow to support sledding there, even though the UK has a cold climate, with cold winters and cool summers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23587058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23587058", "title": "Wide Right II", "text": "Wide Right II\n\nWide Right II is a colloquial name for the 1992 college football game between the Miami Hurricanes and Florida State Seminoles. The game is notable in the Florida State–Miami football rivalry and derives its name from the colloquial name Wide Right I, played during the immediately preceding season. Like its predecessor, the game had decisive national championship implications and ended with a Florida State kicker missing a game-altering field goal in the waning seconds.\n\nMiami entered the October 3, 1992, matchup of intrastate rivals as the defending national champion and second-ranked team in the country, riding a 20-game winning streak. Miami, however, appeared to be vulnerable, as Hurricane Andrew had disrupted the early portion of its schedule and Miami was unimpressive in surviving an 8-7 scare against the Arizona Wildcats the week prior. Because of Miami's lackluster performance against Arizona, the Hurricanes lost their number one ranking in the AP Poll and were dropped to number two, behind the Washington Huskies. Nevertheless, Miami featured a bevy of stars on its roster, including Heisman Trophy candidate quarterback Gino Torretta, wide receiver Lamar Thomas, and linebackers Jessie Armstead and Micheal Barrow, and the team was in the midst of an NCAA-record 58-game home winning streak at the Orange Bowl. Florida State was looking to avenge its loss to Miami in Wide Right I the season before.\n\nFlorida State came strong out of the gate, as Tamarick Vanover took the opening kickoff back 94 yards for a touchdown. Miami struck back in the second quarter with a 24-yard Dane Prewitt field goal and a 29-yard touchdown pass from Gino Torretta to Coleman Bell, taking the lead, 10-7. Florida State countered with a 22-yard field goal by Dan Mowrey, and the teams headed to the locker room deadlocked at 10.\n\nMowrey added a 38-yard field goal in the third quarter and a 41-yarder early in the fourth. Leading 16-10 with just over 9 minutes to play, the Seminoles found themselves in a position eerily similar to the season before: a 6-point lead late in the game and a field goal kicker who was 3-for-3 on the day.\n\nMiami responded as it did the season before, going on a 7-play, 58-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Torretta to Lamar Thomas. Torretta was drilled as he released the ball, but Thomas was able to sneak behind Clifton Abraham and make a basket catch. With the extra point, Miami seized the lead, 17-16.\n\nMiami's defense held on the next possession, and the Florida State defense forced a punt on Miami's subsequent series. The ensuing punt proved disastrous for the Seminoles: punt returner Corey Sawyer was penalized for attempting an illegal forward pass from his own end zone, resulting in a safety for Miami. With Miami now leading 19-16, a field goal could only tie the game for the Seminoles. The Miami defense again held, but Florida State then forced the 'Canes to punt, giving the Seminoles one last chance with 1:35 left.\n\nQuarterback Charlie Ward drove the Seminoles 59 yards and into field goal range, converting a crucial fourth-and-12 with a completion to Kez McCorvey along the way. The drive was highlighted by Matt Frier's diving, fingertip reception for 17 yards. After Ward picked up 19 yards on two quick scrambles, the Seminoles were on the Miami 22-yard line but nearly out of time. On the game's final play, Florida State called upon Mowrey to make a 39-yard field goal and tie the game at 19. With both Miami's and Florida State's national championship hopes again hanging in the balance, Mowrey, kicking into the open end of the Orange Bowl, missed wide right and collapsed face down onto the turf.\n\nMiami once again used a hard-fought win over its rival as a springboard for a national championship run, winning its final seven regular season games and earning a berth in the 1993 Sugar Bowl as the nation's number one team in both the AP and Coaches' Polls. This time, however, the Hurricanes could not complete the perfect season, losing to the second-ranked and eventual national champion Alabama Crimson Tide in the Sugar Bowl 34-13, and finishing 11-1 and ranked third in the country.\n\nUnlike the previous season, when the Seminoles followed up their loss to Miami with an upset loss to Florida, Florida State rebounded and won the rest of its games, going 11-1 on the season. The Seminoles soundly defeated the Nebraska Cornhuskers in the 1993 Orange Bowl, 27-14, and, despite the loss to Miami, were ranked second in the final polls, one spot ahead of the Hurricanes.\n\nThe game was the second in a peculiar string of 5 games in 12 years in which Florida State lost to Miami due to a late missed field goal that would have won or tied the game for the Seminoles, often with national championship implications.\n"}

He is said to have bowled a \"high delivery on a good length\" and was probably a medium quick bowler.\n\nHis family and that of Thomas Brett were inter-married.

{"id": "26821596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26821596", "title": "Woolwich Cricket Club", "text": "Woolwich Cricket Club\n\nWoolwich Cricket Club was an English cricket club based in the town of Woolwich, Kent. It was formed sometime in the first half of the 18th century, or earlier, and its earliest known record is in 1754 when its team played two major matches against the prominent Dartford Cricket Club. The club, or at least a successor of it, then played a number of matches from 1797 to 1806 against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), Montpelier Cricket Club, Croydon Cricket Club and other leading town clubs. After playing MCC in 1806, the club disappeared from the records. Throughout the period from 1754 to 1806, Woolwich's home ground was Barrack Field, part of Woolwich Common, which remains the home ground of the Royal Artillery Cricket Club (RACC). Mainstays of the club in its \"Napoleonic\" period were William Ayling, John Tanner and John Ward.\n\nWoolwich came briefly to prominence in August 1754 when the team played home and away games against Dartford which at this time was probably the strongest team in England. In both matches, the away team won but no further details are known. Both games were mentioned in the same report by \"Read's Weekly Journal\" dated Sat 31 August: \"Dartford won away & lost at home against Woolwich on Sat. & Mon., Aug. 24 & 26 respectively\". The Woolwich club's ability to successfully challenge Dartford at this time clearly infers that it was a leading club in the 1750s but its new found prominence was short-lived, probably because of the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, during which cricket was impacted with few matches recorded.\n\nIn the years around the turn of the century, club cricket was very fashionable in London and matches between the town clubs were very popular. They generally held important match status, depending on the quality of the teams. Woolwich reappeared in 1797 with two victories against Croydon, both at Barrack Field. \n\nIn 1798, the club played home and away against both Croydon and Montpelier. Following two substantial victories against Croydon, Woolwich lost to Montpelier at Aram's New Ground and then drew the return at Barrack Field.\n\nIn 1800, Woolwich played home and away matches against MCC and won both, including an innings victory at Lord's Old Ground. In what was a very successful season, the team also defeated Montpelier by 8 wickets at Barrack Field.\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars were by now under way and, as in the Seven Years' War, cricket suffered a loss of investment and manpower that severely reduced the number of matches played. Woolwich played three more games against MCC at Lord's Old Ground, winning in 1802 and 1803 but losing by 7 wickets in 1806.\n\nThe \"CricketArchive\" database records 96 matches, mostly services fixtures, as having taken place at Barrack Field but this record is incomplete because it excludes 8 matches played between 1797 and 1802, all of which are listed below:\n\n\nThe list is by no means exhaustive as ongoing research may find references to other matches at the ground.\n\nIt is possible that Woolwich CC was merged into the RACC or alternatively that it disbanded after the RACC took full possession of Barrack Field. According to its own website, RACC first played cricket in 1765, having been started as a private club by Royal Artillery officers. It was formally constituted as a regimental club as late as 1906. On 8 June 1818, RACC became the first services team to be granted a match against MCC at Lord's. A week later, RACC played MCC at Barrack Field in a match that was tied. \n\nOn 21–23 August 1862, RACC hosted the All-England Eleven (AEE) in an odds match. The venue is given as Woolwich Common, not Barrack Field. RACC had 22 players but still lost by 6 wickets to a team captained by George Parr and including great players John Jackson, H. H. Stephenson, Ned Willsher and Tom Hayward senior.\n\n"}
