The film was financially successful, grossing $4 million in its opening weekend and totaling $27.8 million in its run against an estimated $3 million budget.\n\nNorm Snively, an alcoholic and bumbling clown, and his Golden Retriever Old Blue are doing a show at a child's birthday party. After Blue causes havoc at the party, Snively angrily takes him in a kennel to a dog pound (though it was the latter's own fault for throwing a ball that was too big for the former's mouth), until the kennel falls out of his truck, rendering Blue homeless. Meanwhile, 12-year-old Josh Framm has relocated with his mother Jackie and two-year-old sister Andrea from Virginia to Fernfield, Washington. Due to heartbreak over the death of his father, a pilot who died in a plane crash during a test flight due to fuel shortage, he is too shy to try out for his middle school's basketball team or to make any friends. He instead becomes the basketball team's manager, an awkward offer by Coach Joe Barker which he accepts. He practices basketball by himself in a makeshift court that he sets up in an abandoned allotment, where he meets Blue and renames him Buddy. Josh soon discovers that Buddy has the uncanny ability to play basketball, and decides to let Buddy come home with him.\n\nJackie agrees to let him keep Buddy until Christmas and she plans to send him to the pound if his rightful owner is not located; however, she sees how loyal Buddy is and how much Josh loves him. On Christmas, Jackie lets Josh keep Buddy as a present.\n\nFollowing Christmas, Josh finds a tryout invitation in his locker and further realizes Buddy's talent when he discovers that he can actually shoot a hoop. These facts together prompt Josh to try out, and he gets a place on the team. At his first game, he befriends teammate Tom Stewart, but earns the disdain of star player and team bully Larry Willingham. Meanwhile, Buddy leaves the backyard, goes to the school and shows up while the game is underway. He runs into the court, disrupts the game, and causes mayhem, but the audience loves him after he scores a basket.\n\nBuddy is later caught by Josh after the game. Soon after, the dog witnesses Coach Barker abusing Tom by violently pelting him with basketballs in an attempt to make him catch better. He leads Josh, Jackie, and the school principal Ms. Pepper to the scene. As a result, Barker is fired and replaced by the school's kind-hearted engineer, former NBA player Arthur Chaney, at Josh's suggestion. As the new basketball coach, Chaney starts implementing changes in the team, including benching Larry during a game for constant ball-hogging. Angry by Chaney's decision, Buck Willingham, Larry's overbearing father, forces Larry to leave the team. Buddy becomes the mascot of the school's basketball team and begins appearing in their halftime shows. After the Timberwolves lose one game, the team has subsequent success and qualifies for the State Final.\n\nJust before the championship game, Snively appears after seeing Buddy on television. Hoping to profit out of Buddy's newfound fame, he forces Jackie to hand over Buddy, using papers proving that he is Buddy's legal owner. Knowing they do not have a choice, Jackie forces Josh to give Buddy back to Snively. After noticing that he's feeling withdrawn and depressed, Jackie regrets making Josh give up Buddy. Josh decides to rescue Buddy, suspecting he's being abused by Snively. He sneaks into Snively's backyard and finds Buddy chained up and abused again. Snively catches Josh escaping with Buddy, and pursues them in his dilapidated clown truck before crashing into a lake. Josh then decides to set Buddy free in the forest to find a new home. Initially, his team is losing at the next championship to the opposing team, which Larry turns out to have joined. Then Buddy returns for a joyful reunion for Josh and the team. When it is discovered that there is no rule that a dog can't play basketball, Buddy joins the roster and leads the team to a come from behind championship victory, with Josh scoring the game-winning buzzer beater.\n\nSnively arrives and attempts to sue the Framm family for custody of Buddy, despite that his ownership papers were ruined when he crashed into the lake. Upon seeing Buddy, Judge Cranfield is disgusted and initially reluctant to judge a case over a dog, but agrees only under a strict condition that the case be executed seriously. During the trial, Josh protests against letting Snively have Buddy, mentioning the abuse that Buddy has suffered under him, including chaining Buddy to his fence. Jackie also protests, mentioning that Buddy was much happier with their family, and that she too has seen how abusive Snively is. After hearing a number of people protest against Snively, Cranfield doesn't believe that neither one has any real evidence in claiming ownership to Buddy. Soon, Chaney arrives and suggests that Buddy chooses his owner. As a fan of Chaney, Cranfield accepts his proposal and moves the court outside to the front lawn for Buddy to choose. After Buddy rips up the rolled-up newspaper that Snively had always abused him with, Buddy chooses Josh. When Snively angrily attempts to get Buddy back by force, police officers quickly take him away and arrest him, while Josh and the rest of the citizens rejoice and gather around Buddy to welcome him to his new home.\n\nMuch of the on-set dog motivation (not training) were performed by Justin Sherbert (formally Justin Sherman) of Free Willy fame. The animals were pet and treated with respect by Sherbert who noted, \"motivating these dogs is significantly easier than teaching a whale to flip.\" Sherbert remains the canine motivator at large for the Air Bud franchise.\n\n\"Air Bud\" was released to VHS on December 23, 1997, and to DVD on February 3, 1998 (with an open matte aspect ratio). It was released again on March 3, 2009, in a special edition DVD set that presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio. The special edition DVD also includes commentary from Buddy and his puppies, as the series had introduced speaking animals by that time. It was released direct-to-video in October 1999 in the UK by Warner Home Video under the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews. It holds a Rotten Tomatoes score of 45% based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10.\n\nThe film generated one theatrical sequel, three direct-to-video sequels and a spin-off film series. In each film, Buddy learns to play a different sport while the spin offs focus on Buddy's children, the Buddies.\n\n"}

A king so threatened is said to be \"in check\". A player must get out of check, if possible, by interposing a piece between the threatening piece and the king, capturing the threatening piece, or moving the king to a square where it is no longer in check. If the player cannot move out of check, the game ends in checkmate and the player loses. Players cannot make any move that puts their own king in check.\nA check is the result of a move that places the opposing king under an immediate threat of capture by at least one of the player's pieces. Making a move that checks is sometimes called \"giving check\". If the king is in check and the checked player has no legal move to get out of check, the king is checkmated and the player loses.\n\nUnder the standard rules of chess, a player may not make any move that places or leaves their king in check. A player may move the king, capture the threatening piece, or block the check with another piece. A king cannot itself directly check the opposing king, since this would place the first king in check as well. A move of the king could expose the opposing king to a discovered check by another piece, however.\n\nIn informal games, it is customary to announce \"check\" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.\n\nIn some variations of chess, such as Losing chess, a player can move into check. In fast chess, a player is permitted to leave their king in check, which results in them losing the game.\n\nThere may be up to three possible ways to get a king out of a single check on the following move:\n\nIn the position in the first diagram, White can get out of check by any of three methods:\n\nIf a king is placed in double check, the king must get out of both checks on the following move. Since it is impossible to capture both checking pieces or block both lines of attack in a single move, a double check can be escaped only by moving the king out of check.\n\nIf none of these possibilities can get the king out of check, then it is checkmated and the game is lost by the checkmated player.\nA simple and very common type of check is when a piece moves to directly attack the opposing king only by itself. Sometimes such a check is part of a chess tactic such as a fork, a skewer, or a discovered attack on another piece. In some cases, a check can be used to defend against such tactics.\n\nThere are also a few more special types of check:\n\nIn friendly games, the checking player customarily says \"check\" when making a checking move. Announcing \"check\" is not required under the rules of chess and it is usually not done in formal games. Until the early 20th century a player was expected to announce \"check\", and some sources of rules even required it .\n\nIn algebraic chess notation, a checking move is recorded like any other move, except that a \"+\" is normally written after the move.\n\nIn the FIDE rules for rapid chess, if a player leaves their king in check or commits any other illegal move their opponent can claim a win.\n\nLess commonly (and obsolete), the warning \"garde\" can be said when a player directly attacks the opponent's queen in a similar way. This was mostly abandoned in the 19th century . The same move can be both \"check\" and \"garde\" simultaneously. Before the queen acquired its current move (about 1495) the rook was the most powerful piece. At that time the term \"check-rook\" was used for a move that checked the king and attacked a rook at the same time .\n\nSometimes checking an opponent provides no benefit to the checking player. This is called a \"useless check\" and it may even provide the checked opponent with a tempo (move opportunity) to move the king into a safer position . For example, 1.e4 e6 2.d4 Bb4+? does nothing for Black and in fact causes him to lose a tempo after 3.c3! A check given with the sole intention of delaying an inevitable defeat by one move is referred to as a \"spite check\", and may be considered somewhat unsporting .\n\nThere are many instances, however, when checking the opponent's king may be a useful tactic or part of a tactic, either in attacking or in defense. Checking is often used in combinations with many other tactics or simply to force an opponent into a position where the opposing king can be checkmated, otherwise taken advantage of, or is otherwise worse for the opponent. Some attacks involve numerous checks to force an opponent into a losing position, especially when the king is exposed. An unexpected check in a forced combination or an overlooked cross-check in a planned series of checks may serve as sort of a zwischenzug, foiling the plan.\n\nSome uses of checking:\n\nIn early Sanskrit chess (c. 500–700) the king could be and this ended the game. The Persians (c. 700–800) introduced the idea of warning that the king was under attack (announcing \"check\" in modern terminology). This was done to avoid the early and accidental end of a game. Later the Persians added the additional rule that a king could not be moved into check or left in check. As a result, the king could not be captured .\n\nIn this usage, the words \"check\" and \"chess\" come via Arabic from Persian \"shāh\", meaning \"king\" or \"monarch\" .\n\n\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "33304580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33304580", "title": "Circle rules football", "text": "Circle rules football\n\nCircle rules football, commonly referred to as circle rules, is a sport played between two teams of six with a large spherical ball similar to a stability ball. Invented in New York City in 2006, the sport is currently played in cities across the United States, as well as in several international locations.\n\nThe game is played on a circular field with a central goal. The goal has no net, as the two teams score through the goal from opposing directions. Around the goal is a circular area called the “key,” which only the teams’ goalies may enter. Players outside the key may touch the ball with any part of their bodies, allowing them to dribble, kick, roll, carry, and throw the ball; however, they may not hold the ball in any way that restricts its movement. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins.\n\nEach team consists of six players (excluding substitutes), one of whom is the goalkeeper. Teams may be coed, though they are not required to be. Two referees are on the field at all times; one watches over the key to call key violations and ensure the safety of the goalies, while the other moves freely around the field.\n\nAn official game consists of four fifteen-minute periods. Prior to the start of the game, a representative from each team participates in a \"down-up.\" The two players stand opposite each other; on the referee's signal, they race to touch both shoulder blades to the ground and return to a stationary standing position. As in a coin toss, the winner of the down-up gets to choose which direction his team will score and whether his team will kick off or receive the ball at the start of the match.\n\nThe team that is kicking off gathers inside the key, while the other team takes up their positions outside. After the kick off, the kicking team must wait inside the key until a member of the other team has touched the ball; at this point the kicking team is released from the key, and no players except the goalies may reenter it until a goal has been scored. After each goal, the scoring team gathers inside the key and repeats this procedure.\n\nGoals are scored by putting the ball through the goalposts in a team's designated direction. Each goal is worth one point. Outside the key, players may touch the ball with any part of their body; however, they cannot hold the ball with two hands or hold it against their body in a way that restricts the ball's movement. Players are free to dribble, kick, roll, carry, throw, and strike the ball, and they may move it in any direction around the field.\n\nPhysical contact between players on the field is limited. Incidental contact, as well as contact that is the result of a movement that causes contact with the ball before contact with another player, is generally not penalized. The referees' discretion plays a large role in determining the type and intensity of contact that is allowed on the field.\n\nInside the key, the goalies attempt to defend their own side of the goal, while allowing their team to score through from the opposite direction. Goalies have full contact with each other, allowing them to grapple; however, dangerous moves such as striking and contact above the neck are forbidden. Goalies may leave the key to pursue the ball, but they may not have contact with each other outside the key. Goalies may not score for their own teams.\n\nThe team with the most goals at the end of the match wins. In the event of a tie, two five-minute halves of overtime are played.\n\nThe game is generally played on a circular field of grass or artificial turf, though it can also be played on other surfaces, including pavement and sand. The field is 50 meters in diameter. The goal (four meters wide and three meters high) sits in the center of the field, surrounded by a circular area called the key (8 meters in diameter).\n\nThe goalposts are typically constructed of 3/4 inch PVC piping, a common material found in most hardware stores.\n\nThe spherical ball (55 cm in diameter), made of a soft elastic, closely resembles a stability ball.\n\nThe most common penalties are known as \"key violations.\" Any non-goalkeeper who sets foot inside the key (at any time other than kickoff) receives a 30-second suspension from the game without a replacement. If a non-goalkeeper touches the ball while inside the key, the suspension is extended to 60 seconds. Any player who receives three key violations in one game will be suspended from the game for five minutes without a replacement.\n\nContact violations on the field are similar to soccer or basketball. Inadvertent violations result in a direct kick for the opposing team. Flagrant contact violations result in a 60-second ejection of the offending player and a direct kick. Malicious contact violations result in ejection from the game without replacement. Three violations within a game result in the player being ejected for the remainder of the game, however, they may be replaced after any ejection penalties if the final violation was not malicious.\n\nA penalty may also be called on a player for holding the ball. The penalty for holding is an indirect free kick for the opposing team from the spot of the violation.\n\nCircle rules football was created by Gregory Manley in 2006 as a senior thesis project for the Experimental Theater Wing, a division of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. The project aimed to highlight the similarities between drama and athletics, demonstrating that “everything inherent in theater is inherent in sports.”\n\nThe game has been played regularly in Brooklyn's Prospect Park since its inception. In the spring of 2009, Circle Rules Federation began running an official competitive league in Brooklyn. The first championship title was won by The Flying Mordecais.\n\nAlso in 2009, circle rules football was featured in the Come Out & Play Festival, where it won the \"Most Original Sport\" and \"Best in Festival\" awards; it was also featured at igfest 2009, where it was named \"Best in Festival\" and \"Most Likely to be Played Again.\"\n\nOfficial league play resumed in Brooklyn in 2010, and The Flying Mordecais successfully defended their title. In both the 2011 and 2012 seasons, upstart team The Rebel Rousers went undefeated and claimed the championship.\n\nIn casual matches, a slightly pared down version of the game, known as \"small rules,\" is often played. Small rules is played without goalies, and the width of the goal and the key are reduced to two and six meters, respectively. In this version of the game, players may enter the key, but they still may not touch the ball inside the area—unless their last point of contact with the ground was outside the key (as in the case of a jump or dive). Small rules is typically played with four members per team on the field at a time.\n\nSince fall 2007, an event called the Harvest Tournament has been held annually. For this tournament, a unique 3-on-3 version of small rules is played. The sixth Harvest Tournament took place in Prospect Park on Saturday, October 20, 2012.\n\nIn March 2010, an indoor variation of circle rules football was introduced in London.\n\n"}

When Aalesund opened the stadium, businessman Olav Nils Sunde donated a statue to the club, which was erected in front of the stadium. Whilst Sunde denied it, the statue bore a very strong resemblance to former Aalesund player John Arne Riise. In 2007, when Riise played in the Champions League Final, a Norwegian commentator demanded the statue officially carry his name. Riise himself has said, \"[The name change] is not for me to decide. Everyone sees who it is, and I know that it was made for me.\"\n\nSince 2009 it has also hosted the home games of the Norwegian Women's Premier League side Fortuna Ålesund.

The race was reinstated three times through the years at the initiative of the Aéro-Club de France, and later by Deutsch de la Meurthe's widow Suzanne.\n\nAnnounced in 1906, the first Deutsch de la Meurthe competition was a speed trial intended for all powered aircraft over a distance of 200 kilometres, to be flown as an outward leg of 100 km followed by a return to the starting point. The flight had to be made between 1 March and 31 October, and the performance was recognized only if the previous best performance was surpassed by at least 10%. A bonus of 20,000 francs was awarded each year for the best performance that had remained unsurpassed for eight months. The Coupe (cup), an objet d'art valued at 10,000 francs, was to be given to the first aircraft builder who won three consecutive competitions.\nDespite the substantial prize being offered, it took six years to attract participants. On 12 April 1912, Maurice Tabuteau piloting a 50 hp Gnome-powered Morane-Saulnier monoplane flew the circuit in 1 h 47 min 48 s, despite persistent navigation problems caused by fog. On 1 May 1912 Parisian Emmanuel Hélen completed the course at flying a 70 hp Gnome-powered Nieuport monoplane. Since no other pilot bettered this performance by more than 10% before 31 October 1912, Hélen became the first holder of the Coupe.\n\nOn 27 October 1913 Eugène Gilbert gained first place in the second competition for the Coupe, covering the course at an average speed of in a 160 h.p. Gnome-powered Deperdussin Monocoque.\n\nThe competition was interrupted by the First World War, but on 13 October 1919 it resumed using the same course, but the competition was now open for the entire year, and the trophy would be definitely kept by the first participant whose time remained unbeaten for eight consecutive months. Four aeroplanes participated in this trial: a 180 hp Hispano-Suiza-powered Gourdou-Leseurre monoplane piloted by Rost, a 300 hp Hispano-Suiza-powered SPAD-Herbemont piloted by Joseph Sadi-Lecointe, a 300 hp Hispano-Suiza-powered Nieuport biplane piloted by Bernard Barny de Romanet, and a 180 hp Le Rhöne-powered Nieuport monoplane designed by engineer Mary, and flown by the Danish pilot Leth Jensen. Taking off on 13 October 1919, Jensen flew the circuit at an average speed of 200.001 km/h (57 minutes). The next day, Rost reached an average speed of 210 km/h while de Romanet had an aircraft failure. On 15 October, Sadi-Lecointe flew a first circuit at 223 km/h, and then a second lap at 246.9 km/h and thus became the title holder. On 21 October 1919, de Romanet reached an average speed of 268.631 km/h which was insufficient to be homologated, because this performance was less than 110% of Sadi-Lecointe's performance. He followed it the next day with an average speed of 285.600 km/h which did count. Bad weather then stopped the competition, which was resumed just three months later. On 3 January 1920, Sadi-Lecointe, who had in the meanwhile had left Blériot-SPAD for Nieuport, reached with a Hispano-engined Nieuport-Delage NiD 29V. On 3 August 1920, he became the holder of the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe, his performance having remained unbeaten.\n\nIn 1920, following the ending of the Gordon Bennett Trophy competition due to a third consecutive French victory, the Aéro-Club de France decided to organize a new competition to replace it. This was named \"Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe\" to honour Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe, who had died on 24 November 1919; the competition was funded by his family.\n\nIt remained a speed competition, but was now to be held on a given date. The competition was to be held as 3 laps of a 100 km (62 mi) circuit, with its start at Étampes and a turn made at la Marmogne farm at Gidy. The competition was open for three years and was international, with each country allowed three entrants. A sum of 60,000 francs was to be awarded each year for the best performance, and a cup valued at 20,000 francs given to the winner. In the case of the cup being won outright before the end of the competition, the winner would also received the remaining prize money\n\nThere were seven participants in this race, which was held on 1 October. No eliminating heats were needed to select from the five French pilot entrants, since Count Bernard de Romanet died when the wing fabric of his Lumière-De Monge monoplane detached at high speed during the elimination trials on 23 September, and at the last moment Hanriot withdrew their entrant, the Hanriot HD.22. This was a metal monoplane with retractable landing gear expressly built for the race, and which had been intended to be piloted by Rost. Nieuport entered two Nieuport NiD.29Vs piloted by Sadi-Lecointe and Ferdinand Lasne, and a NiD.41 Sesquiplan was entrusted to Georges Kirsch. A 700 hp Fiat-powered Fiat biplane piloted by Francesco Brack Papa represented Italy, and British pilot Herbert James flew a 450 hp Napier Lion-powered Gloster Mars I (G-EAXZ).\nA broken propeller forced Sadi-Lecointe to make a forced landing in a beet field at Cernonville, injuring an eye and both legs in the process. The wing fabric of James' aeroplane was torn away, and he had to make a forced landing. Brach Papa established a new Italian speed record, but the engine exploded before the finish. Thus, only two Nieuport pilots were left to finish the race, Georges Kirsch winning with a speed of 282.75 km/h (a new world speed record for a distance of 300 km); Fernand Lasne's speed was 259.03 km/h.\n\nThe 1921 circuit remained unchanged for the 1922 competition, which was held on 30 September. Nieuport-Astra entered a Nieuport NiD.29V piloted by Lasne and the sesquiplane piloted by Sadi-Lecointe, Jean Casale was piloting a Blériot-SPAD S.58, a design based on the S.41 fighter. Fiat and Gloster were presenting the same machines and pilots as the preceding year. Assigned to their factory pilot Berthelin, who was new to this competition, the NiD.41 was retired at the last moment. The tailless Simplex aircraft which was supposed to be piloted by Georges Madon had an accident during its tests, and Charles Nungesser was absent.\nIn his Nieuport sesquiplane named \"Eugène Gilbert\" (race number 5), Sadi-Lecointe covered the first 100 km at an average speed of 325 km/h (a new closed circuit speed record), but a spark plug popped out of its cylinder and passed through the engine cowling as he was turning around the airport pylon. The pilot was therefore forced to land, and the airplane hit a gutter which turned the aircraft on its back without injuring the pilot. James lost his maps during his flight and unable to find the turning point returned to the start. Jean Casale's SPAD S.58 \"Louis Blériot\" (race no.3) was victim of a radiator leak, and made a forced landing at Étampes and was unable to finish the race, as was also the case for Brack-Papa's Fiat R.700 which had a fuel pump failure. The first lap made by the Italian pilot at 288 km/h (179 mph) was not homologated since the aircraft had flown behind the time-keepers at the starting point, but he was offered a second attempt. Brack-Papa started a second time but retired when he realized he would not be able to beat Lasne, ) who won the competition with an average speed of 289.90 km/h.\n\nIn 1931 Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe initiated a new competition for the Coupe, which was contested for the first time on 29 May 1933. The trial was to be run in two 1,000 km stages separated by a 90 minutes refuelling stop, and was limited to aircraft with an engine capacity of less than eight litres. The starting point of the race was still at Étampes. Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe was offering one million Francs, and the Ministère de l'Air (Air Ministry) offered another three million.\n\nOn 24 May 1933 Captain Ludovic Arrachart was killed when his Caudron C.360 (race no.11) crashed due to engine failure at Maisons near Chartres while he was training for the competition. The event was won by Georges Détré flying a Potez 53 powered by a Potez 9B radial engine developing barely 310 hp at full power at a speed of , beating Raymond Delmotte's Caudron C.362 (race no.6) with a speed of , and also beating the only foreign competitor, Nick Comper flying Comper Swift \"G-ABWW\" . A third French competitor, test pilot Lemoine also flying a Potez 53, was forced to abandon the race.\n\nOn 27 May 1934, the race was a duel between the Caudron pilots, the Caudron firm presenting two racing aircraft designed by Marcel Riffard. Maurice Arnoux won with a C.450 at a speed of 388.97 km/h overtaking Louis Massotte's Regnier-engined (and sponsored) C.366 (360.72 km/h) and Albert Monville's Renault-engined Caudron C.460 (341.04 km/h). Nick Comper flew the Comper Streak (G-ACNC), but retired on the 6th lap of the afternoon session as problem with the undercarriage limited his speed. Georges Detre flying a Potez 53-2 retired after problems with his engine oil supply. The Potez 53-3 had problems with its variable pitch propeller and was unable to start for the second section,\n\nThe 1935 race was arguably the most exciting competition of them all, and was the consecration of the Caudron-Renault racers. Eight pilots were registered for this event, but the Nennig C-3 (race no.4) of Guy Bart was not ready, and the Régnier Martinet, a modified Caudron C.366, (race no.2) was damaged during its tests. Two Caudron C.560s were supposed to participate (race no.1 and 3), but were not ready. They were thus replaced by a Caudron C.430 and a C.450 with the same race numbers.\n\nThe course was over 100 km (62 miles), from Etampes aerodrome to Chartres Bonce and back. The race itself was in two stages, each of 1,000 km (625 miles).\n\nCharles Franco was the first to take off in Caudron C.430 (race no.1), but abandoned the race on the fourth lap as he was clearly out-classed by the other aircraft. It was followed by the Caudron C.460s of Yves Lacombe (race no.5), Raymond Delmotte (Caudron's chief pilot) (race no.8 ), and Maurice Arnoux (race no.6) respectively, this last entrant having to quit the race after seven laps, having run out of oil after a high-speed lap at . Albert Monville's Caudron C.450 (race no.3) was the last to take off. Only three aircraft qualified for the second part of the race, which was held during rain showers. Raymond Delmotte won, ahead of Yves Lacombe and Maurice Arnoux, flying the aircraft previously flown by Albert Monville .\n\nOn 13 September 1936, a last competition was organized, in which two Caudron C.461s, one Caudron C.450 and two Caudron C.560s took part. Yves Lacombe won this race with a speed of only , overtaking Maurice Arnoux timed at , a performance barely superior to what had been established in 1934, probably because of bad engine tuning in a competition presenting no real challenge for the engine and aircraft manufacturers.\n\n"}
{"id": "54276421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54276421", "title": "Death Lineup", "text": "Death Lineup\n\nThe Death Lineup is a group of smaller basketball players on the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Developed under head coach Steve Kerr, it began during their 2014–15 run that led to an NBA championship. Unlike typical small-ball units, this Warriors lineup is versatile enough to defend larger opponents, while also aiming to create mismatches on offense with their shooting and playmaking skills.\n\nThe lineup features the Splash Brothers, a three-point shooting backcourt consisting of two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry, and perennial two-way All-Star Klay Thompson. It also features versatile defender Andre Iguodala on the wing alongside scorer Kevin Durant, and 2016–17 Defensive Player of the Year Draymond Green at center. Green's defensive versatility has been described as the \"key\" that allows the lineup to be so effective; although his natural position is power forward, he is able to play as an undersized center in lieu of a traditional center who might be slower or lack the playmaking and shooting abilities of Green. The lineup originally included Harrison Barnes, who was replaced by former league MVP Durant in 2016–17, when the group also began to be known as the \"Hamptons Five\".\n\nThe Death Lineup is considered to be indicative of a larger overall trend in the NBA towards \"positionless\" basketball, where traditional position assignments and roles have less importance.\n\nIn 2014–15, Golden State won 67 games in the regular season, led by NBA MVP Stephen Curry. The Warriors' starting lineup with the Andrew Bogut at center played 813 minutes together and outscored opponents by 19.6 points per 100 possessions. After falling behind 2–1 in the 2015 NBA Finals, Warriors coach Steve Kerr inserted Andre Iguodala into the starting unit for Bogut, who had been named to NBA All-Defensive Team in 2014. The change was first suggested by Kerr's special assistant, Nick U'Ren, who was a fan of the lineup because it always seemed to pick up the pace of the game to a faster speed, which the Warriors preferred. The five-man lineup of Iguodala, Curry, Thompson, Green, and Barnes had played together for 102 minutes during the regular season and 62 minutes through the first 18 games of the playoffs. Although the tallest player was only , the unit was also strong defensively. They were all able to switch on defense, spearheaded by Green's ability to guard players taller and heavier than him. The Warriors won 103–82 in Game 4, and captured the series 4–2 to win their first championship since 1975. Iguodala was named the Finals MVP, becoming the first player to garner the award without starting every game in the series, as well as the first winner to have not started a game during the regular season.\n\nIt took months after it was deployed in the Finals before the Warriors' small lineup was referred to as the Death Lineup. Despite the unit's success, the 2015–16 Warriors continued to start a traditional lineup with Bogut as their center. Golden State won an NBA-record 73 games behind Curry's league-leading 30.1 points per game and an NBA-record 402 three-pointers made in a season. He was named the MVP for the second straight season, becoming the first unanimous winner in league history. During the season, the Death Lineup was generally reserved to finish the first half and the end of games. It was deployed in 37 games, outscoring opponents by 166 points in 172 minutes for an average advantage of 4.5 points per game and 47.0 points per 100 possessions. Despite their regular season success, the Warriors lost the 2016 NBA Finals, becoming the first team to lose a Finals series after being ahead 3–1.\n\nDuring the off-season, Golden State signed former league MVP and four-time scoring champion Kevin Durant to replace Harrison Barnes, who had averaged just five points and made only 5 of 32 shots during the last three losses in the Finals. With Durant leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Warriors' opponents in the 2016 Western Conference Finals, the move was seen as a disruption in the competitive balance of the NBA, and the Warriors instantly became title favorites. The move gave the Death Lineup four players who have averaged at least five assists in a season. San Francisco Bay Area journalist Tim Kawakami coined the nickname \"Hamptons Five\" for the new group, which included the four players who traveled with team officials to The Hamptons to recruit Durant. The Warriors won the 2017 NBA Finals 4–1, and Durant was unanimously voted the Finals MVP. Kerr had used the Death Lineup for just 16 minutes in the series until deploying it for 17 in the Game 5 clincher. Iguodala scored 20 points in 38 minutes after averaging less than 30 minutes in the first four games of the series. Kerr used him in the small-ball lineup in favor of big men Zaza Pachulia (10 minutes) and JaVale McGee (0).\n\nInjuries limited Golden States' use of the Death Lineup in 2017–18. Opponents had also adapted by rarely leaving their centers in the game against the Warriors' small lineup. Through 49 games, the unit had a -1.2 plus-minus rating. However, it was still considered the team's most potent lineup. In the final 17 games of the regular season, the Warriors were 7–10 with Curry missing all but one game after an ankle and later a knee injury. Durant, Thompson, Green, and Iguodala each missed four to eight games as well. In Game 4 of the conference semifinals in the 2018 playoffs, Kerr started the Hamptons Five with Durant for the first time ever, and they posted a plus-minus of +26 in 18 minutes to lead a 118–92 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, giving Golden State a 3–1 lead in the series. After eliminating the Pelicans in five games, the Warriors continued with the starting lineup in the conference finals to build a 2–1 series lead against the Houston Rockets. Golden State won the series 4–3, but Iguodala missed the last four games with a bruised leg. The Warriors entered the NBA Finals for the fourth straight time versus their longterm rivals, the Cleveland Cavaliers. They swept the Cavaliers in four games, leading to their third championship in four years.\n\n"}

It was built in 1923, renovated to the former state in 1939, 1948 and 1954 and had a capacity of 30,000. Due to safety reasons this was reduced to 15,000 from 1994 onwards. It was used, mostly, for football matches of Rot-Weiss Essen and concerts. The stadium was demolished by August 2012.\n\nIn 1920, the predecessor of Rot-Weiss Essen bought a piece of land at the PHönixstrasse (which was later renamed to Hafenstrasse). After the purchase it appeared that the land was too short to build a stadium. In the years after, the club purchased the remaining lands and construction of the stadium began. In 1923 the club built three stands, which could hold 10,00 spectators. In 1939 the club built a new stadium on the same location, allowing the capacity to grow to roughly 27,000. During the Second World War the stadium was heavily damaged. In 1948 the renovation and reconstruction of it was finished and in the early 1950s Rot-Weiss Essen planned on building a new multifunctional main stand.\n\nThe ideas behind this new main stand would be a revolution on the European mainland. Georg Melches had a vision a multifunctional stand, in which a sporthall, a sauna, offices, residential units, commercial units and a press room were present. The construction would be made out of concrete and in 1954 the building was officially inaugurated. German and European papers were positive on these developments and even called the stadium the German Highbury, as an example to Arsenal’s former stadium. In 1952 Rot-Weiss Essen won the German Cup and in 1954 it won the German national championship. In 1956 Georg Melches and Rot-Weiss Essen installed the first floodlight installation of West Germany. The stadium was an example for other stadiums. Due to medical conditions, Georg Melches stepped down and died in 1963. In 1964 Rot-Weiss Essen renamed the stadium to the Georg Melches Stadion.\n\nAfter Melches’ death, Rot-Weiss Essen couldn’t have the same successes as in the 1950s. It also appeared that all the club’s money was invested in the stadium and the club had troubles in investing the little money left in new players. When West Germany was chosen as hosts for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, the club hoped investors and the municipality of Essen would invest into the stadium to make it a host for the World Cup. This didn’t happen and rivals Schalke 04 and Borussia Dortmund built a new stadium to host matches for the World Cup. With the little money left, Rot-Weiss Essen invested in renovating the stadium in 1975. Relegation from the 1. Bundesliga in 1977 and financial problems forced the club to sell the Georg Melches Stadium to Essen in 1979.\n\nThe municipality of Essen invested almost nothing in the renovation of the stadium and due to safety reasons parts of the stadium were closed down and demolished in 1994. The capacity was reduced to 15,000. In 2010 it was announced that Rot-Weiss Essen would build a new stadium 100 meters from the Georg Melches Stadion. One of the stands was cut into half, leaving the stadium with only 2.5 stands. On May 19, 2012, Rot-Weiss Essen played their last match in the stadium against Fortuna Köln. Two days later the Georg Melches Stadion was demolished and in August 2012 the Stadion Essen was opened.\n\n"}

The club brought the wooden seated stand from the previous ground, which remained the only spectator facility at Holiday Park during the club's spell in the Football League.

In 1937 a new 2,000 capacity stand was built as the ground was adapted for greyhound racing. This involved reducing the size of the pitch, and ultimately caused Durham City to fold in 1938. The ground was subsequently expanded as it continued to be used for greyhound racing. It was later demolished, with the site used by the electricity board.\n\nIndependent (unaffiliated to a governing body) greyhound racing took place at Holiday Park from 23 October 1937 with the ground undergoing improvements including a new 2,000 capacity stand.

The Modern school of chess espoused by Wilhelm Steinitz and Siegbert Tarrasch; the Hypermodernism influenced by Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti; and the Soviet Chess School promoted by Mikhail Botvinnik were all strongly influenced by Jewish players. Other influential Jewish chess theoreticians, writers and players include Zukertort, Tartakower, Lasker, Rubinstein, Breyer, Spielmann, Reshevsky, Fine, Bronstein, Najdorf, Tal, Fischer, and Polgár. Professor Arpad Elo, the inventor of the scientific rating system employed by the FIDE analysed some 476 major tournament players from the nineteenth century onward and of the fifty-one highest ranked players, approximately one-half were Jewish. One of the strongest ever players was the half Jewish Garry Kasparov, who was world No. 1 from 1985 until his retirement in 2005; however Kasparov has described himself as a \"self-appointed Christian\" preferring to follow his mother's faith. The strongest female chess player in history by far is the Jewish Judit Polgár. There is currently a strong Jewish presence among the world's best players. Currently, the world number two, Levon Aronian from Armenia, is half-Jewish. Beersheba in Israel is the city with the most chess grandmasters per capita in the world. Israel has also won one silver and one bronze medal at Chess Olympiads.\n\nThe topic of Jewish participation in chess is discussed extensively in academic and popular literature. One such book devoted to the topic is \"The Great Jewish Chess Champions\" by Harold U. Ribalow and Meir Z. Ribalow, Hippocrene Books, 1987, . Others include \"Chess, Jews, and history\", by Victor Keats, 1994, Oxford Academia Publishers, , \"Chess Among the Jews: A Translation and Explanation of the Work of Moritz Steinschneider\", by Victor Keats, 1995, , \"Chess in Jewish history and Hebrew literature\", by Victor Keats, 1995, Magnes Press, , and \"Can I Play Chess on Shabbas\", by Joe Bobker, 2008, . \"See also\" \"Jewish chess masters on stamps\", by Felix Berkovich and N. J. Divinsky, McFarland, 2000, . H.G. Wells, himself a chessplayer, discusses the eminence of the Jewish race in chess, in his History of the World. The Museum of Jewish Heritage is developing a special gallery relating to Jews in sports and chess, which will recognize \"major Jewish chess players such as Garry Kasparov, Mikhail Tal, and Judith Polgar\".\n\nThe list refers to chess players who are Jews and have attained outstanding achievements in chess.

Early in his life, Jimmie Lewallen struggles to dig himself out of a life of poverty. Choosing to attempt a living by bootlegging, he and his lifelong friend Bill Blair risk everything but through attempts to build a faster get-a-way vehicle for bootlegging, they inadvertently become a part of the birth of stock-car racing.

It is the home venue of SK Slavia Prague and occasionally the Czech Republic national football team. In the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons, it was also the venue of Bohemians 1905 home matches. During the 2011–12 season the stadium hosted home matches for FC Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League group stage.\n\nThe stadium was the venue for the 2013 UEFA Super Cup.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Slavia was forced to leave its stadium at Letná and a new stadium was built at Eden in the Vršovice district. Its capacity was about 50,000 (mostly for standing). The wooden western (main) stand was taken from the old stadium at Letná, the rest of the stands were made of concrete. The stadium also featured an athletics track. The first match at this stadium took place on 27 September 1953, Slavia drew 1-1 against the team of Křídla vlasti Olomouc. Josef Bican scored the home team's goal.\n\nIn the 1970s, it became apparent that Eden did not provide sufficient comfort for the visitors and started planning to build a new one in the same place. However, under the communist regime, the planning went quite slowly. Several projects were made, and the construction was finally to start in 1990. In 1989, Slavia moved temporarily to the nearby Ďolíček stadium (home of FC Bohemians Prague, now known as Bohemians 1905) and the eastern stand was torn down. However, the overthrowing of the communist regime in 1989 delayed the construction. In the meantime, Slavia moved to Stadion Evžena Rošického, a stadium on the Strahov hill, which is large but uncomfortable and poorly accessible.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the whole construction was cancelled and Slavia moved back to Eden. A temporary stand was built in the place of former eastern stand, but it was clear that Eden was outdated and Slavia needed a new home ground. Several more projects were made, but Slavia was unable to raise sufficient funds and there were some legal problems, as the premises were owned by the government and it took a lot of effort to transfer them to Slavia. In 2000, the stadium became ineligible to host Czech First League matches, so Slavia moved to the unpopular Strahov again.\n\nSlavia finally presented a project of the new stadium, but no construction started. In December 2003, the old Eden stadium was torn down and Slavia announced that the new stadium would be opened on 19 October 2005, however, by October 2005 the construction had not even started. It took another year to start. The project had to be scaled down to lower the construction cost from 1.8 billion Czech koruna to less than 1 billion. The construction eventually started in October 2006.\n\nDespite the stadium not being fully finished, it was opened on 7 May 2008 with an exhibition match against Oxford University A.F.C. Many former Slavia stars (such as Pavel Kuka, Patrik Berger, Jan Suchopárek and Ivo Knoflíček) took part in this match, which Slavia won 5–0.\n\nThe first competitive match at the new stadium was played on 17 May 2008 against Jablonec, the match ended 2–2, Slavia secured the Czech First League title in this final match of the 2007/08 season.\n\nIn 2016, CEFC China Energy, who had previously purchased a majority stake in SK Slavia Prague, sought to buy a 70% stake in the stadium and announced plans to invest around €50 million (including the purchase price) to improve the stadium capacity and turn it into the main national stadium for the Czech Republic national team. In April 2017, it was announced that the details of the transaction have since changed and CEFC China Energy had purchased the stadium in full.\n\nIn July 2008, it was announced that betting company Synot Tip had made an agreement with E Side Property Limited, the owners of the stadium, regarding a sponsorship deal regarding one of the stands. In 2009, the stadium's name was officially changed to Synot Tip Arena.\n\nIn 2011, Natland Group were announced as the new majority owners of the stadium.\n\nIn 2012 it was announced that Synot would not be extending their sponsorship of the stadium past the end of the 2011–12 season.\n\nEden Arena has hosted three competitive matches and two friendly matches of the Czech Republic national football team.\n\nThe stadium is occasionally used for other events beside football, such as concerts or other sports matches. In 2012, the Sokol \"slet\", a mass gymnastics event, was held here.\n\nThe stadium was used for the final rugby matches of the 2008 and 2009–10 KB Extraliga seasons.\n\nThere is a hotel and a fan shop in the northern stand, and various other facilities (bar, McDonald's, Komerční banka branch, offices) in the main stand.\n\nThe stadium is served by buses and trams, with stops for both using the name \"Slavia\". Trams 4, 7, 22 and 24 run along \"Vršovická\" street, north of the stadium, while bus services 135, 136, 150 and 213 stop on \"U Slavie\" street, immediately west of the stadium. The nearest metro station is Želivského.\n\n"}

{"id": "54936152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54936152", "title": "The Athletic", "text": "The Athletic\n\nThe Athletic is a subscription-based sports website covering professional and college teams in Chicago, Toronto, and more than 30 other North American cities. The site also covers national stories in football, basketball, baseball, hockey, and soccer through a mix of long-form journalism, original reporting, and podcasts. Their business model is predicated on dis-aggregating the sports section of local newspapers and reaching non-local fans that are not reached by a local newspaper.\n\n\"The Athletic\" was founded by Alex Mather and Adam Hansmann, former coworkers at subscription-based fitness company Strava, with the mission of producing \"smarter coverage for die-hard fans.\" The company was built as an alternative to the struggling ad-supported models. \"The Athletic\" relies on subscription revenue, not advertising revenue, to support the business.\n\nAs part of Y Combinator's Summer 2016 batch, the site originally launched in Chicago in January 2016, with Jon Greenberg serving as the founding editor, along with Sahadev Sharma (Cubs) and Scott Powers (Blackhawks). Greenberg and Powers previously worked at ESPN Chicago, while Sharma left \"Baseball Prospectus\"' Cubs vertical to join the website. \n\nIn October 2016, \"The Athletic\" expanded to a second city, Toronto, to focus on Maple Leafs, Raptors, and Blue Jays coverage. \"The Athletic\" hired James Mirtle as editor-in-chief for Toronto. Mirtle spent over a decade as a sportswriter at \"The Globe and Mail\" before joining \"The Athletic\". A third city, Cleveland, launched in March 2017, with Jason Lloyd as editor-in-chief. \"The Athletic\" continued city expansion to Detroit in June 2017. In August, the site hired Ken Rosenthal as a senior baseball writer, shortly after Fox Sports eliminated its entire writing staff.\n\nThe first major funding was provided by Courtside Ventures, which provided $2.3 million in seed funding. In July 2017, the company raised another $5.8 million in funding and announced their expansion into the Philadelphia and San Francisco-area sports markets. \"The Athletic\" expanded into Minnesota and the rest of Canada in September 2017. In February 2018, \"The Athletic\" announced further expansion into three new cities—New York, Dallas, and Cincinnati—and launched baseball-only coverage in Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego, Arizona, and Kansas City.\n\nIn March 2018, the company announced a $20 million third round of funding led by Evolution Media. Mather reported that this money would be invested into expanding coverage to new cities and increasing the number of writers from the then staff of 120. That same month, the site announced full coverage in Denver and Boston starting in April. In Denver, \"The Athletic\" hired several reporters from \"The Denver Post\". In Boston, the initial staff consisted of beat writers previously employed at the \"Boston Globe\", \"Boston Herald\" and the \"Springfield Republican\"'s web portal MassLive. Adding to college football coverage, \"The Athletic\" added dedicated beat writers for major programs like Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee. In May, the site announced coverage of both domestic and international soccer. In June 2018, \"The Athletic\" increased coverage in Los Angeles and expanded into Buffalo, New York by hiring several reporters who had been bought out from \"The Buffalo News\" the same month.\n"}

The facility also incorporates a workout/ wellness center, martial arts center, and racquetball courts. \n\nConsidered a very fast pool it has been the site of many national and international swimming competitions. Numerous world and American records have been set over the years at the facility by Pablo Morales, Janet Evans, Matt Biondi, Tom Jager, Dara Torres and others.\n\nFormerly known as the Justus Aquatic Center it opened January 1985 as a business venture combining a hotel with a sporting venue. It was the first aquatic, fitness and hotel complex, of its kind. Financial problems plagued the center from the beginning. In 1988, there was a brief closure of the facility as it was taken in receivership by the Great Western Bank. The facility was renamed the Orlando International Aquatic and Fitness Center. Citing an operating loss of $600,000 a year and the impossibility of running an aquatics facility of that size in the black, the bank closed the center in January 1992. The center was to be destroyed in order to make a larger parking lot.\n\nA local hotelier, Harris Rosen, fought the closure, by forming an organization called Friends of the Aquatic Center with several aquatics activists such as Dr. Lucky Meisenheimer, Scott Henderson, Julie Sundstrom and others. A six-month community battle ensued in the attempt to reopen the center. Rallies and protest marches were held and congressional representatives Jim Bacchus and Bill McCollum became involved.\n\nUltimately a deal between the county commission and the bank was arranged, in exchange for zoning changes that increased hotel room density at the site, the bank separated the Aquatic Center from the hotel and donated the facility to the county. Not wanting to manage the facility, the county offered the center to the Central Florida YMCA. Jerry Haralson the CEO of the Central Florida YMCAs agreed to add the Aquatic Center to the Central Florida YMCA community. \n\nIn June 1992, the facility reopened as the YMCA Aquatic Center.\n\nCharlie Stuart became the first chairman of the YMCA Aquatic Center’s Board of Directors and Richard Robinson was named the first executive Director. \n\nIn 1994 Jim Ferber the CEO of the Central Florida YMCA arranged a partnership with Florida Hospital Orlando that resulted in the addition of a physical therapy and rehabilitation center to the YMCA Aquatic Center. The remodeling project was completed under the guidance of Jim Purdy the then executive director of the YMCA Aquatic Center. \n\nIn the mid 1990s, John Vasbinder took over as the executive director of the YMCA Aquatic Center and for the first time the center began to run in the black. A $250,000 grant from Orange County resulted in further improvements to the center. \n\nIn 2007 the YMCA Aquatic Center added a new $150,000 video scoreboard under the guidance of Steve Corrie, executive Director of the YMCA Aquatic Center from 2007-2012. In 2010 Corrie led a successful $1.3million capital campaign that provided a comprehensive facelift for the facility. These upgrades allowed the Aquatic Center to move back into the national swim meet scene. During his tenure, Corrie rebranded the facility in the swimming world as 'The Big House'. The name has stuck since then. \n\nThe YMCA Aquatic Center currently houses a number of competitive athletic teams in swimming, water polo, and diving. One of those programs is YCF Diving who, in 2012, had 2 Olympic Trials qualifiers (Justin Dumais & Wallace Layland) and 1 Olympian (Brittany Viola).. The YCF Water Polo program was named the 2012 Southeast Club of the year. Special Olympic/Dr P Phillips High School Coach and YMCA volunteer, Apryle Nickson was named the 2012 North America Special Olympic Coach of the Year.\n\n"}
