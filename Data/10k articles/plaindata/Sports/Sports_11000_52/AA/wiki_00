The system is designed to be both predictive and retrodictive in nature, although in practice it has proven to be more strongly predictive than retrodictive.\n\nThe ARGH Power Ratings evaluate teams taking into account a team's wins and losses, its points scored both for and against, its schedule, and the location of the team's games. It is unusual in that for the purposes of providing meaningful ratings throughout the season it seeds teams based on several stated criteria, including records from the previous two seasons, the previous year's strength of schedule, the number of returning starters, whether the head coach is returning, whether the starting quarterback is returning, and published recruiting rankings from several preseason publications. Preseason seedings disappear over the course of the season, and are completely absent from consideration by the time the season ends.\n\nThis system is also sometimes used for NCAA basketball, but due to the relative lack of available preseason information, ARGH basketball power ratings are strictly retrodictive in nature. \n\n"}

{"id": "47642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47642", "title": "Castling", "text": "Castling\n\nCastling is a move in the game of chess involving a player's king and either of the player's original rooks. It is the only move in chess in which a player moves two pieces in the same move, and it is the only move aside from the knight's move where a piece can be said to \"jump over\" another.\n\nCastling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook on the player's first , then moving the rook to the square over which the king crossed. Castling may only be done if the king has never moved, the rook involved has never moved, the squares between the king and the rook involved are unoccupied, the king is not in check, and the king does not cross over or end on a square in which it would be in check. Castling is one of the rules of chess and is technically a king move .\n\nThe notation for castling, in both the descriptive and the algebraic systems, is 0-0 with the rook and 0-0-0 with the rook; in PGN, O-O and O-O-O are used instead. Castling on the kingside is sometimes called \"castling short\" and castling on the queenside is called \"castling long\" – the difference based on whether the rook moves a short distance (two squares) or a long distance (three squares) .\n\nCastling was added to European chess in the 14th or 15th century and did not develop into its present form until the 17th century. The Asian versions of chess do not have such a move.\n\nCastling is permissible provided all of the following conditions hold :\n\nConditions 4 through 6 can be summarized with the more memorable phrase: \"One may not castle out of, through, or into check.\"\n\nIt is a common misperception that the requirements for castling are even more stringent than the above. To clarify:\n\n\nIn handicap games where odds of a rook are given, the player giving odds may still castle with the absent rook, moving only the king.\n\nCastling is an important goal in the opening, because it serves two valuable purposes: it moves the king into a safer position away from the center of the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position in the center of the board (it is even possible to checkmate with castling).\n\nThe choice as to which side to castle often hinges on an assessment of the trade-off between king safety and activity of the rook. Kingside castling is generally slightly safer, because the king ends up closer to the edge of the board and all the pawns on the castled side are defended by the king. In queenside castling, the king is placed closer to the center and the pawn on the a- is undefended; the king is thus often moved to the b-file to defend the a-pawn and to move the king away from the center of the board. In addition, queenside castling requires moving the queen; therefore, it may take slightly longer to achieve than kingside castling. On the other hand, queenside castling places the rook more efficiently – on the central d-file. It is often immediately active, whereas with kingside castling a tempo may be required to move the rook to a more efficient square.\n\nIt is common for both players to castle kingside, and rare for both players to castle queenside. If one player castles kingside and the other queenside, it is called \"opposite\" (or \"opposite-side\") \"castling\". Castling on opposite sides usually results in a fierce fight as both players' pawns are free to advance to attack the opposing king's castled position without exposing the player's own castled king. An example is the Yugoslav Attack, in the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defence.\n\nIf the king is forced to move before it has the opportunity to castle, the player may still wish to maneuver the king towards the edge of the board and the corresponding rook towards the center. When a player takes three or four moves to accomplish what castling would have accomplished in one move, it is sometimes called \"artificial castling\", or \"castling by hand\".\n\nUnder the strict touch-move rules enforced in most tournaments, castling is considered a king move. However, under current US Chess Federation rules, a player who intends to castle and touches the rook first would suffer no penalty, and would be permitted to perform castling, provided castling is legal in the position. Still, the correct way to castle is to first move the king. As usual, the player's mind may change between all legal destination squares for the king until it is released. When the two-square king move is completed, however, the player has formally chosen to castle (if it is legal), and the rook must be moved accordingly. A player who performs a forbidden castling must return the king and the rook to their original places and then move the king, if there is another legal king move, including castling on the other side. If there is no legal king move, the touch-move rule does \"not\" apply to the rook .\n\nIt is also required by the official rules that the entire move be completed using only a single hand. Neither of these rules is commonly enforced in casual play, nor commonly known by non-competitive players .\n\nThe right to castle must be the same in all three positions for a valid draw claim under the threefold repetition rule.\n\nSome chess variants, for example Chess960, have modified castling rules to handle modified starting positions. Castling can also be adapted to large chess variants, like Capablanca Chess, which is played on a 10×8 board. In shogi, the term \"castle\" refers to a different concept of building a multi-piece defensive structure that defends the king.\n\nIn chess problems, castling is assumed to be allowed if it appears possible, unless it can be proved by retrograde analysis that either the king or chosen rook has previously moved.\n\n\nIn this game, Yuri Averbakh–Cecil Purdy (1960), Black castled queenside. Averbakh pointed out that the rook passed over a square controlled by White and thought it was illegal. Purdy proved that the castling was legal since this applies only to the king, to which Averbakh replied \"Only the king? Not the rook?\" , .\n\nIn this game, Edward Lasker–Sir George Thomas (London 1912), Black had just played 17...Kg1. White might have checkmated by 18.0-0-0 but instead played 18.Kd2#. (See Edward Lasker's notable games.)\n\nThis game, Lodewijk Prins–Lawrence Day (1968), had ended earlier on move 28, but if Prins had played on he would have been unable to avoid this position. Black now checkmates by castling: 31...0-0-0. (See Lawrence Day's notable chess games.)\n\nIn the game Feuer–O'Kelly, Belgian Championship 1934, Feuer perpetrated what later became known as a famous opening trap against O'Kelly when he castled queenside with check, simultaneously attacking and winning O'Kelly's rook on b2, which had captured Feuer's pawn on that square.\nCastling has its roots in the \"king's leap\". There were two forms of the leap: (1) the king would move once like a knight, and (2) the king would move two squares on his first move. The knight-move might be used early in the game to get the king to safety or later in the game to escape a threat. This second form was played in Europe as early as the 13th century. In North Africa, the king was moved to a safe square by a two-step procedure: (1) the king moved to the second and (2) the rook moved to the king's original square and the king moved to the rook's original square .\n\nBefore the bishop and queen acquired their current moves in the 16th century they were weak pieces and the king was relatively safe in the middle of the board. When the bishop and queen got their current moves they became very powerful and the king was no longer safe on its original square, since it can be attacked from a distance and from both sides. Castling was added to allow the king to get to a safer location and to allow rooks to get into the game earlier .\n\nThe rule of castling has varied by location and time. In medieval England, Spain, and France, the white king was allowed to jump to c1, c2, d3, e3, f3, or g1, if no capture was made, the king was not in check, and did not move over check. (The black king might move similarly.) In Lombardy, the white king might jump an additional square to b1 or h1 or to a2 (and equivalent squares for the black king). Later in Germany and Italy, the king move was combined with a pawn move.\n\nIn Rome from the early 17th century until the late 19th century, the rook might be placed on any square up to and including the king's square, and the king might be moved to any square on the other side of the rook. This was called \"free castling\".\n\nIn the Göttingen manuscript (c. 1500) and a game published by Luis Ramírez de Lucena in 1498, castling consisted of two moves: first the rook and then the king.\n\nThe current version of castling was established in France in 1620 and England in 1640 .\n\nIn the 1811 edition of his chess treatise, Johann Allgaier introduced the 0-0 notation. He differentiated between \"0-0r\" (r=right) and \"0-0l\" (l=left). The 0-0-0 notation for queenside castling was added in 1837 by Aaron Alexandre. The practice was then accepted in the first edition (1843) of the \"Handbuch des Schachspiels\".\n\nIn most European languages, castling is known by a derivative from the same root as the English word \"rook\" (e.g. \"rochieren, rochada, enroque\"), while the local adjectives meaning \"long\" and \"short\" (or \"big\" and \"small\") are used in those countries to refer to queenside and kingside castling, respectively.\n\n\n\n"}

The stadium is home to the Central Coast Mariners association football club which compete in the A-League. The stadium also hosts rugby league and rugby union fixtures on an ad hoc basis as well as other major social events.\n\nThe stadium was originally designed to be the home stadium for the North Sydney Bears rugby league football club.\n\nThe stadium is rectangular and is unusual in that seating is located on only three sides of the ground. The southern end is open giving filtered views of Brisbane Water through a row of palm trees. With an all seater capacity of 20,059 it was the second smallest stadium in the A-League. It is within walking distance of the Gosford CBD and Gosford railway station. The Central Coast Leagues Club and League Club Field are adjacent to the stadium, across Dane Drive.\n\nIn 1911, Erina Shire Council proposed to create a park on the shore of Brisbane Water. The park required much land to be reclaimed from marshland. It also required privately owned land to be purchased by council and a section of road to be demolished. \"Waterside Park\" was opened in 1915 and a cricket pitch was added during that year. Further reclamation of the foreshore extended the park during the Depression that gave work to the unemployed. By 1939 surplus railway land had been added and a Bowling Club and green as well as tennis courts had been constructed. In 1939 the Park was renamed Grahame Park, after the then mayor of Gosford, William Calman Grahame.\n\nA full stadium was then touted and later built in the late 1990s, planned to be ready in 1999 for NRL club the North Sydney Bears, before construction problems including large spells of inclement weather delayed completion. The stadium finally opened in early 2000 as NorthPower Stadium at Grahame Park, the Northern Eagles National Rugby League team (a merging of the aforementioned Bears and the Manly Sea Eagles) taking residence there until their dissolving at the conclusion of the 2002 season.\n\nIn 2003, with no major sporting team in residence, the stadium played host to three group matches in the 2003 Rugby World Cup. The Pacific Islanders rugby union team played one match at the stadium on their 2004 tour.\n\nThe stadium gained its second full-time tenant in 2005 with the formation of the Central Coast Mariners, a team in the newly formed national A-League football competition. It became the first full-time national sporting competition to have a team play at the stadium. Further use of the stadium in 2006 follows from it being the home ground to the Central Coast Waves rugby union team, which joined the Shute Shield in 2006.\n\nThe stadium continues to host NRL competition matches from time to time, as well as a number of pre-season trials. The Central Coast Rays, the Central Coasts' Australian Rugby Championship team, played out of the stadium during the only season of the competition in 2007. The stadium continued as a home to the Mariners A-League side , and hosted NRL matches throughout the 2008 Centenary Year. In 2014, the NSW Country Eagles hosted a National Rugby Championship match at Central Coast.\n\nIn recent years the Sydney Roosters have hosted one NRL game per season at Central Coast Stadium; other clubs such as the South Sydney Rabbitohs, Wests Tigers, Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs have also taken games to the Central Coast. In 2004, Central Coast Stadium played host to two North Queensland Cowboys matches, the first of which resulted in a historic 20-20 draw with wooden spooners South Sydney, the first such result since golden point was introduced in 2003.\n\nThere has been several name changes since the Stadium was built, primarily reactions relating to sponsorship: \n\nGosford railway station is nearby. The station is served by the Central Coast & Newcastle Line and a small number of long-distance services.\n\nRecord crowds for different sports:\nThe stadium has hosted one rugby league international.\n\nThe stadium hosted three games of the 2003 Rugby World Cup which was held in Australia.\n\n"}

A list of WADA-banned substances is regularly published to the public and amended as scientific knowledge expands. The IAAF and anti-doping bodies undertake in-competition sampling of athletes blood and urine in order to detect where athletes have taken banned substances. This is also complemented by out-of-competition tests during the tournament and in the preceding period.\n\nWhere a banned substance is detected in-competition the athlete's performance will be annulled and—depending on the severity of the infraction—the athlete may be banned from the sport for a set period. Where an out-of-competition sample tests positive for a banned substance, any performances by the athlete after that date may also be annulled. Athletes may also be banned via doping regulations if the athlete fails to submit to testing, tampers or interferes with the undertaking of anti-doping procedures, or is found in possession of banned substances. Where a performance is annulled, any medals won by the athlete will be stripped from the athlete and the IAAF may decided to reallocate the medal(s) to the next best performers. This includes disqualification of whole national relay teams should one member break anti-doping rules. Samples are stored for future retesting, as improved methods over time may lead to previously unidentified cases of doping. The IAAF began a long-term storage approach from the 2007 World Championships onwards.\n\nA total of 162 athletes (69 men and 93 women) have had their results annulled at the World Championships, and 40 of these have been stripped of medals as a result. A total of 53 medals have been stripped as a result of doping infractions. The first doping failure pre-dates the main championships and comes from Spanish hurdler Rosa Colorado at the 1980 World Championships in Athletics – an event which only featured two women's events not on the Olympic programme. World champions to be banned include North American sprinters Ben Johnson, Marion Jones, Tim Montgomery and Kelli White. Other prominent champions to have been banned include Russian middle-distance runner Mariya Savinova, steeplechaser Yuliya Zaripova and racewalker Olga Kaniskina. The majority of stripped medallists have come from the United States and the post-Soviet states, though athletes from many other nations of the world have failed doping tests at the competition.\n\nThere has been an upward trend in the number of doping violations at the championships, with a peak of 50 athletes having had their performances annulled at the 2011 event, though it is assumed that this reflects improved detection rather than increased overall doping – an anonymous survey at that championships revealed over 30% of athletes had used banned substances during their career.\n\nGiven the susceptibility of the sport of athletics to doping issues, the IAAF has been central in the development of anti-doping standards and anti-doping measures have been were present at World Championships since the first edition in 1983. The anti-doping approach had a new development at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics, where all Russian athletes were banned due to state-sponsored doping and had to request dispensation to compete at Authorised Neutral Athletes.\n\nThis table collates the total number of athletes who have been disqualified for doping at the championships by nation.

{"id": "12711043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12711043", "title": "Flea Kicker", "text": "Flea Kicker\n\nIn college football, the Flea Kicker was a notable play executed by the Nebraska Cornhuskers against the Missouri Tigers on November 8, 1997 that sent the game into overtime and resulted in a win for the Cornhuskers who went on to share the NCAA Division I-A National Championship with the Michigan Wolverines. The final minutes of the game were seen by many people on ABC, after other regional games ended.\n\nThe Cornhuskers, who had won national championships for the 1994 and 1995 seasons, went into the game with an 8–0 record and a No. 1 ranking in the AP Poll. They had only given up seven points in their last three games and had beaten the Tigers eighteen straight times. The Tigers were unranked with a 6–3 record, and in the school’s history, had never beaten a No. 1 ranked team.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Tigers quarterback Corby Jones completed a pass to Eddie Brooks to give Missouri a 38–31 lead, giving Missouri fans hope that they would beat Nebraska for the first time since 1978 and moving coach Larry Smith to tears. The Huskers took possession from a punt after Missouri failed to convert a first down on their own 33-yard line with 1:02 left. In less than a minute, the Huskers moved the ball 55 yards. The Huskers were on the Missouri 12-yard line with only seven seconds left when Nebraska quarterback Scott Frost threw a pass intended for wingback Shevin Wiggins. The ball hit Wiggins directly in the chest near the goal line. The ball immediately shot down and hit a Missouri safety in the foot and popped back in the air. Then Missouri safety Julian Jones tackled Wiggins as time expired. As Wiggins was pulled to the ground, his leg popped up, kicking the ball into the air for a second time. Cornhuskers receiver Matt Davison leaped for the ball, his hands scraping the turf as he managed to make the catch in the endzone for a touchdown. Missouri fans stormed the field in celebration, thinking they had won.\n\nThe play could have resulted in a 15-yard penalty (illegal kick) if officials had considered the kick intentional. Instead, they ruled the catch a touchdown. Once fans were cleared from the field, Kris Brown kicked the extra point for Nebraska to send the game into overtime. In OT, Frost ran for a touchdown, and Jones was sacked on 4th and seven by Grant Wistrom to give Nebraska a 45–38 win.\n\nMissouri finished the season 7–5 with a loss to Colorado State in the Holiday Bowl. The Tigers did not defeat the Cornhuskers until 2003, ending a 24-game losing streak in the series.\n\nAfter the game, Wiggins claimed to have kicked the ball intentionally to keep the play alive, and some of his statements indicate that he did so to keep the ball away from Missouri defenders. He also at various times and in later interviews claimed to have been trying to kick the ball back to himself for a catch. Regardless, the outcome of the game could not be changed after the fact, despite the kick leading to Nebraska's win. The legality of the play remains in dispute among college football fans and experts, as NCAA rules at the time generally made it illegal for an intentional kick (by players other than kickers and punters) but also allowed players to use any part of their bodies - including feet - to help themselves catch a forward pass. Furthermore, the rules only allowed officials to establish intent to kick only as they could determine clearly on the field of play.\n\nAlthough Nebraska dropped to No. 3 in the AP Poll the following week, they were still undefeated, and national title hopes were still alive. The Cornhuskers defeated Iowa State and Colorado in the last two games of the regular season and beat Texas A&M 54–15 in the Big 12 Championship Game.

{"id": "1042845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1042845", "title": "Flip jump", "text": "Flip jump\n\nThe flip jump (usually just flip) is a figure skating jump which takes off from a backward inside edge with a toe pick assist, and lands on the backward outside edge of the opposite foot. In the early 20th century, the jump was known as a Mapes. In international competition, women have landed flips with three rotations since 1981, and men have landed flips with four rotations since 2016.\n\nA flip is a figure skating jump which takes off from a backward inside edge with a toe pick assist, and lands on the backward outside edge of the opposite foot. The name is generally modified by number of rotations performed while the skater is airborne (e.g., a triple flip for three rotations).\n\nThe origins of the flip jump are obscure. Starting in 1913, the jump was known for many years as a Mapes (now applied to the toe loop in the jargon of artistic roller skating), but it is not known for certain if Bruce Mapes was the inventor. It was certainly being commonly performed by the 1930s.\n\nIt is also not definitely established who performed the first triple flip; David Jenkins may have landed the jump in the 1950s, but perhaps only in practice. Donald Jackson is said to have performed one at the 1961 North American Figure Skating Championships. Another source claims that no skater had yet landed one in competition as late as 1968, when John Misha Petkevich was performing them in practice.\n\nKatarina Witt was one of two female skaters to land a triple flip for the first time at the 1981 European Championships.\n\nDaisuke Takahashi made an attempt at a quad flip at the 2010 World Championships. Shoma Uno became the first skater to ever land a quadruple flip at the 2016 Team Challenge Cup\n\nThe most common entry into a flip, for a counterclockwise jump, is a long forward straight-line glide on the left foot down the center of the rink with the (right) free foot held forward. The skater uses the toe of the right foot to push into a left forward outside 3 turn, reaching back to pick with the right foot to vault into the jump from the left back inside edge immediately after the turn. The skater performs one or more rotations in the air before landing on a right back outside edge.\n\nThe flip can also be entered from a mohawk turn, and lends itself well to being performed out of a more complicated footwork approach.\n\nIn British English, the flip is sometimes called a \"toe salchow\", but in fact it is a mistake to think of the jump as a toe pick-assisted salchow because the technique and mechanics of the two jumps are very different. The flip is actually quite similar in mechanics to the loop jump; in both jumps, the rotation comes from the right side of the body (for counterclockwise rotation), and the left leg is already crossed in front of the right in what is called a \"back spin position\" when the skater springs into the air.\n\nThe flip is also similar to the Lutz jump, a toe-assisted jump which takes off a back outside rather than back inside edge. In the same way that some skaters \"flutz\", or turn an intended Lutz jump into a flip by mistakenly changing to the wrong edge on the takeoff, some skaters have a tendency to \"lip\" their flips by mistakenly changing to an outside edge so that it is actually a Lutz jump. Some skaters never manage to get on a strong edge for either the flip or Lutz, a habit that is probably reinforced by the trend to enter both of these jumps from a straight line rather than on a curve. Skating experts tend to be critical of wrong-edge takeoffs, although judges have dealt inconsistently with edge errors over the years. During the 2007 Grand Prix series, however, the technical judges began penalizing wrong-edge takeoffs on all skaters. Since then, penalties have become more severe; beginning in 2015, the ISU implemented a 30% reduction in base value for flip and Lutz jumps with incorrect take-off edges. Today, the detection and penalization of wrong-edge takeoffs on flip and Lutz jumps remains a controversial topic, due mostly to the unclear range of acceptable edge degrees for respective jumps, as well as the seemingly selective use of the penalty on the part of the judges.\n\nAnother notable technique flaw that appears in many skaters' flips (and Lutz jumps) is \"mule kick\" or \"toe hammering,\" which occurs when the free leg rises unusually high, typically near (in some cases above) hip height, before descending to strike the ice. This can make the jump easier to rotate but sacrifices height and some control.\n\nA half-rotation jump with a flip entrance, typically landed on the left toe pick and right forward inside edge for a counterclockwise jump, is called a \"half flip\". The half flip, in turn, forms the basis for the common split jump, in which the skater achieves either a front-to-back or sideways (Russian or straddle) split position at the apex of the jump. A full-rotation flip jump with a split position is sometimes seen as well; this is called a \"split flip\".\nIn the past, it was also quite common for skaters to perform a \"one-and-a-half flip\" jump as an element in jump sequences or as a highlight in step sequences.\n\nIn general, the International Skating Union's new \"code of points\" judging system now discourages skaters from putting variety jumps such as the split flip or one-and-a-half flip into their competitive programs because they count towards the number of permitted jumps but carry a very low point value.\n"}

But the large number of competitors makes it impossible to fit all of them at the same starting line. So the athletes stand in a pack before they begin: some are behind others, sometimes by dozens of meters or more, depending on the number of competitors.\n\nThe tradition is that all the athletes start at the same time, the gun time, and use the same starting line and same finishing line as those in the front of the pack. This means that those in the back of the pack have to run an extra distance. One's position in the pack at starting is determined either based on their previous records, or chosen by the participant based on their own expectation and etiquette. Usually, the best athletes take the front positions.\n\nModern electronic technology has made it possible to get the time lapsed for each individual athlete from their crossing the starting line to their crossing the finishing line, the chip time. This is also called transponder timing. However, this has the disadvantage that the race finish is not simultaneous, so the race results do not match the finish line order. Other ways to avoid disadvantage towards those in the back of the pack are individual starts (where athletes start one at a time) and interval starts (where athletes are released in small batches). Chip time is normally not used to determine top positions. The first to reach the finish shall be the winner.\n\nIn cross country skiing, on elite level, the tradition is individual start. Each athlete starts at their own predetermined time. Mass starts are used more often after 1990, partly because of TV influence. It creates better summaries for TV stations that do not want to show the entire race, and for viewers who do not want to see all.\n\n"}
{"id": "18259331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18259331", "title": "Merkle's Boner", "text": "Merkle's Boner\n\nMerkle's Boner refers to the notorious base-running mistake committed by rookie Fred Merkle of the New York Giants in a game against the Chicago Cubs on September 23, 1908. Merkle's failure to advance to second base on what should have been a game-winning hit led instead to a forceout at second and a tied game. The Cubs later won the makeup game, which proved decisive as they beat the Giants by one game to win the National League (NL) pennant for 1908. It has been described as \"the most controversial game in baseball history\".\nThe NL pennant race of 1908 was a three-team fight among the teams that dominated the league in the first decade of the modern era: the Pittsburgh (then often spelled Pittsburg) Pirates (pennant winners in 1901, 1902, and 1903), the Giants (winners in 1904 and 1905), and the Cubs (winners in 1906 and 1907). The teams were clustered in the standings all year, with Pittsburgh never more than 2.5 games up or 5 back, the Giants never more than 4.5 up or 6.5 back, and the Cubs never more than 4 games up or 6 games back. When play began at the Polo Grounds in New York City on September 23, 1908, the Cubs and Giants were tied for first place (although the Giants had six more games to play, with an 87–50 record as opposed to the Cubs' 90–53), and the Pirates were 1.5 games back with an 88–54 record.\n\nMerkle was 19 years old in 1908, the youngest player in the National League. He played in only 38 games all year, 11 of which were at first base as the backup for regular Giants first baseman Fred Tenney. Merkle was recovering from two foot surgeries in July following a blood infection that nearly caused his foot to be amputated and was unable to play for most of July and August. On the morning of September 23, Tenney woke up with a case of lumbago, and Giants manager John McGraw penciled Merkle in at first base. It was the first big-league game Merkle had ever started.\n\nFuture Hall-of-Famer Christy Mathewson started for the Giants; Jack Pfiester started for the Cubs. As was customary at the time, the game had only two umpires: Bob Emslie on the basepaths and Hank O'Day behind the plate.\n\nThe Giants were the home team. Neither Mathewson nor Pfiester allowed a run through three innings. In the fourth, Cubs shortstop Joe Tinker hit the ball into the outfield, and when right fielder Mike Donlin could not stop it from going past him deep into the cavernous outfield of the Polo Grounds, Tinker circled the bases for an inside-the-park home run that gave Chicago a 1–0 lead. It was the first homer hit off Mathewson since a homer by Tinker on July 17. The Giants tied the score in the fifth when Buck Herzog singled, advanced to second on an error, advanced to third on a sacrifice by Roger Bresnahan, and scored on a single by Donlin. The game was still tied 1–1 when the Giants came to bat in the bottom of the ninth.\n\nPfiester remained on the mound for Chicago. Cy Seymour led off with a groundout to second. Art Devlin singled, putting the winning run on first base with one out. Moose McCormick grounded sharply to second, but Devlin's aggressive slide prevented a double play and allowed McCormick to reach first base safely on a fielder's choice. With two outs and McCormick on first, Fred Merkle came up to bat. Merkle, who only had 47 plate appearances in the entire 1908 season, singled down the right-field line. McCormick, the potential winning run, advanced to third base.\nShortstop Al Bridwell came up to bat next with two outs and runners at the corners. Bridwell swung at the first pitch from Pfiester, a fastball, and drilled an apparent single into center field. McCormick ran home from third, and the game appeared to be over, a 2–1 Giants victory. Giants fans poured out of the stands and mobbed the field; fans sitting behind home plate customarily crossed the field to exit the ballpark via the outfield in this era. Merkle, advancing from first base, saw the fans swarming onto the playing field. He turned back to the dugout without ever touching second. Official rule 4.09 states that \"A run is not scored if the runner advances to home base during a play in which the third out is made ... by any runner being forced out\".\n\nCubs second baseman Johnny Evers saw an opportunity to have the rule enforced. He shouted to center fielder Solly Hofman, who, though the field was filled with fans, retrieved the ball and threw it to Evers. According to one account, Joe McGinnity, a Giants pitcher who was coaching first base that day, intercepted the ball and threw it away into the crowd of fans. Evers apparently retrieved the ball and touched second base, although some reports stated that he substituted a different ball. Umpires Emslie and O'Day hurriedly consulted and O'Day, who saw the play from home plate, ruled that Merkle had not touched second base, and on that basis Emslie ruled him out on a force, and O'Day ruled that the run did not score.\n\nNewspapers told different stories of who had gotten the ball to Evers and how. Christy Mathewson, however, who was coaching first base for the Giants, acknowledged in an affidavit that Merkle never made it to second. One newspaper claimed that Cub players physically restrained Merkle from advancing to second. Retelling the story in 1944, Evers insisted that after McGinnity (who was not playing in the game) had thrown the ball away, Cubs pitcher Rube Kroh (who also was not in the game) retrieved it from a fan and threw it to shortstop Tinker, who threw it to Evers. (By rule, after a fan or a player who was not in the game touched the ball, it should have been ruled dead.) A contemporary account from the \"Chicago Tribune\" supports this version. However, eight years prior to that, Evers claimed to have gotten the ball directly from Hofman. Five years after the play, Merkle admitted that he had left the field without touching second, but only after umpire Emslie assured them that they had won the game. In 1914, O'Day said that Evers' tag was irrelevant: he had called the third out after McGinnity interfered with the throw from center field. Future Hall of Fame umpire Bill Klem said Merkle's boner was \"the rottenest decision in the history of baseball\"; Klem believed that the force rule was meant to apply to infield hits, not balls hit to the outfield.\n\nUnable to quickly clear the field of fans, O'Day ruled the game over on account of darkness. The game ended a 1–1 tie. National League president Harry Pulliam upheld the ruling. On October 2, Pulliam rejected the Giants' appeal of O'Day's ruling and the Cubs' call for a forfeit victory and again upheld the umpires, declaring the force play on Merkle valid and the game a tie. The Cubs-Giants-Pirates pennant race continued to the final days. The Giants were forced to end the season by playing 10 games in a week due to rainouts. After Merkle's boner, the Giants won 10 of their last 15 games to finish 98–55. The Cubs won eight of their last 10 after the Merkle game to also finish 98–55. The Pirates, who beat the Dodgers 2–1 on September 23 to gain a half game on their rivals, won nine of their last 10 to force a makeup game with the Cubs on October 4. The Cubs beat the Pirates 5–2, leaving themselves tied with the Giants, and with the Pirates a half-game back of both teams at 98–56, they were thus eliminated.\n\nOn October 6, the National League board of directors agreed with its umpires and with Hank Pulliam, making a final ruling that Merkle had failed to touch second base and that the force rule was correctly applied. This left the Cubs and Giants tied at 98–55 and required a makeup game to decide the NL pennant. To decide the pennant (and a spot in the World Series), the teams had to replay the tie game on October 8. Mathewson, scheduled to start the game, said, \"I'm not fit to pitch today. I'm dog tired.\" The crowd was estimated at 40,000, the biggest in baseball history at that time. Pfiester pitched for the Cubs again in the rematch, but was removed from the game in the first inning after hitting Tenney, walking Herzog (who was promptly picked off), giving up an RBI double to Donlin, and walking Seymour. Future Hall of Famer Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown entered the game in relief and got out of the jam without allowing another run crossing the plate. In the Cubs' half of the third inning, Tinker led off with a triple and scored on a single by Johnny Kling. Evers walked, Frank Schulte followed with an RBI double to give the Cubs the lead, and Frank Chance followed with a two-run double. From there, Chicago cruised to a 4–2 victory, becoming champions of the NL for the third straight year.\n\nThe Cubs went on to win the 1908 World Series, beating the Detroit Tigers four games to one. This was the Cubs' last world championship for more than a century: the next came in the 2016 World Series. The Pirates won the 1909 World Series, also against the Tigers. The Giants then returned to the World Series for three straight years, 1911–1913, only to lose each year—to the first of Connie Mack's two Philadelphia Athletics dynasties in and , and to the Boston Red Sox in . John McGraw's club did not win another championship until , when they defeated the emerging New York Yankees, featuring Babe Ruth, two consecutive years in the Yankees' first World Series appearances.\n\n\"The New York Times\" game story for September 23, 1908, blamed the loss on \"censurable stupidity on the part of player Merkle\". For the rest of his life, he lived with the nickname of \"Bonehead\". Merkle replaced Tenney as the full-time Giants first baseman in 1910 and was a regular for the Giants, Dodgers, and Cubs for another 10 years. He played in five World Series, all for the losing team. Bitter over the events of the Merkle's boner game, Merkle avoided baseball after his playing career finally ended in 1926. When he finally appeared at a Giants old-timers' game in 1950, he got a loud ovation from the fans.\n\nMerkle's Bar and Grill, a popular Wrigleyville bar just one block south of Wrigley Field in Chicago, is named after Fred Merkle, and features his image prominently in the bar's logo and interior. The bar's website recounts the story of Merkle's infamous baserunning gaffe, and its e-mail list is titled \"The Bonehead\".\n\nOn July 1, 2013, a minor league game between the Lansing Lugnuts and Great Lakes Loons featured a very similar play, in which an apparent game-winning single for the Lugnuts was nullified when the runner at first joined the celebration instead of advancing to second. The Lugnuts lost in extra innings.\n\n\n\n"}

It is home to the SIUE Cougars men's and women's soccer and outdoor track & field teams. In addition to the stands on the west side of the field, a berm was put in on the east side in 2011 to provide lawn seating for the tailgating fans known as \"The East Siders.\"\n\nThe stadium was constructed on university property surrounding the existing \"Bob Guelker Field\" in 1993–94 by the City of Edwardsville as a site to host the 1994 U.S. Olympic Festival. In 1998, the university trustees named the stadium to honor Ralph Korte, the founder of The Korte Company of Highland, an SIUE alumnus and strong advocate of the school.\nThe soccer playing surface was named, on November 1, 1986, in honor of Bob Guelker, the coach who inaugurated SIUE's men's soccer program and led it to the NCAA Division II championship in 1972 and the Division I crown in 1979.\n\nThe Korte Stadium and its earlier incarnation, Cougar Field, has hosted the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship in 1970 and 1975, the 1972 Division II Men's Soccer Championship, and the Division II NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in 1997, 1998, 2001, and 2003. It was also the home stadium for the Saint Louis Athletica of Women's Professional Soccer for part of their 2009 season, during which the capacity was expanded to 5,000 seats; the team later started playing at Anheuser-Busch Soccer Park.\n\nThe track features eight 48-inch lanes, with European-style broad turns (118 meters) and short straightaways (82 meters). The field event facilities include high jump aprons; pole vault runways; long jump/triple jump pits; shot put, discus, and hammer throw rings; and javelin throw runways on the west side, just outside the stadium grandstand.\n\nThe Gateway Arch on the St. Louis riverfront, 25 miles to the southwest, can be seen from the top of the stands at The Ralph.\n\nThe record single-day attendance for a track & field competition is 11,072 on July 10, 1994 at the U.S. Olympic Festival.\n\nAlthough an estimated crowd of over 8,000 was present for the 1971 Bronze Boot game versus St. Louis at Cougar Field, the largest soccer crowd in the stadium's current configuration was 4,665 for the Homecoming game against Bradley on October 4, 2014.\n\n"}

{"id": "4934587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4934587", "title": "Russell Brands", "text": "Russell Brands\n\nRussell Brands, LLC, headquartered in Bowling Green, Kentucky, is an American manufacturer of sports equipment, which markets its products under many brands and subsidiaries, including Russell Athletic (its flagship brand) and Spalding. Formerly a publicly traded company, Russell Brands has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway since 2006.\n\nThe original \"Russell Manufacturing Company\", founded by Benjamin Russell in Alexander City, Alabama, in 1902, became \"Russell Corporation\" in 1973, under the presidency of Eugene C. Gwaltney, Jr., who had taken over in 1968.\n\nBy 1990, the company owned and operated 13 sewing plants outside Alexander City and employed 15,000 workers. Since 1976, sales revenues had increased by 13 percent annually. With the acquisition of two subsidiaries, Quality Mills in North Carolina and Cloathbond Ltd. in Scotland, in 1988 and 1989 respectively, the company had become a global contender in the sportswear industry.\n\nUnder president and CEO John C. Adams, Russell Corporation had become the top manufacturer of athletic uniforms in the US. In 1992, the company was awarded a five-year contract to be the exclusive producer and marketer of athletic uniforms for most MLB teams. The contract also stipulated that the company held the exclusive right to manufacture and market replicas of major league uniforms, T-shirts and shorts. This put the company in an advantageous position in relation to its main rival, Champion, Inc., the supplier of uniforms to the NBA teams. In 1992 alone, Russell's international sales increased by 40 percent over 1991.\n\nAlthough sales and net income reached record levels in 1996, in part because of the impact of the Summer Olympics which were held in Atlanta that year, Russell's fortunes turned down in 1997 when both sales and net income fell. The decline was caused by intensifying competition as industry-wide over-capacity and price-cutting by rivals forced Russell to lower its own prices, all of which hurt the company's results. Particularly troubled was the Licensed Products Division, which Russell dissolved in 1997, dividing its operations among the other divisions. In 1997, Russell also ended its licensing deals with the professional football, basketball and hockey leagues.\n\nIn early 1998, as the company's troubles continued, Adams retired. John \"Jack\" Ward stepped in as chairman, president and CEO. Within months of his arrival, Russell announced a major restructuring. Over a three-year period, the company planned to eliminate about 4,000 jobs, or 23 percent of its workforce; close about 25 of its 90 plants, distribution centers and other facilities; and move most of the final assembly of garments abroad, to Mexico, Honduras and elsewhere in the Caribbean basin. The company expected to take charges of $100 to $125 million during the restructuring period. Russell hoped these efforts would result in annual savings of $50–$70 million. Part of these funds would then be used to bolster the marketing and advertising of Russell's brands, including tripling the advertising budget to $25 million per year. Russell also established a second headquarters in Atlanta in February 1999.\n\nRestructuring charges led Russell to post a net loss for fiscal year 1998 of $10.4 million on revenues of $1.18 billion. Results for the first half of 1999 also showed a net loss of $12.9 million but the restructuring had resulted in a decrease in selling, general and administration costs of 13 percent. Russell had also increased its offshore apparel assembly to 55 percent of total capacity, a substantial increase from the 17 percent level before the restructuring was launched. Russell had far to go before it could be considered fully turned around, but it appeared that the company was well on its way.\n\nThe company completed its restructuring process in 2001. Nearly all of its retail outlets had been closed, over 6,000 jobs had been cut, and most of its manufacturing operations had moved abroad. In 2000, Russell Corp. acquired the apparel operations for Haas Outdoors, Inc.. This later became the Mossy Oak Apparel Company. In 2002, the company added the Bike Athletic Company and Spalding to its holding. Russell continued its acquisition spree in 2004 by purchasing American Athletic Inc. (AAI), Huffy Corp.'s sports division and Brooks Sports. It also secured an extended contract to provide Spalding and Huffy branded products to the National Basketball Association.\n\nThe company faced challenges in 2005 due to rising costs and falling sales. During Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, over 40 containers of Russell products were lost or destroyed and nearly 70 percent of the ports it used for shipping were closed. Amid intense competition and faltering profits, the company launched a restructuring plan much like the effort of the late 1990s. Russell continued shifting its manufacturing base overseas and cut a total of 2,300 jobs.\n\nConglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc. acquired Russell Corporation for $600 million in early 2006. Berkshire, led by the billionaire Warren Buffett, believed Russell would be a good fit with its Fruit of the Loom Inc. subsidiary.\n\nThe Russell Corporation is made up of the following brands and their products:\n\nSince January 2009, Russell faced the largest collegiate boycott of an apparel company in history over labor violations in its Honduran factories. The boycott was co-ordinated by United Students Against Sweatshops in the United States and Canada in support of the Honduran garment workers' union SITRAJERZEESH.\n\nThe Worker Rights Consortium has documented violations of the rights of workers by Russell in its factory Jerzees de Honduras. The report found that Russell illegally fired nearly 2,000 in two of its factories, in retaliation for employees protesting against working conditions and forming a union. The report also stated that death threats were allegedly made against some members of the union, though not by senior management. In response, over eighty universities have canceled their contracts with Russell, including Duke University, Georgetown University, Columbia University, University of Michigan, University of Miami, University of Maryland, University of Washington, University of Houston, Penn State University, Rutgers University, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Purdue University, Cornell University, University of Florida, and the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.\n\nOn May 13, 2009, sixty-five members of Congress wrote to Russell CEO John Holland to express their concern over the labor violations. On June 25, 2009, Russell became the first collegiate licensee to be placed on probation by the Fair Labor Association.\n\nAt first, Russell said it was being unfairly targeted by the garment workers' union and student activists, and that the plant closure was due to the general downturn in the world economy. Five schools announced they planned to continue doing business with Russell. However, at least one of those, the University of Florida, has since terminated its licensing deal with Russell. The company had issued a statement noting that it had recognized the unionization of the Jerzees de Honduras plant on October 3, 2007. In later statements, the company admitted wrongdoing, although the violations are yet to be resolved.,\n\nThroughout its history, Russell Corporation has been involved in the manufacturing and selling of equipment for many professional, collegiate and high school sports teams. Most notable of these are its stint of manufacturing uniforms for MLB (through its flagship brand, Russell Athletic), the production of official basketballs for the NBA (through its subsidiary Spalding), and the production of official footballs for the AFL (under the Sherrin Brand).\n\n"}

The equipment ranges from balls, to nets, and to protective gear like helmets. Sporting equipment can be used as protective gear or as tool used to help the athletes play the sport. Over time, sporting equipment has evolved because sports have started to require more protective gear to prevent injuries. Sporting equipment may be found in any department store.\n\nThe ball is often what a sport requires and revolves around. A sports ball is typically round, but can also be in the shape of a prolate spheroid in the case of an American football or a rugby ball.\n\nSports are often named after the ball used, such as football, American football, baseball and basketball, or the ball is named after the sport.\n\nFlying discs are used for various games such as freestyle, disc golf and ultimate.\n\nIn many games, goal posts are at each end of the playing field, there are two vertical posts (or uprights) supporting a horizontal crossbar. In some games, such as football or hockey, the object is to pass the ball or puck between the posts below the crossbar, while in others, such as those based on rugby, the ball must pass over the crossbar instead.\n\nNets are used for tennis, volleyball, football, basketball, hockey and badminton.\nA different type of net is used for various forms of fishing.\n\nRacquets are used for racquet sports such as tennis, squash and badminton.\n\nFishing rods and fishing tackle are primarily used for fishing and sport fishing.\n\nSticks are used for sports such as hockey and lacrosse.\nBats are used for sports such as baseball and cricket.\nClubs are used mainly for golf (Golf club)\n\nWickets and balls are used in cricket, and bases are used in baseball.\n\nFootwear for sports includes:\n\nProtective equipment is often worn for sports including motor sport and contact sports, such as ice hockey and American football or sports where there is a danger of injury through collision of players or other objects. Protective equipment includes:\n\nExamples for training equipment include swiss balls, weights, chin-up bars, equipment for the gym. Also protective equipment such as weight lifting belts and bench shirts for weight training and powerlifting.\n\nVehicles (sometimes specialized) are used as equipment for some sports, including motor sport, cycling, aeronautics, sailing and hot air ballooning.\n\nSmall vehicles with flatbeds are often used to carry injured athletes off the field, most commonly in American football.\n\n\nHistorically many sports have developed their sporting equipment over time. For instance, the use of a football dates back to ancient China, between 225 BC and 220 AD. As football remains the most popular sport in the 21st century, the material of the ball has completely changed over the centuries; from being made out of animal skin, to being lined with multiple layers of polyester or cotton.\n\nAs the sporting equipment industry improves, so does the athletes performance. This is due to the fact that the equipment is more efficient, lighter and stronger it forming a bio-mechanical system, interacting with the athlete.\n\nSince the massive adoption of wearable, new sport equipment tend to be electronics and connected to deliver data performances.\n\n"}
