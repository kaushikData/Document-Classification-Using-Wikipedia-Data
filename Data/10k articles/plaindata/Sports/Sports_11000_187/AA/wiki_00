This FIBA AmeriCup tournament was held in Caracas, Venezuela, from August 30, to September 11, 2013. The top four teams qualified for the 2014 FIBA World Cup.\n\nMexico defeated Puerto Rico, in the final, to win their first AmeriCup title.\n\n\n\nThe draw was held at the Catia Theatre in Caracas on February 28. This was how the teams were seeded:\n\nAs hosts, Venezuela picked first the group that they played at, and their final opponent in the preliminary round. Included are the last published FIBA World Rankings prior to the draw.\n\nThe ten teams were split into two groups. The best four teams of each group advanced to the second round, where the teams played against the four teams from the other group; each team carried over all points earned during the first round, except for those earned in the match against the team that was eliminated. The best four teams of this group advanced to the semifinals and were qualified for the 2014 FIBA World Cup. The United States, which won the Olympic Gold Medal in 2012, automatically qualified for the 2014 FIBA Tournament and does not have to participate as a result. Originally, Panama were supposed to compete for the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship, but was replaced by Mexico after FIBA implemented a suspension on the Panamanian Basketball Federation. Mexico was chosen as the next highest placed finisher in Panama's subcategory (COCABA) at the 2012 Centrobasket tournament.\n\nIn Group A, team Puerto Rico secured their first round undefeated, as well as narrowly clinching their win against surprising newcomer Jamaica 88–82, while Canada and Uruguay also secured their place for the second round. Brazil lost all four games for the first time.\n\nHosts Venezuela lost their first two games against surprising Mexico and Argentina, but managed to win two other games to advance the second round, despite having two losses in the game. The Mexican team lost their three-win streak to the Argentine basketball team, while Paraguay's poor efforts prevented them from winning a single game since their recent game in 2010.\n\nPuerto Rico narrowly clinched their place for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup against surprising hosts Venezuela in an 85–86 thriller of an overtime match. Meanwhile, upstart Mexico also clinched their position for the World Cup from their performance, while Dominican Republic and Argentina also secured their place for the World Cup. Despite the efforts, the Canadian team were unable to put up a defensive and offensive play, thus eliminating the team for the second time since 2011. Newcomers Jamaica was also eliminated, despite winning against the Argentine team, whereas Uruguay were unable to make their debut for the Championship round, losing half of the matches throughout the Second Round.\n\nMexico avenged their first-round loss to world third-ranked Argentina, becoming the first team to advance to the final round. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico avenged their second-round loss against the Dominican team to secure their place in the final match against Mexico.\n\n\nPoints\n\nRebounds\n\nAssists\n\nBlocks\n\nSteals\n"}

It has been described as \"alligator capturing techniques\".\n\nSoutheastern Native Americans hunted alligators as a food source for thousands of years. At the turn of the 20th century, showing off alligators as roadside attractions helped Native Americans generate revenue. Long before the first Europeans explorers wandered into the Florida Everglades, alligator wrestling existed. For tribes like the Seminole and Miccosukee, learning how to \"handle\" the reptiles was part of their existence.\n\nA common symbol of Florida in popular culture is the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). Alligators, also known colloquially as \"gators,\" are part of Florida's popular culture ranging from tourist attractions and alligator wrestlers to postcards and team mascots such as that of the University of Florida. The St. Augustine Alligator Farm was one of Florida's earliest themed tourist attractions that opened for business in 1893. At the St. Augustine Alligator Farm and other tourist attractions such as Gatorland and the Silver Springs Nature Park, \"taming\" or hypnotizing alligators was a popular trick, along with other performances such as alligator wrestling.\n\n"}

{"id": "4734836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4734836", "title": "Bluegrass Miracle", "text": "Bluegrass Miracle\n\nThe Bluegrass Miracle was a 74-yard game-winning touchdown pass by the No. 16 LSU Tigers with no time left on the clock against the Kentucky Wildcats on November 9, 2002 at Commonwealth Stadium in Lexington, Kentucky. The ball was tipped by a Kentucky player before being caught at the 15-yard line by Devery Henderson of LSU, who ran it in for the score.\n\nKentucky, the home team, was the underdog to the defending SEC champion Tigers. LSU was ahead by as many as 14 points at one point and led 24–14 after a field goal with 13:58 left in the fourth quarter, but Kentucky came back with a 13–3 run to tie it at 27. However, a Kentucky player called the Wildcats' last timeout on first down from the LSU 11 with 15 seconds left on the clock, and rather than risking a turnover or a tackle within the field of play that would leave the clock running and the Wildcats unable to line up to spike the football, head coach Guy Morriss opted to send kicker Taylor Begley out to kick a 29-yard field goal, giving the Wildcats a 30–27 lead with 11 seconds left on the clock. LSU got the ball back, but the ensuing kickoff pinned the team at its own 9-yard line. On the first play of the series, the Tigers quickly got the ball to their own 26-yard line on a pass from quarterback Marcus Randall to wide receiver Michael Clayton. An LSU timeout stopped the clock with 2 seconds left, and set up a desperation Hail Mary pass. The chances for success were considered slim because Randall's arm was not strong enough to reach the opponent's end zone from 70+ yards away. Kentucky players were so confident that they had won the game that they gave Morriss a Gatorade bath before the final play had taken place.\n\nOn the final play of the game, LSU called the play \"Dash Right 93 Berlin\". Tigers quarterback Marcus Randall took the ball and threw it from his own 18 yard line as far as he could downfield. Soon after Randall released the ball, triumphant Kentucky fans stormed the field around Randall. The pass was 25 yards short of the end zone. However, the ball was deflected off the hand of a Kentucky player between the Kentucky 30 and 25 yard lines and fell into the hands of LSU wide receiver Devery Henderson just short of the 15-yard line. Henderson broke an attempt at a shoestring tackle by the last Kentucky defender and ran into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown.\n\nWhile Henderson crossed the end zone, the Jefferson Pilot Sports television broadcast accidentally posted the graphic \"Kentucky 30, LSU 27—FINAL.\" LSU had actually just won the game 33–30. After the touchdown, Jefferson Pilot Sports play-by-play announcer Dave Neal called the play, \"The most shocking, improbable, unbelievable sequence of events.\" In his television interview right after the play, LSU head coach Nick Saban said, \"I don't know what to say. I feel bad for Kentucky's players. But this is a big moment for us and I'm happy as heck for our team...Well, sometimes you gotta be a little lucky and I think that was our luck right there.\" Kentucky fans who were already on the field could not believe what had happened. Fireworks spewed out of the Commonwealth Stadium suites to herald the apparent Kentucky win when the game clock read \"0:00\", even prior to the Hail Mary pass. After the play, Tom Leach, Kentucky's radio play-by-play announcer, said, \"How much heartbreak. (Kentucky) fans are up on the goal posts. I don't know why.\" LSU's play-by-play announcer Jim Hawthorne, was equally shocked and was also at a loss for an explanation; he initially said that LSU defensive back Jack Hunt (who had converted from wide receiver in 2002), not Devery Henderson, scored the touchdown. Hunt's uniform number was 8; Henderson's was 9.\n\nOn the day after the game, Baton Rouge's daily newspaper, \"The Advocate\", ran the headline \"HAIL TIGERS\" on the sports page. The headline is a reference to the Hail Mary pass used to win the game. On back of the sports page, it also provided a shot-by-shot camera sequence of the play. The page also included a graphic outlining the sequence of events. They were accompanied by the headline \"Dash Right 93 Berlin,\" which was the play run that won the game.\n\nThe play became permanently known as the \"Bluegrass Miracle\" after a poll of LSU fans was conducted on the LSU Sports website days later. Other website suggestions for the name included \"The Bluegrass Bomb\" and \"Miracle on the Bluegrass.\" The website also received write-in votes for such names as \"The Divine Deflection,\" \"It Works Devery Time,\" and \"The Lexington Longshot.\"\n\nThe \"Bluegrass Miracle\" also won the 2003 Best Play ESPY Award. It beat out plays from Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Michael Vick and Barry Bonds. Devery Henderson accepted the award on behalf of the LSU team. It was the second time an LSU miracle play won an ESPY award: Warren Morris had won the 1997 Showstopper of the Year ESPY Award for his two out, walk-off home run in the 1996 College World Series championship game.\n\nIt also marked the second time in as many years that LSU foiled a Kentucky football comeback in the final moments of the game. In the 2001 game, also at Kentucky, the Tigers won 29–25, on a touchdown pass from Marcus Randall to Devery Henderson with 13 seconds left in the game. Earlier in the game, Kentucky had overcome a 12-point halftime deficit to take the lead in the 4th quarter.\n\n"}

At the formation eleven gentlemen only enrolled their names but in 1786 their numbers increased to 30 and in the following year when their meetings were removed to Dartford Heath and held every Saturday during the months of May, June, July and August they numbered 61 and when it was known to be patronized by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales the numbers increased to 123, among whom were some of the highest nobility. The Heath again became the favourite resort of youth and beauty, assembled to behold the splendid costume of the members, and witness their skill in archery\". He continued: \"The house is traditionally said to have been the scene of many midnight revels and orgies. The members previous to the breaking up of the society, fitted up an apartment, in which they frequently acted plays and other dramatic pieces, to which the inhabitants of the neighbourhood were invited by tickets\".Here knights and damsels met in splendid show Hailed the bright goddess of the silver bow, And maids of Kent, expert in piercing hearts, Supplied the archers with their eyes for darts; From Love's artillery discharged their lances And vanquish Cantia's heroes with their glances. — Ye Virgin Sisters of chaste Dian's train Have pity on the Archers ye have slain For oh, what armour can secure be found When arrows sharp as yours inflict the wound. \"A poem presented to E.M. Potts at Bowman's Lodge c. 1834; lines by Miss Talbot, published in \"Moonshine\", p.346\" In 1779-80 a shop, the Suttling house, stood near Bowman's Lodge, kept by Mr. Powell of the Granby, Dartford, for the purpose of supplying troops with stationery and small stores while they were camped on the heath preparing for a foreign invasion.\n\nBowman's Lodge was the venue for four cricket matches played between 1795 and 1809 which were given retrospective first-class cricket status. Two matches were held between an England side and a Hampshire team in 1795. A Kent side played England in 1805 and the final top-class match at the ground came in 1809 between England and a Surrey team. The exact location of the ground on the heath is unknown, though the land opposite the lodge is presently laid out with football pitches and is a possible site of the cricket matches.\n\nFor about 60 years, the lodge was home to William Cracroft Fooks QC (1812-99), Barrister at Law, JP for the county of Kent. He was instrumental in the rejection of a proposal to build a ship canal from the Thames to Dartford Creek. He also organised the formation of a volunteer rifle corps in the Dartford area to prepare for a possible invasion of Britain by Napoleon III.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries gravel was excavated in the area and numerous Palaeolithic flint implements were discovered in Bowman's Lodge Pit, which was located between the house and Chastilian Road. In the 20th century the pit was filled in and returned to heathland.\n\nThe lodge is thought to have had connections with Lord Tredegar until well into the 1900s. It was torn down in about 1987 and replaced with two modern dwellings. Swan Lane, the road running past the property, remained a dirt track until the 1980s when it was upgraded and became part of the main signposted route to Crayford from the Dartford Heath junction of the A2.\n"}

It was caused by an incident at the finals of the 1972 world men's curling championship, the 1972 Air Canada Silver Broom in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.\n\nThe Canadian team, skipped by Orest Meleschuk was playing the American team skipped by Robert LaBonte in the finals. Canada had been undefeated up until this point, but was down by two points in the last end. They needed two points to tie the game. Meleschuk had the \"hammer\", the final shot of the end. When it was time for him to shoot, the Americans had shot rock on the button while Canada was sitting second shot right next to it. The U.S. was sitting third rock with a rock biting the 8-foot. To tie the game, Meleschuk had to hit the American rock and not roll further than this third rock.\n\nMeleschuk's rock made the hit, and it proceeded to roll into the 8-foot. When it stopped, it was close to being second, but the Americans thought otherwise, and U.S. third Frank Aasand jumped in the air to celebrate. In the meantime, Canada's third Dave Romano was still investigating which rock was second rock, and thus whether or not Canada had scored two to tie, or just one for the loss. While Romano was looking, LaBonte jumped in the air to celebrate as well, but slipped and accidentally kicked the Canadian stone. Romano had still not agreed on who was shot, and since LaBonte had kicked the rock closer than the American rock, Canada was awarded two points in the end. Canada then stole another point in the extra end to win the championship after LaBonte was heavy with a draw for the win.\n\nIt was later said that LaBonte put a \"curse\" on Canada, because Canada did not win another World Championship until 1980. Canadian journalist Larry Tucker is generally considered to have been given credit for inventing the hex in 1980 to describe Canada's victory that year.\n\nA secondary \"curse\", if interpreted in this way, is that a North Dakotan rink did not represent the United States again in the World Curling Championships until 1997, when Craig Disher of Langdon represented the United States.\n\nThis is the final score of the final of the 1972 Air Canada Silver Broom.\n"}

To steer the sled, riders may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, or pull on the rope attached to the wooden cross-piece. Shifting the cross-piece one way or the other causes the flexible rails to bend, turning the sled.\n\nFlexible Flyers work best on hard packed or icy snow. If the snow is soft and deep, the sled's runners are likely to sink in and prevent the sled from moving.\n\nSamuel Leeds Allen patented the Flexible Flyer in 1889. in Cinnaminson, New Jersey using local children and adults to test prototypes. Allen's company flourished by selling these speedy and yet controllable sleds at a time when others were still producing toboggans and \"gooseneck\" sleds.\n\nAllen began producing sleds in his farm equipment factory to keep his workers busy even when it was not the farm season.

It has several racetracks varying from 1,000 to 4,000 metres in length with 46 different starting posts. The course is home to more than half of the group one races held in France, and has a capacity of 50,000. The highlight of the calendar is the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Held on the first weekend in October, the prestigious event attracts the best horses from around the world.\n\nThe first-ever race run at Longchamp was on Sunday, April 27, 1857 in front of a massive crowd. The Emperor Napoleon III and his wife Eugénie were present, having sailed down the Seine River on their private yacht to watch the third race. Until 1930, many Parisians came to the track down the river on steamboats and various other vessels, the trip taking around an hour to the Pont de Suresnes. The royal couple joined Prince Jérôme Bonaparte and his son Prince Napoleon in the Royal Enclosure alongside the Prince of Nassau, Prince Murat and the Duke of Morny, an avid racegoer. Non-aristocratic members of the upper classes were not permitted into the Royal enclosure and had to be content with watching from their barouche carriages on the lawn.\n\nA number of prominent artists have painted horse racing scenes at Longchamp including the one seen here by Édouard Manet in 1867 and another four years later by Edgar Degas titled \"Race Horses at Longchamp\".\n\nRacing continued during the German occupation of France in World War II, with many German officers in the stands.\n\n"}

It is the university's venue for football and women's soccer for the Nevada Wolf Pack of the Mountain West Conference. It was named after the Mackay family, benefactors of the university by Clarence and John Mackay.\n\nLocated on the northern portion of campus, at 17th Street & East Stadium Way, the stadium opened on October 1, 1966 with a seating capacity of 7,500. It replaced the original Mackay Stadium, formerly located in the bowl containing Hilliard Plaza, the Mack Social Sciences building, and the Reynolds School of Journalism. Both stadiums were named for the Mackay family, who were university benefactors in the early years of the school. The stadium currently seats 27,000 and has played to crowds in excess. The field sits at an elevation of above sea level and runs in a NW to SE configuration, with the press box on the southwest sideline. \n\nPermanent lighting was installed in 2003 to allow the option of night games. Originally natural grass, synthetic infill FieldTurf was installed in 2000 and replaced in 2010. In 2013, the playing surface at Mackay Stadium was named Chris Ault Field in honor of the former Wolf Pack head coach, College Football Hall of Famer, creator of the Pistol offense in 2005 and for his contributions to Wolf Pack football.\n\nA proposal passed by the Nevada Board of Regents (NSHE) upgraded seating options to the stadium for the 2016 season. This renovation has improved the quality of the fans' experiences but decreased the overall stadium capacity to 26,000. Higher ticket fees in the upgraded sections will repay this $11.5 million bond by 2031.\n\nThe Wolf Pack football single-season attendance record was set in 1991 with a total of 180,457 fans over nine home games, including playoffs; and the regular-season attendance record was set at 151,081 fans in 1993. The single-season attendance record for a Wolf Pack team with a losing record (at 149,635 fans) was set in 2013. 2014 was the third football season to have at least 20,000 fans in attendance at every home game (1993 and 2013), although multiple seasons were close.\n\nThe Nevada women's soccer team has hosted home crowds with over 1,000 on three occasions. The record was actually set at the Moana Sports Complex in Reno on September 15, 2013, with a record of 1,050 fans in attendance, where the Wolf Pack beat the Sacramento State Hornets, 3–2. Soccer's home-game attendance record at Mackay Stadium is 1,043 fans, as the Wolf Pack beat Wyoming, 1–0, on October 18, 2015. The third-largest Nevada soccer game with over 1,000 fans was also held at Mackay Stadium with 1,007 fans on September 23, 2012, as the Wolf Pack lost 0-3 to #15 California.\n\n\n"}

NERD was originally created by Carson Cistulli and is part of his project of exploring the \"art\" of sabermetric research. The original NERD formula only took into account the pitcher's expected performance while the current model factors in the entire team's performance.\n\nThe premise for NERD was developed in Cistulli's piece \"Why We Watch\" in which he establishes the five reasons that baseball continues to captivate the American imagination from game to game: \"Pitching Matchups,\" \"Statistically Notable (or Otherwise Compelling) Players,\" \"Rookies (and Debuts),\" \"Seasonal Context,\" and \"Quality of Broadcast\". Fellow sabermatrician Rob Neyer, who had collaborated with Cistulli on this piece, wrote \"the only thing missing [...] is a points system that would let us put a number on each game\" and on June 2, 2010 Cistulli unveiled the NERD Pitching formula.\n\nNERD pitching tries to determine which pitchers will be the most aesthetically appealing to watch for a baseball fan and is both a historical and a predictive statistic. The NERD pitching formula uses a player's standard deviations from the mean (a weighted z-score) of the DIPS statistic xFIP (expected Fielding Independent Pitching), swinging strike percentage, overall strike percentage, and the differential between the pitcher's ERA and xFIP to determine a quantitative value for each pitcher.\n\nformula_1\n\nThe factor of 4.69 is added to make the number fit on a 0 to 10 scale. While there has been some disagreement on the calculation of Cistulli's luck component, the general consensus among sports writers seems to be that a player with a below-average ERA and an above-average xFIP has been \"unlucky\".\n\nFollowing the model of his Pitching NERD, Team NERD tries to give a quantitative value to the aesthetic value of each of the 30 baseball teams. For factors it accounts for \"Age,\" \"Park-Adjusted weighted Runs Above Average (wRAA),\" \"Park-Adjusted Home Run per Fly Ball (HR/FB),\" \"Team Speed,\" \"Bullpen Strength,\" \"Team Defense,\" \"Luck\" (Base Runs – Actual Runs Scored), and \"Payroll\".\n\nformula_2\n\nIn a recent interview Cistulli admitted that there is a disconnect between The Rays high tNERD rating and low attendance saying that he is considered adding a \"park-adjustment\" to his formula which would reflect either the stadium itself or \"attendance relative to the stadium's capacity\" but overall reception of this statistic has been positive and Fangraphs started reporting Team NERD in Cistulli's One Night Only columns beginning August 23, 2010.\n"}

The stadium is designed with a capacity of 45,360 people.\n\n\"Otkritie Arena\", named after the sponsor Otkritie Holding, is the commercial name for the Spartak Stadium until 2019.\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony was held on 2 July 2007, but construction was delayed multiple times for different reasons. Construction was scheduled to be completed between 2009 and 2010 but, as of 2009, the stadium was still in the design stage. In 2010, the stadium project underwent revision because it was rejected by an architectural council that found the project too ordinary. The current design was developed by AECOM, in association with Sport Concepts, and façade designer, Dexter Moren Associates adjacent to a separate indoor arena. The main financing of the construction came from the club's owner Leonid Fedun through affiliated companies LUKoil company and IFD Kapital.\n\nWith the construction of the stadium in 2015, the Moscow Metro station Spartak, which had been completed in 1975, opened for passenger traffic. On 19 February 2013 it was announced that the new stadium will be named \"Otkrytiye Arena\" for six years under the terms of the contract with Otkrytiye Bank. On 21 August 2014, a monument to the Starostin brothers, the founders of FC Spartak Moscow, opened near the north stands inside the stadium. A 24.5-meter sculpture of the Roman Gladiator Spartacus, for whom the club is named, was unveiled in the square outside the stadium.\n\nThe stadium officially opened on 5 September 2014. Spartak played against Red Star Belgrade and drew 1–1, with Dmitri Kombarov scoring the first goal for Spartak at the new stadium after a free-kick.\nThe stadium was constructed on the site of the Tushino Airport. The new stadium was included in Russia's bid for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, hosting the opening game, with Luzhniki Stadium slated to host the final. The stadium was completed ahead of VTB Arena, which originally was planned for the World Cup opener. It was also one of four stadiums used for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.

{"id": "1147879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1147879", "title": "Sledging (cricket)", "text": "Sledging (cricket)\n\nSledging is a term used in cricket to describe the practice whereby some players seek to gain an advantage by insulting or verbally intimidating the opposing player. The purpose is to try to weaken the opponent's concentration, thereby causing them to make mistakes or underperform. It can be effective because the batsman stands within hearing range of the bowler and certain close fielders; and \"vice versa\". The insults may be direct or feature in conversations among fielders designed to be overheard. The term has also been used in other sports, as when the tennis player Nick Kyrgios insulted his opponent, Stan Wawrinka, by referring to a purported encounter between another player and the latter's girlfriend.\n\nThere is debate in the cricketing world as to whether this constitutes poor sportsmanship or good-humoured banter. Sledging is sometimes interpreted as abuse, and it is acknowledged some comments aimed as sledges do sometimes cross the line into personal abuse, however, this is not always the case. Sledging can sometimes be a humorous attempt at distraction. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh referred to the practice as 'mental disintegration'.\n\nAustralian newspapers acknowledged \"sledging\" as a term in the mid-1970s. Despite the relatively recent coining of the term, the practice is as old as cricket itself, with historical accounts of witty banter between players being quite common. W. G. Grace and his brother E. M. were noted throughout their careers for being \"noisy and boisterous\" on the field. W. G. admitted that they used to \"chaff\" (i.e., tease) opponents, and this is seen as part of the gamesmanship for which E. M. and W. G. were always controversial.\n\nAccording to Ian Chappell, the use of \"sledging\" as a term originated at Adelaide Oval in either the 1963–1964 or 1964–1965 Sheffield Shield competition. Chappell claims that a cricketer who swore in the presence of a woman was said to have reacted to an incident \"like a sledgehammer\". As a result, the direction of insults or obscenities at opponents became known as \"sledging\".\n\nAccording to the BBC’s Pat Murphy: “My understanding is that it came from the mid-sixties and a guy called Grahame Corling, who used to open the bowling for New South Wales and Australia … apparently the suggestion was that this guy's wife was [having an affair] with another team-mate, and when he came into bat [the fielding team] started singing When a Man Loves A Woman, the old Percy Sledge number.”\n\nThe 1974–75 Australians were labelled the \"Ugly Australians\" for their hard-nosed cricket, verbal abuse and hostile fast bowling. \"Behind the batsmen, Rod Marsh and his captain Ian Chappell would vie with each other in profanity\", and Tom Graveney wrote \"It was an open secret that he used to encourage his players to give a lot of verbal abuse to rival batsman when they were at the wicket in an attempt to break their concentration.\"\n\nWest Indian batsman Viv Richards was notorious for punishing bowlers that dared to sledge him. So much so, that many opposing captains banned their players from the practice. However, in a county game against Glamorgan, Greg Thomas attempted to sledge him after he had played and missed at several balls in a row. He informed Richards: \"It's red, round and weighs about five ounces, in case you were wondering.\" Richards hammered the next delivery out of the cricket grounds and into the nearby river Taff. Turning to the bowler, he commented: \"Greg, you know what it looks like, now go and find it.\"\n\nIt has been pointed out that the Australian cricket team believes in playing in a more 'robust' fashion than others and that it upholds a 'sledging culture'. Australian bowler Merv Hughes has claimed that he credits sledging for twenty-five percent of the wickets he has taken. As per Australian cricketer Mark Taylor, Australian fans want to watch 'combative cricket'. Australian batsman Ricky Ponting has argued that sledging helps get players 'out of control' and 'out of their comfort zone'. Ponting has also said that it's 'not as bad' as the average person would think. Australian spinner Shane Warne describes sledging as an 'effective cricketing weapon'. On Allan Border's advice, Warne has also adopted sledging as a technique to 'switch on' for a contest. Australian all-rounder Michael Clarke has said that he 'loved the aggressive approach'. In response to 'personal sledging' accusations against his team, Australian cricketer Steve Smith has said, \"Getting personal on the field is not on, that's crossing the line in my opinion.\" By contrast, Australian opener Ed Cowan suggests that 'all sledging is personal' adding that Australian cricketers should be 'nowhere near the line'.\n\nBefore the controversial Test series during Australia's Tour of South Africa in 2018 commenced, Australian spinner Nathan Lyon commented on sledging: \"We know where the line is. We headbutt it, but we don’t go over it.\" Following the 2018 Australian ball-tampering scandal, voices calling for a reformation of Australia's 'cricket culture' have emerged. Australian Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull called for an end to sledging following the scandal. Following the outrage over the scandal, former Australian cricketer Justin Langer said that cricket would be 'dull' without sledging. Australian batsman David Warner who received a one-year ban following the controversial series, exclaimed: \"I play with aggression on the field and I try not to cross that line\". Former Australian cricketer and former coach of the Australian team Darren Lehmann has suggested that Australia is 'not as bad' as portrayed, adding that sledging was worse during his own times.\n\nHistorically described as a 'timid' side, Bangladesh underwent a transformation as they grew in confidence following the 2015 Cricket World Cup, according to Bangladeshi cricketer Mashrafe Mortaza. Mortaza says that he encourages his players to 'look the opponent in the eye' while 'not overstepping a line'. He also insists that his side 'does not start a conversation' on the field. Bangladesh former cricketer and commentator Athar Ali Khan says that Bangladesh has moved out of a 'culture of backing off'.\n\nEngland coach Trevor Bayliss expressed disapproval over sledging being caught on the stump mics, suggesting that sledging must be censored on television as it isn't a 'great thing for young kids at home watching'. England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow has expressed a need for greater clarity with regard to what is 'personal', pointing out that there are so many grey areas around the 'line'. Before England's Tour of New Zealand in 2018, former English cricketer Geoffrey Boycott called for English cricketers to 'drop' sledging.\n\nSaurav Ganguly is known to be among India's first 'aggressive' captains who employed sledging on the field. Indian batsman Virender Sehwag has said, \"If there's no sledging, there won't be any enjoyment left in the game.\" Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir said it's fine to do 'whatever you can to upset the opposition till the time you don't get personal.' Indian wicketkeeper MS Dhoni has described sledging as an 'art' and has said it is fair as long as a 'line' isn't crossed. Indian pacer Sreesanth has said that sledging is 'part and parcel' of the game. Indian bowler Irfan Pathan has said that sledging has a 'certain charm' about it also adding that it should be done 'within limits'. Indian legend Sachin Tendulkar has called for sledging within 'certain limits' in his autobiography Playing It My Way. Former Indian cricketer and commentator Sunil Gavaskar explains that sledging is done to 'disrupt a cricketer's concentration'. Former Indian wicketkeeper Mohammad Kaif excalimed that sledging is fine but verbals must not extend to 'family'.\n\nIndian cricket captain Virat Kohli said, \"We take it very well and we give it back even better.\" Ganguly has stated that Kohli's aggression is 'two-times more' than his own. Under Kohli's captaincy, players are required to have 'top fitness, high intensity and an aggressive mindset'. Sachin Tendulkar has pointed out that aggression has become the strength of the Indian team under Kohli. Indian Test cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara said that he makes 'a lot of noise on the field' and believes that sledging 'helps the bowlers'. Indian batsman Ajinkya Rahane has compared sledging (on the cricket field) to 'car honking while driving'.\n\nPakistani cricketer Imran Khan has mentioned that his players 'learnt' aggression during Pakistan's 1972-73 tour of Australia. Khan specifically mentioned Sarfaraz Nawaz among the players that 'picked up sledging' from the Australians. In 1999, the Pakistan Cricket Board lodged an official complaint to its Australian counterpart over 'persistent sledging' and the use of 'highly abusive language' against Pakistani players. Before Pakistan's Tour of Australia in 2004, then Pakistani captain Inzamam-ul-Haq made it clear that his players will 'give what they get' if subjected to sledging. Pakistani paceman Wasim Akram has emphasised that what is said on the field should remain on the field.\n\nSouth African skipper Faf Du Plessis remarked that \"If showing aggression is considered a breach of conduct, we could rather have bowling machines bowl to a batsman.\"\n\nThe Sri Lankan Cricket Team has had a reputation of avoiding verbal aggression. Former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga called for a ban on sledging in early 2008 with particular reference to Australia's interactions with touring sides. Former Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara drew a clear distinction between aggression 'on the field' and verbal sledging, remarking that the two are different from each other.\n\nThe West Indies Cricket Team is known to have had 'feared pace attacks' during the 1980s. According to West Indies great Viv Richards, sledging is an 'inevitable part' of modern-day cricket. Richards further expounds that 'racial' slurring translates to crossing the line, comparing it to 'being hit in the nuts' and asserting that it is unacceptable.\n\n\n"}

In 1955 Press moved to Saint Petersburg to train under the renowned coach Viktor Alekseyev. Next year she was shortlisted for the Olympic team, but lost due to a strong domestic competition in the throwing events.\n\nBoth sisters were accused of being men or intersex, and therefore sometimes called the \"Press Brothers\". They retired in 1966, before gender verification became mandatory on location. In retirement Press worked as an athletics coach and official in Moscow. She also wrote several books on sport, social and economical subjects. In 1974 she defended a PhD in pedagogy.

The device is basically two pieces of metal tube bent in a loop and connected with a hinge. The intended use is to put the Thighmaster between the knees and squeeze them together. This exercises the hip adductors. The simple mechanism allows exercising any suitable muscle where a small angle can be created to press it, for example the biceps (elbow flexion) or the hamstrings (knee flexion).\n\nAs with most fitness products marketed to homes, advertisements often emphasized that the Thighmaster could be used while doing something else. The infomercials featured people watching television and exercising with the Thighmaster at the same time. It was mainly advertised in the 1990s by the actress Suzanne Somers.\n\nThe Thighmaster was marketed by Joshua Reynolds, who also made a great deal of money with his version of the Mood ring.
