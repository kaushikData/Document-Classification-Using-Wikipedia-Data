It was contested between Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, seeded 17th and 20th respectively. Osaka defeated Williams in straight sets, 6-2, 6-4 in one hour and 19 minutes.\n\nThe match was historically significant for both players. It was Williams' first US Open after a 12-month hiatus to give birth to her first child in September 2017, and second attempt since her pregnancy (after that year's Wimbledon) to equal Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 Grand Slam titles. Osaka was the first Japanese player to contest a Grand Slam women's singles final, and was attempting to become the first able-bodied Japanese player, male or female, to win a Grand Slam singles title.\n\nThe match generated significant controversy due to a series of altercations between Williams and chair umpire Carlos Ramos during the second set. Williams' on-court behavior and Ramos' disciplinary actions, and Williams' responses, particularly her invocation of perceived sexism during her arguments with Ramos and officials, and following the match, polarised the tennis community and media worldwide.\n\nThe pair met only once previously, with Osaka winning in straight sets in the first round of the 2018 Miami Open.\n\nAt the start of the tournament, Williams had won 23 Grand Slam championships, the most in the Open Era, and second-most of all time, and was attempting to equal Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 Grand Slam championships, which required her to best her own record of being the oldest female Grand Slam women's singles champion at the time set at the 2017 Australian Open.\n\n2018 marked a highly anticipated comeback for Williams since giving birth in September 2017. Her prior successes, and consequent status as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, attracted significant media interest in her pregnancy and motherhood, where she openly revealed almost suffering near-fatal childbirth-related complications as a result of an emergency Caesarian section, requiring five surgeries and leaving her bedridden for six weeks. She used her struggle to cast light on the issue, consequently being hailed as an inspiration for mothers overall, further adding to public anticipation towards her return to tour.\n\nWilliams' return was, however, difficult. Originally intending to return for the 2018 Australian Open, complications from her pregnancy caused her to miss the tournament, leaving her unable to defend her title from the previous year, and delay her return until the Indian Wells Masters that February, where she lost to older sister Venus in the third round. In the Miami Open two weeks later, Williams would face Osaka for the first time, and only time until their US Open match, in the first round, where Osaka upset Williams in straight sets - Williams' earliest ever exit from the Miami Open in her career. Williams' first Grand Slam campaign since her return at the French Open ended disappointingly, as she withdrew before her fourth round match against Maria Sharapova. However, her Wimbledon campaign the following month was more successful, reaching the final. Despite losing to Angelique Kerber in straight sets, her feat of reaching the final in the first place was seen as both a return to form—Sonia Oxley of BBC Sport quipping that \"she still has the stamina, spirit and shots to carry on collecting Grand Slam titles\", and 2016 men's singles champion Andy Murray noting that \"It is tough to bet against her now she's got this far\"—and a reinforcement of her status as an icon of motherhood and women's empowerment.\n\nOsaka was relatively unknown, beginning the year ranked No. 68, having only entered the top 50 briefly in 2016, and having neither been seeded in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament nor advanced beyond the third round. She had, however, made a break at the 2017 US Open, upsetting defending champion Angelique Kerber in the first round, 6–3, 6–1. She improved upon her Grand Slam record at the 2018 Australian Open, advancing to the fourth round where she lost to world No. 1 and eventual runner-up Simona Halep in straight sets, 6–3, 6–2.\n\nFollowing her 2018 Australian Open campaign, Osaka earned the biggest win of her career at Indian Wells, during which she defeated former World No. 1s Maria Sharapova and Karolína Plíšková, and avenged her Australian Open loss to Halep in the semi-final, before defeating Daria Kasatkina in the final to claim her biggest championship yet. Subsequently, she entered the 2018 French Open seeded 21st, the first Grand Slam tournament in which she was seeded in the main draw. By mid-August 2018, Osaka attained the highest ranking yet of her career at World No. 17, and was the youngest player in the WTA's top 20.\n\nOsaka entered the main draw of the US Open seeded 20th; however, early round losses on her side of the draw, including those of Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki and Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitová, meant that Osaka did not face any player seeded above her until her semi-final with Madison Keys. Osaka qualified for the final having only dropped one set during the entire tournament (in the fourth round against Aryna Sabalenka), and by beating Keys in the semi-final 6–2, 6–4, a match during which she saved all 13 break points she faced. Osaka was the first player from Japan to contest a Grand Slam women's singles final (the second Japanese able-bodied player overall after Kei Nishikori at the 2014 US Open, and fourth player overall after Nishikori, Yui Kamiji and Shingo Kunieda), and was attempting to become the first able-bodied Japanese player, male or female, to win a Grand Slam singles title.\n\nOsaka's personal admiration for Williams as a primary inspiration for her tennis career was a focal point of the media's interest in her rise. Upon defeating Maria Sharapova in her successful 2018 Indian Wells campaign, Osaka quipped, \"There are three people I wanted to play, Venus, [Sharapova] and Serena. Now I'm just waiting to play Serena.\" Williams has been described as Osaka's \"hero\" and \"idol\", and the US Open final matchup as Osaka's childhood dream; Osaka's focus has been described as \"solely on becoming the next Serena\", Osaka herself remarking that, during challenging scenarios on court, she thinks \"What would Serena do?\" Interviewed following her semi-final victory over Keys, Osaka commented on her thoughts during the match, \"I was just thinking that I really wanted to play Serena, because she is Serena,\" and when asked what her message to Serena would be, simply said, \"I love you.\"\n\nThe match began at 4:20 pm local time. Carlos Ramos of Portugal was the chair umpire for the match.\n\nThe first set passed by without any major incident, with Osaka breaking twice en route to winning it 6–2.\n\nWith Williams leading the second set, 1–0, 15-40, chair umpire Ramos gave Williams an official warning for alleged coaching, a code violation under International Tennis Federation rules. Television replays showed her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, gesturing to Serena with his hands and nodding, apparently signalling her to move forward towards the net. Mouratoglou admitted after the match that he did signal some form of coaching from the players' box, but of which he believed Williams was unaware. In response, Williams approached Ramos and told him, \"If he's giving me a thumbs up, he's telling me to come on. We don't have any code, and I know you don't know that, and I understand why you thought that was coaching but I'm telling you it's not. I don't cheat to win. I'd rather lose. I'm just letting you know.\" Osaka won the next point to level the second set, 1–1. During the following court change, leading 2-1, Williams brought up the matter again with Ramos, saying \"it's not something I would do but I could understand why you may have thought that but just know I've never cheated.\" Ramos assured Williams that he understood her, the on-court microphone picking him up telling Williams \"I understood your reaction as well\", which Williams thanked him for; however, the ruling was upheld.\n\nAfter breaking Osaka's serve for the first time in the match, Williams was serving at 3–1, at 30-15, however double faulted two points in a row to bring up break point, 30-40. Osaka broke back Williams' serve on the next point to bring the set back on serve, 3–2, as Williams hit the ball into the net on a backhand unforced error, turned to her box in frustration saying (according to on-court commentator Luke Jensen) \"I can't get over the top of the ball\", and smashed her racquet on the court. Ramos issued her a second code violation, this time for racquet abuse. As her second violation, she was penalised a point, and thus the next game started 15-0 to Osaka's advantage. Upon hearing of this, Williams raised the issue of her first code violation again with Ramos, insisting \"this is unbelievable. Every time I play here I have problems.\" Williams insisted that Ramos \"make an announcement that I didn't get coaching ... you owe me an apology, I have never cheated in my life!\" Invoking her recent pregnancy, she further remonstrated that \"I have a daughter and I stand for what is right for her\" and that \"you will never do another one of my matches.\" Osaka held serve the following game to level the set at 3–3, before breaking Williams' serve a second time in the set with a forehand winner to lead 4–3. \n\nAt the following change of ends, Williams continued to furiously berate Ramos, accusing him of attacking her character by insinuating that she cheated via being coached. She continued to demand an apology from Ramos, asserting to him that \"you will never, ever, ever, be on another court of mine as long as you live.\" The exchange culminated in Williams calling the umpire a \"liar\" and a \"thief\" for, as she perceived, unjustly \"stealing\" a point following the racket abuse incident. Ramos judged this to be a further code violation for verbal abuse; as the third code violation of the match against Williams, Osaka was awarded the next game by default, bringing the score to 5–3 and Osaka one game away from victory. Williams then demanded to speak to tournament referee Brian Earley and WTA supervisor Donna Kelso, to whom Williams indignantly claimed that such incidents have \"happened to me too many times\", she was being unfairly penalized because she was a woman, and that male players had \"do a lot worse\" without penalty, and that \"it happened to me at this tournament every single year\" (Williams had previously been subject to code violations on several occasions at the US Open, including in 2004 against Jennifer Capriati, 2009 against Kim Clijsters, and 2011 against Sam Stosur). Following this exchange, Williams held her serve to love (at 5–4), and continued to remonstrate with Kelso after the game. Osaka, however, held serve in the following game to win the set 6–4 and the match.\n\nUpon defeat, Williams embraced Osaka, but refused to shake Ramos' hand as per game etiquette, instead pointing at him and reasserting, \"You owe me an apology.\" As Ramos left the court, the crowd booed; Osaka, after greeting her team, did not acknowledge the crowd but immediately returned to her bench and hid her face with her towel.\n\nThe crowd continued booing as the trophy presentation commenced, interrupting both MC Tom Rinaldi and USTA president Katrina Adams several times. Ramos was not present to receive his token of appreciation as is normally the case in Grand Slam finals, and Osaka hid her face under her visor and wept as Williams consoled her. Upon accepting her runner-up plate, Williams, also in tears, attempted to stay positive and encourage the crowd by congratulating Osaka and pleading the crowd not to boo anymore, after which the crowd began to cheer. Upon receiving the trophy, Rinaldi asked Osaka for her thoughts on playing and defeating her idol. Osaka, still in tears, deferred from his question to address the crowd, saying, \"I know everyone was cheering for her and I'm sorry it had to end like this,\" before acknowledging her family, team, and Williams.\n\nWilliams, in her post-match press conference, raised the gender issue again, saying that the violations made her \"feel like it was a sexist remark\", reasserting that men have said worse things on court without violation, and drawing upon an earlier controversy in the tournament where Alizé Cornet was given a code violation for taking off her on-court (an action male players frequently do), as an example of double standards between men and women in tennis. She alluded to her actions being part of her role to stand up for women's rights and equality, and vowed to continue, a statement which drew both isolated applause and murmurs from the attendees.\n\nThe on-court incidents of the second set polarised opinions among current and retired tennis players worldwide. Chris Evert (whose Open Era record of 6 US Open women's singles titles Williams would have broken had Williams won), while commentating the match for ESPN, claimed that while first and second code violations were common for similar incidents, it was unprecedented to issue a third code violation (and therefore game penalty) for verbal abuse. Immediately following the match, interviewed while still in the player's box, Mouratoglou admitted to coaching Williams, but doubted whether Williams saw his gestures. Mouratoglou added that \"100% of coaches on 100% of matches\" still commit such actions, calling the response a \"hypocrite thing\" and the act of Williams breaking her racquet a normal human emotional reaction to the situation. Evert later agreed with Mouratoglou that \"every coach coaches\" despite it being a violation of rules, and with Williams' point that men have said worse things, including profanities (which Williams did not say), without penalty, but added that Williams' adamant insistence upon an apology aggravated the situation.\n\nBillie Jean King, former US Open Champion and founder of the Women's Tennis Association, was initially supportive of Williams, tweeting following the match: \"When a woman is emotional, she's 'hysterical' and she's penalised for it. When a man does the same, he's 'outspoken' and there are no repercussions. Thank you, Serena Williams, for calling out this double standard. More voices are needed to do the same.\" However, being interviewed by Christiane Amanpour three days later, King softened her criticism of the perceived double standard, admitting that Ramos did the right thing and could not apologise as Williams demanded in the situation, and placing some responsibility on Williams, saying that \"No one was saying she was a good sport, if they are they're crazy. She was totally out of line.\" King, however, agreed with Evert, that Ramos could have been less strict and given Williams a softer warning prior to any disciplinary actions. In an op-ed for \"The New York Times\", 4-time US Open champion Martina Navratilova claimed Williams' behaviour was not excused by the question of whether a male player would have avoided penalty, and added that while Mouratoglou was partly right in saying that coaching was widespread, so is the issuing of penalties for doing so.\n\nWorldwide opinion was divided following the match, with many branding Williams' behaviour \"embarrassing\" and \"ridiculous\", while others claimed she was a victim of blatant sexism. The decision to penalise Williams was also criticized by many, including 2003 men's champion Andy Roddick and two-time US Open finalist Victoria Azarenka, among others. Former world number one Ana Ivanovic, though, stayed away from the controversy, commending Osaka for her composed performance throughout the match while also praising Williams for being the champion she is.\n\nHowever, Williams also received support from WTA chief executive Steve Simon, as well as United States Tennis Association president Katrina Adams, who had been ridiculed for hailing Williams' \"class and sportsmanship\" during the post-match presentation.\n\nThe International Tennis Federation later issued a statement supporting Carlos Ramos' umpiring during the match, stating: \"Mr Ramos' decisions were in accordance with the relevant rules and were reaffirmed by the US Open’s decision to fine Serena Williams for the three offences. Mr Ramos acted at all times with professionalism and integrity.\"\n"}

One of the oldest videos of someone doing Acroyoga is with Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, practicing the role of the base, while a child executed some asanas in 1938. Since then, Acroyoga has gained new movements, and is still changing.\n\nThere are three primary roles in an Acroyoga practice: base, flyer, and spotter.\n\n\nis the physical part of Acroyoga that uses gymnastics techniques to build strength, flexibility, trust and teamwork between partners.\n\nIn the Acrobatic element we have:\n\nInitially basic poses such as bird, throne and whale. When the partners hold the position using equilibrium which is a state of rest or balance due to the equal action of opposing forces.\n\nFocus on movement - first, the flyer and base learn a static pose, later, how to move from one pose to another, creating a movement that is called \"transition\" in between the two poses.\n\nIn the acrobatic flying, there is a sequence of movements that start and end in the same position, which is called \"washing machine\". There are many different washing machines. These basics washing machines that are taught are: barrel roll and ninja star.\n\nSmall jumps where the partners keep physical contact with each other, usually keeping their hands connected.\n\nReflects the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines of traditional Yoga\n\nAt AcroYoga Inc this includes Thai massage, therapeutic flying and partner yoga.\n\nA basic therapeutic pose is \"Folded Leaf\" in which one partner is inverted and supported on the vertical legs of the other partner whose hands are then free for back massage.\n\nThe flyer relaxes the body and is guided by the base through some stretches and massage.\n\nTo help the flyer to relax, it is crucial to develop trust first, which can be done by practicing the acrobatic flying. Also, it is important that the base has a strong sense of responsibility, care and trust in all the movements that will execute, before start to heal flyers using therapeutic flying techniques.\n\nIt can use techniques from different types of massage, having as a result, a deep level of relaxation.\n\nLearning Acroyoga requires strength training, flexibility training and technique training. Strength training is accomplished through repetition of exercises like push-ups and hand walking. Flexibility training is best done at the end of a session with a partner. Learning good Acroyoga technique takes time and effort and is best learned with an expert teacher. One important Acroyoga technique is called \"stacking the bones.\" This involves the base partner keeping arms and legs straight to maximize the weight load on bones rather than muscles to support the flyer.\n\nA typical Acro Yoga session may include:\n\nSome communities have regular Acro Yoga meetings to provide a place for interested people to come together and practice for free. There are also larger Acro Yoga events such as the annual Divine Play in Portland, Oregon that draw practitioners from a regional or national area.\n\nIn the world, there are instructors teaching Acro Yoga in regular classes and workshops.\n\nYou can learn Acroyoga by yourself, but it takes time, discipline and responsibility, as you may not know all the techniques that will make the practice safe, for yourself and others.\n\nThere are many static acro yoga poses. A series of acro yoga poses that are repeated in a continuous flow is called a Washing Machine. \nIn late 2006, AcroYoga Inc. trademarked the word \"ACROYOGA\" and asserted that the word's first use anywhere was in 2005. However the term had been used since 1999 by Jessie Goldberg and Eugene Poku and their domain, acroyoga.com had been registered since 2005. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "28900922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28900922", "title": "Around the world cycling record", "text": "Around the world cycling record\n\nThe Guinness World Record (GWR) for fastest circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle is awarded for completing a continuous journey around the globe by bicycle and other means, consisting of a minimum 29,000 km in total distance cycled.\n\nIn 2013, GWR rules changed and the old record of 106 days 10 hours 33 minutes (22,997km/14,206 miles) set by Jay Aldous and Matt DeWall of SLC, Utah, USA in 1984 will now stand in GWR archives. The new rules now state that the journey should be continuous and in one direction (East to West or West to East), that the minimum distance ridden should be 18,000 miles (29,000 km), and that the total distance travelled by the bicycle and rider should exceed an Equator's length. The clock does not stop for any waiting time for transit flights or ferries or for the duration of the transit (see full rules below).\n\nThe male record is currently 78 days 14 hours, and 40 minutes by Mark Beaumont of Scotland. Jenny Graham of Scotland (member of the Adventure Syndicate) holds the current female record, completing her attempt in October 2018 in a total of 124 days. She cycled the route solo and totally unsupported often sleeping rough in drainage ditches or behind bushes. \n\nAlthough Guinness makes no differentiation, there are two types of attempts: supported and unsupported. Most cyclists choose to do the challenge supported, especially through the Australian outback. \n\nThe principles for unsupported rides are:\n\nThe rules state \"the journey should be continuous and in one direction (East to West or West to East), that the minimum distance ridden should be , and that the total distance travelled by the bicycle and rider should exceed an Equator's length, i.e. .\" They also state that: \"Any considerable distance travelled opposite to the direction of the attempt must be discounted from any calculations of the overall distance travelled,\" and that the route \"must be ridden through two approximate antipodal points.\"\n\nAlan Bate writes, \"The record criteria requires [sic] the rider to cover 28,970 kilometers by bike, in an East to West or West to East direction, wavering no more than 5 degrees off course. The total journey distance must be a minimum of 40,075 kilometers, to include all transit by flight or sea. The ride must start and finish in the same place and must pass at least two antipodal points (these are two points that line up through the earth's centre). When the rider reaches a transit point to connect with a flight or boat to the next continent or country start point, the clock stops with regard to the actual riding time *(no longer the case any more since the rules have changed in relation to transit time, which is NOW included in the total time). As most of the earth's surface is water, this is unavoidable and fair as it applies to all athletes attempting the record. Once customs is cleared at the next destination, the clock immediately starts again. The same bicycle must be used throughout the attempt, although repairs and replacement parts and bikes are allowed for mechanical failure. Satellite tracking is highly recommended by Guinness World Records and a daily log, signatures of dignitaries and photographs at strategic points must be collated as evidence.\"\n\nThe requirement to pass at least two antipodal points causes some problems in route planning. For example, among popular countries for around the world cyclists, the antipodes of Australia is spread out over the Atlantic Ocean, North America over the Indian Ocean, Africa over mid Pacific Ocean, and Europe and most of Asia over the South Pacific Ocean, without any land mass there. Those land areas would not give any opportunities for an antipodal pair while cycling. Some possible pairs are China / Argentina, Malaysia / Peru, and Spain / New Zealand (Madrid and Wellington fall within the ±5-degree difference permitted by Guinness).\n\nThe length requirement requires also consideration. To cycle Lisbon–Vladivostok (13900 km), Perth–Brisbane (4300 km) and Los Angeles–St. John's (7200 km) with air travel between legs gives 25,400 km. So some detours are needed (such as e.g Invercargill–Auckland, New Zealand, 1800 km, for the sake of the antipodes requirement).\n\nNick Sanders set the original record in 1981, riding around the Northern Hemisphere in 138 days. Sanders still holds the Guinness World Record for fastest ride around the coast of Great Britain, riding a verified in 22 days. In 2017 Mark Beaumont completed a route around the British coast in 14.5 days.\n\nFrom 2 April to 16 July 1984 Jay Aldous and Matt DeWaal rode 22,997km/14,290 miles in 106 days to break Nick Sanders record set in 1981. Aldous and DeWaal started and ended in Salt Lake City, USA and traveled in an easterly direction passing through 15 different countries. \n\nIn December 1993, Andrew Slodkowski completed a record riding ‘Around the World in 80 days on a bicycle’. Andrew started and ended in London UK, and traveled in an easterly direction passing through 14 different countries.\n\nOn 13 February 2005, Steve Strange completed the first record attempt under the new Guinness rules, achieving a world record of 276 days and 19 hours.\n\nIn April 2005, Phil White completed a record attempt in an estimated 299 days.

This beat his previous unsupported attempt by 115 days and beat the previous world record by 44 days and 10 hours and should be regarded as the record. This attempt was verified by Guinness World Records as he finished in Paris. The BBC reported, \"During the trip, Mark was also awarded the Guinness World Records title for the most miles cycled in a month, from Paris to Perth, Australia, verified at 7,031 miles (11,315km)\". Beaumont had significant support on his ride from a \"base camp\" team who stayed in Scotland, and \"on the road\" teams who followed in camper vans which provided him a comfortable place to rest when off the bike. The support team covered duties ranging from preparing his meals and ensuring optimum nutrition, optimising his route to avoid ratification pitfalls, providing massages to help alleviate the discomfort of spending long hours in the same position, and psychological support during low points.\n\nOn 18th October 2018 Jenny Graham arrived in Berlin having completed an unsupported circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle in 124 Days, 10 hours and 50 minutes (awating verification from Guinness World Records).\n\nOn 25 March 2017, John Whybrow and George Agate (known as 'The Tandem Men'), set the first tandem bicycle circumnavigation record. Starting and finishing in Canterbury, UK, the pair completed their attempt in 290 days, 7 hours and 36 minutes aboard an Orbit Tandem. This was an unsupported ride.\n\nThe \"Year Record\" was awarded for the longest distance cycled in a single year. It was awarded to Tommy Godwin, who held the record for 75 years, riding from 1939 to 1940. Godwin also set the record for fastest time to cycle (now held by Amanda Coker). The record was verified by Guinness World Records and recognised at the time by \"Cycling\" magazine.\n\nIn 2014, the UltraMarathon Cycling Association published a set of rules for a \"highest annual mileage record\", conceived as a continuation of Tommy Godwin's 1939-40 record. Three riders set out to break this record in 2015: Steven Abraham of the UK, Kurt Searvogel of the USA and William Pruett, also of the USA. Kurt Searvogel went on to break the record.\n\nIn 2016-2017 Amanda Coker set the world record by 86,573.2 miles.\n"}
{"id": "28885977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28885977", "title": "Australian rules football playing field", "text": "Australian rules football playing field\n\nAn Australian rules football playing field is a venue where Australian rules football is played.\n\nThe playing field is typically a large oval-shaped grass surface (often modified cricket fields). These fields may vary especially for variations of the game. However, for official Australian Football League matches, strict requirement specifications must be met for stadiums.\n\nAustralian rules football grounds, even at the highest level of the game, have no fixed dimensions. For senior football, the playing field is an oval, typically between 135–185 metres long goal-to-goal and 110–155 metres wide wing-to-wing. Grounds can vary from long and narrow to almost circular, and are not necessarily symmetrical, depending upon how and where the field was constructed. At least 5 metres of space between the boundary line and any fence is required for safety.\n\nSmaller fields are generally used for junior football; some are purpose-built, and some are temporarily marked out within the confines of full-sized oval; as for a senior match, there are no fixed dimensions for a junior-sized field. The Western Australian Football Commission advises that a good rule of thumb is to set the length of the field equivalent to 3½ times the length of an average kick of the age group playing.\n\nA top-level Australian rules football ground has the following markings:\n\nGrounds at lower or junior levels, particularly small grounds, may lack some of these markings.\n\nAt each end of the ground there are two goal posts, spaced 6.4m (7yds) apart; these are conventionally painted white. A further 6.4m (7yds) on either side of these are behind posts; the behind posts are shorter than the goal posts; additionally, in South Australia it is customary for behind posts to be painted red, 5 metres in height. All posts are typically padded with wall padding to minimise injury due to players colliding with them.\n\nPlaying surface is a controversial issue in Australian rules football due to possible injuries caused to players moving at high speed including marking, jumping, turning and being tackled without protective padding. For these reasons the playing field standards imply use of lawn as a surface.\n\nAlmost all Australian rules football fields are of a suitable size and shape for cricket; and in the majority of cases, the fields are used for cricket in the summer and Australian rules football in the winter, a seasonal strategy which is rooted in the history of Australian sport. As a consequence of this, there are very few fields which were purpose-built for and used by Australian rules football to the exclusion of cricket and all other sports.\n\nHowever, there are many grounds – particularly those built more recently – which were built with Australian rules football as the primary intended purpose, but upon which other sports, including cricket, have been played.\n\nVariations of the standard field dimensions and layout exist. For junior levels, smaller fields are often used. Rectangular fields have also been used in the past in Australia and also overseas, as well as adapted fields from other sports such as Association Football and American Football.\n"}
{"id": "525212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=525212", "title": "Bouncer (cricket)", "text": "Bouncer (cricket)\n\nIn the sport of cricket, a bouncer (or bumper) is a type of delivery, usually bowled by a fast bowler.\n\nBouncers are used to drive the batsman back on to his back foot if he has been freely playing front foot scoring shots, such as drives. To this end, bouncers are usually directed more or less at the line of the batsman's body. Aiming at the batsman is legal provided the ball bounces on the pitch; or upon reaching the batsman, the ball is below the batsman's waist. Aiming at the batsman's head without bouncing on the pitch, known as a beamer, is illegal.\nA batsman may play a bouncer in either a defensive or an attacking way. If the batsman plays it defensively he aims primarily to avoid getting out, and secondarily to avoid being hit by the ball. For a head-high bouncer, these goals are achieved most easily by ducking under the ball. If the ball is at chest height, the batsman's best defence is to move on to his back foot, raise his bat vertically to chest height, and attempt to block the ball and direct it downwards to the pitch so as to avoid presenting a catch to a fielder. Sometimes the batsman will need to jump into the air to gain the necessary height to defend with the bat. He may also sway out of the way. Given these approaches, the bowler can hope to both intimidate the batsman somewhat, and possibly have the ball deflect off the bat at an awkward angle and produce a catch for a nearby fielder. A bouncer ball is not valid if the ball is above the marks height before touching ground (the mark height is 8ft) that's mean when the bowler is bowling the ball the bowl should not exceed the 8 feet of height before touching ground, if it is above the mark level the ball will be declared No ball and the rule may change if the bowler height is above 6ft 5inch it will be increase 1/2 feet as height increase and the ball release as high intentionally it would be categorized as unfair delivery. That may be concern as objectionable delivery. The bowler that throw convective delivery as bouncer may lead to match fine or can be temporary ban for not obeying the cricket rule and tried to unfollow the rules. \nConversely, the bouncer can be a very productive ball for the batsman, if he plays it in an attacking manner. The shot that is used to attack the bouncer is the hook shot. To play the hook shot the batsman moves his back foot backwards and towards the off side as the ball is being delivered. As the ball approaches, the batsman swivels from facing the off side to facing the leg side, while holding the bat horizontally. The batsman's aim is to hit the ball at high speed towards, into or over the leg side boundary. However, despite their run-scoring potential, hook, shots frequently lead to wickets falling, particularly through balls hitting the top edge of the bat and being caught by leg side fielders. However, if the bouncer is misdirected by the bowler, and reaches the batsman on the off side of his wicket, the cut, uppercut or late cut can be played, either with the intention of guiding the ball along the ground, through a gap in the field setting, or over the infield for four or six.\n\nThere is an unspoken agreement, particularly in the time before the widespread use of batting helmets, that fast bowlers will not bowl bouncers at each other, because less skilled batsmen are less likely to effectively defend and therefore more likely to be struck. Breaking of this rule can lead to 'bouncer wars' – that is, the targeted bowler engaging in retaliatory hostile short-pitched bowling at his opponent during the following innings.\n\nBecause of the potential danger to batsmen of being hit and to stop bowlers bowling bouncers all the time, there are Laws in the Laws of Cricket governing how frequently a bowler may bowl bouncers, as well as how many fielders may field backward of square leg. These laws take into account the relative skill of the batsmen.\n\nDuring the 1970s to 1980s, bouncers were used as part of a team's intimidatory tactics, especially by the West Indies team. In 1991, the International Cricket Council (ICC) introduced a \"one bouncer per batsman per over\" rule in an attempt to discourage use of intimidation. However, the ruling was not well received by players and umpires alike, with English umpire Dickie Bird describing it as \"farcical\" as he felt that calling intimidatory tactics should be left to the umpire. The ICC changed it to two bouncers per over in 1994, with a two-run no-ball penalty (rather than one-run no-ball) if the bowler exceeded two bouncers an over. One Day International cricket allowed one bouncer per over in 2001 (and a one-run no-ball in case a bowler exceeded the limit).\n\nOn 29 October 2012 the ICC increased the number of bouncers that could be bowled during a One Day International to two. The number of bouncers per over allowed in T20s was kept to one.\n\nFast leg theory, the deliberate and sustained bowling of bouncers aimed at the body, coupled with a cordon of legside catching fieldsmen to catch deflections, was a tactic used by England against Australia in 1932/33, dubbed the Bodyline series by the Australians. This controversial tactic caused the Laws of Cricket to be reformed to prevent any recurrence. \n\nIn 1954–55 in Sydney, England fast bowler Frank Tyson bowled bouncers at Australian Ray Lindwall, who returned the favour by hospitalising Tyson with one of his own. An angry Tyson returned with a large lump on his head and took 6/85 in the second innings to give England a 38-run victory.\n\nIn 1994 at the Oval Devon Malcolm was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from Fanie de Villiers. The incensed Malcolm told the South Africans \"You guys are history\" and took apart their second innings with 9/57.\n\nThe bouncer is an aggressive delivery and the very nature of the delivery by a fast bowler and aimed at the head can lead to batsmen being hit in the chest, neck or head.\n\nIn 1962, Indian captain Nari Contractor was hit above his right ear by a Charlie Griffith bouncer which resulted in severe loss of blood and left Contractor critically ill. He regained full consciousness after six days and returned to first-class cricket ten months later. \n\nIn 2006, Australian opener Justin Langer, was struck on the head in his 100th Test from a bouncer from Makhaya Ntini and hospitalised. In 2008 West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul was knocked out for several minutes after being hit by a bouncer from Australian fast bowler Brett Lee during a test match. Shoaib Akhtar injured both Gary Kirsten (2003) and Brian Lara (2004) with fast bouncers. Both batsmen had to be taken off the field. \n\nIn November 2014, Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes was knocked unconscious by a bouncer from Sean Abbott, which hit the side of his head, between the grille and shell of his helmet, during a Sheffield Shield match. He was taken to hospital in a critical condition, suffering from a subarachnoid haemorrhage, but died from his injuries two days later, never having regained consciousness.\n\n"}

The Redcliffe Dolphins, who at the time were based at the Redcliffe Showgrounds, showed immediate interest and applied for the maximum area available. Redcliffe City Council engineer Kevin Tibbets took to the construction of the ground with the utmost enthusiasm, with the football club even hosting a trip interstate for him to study playing arenas in New South Wales.\n\nThe transition from the Redcliffe Showgrounds to Dolphin Oval presented some major problems. Due to the isolation of the area at the time of construction, normal services were not readily available and therefore had to be brought in. Due to the gravity flow to Klingner Road, expensive sewerage pumps had to be brought in, power for the floodlights had to go underground to the main oval and the run-through tunnel was transhipped from Western Australia at a cost of $9,000, which was still cheaper than buying one from the Eastern states.\n\nThe lighting at the showgrounds was far superior, but the Redcliffe Rugby League Old Boys, led by Neil Okamura, contributed a $5,000 loan, which was later turned into a grant, for suitable floodlighting. They also constructed a perimeter playing fence around the main oval at a cost of $2,780. In return, the football club provided the Old Boys with a solid can-booth at the northern end of the complex and were granted the rights to sell liquor on a commission basis.\n\nThe pressure to build a licensed club at Dolphin Oval was met with a great deal of caution, especially when the existing club at the Showgrounds was still profitable. But within 12 months after the sod-turning ceremony, the new clubhouse was opened by the Mayor of Redcliffe, Ald. Alf Charlish. With the help of the Federal Member for Petrie, Dean Wells, and his Government's contribution through their C.E.P. Funding, along with the football club's own financial arrangements with the Commonwealth Bank, the move was made possible.\n\nHowever the heavily publicised and enforced \"Don't Drink and Drive\" policy by the Government struck the thriving bar trade, and, according to \"From Shellgrit to Dolphins\", a book on the History of the Redcliffe Dolphins, says: \n\"Suffice to say the club only barely kept its doors open and its creditors at bay until the advent of poker machines in 1992, but proudly was able to meet its financial commitments\"\n\nIn January 1979, the committee proposed to name the complex the Don McLennan Oval, but Mr McLennan requested that it be called Dolphin Oval.\n\nFittingly, the first game at Dolphin Oval was between Redcliffe and Norths, the club that originally proposed Redcliffe's admission into the BRL. The original lease was acquired to 1998 and later extended to 2008, before the Redcliffe Dolphins bought the land.\n\nThe ground was redeveloped between 2015 and 2018 following announcement of the programme in 2014. After securing funding from Moreton Bay Regional Council and the Federal Government funding phase 1 of the redeveloped ground, now called Dolphin Stadium was opened. The second phase of work completed in February 2018.\n\n\n"}

As well as being viewed as the leader of the band, Hemmingham is also the managing director of them.\n\nAfter being offered a recording deal by Virgin Group chairman, Richard Branson, Hemmingham and the band released \"The Great Escape\" theme tune as singles for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. The England Supporters band then started received backing from commercial sponsors. In 2002, the band was sponsored by British newspaper, \"The Sun\" who paid for the band to fly to Japan for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In 2006, the band were sponsored by Leicester-based company Pukka Pies, becoming known as the Pukka Pies England Band.\n\nIn 2010 publishers, Peakpublish announced they had signed a deal with Hemmingham for him to write two books about the formation of the \"England Supporters Band\" and his experiences with them. The books were called \"The Story of the England Supporters' Band\" and \"Playing for England\".\n\nHemmingham has also led the \"England Band\" to other sporting events. In 2008, Hemmingham took the band to Beijing, China during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics to support Team GB however they were not permitted to enter the Beijing National Stadium with their instruments and instead played on the streets of Beijing. In 2012, during the London 2012 Summer Olympics it was announced that the \"England Band\" would be supporting both the Great Britain men's national field hockey team and the Great Britain women's national field hockey team during their matches at the Olympics. Hemmingham has also taken the band to Las Vegas, United States as well as the City of Manchester Stadium to support Manchester boxer, Ricky Hatton. They have also attended Rugby sevens matches to support the England national team.\n\nHemmingham first started in football administration as the chief executive of an independent supporters group called The Owls Trust, which he helped establish, in 2001. The Owls Trust was disliked by many Sheffield Wednesday fans and by Sheffield Wednesday chairman Dave Allen as it was perceived that it was a vehicle leading towards a takeover by Ken Bates, then chairman of Sheffield Wednesday's rivals Leeds United, as The Owls Trust controlled a large amount of shares and Hemmingham had publicly stated support for Bates.\n\nAfter an attempted boardroom coup by The Owls Trust to remove Allen from the chairmanship in an extraordinary general meeting in October 2004, in 2005, The Owls Trust were evicted from their offices at Hillsborough Stadium, Hemmingham was banned from executive areas of the stadium and The Kop Band was asked to reduce its numbers by Allen. Hemmingham's ban was then later extended to a full stadium ban from Hillsborough. As a result of this, after securing an area for matchday parking, Hemmingham resigned to take a full-time position at Bates' Leeds United as head of customer services and membership. This led to Hemmingham receiving death threats from Sheffield Wednesday fans.\n\nIn January 2008, Hemmingham left Leeds United and in August, he was appointed as the chief executive of non-league side, Mansfield Town where he oversaw the expansion of the capacity of their Field Mill stadium. However, in January 2009, he left his position after three months. Also in January, his relations with Sheffield Wednesday improved after Allen was no longer chairman and the new directors at the club, Lee Strafford and Nick Parker elected to remove Hemmingham's ban from Hillsborough. In 2011, Hemmingham rejoined Sheffield Wednesday as the Commercial Manager of Sheffield Wednesday Ladies.\n\nHemmingham has been married since 2007.\n\n"}

{"id": "50389650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50389650", "title": "Nike Hypervenom", "text": "Nike Hypervenom\n\nThe \"Nike Hypervenom\" is a football boot that is manufactured by Nike. This type of boot is said to be for traction, power, and agility, designed for deceptive players. Therefore, it is endorsed/worn by players, notably forwards, such as Robert Lewandowski, Kylian Mbappé, Harry Kane, Edinson Cavani, Gonzalo Higuaín, Marcus Rashford, Mauro Icardi, Riyad Mahrez, Aubameyang and Thiago.\n\nIn May 2013, the \"Nike Hypervenom Phantom\" was launched. It was launched and designed for Brazilian forward Neymar. The boot is currently in its third version. There is one high-end model for the first version, the \"Hypervenom Phantom\"; whereas, there are two high-end models for the second version—the \"Nike Hypervenom Phantom II\", which is a mid-cut variant and the \"Nike Hypervenom Phinish\", the low-cut variant. However, Nike chose to discontinue the Nike Hypervenom Phinish from the third silo onwards due to confusion that the mid-cut version was better than the low-cut. The mid-cut version will be called \"Hypervenom Phantom DF\".\n\nThe boot is available in Soft Ground (SG), Firm Ground (FG) or Artificial Ground (AG) versions in which all feature a glass nylon soleplate. There are also Turf (TF) and Indoor (IC) versions, in which the high-end model of these variants is the \"Nike HypervenomX Proximo\". The SG soleplate features 6 removable aluminium studs, in which different studs with different lengths can be used, and 6 fixed bladed studs. The FG version has 12 bladed and conical studs. The AG model contains many circular and hollow studs, meant to have more pressure distribution and trapping air to reduce impact and prevent injuries.\n\nThe \"Nike Hypervenom Phantom\" introduced several new features from other football boots at the time. It was made to replace the previous line, \"Nike Total 90 (T90)\", a line from Nike that has been around since 2000. This decision was met with mixed feelings, in which some say it is a good decision to replace the older line, and the others saying it was not a beneficial idea, as there were not many 'power' boots on the market. The \"Hypervenom\" was launched in May 2013, with the Barcelona player, at the time, Neymar, the main poster boy for this new line. The launch colourway was black/bright citrus. All boots were made in Soft Ground (SG), Firm Ground (FG) varieties, with the SG version using removable studs. The upper of the first boot has a newly developed material of \"NikeSkin.\"\n\nThe \"Hypervenom Phantom\" was released in May 2013. The boot was first known through a Nike commercial \"Nike Hypervenom - Deadly Breed\". Later on, more commercials will be made starring Neymar in which t\"he video is counting down to the released date of the Hypervenoms. The boot are advertised to be for \"fit, touch and traction\". The boots are originally released in the black/bright\" citrus colourway.\n\nThe \"Hypervenom Phantom\" features a \"NikeSkin\" upper, combining mesh webbing and thin layers of polyurethane to create a material that is soft and flexible, \"All-Conditions Control (ACC)\" for the same control for any condition, whether wet or dry. The upper of the \"Hypervenoms\" is honeycomed-like in design. It also feature a lightweight, perforated anatomical sockliner for low-profile cushioning and has a responsive glass nylon chassis with agility traction stud pattern for agility, comfort and durability. Those who use these boots have said that they are able to move freely with ease and felt comfortable in those boots. However, some argue that it lacks proper tightness that they encounter issues such as roll-over or heel slippage. There are also some who said that the boots are not durable and lasted quite a short time under frequent use.\n\nDuring the knockout stages of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, following a 4–1 win over Cameroon in which Neymar scored the tournament’s 100th goal, Nike commemorated this with a special edition pair of \"Gold/Volt/Black\" \"Hypervenom\" boots. This was also made because Neymar spray painted his football boots gold when he was 12 years old.\n\nIn early 2015, the \"Liquid Diamond Hypervenom\" was released. It was made to help Neymar \"stand out\" in a match, to describe Neymar's energetic style of playing and the feelings that Neymar had to his sister was \"rare, like diamonds\" as stated in a Nike commercial.\n\nIn mid-2015, the \"Hypervenom Phantom Transform SE\" was released. It features a special upper that changes from black to orange when heat is applied to it. This was the last edition of the \"Hypervenom Phantom I\".\n\nTwo years after the \"Hypervenom Phantom I\" was released, the new \"Hypervenom Phantom II\" and \"Hypervenom Phinish\" was released. This time, there were significant changes to the upper in terms of design and fit. The launch colourway is \"Wolf Grey/Total Orange/Black.\"\n\nThe \"Hypervenom Phantom II\" is a mid-cut boot due to the \"Nike Dynamic Fit Collar\" which is made out of \"Flyknit\" said to provide \"ankle support\". As before, it has an \"ACC upper\". It also features a different \"NikeSkin\" upper from the previous version. One of the difference was the use of Nike's \"Flywire\" technology to provide a lock-in and tightened feel for a cleaner strike.\n\nDue to the complaints about the new upper being too stiff, Nike opted to change the upper to the original ones on the Nike Hypervenom 1, effective 29 May 2016.\n\nIn February 2017, Nike introduced the next generation of Hypervenom shoes with the Nike Hypervenom III. Nike did away with the Phinish and renamed that shoe 'Nike Hypervenom Phantom'. The collared shoe that had previously been known as the Nike Hypervenom Phantom is now the 'Nike Hypervenom Phantom DF' with the DF standing for Dynamic Fit referring to the collar. Nike have made noticeable aesthetic and construction alterations that make the Phantom III a different experience from the Phantom II.\n\nAs the demand for urban football (street/cage football) is high, Nike created urban football boots using the same materials and/or design of their pitch football boots. The main difference in this line of Hypervenom is the use of gum rubber for the sole of the indoor and turf design.\n\nThe HypervenomX Proximo has exactly the same upper as the Hypervenom Phantom III. The only difference is use of a non-marking rubber sole for traction on indoor or turf courts and not including the PORON foam inserts\n\nThe HypervenomX Finale is the high-end low-cut model of the HypervenomX line. However, the upper is different compared to the upper used on the Hypervenom Phantom model. The upper is rather similar to the upper on the first version of the Hypervenom line, the Hypervenom Phantom 1. It also lacks ACC(All-Conditions Control).\n"}

It was part of the \"Parade\" All-American series that originated with boys basketball before branching to other sports. Started by the Sunday magazine in 1957, it had been the longest ongoing selection of high school basketball All-Americans in the country at the time of its final selections in 2015. Many of the honorees went on to star as college and professional basketball players. As of March 2011, there were 162 \"Parade\" All-Americans that were playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nAt its onset, the selections were handled by a New York-based public relations firm, Publicity Enterprises, which was led by Haskell Cohen, who was a former sportswriter as well as the publicity director for the NBA at the time (1950–1969). The first All-America team in 1957 consisted of three five-player teams, and the first-team selections appeared on television on \"The Steve Allen Show\". The following year, 20 players were selected and participated in the first annual \"Parade\" All-American high school game. The list later expanded to 40 of the nation's top players, divided into four teams of 10 each. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, known then as Lew Alcindor, became the first sophomore in 1963 to be named a \"Parade\" All-American. Earl Jones was the next to earn the distinction 15 years later as a sophomore, and subsequently joined Abdul-Jabbar as the first two players to be named to the first team on three occasions. \"It was a real thrill for me to make it on the \"Parade\" list early, when I was just a sophomore. The recognition is a great thing for kids to shoot for,\" said Abdul-Jabbar as part of the announcement for the 2000 team.\n\nStarting in 2011, the selections were compiled in conjunction with \"Sporting News\" and their writer, Brian McLaughlin. Candidates also began to be limited to players in their senior year. The selections went to a single-team format in 2012, and the size was reduced from 40- to a 20-player first team in 2014. McLaughlin described the selections as mostly Division I college-bound players that had a stellar senior year in high school. Additionally, \"Parade\" differentiated itself from most other All-American teams by not focusing solely on a player's standing among college recruiters. For example, some selectors might choose top recruits that had been injured much of their senior year. \"Parade\" discontinued its boys' basketball All-America selections after 2015.\n"}

{"id": "51083224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51083224", "title": "Turf (video game)", "text": "Turf (video game)\n\nTurf is a location based mobile game with MMO and augmented reality elements developed by Swedish video game developer Andrimon. It was released on 10 July 2010 for Android, and later for iOS. The game was originally created by Andreas Pantesjö and Simon Sikström, who still actively maintain and develop the game. The game has more than 150,000 registered players and is free to play. Players can pay a voluntary fee to receive \"supporter\" status, which gives access to additional in-app statistics, but comes with no gameplay benefits. The game has received media attention from Swedish, Finnish and Danish newspapers.\n\n\"Turf\" combines elements from traditional orienteering with elements commonly seen in many video games, such as a leveling system, leaderboards and achievements. The goal is to collect points by capturing virtual zones using the built-in GPS system of modern smartphones, and try to keep them for as long as possible to compete with other players. Zones are located all over the world, but with the highest concentration in countries with active competition, such as Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Zones are most commonly taken by foot or by bicycle, but occasionally zones are captured by other means, such as by boat and by car. \"Turf\" is by many players used as an exergame, a way of combining exercise with gaming. It has also been compared with augmented reality games \"Ingress\" and \"Pokémon Go\".\n\n\"Turf\" is played in rounds that each last for a month. Collected points by the player reset when a new round starts, as well as all ownership of the zones in the game. Total accumulated points by the player never reset after a round ends, as these are used to determine a player's rank as well as provide useful statistics for players to track their progress. At the end of a round the winner may choose to create a unique, custom zone anywhere, often referred to as a \"winner zone\".\n\nThere are special events arranged when players gather in a city to compete. A major annual event is called a \"Bonanza\", where participants gather in a city and run a standalone game session that lasts for a couple hours. Bonanzas are characterized by dense placement of zones in a game environment separate from the regular game to make the contest a standalone championship. The first Bonanza organized for Djurgården in Stockholm, Sweden, on 21 May 2011. In 2016, it was held in Kalmar.\n\nOther, smaller, events also occur that are similar to the major annual Bonanza event. They can be situated in different places with different orientations (canoe, only by foot, long seclusion etc.) In 19 June 2011, one of the first \"Turf\" events was at Dreamhack in Sweden.\n\nAn event can also be a closed event where only the invited have access, with small groups such as school physical education. In 2016, more than 300 physical education lessons consisted of \"orientation\" of the Turf.\n\n"}
