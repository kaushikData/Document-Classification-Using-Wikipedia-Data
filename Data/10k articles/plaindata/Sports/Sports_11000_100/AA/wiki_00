The official announcement for which one of these countries will host the Women's World Cup will not be made until early 2019. As of August 2018, Australia is the official bidder and five countries (Japan, Thailand, New Zealand, South Africa and Colombia) have expressed interest in hosting the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nIn 2017 it was first announced that the Australian Government was funding a feasibility study to host the 2023 Women's World Cup. Further funding was put into the bid in early 2018 by Federal Minister for Sport Bridget McKenzie as the government confirmed they were pledging an extra 4 million for it As at October 2018, a bid was being prepared by FFA. The bid was officially launched on 29 October 2018 with the campaign slogan \"#GetOnside\".\n\nJapan bid on 2023 tournament after declining their initial intention to bid on 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. Japan Football Association (JFA) Vice president Kozo Tashima says that the facilities will be renovated and ready for the World Cup. As of 2018, Japan is still in the running.\n\nIn 2015, Football Association of Thailand President Worawi Makudi announced Thailand's plans to consider bidding to host the 2023 tournament. However, Makudi has run into some legal trouble since his announcement which could jeopardize Thailand's chances of hosting the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. Makudi's legal troubles have not yet derailed the bid.\n\nPrior to their hosting of the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup, New Zealand officials expressed interest in bidding for the hosting rights of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.

{"id": "48528826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48528826", "title": "Bat flip", "text": "Bat flip\n\nIn baseball, a bat flip is the throwing of a baseball bat in such a way that it rotates several times before landing. It is typically done by a batter to show off after hitting a home run. This is in contrast to the usual practice of dropping the bat straight down as the batter begins running to first base.\n\nBat flipping is popular in Asian and Latin American baseball leagues. In South Korea, the bat flipping tradition dates back to the 1990s, and has become increasingly frequent in the Korea Baseball Organization. In the Korean language, bat flips are referred as \"ppa-dun\" (), a portmanteau of the \"first syllables of the words for 'bat' and 'throw'\". The practice is also common in Japan and Taiwan. \n\nIn the United States, bat flips have traditionally been considered rude and inconsistent with baseball etiquette. Traditional etiquette and the unwritten rules of baseball espouse humility and discourage actions which may be interpreted as arrogant or showing up the opponents. Torii Hunter, a retired Major League Baseball player and fan of bat flips in Korean baseball, has stated that a player throwing a bat in such a manner during a game in the United States would likely face retaliation in a subsequent at bat, such as being hit by a pitch. In April 2015, Los Angeles Dodgers right fielder Yasiel Puig stated that he would flip his bat less frequently because he wanted \"to show American baseball that [he's] not disrespecting the game.\"\n\nDuring the rubber match of the 2015 American League Division Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers at the Blue Jays' home stadium of the Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Blue Jays right fielder José Bautista executed what Andrew Keh of \"The New York Times\" described as possibly \"the most ostentatious bat flip in MLB history\" after hitting a go-ahead, three-run home run off Rangers relief pitcher Sam Dyson. Bautista wrote an article about the bat flip published in November 2015 in \"The Players' Tribune\". He said he \"didn’t plan it. It just happened\", and that he was \"caught up in the emotion of the moment\" when he flipped the bat. Bautista was criticized for the bat flip, which he attributed to a failure to understand differences in cultural backgrounds of players.\n\nMembers of the Rangers objected to the bat flip, with Rangers starting pitcher Derek Holland stating he did not object to a home run celebration, \"but the way he did it\". After the home run, Dyson approached Blue Jays designated hitter Edwin Encarnación, the next batter in the batting order, and \"told him that Jose needs to calm that down, respect the game more\". During the post-game press conference, Rangers manager Jeff Banister stated that \"we respect everybody\", which the media interpreted as a strong suggestion of disapproval of Bautista's actions.\n\nThe Bautista bat flip became an internet meme. Fans posted numerous responses to the event on Twitter, and shared videos on Vine and other social media websites and mobile apps. It was etched onto Jack-o'-lanterns for Halloween, printed on T-shirts and Christmas sweaters, and was also the subject of a thigh tattoo for an Oshawa, Ontario man. It was also commemorated on a Topps 2016 Series 1 baseball card. A corn maze in the Canadian province of New Brunswick was designed with the likeness of the Bautista bat flip.\n\nBautista's bat flip is added to \"NHL 17\", which is an official National Hockey League simulation video game, as a personal goal celebration, albeit with an ice hockey stick.\n\nHowever, Bautista's bat flip may be the impetus of the Jays–Rangers brawl on May 15, 2016 in the Rangers' home stadium of Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas, in which Rangers relief pitcher Matt Bush intentionally threw a pitch at Bautista, Bautista made an illegal slide to second base, and Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor punched Bautista in the face, thereby igniting the brawl. Bautista was suspended for one game for the incident, while Odor was suspended for eight.\n\nOn May 17, 2017 in the Atlanta Braves' home stadium of SunTrust Park in Cobb County, Georgia, Bautista did a bat flip on a home run in a five-run game that led to benches clearing. One day later, Braves starting pitcher Julio Teherán intentionally hit Bautista in the left thigh with a fastball, apparently as revenge. The next three batters had consecutive hits, allowing Bautista and a few other runners to score.\n"}

Russian referee Valentin Ivanov issued a FIFA World Cup record four red cards and 16 yellow cards, setting a new record for cards shown at any FIFA-administered international tournament.\n\nPortugal and the Netherlands had met at the semi-final stage of the previous major tournament, UEFA Euro 2004 held in Portugal, which had finished 2–1 to the host nation, but had not featured the same level of animosity between the players. A total of five Dutch and eleven Portuguese players who took some part in that fixture were also on the field in Nuremberg.\n\nThe match ended 1–0 to Portugal, with Maniche scoring in the 23rd minute; he had also scored the winning goal in 2004. Mark van Bommel was booked in the second minute, and also before the goal Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz was booked for a foul which injured Cristiano Ronaldo and would eventually force the substitution of Portugal's star winger before half time. Ronaldo left in tears, and proceeded to describe Boulahrouz's tackle as \"clearly an intentional foul to get me injured.\" In the meantime, Maniche had been booked for a foul on Van Bommel after 19 minutes.\n\nShortly after the goal, Portugal's defensive midfielder Costinha slid into Dutch veteran Philip Cocu, receiving a yellow card. He was then the first to be sent off just before half time after being shown a second yellow card for a handball. After Petit had been cautioned in the 50th minute, Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Luís Figo both received yellow cards, with Figo's coming as a result of a touchline melee with Mark Van Bommel during which Figo headbutted him. Portugal manager Luiz Felipe Scolari controversially gave his approval to this headbutt by stating after the match, \"Jesus Christ may be able to turn the other cheek but Luís Figo isn't Jesus Christ.\" Scolari also escaped punishment.\n\nBoulahrouz was sent off in the 63rd minute with a second caution after fouling Figo, which sparked a melee on the touch-line, involving Boulahrouz (who confronted Simão), André Ooijer and the Portuguese bench, necessitating the intervention of the fourth official Marco Rodríguez. Portugal's playmaker Deco roughly fouled Dutch defender John Heitinga and was booked; the Netherlands had not given the ball back after Portugal had cleared it into touch to allow a player to receive medical treatment, thus breaking one of football's unwritten rules. In the ensuing brawl, Wesley Sneijder pushed Petit to the ground and was also cautioned. The Netherlands' Rafael van der Vaart received a yellow card, apparently for dissent.\n\nAfter that, Portugal's goalkeeper Ricardo (presumably for time wasting) and left-back Nuno Valente (for a rough foul) were punished. Deco received his second caution and was dismissed in the 78th minute for delaying the restart after a free-kick was awarded. Cocu escaped a caution for wrestling Deco to the ground in his attempt to retrieve the ball. In the 88th minute, Simão drew the ire of the Dutch goalie Edwin van der Sar after the Portuguese player's leg made contact with the custodian in his attempt to score a goal, but the referee decided against taking any disciplinary action. In injury time, Van Bronckhorst was sent off for a second yellow card for a foul on Tiago.\n\nA scene was shown on television footage during the match in which Boulahrouz, Deco, and Van Bronckhorst were sitting together on the sidelines after being sent off, the latter two having a discussion, both being teammates at FC Barcelona. Commentator Gary Bloom referred to the scene as the \"Bad boys' corner\".\n\nIn the aftermath of the match, referee Ivanov was criticised by FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who suggested that Ivanov should have given himself a yellow card for his poor performance during the match. Blatter later regretted these words and promised to apologise officially.\n\nWhen Portugal faced England in the subsequent quarter-final, they were without the suspended Deco and Costinha. Portugal managed to reach the semi-finals. However, they had two players suspended for that match due to accumulated yellow cards (including the ones against the Netherlands).\n\n\n\nurl=\n"}

Opened in June 1973, its current seating capacity is 11,671 for basketball. It is the home venue for both the Cougars men's and women's basketball teams of the Pac-12 Conference.\n\nThe arena was renamed in 1981 for Wallis Beasley (1915–2008), a long-time sociology professor and executive vice shortly before his retirement from the university. He was WSU's faculty representative for athletics in the 1960s and also served as interim university For its first eight years, the venue was known as \n\nThe building used \"space frame\" construction, relatively novel at the time. The elevation of the court is approximately above sea level.\n\nThe building's inaugural event in 1973 was the university's commencement exercises on Its first sporting event was an NBA exhibition game between Seattle and Portland on September 25, 1973.\n\nThe first collegiate sporting event was a men's varsity basketball game against LSU on December 1, immediately preceded by a freshman game. Intercollegiate basketball was formerly played in Bohler Gymnasium, which opened in 1928 and is now home to Cougar volleyball.\n\nLocated on the east side of campus, the building includes Friel Court, the name of the basketball playing surface. It honors the longtime head coach of the WSU men's basketball team, who led the Cougars to 495 victories in thirty seasons.\n\nFriel stepped down as head coach in 1958 and five years later became the first commissioner of the Big Sky Conference, originally based in Pullman (from 1963 to 1971), because that's where he lived. The court was named for Friel in late April 1977, announced by President Glenn Terrell at a meeting of the board \n\nThe court surface was tartan (polyurethane) for its first decade; a traditional hardwood floor debuted in the fall \n\nThe Coliseum has hosted the sub-regionals of the NCAA men's basketball tournament three times: 1975, 1982, and 1984.\n\nThe 1975 tournament had 32 teams and the sub-regional had just two games: Big Sky champion Montana and second-ranked UCLA advanced on Saturday night before 10,500. Pac-8 champion UCLA trailed Big Ten runner-up Michigan by four at halftime and needed overtime to win In the opener, WSU alumnus Jud Heathcote's Montana beat independent Utah State Five days later in the Sweet Sixteen in Portland, UCLA defeated the Grizzlies by a mere the Bruins continued on and won a tenth national title in twelve seasons, and hall of fame head coach John Wooden retired.\n\nBy 1982, the tournament had 48 teams and its Pullman sub-regional had four games with six teams, headlined by the Northwest's top two teams, fourth-ranked Oregon State and #8 Idaho Both were seeded with first-round byes and advanced: Oregon State dispatched Pepperdine and Palouse neighbor Idaho outlasted Iowa in overtime to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, with 12,340 in attendance on Sunday The next week in Provo, Utah, OSU eliminated Idaho, then was defeated by Georgetown, the eventual runner-up.\n\nThe 1984 tournament had 53 teams and six played in Pullman on the new hardwood.

The building may be reconfigured for seating capacities of 12,000 in the round to 9,000 in an end-stage configuration for concerts, to 2,500 in a theater configuration using an extensive system of fly-in curtains, an adjustable cloth scrim ceiling, and a portable proscenium stored under the floor.\n\nThe original opera house/theater configuration featured one of the first synthesized acoustical environments using surround speaker systems. An onsite reverberation chamber tuned with fiberglass panels for the specific acoustical configuration was combined with the first commercial use of a digital delay line, the Lexicon DD1, then fed to the side and overhead speakers. When properly set up, it was capable producing a very convincing acoustical rendition of a theater, an opera house, or by changing the delay settings and retuning the reverb chamber, even a cathedral. Unfortunately, a sewer drain line had been installed from the southeast corner restroom facilities through the reverb chamber, and if a toilet flushed when the system was in operation, the resulting sound effect was extraordinary. After discovering that, locking the restroom was a management priority whenever the theater was prepared for surround sound use. More recently full digital reverberation replaced the chamber.\n\nThe Coliseum's Hall of Fame—famous entertainers who have performed there—include comedians such as Bob Hope, Bill Cosby, Jay Leno and Whoopi Goldberg and musical stars or shows such as The Beach Boys, The 5th Dimension, Tony Orlando and Dawn, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Elton John, Def Leppard, Metallica, Metal Church, Van Halen, Dana Carvey, Drew Carey, Montgomery Gentry, Bill Engvall, Howie Mandel, Grease & Cats. The Harlem Globetrotters have performed there five times.\n\nThe Coliseum has been the venue, for many years, for the Great Performances series, organized by Festival Dance and Performing Arts Association, of neighboring Moscow, Idaho.\n\nOverflow crowds attended lectures by Noam Chomsky on April 22, 2005, and by Jane Goodall on March 8, 2007.\n\nOn March 6, 2010, the arena hosted a WWE SmackDown house show.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21021878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21021878", "title": "Breakaway rim", "text": "Breakaway rim\n\nA breakaway rim is a basketball rim that contains a hinge and a spring at the point where it attaches to the backboard so that it can bend downward when a player dunks a basketball, and then quickly snaps back into a horizontal position when the player releases it. It allows players to dunk the ball without shattering the backboard, and it reduces the possibility of wrist injuries. Breakaway rims were invented in the mid-1970s and are now an essential element of high-level basketball.\n\nIn the early days of basketball, dunking was considered ungentlemanly, and was rarely used outside of practice or warm-up drills. A broken backboard or distorted rim could delay a game for hours. During the 1970s, however, players like Julius Erving and David Thompson of the American Basketball Association popularized the dunk with their athletic flights to the basket, increasing the demand for flexible rims. \n\nWhile several men claim to have created the breakaway rim, Arthur Ehrat is recognized as the inventor by the Smithsonian Institution's Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention & Innovation. A resident of Lowder, Illinois, Ehrat worked at a grain elevator for most of his life and barely knew anything about basketball. In 1975, his nephew, an assistant basketball coach at Saint Louis University, asked him to help design a rim that could support slam dunks. Using a spring from a John Deere cultivator, Ehrat designed a rim that could bend and spring back after 125 pounds of force were applied to it. He called his device \"The Rebounder\". In 1982, he was awarded a patent for his invention, which was officially called a \"deformation-preventing swingable mount for basketball goals\". \n\nThe breakaway rim was first used by the NCAA during the 1978 Final Four in St. Louis. Although Darryl Dawkins notoriously shattered two backboards with his dunks in 1979, the old-style bolted rim structure was not phased out of the NBA until the 1981–82 season, when breakaway rims debuted as a uniform equipment upgrade.\n"}

Most employ a single period in which the main league competition is contested alongside any cup competitions, although many Latin American leagues have two competitions contested in one season under the Apertura and Clausura system.\n\nAs a rule, the period of the domestic football season is ultimately dictated by the weather, with most football games played on natural grass pitches which are vulnerable to freezing or becoming water-logged, although advances in artificial turf and pitch drainage/heating systems have improved pitch availability in many leagues.\n\nIn countries where association football competes with other football codes that are locally more popular, the season cycle can also be dictated by the scheduling of competing codes. Major League Soccer (MLS), which began in the United States and has since expanded into Canada, has had to compete with American football from its inception, and now competes with Canadian football as well. When MLS began, most of its teams had to play in large American football stadiums that were used by teams in the NFL or college football. This led to scheduling the season to begin in spring and end in fall (autumn), which put the bulk of the season outside that of American football. Stadium conflict has now been reduced with the advent of soccer-specific stadiums. In Australia, the two most popular football codes are Australian rules football and rugby league, both of which are traditionally played in the Southern Hemisphere winter. Because all of the stadiums used by the A-League are also used for one or both of these two codes, that league chose to operate on a spring-to-autumn cycle, which placed most of its season outside those of Australian rules and rugby league.\n\nThe domestic season is preceded by a pre-season, in which clubs will require players to report back to the club by a set date to begin pre-season training, and will arrange pre-season friendly games toward the start of the season to improve fitness and test team formations and tactics, particularly if new playing staff have joined a club.\n\nIn many leagues, the dates of the domestic season dictate the opening and closing of a transfer window, the periods when players can be transferred.\n\nThe timing of a domestic season must be coordinated with international football competitions, which can see national teams with different domestic seasons playing each other at different times in their domestic season, although this can be less significant for certain countries where their best players, and hence the bulk of their national team, do not play in their international team's domestic league programme.\n\nThe world football governing body, FIFA, which governs club as well as national football, mandates an international football calendar, whereby certain weeks in the year are reserved for national friendly and competitive matches, as well as regional club competitions. For dates which fall within a country's domestic season, league clubs are required to release any called up player for their international team a set number of days before a fixture. The date of the worldwide national team competition the FIFA World Cup is always in June/July, with the exception of the 2022 Qatar World Cup which will be played in November/December.\n\nWhen not specified, winter breaks are around the Christmas and New Year weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In basic terms, a fly is a tent without walls. Purpose-made stand-alone flies are also sometimes referred to as bivouacs, bivvies, tarpaulins, or hootchies. Flies are generally used for keeping moisture (such as condensation or rain) or sun off people while they eat, rest or sleep. They can also be used as groundsheets, but this is not recommended since it creates wear and tear which can lead to holes.\n\nA stand-alone fly is a multi-purpose tool and is very flexible. For example, a fly can be put up in a wide variety of shapes depending on the environment and the weather, whereas a tent usually has a pre-set configuration for its structure which can be adjusted somewhat but not substantially. A fly also has the advantage of being particularly light and portable. \n\nDisadvantages of flies include that a person is still exposed to the elements such as mosquitoes and cold weather and that it can be difficult to put a fly up if there are limited natural vertical structures such as trees in the camping area. Flies, however, can be put up using poles or jury-rigged, for example, using paddles.\n\nA fly is also used to create shade as in the desert. Then a traditional tent is erected under the fly.\n\n\n"}

It was coproduced by Alliance Atlantis and the National Film Board of Canada.\n\nKasparov had beaten Deep Blue, a computer designed specifically to beat him, in a match played in 1996. He agreed to offer a rematch the following year. Kasparov won the first game of the rematch easily with the white pieces. In the second game, Kasparov was struggling with the black pieces, but set a trap that most computers fall for. Deep Blue didn't fall for it and won to level the match. At the time it was reported that both Kasparov and Deep Blue missed a perpetual check that could have given Kasparov a draw, but the strongest computer chess engines today, for example Stockfish, don't consider the final position as draw, but as having better winning chances for white, contradicting the human analysis at the time that Kasparov missed an opportunity to enter into a perpetual check. The next three matches ended in draws, with Kasparov appearing to weaken psychologically. Deep Blue went on to win the decisive sixth game, marking the first time in history that a computer defeated the World Champion in a match of several games.\n\nFrom this experience, particularly the second game of the match, Kasparov accused the IBM team of cheating. He suspected that a human player was used during the games to improve the strategic strength of the computer. As a metaphor for this suspicion, the film weaves in the story of the Turk, a hoax involving a chess-playing automaton built in the eighteenth century, but secretly operated by human beings. The film also implies that Deep Blue's heavily promoted victory was a plot by IBM to boost the company's market value.\n\n\"Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine\" received mixed reviews from critics. Among the positive reviews, Lou Lumenick of the \"New York Post\" called \"Game Over\" a \"solid documentary\" that is \"fairly suspenseful\". Dennis Lim of the \"Village Voice\" called \"Game Over\" a \"gripping documentary\". Jami Bernard of the \"New York Daily News\" called it \"a nail-biter\".\n\nPeter Hartlaub of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", however, called \"Game Over\" \"a film with one big question and no visible attempt to find any answers.\" Numerous reviewers criticized \"Game Over\" for being biased toward Kasparov and making accusations against IBM without presenting evidence for its claims, including Robert Koehler of \"Variety\", Kevin Crust of \"The Los Angeles Times\", Michael Booth of \"The Denver Post\", Liam Lacey of \"The Globe and Mail\", Janice Page of \"The Boston Globe\", and Ned Martel of The New York Times\n\nThe film was nominated for a 2003 International Documentary Association award.\n\n\n"}

It is located on the Busch Campus at Rutgers, and overlooks the Raritan River to the South. The stadium was opened as \"Rutgers Stadium\" on September 3, 1994, when the Rutgers Scarlet Knights hosted the Kent State University Golden Flashes. It currently seats 52,454 spectators after a 2009 expansion.\n\nHighPoint.com underwent significant reconstruction from 2008 to 2009 to increase its capacity to 52,454. The stadium features two 5,000-seat upper decks on each side of the playing field, as well as 968 loge and club seats on the mezzanine level of the East side of the stadium. A two-story press box sits on the mezzanine level of the West side of the stadium. Electronic ribbon scoreboards spanning the length of the field along the bottom of both upper decks were installed prior to the 2008 season, which complement the video scoreboard in the South end zone. Also located in the South end zone is the Brown Football Recruiting Pavilion and Welcome Center, part of the 2008–2009 expansion project.\n\nThe stadium also features light stanchions that allow for night games, a cannon for firing when Rutgers scores, concessions, and restrooms. Until 2004, the field maintained a grass surface, but has since been replaced with Field Turf.\n\nThe first intercollegiate football game, in which Rutgers beat Princeton 6–4 on November 6, 1869, was played at College Field, which is now the location of the College Avenue Gymnasium and its parking lot. From 1891 to 1938, the Rutgers football team played at Neilson Field on the College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\nWith the aid of grants from the Works Progress Administration, and after three years of construction, the original Rutgers Stadium was completed in 1938. The first game in the new stadium was against Hampden-Sydney in front of an estimated crowd of about 10,000 persons. Rutgers was victorious in the contest, defeating Hampden-Sydney 32–0. The stadium was dedicated on November 5, 1938 in a game against Princeton. Rutgers would go on to win the game 20-18. It was the first time Rutgers had defeated Princeton since the first ever intercollegiate football game in 1869.\n\nOn September 27, 1969, Rutgers and Princeton met for The Centennial Game at old Rutgers Stadium, which was played in front of 31,000 fans. Rutgers would win 29-0, their 10th win in 60 tries against the Tigers.\n\nThe current stadium was built on the site of the original old Rutgers Stadium. During the construction of the current stadium, the Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team played the 1993 season at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, a facility operated by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA). The NJSEA financed the construction of the stadium via the issuance of bonds. The Scarlet Knights had previously played several games at Giants Stadium, including the first college football game hosted at that venue: a 47-0 victory over Columbia University on October 23, 1976.\n\nThe new Rutgers Stadium was originally constructed to accommodate 41,500 fans at its maximum capacity and was officially opened on September 3, 1994, in a game against Kent State University. Light stanchions were integrated into the design so night games could be played. A two-story press box that fits 200 reporters was also constructed and is still in use today. A free-standing scoreboard was built near the south end zone, which did not originally contain any seating areas. The original design of the stadium replicated the shape of a horseshoe, with the \"open\" end located near the south end zone.\n\nHeralded by many newspapers, sports writers, and Rutgers fans as the \"most important game in Rutgers history\", on November 9, 2006, a then record crowd of 44,111 attended a football game between the Scarlet Knights and the Louisville Cardinals at Rutgers Stadium. The Scarlet Knights were ranked #15 and the Louisville Cardinals #3 in the nation in the Associated Press poll at the time. The game drew the ESPN's third-largest TV audience for a college football game up to that point in time. The official attendance exceeded the normal maximum capacity of the stadium due to the temporary addition of bleachers in the South end zone of the stadium. The bleachers were used to seat additional students.\n\nIn January 2008, the Board of Governors of Rutgers University announced a $102 million stadium expansion project in order to increase the stadium's seating capacity to nearly 56,000. However, the scale of the project was slightly reduced due to a poor economy and financial difficulties, resulting in a new maximum capacity of precisely 52,454.\n\nThe first phase of the project, which included the addition 968 club seats and related infrastructure to the East mezzanine level of the stadium, was completed on time and within budget for the 2008 football season. The second phase included the addition of approximately 11,500 seats to the previously \"open\" South end zone, as well as supplementary restrooms and concession stands to the southern end of the stadium. The second phase of the project also involved the addition of a large scoreboard in the South end zone, which is 38' tall by 112' wide, for a total surface area of 4,256 sq ft. The old scoreboard (since demolished) was 22' tall by 30' wide, for a total surface area of . The sound system was also enhanced as a part of the second phase of the expansion.\n\nIn addition to adding seats, concession stands, and bathrooms to the south end zone, the stadium expansion project called for a new entrance off River Road. The facade of the entrance is adorned with brownstone, and as of May 2, 2010, was not fully completed.\n\nOn July 14, 2009, the Rutgers Board of Governors unanimously approved a $5 million donation specifically appropriated for a recruiting lounge in the newly expanded end zone. The lounge had been included in the original expansion design, but was later deferred after the Board of Governors revised the expansion financing plan. The donation was provided by two Rutgers alumni. The lounge was named after one of the donors, Greg Brown, who is the President and Co-CEO of Motorola. The second donor requested anonymity. Construction on the lounge commenced in August 2009, and was completed in December of that same year.\n\nThe facility seats approximately 300 people and serves as a multi-purpose center for the university. The pavilion hosts and accommodates recruits around the year and also holds fundraising events for potential donors. The center is also used during tours for prospective students.\n\nThe $102 million price tag of the expansion project was to originally be financed via private fundraising ($30 million) and the issuance of bonds ($72 million). The private fundraising effort, however, fell significantly short of the original goal.\n\nThis situation prompted the Board of Governors of Rutgers University to approve a new financing plan for the stadium expansion in which the entire amount of $102 million was to be borrowed. Specifically, the university issued $85 million in bonds, and borrowed the remaining $17 million by way of low-interest commercial paper. In addition, a few aspects of the stadium expansion project were scaled back, including a reduction in the number of new seats (the original plan called for 14,000 seats, but only 11,500 were actually added). Also included in the original expansion plan was the construction of new locker rooms in the South end zone. The construction of these locker rooms was deferred to a later date.\n\nFor decades, \"Rutgers Stadium\" had been the name of the school's football facility. However, in June 2010, Rutgers University put up for sale the naming rights to the stadium in order to bring in much needed revenue. Rutgers hired Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment and IMG College to act as agents in making a deal, who had previously negotiated deals on the now-Brooklyn Nets' home arenas in New Jersey and New York. On June 22, 2011, it was announced that High Point Solutions, based in Sparta, New Jersey, had purchased the rights, and that the stadium would be known as High Point Solutions Stadium. In May 2018, High Point Solutions announced they were rebranding the company to just be HighPoint.com. As a result, the name of the stadium was changed to HighPoint.com Stadium.\n\nThe stadium attendance records were repeatedly broken throughout the 2006 and 2007 football seasons as the football program experienced a drastic resurgence. On October 18, 2007, a record 44,267 spectators attended a game in which the Scarlet Knights played against the then #2 ranked South Florida Bulls. The Scarlet Knights would go on to win that game, and the attendance on that night would be the highest ever prior to the 2008–2009 stadium expansion.\n\nThe new record was set in the 2014 Big Ten Conference opener against the Penn State, when 53,774 people packed the venue to witness the first game in Big Ten Conference play after transferring from the American Athletic Conference before the 2014 season. This record still stands today. The top 5 games in terms of attendance at Rutgers Stadium are listed below:\n\nIn addition to football, HighPoint.com Stadium has been the home of Rutgers' men's and women's lacrosse teams since 2014.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted NCAA tournament soccer and lacrosse games, including the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship games in 1998, 2001, and 2002. It is also worth noting that, prior to 1994, the original Rutgers Stadium hosted the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship games in 1974, 1978, 1983, 1987, and 1990.\n\nOn September 25, 2005, Rutgers Stadium was the site of a lecture delivered by the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe stadium was a host venue for the 1995 U.S. Cup soccer tournament and hosted Colombia vs. Nigeria on June 17, 1995 and the United States vs. Colombia on June 25, 1995.\n\nEvery first weekend in December, Rutgers Stadium plays hosts to several championship games in the NJSIAA state football playoffs. The stadium is one of two venues that hosts multiple championship games in one weekend (MetLife Stadium is the other). However, unlike MetLife Stadium that hosts games on Friday nights and Saturday afternoons, Rutgers hosts games on Sundays in addition to its Friday and Saturday games (MetLife Stadium is unavailable for Sunday games due to its NFL commitments).\n\nEvery year in October, Rutgers Stadium hosts USBands Marching Band New Jersey State Championships.\n\nSince 2011, University Commencement has been held in HighPoint.com Stadium each May. On May 15, 2016, President Obama addressed the class of 2016 and received an honorary degree of laws. Over 50,000 guests and graduates attended this historic day to celebrate the 250th Anniversary Commencement.\n\n"}

The stadium is primarily used for rugby league and secondary used for the A-League, and is one of the home grounds of the National Rugby League (NRL) team St. George Illawarra Dragons. The stadium has hosted soccer matches, including hosting Sydney Olympic FC in the National Soccer League (2003-04 season) and currently Sydney FC in the A-league (2018-19 season).\n\nThe ground hosted its first game of rugby league in March 1936 when the St. George Dragons were defeated by the Newtown Bluebags in an exhibition match. The stadium has undergone several constructions over the years and one is still being planned for the foreseeable future. The first official game was played on 22 April 1950 in which the Dragons lost 17-15 to South Sydney.\n\nMapping software & websites when asked to find Kogarah Oval, Jubilee Stadium or Oval, often confuse the stadium with the Jubilee Park Oval located in Glebe, New South Wales on the Rozelle Bay foreshore.\n\nJubilee Stadium currently stands on part of the original grant of awarded on 23 December 1853 to Archibald McNab. Edmund English purchased the grant on 23 May 1854 for around 400 pounds. It officially became known as Kogarah Park when it was acquired by the Department of Lands on 1 July 1896 and dedicated as the first public park in Kogarah. Control of the park was eventually passed to the Council of the Municipality of Kogarah on 29 August 1906.\n\nDuring Kogarah’s Jubilee celebrations in 1935, Jubilee Stadium was constructed in Kogarah Park.\n\nThe ground was closed from 1986 until the end of 1988 because of the construction of the new grandstand being built on the western side of the ground. During this time the Dragons played their home games at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1986 and 1987, while using Belmore Oval, the home of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, in 1988.\n\nSince 2003, Jubilee Stadium has been steadily upgraded in a three-stage plan, funded by the NSW State Government and Federal Government. In 2006, the ground had been updated with new features to the seating around the grandstand and features directly out of the stadium including re-developments to the Hall of Fame walk and Kogarah Park in front of the stadium. Stage 1 consisted of new terraced seating at the north-western end, perimeter seating at the base of the hill, and a regrassed and raised hill area. Floodlights for televising night matches were also installed.\n\nIn 2007, the Dragons announced that they would not be playing home games at Kogarah for the 2008 season so that Stage 2 redevelopment of the ground could be completed with new roofed extension on the Southern side of the main grandstand increasing capacity by around 2000, and further upgrading to the hill area, including turnstile facilities and strengthening the retaining wall at the Southern Jubilee Avenue end. The Dragons returned for 2009 against the Sharks in round 3, and broke the club record for highest Crowd at the ground.\n\nIn 2010, the Dragons secured $13m from the NSW State Government to complete the Stage 3 Northern grandstand extension, with an additional 1580 seats and the replacement of 1730 seats in the existing main grandstand. Also included in the development are additional public toilets and facilities, refurbishment of the existing grandstand facilities including the team change rooms, a new passenger and service lift, additional corporate and multi purpose facilities, and a museum and merchandise store.\n\nA new digital scoreboard and several satellite scoreboards, new security system, turnstiles and ticketing facilities at Gate B and a rainwater harvesting tank were also installed around the ground during 2010 and 2011. \n\nIn March 2004 a Legends Walk at Kogarah Oval was opened, with 16 club greats inducted into a hall of fame.\n\nBrian `Poppa` Clay • Mark Coyne • Reg Gasnier • Ken Kearney • Johnny King • Graeme Langlands • Eddie Lumsden • Matt McCoy • Noel Pidding • Norm Provan • John Raper • Rod `Rocket` Reddy • Kevin Ryan • Billy Smith • Ian Walsh • Billy Wilson • Craig Young • Robert Stone\n\nFrom 1950 until 2003, the ground was simply known as Jubilee Oval.\n\nIn 2003, printing and data communications company OKI signed a five-year sponsorship deal for naming rights to the ground with the name becoming OKI Jubilee Stadium. In October, 2008, OKI Printing Solutions decided not to renew the naming rights of Jubilee Oval, as the Dragons played at ANZ Stadium during the 2008 season due to re-developments at Jubilee. The naming rights ended on 31 October with the park reverting to its former name.\nIt was officially announced on 25 December 2008, that WIN Corporation had bought the naming rights for Jubilee Oval. With this agreement, WIN owned the naming rights to both of St. George Illawarra's home grounds, WIN Jubilee Oval and WIN Stadium. In early 2014, WIN backed out of this sponsorship, with the ground once again reverting to its original name. From 2016, the University of Wollongong held the rights to the ground for a two-year period, ending in late 2017. The ground was known as \"UOW Jubilee Oval\".\n\n\nThe ground is usually simply referred to as \"Kogarah Oval\" by the media and fans.\n\nThe St. George DRLFC which commenced competing in Sydney's top level in the 1921 NSWRFL season, had an unsuccessful debut game at Jubilee Oval in 1936 when they were defeated by Newtown in an exhibition match as part of the Jubilee celebrations. The gate-takings from the match were donated to the St. George Hospital. Saints at this stage were still based at Arncliffe’s Earl Park and it wasn’t until 1950 that Saints returned home to Jubilee Stadium.\n\nThe Dragons played their first official match at the ground on 22 April 1950 against the South Sydney Rabbitohs before 12,500 fans. The Dragons lost a rather exciting match 17-15 but defeat would become quite a rare sight for the Dragons over the coming decades while at Kogarah.\n\nSt. George were based at Kogarah during their world record breaking 11 successive premierships from 1956 to 1966. They set a record at Kogarah and were not beaten at home for an astonishing twelve years: originally beaten by the Balmain Tigers on 26 June 1954 at Kogarah which was just before the beginning of the streak. It wasn’t until 31 July 1966, that they tasted defeat at Kogarah again, eventually losing 12-9 to the Western Suburbs Magpies.\n\nIn 1950, the Dragons began a permanent association with the ground. Around this time was also when St. George legend Norm Provan joined the club and he said of Kogarah:\n\nThe team was based at Jubilee Stadium right up until the completion of the 1985 season. They then chose to abandon the ground and relocated to the Sydney Cricket Ground. The decision was one which they would come to dread. In 1985 St. George had been Club champions, 1st Grade Minor premiers, 1st Grade Runners-Up, Reserve Grade Premiers and Under-23s Premiers. In 1986 Saints missed the semi-finals in all 3 grades for the first time in 50 years. The fans of the club became angry at the club's decision and stayed away from the club in droves while the Dragons remained at the SCG for a further season.\n\nIn 1988 the opportunity came for the club to relocate again. Instead of moving back to Jubilee they decided to move to Belmore Oval. Finally, in 1988 it was decided that the Saints would move home to Jubilee in 1989 with a new stand to be constructed for the 1990 season.\n\nThe club yet again moved in the late 90's and explained to fans the decision was on the basis that Jubilee was too small to accommodate a proposed $30 million stadium complex to meet NRL requirements for playing venues. In a joint statement, Kogarah Council and St. George DRLFC stated that the scale of the proposed 20,000 seat stadium would exceed the size of Jubilee Oval and affect residents. The decision to leave Jubilee upset many of St George Illawarra's loyal supporters as the ground had so much history to it and in July 2000 many supporters held a rally in support of the ground.\n\nThe St George Illawarra Dragons, formed as the result of a merger between St George and the Illawarra Steelers in 1999, use Kogarah as one of their home grounds in the National Rugby League, along with the Steelers former home, WIN Stadium in Wollongong. The newly formed Dragons used Kogarah in the 1999 NRL season, before moving their games to the Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) in 2000.\n\nFrom 2000 until 2002, after many loyal Dragons supporters held a rally and Information Night to persuade the club to move back to Jubilee Stadium (while at the SFS, the team had continued using WIN Stadium), the club did so and would be yet again occupying the famous rugby league ground. During these 3 years that the Dragons did not play at Kogarah, there were talks with the club that they would play at the nearby St George Soccer Stadium, but plans fell through and the soccer stadium has since fallen into disrepair. The Dragons returned to Kogarah in 2003 after a high number of protests and rallies held by supporter group R2K (or Return to Kogarah).\n\nLights were installed at Kogarah in 2006, with the Dragons christening their first night game at the ground with an 8-1 win over the Parramatta Eels in Round 13 of the 2006 season. The game was played in driving rain, which many gave as the reason for a crowd of only 9,075 in attendance.\n\nThe club did not play at the ground in 2008 because of renovations of the south-western end grandstand being built. During this time, the Dragons played at ANZ Stadium. They returned to Kogarah in 2009, where they have remained ever since.\n\nSydney Olympic FC played at Jubilee Stadium in their 2003/2004 season, competing in the National Soccer League.\n\nOn 4 December 2011, it marked the first time an A-League club played a first grade competition game at the venue, with Sydney FC playing Brisbane Roar FC, in front of a crowd of 11,555. Sydney won 2-0, and this game itself would be remembered as the game the Roar lost its first match in the last 36 matches.\n\nIn 2014, the St George Saints got promoted to the NSW Premier League, and moved to this ground as their home-ground stadium. Also, Sydney FC played a few games at this ground in the W-League during their 2013/2014 season.\n\nThe Socceroos have held several open training sessions at this ground since 2013.\n\nSydney FC are using this ground as their primary home venue for the 2018-2019 A-League season, as their usual home ground, the Sydney Football Stadium, is being demolished and a new stadium built on its site. The fan base showed great support for this - having a sellout 19,081 attend their first home match there, against Melbourne Victory 25 November 2018.\n\nCarlton railway station is located a few hundred metres from the ground.\n\nThe ground record attendance for Jubilee Stadium was set in May 1975 when St. George took on South Sydney in front of 23,582 fans. In its modern form, the record attendance is 20,847 when the Dragons took on local rivals the Cronulla Sharks in March 2009.\n\nThe record soccer match attendance was on 25 November, 2018, when Sydney FC took on Melbourne Victory in the A-League in front of a crowd of 19,081.\n\n"}

The slope is in the cricket pitch and runs from the north end of the ground to the south end with a drop of .\n\nThe land on which Lord's was built was originally near a duck pond on a hill in St. John's Wood. It was leased by Thomas Lord following a request from George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea to find a location where cricket could be played in relative privacy. Lord's was built around the slope and was enclosed by stands. In the 21st century, there were calls for the slope to be levelled as a result of the advent of drop-in pitches. Smaller ridges in the pitch had previously been removed by surveyors. However, the Marylebone Cricket Club rejected these calls stating that removal of the slope would require rebuilding of Lord's and would mean that the ground would be unable to host Test cricket for five years as the new pitch would need time to mature after the levelling. In 2002, the Lord's outfield was replaced and drainage installed. During this work, several small deviations in the pitch were removed, but the slope remained. During the 2012 Summer Olympics, when Lord's hosted the Archery tournament, there were suggestions that the slope would affect the archers. However, British archer Alison Williamson rejected this, stating that the slope was barely noticeable.\n\nThe Lord's slope is often used to advantage by bowlers in cricket matches at Lord's. Because of the slope's angles, seam bowlers from the Pavilion End and swing bowlers from the Nursery End gain an advantage as the natural variation of the slope alters the bounce of the ball when bowling. The gradient of the slope is noted to affect right-handed batsmen more than left-handed batsmen as the ball naturally moves towards left-handed batsmen. Despite the advantages the slope gives to bowlers, some batsmen consistently make high scores when playing at Lord's.\n"}

{"id": "3016101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3016101", "title": "Practice squad", "text": "Practice squad\n\nIn sports, the practice squad, also called the taxi squad or practice roster, is a group of players signed by a team but not part of their main roster. Frequently used in American and Canadian football, they serve as extra players during the team's practices, often as part of the scout team by emulating an upcoming opponent's play style. Because the players on the practice squad are familiar with the team's plays and formations, the practice squad serves as a way to develop inexperienced players for promotion to the main roster. In addition, it provides replacement players for the main roster when players are needed as the result of injuries or other roster moves, such as bereavement leave.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Cleveland Browns coach Paul Brown invented the \"taxi squad,\" a group of promising scouted players who did not make the roster but were kept on reserve. The team owner, Arthur \"Mickey\" McBride, put them on the payroll of his taxi company, although they did not drive cabs. The name stuck, and the practice of retaining a squad of ready reserves spread throughout professional football. However, the NFL did not officially recognize the existence of taxi squads until February 18, 1965. On that date, the NFL team owners formally adopted a 40-man active roster supplemented by a taxi squad of unregulated size, which was officially termed the \"future list.\" Over the next few seasons, the NFL gradually limited the allowable number of inactive players to seven, and regulations were established in relation to injured reserve and waiver practices. In 1974, the NFL eliminated the taxi squad altogether, moving the seven inactive spots into an expanded 47-man active roster. Beginning in 1977, a more limited inactive system was introduced (often consisting of either two or four players, depending on the season), and these players were sometimes referred to as taxi squad members. The NFL has since reintroduced larger reserve squads, now known as \"practice squads.\"\n\nStarting in 2017, each NFL team may keep up to ten members on its practice squad in addition to the 53-member main roster. A majority of those on a practice squad are rookie draft picks and undrafted free agents who were released prior to the regular season. A practice squad also includes veterans, up to four as of the season. Players may be signed to a practice squad for several reasons: for lack of space on the team, due to injury, or because they require more development. Practice squad players can be signed to any team's 53-man active roster without compensation at any time during the season.\n\nA player cannot participate on the practice squad for more than three seasons; he is eligible for a third season only if the team has at least 53 players on its active/inactive list for the duration of that player's employment, or have no prior accrued seasons in the NFL (an accrued season is six or more games on the active roster); or if he has accrued a year of NFL experience on a club's 53-man active roster. If the player was on the active list for fewer than 9 games during their \"only accrued season(s)\", he maintains his eligibility for the practice squad. Games in which a player is listed as the third-string quarterback do not count as being on the active list. Former quarterback Mike Quinn, who was listed as the third-string quarterback for several teams throughout his career, is a notable example, being practice squad eligible during his 8th NFL season.\n\nPractice squad players practice alongside regular roster players during the week, but they are not allowed to play in actual games. They can be paid considerably less than active squad players; in 2012, the minimum salary for a practice squad player was $5,700 per week, and the minimum rookie salary was $390,000. Some practice squad players are paid considerably more, however. In 2006, the New England Patriots paid third-year player Billy Yates the full $425,000 he would have earned on the active roster.\n\nMany NFL players spent time on practice squads before finding success in the league, including James Harrison, Jason Peters, Danny Amendola, Danny Woodhead, Arian Foster and Kyle Cook.\n\nThe practice squad has also been used by the NFL and their teams as a way to bring in and train players from outside the United States or Canada, where gridiron football is not a popular sport. The NFL has operated programs in which selected international players were assigned to teams' practice squads as an extra member who did not count towards a team's maximum practice squad size.\n\nThe first, called the International Practice Squad Program, began operation in 2004. In 2005, Rolando Cantu of Mexico was promoted to the Arizona Cardinals' active roster after spending the previous season on the practice squad as a member of the program. Players from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Japan, and Russia also participated. In 2008, the program sponsored sixteen players, the largest amount to date. The program was discontinued for 2009. The rule allowing for an extra practice squad player of international origin, however, remained in the NFL's rulebook and teams attempted to use the rule even after the demise of the program. For example, in 2013 the Detroit Lions attempted to use it to add Norwegian kicker Håvard Rugland to their practice squad, but were rejected by the NFL, which stated that the rule was meant to be used for players from NFL Europe, which folded after the 2007 season.\n\nA new program, the International Player Pathway, was created in 2017. This new initiative started as a trial involving only NFC South teams. Each team in the division was allowed to sign one international player to its practice squad who would not count against the normal 10-player limit, but would not be eligible to be activated during the season after being signed. The pathway was expanded to 8 teams (NFC South and AFC North) for the 2018 season.\n\nAdditionally, several international players have tried to find their starts in the NFL through spending time on teams practice squads without having been part of these programs, such as Efe Obada, Moritz Böhringer, and Jarryd Hayne.\n"}

The stadium is currently in administration.\n\nTowcester opened on 6 December 2014 becoming the first track in Britain to open since the 1995 openings of Harlow and Sittingbourne. The idea of a track inside the horse racing course was created by Lord Hesketh the racecourse owner and Chief Executive Kevin Ackerman. Former Walthamstow Racing Manager Chris Page, Deputy Racing Manager Andy Lisemore and Steve Cale were recruited to run the operation. \n\nAt a cost of £1.5 million the 420 metres circumference circuit was created by laying down 60,000 tonnes of soil so that the greyhound racing surface met the horse racing home straight at a level setting, resulting in a six-metre rise. The bends are very wide which assists the occasional eight dog race. The kennels were constructed inside unused horse stables and new trainers included five times champion trainer Mark Wallis, 2011 champion trainer Chris Allsopp, Kevin Hutton and Matt Dartnall. The distances are 260, 480, 500, 655, 686 and 906 metres and the first race was won by 4-1 shot Fairest Royal trained by Wallis. A big screen situated on the home straight is a new feature to greyhound tracks.\n\n\nIn August 2018 the future of Towcester racecourse was put in doubt. A statement released by the racecourse on 16 August read: \"Towcester Racecourse Company Limited, proprietors of Towcester Racecourse, are currently experiencing trading difficulties and are in discussions with key stakeholders and professional advisers on the way forward. However, the directors have concluded that they have no alternative in the short term but to seek court protection and are now taking steps to place the company into administration. As a result, the last greyhound meeting was on 12 August.\n\nOn 23 August KPMG were appointed as administrators and 134 out of 137 members of staff at the racecourse were made redundant. Eight trainers joined Henlow, including Mark Wallis and Nick Savva while Kevin Hutton joined Monmore.\n\nOn 13 November it was announced by the administrators that the racecourse's assets were being sold to a company called Fermor Land LLP. This company was formed on 18 October (26 days before the sale) and is headed by Lord Hesketh's brother-in-law Mark Westropp, a trustee of the Hesketh Family trusts. \n\n"}

The WSF has organised a number of grand prix events and national championships featuring some of the world's leading strength athletes including 5 time World's Strongest Man winner Mariusz Pudzianowski, Brian Shaw, Mikhail Koklyaev, Krzysztof Radzikowski, Tarmo Mitt, Kevin Nee, Stefan Solvi Petursson, Laurence Shahlaei and Mark Felix. The WSF's flagship programme is the WSF World Cup.\n\nThe WSF was set up in 2007 by Vlad Redkin following a financial dispute with the World Strongman Cup Federation. Following Vlad's departure, the WSCF ceased to promote events and effectively disappeared from the strength athletics landscape. In September 2007 an event in Khanty-Mansijsk formerly affiliated to WSCF and featuring its athletes was promoted by Vlad Redkin. This event had its name changed at short notice from WSCF to the Grand Prix of Khanty-Mansijsk (Russia) and in effect was the first WSF event. The reason given after the competition by Redkin was that a combination of financial reasons as well as concerns over WSCF's stated aim of forming closer ties with the International Federation of Strength Athletes led him to part company with WSCF. He initially planned to cooperate closely with Strongman Super Series in 2008, but in fact set up a new federation called the World Strongman Federation.\n\nIn 2008 the WSF organised a World Cup, it featured Mariusz Pudzianowski amongst others. However, the inaugural season failed to attract as many top tier names as planned and the WSF World Cup season was reduced in scale. By the end of 2008 the new federation was organising one off grand prix events largely based in the countries of the former Soviet Union, featuring fields of athletes confined to those countries.\n\nIn 2011 the WSF began to exert its presence globally once more and a WSF Asian World Cup event was organised, with Tarmo Mitt winning the event and also featuring the comeback event for Kevin Nee who finished third.\n\nIn August 2011 Redkin stated that WSF had an agreement between 8 countries in that time and more were being approached in order to once again stage a WSF World Cup. This materialised and in August 2011 the 2011/12 World Cup was begun.\n\nThe first ever WSF World Strongmen Championship was held February 12–14, 2012 in Abu Dhabi under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Hamdan Al Nahyan. The contest consisted of 25 athletes, after day 1 the field was cut down to 15 athletes, and down to 8 athletes after day 2. The scores were reset to zero after each day of competition, and the finals were held on Feb. 14, 2012.\n\n\nDate: 12 February 2012\nDubai, UAE \nDate: 13 February 2012\nDubai, UAE \nDate: 14 February 2012\nDubai, UAE \nThe 2013 WSF World Championships are scheduled to be held in December, and will also be the finals for the 2013 WSF World Cup. The contest is scheduled to take place in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nOriginally, another event in Khanty-Mansijsk in September 2007 was affiliated to WSMC and featured its athletes. However, the promoter of the event, Vlad Redkin, changed the name from WSMC to the Grand Prix of Khanty-Mansijsk (Russia). The reason given was that after the competition Redkin was parting company with WSMC due to his concerns over WSMC wanting closer ties with the International Federation of Strength Athletes. He also cited that he had lost money with WSMC. He initially planned to cooperate closely with the World Strongman Super Series in 2008, but in fact set up a new federation called the World Strongman Federation.\n\nDate: 8 September 2007\n\nThe new President of WSF Pradeep Baba Madhok quotes “Our distinct target audience, apart from strength enthusiasts, that we aim to give utmost priority to is children and the youth, making them well informed on the importance of nutrition and fitness at a very young age. WSF solely stands by the principal of strength and with that in mind, we hope to inspire the forthcoming generations to reach their dreams.”\n\nWSF World Cup 2016 season plan:\n\n10/04 – Varanasi, India\n\n03/07 – Minsk, Belarus\n\n07/08 – Krynica Zdroj, Poland\n\n08/08 – Omsk, Russia\n\nTBD – European Championship of StrongFit Budapest, Hungary\n\nTBD – ArcticMan 2016, Russia\n\nTBD – Jordan\n\nTBD – UAE\n\nTBD – Qatar\n\nTBD – Los Angeles, USA\n\n"}
