Until the 20th century most bonspiels were held outdoors, on a frozen freshwater loch. Today almost all bonspiels are held indoors on specially prepared artificial ice.\n\nBonspiels originated in Scotland, but the most notable competitive curling tournament in the world nowadays is The Brier, the Canadian Men's Curling Championship. For Canadians, this tournament equals or nearly equals the importance of the Olympics and the World Curling Championship. The Canadian Women's Curling Championship tournament is called Scotties Tournament of Hearts. Several Cashspiels are played in Canada every year. The most important cashspiels are part of the World Curling Tour (WCT). Many local curling clubs and other organizations in Canada also host casual, social bonspiels.\n\nThe United States Curling Association (USA Curling) is the national governing body of the sport in the United States. Many bonspiels are listed on the USA Curling website. Most bonspiels in the United States are held indoors in dedicated curling facilities, but a few bonspiels are held outdoors if the weather allows it. One example of an outdoor bonspiel is the Sawtooth Outdoor Bonspiel held each January in the Sawtooth Mountain Range of Idaho. Bonspiels are popular throughout the United States during curling season, typically October through April. Some special bonspiels are held in the summer as well as some that are hosted by clubs that play on arena ice as there are usually fewer scheduling conflicts with other sports at the area such as hockey and figure skating. The most desired bonspiel is the Fire & Ice Bonspiel held at the Chaska Curling Club in Chaska, MN.\n\nIn Scotland, outdoor bonspiels are now very rare; most lochs that formerly hosted bonspiels, such as Loch Earn, rarely freeze over anymore. The word \"spiel\" is sometimes used to refer to an informal curling game, as in \"parish spiel\". The most important Cashspiels in Scotland are part of the Curling Champions Tour (CCT) The Grand Match was last held outdoors in 1979, although it was revived as an indoor tournament in 2000 and has been held every five years since.\n\nDozens of bonspiels are held in European countries every year. Switzerland hosts multiple Curling Champions Tour events.\n\nCurling bonspiels are held when ice conditions permit in the Maniototo, part of Central Otago in the South Island. The region is one of the few in New Zealand to have conditions suitable for outdoor curling, and is also a fitting site for the sport given that Otago's original European settlers were mainly from Scotland. Several artificial and natural lakes around the towns of Oturehua, Naseby and Patearoa provide good conditions, on average every second or third year.\n\nThe national bonspiel has been held when conditions permit since 1879, with Oturehua's Idaburn Dam the venue since 1932. The most recent national bonspiel, the 66th, was held on 13-14 July 2015. Most New Zealand curling clubs are located in Otago, Canterbury, and Southland, and owing to the difficulty of getting teams to the relatively inaccessible venue, it is rare for teams to travel from outside the southern South Island to the bonspiel.\n\nIndoor curling rinks exist in Otago's main centre, Dunedin (at the Dunedin Ice Stadium), and in the towns of Naseby, Otago and Gore, Southland, and also further north in the country's largest city, Auckland. Open air ice rinks exist in Naseby and Alexandra.\n\n\nPossibly from Dutch \"bond\" \"league, association\" + \"spel\" \"game\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "239919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=239919", "title": "Bunt (baseball)", "text": "Bunt (baseball)\n\nA bunt is a special type of offensive technique in baseball or fastpitch softball. In a bunt play, the batter loosely holds the bat in front of the plate and intentionally taps the ball into play.\n\nThe primary goal in bunting is to ground the ball into fair territory, as far from the fielders as possible, generally while staying within the infield. This requires not only physical dexterity and concentration, but also a knowledge of the fielders' positions, their relation to the baserunner or baserunners, their likely response to the bunt, and knowledge of the pitcher's most likely pitches.\n\nThe bunt is often characterized by the batter turning his body toward the pitcher and sliding one hand up the barrel of the bat to help steady it. This is called squaring up. Depending on the type of bunt, the batter might square well before the pitcher begins throwing, or as the pitch is being batted. Alternatively, a batter may square up and retract the bat to take a normal swing as the pitch is delivered. \n\nIn a sacrifice bunt, the batter will put the ball into play with the intention of advancing a baserunner, in exchange for the batter being thrown out. The sacrifice bunt is most often used to advance a runner from first to second base, although the runner may also be advanced from second to third base, or from third to home. The sacrifice bunt is most often used in close, low-scoring games, and it is usually performed by weaker hitters, especially by pitchers in games played in National League parks. A sacrifice bunt is not counted as an at-bat. In general, when sacrifice bunting, a batter will square to bunt well before the pitcher releases the ball.\n\nThe squeeze play occurs when the batter sacrifices with the purpose of scoring a runner from third base. In the suicide squeeze, in which the runner on third base starts running for home plate as soon as the pitcher starts to pitch the ball, it is integral that the batter bunt the ball successfully, or the runner will likely be tagged out easily. Due to the high-risk nature of this play, it is not often executed, but can often be an exciting moment within the game. If a runner scores in a squeeze play, the batter may be credited with an RBI.\n\nA batter may also bunt for a base hit. This is not a sacrifice play, because the batter is trying to reach base safely, without any intention of advancing a runner. A batter may try to bunt for a base hit while there are runners on base. In this case, if the runner advances and the batter is thrown out, and if the official scorer judges that the intention of the batter was to bunt for a base hit, then the batter will not receive credit for a sacrifice bunt. A batter bunting for a base hit will often hold back his bunt while the pitcher begins delivering the ball, in order to surprise the fielders. If successful, the bunt is scored as a hit single. Rarely does a bunt result in an extra base hit (double, triple or home run).\n\nOften when attempting to bunt for a base hit, the batter will begin running as he is bunting the ball. This is called a drag bunt. Left-handed batters perform this more often than right-handed hitters, because their stance in the batter's box is closer to first base, and they do not need to run across home plate, where the ball will be pitched, as they bunt.\n\nThe action of squaring to bunt is compromised during a drag bunt, as the feet are not set. Players sometimes get one hand up the barrel, and other times bunt with both hands at the base of the bat. There have been instances of one-handed drag bunts as well; Rafael Furcal has been known to try such a bunt.\n\nA swinging bunt occurs when a poorly hit ball rolls a short distance into play, much like a bunt. A swinging bunt is often the result of a checked swing, and only has the appearance of a bunt. It is not a true bunt, and if the scorer judges that the batter intended to hit the ball, it cannot be counted as a sacrifice. There is also a \"slug\" bunt that is intended to surprise the opposing defense, as the desired effect is a hard-hit ball into the infield defense that is expecting a standard bunt.\n\nFielding a bunt is often more difficult than fielding a regularly batted ball. Bunts are often hit slowly, so fielders must charge the ball to get to it quickly, in order to throw out a runner in time. Well-placed bunts sometimes can be impossible to field, and often go as base hits. The main idea in bunting for a base hit is to hit the ball fast enough to get it by the pitcher, but slow enough to not give the other infielders enough time to make a play. Bunting a ball into no-man's land – the triangle between the locations of the pitcher, first baseman, and second baseman, and between the pitcher, catcher and third baseman – often succeeds because of confusion among the fielders as to which should field the ball and which should receive the throw to first base. It is common for all three fielders to try to field the ball, and for nobody to cover the bag, or for no one to try to field the ball, assuming someone else will handle it. Teams often use a rotation play to defend against the bunt: the first baseman will charge the bunt and the second baseman \"rotates\" out of his usual position to cover first base and receive the throw. The shortstop covers the base the advancing runner is headed towards.\n\nA foul bunt that is not caught in flight is always counted as a strike, even if it is a third strike and thus results in a strikeout of the batter. This is distinct from all other foul balls which, if not caught in flight, are only counted as a strike if \"not\" a third strike. This special exception applies only to true bunts, not on any bunt-like contacts that might occur during a full swing or check-swing. If a batter bunts the ball and his bat hits the ball again after initial contact, it is a dead ball even if by accident.\n\nAdditionally, the infield fly rule is not applied to bunts popped-up in the air. Instead, the intentional drop rule (Rule 6.05l) that also applies to line drives can be invoked.\n\nIt is impossible to say exactly when the bunt was introduced into baseball, but the offensive technique now known as the bunt was almost certainly invented by one of the sport's most famous early figures, Dickey Pearce. For much of his career, Pearce used his 'tricky hit' to tremendous effect as rules permitted it to roll foul and still be counted as a hit. The bunt was not common until the 1880s, and was not an accepted part of baseball strategy until the 20th century. The bunt has enjoyed periodic waves of acceptance and use throughout baseball history, coinciding with the periodic shifts of dominance between pitching and hitting over the decades.\n\nDuring periods of pitching dominance, for example, during the dead-ball era or the 1960s, bunting was an important offensive weapon. Conversely, during periods of hitting dominance, for example, the 1990s and 2000s, the value of the bunt has often been questioned. Recently, teams following the \"Moneyball\" school of baseball thought (such as the Oakland Athletics, the Boston Red Sox, and the 2004-2005 Los Angeles Dodgers) have shown the tendency to shun the sacrifice bunt almost entirely. However, a simple canvass of the 2002-2005 World Series champions (the 2002 Los Angeles Angels acting as the primary \"small ball\" trendsetter for the 2000s) reveals that each team used bunting frequently in order to overcome strictly power hitting teams. Nevertheless, the role of the bunt in baseball strategy is one of the perennial topics of discussion for baseball fans.\n"}

It is similar to golf, except that it uses an oval ball and holes are replaced by suspended goal nets. In addition, the green is replaced by a \"yard\", and a player whose ball lies in the yard has the right to turn the goal net so as to face them.\n\nAccording to Silver, the oval ball is designed so as to give the player more control over where the ball travels. Burton Silver explains:\n\nBecause the oval ball spins on two axes, it is almost impossible to hook or slice it. However, controlled hooks and slices are easily achieved by angling the ball on the specially designed tee adaptor. Back-spinning the ball and running it on is also achievable by the way in which the ball is set up on the tee.\n\nAccording to NZ player Greg Turner, GolfCross is a more strategic and tactical game than regular golf, especially in match play, and because players are shooting for goal it tends to be more dramatic and exciting to play and watch.\n\nGolfCross can bring back many advantages to normal golf. The mindset that the ball will hardly ever slice or hook can be bought back to golf and used effectively.\n\nThere are GolfCross courses in Germany, Argentina, England, Ireland, Scotland and New Zealand. It is still unclear how widely GolfCross is played. Recent interest has centered on its ecological advantages. Because it doesn't use putting greens, agricultural chemicals can be done away with, and because the ball is easy for any player to back spin, fairways don't require irrigating to keep them soft in order to reduce run-on.\n\n"}

It consists of pushing the ball rapidly from right to left and then from left to right repeatedly by turning the hockey stick. Once mastered, it is a very good way to beat your opponent, as a player using Indian dribble is hard to defend against. It was named after the superb dribbling skills of the Indian and Pakistani teams.\n\nIt was introduced by the Indian and the Pakistani teams. This new technique was one of the key points that helped these countries lead the field hockey world at that time. Until the mid-1950s playing the ball on the right hand side was dominant but this changed following a tour by the German National team to Pakistan. In 1954 players studied the Pakistan methods for four weeks, analysing their individual skills at controlling the ball in front of the body. As a result, the “Indian Dribble“ and the shorter Asian blade of sticks were introduced to the German game. Due to the changed position of the ball, and with the help of new blades, players’ behaviour was less predictable. They had a greater variety of passing and deception options.\n\nA new skill in 1950s, it is now a basic technique in field hockey.\n\nIn the 1980s astro-turf was introduced and it was used for hockey. It was then easier for other nationalities to master the techniques. It is used in many ways when playing hockey matches.\n\nMajor Dhyan Chand, who to some people is the best field hockey player in history, is well remembered and known for his ability at executing the dribbling. Back in the day, his wooden stick was cut in half just to check that there were no magnets or illegal enhancements that were allowing him to play like that.\n\nShahbaz Ahmed is one of the best dribblers in history. His skills were so fast that he is still remembered because of that. His generation was able to achieve many victories for Pakistan.\n\nLuciana Aymar, probably the best female player in history.

The book includes analysis of eleven chess openings but also contains many elementary errors that led chess historian H. J. R. Murray to suggest that it was prepared in a hurry. The book was written when the rules of chess were taking their modern form (see ), and some of the 150 positions in the book are of the old game and some of the new. Fewer than a dozen copies of the book exist.\n\nCommentators have suggested that much of the material was plagiarised from Francesc Vicent's now lost 1495 work \"Libre dels jochs partits dels schacs en nombre de 100\".\n\nThe Lucena position is named after him, even though it does not appear in his book.

It is intended to be carried on one's person at all times, be appropriate to all environments, and be a comprehensive kit without being too large. Other personal gear will primarily offer additional serviceability and ease of use, but the mini survival kit should provide for the basic needs of a survival situation, followed by self rescue, assistance, or a return to normalcy in optimum situations.\n\nTwo philosophies surround the preparation of mini survival kits. Some people like to carry a few, relatively large items such as a knife, matches, whistle, emergency food, water bottle, etc. Others prefer a collection of smaller but more comprehensive items such as rubber bands, paper clips, fishing equipment, lashing material, razor blades, etc. The decision of which technique to subscribe to depends on one's physical condition, survival skills, wilderness knowledge, and other factors.\n\nThe survival tools and supplies found in a mini survival kit are generally kept in a container that is small enough to fit in a pocket. Altoids tins are commonly used, but many other options exist, including specially purchased mini-survival kit tins, regular tobacco boxes, life capsules, film canisters, plastic bottles, tin cans or boxes. The popular Altoids-type tins measure approximately x x . Some kinds of containers benefit from waterproofing, which may be done with adhesive tape or dipping the closed container in paraffin wax.\n\nAn alternative approach is to carry mini-survival kit items in no container at all, but loose on a neck-chain, or directly in a satchel, pouch or belt pouch. Additionally, it may also be included into the belt itself (as is done in money belts ).\n\nBecause each kit depends on the situation and environment the person is carrying it in, there isn't a \"one size fits all\" kit.

Benfica\n\nSport Lisboa e Benfica (), commonly known as Benfica, is a sports club based in Lisbon, Portugal. It is best known for the professional football team playing in the Primeira Liga, the top flight of the Portuguese football league system, where they are the most successful club in terms of titles won.\n\nFounded on 28 February 1904 as \"Sport Lisboa\", Benfica is one of the \"Big Three\" clubs in Portugal that have never been relegated from the Primeira Liga, along with rivals Sporting CP and FC Porto. The Benfica team is nicknamed \"Águias\" (Eagles), for the symbol atop the club's crest, and \"Encarnados\" (Reds), for the shirt colour. Since 2003, their home ground has been the Estádio da Luz, which replaced the larger, original one, built in 1954. Benfica is the most supported Portuguese club, with an estimated 14 million supporters worldwide, and the European club with the highest percentage of supporters in its own country. By the end of 2016, Benfica had 184,264 paying members. The club's anthem, \"Ser Benfiquista\", refers to its supporters, who are called \"benfiquistas\". Águia Vitória is the mascot. Benfica is honoured with three Portuguese Orders: those of Christ (Commander), of Prince Henry (Honorary Member) and of Merit (Officer).\n\nWith a total of 81 major trophies won – 82 including the Latin Cup – Benfica is the most decorated club in Portugal. They have won 79 domestic trophies: a record 36 Primeira Liga titles, a record 26 Taça de Portugal, a record 7 Taça da Liga, 7 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira and 3 Campeonato de Portugal. Internationally, they won back-to-back European Cups in 1961 and 1962 – a unique feat in Portuguese football – and were runners-up at the Intercontinental Cup in 1961 and '62, at the European Cup in 1963, '65, '68, '88 and '90, and at the UEFA Cup/Europa League in 1983, 2013 and '14. Benfica's ten European finals are a domestic record and ranked seventh all-time among UEFA clubs in 2014. Moreover, Benfica hold the European record for the most consecutive wins in domestic league and the record for the longest unbeaten run in Primeira Liga, where they became the first undefeated champions, in 1972–73.\n\nBenfica was ranked twelfth in FIFA Club of the Century and ninth in IFFHS Top 200 European clubs of the 20th century. Currently, Benfica is ranked 23rd in the UEFA club coefficient rankings and has the second most participations in the European Cup/UEFA Champions League (38). In this tournament, they hold the overall record for the biggest aggregate win, achieved in 1965–66.\n\nOn 28 February 1904, members of Associação do Bem (a group of former students from the Real Casa Pia de Lisboa) met at the back of Farmácia Franco on \"Rua de Belém\" with the goal of forming a social and cultural football club called \"Sport Lisboa\", composed of Portuguese players only. 24 people attended the meeting, including Cosme Damião, who would be the club's most important leader in the first decades. In that meeting, José Rosa Rodrigues was appointed club president, along with Daniel Brito as secretary and Manuel Gourlade as treasurer. The founders decided that the club's colours would be red and white and that the crest would be composed of an eagle, the motto \"E pluribus unum\" and a football. Sport Lisboa played their first match ever on 1 January 1905, scoring their first goal. Despite important victories, the club suffered from poor operating conditions, namely the football dirt field Terras do Desembargador. As a result, eight players moved to Sporting CP in 1907 and started the rivalry between the clubs.\n\nOn 13 September 1908, Sport Lisboa acquired Grupo Sport Benfica by mutual agreement and changed its name to \"Sport Lisboa e Benfica\". Despite the club merger, they continued their respective club operations. For Sport Lisboa, they maintained the football team, the shirt colours, the eagle symbol and the motto. For Grupo Sport Benfica, they maintained the field Campo da Feiteira, the main directors and the club's house. Both clubs determined that the foundation date should coincide with Sport Lisboa's because it was the most recognised club and quite popular in Lisbon due to its football merits. In regard to the crest, a cycling wheel was added to Sport Lisboa's to represent the most important sport of Grupo Sport Benfica. Furthermore, the two entities of the \"new\" club had simultaneous members who helped stabilise operations, which later increased the success of the merger.\n\nHowever, problems with the club's rented field (the Campo da Feiteira) remained. Benfica moved to their first football grass field, the Campo de Sete Rios, in 1913. Four years later, after refusing an increase in rent, they relocated to the Campo de Benfica. Finally, in 1925, they moved to their own stadium, the Estádio das Amoreiras, playing there 15 years before moving to the Estádio do Campo Grande in 1940. The Portuguese league began in 1934, and after finishing third in its first edition, Benfica won the next three championships in a row (1935–36, '36–37, '37–38) – the club's first \"tri\", achieved by Lippo Hertzka. Throughout the 1940s, Benfica would win three more Primeira Liga (1941–42, '42–43, '44–45) and four Taça de Portugal (1940, '43, '44, '49), with coach János Biri achieving the first double for the club in 1943.\n\nBenfica's first international success happened in 1950 when they won the Latin Cup (the only Portuguese club to do so), defeating Bordeaux with a golden goal from Julinho at the Estádio Nacional in Lisbon, with Ted Smith as coach. It was the first major international trophy won by a Portuguese club. They reached another final of the competition in 1957 but lost to Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu. With the election of president Joaquim Ferreira Bogalho in 1952 and the arrival of coach Otto Glória in 1954, Benfica became more modernised and professional and moved into the original Estádio da Luz, with an initial seating capacity of 40,000; expanded to 70,000 in 1960. During the 1950s, Benfica won three Primeira Liga (1949–50, '54–55, '56–57 – they were champions in 1955 but were not invited to the inaugural European Cup) and six Taça de Portugal (1951, '52, '53, '55, '57, '59).\n\nLed by coach Béla Guttmann, Benfica were one of two teams, along with Barcelona, to break Real Madrid's dominance in the European Cup by winning two consecutive trophies: the first one against Barcelona in 1961 (3–2) and the second one against Real Madrid in 1962 (5–3). Later on, Benfica reached another three European Cup finals but lost them to Milan in 1963, to Inter in 1965, and to Manchester United in 1968. The 1960s were Benfica's best period, in which they won eight Primeira Liga (1959–60, '60–61, '62–63, '63–64, '64–65, '66–67, '67–68, '68–69), three Taça de Portugal (1962, '64, '69) and two European Cups (1960–61, '61–62). Many of their successes in that decade were achieved with Eusébio – the only player to win the Ballon d'Or for a Portuguese club – Coluna, José Águas, José Augusto, Simões, Torres and others, who formed the 1963–64 team that set a club record of 103 goals in 26 league matches. Benfica were ranked first in European football in 1965, '66 and '69. Moreover, they were presented with the \"France Football\" European Team of the Year award in 1968.\n\nDuring the 1970s, with president Borges Coutinho, Benfica faded slightly from the European scene but remained the main force in Portuguese football, as they won six Primeira Liga titles (1970–71, '71–72, '72–73, '74–75, '75–76, '76–77) and two Taça de Portugal (1970, '72). In 1971–72, Benfica attracted Europe-wide attention once again when they reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, where they were eliminated by Ajax of Johan Cruyff. In the following season, led by Jimmy Hagan, Benfica became the first club in Portugal to win the league without defeat, winning 28 matches – 23 consecutively – out of 30, and drawing 2. They scored 101 goals, and Eusébio was later crowned Europe's top scorer, again, this time with 40 goals. This decade was also marked by the fact that Benfica started to admit foreign players in the team, becoming the last Portuguese club to do so, in 1979.\n\nIn the 1980s, Benfica continued to thrive domestically. With Lajos Baróti in 1980–81, Benfica became the first club to win all Portuguese trophies in one season: Supertaça de Portugal, Primeira Liga and Taça de Portugal. Later, under the guidance of Sven-Göran Eriksson, they won two consecutive Primeira Liga (1982–83, '83–84), one Taça de Portugal (1983) and reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 1983, lost to Anderlecht. Following improvements to the Estádio da Luz, Benfica opened the stadium's third tier in 1985, transforming it into the largest stadium in Europe and third largest in the world. One season later, after they had won the domestic cup in 1986, Benfica clinched the double of Primeira Liga and Taça de Portugal. Then, from 1988 to 1994, Benfica made a significant investment in order to win another European Cup, reaching two European Cup finals in 1988 and '90, won by PSV Eindhoven and Milan, respectively. During the same period, Benfica won three Primeira Liga (1988–89, '90–91, '93–94) and one Taça de Portugal (1993).\n\nFinancial trouble in the early 1980s and a large investment on players throughout that decade started to deteriorate the club's finances under Jorge de Brito's presidency. The rampant spending and a questionable signing policy (over 100 players during Manuel Damásio's term) further aggravated the problem. Soon after, Benfica entered in default during João Vale e Azevedo's presidency. In 2001, with president Manuel Vilarinho, club members approved the construction of the new Estádio da Luz, which would eventually cost €162 million. The period from 1994 to 2003 was arguably the most difficult in the club's history. During that time, Benfica had a total of eleven managers, won a single Taça de Portugal, suffered their biggest defeat in European competitions, 7–0 to Celta de Vigo, had their lowest league finish ever, a sixth place, and were absent from European competition for two years.\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, with president Luís Filipe Vieira, Benfica put an end to their silverware drought by winning the Taça de Portugal against José Mourinho's Porto. They dedicated the trophy to Miklós Fehér, who had died in January 2004. In the following year, Benfica won the league title, eleven years after the previous one, and the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. After that and until 2009, when Benfica won its first Taça da Liga (thus becoming the first club to win all major domestic competitions), they did not win any trophies and finished fourth in the 2007–08 league. In Europe, Benfica had three consecutive appearances in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, with their best result being a quarter-final stage in 2005–06, after beating Manchester United in the decisive group stage encounter and overcoming then European champions Liverpool on 3–0 aggregate.\n\nFor the 2009–10 season, Jorge Jesus was appointed as manager, a position he held until 2015. During that six-season span, Benfica won 10 domestic trophies, including an unprecedented treble in Portuguese football (league, cup and league cup) in 2014, as well as the club's first back-to-back league titles since 1984. At European level, Benfica moved from 23rd to 6th place in UEFA's team ranking as a result of their performance in international competition: they reached their first European semi-final in seventeen years at the 2010–11 Europa League, repeated the 2005–06 Champions League quarter-finals in the 2011–12 campaign and were runners-up in Europa League for two consecutive seasons (2012–13 and '13–14).\n\nManager Rui Vitória joined Benfica in 2015 and continued the club's success by winning their third consecutive league title and the Taça da Liga. In the following campaign, Benfica went on winning the Primeira Liga title for a fourth straight season – the club's first \"tetra\" – the Taça de Portugal and the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira, in another treble achievement. Internationally, Benfica reached, for the first time, the Champions League knockout phase for a second season in a row. Nevertheless, the next season, they only won the domestic Super Cup, had the worst Portuguese campaign in the Champions League, which included their biggest loss ever in the competition, 5–0 to Basel, and finished second in Primeira Liga.\n\nBenfica's crest is composed of an eagle (as a symbol of independence, authority and nobility), positioned atop the shield with the colours red and white (symbolising bravery and peace, respectively); the motto \"E pluribus unum\" (\"Out of many, one\" – defining union between all members); and the club's initials (\"SLB\") over a football; everything superimposed on a bicycle wheel (representing one of the first sports in the club, cycling).\n\nThe club has had four main crests since its inception in 1904. The origin of the current crest goes back to 1908 when Sport Lisboa merged with Grupo Sport Benfica. Back then, only red and white colours were displayed on the crest. In 1930, the crest was altered and the colours from the flag of Portugal were added. Sixty-nine years later, in 1999, the crest was changed again. The most significant changes were the modification and repositioning of the eagle and the reduction of the size of the wheel.\n\nBenfica have used commemorative crests since 2010 by adding stars over the crest. They started by adding one star in celebration of their first European Cup, and in 2011, they added two stars to commemorate their second one. A year later, they started using three stars, with each star representing 10 league titles won by the club.\n\nJosé da Cruz Viegas was the man responsible for the selection of Benfica's kit in 1904. Red and white colours were chosen for being the ones that stood out better to the eye. One year after its foundation, the club opted for red shirts with white collars, openings and cuffs, combined with white shorts and black socks. Benfica's white alternative kit was officially used for the first time in 1944–45 when Salgueiros, who also wore red, were promoted to the first division.\n\nBenfica have always worn red shirts. For this reason, in Portugal, Benfica and its supporters (benfiquistas) were nicknamed \"vermelhos\" (\"reds\"). This changed in 1936 with the start of the Spanish Civil War: the Portuguese Estado Novo's Censorship Commission censored the word \"vermelhos\" because the Popular Front communists in Spain were also known as \"vermelhos\". From then on, Benfica became known as \"encarnados\" (similar to \"reds\" but with a different connotation).\n\nDuring the club's first decades, Benfica played mostly in rented grounds. Their first own stadium was the Estádio das Amoreiras, built and opened in 1925. There they played until 1940. A year later, they moved to the Estádio do Campo Grande, a rented municipal stadium, before relocating to their own second ground, thirteen years later.\n\nFrom 1954 to 2003, Benfica played at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, the largest stadium in Europe and third largest in the world in terms of capacity between 1985 and 1987, with a 120,000 seating capacity. It was demolished in 2003 and the new Estádio da Luz was built in that year, with a total cost of €162 million, roughly €25 million more than the planned\n\nLike its predecessor, the Estádio da Luz is officially named Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica. A UEFA category four stadium, it hosted several matches of the UEFA Euro 2004, including the final, and was the venue for the 2014 UEFA Champions League Final. Built with a full seating capacity of 65,647, the stadium currently has 64,642 seats.\n\nBenfica's training centre and youth academy, named Caixa Futebol Campus, is located in Seixal, Lisbon Region. It was built in 2005 and opened on 22 September 2006. In 2015, Benfica received the award for Best Academy of the year at the Globe Soccer Awards.\n\nThe Museu Benfica – Cosme Damião, located near the stadium, was inaugurated on 26 July 2013 and opened to the public on 29 July. It was considered the Best Portuguese Museum of 2014 by the Portuguese Association of Museology.\n\nThe supporters of Benfica are known as \"benfiquistas\". They sing the club's anthem at the start of every home match and sometimes during the match. They call the club \"o Glorioso\" (the Glorious One), hence the popular chant \"Glorioso SLB\". In some countries, since 1952, Benfica has had supporters' clubs known as \"Casas do Benfica\" (Benfica Houses), which are places where benfiquistas gather. In recent years, benfiquistas have celebrated league titles with the team at the Marquis of Pombal Square in Lisbon.\n\nBenfica is the most popular club in Portugal and has always been seen as the working-class club of Portugal. According to a study done by professors Luís Reto and Jorge de Sá, with the stamp of approval by Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE) and Secretaria de Estado das Comunidades, Benfica has approximately 14 million supporters worldwide: over 5.5 million in Europe (4.7 in Portugal); over 6 million in Mozambique (3.8) and Angola (2.7); over 1 million in the United States and Canada; and the rest being located in Brazil, Venezuela, Caribbean, Indochina, China, Australia and India. According to a study performed for UEFA in 2012, Benfica is the European club with the highest percentage of supporters in its own country (47%).\n\nIn the 2016–17 season, Benfica had an average home attendance of 55,952 in the Portuguese league, the current record at the Estádio da Luz. It was the highest average of the competition and 9th highest among other European clubs. The highest home attendance record was also broken – 64,519 spectators saw Benfica's 5–0 win over Vitória de Guimarães in the season's last match at Da Luz.\n\nThe members of Benfica, who are called \"sócios\", democratically elect the club president for a four-year term (three years until 2010) by voting in each candidate list, forming the highest governing body of the club. They also participate in general assemblies, submit proposals, take part in discussions, and so forth. They can be elected to governing bodies, to be designated for positions or functions at the club, etc. In 2003 the club switched to electronic voting, and since 2010 only members with 25 years of uninterrupted filiation as an adult (43 years of age) can candidate to the presidency of Benfica.\n\nOn 9 November 2006, Benfica set the Guinness World Record for \"the most widely supported football club\", with 160,398 paid-up members. In 2014, according to a study by Movimento Por Um Futebol Melhor, Benfica had 270,000 members and was the biggest club in the world in membership terms. On 31 March 2015, Benfica reported to have 246,401 members; however, after a scheduled renumbering by the club in August 2015, the number decreased to 156,916. In April 2017, Benfica reported they had a total of 184,264 members by 31 December 2016.\n\nBenfica has rivalries with Sporting CP and FC Porto, with whom it forms the \"Big Three\": Portugal's most decorated clubs. None of them have been relegated from the Portuguese league since its establishment in 1934.\n\nAs Lisbon-based clubs, Benfica and Sporting have shared a rivalry for over a century; it all started in 1907 when eight prominent Benfica players defected to Sporting. Followed in Europe, Africa and the Americas, any match between both teams is known as \"dérbi de Lisboa\" (\"Lisbon derby\"), \"dérbi eterno\" (\"eternal derby\"), \"dérbi da Segunda Circular\", \"dérbi dos dérbis\" (\"derby of the derbies\") – the most important football derby in Portugal.\n\nThe rivalry between Benfica and FC Porto, which started with a friendly match on 28 April 1912, comes about as Lisbon and Porto are the largest Portuguese cities, respectively. Benfica and Porto are currently the two most decorated clubs in Portuguese football, with the former historically being the most decorated team overall. Any match between the two sides is called \"O Clássico\" (\"The Classic\").\n\nIn 2008, Benfica launched its own sports-oriented television network, Benfica TV (BTV for short), the first channel by a Portuguese club, and has operated it ever since. Its premium channel broadcasts Benfica's live matches at home in the Primeira Liga, home matches from Benfica B in the LigaPro, from the under-19 team and below, as well as matches from other sports of the club, including youth categories. Until 2016, it broadcast three seasons of the English Premier League, and one season of the Italian Serie A and French Ligue 1.\n\nMoreover, the club publishes the weekly newspaper \"O Benfica\" each Friday, since 28 November 1942. It contains information about everything in the club in the form of news and articles (mostly the former). By 2005, it had a circulation of close to 10,000. Benfica also publishes the quarterly magazine \"Mística\" since 6 December 2007. Free of charge for Benfica members, it comprises interviews with players and personnel of the club, reports about the club's history and recent events, news, opinion pieces, overviews of different sports of the club, with football being its main focus, and a section dedicated to club members. Issue 33 had a circulation of 115,602 in mainland Portugal. \"O Benfica Ilustrado\" was the club's former magazine; it was launched in September 1957 as an alternative/complement to the news density of \"O Benfica\".\n\nSport Lisboa e Benfica – Futebol, SAD (a public limited company) was created by João Vale e Azevedo on 10 February 2000 with an initial equity of €75 million.\nThere were five major reasons for creating an autonomous entity to manage the Benfica team: participation in professional football competitions at domestic and international level; development of football players; exploitation of TV rights on open and closed channels; management of the players' image rights; exploitation of the Benfica brand by the professional football team and at sporting events.\n\nBenfica SAD entered the PSI-20 on 21 May 2007 with an initial stock value of €5 on 15,000,001 shares. Later in June that year, Joe Berardo launched a partial takeover bid for Benfica SAD (60%) for €3.50 a share, which was unsuccessful. Following the general assembly of 23 December 2009, the SAD increased the €75 million equity to €115 million by absorbing Benfica Estádio, SA (then owner of the Estádio da Luz), resulting in balance sheet insolvency.\n\nOn 31 July 2014, the SAD completed the acquisition of Benfica Stars Fund by spending roughly €28.9 million for 85%, thus purchasing the remaining economic rights of nine players. Later in April, Benfica and Adidas renewed their previous ten-season contract of 2003 until 2021, for around €4.5 million per year. In May 2015, Emirates airline signed a three-year sponsorship deal worth up to €30 million in order to become Benfica's main jersey sponsor. Then in December, Benfica sold their first-team TV rights as well as the distribution and broadcasting rights to NOS in a three-year deal, receiving €40 million per season, with the option to extend the contract to a maximum of ten seasons, totalling €400 million. Days later, Luís Filipe Vieira stated that the money from the latter contract would be used to lower Benfica's debt.\n\nIn June 2016, Benfica was ranked by Brand Finance as the 47th most valuable football brand, valued at €86 million. By June 2017, Benfica had earned €617 million from player transfers since the 2010–11 season, more than any other club in the world. In January 2018, Benfica was ranked by Deloitte as the thirtieth highest revenue generating football club, with a revenue of €157.6 million. Later in September that year, Benfica SAD reported a profit of €20.6 million (a decrease of 53.7%) and a total revenue of €206.2 million (a decrease of 18,7%). Moreover, they reported a record total equity of €86.8 million: total assets of €485.1 million (a decrease of 4.1%) and total liabilities of €398.3 million (a decrease of €40.1 million). It was the first time since 2010–11 that the debt was below €400 million.\n\nOn 27 January 2004, Benfica retired the squad number 29 in memory of Miklós Fehér, who had died while playing for them two days earlier.\n\nBenfica have won a record 36 Primeira Liga, a record 26 Taça de Portugal (and 4 consecutively), a record 7 Taça da Liga (and 4 consecutively), 7 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira and 3 Campeonato de Portugal (and 2 consecutively) – totalling 79 domestic trophies – and 2 European Cups (consecutively won) – totalling 81 trophies, or 82 including the Latin Cup. Therefore, in terms of overall trophies, Benfica is the most decorated club in Portuguese football. (The Latin Cup, a forerunner of the European Cup, is excluded from the trophy count by FIFA, although its official website did include it.)\n\nIn 2014, Benfica achieved the first ever treble of Primeira Liga, Taça de Portugal and Taça da Liga. As of the 2017–18 season, Benfica is the only club to have won the Primeira Liga and Taça da Liga double, moreover, four times. Benfica is also the only club in Portugal to have successfully defended every major domestic title (Campeonato de Portugal, Primeira Liga, Taça de Portugal, Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira and Taça da Liga). In addition, Benfica are the only Portuguese team to have become back-to-back European champions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

With 66 trails, and vertical, Solitude is one of the smaller ski resorts near Salt Lake City, along with its neighbor Brighton. It is a family-oriented mountain, with a wider range of beginner and intermediate slopes than other nearby ski resorts; 50% of its slopes are graded \"beginner\" or \"intermediate,\" the highest such ratio in the Salt Lake City area. Solitude was one of the first major US resorts to adopt an RFID lift ticket system, allowing lift lines to move more efficiently while reducing \"lift poaching\". It was followed by Alta Ski Area in 2007. Solitude is adjacent to Brighton Ski Resort near the top of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Solitude and Brighton offer a common \"Solbright Pass\" which provides access to both resorts for a nominal surcharge.\n\nMost of Solitude's trails descend from a ridge (Eagle Ridge trail) which runs parallel with The Big Cottonwood Canyon Scenic Byway as it rises up the center of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Two lifts—quad chairs Powder Horn II and Eagle Express—run to the top of Eagle Ridge, while quads Apex Express and Moonbeam Express feed the intermediate and beginner terrain (respectively) immediately below it. The back of Eagle Ridge drops into Honeycomb Canyon, a long valley with most of the resort's bowl skiing. Honeycomb Canyon is primarily accessed by the Summit Express Chair lift, which runs behind Eagle Ridge to the mountain's summit; return access from the bottom of Honeycomb Canyon is also available via the Honeycomb Return quad. The Summit Chair also provides access to adjacent Brighton Ski Resort. Two more lifts, Link double and Sunrise triple, provide dedicated skiing areas for beginners.\n\nSolitude was first developed for skiing by Moab, Utah, uranium tycoon Robert M. Barrett. Barrett decided to start his own ski resort after being denied the use of the restrooms at Alta, which were reserved for Alta guests only. He started construction at Solitude in 1956, having bought all the land in Big Cottonwood Canyon, the next canyon over from Alta. The resort opened for business one year later, and passed through ownership changes until it was acquired by a business group led by Gary DeSeelhorst in 1977. DeSeelhorst became the resort's sole owner in 1986 and implemented an aggressive renovation project, including the 1989 construction of Utah's first express quad chairlift, Eagle Express. Accommodations upgrades in this period included the construction of the Creekside lodge in 1995.\n\nOn October 3, 2014, Deer Valley Resort announced that they had entered into an agreement to buy Solitude from the DeSeelhorst family and took over operation of the resort on May 1, 2015. During the summer of 2015 under the new leadership of Deer Valley Resort, the existing Summit double chair was replaced with a new high speed detachable quad with a new alignment. The new lift combined with a new access trail from the top of the Apex Express lift will significantly decrease the travel time to Honeycomb Canyon.\n\nIn August 2017, parent resort Deer Valley was acquired by the new multi-resort entity called Alterra Mountain Company. Solitude continued to be owned by the former Deer Valley ownership for one more season until it was announced on June 20, 2018 that Solitude had agreed to be sold to Alterra. \n\nSolitude is the host for the snowboardcross and ski cross events for the FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2019.\n\nSolitude Resort also operates a nordic center. The Solitude Nordic Center, nestled between the Solitude and Brighton ski areas, offers a variety of nordic sport opportunities, including snowshoeing, skate and classic cross-country skiing. The site's 13 cross-country skiing trails cover twelve miles (almost 20 km) evenly divided between \"easiest\" and \"moderately difficult\", including a long loop of two miles (3 km). Six snowshoe trails cover six miles (ten kilometers). Instruction and training workshops are offered.\n\nNamed a Top 20 Family Ski Resort for two consecutive years, 2007-2008\n\n\n"}

Richter was the newspaper's publisher until 1917. He hired correspondents to report from locales across the United States and continued to publish and edit the \"Sporting Life\" until 1917. Throughout most of its existence, it was in competition with \"The Sporting News\", which was founded in 1886 and published by the Spink brothers in St. Louis.

The film stars Mark Harmon, Jodie Foster, Blair Brown, Jonathan Silverman, Harold Ramis and William McNamara. In the film; Billy Wyatt, a washed-up baseball player, is called back home to collect the ashes of his childhood sweetheart Katie Chandler, who had committed suicide. While doing so, he remembers the relationships he had with her and people he grew up with. \n\n\"Stealing Home\" was released theatrically on August 26, 1988 by Warner Bros. Upon release the film, was a critical and commercial failure, although David Foster's musical score garnered universal praise. Over the years it has attained a cult status, praised for its pace, nostalgic feel and performances. The film holds a 93% rating on Google users aggregation while on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes it holds a rating of 20%.\n\nIn the 1980s, Billy Wyatt (Mark Harmon) is a thirty-something washed up baseball player who now works as a high school groundskeeper, spending his days tending to the field and drinking. One afternoon he receives a phone call informing him that Katie Chandler (Jodie Foster), an old acquaintance, has died.\n\nThe bulk of the film consists of extended flashbacks to the 1960s explaining Billy and Katie's relationship. Katie was a slightly older neighborhood girl who befriended Billy's mother, Ginny (Blair Brown), and who became his babysitter. Katie acts as a mentor to the young Billy, and, as he grows up, gives him advice on women and dating. As Billy ages he begins to develop feelings for Katie, though the rebellious and worldly wise Katie is interested in older men. Nevertheless, the two share a flirtatious relationship, and Katie comes to regard Billy as her closest friend and confidante. One summer in his late teens, Billy's father dies in a car accident, and Katie, Billy, and Ginny go on vacation to recover from the tragedy. While sharing a beach house, Katie encourages Ginny to have a one-night stand. An enraged Billy attacks the man whom she brings home, thinking that having sex with another man so soon is disrespectful to his father's memory. He and Katie argue, but later that night make up and sleep together. The next day, Katie tells Billy that she's leaving the country with a man she's been seeing, intending to live a life of adventure. In voice over narration, Billy recalls that this is the last time he ever saw Katie.\n\nIn the present, Billy visits Katie's family. Her father tells Billy that Katie went through a series of failed and abusive relationships getting married and divorced 4 times and that she had seemed chronically unhappy for some time. Despite apparently rebounding from her most recent breakup, she unexpectedly committed suicide. Katie's father tells Billy that her suicide note requested that Billy be responsible for disposing of her ashes, and entrusts them to Billy.\n\nBilly reunites with his childhood friend Alan Appleby (Harold Ramis), and the two engage in a night of reminiscing and carousing with Katie's ashes while trying to decide what will be the most respectful way to dispose of them. Eventually, Billy recalls a memory of Katie telling him a story about watching an Atlantic City show in which a horse ran down a pier and jumped into the water, admiring the image of freedom it offered her. The next morning, Billy locates the same pier and scatters Katie's ashes there. Seeing a new sense of possibility in his own life, Billy reunites with a former girlfriend and joins a minor league baseball team; the film ends with Billy, his girlfriend, and Appleby celebrating after a game.\n\n\nThe film plot is set in the Philadelphia area and the New Jersey shore. The filming occurred in many locations:\n\nThe film received negative reviews around the time of its release. In her review for the \"New York Times\", Janet Maslin wrote, \"The era is simply established as a dreamily idyllic past, thanks to sand dunes at twilight, waves that crash in the distance, shiny red convertibles without seat belts and a musical score that may make you want to weep, for all the wrong reasons\". In his one-star review for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert wrote, \"I detested \"Stealing Home\" so much, from beginning to end, that I left the screening wondering if any movie could possibly be that bad\". The movie currently holds a 22% Critics rating and a 78% Audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nWhen asked about the film in 2006, Mark Harmon said, \"That was about a bunch of actors loving a script, going there and burning it on both ends for five weeks just to get it done. That was a fun one to make. I hear a lot about that role. People really found that movie on video.\"\n\nEver since the release of \"Summer of '42\", Warner Bros. has attempted to buy back the rights to the film, which they sold to author Herman Raucher in lieu of paying him for the script, under the belief that the film would not be financially successful. \"Stealing Home\" was greenlit shortly after Raucher denied their latest attempt to purchase the rights, leading to \"Summer\" star Jennifer O'Neill's assertion that \"Stealing Home\" was \"stolen\" from \"Summer\". Regardless, she said that she enjoyed the movie and called it a \"lovely film.\" Rita Kempley, in her review for the \"Washington Post,\" also saw similarities with \"Summer\", describing the film as a \"pale comedy-drama by mediocrities Steven Kampmann and Will Aldis. Admittedly a pastiche of their memories, the movie bespeaks the dust of '60s yearbooks and greeting card sentiment. Of course, that stuff can be touching (\"Summer of '42\") or quirky (\"Gregory's Girl\"), but here only allergy sufferers will leave with soggy Kleenex.\"\n\n"}
