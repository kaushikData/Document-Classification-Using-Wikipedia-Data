{"id": "8192330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8192330", "title": "Foot hockey", "text": "Foot hockey\n\nFoot hockey (also known as Hocker) is a sport related to hockey in which the only equipment is a ball, most commonly a tennis ball, that is kicked about the playing surface by the players in an attempt to score a goal on the opposing goaltender. It has been described as a \"combination of hockey, soccer and handball\" and \"a form of soccer with a tennis ball\". Foot hockey is played indoors or outdoors; footwear is optional indoors, but must be worn by either all or none of the players. It may be unisex or coed. Participation in foot hockey produced fewer catastrophic injuries than other winter sports in studies from 1986 to 1995.\n\nThe game is mostly played in grade schools, and is popular in Canada and parts of the United States. The usual age of foot hockey players can range from 6 to 13 years old. Because it has few requirements regarding equipment and can be played on most hard surfaces, it is more accessible than ice hockey. The game is listed amongst those to keep children interested in playground activities in the 1915 issue of \"The Playground\" published by the Playground Association of America. In his book \"Brian Mcfarlane's NHL Hockey 1984\", Brian McFarlane mentions how brothers Joe and Brian Mullen played the game as kids in arena stairwells while waiting for ice time at the rink. Anson Carter's introduction to ice hockey was a game of foot hockey played in his hometown of Scarborough, Ontario when he was a child. Neal Broten played the game in his family's kitchen with his brothers.\n\nA variant of the game, called \"Sockey\", is commonly played among elementary school children in Southwestern Quebec. Unlike the Ontario version, Sockey is most commonly played on outdoor hockey rinks in Fall and Spring using a soccer ball, designating specific board panels as \"nets\" and full body contact is permitted. Another variant of the game still called Foot Hockey, is played by children ranging from age 6 to 13. The version is played Southern and Eastern Ontario. The nets are either coats or the patterns among the walls, in this version players are allowed to move the ball with their feet and hands (by throwing it to each other) but must be kicked with their foot. Semi-Body contact is commonly allowed and the goalies commonly use baseball caps as gloves.\n\nThere is one net at each end with one goaltender. The common goaltending equipment are jackets that are wore on backwards and untied so the ball does not hurt as it normally would, and in addition it is advantage as it covers up more of the net. After their goalie has possession of the ball he or she, can throw the ball, or kick down the court to one of their players. This sport is often played on asphalt or grass .\n\nAs in ice hockey, the goaltender is an individual who guards the net, in this case a makeshift area whose width is demarcated with available markers on the ground, such as the player's coats or snow piles. The net's dimensions vary but are generally 4 to wide and approximately 2 to high. The goaltender may use a jacket or hat in order to stop the ball. A variation played outdoors is boot hockey, played in the winter when most players are likely to be wearing boots, and is a form of shinny; the term \"boot hockey\" also refers to a variant of street hockey.\n\nThe rules are a mixture of those for ice hockey or floor hockey and soccer. The primary equipment is a ball, usually a tennis ball, though any suitable object may be used; sticks are not used. Each player may kick the ball, either in an attempt to score a goal by sending the ball past the goaltender into the net, by passing the ball to a teammate, or by advancing the ball into the opponents territory and chasing it. Some variants will forgo a goaltender.\n\nPlayers are allowed to use their hands to catch the ball, in the event that it is in the air, but are not allowed to pick it up off the ground. If a player does catch a ball, he or she is able to throw or place it on the ground, but only to themselves. In other words, the ball cannot be hand passed to another player, or thrown into the net.\n\nIn organised events, helmets may be required, and is recommended by some. The game is considered to be a safe sport.\n\nOne of the important rules is interference. If the goalie is kicked or pushed it is an interference and the team which was interfered is granted the ball and is no goal if it enters the net. There are also interferences during out of net play. The common playground interference is when people that aren't playing run into the way of the ball. The consequences differ for this sort of affair from a penalty shot to the interfered teams position. Arguing can be a big matter too. The majority of goaltenders tend to argue about disallowing goals, if it is interference, or them just claiming the ball never hit the net. In this case some will argue so much that the players will use an alternate method and give them a penalty shot. During a penalty shot players can call rebounds or no rebounds. Without rebounds it is an advantage for the defending team. They may also call slides or no slides. A slide is when the goalie charges towards the player taking the penalty shot and blocking the ball with their body.\n\nFor Christmas 2001, Danièle Sauvageau, head coach of the Canada women's national ice hockey team from 2000 to 2002, and video editor Ryan Jankowski prepared a video named \"Just Smile\" given as part of a Christmas package to each of the players. Among other events, it documented a game of foot hockey between the players, which was described by Sally Manning in her book \"A golden tear: Danièle Sauvageau's journey to Olympic gold\" as a favourite warm-up for the team.\n\nJim Kelly, a quarterback in the National Football League in the 1980s and 1990s, played foot hockey with neighbourhood children as a child. US politician Tim Pawlenty played a variant of boot hockey as a child.\n\n"}

They are most often found in circuit training gyms.\n\nHydraulic circuit training machines were first developed for The Henley Corporation in the 1970s, and are now becoming an increasingly popular form of exercise. \n\nThe fundamental principles behind these designs are based on fluid dynamics: Force that is applied at one point is transmitted to another point using an incompressible fluid known as hydraulic oil.\n\nFor circuit training applications, each piece of equipment is specifically designed for a given exercise. The effort is applied through the range of motion of the exercise acts on a lever against a piston which moves linearly within a hydraulic cylinder. The cylinder is filled with hydraulic oil which is displaced by the motion of the piston, and is allowed to flow to the opposite side of the piston through an adjustable orifice.\n\nResistance to the motion is determined by the amount of effort applied and the adjustment size of the orifice. This is a key feature of this design and allows the resistance to be adjusted to an individual's strength level.\n"}
{"id": "554117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=554117", "title": "Indoor cricket", "text": "Indoor cricket\n\nIndoor cricket is a variant of and shares many basic concepts with cricket. The game is most often played between two teams each consisting of six or eight players.\n\nSeveral versions of the game have been in existence since the late 1960s, whilst the game in its present form began to take shape in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nConventional cricket has been played indoors at Docklands Stadium in Melbourne, Australia. The codified sport of indoor cricket is not to be confused with conventional cricket played indoors, or with other modified versions of cricket played indoors (see other forms of indoor cricket below).\n\nIn terms of the concept of the game indoor cricket is similar to cricket. Like its outdoor cousin, indoor cricket involves two batsmen, a bowler and a team of fielders. The bowler \"bowls\" the ball to the batsmen who must score runs. The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins. Despite these basic similarities, the game itself differs significantly from its traditional counterpart in several ways, most notably on the field of play and the means by which runs are obtained.\n\nJust like every other sport, warm ups and stretching is a must.\nAs a minimum, every player, including the fielders have to wear an abdominal guard (box), with the person bowling the ball as an exception.\nThe batsman are required to play batting gloves, primarily for preventing the bat from slipping out of the hands. indoor batting gloves are readily available at cricket stores, however some indoor cricket facilities also provide basic non-slip gloves that can be shared during the game.\nSome players prefer to use hard ball batting gloves to prevent their hands from serious injury, as the indoor cricket ball can cause serious damage.\nOne optional security gadget is the safety goggles, like the ones used in squash, to prevent any serious injury to the eyes.\nAs the game speed is usually very fast and the play really rigorous, its is a demanding cardiovascular activity. It is recommended to have a doctor checkup before taking up indoor cricket, especially in advance age and/or with any medical conditions.\nRemember, it's fielders right of way when a shot is played, so the batsman/fielder has to be watchful to avoid collisions. \nBe mindful of the fact that indoor cricket cause more sporting injuries than casual outdoor cricket, due to the proximity of the ball and fielders. Therefore, a sports/team insurance is very important. Some indoor sports facilities provide these insurances as part of the indoor tournaments.\n\nThe length of an indoor cricket pitch is the same as a conventional cricket pitch, and has 3 stumps at each end, but there the similarities end. The arena is completely enclosed by tight netting, a few metres from each side and end of the pitch. The playing surface is normally artificial grass matting. Whilst the pitch is the same length, however, the batsmen do not have to run the entire length. The striker's crease is in the regulation place in front of the stumps, but the non-striker's crease is only halfway down the pitch.\n\nIndoor cricket is played between 2 teams of 8 players. Each player must bowl 2 eight ball overs, and bat in a partnership for 4 overs. A faster version of the game exists, where each side is reduced to 6 players and each innings lasts 12 overs instead of 16.\n\nThe stumps used in indoor cricket are not, for obvious reasons, stuck in the ground. Instead, they are collapsible spring-loaded stumps that immediately spring back to the standing position when knocked over. The ball used in indoor cricket is a modified cricket ball, with a softer centre. The ball also differs in that it is yellow to make it more obvious to see indoors against varied backgrounds. Both traditional outdoor cricket bats or more specialised lighter-weight indoor cricket bats may be used. The gloves are typically lightweight cotton with no protective padding on the outside. The palm-side of the gloves usually have embedded rubber dots to aid grip.\n\nScoring in indoor cricket is dived into 4 types: physical runs, bonus runs, the usual extras/sundries and penalty-minus runs. Physical runs are scored by both batsmen completing a run from one crease to the other. Bonus runs are scored when the ball hits a net. Bonus scores for particular parts of the nets follow:\nNB: For bonus runs to be scored, at least one physical run must be scored. The bonus runs are then added to the physical runs. For example, a batsman strikes the ball, hitting the back net on the full (6) and makes one physical run, for a total of 7 runs.\nExtras/sundries are the same as those in formal cricket and consist of wides, no balls etcetera.\nPenalty-minus runs are the set number of runs deducted from a team’s score for each dismissal.\n\nA batsman can be dismissed in the same ways they can be in conventional cricket – with variations in the case of LBW and mankad (see below) – and with the exception of \"timed out\". When a batsman gets dismissed, however, five runs are deducted from their total and they continue to bat. Batsmen bat in pairs for 4 overs at a time, irrespective of whether they are dismissed. A player can also be \"caught\" by a ball rebounding off a net, except off a \"six\", as long as it has not previously touched the ground. This negates any physical or bonus runs that might have been awarded.\n\nA method of dismissal in indoor cricket that is far more prevalent than its outdoor counterpart is the mankad. A mankad is given out if the bowler completes their bowling action without releasing the ball, breaks the stumps at their end without letting go of the ball and the non-striker is out of their ground.\n\nWhilst lbw is a valid form of dismissal in indoor cricket, it is a far rarer occurrence in indoor than it is in outdoor cricket. A batsman can only be dismissed lbw if he does not offer a shot and the umpire is satisfied that the ball would then have hit the stumps.\n\nIndoor cricket is officiated by one umpire who is situated outside of the playing area at the strike batsmen's end of the court. The umpire sits or stands on a raised platform that is usually 3 metres above ground level. Secondary officials (such as scorers or video umpires) have sometimes been utilised in national or international competition.\n\nThe team with the higher score at the conclusion of each innings is declared the winner of the match. The second innings continues for a full 16 overs even if the batting side passes the first innings total due to the possibility of a side finishing behind a total even after they have surpassed it (see dismissals above).\n\nIn most cases indoor cricket is played according to a skins system, where the batting partnerships from each innings are compared against one another and the higher of the two is deemed to have won the skin. For example, the second batting partnership in the first innings might score 5 runs whilst the second partnership in the second innings scores 10 – the latter would be deemed to have won the skin. The team that has won the greater of the four skins available is often awarded the win if the totals are tied.\n\nMost indoor cricket centres employ a dot ball rule, where the scoreboard has to change at least every third ball. This means if the batsmen play 2 consecutive balls without a change in the scorecard (applies on multiple batsmen over multiple over), the scorecard has to change on the 3rd ball. It can be changed by batsman scoring a run, extra runs or in the case where a run is not scored on the 3rd consecutive ball, the batsman is declared out and 5 runs deducted off the score, hence changing the scorecard.\n\nSome indoor leagues have the first or last ball of a 'Skin' declared a jackpot ball. This means any runs scored on the jackpot ball will be doubled. e.g. if a '7' is hit, it will counted as 14 runs and if a wicket is lost, it will be counted as minus 10 runs.\n\nIndoor cricket is typically played either as a six- or eight-a-side match, and with six- or eight-ball overs respectively. The game can be played in men's, women's and mixed competitions. Permutations of the game include bonus overs (where the bonus score is double, dismissals result in seven (7) runs (cf. five (5) runs) being deducted from the team score and fielding restrictions removed.)\n\nTest indoor cricket is the highest standard of indoor cricket and is played between members of the World Indoor Cricket Federation.\n\nThe first international Test matches were played between Australia and New Zealand in 1985. Those sides have since been joined on the international stage by England (1990), South Africa (1991), Zimbabwe (1998), Namibia (1998), India (2000), Pakistan (2000), Sri Lanka (2002), United Arab Emirates (2004), Wales (2007), France (2007), Guernsey (2007), Singapore (2013), Malaysia (2017).\n\nTest matches are usually played in a group of matches called a \"series\" featuring two to four nations. These series can consist of three to five matches and where more than two nations are involved, may also include a finals series. Matches played at World Cup events are also considered Test matches.\n\nInternational competition is also organised for juniors and masters age groups. The matches are considered Test matches within their respective divisions.\n\nSince 1985, most Test series between Australia and New Zealand have played for the Trans Tasman trophy. Similarly, since 1990, Test series between Australia and England have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes, a name borrowed from the trophy contested by the same nations in outdoor cricket.\n\nEach member nation of the WICF usually holds its own national titles. In Australia, states and territories compete in the Australian Indoor Cricket Championships (as well as the now defunct National League).\n\nThe national competition in New Zealand is referred to as the Tri Series and is contested by three provinces – Northern, Central and Southern.\n\nNational championships contested elsewhere in the world include South Africa's National Championship and England's National League.\n\nIn addition to social competition played throughout the world there are several state leagues and competitions within each nation. Various states, provinces or geographical areas organise their own state championships (referred to in Australia as \"Superleague\" – not to be confused with the ill-fated Rugby League competition). Various districts, centres or arenas take part in these competitions.\n\nThe Indoor Cricket World cup was first held in Birmingham, England in 1995 and has run every two or three years since. The event usually also features age-group, masters' and women's competitions. The last World Cup was held in Wellington (NZ) in October 2014. Australia came first in the boys', girls', women's and men's competitions. Australia has won all 9 Open Men World Cup titles (since 1995) and all 8 Open World Cup titles (since 1998).\n\nThe first significant example of organised indoor cricket took place, somewhat unusually, in Germany. A tournament was held under the auspices of the Husum Cricket Club in a hall in Flensburg in the winter of 1968–69.\n\nIt was not until the 1970s that the game began to take shape as a codified sport. Conceived as a way of keeping cricketers involved during the winter months, various six-a-side leagues were formed throughout England in the first half of the decade, eventually leading to the first national competition held in March 1976 at the Sobell Center in Islington. This distinct form of indoor cricket is still played today.\n\nDespite the early popularity of the sport in England, a different version of indoor cricket developed by two different parties in Perth, Western Australia in the late 1970s evolved into the sport known as indoor cricket today. Against the backdrop of the upheaval in the conventional game caused by World Series Cricket, torrential rain and a desire to keep their charges active led cricket school administrators Dennis Lillee and Graeme Monaghan to set up netted arenas indoors. Concurrently, entrepreneurs Paul Hanna and Michael Jones began creating an eight-a-side game that eventually led to the nationwide franchise known as Indoor Cricket Arenas (ICA). It was not long before hundreds of ICA-branded stadiums were set up throughout Australia, leading to the first national championships held in 1984 at a time where over 200,000 people were estimated to be participating in the sport.\n\nNations may either be full members or associate members of the WICF. Each member nation has its own national body which regulates matches played in its country. The national bodies are responsible for selecting representatives for its national side and organising home and away internationals for the side.\n\nConventional cricket matches have taken place at covered venues (usually featuring a retractable roof) and can thus be regarded as cricket being played indoors. Such matches are relatively infrequent and come with added complications in the event that the ball makes contact with the roof while in play.\n\nA version of indoor cricket (bearing greater resemblance to conventional cricket) is played exclusively in the United Kingdom. This variant sees the six players on each team utilise the same playing and protective equipment that can be found in outdoor cricket, and is played in indoor facilities that differ greatly from the international form of indoor cricket.\n\nDespite lacking international competition, this form of indoor cricket enjoys a strong following in the UK, and, like its international counterpart, enjoys the support of the ECB\n\n\nNational Bodies\n\nAustralian State Bodies\n\nNew Zealand Provincial Bodies\n\nOther Links\n"}

They were both home fields of the team now known as the Chicago Cubs of the National League. Both parks hosted baseball championships. The latter of the two parks, where the franchise played for nearly a quarter century, was the home of the first two world champion Cubs teams ( and ), the team that posted the best winning percentage in Major League Baseball history and won the most games in National League history (), the only cross-town World Series in Chicago (1906), and the immortalized Tinker to Evers to Chance double-play combo. Both ballparks were what are now called \"wooden\" ballparks.\n\nThe initial stadium was the club's home beginning in , succeeding Lakefront Park. Although the park's useful life turned out to be as short as the ball club's stay at the Lakefront (seven years), it was also memorable, as the team won back-to-back National League pennants in its first two seasons there.\n\nThe park was located on a small block bounded by Congress, Loomis, Harrison and Throop Streets, with the diamond toward its western end. The elongated shape of the block lent a bathtub-like shape to the park, with foul lines reportedly as short as 216 feet. The stadium held roughly 10,000 fans. In addition to the diamond, the park held a bicycle track which encircled the playing field, at the height of the contemporary bicycle craze.\n\nThe Cubs (then known as the White Stockings) had had to secure a new property after , and it took longer than anticipated. The season began on April 30, a month later than it does today, for a 112-game schedule, 50 fewer games than today's major-league schedule. The club spent the first five-plus weeks of the 1885 season on the road and the park was finally opened on June 6 with a victory over the St. Louis Maroons, late of the Union Association. Despite being \"wanderers\" early in the season, the powerful Chicago club, under player-manager Cap Anson, came home with an 18-6 record. They would sweep a four-game set in their first homestand and romp through the league schedule, finishing at 87-25. The only team that gave them any problem was the New York Giants, who won 10 of the clubs' 16 meetings and finished just two games behind Chicago in the standings. If projected to a modern 162-game schedule, that translates to 125 and 123 wins, respectively, in a very lopsided league (the third-place club finished 30 games back).\n\nChicago captured the National League pennant that season and also went on to win the league crown in 1886. The site saw postseason action those two years, as the White Stockings squared off in 19th-century World Series play against the St. Louis Cardinals, then playing in the rival American Association and known as the St. Louis Browns. The championships of the 1880s were disorganized in comparison to the modern World Series, exemplified by the 1885 contest, which ended in dispute with no clear winner. The 1886 World Series was more conventional, and was won by the Browns. Those matchups were the first on-field confrontations of the Cubs and Cardinals clubs, which remains one of baseball's strongest rivalries today.\n\nThe site also saw \"bonus baseball\" in 1887, as a neutral site for Game 14 of that year's unique 15-game \"traveling\" World Series between the Browns and the Detroit Wolverines. In 1891 the team split its schedule between West Side Park and South Side Park. The first West Side Park was abandoned after the 1891 season, with the team playing at home exclusively on the South Side in 1892.\n\nThe site of the first West Side Park is now occupied by the Andrew Jackson Language Academy, whose address is 1340 West Harrison.\n\nIn May 1893, the club opened the second West Side Park a few blocks west-southwest of the first one, on a larger block bounded by Taylor, Wood, Polk and Lincoln (now Wolcott) Streets. It was located at . During May and June, they split their 1893 schedule with South Side Park, playing Sunday games on the West Side and weekday games on the South Side. By mid-summer they had abandoned the South Side park and moved into the West Side park full-time.\n\nHome plate for this ballpark was in the northwest corner of the property, toward the Polk and Lincoln intersection. The right field fence paralleled Taylor, with flat apartments between the alley behind the right field area, and Taylor itself. There were also flats across Wood Street to the east, behind left field, giving the park (for a few years, at least) a degree of the ambiance that Wrigley Field would later be famous for. Cook County Hospital was across the street to the north, behind third base. Like the first West Side ballpark, the new facility was restricted by the streets around it, creating a rectangular playing area.\n\nThe field layout was reported in the \"Inter Ocean\" on April 16, 1893: \"The diamond is 90 feet from the grand stand, and the right and left field fences are 340 feet from the home plate, 130 feet further than the old west side fence. The distance from the home plate to the extreme center field is 560 feet. The club will play all their Sunday games at the new grounds during the World's Fair, and after the fair is closed will probably play all their games there.\"\n\nAn artist's conception of the new field includes a rooftop tier of private seating on the grandstand, and roofed bleachers beyond first and third base. Photographs from the early 1900s suggest those plans were left dormant until starting in 1905, when the team began playing well and expansion of the ballpark seating was begun.\n\nAlthough the 340-560-340 sounds symmetrical, the left field side was much more spacious, and the distance to center was actually very deep left-center, possibly the far corner of the property.\n\nThe original layout of the park sat about 12,500 patrons. As with other parks of the era, fans were often permitted to stand along the outer perimeter of the playing field itself. When the team began playing winning ball under Frank Chance, overflow crowds became more frequent.\n\nOn August 5, 1894, during its first full season as home to the Cubs (at that point known as the Colts), West Side Park suffered severe damage from fire during a game against the Cincinnati Reds. As the fire spread through the first-base side stands, panicked fans trying to escape pressed up against the barbed wire fence separating them from the playing field. Only quick action by several players in wrenching the fence open averted a major tragedy. The burnt stands were simply roped off, and the season resumed the next day, with the burnt area fenced off, and the spectators sitting on the left side of the diamond. Despite that near-disaster, the club rebuilt the burnt portion out of wood.\n\nOne highlight, albeit for the visitors, occurred on July 13, 1896, when Philadelphia Phillies outfielder/firstbaseman Ed Delahanty smacked four home runs in one game, only the second player to do so. In contrast to Bobby Lowe's feat two years earlier, which was aided by a short foul line, two of Delahanty's were inside-the-park. After Delahanty's third, center fielder Bill Lange drew a laugh by calling \"time\", stationing himself in deep-deep center, near the clubhouse, seemingly a mile away, and then waving the pitcher to continue. Delahanty then got the laugh on Lange by knocking it between the clubhouse and the fence, again circling the bases while Lange scurried for the ball. The normally partisan home fans cheered Delahanty's effort. Chicago got the last laugh, winning the game, 9–8.\n\nAs the park entered the new century, it featured a small covered grandstand behind home plate. Behind the home plate stands, the team and ticket offices were housed in a fairly ornate two-story brick building topped with statues of baseball players. Uncovered bleachers extended along both foul lines and into left field. Beyond left-center field, the bleachers gave way to a small clubhouse. The right-field bleachers were only nine rows deep, sitting underneath a free-standing billboard that ran above the length of the bleachers. The billboard frequently featured large ads for the sports pages and the sportswriters of local newspapers such as the \"Chicago Tribune\" and the \"Chicago Daily News\". A scoreboard was located on the extreme right end of the billboard, toward the right field corner. Much like today at Wrigley Field, several of the rooftops beyond the outfield bleachers offered bleacher seating of their own, at least for a few years.\n\nThe second West Side Park was the home of the Cubs' most successful teams of the 20th century. From 1906 through 1910, the Cubs won four National League pennants and two World Series championships. The 1906 World Series between the Cubs and the Chicago White Sox featured the first cross-town matchup in Series history. Although the Cubs had one of the most successful seasons in major league history, winning 116 contests against just 36 losses, they were defeated by the light-hitting White Sox four games to two. The Cubs finally brought a championship to West Side Park the following year when they swept the Detroit Tigers after ending the first contest in a tie. In 1908, West Side Park became the home of the first repeat world champions when the Cubs again bested the Tigers. After a one-year absence, the Cubs returned to the Series in 1910, only to lose in five games to the Philadelphia Athletics. The 1908 championship \nturned out to be the franchise's last World Series championship until 2016, ending a staggering 108-year drought for the franchise.\n\nThe ballpark expanded with the club's rising fortunes. For 1905, several rows of private box seats were built on top of the original grandstand roof behind home plate. That same year saw the construction of a new two-story brick clubhouse structure, fronted by columns, out in far left-center. After just two seasons, jury-box bleachers were built directly in front of and over the clubhouse. During the 1908 season, the bleachers along the first and third-base lines were gradually covered and topped by more private box seating.\n\nBy the early 1910s the wooden ballpark was showing its age, in large part due to neglect by Charles Murphy, the unpopular owner of the Cubs (one of whose alternate, media-driven nicknames was the unflattering \"Murphy's Spuds\"). In 1910, the neighborhood view beyond the nearby right field bleachers was blocked off by an enormous billboard. In 1912, the more distant left field view was similarly obstructed by a large billboard, which also served as the new scoreboard. The enclosure of the park was completed with the installment of billboards in dead center. At this time, the jury box bleachers in left-center field were removed, adding to the new claustrophobic feel of the outfield. With gambling becoming an increasing problem in baseball, starting in 1911 the playing field was adorned with large signs (as with some other major league ballparks) reminding both fans and players, \"No Betting Allowed.\" Additionally, the dilapidated park found itself competing unsuccessfully with new steel-and-concrete baseball venues. The Chicago White Sox inaugurated Comiskey Park in 1910. Four years later, the upstart Federal League placed a franchise on the North Side and began play in Weeghman Park. By 1915, the Cubs were the third most popular team in a three-team city.\n\nWhen the Federal League collapsed after the 1915 season, Charles Weeghman, owner of the now-defunct Chicago Whales, was allowed to buy a substantial interest in the Cubs. One of his first acts was to abandon West Side Park and move the Cubs to Weeghman Park for the 1916 season. Weeghman Park survives today as Wrigley Field.\n\nOne of the few items the Cubs took with them, besides normal operational properties, was a set of large letters comprising a sign that had run across the back of the grandstand and was to be read from the outside of the park: \"\". This sign was placed along the top of the Weeghman Park wall bordering Sheffield Avenue, visible to everyone in the park, and of course reading \"backwards\" to the spectators. This oddity lasted a few years at Weeghman / Cubs Park until it was brought down during an early remodeling.\n\nWest Side Park continued to host semipro and amateur baseball events for a few years. It even served as a setting for \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West\", thus converting the entire former ballfield into a different kind of \"bull pen\". The ballpark was torn down in 1920. Murphy, who still owned the property, sold the leftover lumber for scrap. He sold the property itself to the University of Illinois. The site is now occupied by the University of Illinois Medical Center.\n\nThis West Side Park was the only park that witnessed the Cubs as World Series Champions from 1908 to 2016. The Cubs won back-to-back titles here in 1907 and 1908. In June 1909, a flag-raising ceremony was held, celebrating the Cubs second consecutive World Series. Newspaper reporters commented that the crowd seemed less enthused than they had the previous summer, as if they were getting complacent.\n\n\n"}
