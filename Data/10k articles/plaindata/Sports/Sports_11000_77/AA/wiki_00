{"id": "188959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188959", "title": "Charterhouse School", "text": "Charterhouse School\n\nCharterhouse is an independent day and boarding school in Godalming, Surrey. Founded by Thomas Sutton in 1611 on the site of the old Carthusian monastery in Charterhouse Square, Smithfield, London, it educates over 800 pupils, aged 13 to 18 years, and is one of the original Great Nine English public schools. Today pupils are still referred to as Carthusians, and ex-pupils as Old Carthusians.\n\nCharterhouse charges full boarders up to £39,165 per annum (2018/19) and is among the most expensive Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) schools in the UK. It has educated one British Prime Minister and has a long list of notable alumni.\n\nThe school has admitted girls to the Specialists (Sixth Form) since 1971. In 2017, it announced that it is to move to full co-education from the age of 13, and will admit girls into Year 9 from September 2021. There will be girls in every year group from September 2023.\n\nIn May 1611, the London Charterhouse came into the hands of Thomas Sutton (1532–1611) of Knaith, Lincolnshire. He acquired a fortune by the discovery of coal on two estates which he had leased near Newcastle-on-Tyne, and afterwards, removing to London, he carried on a commercial career. In 1611, the year of his death, he endowed a hospital on the site of the Charterhouse, calling it the hospital of King James, and in his will he bequeathed moneys to maintain a chapel, hospital (almshouse) and school. He died on 12 December and subsequently the will was hotly contested but upheld in court, and the foundation was finally constituted to afford a home for eighty male pensioners (gentlemen by descent and in poverty, soldiers that have borne arms by sea or land, merchants decayed by piracy or shipwreck, or servants in household to the King or Queens Majesty), and to educate forty boys.\nCharterhouse established a reputation for excellence in hospital care and treatment, thanks in part to Henry Levett, an Oxford graduate who joined the school as a physician in 1712. Levett was widely esteemed for his medical writings, including an early tract on the treatment of smallpox. Levett was buried in Charterhouse Chapel and his widow married Andrew Tooke, the master of Charterhouse.\n\nThe school was moved to its present site in 1872 by the then headmaster, the Reverend William Haig Brown – a decision influenced by the findings of the Clarendon Commission of 1864.\n\nThe school bought a 68-acre (270,000 m²) site atop a hill just outside Godalming. In addition to the main school buildings (designed by architect Philip Charles Hardwick), they constructed three boarding houses, known as Saunderites (once the headmaster's house, pronounced \"sarnderites\" rather than \"sornderites\"), Verites and Gownboys (for scholars, who were entitled to wear gowns). The school was built by Lucas Brothers, who also built the Royal Albert Hall and Covent Garden.\n\nAs pupil numbers grew, other houses were built alongside the approach road, now known as Charterhouse Hill. Each was titled with an adaptation of the name of their first housemaster, such as Weekites, Daviesites and Girdlestoneites. The last of these is still referred to as Duckites, reflecting the unusual gait of its original housemaster, even though he retired well over 100 years ago. There are now the original four 'old' houses plus eight 'new' houses, making twelve boarding houses in total. The twelve Houses have preserved a unique identity (each with its own tie and colours) and pupils compete against each other in both sports and the arts.\n\nThe school continued to expand over the 20th century. Further land was bought to the north and west, increasing the grounds to over 200 acres (809,000 m²), and a new school chapel was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (perhaps best known for designing the red telephone box) and consecrated in 1927 to commemorate almost 700 pupils who died in the First World War, making it the largest war memorial in England. Around 350 names have been subsequently added to commemorate those who died in the Second World War and other more recent conflicts. Most still attend a short chapel service there six times a week. The school also keeps a small archives library opposite the History block, where it is traditional for Fourths (Year 9) to do an archives project about a particular Old Carthusian killed in the First World War.\n\nAn addition to the campus was seven new Houses, built in the 1970s, replacing late Victorian boarding houses which were demolished in 1977. Other newer buildings include the Art Studio, the John Derry Technology Centre, the Ben Travers Theatre, the Ralph Vaughan Williams Music Centre, the Halford Hewitt Golf Course, the Queen's Sports Centre, the Sir Greville Spratt athletics track and Chetwynd, a hall of residence for girls. In 2003, the School renovated its onsite Library. 2006 saw the opening of The Beveridge Centre for the Social Sciences. In 2007, a £3m Modern Languages building was completed.\n\nThe school has a top 60 placing in the A level league tables, and in 2011 over 80% of pupils are awarded an A* or A grade at GCSE. In 2009, the school announced its decision to switch from A Levels to the International Baccalaureate and Cambridge Pre-U. In 2012 Charterhouse had its best set of Cambridge Pre-U results with 96% of examinations taken awarded Distinction or Merit grades. Seventy-eight pupils achieved Distinctions (or their A level equivalent) in all subjects taken and twenty-one achieved the equivalent of A level A* grades in all their subjects. Twenty pupils were offered places at Oxford or Cambridge.\n\nIn 2007, Roy Hattersley, former Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and minister, reported on a visit to Charterhouse in the Guardian newspaper. After describing his impression that \"[The chapel]'s geometric spires and minarets proclaim complete confidence that Charterhouse educates men who are destined to rule the universe\", he said: \"Academically and pastorally, it is near to beyond criticism. And after only a brief glimpse of the school, I have no doubt that I would have been ecstatically happy there. But its existence allows the rich and the powerful to ignore the world beyond its boundaries.\" He therefore concluded that his aspiration to abolish private education in the 1970s was \"totally justified\".\n\nThe 2009 Ofsted Social Care Inspection Report noted that 'The provision for \"Helping children achieve well and enjoy what they do\" is rated as outstanding.' and 'This is a good school, in which boarders' welfare is promoted by a strong approach to countering bullying and child protection. Boarding staff have good relationships with the boarders, and boarders can list a range of people who they can talk to if they are worried or have concerns.'\n\nThe 2011 Independent Schools Inspectorate Report noted that 'The quality of pupils' achievements is excellent. Pupils are extremely well educated. They attain extremely high standards in external examinations and make exceptional progress in their learning because of their positive attitudes to study, dedicated and often inspiring teaching, and an academically challenging curriculum that is adapted to suit all needs. The curriculum is enriched by an outstanding range of activities'.\n\nThe 2017 ISI Educational Quality Inspection Report noted that ‘Pupils' academic and other achievements are high and often exceptional. Pupils' successes in external competitions, in academic distinctions and in sport, music and the creative and aesthetic arts are exceptional. Pupils' social development is outstanding. Pupils are polite, courteous and respectful of one another and of the adults who care for them. Relationships between pupils and staff are excellent. Pupils mature into independent and self-motivated pupils over the course of their time at school and are extremely well prepared, not only for the next stage of their lives, but also to contribute to society at large.’\n\nIn 2017 the school announced that it is moving to full co-education from the age of 13, and will welcome the first girls into Year 9 in September 2021. There will be girls in every year group from September 2023.\n\nThere are three academic terms (known as Quarters) in the year,\n\nThere are four old boarding houses and eight new houses in White List (a directory of names) order. In Charterhouse vocabulary an \"old\" house is one which was founded in the early years of the school, as opposed to the \"new\" houses which were created later and are situated away from the main school. They are all distinguished by the colour of the pupils' ties, umbrellas and football team's stripes.\n\nThe newest house, Fletcherites, named after Frank Fletcher, a former headmaster, was opened in autumn 2010 for sixth-form pupils. The house moved into the old Great Comp building, now renovated.\nVerites, Saunderites and Gownboys houses predate the move to Godalming in 1872 and are known as the \"block\" houses. However, Girdlestoneites is now treated as one of the \"old houses\" because it, along with Verites, Saunderites and Gownboys, are the only houses still in their 1870s buildings, while all the rest are in their 1970s replacements. Saunderites is named after its first Housemaster Dr. Saunders (Headmaster 1832–53) and it was the Headmaster's house, in that the headmaster would not only run the school but one of the houses. Unfortunately, the dramatic increase in the size of the school and the increasing difficulties in running such a school have meant that the Headmaster can no longer do this. Gownboys was named not after their original housemaster, but because it was the scholars' house, although scholars were distributed across all the houses after the transfer to Godalming. As was tradition, scholars wore gowns with their uniform and were treated as superior to other boys. There is no longer such a tradition and the scholars are now distributed throughout the various houses, on a random but numerically equal basis. There are still scholars in Gownboys, but in no greater proportion than any other house.\n\nVerites is a contraction of Oliverites (Oliver Walford, School Usher 1838–55) and hence 'Verites' is pronounced as if the 'Ver' is from Oliver not as from 'very'. The records of the house run back to the start of the last century, but previously it was just called 'Boarders House No.2'. Girdlestonites' first housemaster was Frederick Girdlestone, who was said to walk like a duck. Girdlestonites has therefore been unofficially known as 'Duckites' ever since, but since this was 'insulting' slang it was never written down or used officially. This latter restriction has now largely fallen by the wayside and even the school magazine uses \"Duckites\" in print occasionally.\n\nAll new Houses apart from Bodeites are named after their founders (although Robinites was originally Robinsonites). Bodeites was originally Buissonites, named after the Head of Languages at the time. He ran off with the matron, and so the house was renamed Bodeites after the replacement, Mr Bode. This did lead to some confusion at the time of naming the houses because some housemasters moved to houses named after their colleagues.\n\nRobinites was a 'back passage house' when the school first moved to Godalming and boys stayed there for no more than two years until they could be transferred to one of the other houses. It now has normal status. There was also another passage house known as Laleham, but this has ceased to exist.\n\nAll pupils belong to one of the 12 houses, and boarding boys will sleep in the boarding house; their housemaster will live in \"private side\" attached to the house. Charterhouse has traditionally had very few day boys. In the 1870s the statutes of the school limited them to 10 (excluding sons of masters) and even in the late 1980s the number was only around 25 (some of whom were the sons of masters). Boarding girls are assigned a House and are fully involved in House life but at night, they sleep in halls of residence (e.g. Chetwynd) which are not treated as houses. These halls of residence are more modern than the 'new' Houses.\n\nTeachers belong to \"Brooke Hall\" (the teachers' common room building).\n\n\"Uskites\" was a temporary house opened in 1872 by Mr Stewart, the writing and chemistry instructor from the old Charterhouse. It was closed in 1878 and the pupils redistributed. The building itself (on Peperharow Road) was bought by a schoolmaster, and later used by the School as a sanatorium. It is now masters' accommodation. Mr Stewart named the house because he likened the valley of the River Wey (where the house lies) with the valley of the River Usk.\n\nMemorial Chapel, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and consecrated in 1927, commemorates the Carthusians who died in action: 700 in World War I and 350 in World War II. The whole School meets here three days each week for a short service at 8:30 am, and on Sundays for Evensong, Matins, or a School Eucharist. On Sundays, when there is an Evening service, Catholic pupils may instead attend Mass in the Founder's Chapel. Parents are welcome at Sunday services, but tickets are required for Remembrance Sunday and the Carol Service.\n\nFriday morning chapel is reserved for congregational singing practice. Attendance at all chapel services is compulsory, except where individual exemptions are granted on religious grounds.\n\nChapel provides a variety of worship experience: hymn-singing; Psalm chanting; the choir performs a repertoire of Church Music; Candle-lit Carols; Eucharists in Millennium Chapel; Remembrance Sunday with the sounding of The Last Post and The Silence.\n\nEach year there is a Confirmation Service in late January and pupils from any year group except the Fourths (who hadn't been at the school when it was open to sign up) can be prepared for this.\n\nThe school retains the old chapel used by the school prior to 1927. However, when the school first moved to Godalming even this was not built, and the pupils walked the 2 miles to Shackleford Church. Pupils ever since have benefited, because the time taken for the walk ruled out the continuance of Sunday school, which ran from 10am to 10:30 on Sundays, which has remained a non-teaching day ever since.\n\nThe Lower School consists of the first three years of attendance at Charterhouse, being the Fourth Form, the Removes and the Fifth Form (GCSE year). Pupils in Lower School wear a weekday uniform consisting of a white or blue shirt, house tie, grey trousers, blue jumper, tweed jacket and leather shoes. Sunday dress consists of a dark suit of pinstriped or plain design. A waistcoat is optional. Variations include various society and school honours' ties.\n\nTransition from the Lower School to the Upper School occurs upon successful completion of the GCSE exams.\n\nThe Specialists (Lower and Upper Sixth Forms) constitute the last two years of attendance at Charterhouse, and form the Upper School. Having completed the GCSE exams successfully, 'First & Second Year Specialists' (as they are colloquially referred) spend two years studying for their 'A-Level' examinations, usually in three subjects, although some students will read for four or five.\n\nSpecialists have their own variations on School Dress. Instead of a tweed jacket, Specialists wear a navy blue blazer with gold or blue buttons on the sleeves. Sunday dress remains the same as in the Lowerer School. Historically, those in Gownboys were permitted to wear gowns as a mark of their scholarly status, but this is no longer permitted, as Gownboys is not the only house in which scholars reside. Specialists may also wear pink shirts and silver or nickel cuff-links.\n\nWhether in Lower or Upper School, any pupil who has been awarded his House or School 'Colours' for sport or culture, may wear his 'Colours' tie in place of his house tie. School monitors may also wear their monitor tie instead of a house tie, if they so choose. For further on this, please see below, under \"School Honours\".\n\nDuring Cricket Quarter, the school uniform can vary slightly from that of the two preceding terms. Boys may wear cravats in house colours instead of ties and are permitted to wear straw Boaters similar to the 'Harrow Hat' found at Harrow School, but these are almost never worn by the majority of pupils. Boys in the Under School may also wear navy blazers similar to those worn by the Specialists. As well as these variations, boys may roll up their sleeves in hashes unless asked not to by a beak.\n\nSchool Honours is the Colours system rewarding pupils in various fields with variations on school dress. They are as follows:\n\nHouse colours – House colours are a variation on the house tie. Colours awarded for house sport prowess have thicker stripes in the House colour, whereas those awarded for cultural prowess have thin doubled striped.\n\nSchool colours – School colours are awarded for services to School sport, culture and other areas deemed worthy. They all have a similar design and are covered in Sutton's Crests (The crest of Thomas Sutton). However, they come in varying colours:\n\"The Head of School\" – The Head of School (head boy) is permitted to wear a Pink tie adorned with Sutton Crests, sometimes reversed.\n\"1st XI Major Sports\" – Members of the 1st Team in major school sports (football, hockey and cricket) are permitted to wear maroon ties.\n\"Minor Sports\" – Holders of colours in Minor Sports are permitted to wear a silver tie covered in Sutton Hospital Crests.\n\"Academic/Scholars\" – Holders of Academic or Scholars colours are permitted to wear a Cambridge Blue tie or bow tie with Sutton Crests.\n\"Culture\" – Those deemed worthy enough in cultural fields are permitted to wear a purple tie.\n\"Service\" – Brown ties are awarded for commendable service to the school community. Most frequently they are awarded by the CCF.\n\n1st XI Cricket – Members of the 1st XI Cricket team are permitted to wear pink blazers with Sutton's Crest on the front pocket to Hashes on match days (usually Saturdays).\n\nGreyhounds – Every year a few Carthusians are given Greyhound awards for outstanding service to the school. Those awarded the prize are permitted to wear a navy blue tie with rampant gold greyhounds.\n\nAcademic – Pupils who have gained distinctive academic achievements are awarded the Academic Tie and are referred as Scholars of the school. They are permitted to wear a Cambridge Blue tie with the Sutton Crest.\n\nCulture – Pupils who have contributed to the school distinctively in terms of culture (music, drama etc.) are awarded the Culture Tie, which has a deep purple colour with the Sutton Crest.\n\nCarthusian Day is the main social event of the school calendar. It is held on day preceding the Exeat in CQ and Sunday dress is worn. The day is intended for the parents and families of Carthusians to visit the school. Speeches are made and Sports events played: including the annual Cricket and Golf matches between Carthusians and Old Carthusians. It also gives parents the chance to see their sons' and daughters' work (such as the traditional Archives project done by Fourths on old Carthusians killed in World War I).\n\nFounder's Day is celebrated every year to commemorate the founding of the school and to thank the founder and benefactor Thomas Sutton. It is considered one of the most important days of the year and is held on the last day of OQ. The day consists of 'clearing up' in houses before 'Founders Feast', a large feast for the whole school where Black Tie is worn. The feast is followed by games and activities.\n\nSt. Andrew's Day is celebrated by an annual ball hosted by the historical 'Scottish Dancing society. On St. Andrews Day pupils are permitted to wear traditional Scottish dress including a Kilt, Ghillies and a Sporran.\n\n'The 50 Mile Walk' is an annual event for the 1st Year specialists held at the end of CQ. It consists of walking a stretch from Brighton to the Brooke Hall arch and taking regular Hashes the next day. The March originates from the 1950s when the American Navy SEALs challenged the School, saying that only they could walk and go to work the next day. Those who complete the walk in less than 24 Hours are awarded a special '50' tie, which until 2006 consisted of a navy blue tie with the school crest that has a '50' written below it. The current tie is a thickly striped affair in Pink (for the school), Green (for the countryside) and Blue (for the night)\n\nLeavers' Day is the last day of CQ when the Second Year Specialists come to the end of their school careers. After the Leavers Chapel, the entire school does 2 lap around 'Green' while several men dressed in Scottish traditional Scottish dress play the bagpipes. The leaving Second Year Specialists do an extra lap signifying their loyalty to the school.\n\n'Lack of Talent' is an annual show of Carthusian musical talent and sketches run entirely by pupils and held in the BTT during the start of OQ. It is usually hosted by two second year Specialists and acts are selected by a panel of pupils in the Second Year Specialists. Such acts are predominantly music based, however comedy sketches have become increasingly popular (as they were a large part of the original Lack of Talent in 2000) with many of the staff looking forward to the Brooke Hall parody sketch that has become a regular feature. It is one of the few productions in the school's theatre that students and visitors have to pay a fee to see, originally with the concept this would go to global, less obvious charities and raise peoples awareness of their causes.\n\nMonitors are chosen pupils who are deemed to have the best qualities in leadership and achievement. Each house has at least one monitor, who is appointed Head of House (the most senior pupil in house). On a school-wide level one monitor is appointed the Head of School, and a deputy is appointed to assist. Monitors may wear Navy blue ties and Navy scarves with an embroidered crest. Monitors are also permitted to ride bikes to and from hashes as well as out of Hash time.\n\nThe Headmaster's Essay Society, also known as the 'House Apostles' is a historical society of twelve Carthusians deemed to be the most intellectual in the school. It is the most exclusive club to get into at Charterhouse. The students are invited by the Headmaster to present papers on chosen subjects on Monday evenings and meetings are held in the Headmaster's House. All members are allowed to wear Cambridge Blue Academic ties or scarfs.\n\nToday, pupils take part in a range of sporting activities. The former England batsman and captain Peter May was educated at Charterhouse. Martin Bicknell, the former Surrey and England seam bowler joined the school as head of cricket following his retirement from the sport in 2006.\n\nIn 1999–2000, the Charterhouse first XI reached the final of the ISFA Cup, after winning all their previous rounds away from home, but were narrowly beaten 0–1 in the final at the Leicester City ground by Shrewsbury. The school first XI of the year 2006–7 again reached the ISFA cup final, losing on penalties after a one-all draw with Hampton. One year later, the school first XI again qualified for the ISFA cup final against Millfield. Because of poor weather conditions, it was decided that the match would be played on one of Charterhouse's pitches instead of the usual Walkers Stadium or the replacement at Woking F.C. stadium. The team won this match on penalties. In March 2011, the school reached another ISFA final, a fixture with Eton after knocking out Repton and Millfield in the quarter and semi-final respectively. They ran out comfortable 2–0 winners on the day.\n\nCharterhouse has an historic joint claim to having founded Association Football, which remains the main Winter sport at the school. During the 1840s at both Charterhouse and Westminster School pupils' surroundings meant they were confined to playing their football in the cloisters, making the rough and tumble of the handling game that was developing at other schools such as Rugby impossible, and necessitating a new code of rules. During the formulation of the rules of the Association Football in the 1860s representatives of Charterhouse and Westminster School pushed for a passing game, in particular rules that allowed forward passing (\"passing on\"). Other schools (in particular Eton College, Shrewsbury School and Harrow) favoured a dribbling game with a tight off-side rule. It is claimed that Stoke Ramblers was formed in 1863 when former pupils of Charterhouse School formed a football club while apprentices at the North Staffordshire Railway works in Stoke-on-Trent. By 1867 the Football Association had chosen in favour of the Charterhouse and Westminster game and adopted a \"loose\" off-side rule that permitted forward passing. The modern forward-passing game was a direct consequence of Charterhouse and Westminster football.\n\nIn the early years of the FA Cup, teams formed of ex-pupils from these schools dominated the competition. The Old Carthusians F.C. (the name for the team composed of Charterhouse alumni) won the cup in the 1880–81 season, beating the Old Etonians in the final, and were semi-finalists in the two years that followed. The public school system also provided many of the first England internationals. They included Charles Wreford-Brown, who is often credited for inventing the word \"soccer\". He was a pupil at Charterhouse in the early 1880s, and played football for the Old Carthusians and for the national side in the 1890s, including several appearances as captain.\n\nDuring the past few years, Charterhouse has performed well in the Independent Schools Football Association cup. In 2007, Charterhouse were runners-up but in 2008 they were able to beat Millfield and win the cup. They had another success in 2010 with a 2–0 victory in the final over Eton College.\n\nThe first recorded match on the school cricket ground came in 1859, when the school played Marlborough College. From its inception, the school has used the ground to take on a number of colleges in England. The cricket ground has held a single List-A match, which was played between Surrey and Warwickshire in the 1972 John Player League. Starting in 2006, the ground has held a number of Surrey Second XI fixtures in the Second XI Championship and Second XI Trophy.\n\nThe School's Herbarium carries the Index Herbariorum designation GOD and is maintained as The Charterhouse School Herbarium in the University and Jepson Herbaria, University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe scope of the collections is mainly the British Isles, although some plants are from Europe, South Africa and eastern North America. The principal collectors were James Edward Moxon, Rev. George Brown Moxon, Rev. Tullie Cornthwaite, Rev. Samuel Titmas (first curator of Charterhouse Museum), Frederick Yorke Brocas, Andrew Bloxam, William Gardiner, James Buckman and John Drew Salmon. The collections are currently being digitised and being released by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland, on the herbaria@home website.\n\nIn any given year, there is some contention about which is the most expensive public school in England, depending on whether one compares day fees or boarding fees. In December 2012 Charterhouse was reported to be the fifth most expensive for boarding pupils. Charging up to £11,415 per term in 2014/15, Charterhouse is the 7th most expensive HMC boarding school in the UK. For the 2016/17 academic year, boarding fees are £39,165 and day boarding is £32,364.\n\nIn November 2005, the school was one of fifty of the country's leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by \"The Times\" newspaper, although the schools made clear that they had not realised that the change to the law (which had happened only a few months earlier) about the sharing of information had subsequently made it an offence. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. Mrs Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the director-general of the Office of Fair Trading saying: \"They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.\"\n\nIn August 2010, former English footballer Gary Lineker publicly accused Charterhouse of failing his son, George, in his bid for a place at university. Lineker claimed that the school had used him as a 'guinea pig' by ditching A-Levels for the new Cambridge Pre-U. The school reacted by saying it was proud of its students' results. John Witheridge, then headmaster, defended the choice of the Pre-U as being more academically rigorous and educationally valid than the current A-Level standard in an article in The Spectator in August 2010.\n\nIn September 2015, it was reported that the school had seen a \"revolt\" against Richard Pleming, the headmaster, from pupils and parents who accused him of using \"draconian methods\". In October 2016 it was announced that Pleming would step down from his position as Headmaster in January, after three years. The move attracted particular attention given that the unusual decision was taken for Pleming to step down during Long Quarter, and before the end of his contract. The school's Second Master, Andrew Turner, assumed the position of headmaster until the end of the academic year, with Pleming continuing to work at the school fulfilling his teaching duties until the end of the academic year.\n\nProtests from the local community were triggered by a plan to sell off playing fields in 2018.\n\nIn March 2012, it was reported that a 16-year-old had filmed fellow pupils while they showered, and stored the images on his laptop. The boy was taken into custody by Surrey Police for questioning. A police inquiry was subsequently established.\n\nIn April 2013, a physics teacher, Dr Dean Johnson, resigned after allegations of an 'inappropriate relationship' with a former teenage girl pupil led to a police investigation. A police investigation followed, and resulted in a conviction after trial by a jury for the teacher who was found to be in possession of extreme pornography, which depicted a woman being hanged, in 2015; he was given eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. A professional misconduct panel later found:\n\n\nIn 2018, Cathy Newman, who attended the school on a scholarship said that she was humiliated and sexually harassed while a pupil at the school. Other ex-pupils told \"The Times\" about experiences including a humiliating initiation ceremony at the school and flashing and groping incidents. Rebecca Willis, commenting on similar themes around the time reiterated these themes, but also commented on racialism which resulted on Asian children leaving . The school has subsequently contacted former pupils to ask them to share concerns.\n\nThe school is occasionally used as a film location. It was used to represent the Palace of Westminster in the 2018 BBC drama Bodyguard. It has previously been used in The Boys are Back, Jupiter Ascending, St Trinians 2, The Mystery of Edwin Drood (an adaptation of a Charles Dickens novel), Foyles War, An Ideal Husband, and Vampire Academy.\n\nFormer pupils are referred to as Old Carthusians, and current pupils as Carthusians.\n\n\nThree Old Carthusians have won the Victoria Cross:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57299241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57299241", "title": "GOAT Index", "text": "GOAT Index\n\nThe GOAT Index (\"Greatest of All Time\") is a system used in sports to rank the best performers in any given role. The concept/name was created by author and analyst Ben Hinson and first used in a 2016 study Hinson created to rank the best NBA players from the mid 1970s - early 2000s. In 2017, ESPN published their first GOAT Index, ranking the best quarterbacks in the NFL from 1978 to 2017.\n\nHinson's GOAT Index, first published in December 2016 was designed to rank the best NBA players based on calculated \"GT Scores.\" Hinson's GOAT (GT) Scores account for pacing and rotation minutes as each metric used is assessed on a per 36 minute basis (the only exception being Win Shares, which is assessed on a per 48 minute basis). Unlike Hollinger's Player Efficiency Rating and Game Scores, GT scores apply equal weight to each metric used, the idea being that no basketball performance metric is more important (or less) than others. By evenly applying defensive, offensive and contribution metrics, no particular player profile is favored. Metrics in the GT index are a combination of general stats like PPG and advanced stats like Win Shares and Usage Rates. Also, the GT Index is not based on a league average, but rather indexes the selected players against themselves, creating an \"elite\" and holistic way to evaluate performance. As it adjusts for rotation minutes, the GT Index rewards players who make the best use of their time on the court across all facets of the game. The GT Index also factors in effective shooting rates (eFG%), turnovers and personal fouls as weighted metrics, a key difference from Hollinger's PER and Game Scores. Hinson also maintains that traits like a players heart, ability to motivate teammates and other \"soft/unmeasurable\" traits factor into the Win Share metric.\n\nThe formula for Hinson's basketball GT (GOAT) Scores is as follows:\n\nTotal GTS, which represents the full performance rating for an NBA player. This score combines selected regular season and playoff paced metrics and applies weights to reflect the difference in importance between regular season and playoff games:\n\nPlayoffs GTS, which focuses on the performance rating for an NBA player over the playoffs (can also be applied to regular season):\n\nLegend:\n\n\"Note: For Total GTS, 6.05 equates to 0.06045455 rounded to one decimal place.\"\n\n\"Note: For Total GTS, 3.05 equates to 0.03045455 rounded to one decimal place.\"\n\n\"Note: For Playoffs GTS, 9.1 equates to 9.090909 rounded to one decimal place.\"\n\n\"Note: totals in denominators refer to the selected player pool totals/averages, not league\"\n\nFrom Hinson's 2016 GOAT Index, Hakeem Olajuwon edged out Michael Jordan by a fraction of a point to be the \"GOAT\" from the eras used in the study.\n\nIn July 2017, ESPN published their first GOAT Index aimed at ranking the top NFL quarterbacks in modern history. The ESPN GOAT Index like Hinson's earlier study also considered players from the 1970s, and utilized a voting panel consisting of NFL coaches and executives (all Super Bowl winners), each of whom voted on their top ten quarterbacks. The final quarterback rankings were determined based on how frequently any quarterback outranked his peers across all voting ballots. The ESPN voting panel consisted of Pete Carroll, Tony Dungy, Mike Holmgren, Howard Mudd, Wade Phillips, Mike Reinfeldt, Ray Rhodes, Mike Shanahan, Al Saunders and Norv Turner.\n\nTom Brady emerged as the GOAT from the ESPN survey with 86.7% coverage.\n\n"}

Details of the camp emerged in the South African media, resulting in protest from the upper administrative levels of South African rugby.\n\nSoon after the naming of the Springboks World Cup team in September 2003, Boks coach Rudolf Straeuli arranged for the team to go to a police camp in the South African bush, near the town of Thabazimbi. He delegated the responsibility for running the team camp. Several members of staff proclaimed the intention was to banish a sense of individuality from players.\n\nSoon after the Boks were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Rugby World Cup, a South African newspaper reported that before the RWC, the Boks had been sent to a boot camp where players had allegedly been ordered into a freezing lake naked to pump up rugby balls underwater. The story also alleged that players who tried to get out of the lake, including Boks captain Corné Krige, were forced back in at gunpoint. Within days, several South African newspapers ran pictures leaked from the camp, showing players standing naked in the lake and holding rugby balls in front of their private parts, and shivering Boks players huddled naked in a pit. The whistleblower emerged as Boks video analyst Dale McDermott.\n\nIn the days that followed, the media reported other details from the camp:\n\nMost South Africans condemned Kamp Staaldraad, including the South African military forces; a spokesman for the South African National Defence Force pointedly told the \"Cape Times\" newspaper that the force never trained its recruits naked, and he knew of no military organization in the world that did so. Many rugby observers also pointed out that trying to eliminate all individuality from a team could be counterproductive, as there are many times during a rugby match when individual initiative can make the difference between victory and defeat.\n\nStraeuli defended the camp as more details became public, but eventually resigned. Higher-ups in the country's rugby establishment initially refused to distance themselves from Kamp Staaldraad; many of them were purged at the same time as Straeuli. The Boks' disappointing results in 2003 (early exit from the RWC; record losses to France, England, Scotland, and New Zealand; a last-minute win over Argentina) were enough by themselves to threaten the jobs of Straeuli and many rugby executives. However, their attempts to defend Kamp Staaldraad apparently were the last straw for many South African rugby supporters, and for many within the rugby establishment who saw the need for dramatic change.\n\nIn a tragic postscript to the story, McDermott was found dead from a bullet wound to the head at his home in Durban on 9 January 2005. His death was eventually determined to be a suicide; no foul play had been suspected. McDermott's mother reported that he had suffered extreme clinical depression in the months leading to his death. After supplying the images that led to the controversy, he was forced to leave his job at the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (from which he had been contracted out to the Boks) and returned to teaching at Durban High School. Jake White, who took over as Boks coach after the forced resignation of Straeuli, tried to bring McDermott back into the Boks staff, but SA Rugby vetoed the re-appointment.\n"}

It is located off Kentucky State Highway 1973 (Iron Works Pike) and Interstate 75, at Exit 120, in northern Fayette County in the United States. The equestrian facility is a park dedicated to \"man's relationship with the horse.\" Open to the public, the park has a twice daily Horses of the World Show, showcasing both common and rare horses from around the globe. The horses are ridden in authentic costume. Each year the park is host to a number of special events and horse shows.\n\nAdditionally, the park contains the International Museum of the Horse, a Smithsonian Affiliate, which has a permanent collection of horse history and memorabilia, along with a rotating historical collection focused on a particular theme. Past themes include A Gift from the Desert (Arabia), Imperial China, and All the Queen's Horses (Britain).\n\nBeginning with the 1979 arrival of Forego, one of the leading handicap horses of the 1970s, the Kentucky Horse Park has been home to some of the world's greatest competition horses, including John Henry, Horse of the Decade for the 1980s and the top money-winning Thoroughbred gelding in racing history. With the exception of a few months in 1986, John Henry lived at the park from 1985 until his death in 2007, alongside other racing greats such as Forego and his fellow 1970s champion Bold Forbes, and more recent residents Cigar, voted Horse of the Decade for the 1990s, and Da Hoss, the first horse to win Breeders' Cup races in non-consecutive years. In late 2008, the champions Alysheba and Funny Cide became residents, but Alysheba died at the park in March 2009. 1994 Kentucky Derby winner, Go For Gin, became a resident of the barn in 2011, while Cigar died at the park in 2014.\n\nBesides Thoroughbred horses, Standardbred pacing greats such as Staying Together and Western Dreamer, Cam Fella (deceased) and Rambling Willie (deceased), and Standardbred trotting champion Mr. Muscleman have made the Kentucky Horse Park their home, as well as 5-gaited American Saddlebred geldings CH Gypsy Supreme, CH Imperator and CH Sky Watch (all deceased).\n\nA number of horse sculptures stand in the Kentucky Horse Park, including a Man o' War statue on a pedestal near the entrance, over the horse's grave, which was moved here from Faraway Farm during the establishment of the park in the 1970s. There is also a life-size statue of the 1973 U.S. Triple Crown winner Secretariat with jockey Ron Turcotte aboard being led by groom Eddie Sweat, sculpted by Jim Reno. From harness racing, there is a statue of Bret Hanover.\n\nThe Kentucky Horse Park also contains the National Horse Center, headquarters for more than 30 national, regional and state equine organizations and associations including: \n\nFor a list of all 30+ organizations in one place, with contacts, see the Kentucky Horse Park website.\n\nRolex Stadium is the primary outdoor event venue in the complex. The stadium seats in its main grandstand but can accommodate up to total capacity when bleachers seating up to are used, primarily for larger outdoor horse shows, concerts, and other sporting events. Its show ring measures 306 feet by 406 feet, with the flooring made of sand and fiber; however, artificial turf has been brought into the stadium for soccer and football games on occasion, among other events. It is the largest outdoor concert venue in Central Kentucky with a capacity of up to nearly . There are six concession stands at the stadium and six restrooms, meaning that concession and restroom facilities may be limited for events that require larger capacity; however Rolex Stadium features an 18-by-33-foot Daktronics ProStar LED videoscreen.\n\nAlltech Arena is Kentucky Horse Park's -seat indoor arena, expandable to for concerts. The arena floor and championship ring measures 135 feet by 300 feet; in addition in indoor horse shows, Alltech Arena can also be used for indoor football, ice hockey, basketball, circuses, boxing, wrestling, concerts, and other special events. The arena contains nine luxury suites, 222 VIP box seats and a -square-foot club lounge seating up to 80 patrons. The arena floor is below street level; the arena concourse, with square feet of space, overlooks the arena floor and contains six concession stands. There are also two box offices at the arena.\n\nThe Kentucky Horse Park hosts diverse educational events and competitions. Past examples include:\n\nAlso, in 2015 the park became the new home of the Ichthus Music Festival, a major Christian music festival originally held in nearby Wilmore until its temporary demise following its 2012 edition.\n\nFor a constantly up-to-date list of all park events, see the Kentucky Horse Park website.\n\nOn December 6, 2005, it was announced that Lexington and the Kentucky Horse Park would host the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games in September and October. The 2010 games marked the first time the games were held outside of Europe; additionally, the eight Olympic-level world championships had never been held together in a single location within Europe.\n\nAs part of the games, several improvements to the park were slated:\n\nOn February 1, 2007, Governor Ernie Fletcher announced that he would seek an additional $38.3 million in improvements to the park in preparation for the games and other major horse events. In his address to the 2007 General Assembly the governor suggested:\n\nThe new indoor stadium and additional exhibition space, costing $28 million, would be financed with 20-year bonds. The roadway improvements, at $10.3 million within the park would come from the state highway fund. The resort hotel would be constructed and financed without state funds.\n\nAlthough the park is owned by the state government, it is administered separately from the state park system.\n\nKentucky Horse Park Arboretum\n\n"}

The Vikings trailed 23–9 in the fourth quarter, but won after Vikings quarterback Tommy Kramer passed for two touchdowns to wide receiver Ahmad Rashad in the last two minutes, including a 46-yard Hail Mary pass caught with one hand on the last play of the game. The final play is also known as the \"Miracle Catch.\" The Vikings won, 28–23.\n\nThe Vikings came into the game with an 8–6 record. The Browns, nicknamed the Kardiac Kids for their many close games, were 10–4. A win for the Browns would clinch them a playoff berth, while a win for the Vikings would clinch them the NFC Central and a playoff appearance. The Browns were favored by 3 points.\n\nThe Browns opened up the scoring in the first quarter when their quarterback, eventual league MVP Brian Sipe, threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Hill, giving Cleveland a 7–0 lead. In the second quarter, the Browns added to their lead when Sipe ran for a two-yard touchdown, but kicker Don Cockroft failed to convert the extra point, so the score was 13–0 going into halftime.\n\nIn the second half, the Vikings offense came alive, led by Tommy Kramer. Kramer threw a 31-yard touchdown to Joe Senser at the beginning of the quarter. Vikings kicker Rick Danmeier then missed an extra point of his own, making the score 13–6 in favor of the Browns. Cockroft and Danmeier both made short field goals for their teams later in the third quarter, and the score grew to 16–9. Early in the fourth quarter, Cleo Miller ran for a two-yard Browns touchdown, making the score 23–9 with the extra point and seemingly putting the game away.\n\nKramer led a drive for the Vikings in response that resulted in a second touchdown pass, this time to running back Ted Brown, with 5:01 remaining in the game. Danmeier then missed another extra point, meaning the Vikings still trailed by two scores, 23–15. The Browns received the ensuing kickoff and began trying to run out the clock with repeated handoffs to running back Mike Pruitt. Then, on second and 8 with 2:18 left, Browns coach Sam Rutigliano called a surprise pass play, but Sipe's throw was intercepted by Bobby Bryant, giving the Vikings a chance to come back.\n\nAfter the interception, Kramer led the Vikings down the field, completing 4 of 5 passes for 47 yards and a touchdown to Ahmad Rashād. The drive took only 37 seconds. The Vikings still trailed by 1 point after Danmeier kicked the extra point, and had to kick off with 1:35 left.\n\nAfter the Vikings failed to recover an onside kick, the Browns regained the ball at the Minnesota 44-yard line. They again tried to run out the clock, but on second down, Browns tackle Cody Risien was called for illegal motion, negating a five-yard run by Mike Pruitt and backing the Browns up five yards. This would be the difference in the success of the drive, as Pruitt was tackled by Scott Studwell a yard short of the line to gain on third down. The Browns punted with 23 seconds left, giving the Vikings one last chance.\n\nAfter a touchback on the punt, the Vikings got the ball with 14 seconds left and no timeouts on their own 20-yard line. Vikings coach Bud Grant called a hook and lateral on the drive's first play. Kramer passed to Senser, who immediately lateraled to Ted Brown. Brown ran out of bounds after a 39-yard gain with only five seconds remaining in the game. TheVikingAge called this play the \"greatest trick play in Vikings history.\" Things still looked bleak for the Vikings; NBC broadcaster Len Dawson predicted, \"they're gonna throw that ball up in the air and hope for a miracle.\"\n\nOn the game's final snap, Bud Grant called the play \"Squadron Right\", in which three wide receivers line up on the right side of the Vikings formation and all run go routes to the end zone. Kramer dropped back and threw a Hail Mary pass to the right side into a crowd of players. The pass was tipped by Browns defensive back Thom Darden at the 5-yard line and then caught one-handed by Rashad at the 1-yard line. Rashad went into the end zone for a game-winning touchdown with no time left. Danmeier's extra point was blocked, so the final score was 28–23.\n\nKramer finished with one of the best games of his career, compiling 456 passing yards, 4 touchdowns, and no interceptions. To date, he is the only Vikings quarterback to pass for over 450 yards in a single game. (He topped this total in 1986, passing for 490 yards against the Washington Redskins.)\n\nBy winning this game, the Vikings clinched the NFC Central division title and a spot in the playoffs. As the #3 seed, they traveled to Philadelphia to face the Eagles. Despite holding a 14–7 lead at halftime, the Vikings lost 31–16, and the Eagles went on to win the NFC Championship and appear in Super Bowl XV.\n\nThe Browns overcame their loss and defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the season's final game to win the AFC Central division, but then lost in devastating fashion to the eventual Super Bowl champion Oakland Raiders in the \"Red Right 88\" game.\n\n"}

There are two main types of pistols: pump and semi-automatic.\n\nPaintball pistols are not used in tournament level speedball games. Due to one marker per person rules, a player may not carry two markers onto the field. A pistol has a lower shot capacity, leaving the player at a severe disadvantage against an opponent. Sometimes in recreational settings a player will agree to play with a pistol to put themselves at a severe disadvantage to attempt to prove superior skill over an opponent. Playing in such a situation has many similarities to stock paintball.\nDespite these apparent disadvantages there are a growing number of players who choose to play with a pistol as their primary marker.\n\nPaintball pistols are primarily used as a sidearm. The use of a paintball pistol is often as a last resort situation. In scenario games often drivers of paintball tanks will utilize a paintball pistol as a backup marker.\n\nSome players use them as their primary weapons, such as this player from the paintball team Reaper's Black Hearts from the Woodsball Tournament League.\n\nPaintball pistols are often used as sidearms. Some players have learned diversionary tactics with pistols, pretending to fumble or reload the main marker, only to pull up a close range shot with a pistol. Many players find this kind of action unsportsmanlike, and some fields ban the use of sidearms.\n\nPaintball pistols are manufactured by a number of companies in a few main calibers. The three main ones are 11 mm, 43 mm, .68 cal . The main manufacturers of paintball pistols are Tippmann, Tiberius Arms, and Kingman. The price points on the pistols range from approximately $100–$400.\n\nMany accessories are available for paintball pistols including holsters, mock silencers, scopes, flashlights, laser lights, and high performance part kits.\n\nAnother new development from paintball manufacturers is First Strike Rounds. First strike rounds are designed to replace the .68 caliber paintball and are being introduced into the market. They can be very useful in paintball pistols where accuracy can be an issue. The advantage to using first strike rounds is their uniform shape. Most regular paint balls can easily become malformed causing the paintball to veer off course and resulting in numerous misses. When you only have a few rounds as is the case with paintball pistols this can end up in your elimination from the game. First Strike Rounds allow consistency and accuracy even in pistols.\n\nAs compared to a standard paintball marker:\n\n\n\nList of Paintball Pistols.\n"}

It was not until many years later when the game began to spread internationally that an official was included.\n\nBefore the creation of rugby referees, the captains from both teams would set the rules down before the game began. The two captains would arbitrate the game together as it went on. This is where the ‘advantage’ law comes from in rugby union. This was because a team’s captain was not likely to complain or stop play if his side benefited from the other team’s infringement.\n\nIn 1892, the International Rugby Board was created as a result of a disputed try that the captains could not agree on whether it had been scored. The rugby laws were changed to require one referee and two touch judges at each game to make the arbitration easier and more consistent.\n\nSince then the match official’s job has remained constant. The main change has been in the uniform and since 2000 the use of communication equipment and the television match official has greatly increased.\n\nRugby union match officials must use the following equipment:\n\nRugby union match officials may use the following equipment:\n\nBefore the game, a referee must:\n\nThe duties of the referee during the game are:\n\nAfter the game a referee is required to:\n\nThe referee having made a decision is required to indicate the decision by blowing the whistle and signalling. \nPrimary signals relate to what decision is being awarded. For example, whether a scrum or penalty is awarded. \nSecondary signals relate to why the decision is being awarded. For example, a knock-on (scrum) or a high tackle (penalty).\nThere are also signals for stoppages in time, replacement and scoring to ensure everyone knows what is happening.\n\nAssistant referees are appointed by the union in charge of the fixture. They are either themselves qualified referees or qualified assistant referees. Assistant referees may be asked to help with duties that touch judges cannot. Touch judges are normally supplied by the teams playing, one from each team.\n\n\nDuring the game touch judges and assistant referees must:\n\nAdditional responsibilities of assistant referees:\n\nA touch judge has no responsibilities after a match. The only responsibility an assistant referee has is to complete a written report to send to the referee that is then sent to the union in charge of the game. The report is only required if a player has been sent off or temporarily suspended because of their report on foul play.\n\nThe touch judges and assistant referees cannot stop play, but can signal the referee to enable them to assist him.\n\nOften referred to as \"TMO\" or \"video referee\", a television match official may be appointed to assist the referee in determining whether points have been scored. A television match official can only rule on exactly what the referee asks them (and in most unions they can only be asked about events in-goal or immediately before entering in-goal). Television match officials are commonly used in first class and international televised games.\n\nIn lower level games, where no TMO has been appointed, the referee cannot use video equipment in supporting any decision. (Local or junior matches are often recorded by coaches or parents, these videos cannot be used by the referee in supporting a decision due to the possibility of bias. Such videos may though be acceptable as evidence in any post-match discipline hearing.)\n\nAt higher levels of rugby, some games have appointed substitution controllers (sometimes called the \"fourth official\"). These officials liaise with the teams and ensure they only use their permitted number of substitutions. They also indicate to the referee when a substitute is ready to come on. They often use signs with the number of the player coming off and the player going on the field. This means it is one less thing for the referee to worry about. The substitution controller is also usually the reserve assistant referee. This means that if a referee is injured, one of the assistant referees will take over and the substitution controller will become an assistant referee. If an assistant referee is injured the substitution controller will take the place of the assistant referee.\n\nA timekeeper may also be appointed to indicate to the referee when they believe a half should end. Ultimately, it is up to the referee to decide.\n\nIn-goal judges are used in the seven-a-side variation of rugby union to assist the referee in awarding a try and signalling kicks at goal instead of the assistant referees.\n\nAssaults on rugby referees are being reported more and more in the media. One study found that around six percent of United Kingdom referees surveyed had been physically assaulted. A further examination of the study found that rugby union referees' fear of being assaulted was a significant factor for increased stress. The same study found that rugby referees were most concerned about being assaulted by a spectator or coach. A study by Rainey and Hardy found that it was in fact players who committed assaults on referees the most, contributing to seventy-nine percent of all assaults on referees.\n\nAs a reaction to this rugby unions have begun handing out long bans and large fines to individuals who physically assault a referee and more recently verbal assault of referees has also received severe punishments. Now the common punishment for a player punching a referee or anything similar is a lifetime ban. The laws of the game have also been changed to help this by making it compulsory for any official to report any abuse on them or another official to the union in charge of the fixture.\n\nAppointments of officials to games are usually done by the Union in charge of the fixture. The appointment of referees to international games comes from the IRB International Referees Panel. This ensures that the best officials are adjudicating international matches. Other major competitions such as Super Rugby, Heineken Cup and age group world cups use a similar system.\n\n\nReferences to the \"Laws\" or a \"Law\" are to the \"Laws of the game: Rugby Union 2010\", published by the International Rugby Board, Dublin, Ireland.\n\n"}

It also chooses coaches for the national team (presently Cyrus Poncha and Major S. Maniam). The rise of squash worldwide with many players in the top 100 worldwide and India's higher rankings worldwide are a testament to the hard work put in by the administrators and players over the last decade.\n\nAmong the major facilities created by the SRFI is the ICL-TNSRA squash academy, which hosted the World Team Championship in 2007.\n\nConflict between the SRFI and squash athletes came to a fore in 2005, when the government was conferring the Dronacharya award on SRFI affiliated squash coach Cyrus Poncha. India's number one squash player Joshna Chinappa wrote a letter to the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs that she never trained under Poncha, and that he had misused her name to get the Dronacharya award. \nThe SRFI chairman Ramachandran then produced testimonials from Joshna where she acknowledges the support of SRFI and Poncha.\n\nIn 2008, the SRFI chose a woman's squad for the Asian championships without Dipika Pallikal, who was then training in Egypt, after having recently won the under-17 British Open.

It derives from (Ancient Greek meaning \"the art of playing ball\"), the term originally given to lawn tennis by Walter Clopton Wingfield.\n\nStické is played with standard lawn tennis racquets and low pressure balls in an enclosed court. The court is somewhat similar to a real tennis court in shape, but is smaller (about 78 feet by 27 feet) and different in construction. Play takes place using all the basics of lawn tennis and the same scoring system, with the addition of side and back walls. Players face each other over the net in pairs. \n\nAs in real tennis, there is a \"penthouse,\" used throughout the game as a playing surface and on which the service has to land to start each point. Some courts have a penthouse only down the side, while others have a penthouse at both ends as well. \n\nThere were over 50 courts built throughout the British Empire since 1875. The dimensions of the Taplow Court built by Lord Desborough in 1892 became the standard. In the early 20th century, stické was a popular recreation at many country houses.

The only escape that Jim has from the reality of the streets is heroin, for which he steals, robs, and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie (Ernie Hudson), an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim \"picked up a game\" now and then, he is able to begin the long journey back to sanity. Ultimately, Jim's mother has him arrested when he shows up at her home high and demands money. The journey ends with Jim's incarceration in Riker's Island for four crimes: assault, robbery, resistance of arrest, and possession of narcotics. After Jim spends months in prison and ceases his drug use, he gets released, changes his life, and performs poetry drawn from his diaries.\n\nThe film currently holds a 46% \"Rotten\" rating at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave two stars out of four, concluding, \"At the end, Jim is seen going in through a \"stage door,\" and then we hear him telling the story of his descent and recovery. We can't tell if this is supposed to be genuine testimony or a performance. That's the problem with the whole movie.\"\n\nAfter the 1997 Heath High School shooting, activist Jack Thompson brought this film into a $33 million lawsuit in 1999 claiming that the film's plot (along with two internet pornography sites, several computer game companies, and makers and distributors of the 1994 film \"Natural Born Killers\") caused 14-year-old Michael Carneal to shoot members of a prayer group. The case was dismissed in 2001.\n\nThe film became controversial in the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre and the Heath High School shooting, when critics noted similarities between these shooting attacks and a dream sequence in the film in which the protagonist wears a black trenchcoat and shoots six classmates in his school classroom. The film has been specifically named in lawsuits brought by the relatives of murder victims.\n\n\"The Basketball Diaries\" soundtrack was released in 1995 by PolyGram to accompany the film, featuring songs from Pearl Jam and PJ Harvey. \"AllMusic\" rated it three stars out of five.\n\n"}

A comedy about Little League baseball, it stars Tom Ewell.\n\nIn a small New York town called Willow Falls, a new manager is needed for the Panthers, a local Little League baseball team. Bruce Hallerton, a lawyer by trade, volunteers for the job, deciding it would be a way to spend more time with his son, Dennis.\n\nWhen it turns out Dennis is instead assigned to play for another team, the Tigers, wife Betty assumes that Bruce will quit the coaching job, but he feels a commitment has been made and needs to be kept. Bruce sets about advising his Panther players that trying is more important than winning, but many parents disagree, and Tigers coach Ed Ryder in particular will do anything necessary to win a game.\n\nOne parent, widow Doris Patterson, appears to flirt with Bruce in coaxing him to let her son Herbie be his team's pitcher. Another, the wealthy banker George Carruthers, invites the Hallertons over for dinner, only to pitch his own son Foster to the coach.\n\nParticularly inept at first, the Panthers are mocked by everyone, even Bruce's own son. Betty, too, criticizes her husband's inability to make the team improve on the field. She also becomes so jealous at Doris's perceived romantic interest in Bruce that she studies baseball from a manual so she can become the team's official scorekeeper and keep an eye on him at the same time.\n\nBruce tells the widow he is happily married and discourages her personal interest in him, offending Doris, who had no such interest at all. After a brawl breaks out between the Panthers and Tigers and continued criticism of his methods, Bruce goes to a bar with a buddy, O'Keefe, and gets tipsy. He comes home to find the door bolted by his wife. At the next game, Bruce decides to use O'Keefe's surprisingly fast son, nicknamed \"Man Mountain\", and he becomes a hero in a Panther victory.\n\nNo one congratulates Bruce, so he goes home vowing never to volunteer again, but when all the parents and kids show up later to thank him, Bruce volunteers to become a scoutmaster for the boys.\n\n\nAccording to MGM records the movie earned $390,000 in the US and Canada and $130,000 elsewhere, making a loss to the studio of $332,000.\n\n\n"}

The turf field is no longer suitable for soccer and lacrosse due to alterations to the track facilities. \n\nThe stadium was finished in 1979, as a complete rebuild of a previous facility. It is owned by Kanawha County Schools. In 2003, because the school board lacked funds to maintain the stadium, it entered into a joint venture with the private University of Charleston. UC invested over $1.5 million to replace the turf, add locker rooms and a skybox, and make other improvements in exchange for access and naming rights. Originally the home field of Capital High School football after the consolidation Stonewall High School and Charleston High School. Multiple middle school and community teams also play at the location. It hosts the state high school track and field championships. The field has also played host to multiple high school playoff games as well as being host to the State Championships before their move to Wheeling in the 90's. It also hosts the Gazette-Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival at the end of September of each year. \n\nRecord attendance for this stadium was set at a local high school contest, Charleston High School vs. Stonewall Jackson High School in the latter part of the 1980s, later to be locally called \"The Game\" of the century.

{"id": "21828997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21828997", "title": "Win probability", "text": "Win probability\n\nWin probability is a statistical tool which suggests a sports team's chances of winning at any given point in a game, based on the performance of historical teams in the same situation. The art of estimating win probability involves choosing which pieces of context matter. Baseball win probability estimates often include whether a team is home or away, inning, number of outs, which bases are occupied, and the score difference. Because baseball proceeds batter by batter, each new batter introduces a discrete state. There are a limited number of possible states, and so baseball win probability tools usually have enough data to make an informed estimate.\n\nAmerican football win probability estimates often include whether a team is home or away, the down and distance, score difference, time remaining, and field position. American football has many more possible states than baseball with far fewer games, so football estimates have a greater margin of error. The first win probability analysis was done in 1971 by Robert E. Machol and former NFL quarterback Virgil Carter.\n\nAs a brief example, guessing that each team playing at home will win is based on home advantage. This guess uses a single contextual factor and involves a very large number of games. But with only one factor, the accuracy of this guess is limited to home advantage itself (about 55–70% across sports) and does not change within the game based on in-game factors.\n\nWin probability added is the change in win probability, often how a play or team member affected the probable outcome of the game.\n\nCurrent research work involves measuring the accuracy of win probability estimates, as well as quantifying the uncertainty in individual estimates. That is, if a tool estimates a 24% win probability because 24% of previous teams in that situation won their games, do future teams win at the same 24% rate? Estimating from hidden data uses testing tools like cross-validation.\n\nWhile many models involve frequency analysis of past events, other models use Bayesian processes.\n\nSome models include a measure of teams' strength coming into the game, while others assume every team is average. Including strength estimates increases the number of possible states, and therefore decreases an estimate's power while possibly increasing its accuracy.\n\n"}
