It led to the footballers and hurlers refusing to play for the Cork County Board. The cause of the strike was the issue of deciding who should pick the senior teams' selectors. The players believed the manager should pick the selectors. However, the county board picked the selectors. With the appointment of Teddy Holland as manager, the players also refused to play under his tutorship since he accepted the job during their time of strike.\n\nThe strike drew comment from the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and was the first time in the history of the Gaelic Athletic Association that a strike caused inter county fixtures not to be played.\n\nThe strike was the second strike by Cork players in five years. It began on 10 December 2007 and ended on 18 February 2008 – 97 days after the first threat of strike action – and was declared over on 15 February 2008. However Holland was not fired until 18 February. Kieran Mulvey, chairman of the Labour Relations Commission, acted as arbitrator between the players and county board.\n\n\nOn 10 December, the players officially went on strike. The county board and the players held the first of a series of meetings to try resolve the strike ten days later. On 9 January, the hurlers confirmed they would not play in the Waterford Crystal Cup and the county was forced to give a walkover to Limerick IT.\n\nLater in the month (23 January), Teddy Holland issued a press statement announcing he would not resign. More than 100 club delegates voted unanimously in support of Holland at a county board meeting held on 30 January. Three days earlier (27 January), in a bid to resolve their issues, the players and the county board had held 18 hours of talks, chaired by Kieran Mulvey, which ended in stalemate. Mulvey had been asked to chair the talks by Nickey Brennan, the President of the Gaelic Athletic Association.\n\nIn the week leading up to the National Football League game against Meath, the Cork county board were unable to guarantee a team would be available to play the game. Consequently, on 30 January the game was postponed. The Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, called on both sides to resolve the dispute on 5 February and further talks between Kieran Mulvey and Paraic Duffy, the Director General of the GAA, were held.\n\nOn 7 February the players refused a solution offered by the county board and it looked likely that Cork would be removed from both the National Hurling League and National Football League and be relegated for the following season. It was claimed that under GAA rules that if a team was unable to take part in two league games that they should be disqualified from the league. A second football match was to be played on 16 February while the second hurling game was due on 17 February.\n\nOn 8 February, the Cork players reacted negatively to what they thought was an attempt by the county board to split the footballers and hurlers when a press release claimed the players would accept Holland as manager. The following day Roy Keane compared the 2002 strike to the Saipan incident and warned about players becoming too powerful. A poll showed that 56 percent of fans supported the strike and 70 percent believed the actions of the board damaged Cork's chance of winning All-Ireland championships that year.\n\nThe Cork county board, on 12 February, voted 96–13 in favour of entering binding arbitration with the players in a bid to save the teams being disqualified from the leagues and Nickey Brennan called for the dispute to end, \"however it is achieved.\" On 14 February, the players met with Mulvey and agreed to accept the arbitration in an attempt to end the strike, then in its 95th day.\n\nThe outcome of arbitration on 15 February was as follows:\n\n\nMany newspapers declared the strike over on 15 February after the players accepted the outcome of the arbitration and also declared that Teddy Holland had resigned. However, the GAA confirmed that the Cork-versus-Dublin football and Cork-versus-Waterford hurling games that were due to take place were to be called off.\n\nThe county board called an emergency meeting to discuss the recommendations of the arbitration and especially the recommendation from Mulvey that Holland should resign. By 16 February, uncertainty had emerged over the status of the strike. While the county board and Holland met to discuss the issues, an expected vote by the county board to remove Holland was never called. Holland meanwhile issued a statement that didn't indicate if he had stepped down and stated that he was neutral saying: \"I am my own man and I am proud to be a Cork football man.\" Holland said the claim that six people had refused the job before him was false and there was no threat of strike when he took the job. However, a statement in support of the strike had been issued by the Gaelic Players Association on 13 November 2007, a week before Holland took the job.\n\nOn 17 February it was clear Holland had not resigned or been fired by the county board and that the strike continued. The county board issued a statement saying that they would meet on Monday 18 February to end the strike. The strike officially ended on 18 February – 97 days after the first threat of strike – when, as expected, the county board voted 89–19 to fire Teddy Holland and his selectors, who refused to step down.\n\nThe seven-man panel appointed to help find the next manager began its search as soon as Holland had been removed, and included players Nicholas Murphy and Derek Kavanagh. Conor Counihan was appointed Cork's new football manager with the right to name his own selectors. On 20 February, Seán Óg Ó hAilpín said that, had the strike carried on beyond 18 February, he and others would have resigned from inter-county hurling and football. Cork Under 21 footballer, Sean Cahalane, claimed that the Under 21 panel would not have played in place of the seniors if they had been asked by the county board.\n\nOn 19 February, the Central Competitions Control Committee (CCCC) decided not to remove Cork from the football and hurling leagues, but instead awarded the points from the missed games to their opponents and fined the county board €400 for each game missed. Kilkenny county board offered to play their hurling match with Cork and the Cork county board requested CCCC approve the game. However the CCCC had already awarded Kilkenny the point and would not allow the game to take place. It emerged that Cork couldn't have been removed from the leagues as there was no such rule.\n\nCork went on to win their first football and hurling matches after the strike, beating Dublin's hurlers 2–16 to 3–18 and Roscommon's footballers 0–15 to 1–14 However, the decision to award the teams that Cork did not play victory points had a knock-on effect for other teams in both leagues. Roscommon and Wexford both lodged unsuccessful appeals against the decision. Wexford's case was taken to the Disputes Resolution Authority but was rejected.\n\nWhen the National Hurling League 2008 ended, the Cork and Waterford hurling teams both finished on level points. The CCCC ruled that the teams had to play each other in a play-off and that scoring difference could not be used to separate the teams. (The play-off was to determine which team entered the semi-final and which entered the quarter final.)\n\nHowever, both Dublin and Wexford also finished on level points and, having both played Cork, the CCCC ruled the team's standings at the end of the league could be used and thus scoring difference would apply, thus relegating Wexford. This lead Wexford's chairman to accuse the GAA and the CCCC of \"making the rules up as they go along\".\n"}

{"id": "4496929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4496929", "title": "Abdominal exercise", "text": "Abdominal exercise\n\nAbdominal exercises are those that affect the abdominal muscles (colloquially known as the stomach muscles or \"abs\").\n\nAbdominal exercises are useful for building the abdominal muscles. This is useful for improving performance with certain sports, back pain, and for withstanding abdominal impacts (e.g., taking punches). According to a 2011 study, abdominal muscle exercises are known to increase the strength and endurance of the abdominal muscles.\n\nIt has been highly disputed whether or not abdominal exercises have any reducing effect on abdominal fat. The aforementioned 2011 study found that abdominal exercise does not reduce abdominal fat; to achieve that, a deficit in energy expenditure and caloric intake must be created—abdominal exercises alone are not enough to reduce abdominal fat and the girth of the abdomen. Early results from a 2006 study found that walking exercise (not abdominal exercise specifically) reduced the size of subcutaneous abdominal fat cells; cell size predicts type 2 diabetes according to a lead author. Moderate exercise reduced cell size by about 18% in 45 obese women over a 20-week period; diet alone did not appear to affect cell size.\n\nAbdominal muscles have many important functions, including in breathing, coughing, and sneezing, and maintaining posture and speech in a number of species. The anterior abdominal wall is made up of four muscles—the rectus abdominis muscle, the internal and external obliques, and the transversus abdominis.\"The two internal muscles, the internal oblique and the transverse abdominis, respond more to increases in chemical or volume-related drive than the two external muscles, the rectus abdominis and external oblique; the basis for this differential sensitivity is unknown\".\n\nNot only can a one-sided preference for abdominal muscles (lack of exercise focused on other core muscles) result in creating muscle imbalances, but the effectiveness of exercise is also far from what could be achieved with a balanced workout planning. Core training frequently utilizes balance exercises. These are characterized by an unstable position that requires the use of a wide range of muscles which help balance oscillation of the center of gravity. We can balance both in static positions and while performing dynamic movements.\n\nThe goal of core training is definitely not to develop muscle hypertrophy but to improve functional predispositions of physical activity. This particularly involves improving intra- and intermuscular coordination or synchronization of participating muscles.\n\nInvolvement of the core means more than just compressing abdominal muscles when in crouching or seated position. The role of the core muscles is to stabilize the spine. Resisting expansion or rotation is as important as the ability to execute movement.\n\nThe abdominal muscles can be worked out by practicing disciplines of general body strength such as Pilates, yoga, T'ai chi, and jogging among others. There are also specific routines to target each of these muscles.\n\nOne way to estimate the effectiveness of any abdominal exercise is in measuring the momentaneous activity by electromyography (EMG), with the activity generally being compared to that of the traditional crunch. However, an exercise of lower activity performed during a longer time can give at least as much exercise as a high-activity exercise, with the main difference being that a prolonged duration results more in aerobic exercise than strength training.\n\nThe following tables rank abdominal exercises from highest to lowest in terms of activity as determined by the EMG measures:\nCompared to traditional crunch (100%)\n\nThe bicycle targets the rectus abdominals and the obliques. Also, the rectus abdominals can be worked out with the basic crunch, the vertical crunch, the reverse crunch, and the full vertical crunch, and when at a low enough body fat percentage (10-12% for males, 15-18% for females) the individual parts of the muscle become visible; many refer to this visible separation as a six pack. By exercising the internal and external obliques the stomach can be flattened while the waist line can be reduced. The long arm crunch, in which arms are straightened behind you, adds a longer lever to the move and emphasizes the upper part of the abs. The plank exercise not only strengthens the abs but also the back and stabilizes the muscles.\n\nAbdominal exercises can also be performed with the help of some machines and the captain's chair is one of the most popular machines used in gyms and health clubs. Other machines are the Ab Roller, the Ab Rocket Twister, the Chin-up bar in conjunction with Ab Straps and the Torso Track. The exercise ball is also a tool that helps strengthen the abs. It may be more effective than the crunches on the floor because the abs do more work as the legs are not involved in the exercise. With respect to the Ab-Slide, the study performed by Bird et al. showed greater muscle activation in the upper rectus abdominis, lower rectus abdominis, and external oblique when compared to the standard abdominal crunch. The Ab-Slide has proven to be an effective tool in strengthening the abdominal muscles from a concentric muscle action perspective. However, this research does not support replacing the traditional crunch exercise with the Ab-Slide gadget due to the lack of proven effectiveness in the eccentric loading of the abdominal muscles and the greater postural control. Potentially the most effective equipment for abdominal strengthening are those that offer the least stability. Examples include the CoreFitnessRoller, bodyweight suspension training such as TRX and stability balls with or without the Halo.\n\nAbdominal exercises also put some degree of compressive force on the lumbar spine, putting unwanted stress on the lower back. In addition, exaggerated abdominal exercise can cause respiratory problems. A study of twelve exercises concluded that no single exercise covered all abdominal muscles with high intensity and low compression.\n\nThe benefit of focused training on the \"deep core\" muscles such as the transversus abdominis has been disputed, with some experts advocating a more comprehensive training regimen.\n\n"}

The art originated in the 7th century AD during the reign of Emperor Tenji but was popularised in the 12th century as large-scale mounted warfare became more common. However, the comparative scarcity of horses in Japan meant that bajutsu was always an elite art, restricted to high-ranking samurai. In spite of this, many contemporary historians ignored the numbers of foot-soldiers in battles and referred to the size of armies by the number of horsemen alone.\n\nThe comparative peace of the Tokugawa era from 1600 onwards led to a decline in the military practice of bajutsu, and it became relegated to a more ceremonial role, indeed, the practice of horsemanship was actively discouraged during the reign of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi. By the beginning of the 20th century there were more than 20 schools of bajutsu and the Japan Bajutsu Federation was formed in Tokyo in 1946 to promote it as a modern sport.\n\nAs well as requiring proficiency in riding and mounted sword-fighting, the art also included teachings on the care and upkeep of horses. Horses were trained to ignore sudden shocks, and to press forward in the charge, veering off at the last second to allow the rider to kick with his battering-ram-like stirrups. These stirrups (\"shitanaga abumi\") were designed to enable the rider to stand and shoot easily from the saddle. Cavalry charges were made possible by the development of spear techniques from horseback in the late 14th century, supplanting the mounted archery styles that had previously dominated. Such charges were used to great effect by the Takeda clan, who introduced the tactic during the mid- to late- sixteenth century, but after the Battle of Nagashino, were used only in conjunction with infantry manouevres.\n"}

It is also known by its English name, the \"World Underwater Federation\", and its Spanish name, \"Confederacion Mundial De Actividades Subacuaticas\". Its foundation in Monaco during January 1959 makes it one of the world's oldest underwater diving organisations.\n\nAn international congress of diving federations representing all underwater disciplines met in Brussels on 28 September 1958. National\ndelegates attended from following countries: Belgium, Brazil, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy, Monaco, Portugal, Switzerland, the United States of America and the former Yugoslavia. Following a decision at that congress, a meeting was held in Monaco on 9–11 January 1959, which officially established the World Underwater Federation, with an acronym based on its French title as \"CMAS\".\n\nA founding member and key proponent of \"CMAS\" was the French underwater explorer and diving pioneer Jacques-Yves Cousteau who was chosen to be the inaugural president with Luigi Ferraro, Italian underwater pioneer, appointed as vice-president.\n\nCMAS succeeded the \"Comité des Sports Sous-Marins\" (Underwater Sports Committee) of the Confédération Internationale de la Pêche Sportive (CIPS) (International Confederation of Sport Fishing), which was founded on 22 February 1952.\n\nCMAS consists of three major committees - sport, technical and scientific. These committees are overseen by a board of directors (BoD) elected periodically at the annually convened general assembly. The BoD, the sport committee and the scientific committee oversee sub-committees known as commissions. Day-to-day operation is overseen by a steering committee appointed from the BoD. Its headquarters is currently located in Rome.\n\nThe steering committee consists of seven members. As of 2013, the members were:\n\nThe sports committee consists of commissions representing the following underwater sports - apnoea, aquathlon, finswimming, spearfishing, sport diving, underwater hockey, underwater orienteering, underwater rugby and underwater target shooting. An additional commission known as \"visual\" represents the sports of underwater photography and underwater video. All of those sports are governed at the international level uniquely by CMAS with exception of apnoea in which competition and governance is also provided by a rival organisation, AIDA International.\n\nThe role of the technical committee is the provision of \"safe diving for CMAS members\" and seeks to achieve this by \"promoting world class standards for all aspects of Scuba Diving and ensuring adherence of them by member federations and dive providers\". Its officers who are elected from persons nominated at the CMAS General Assembly by affiliated national diving federations include the following positions - president, secretary, standards director, education director, technical director, diving security director, special tasks director and a number of general members.

While organisations like PADI or SSI tend to bring divers into the water immediately, CMAS entry-level training is more extensive, featuring more \"classroom\" delivered theory.\n\nThe CMAS Technical Committee has developed a qualification system currently known as the \"CMAS International Diver Training Standards\" which consists of published universal standards for recreational diving, technical diving and leadership diver grades.\n\nThe CMAS Technical Committee has also developed a diving certification system called the \"CMAS International Diver Training Certification System\" for most of its diver training standards and which permits divers that have been trained in accordance with the CMAS International Diver Training Standards, to have their training recognised worldwide particularly in countries where CMAS affiliated federations exist. The system includes a double sided certification card format where one side depicts the achieved CMAS standard while the other side has details of the issuing organisation and the diver.\n\nCMAS itself does not provide training or conduct the issuing of certifications - this is available from two sources. Firstly, from national diving federations affiliated to the CMAS Technical Committee using their member diving clubs, their member instructors where the federation is exclusively an instructor organisation or by agreement with independent underwater diving training organizations operating in the countries where those federations are based. Secondly, from specially accredited dive centres known as \"CMAS Dive Centers\" (CDC) who use dedicated CMAS training materials.\n\nStandards are offered for recreational diver training for the following grades of snorkel and scuba divers.\n\nStandards are provided for the following speciality training for recreational divers:\n\nStandards are provided for the following technical diver training grades:\n\nStandards are provided for the training of the following grades of recreational snorkel and scuba instructors:\n\nStandards are provided for speciality training of assistants, dive supervisors, snorkel instructors and scuba instructors:\n\nThe committee considers its main task is to bring to the attention of the world underwater diving community, the important issues concerning the marine environment and how divers can play a major role in protecting it by serving as frontline observers of its overall health, particularly in respect to invasive species, coastal ecosystems and biodiversity.\nIts officers who are elected from persons nominated at the CMAS General Assembly by affiliated national diving federations include the following positions - president, secretary, a number of general members and presidents of the following commissions - marine biology, marine archaeology, geology and professional relationships.\n\nOver a 10-year period from 1977, it was responsible for the development of the \"Code of Practice for Scientific Diving\" for UNESCO in cooperation with Sea Grant. \n\nThe CMAS Scientific Committee oversees a system of diving standards and certification that operates in parallel to the CMAS International Diver Training Certification System.\nThe system was developed to which recognize the status of a diver who is qualified to dive in the course of research whilst employed. This internationally recognized standard of competence is a distinct advantage for working scientists who wish to travel between laboratories and institutes in different countries.\nKnown as the CMAS Scientific Diver Standard, the system consists of the following diver and instructor grades:\nA programme of specialist courses both at entry and advanced levels in underwater archaeology, freshwater biology, marine biology, marine geology and oceanology is also offered.\nTraining and certification (also known as brevets) for the above qualifications is available from organisations known as CMAS Scientific Centres (CSC).\n\nOrganisations which recognise CMAS as the international federation for underwater sport and activities include:\n\n\n\nCMAS membership consists of at least 130 national federations from five continents including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13143446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13143446", "title": "Flowriding", "text": "Flowriding\n\nFlowriding (or Flowboarding) is a late-20th century alternative boardsport incorporating elements of surfing, bodyboarding, skateboarding, skimboarding, snowboarding and wakeboarding.\n\nFlowriders ride on artificial waves that are technically called \"sheet waves\". Powerful pumps project a three-inch layer of water at speeds ranging from 20 MPH to 30 MPH. The water flows up and over surfaces engineered to replicate the shape of ocean waves. Sheet waves are stationary waves, in that the wave does not move forward, and the movement is derived from water flowing over a stationary surface. Flowriders get their speed from the energy of the water flowing at them, and can perform basic to sophisticated turns and tricks within a relatively small area.\n\nEven though there are a number of different types of structures used for flowriding, the two which are recognized at a competitive level are the WhiteWater West Single and Double FlowRiders and the WhiteWater West FlowBarrel.\n\nThe sports has two main divisions, based on the type of board: the flowboard and the bodyboard.\n\nThe flowboard is also known as the 'stand-up board' in flowriding. Currently there are three mainstream board brands: Outlaw, ShuvIt and Carve. These boards differ in shape, materials, lengths and the angle at which the board curves. Generally they take a similar appearance to that of a wakeboard and can be further categorized into strapped and strapless boards. Boards with footstraps are generally used only on the FlowBarrel, but strapless boards are used on both the FlowRider and FlowBarrel. Flowboards range in length from: 910 millimeters (36 inches) to 1070 millimeters (42 inches); and in width from 280 millimeters (11 inches) to 356 millimeters (14 inches). They weigh between 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) and 2.8 kilograms (6 pounds)\n\nMany of the tricks incorporated in flowriding are inspired by skateboarding and wakeboarding. Riders are able to perform various maneuvers varying in difficulty such as carving, rotations varying in degree (90°, 180°, 360°), pop-shuvits and variations, kick-flips, foot-plant and fast-plant variations, and many more.\n\nBodyboarders ride standard bodyboards in the prone, kneeling, or drop-knee position. Each position forms the basis for its own set of tricks. In most competitions, bodyboarders are required to do tricks in both prone and kneeling positions. There are four brands most would look to for bodyboards; Custom X and World Class Bodyboards\n\nThe Flowboarding League of the World (or FLOW), run by WhiteWater West Inc, hosts flowboarding competitions. They regularly host the North American Flow Tour, Flow Tour Asia, Flow Tour Europe, as well as the World Flowboarding Championship, with occasional Special Events as well.\n\nCurrently there are two main categories of competitions in the United States, The North American Flow Tour Prime Events as well as Flow Series events. Both hold contests at different venues around the country. Competitors compete in divisions by age and gender and are generally given three 30-45 second judged runs and the best two are counted. Past reputable judges have included Sean Silveira, JP O'Brien, Eric Silverman, Chuck Wright, Theo Koby, Nick Sanchez, Adam Muller, Brad Spencer as well as many others. There are also two main categories of competitions in the United Kingdom, European Flow Tour and UK Flow Tour.\n\n"}
{"id": "428681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=428681", "title": "Forward (association football)", "text": "Forward (association football)\n\nForwards are the players on an association football team who play nearest to the opposing team's goal, and are therefore most responsible for scoring goals.\n\nTheir advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players.\n\nModern team formations generally include one to three forwards; for example, the common 4–2–3–1 formation includes one forward. Unconventional formations may include more than three forwards, or none.\n\nThe traditional role of a centre-forward is to score the majority of goals on behalf of the team. The player may also be used to win long balls or receive passes and retain possession of the ball with their back to goal as teammates advance, in order to provide depth for their team or help teammates score by providing a pass ('through ball' into the box); the latter variation usually requiring quicker pace and good movement. Most modern centre-forwards operate in front of the second strikers or central attacking midfielders, and do the majority of the ball handling outside the box. The present role of centre-forward is sometimes interchangeable with that of an attacking midfielder, especially in the 4–3–1–2 or 4–1–2–1–2 formations. The term \"target man\" is often used to describe a particular type of striker whose main role is to win high balls in the air and create chances for other members of the team (not necessarily scoring many goals themselves). These players are usually tall and physically strong, being adept at heading the ball. The term centre-forward is taken from the early football playing formation in which there were five \"forward\" players: two outside forwards, two inside forwards, and one centre-forward.\n\nWhen numbers were introduced in the 1933 English FA Cup final, one of the two centre-forwards that day wore the number nine – Everton's Dixie Dean a strong, powerful forward who had set the record for the most goals scored in a season in English football during the 1927–28 season. The number would then become synonymous with the centre-forward position (only worn that day because one team was numbered 1–11 whilst the other was numbered 12–22).\n\nThe role of a striker is rather different from that of a traditional centre-forward, although the terms centre-forward and striker are used interchangeably at times, as both play further up the field than other players, while tall, heavy and technical players, like Zlatan Ibrahimović, have qualities which are suited to both positions. Like the centre-forward, the traditional role of a striker is to score goals; strikers are therefore known for their ability to peel off defenders and to run into space via the blind side of the defender and to receive the ball in a good goalscoring position, as typified by Ronaldo. They are typically fast players with good ball control and dribbling abilities. More agile strikers like Michael Owen have an advantage over taller defenders due to their short bursts of speed. A good striker should be able to shoot confidently with either foot, possess great power and accuracy, and have the ability to link-up with teammates and pass the ball under pressure in breakaway situations. While many strikers wear the number 9 shirt, the position, to a lesser degree, is also associated with the number 10, which is frequently worn by more creative deep-lying forwards such as Pelé, and occasionally with numbers 7 and 11, which are often associated with wingers.\n\nDeep-lying forwards have a long history in the game, but the terminology to describe their playing activity has varied over the years. Originally such players were termed inside forwards, creative or deep-lying centre-forwards. More recently, two more variations of this old type of player have developed: the second, or shadow, or support, or auxiliary striker and, in what is in fact a distinct position unto its own, the number 10, exemplified by Dennis Bergkamp (who would play just in behind the striker Thierry Henry at Arsenal). Other number 10s who play further back, such as Diego Maradona, Ronaldinho and Zinedine Zidane, are often described as an attacking midfielder or the playmaker.\n\nThe second striker position is a loosely defined and most often misapplied description of a player positioned somewhere between the out-and-out striker, whether he is a \"target-man\" or more of a \"poacher\", and the Number 10 or attacking midfielder, while possibly showing some of the characteristics of both. In fact, a coined term, the \"nine-and-a-half\", has been an attempt to become a standard in defining the position. Conceivably, a Number 10 can alternate as a second-striker provided that he is also a prolific goalscorer; otherwise, a mobile forward with good technical ability (dribbling skills and ball control) and link-up play, who can both score and create opportunities for a less versatile centre-forward, is more suited. Second or support strikers do not tend to get as involved in the orchestration of attacks as the Number 10, nor do they bring as many other players into play, since they do not share the burden of responsibility, functioning predominantly as assist providers. In Italy, this role is known as a \"rifinitore\" or \"seconda punta\", whereas in Brazil, it is known as \"segundo atacante\" or \"ponta-de-lança\".\n\nThe position of inside forward was popularly used in the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries. The inside forwards would support the centre-forward, running and making space in the opposition defence, and, as the passing game developed, supporting him or her with passes. The role is broadly analogous to the \"\"hole\"\" or \"second striker\" position in the modern game, although here there were two such players, known as inside right and inside left.\nIn early 2–3–5 formations the inside-forwards would flank the centre-forward on both sides. With the advent of the \"WM\" formation, the inside forwards were brought back to become attacking midfielders, supplying balls to the centre-forward and the two attacking Outside forwards – known as the \"outside right\" and \"outside left\".\n\nIn the modern game, inside forwards have either been pushed up front to become out-and-out attackers (in 4–3–3 formations) or one has been switched back into midfield and the other up front (in 4–4–2). Many teams, however, still employ one of their strikers in a withdrawn role as a support forward for the main striker, in a role broadly similar to the inside forward.\n\nAn outside forward plays as the advanced forward on the right or left wing – as an outside right or outside left, typically as part of a 2–3–5 formation or one of its variants. As football tactics have largely developed, and wingers have dropped back to become midfielders, the terminology has changed and \"outside forward\" has become a historical term. Many commentators and football analysts still refer to the wing positions as \"outside right\" and \"outside left\".\n\nThe responsibilities of an outside forward include but are not limited to:\n\nDue to these responsibilities some of the most important attributes include:\n\nA winger is an attacking player who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines. They can be classified as forwards, considering their origin as the old \"outside-forward\" position, and continue to be termed as such in most parts of the world, especially in Latin and Dutch footballing cultures. However, in the British game (in which the 4–4–2 formation and its variants are most commonly used) they are usually counted as part of the midfield.\n\nIt is a winger's duty to beat opposing full-backs, deliver cut-backs or crosses from wide positions and, to a lesser extent, to beat defenders and score from close range. They are usually some of the quickest players in the team and usually have good dribbling skills as well. In their Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese usage, the defensive duties of the winger have been usually confined to pressing the opposition fullbacks when they have the ball. Otherwise, a winger will drop closer to the midfield to make himself available, should his team win back the ball.\n\nIn British and other northern European styles of football, the wide-midfielder is expected to track back all the way to his own corner flag should his full-back require help, and also to track back his marker, as well as tucking into the midfield when the more central players are trying to pressure the opposition for the ball, a large responsibility for attack-oriented players, and particularly those like Joaquín (winger/wide midfielder), Cristiano Ronaldo (winger/striker) or Ryan Giggs and John Barnes (winger/central midfielder) who lack the physical attributes of a wing-back or of a more orthodox midfield player. As these players grow older and lose their natural pace, they are frequently redeployed as Number 10s between the midfield and the forward line, where their innate ball control and improved reading of the game in the final third can serve to improve their teams' attacking options in tight spaces. An example is Inter Milan's use of veteran Luís Figo behind one or two other attackers, as a second striker or attacking midfielder.\n\nIn recent years there has been a trend of playing inverted wingers – wide men stationed on the 'wrong' side of the pitch, in order to enable them to cut inside and shoot on their stronger foot and sometimes provide in-swinging crosses. This tactic was used by Frank Rijkaard, who whilst at Barcelona, moved Lionel Messi from the left flank onto the right wing, initially against the player's wishes, allowing him to cut into the centre and shoot or cross with his left foot.\n\nThe false 9, in some ways similar to a more advanced attacking midfielder/playmaker role, is an unconventional lone striker or centre-forward, who drops deep into midfield. The purpose of this is that it creates a problem for opposing centre-backs who can either follow the false 9, leaving space behind them for onrushing midfielders, forwards or wingers to exploit, or leaving the false 9 to have time and space to dribble or pick out a pass.\n\nThe term comes from the traditional number for center-forwards (nine), and the fact that normally a centre-forward traditionally stayed near the line of defenders until they got an opportunity to move past them toward goal.\n\nKey attributes for a false 9 are similar to those of a deep-lying striker; dribbling ability to take advantage of space between the lines, good short passing ability to link up with the midfield and vision to play through teammates making runs from deep to goal.\n\nThe first false 9 in a World Cup was Juan Peregrino Anselmo in the Uruguay national team, although he could not play the match against Argentina in the 1930 World Cup due to injury. Matthias Sindelar was the false 9 of the \"Wunderteam\", the Austria national team, in 1934. A false 9 was also utilized by Hungary during the beginning of the 1950s, with striker Nándor Hidegkuti acting in the role.\n\nRoma under manager Luciano Spalletti used Francesco Totti, nominally an attacking midfielder or \"trequartista\", up-front in an innovative \"4–6–0\" formation; this was met with a run of 11 consecutive victories.\n\nAt Euro 2012, Spain manager Vicente del Bosque, although sometimes using a typical striker in Fernando Torres, used a false 9 in Cesc Fàbregas in several matches, including the final. By the end of 2012, the False 9 had gone \"mainstream\" with many clubs employing a version of the system. Barcelona's Lionel Messi has been an exponent of the false 9 position to much success in recent years, first under coach Pep Guardiola and later under his successor Tito Vilanova.\n\nOne approach to stop false 9s has been to create congestion in the midfield by bringing several players back into a more defensive role in an attempt to deny them space needed to create plays, notably in José Mourinho's \"parking the bus\" strategy.\n\nA strike team is two or more strikers who work together. The history of football has been filled with many effective combinations. Three-man teams often operate in \"triangles\", giving a wealth of attacking options. Four-man packages expand options even more.\n\nStrikers must also be flexible, and be able to switch roles at a moment's notice, between the first (\"advanced penetrator position\"), second (\"deep-lying manoeuvre\") and third (\"support and expansion, e.g. wings\") attacker roles.\n\nAnother example was the Total Football played by the Dutch team in the 1970s, where the ability of their players, and in particular Johan Cruyff, to swap positions allowed a flexible attacking approach which opposition teams found difficult to effectively mark.\n\n"}

{"id": "4113951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4113951", "title": "Player-coach", "text": "Player-coach\n\nA player-coach (also playing coach, captain-coach, or player-manager) is a member of a sports team who simultaneously holds both playing and coaching duties. A player-coach may be a head coach or an assistant coach. They may make changes to the squad and also play on the team.\n\nVery few current major professional sports teams have head coaches who are also players, though it is extremely common for senior players to take a role in managing more junior athletes. Historically, when professional sports had much less money to pay players and coaches or managers, it was much more common to find them. Likewise, where player-coaches exist today, they are more common at the lower levels where money is less available, but not exclusively.\n\nThe player-coach was, for many decades, a long-time fixture in professional basketball. Many notable coaches in the NBA served as player-coaches, including Bill Russell and Lenny Wilkens. This was especially true up through the 1970s, when the league was not as financially successful as it is today, and player-coaches were often used to save money. The practice fell out of favor in the 1980s (though Mike Dunleavy Sr., while an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks, once came out of retirement and played several games when a rash of injuries decimated the team). Today, the collective bargaining agreement between the NBA and the players' union prohibits the use of player-coaches, in order to avoid circumventing the league's salary cap, as coaches' salaries are not counted under the cap. Therefore, if a player is to serve as a coach, he would have to receive commission from his contract as a player. The player, then, is not technically an official coach of his team but instead simply a coach in name. One example of a player in recent years who was groomed for eventual official coaching duties using this practice was Avery Johnson.\n\nIn the early days of professional American football, player-coaches were a necessity, as coaching from the sidelines at the time was not allowed under the rules of most leagues. The National Football League eventually allowed sideline coaches in the late 1920s, and they quickly became the norm. During the 1920s, legendary player-coaches in the NFL include Curly Lambeau (who played for the Green Bay Packers from 1919–1929, and served as their head coach from 1919–1949) and George Halas who held similar roles for the Chicago Bears, a team for which he was also part-owner and business manager. Jimmy Conzelman was player-coach for four teams during the 1920s. In the mid-1950s Tom Landry played defensive back while serving as defensive coordinator for the New York Giants. In the early 1970s, when Landry was coach of the Dallas Cowboys, he made running back Dan Reeves a player-coach. More modern players have acted as player-coaches in an unofficial capacity, such as journeyman quarterback Steve DeBerg, who served as an unofficial mentor for younger, more skilled arms while also serving as their backup.\n\nPlayer-coaches in cricket are almost unheard of, although professional coaches are a relatively recent innovation and a similar role was generally filled by the team captain; this may still be the case in amateur competition. Internationally, Shane Deitz was appointed non-playing coach of Vanuatu in 2014 and, after meeting the necessary residency qualifications, made his international playing debut in 2018, at the age of 42. Similarly, former Australian international Ryan Campbell was appointed as a non-playing batting coach of Hong Kong in 2013, and after meeting the residency qualifications made his playing debut for Hong Kong in 2016, at the age of 44.\n\nIn association football, this situation usually arises when a manager leaves a team suddenly, and the chairman has to make a quick decision to appoint someone new as a caretaker manager. The chairman will usually either ask a coach to take temporary charge or turn to one of the club's most senior players. If this particular player gains good results for the team during his time in charge, he may be appointed full-time manager, which leaves him a player–manager. However, there are instances when a free agent is appointed by a new team as a manager and offers his playing abilities.\n\nSuccessful football player–managers include Kenny Dalglish (Liverpool), Graeme Souness (Rangers), Glenn Hoddle (Swindon Town and Chelsea), Bryan Robson (Middlesbrough), Peter Reid (Manchester City), Ruud Gullit (Chelsea) and Gianluca Vialli (Chelsea). Dalglish won the double of the league title and FA Cup in his first season as player-manager, and went on to win two more league titles and an FA Cup before giving up playing completely five years after becoming manager, while Souness won three Scottish league titles and several cup competitions when he was player-manager of Rangers. He then succeeded Dalglish as Liverpool manager just before Rangers won another Scottish league title, but at the age of 38 he did not register himself as a player for Liverpool. In 1997, Ruud Gullit won the FA Cup with Chelsea in his first season as player-manager, also making history by being the first foreign and non-white manager to win a major trophy in English football. He was sacked nine months later, and Chelsea appointed another player-manager (Gianluca Vialli) in his place. Within weeks of taking over, Vialli guided Chelsea to victory in the League Cup, and two months after that, they won the European Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nA number of bigger clubs have appointed player-managers on a temporary basis but not given them permanent contracts. Notable cases include Ossie Ardiles (Tottenham Hotspur) in 1987 and Dave Watson (Everton) a decade later, although Ardiles later returned to Tottenham as manager in 1993 after managing three other clubs. During the first decade of the 21st century, however, the concept gradually fell into almost total disuse and was normally only practiced by smaller clubs. In March 2013, a \"BBC Sport\" article suggested that the concept of having a player-manager had gone out of fashion, with only two clubs in the English professional leagues using player-managers at that time.\n\nThe chief executive of the League Managers Association stated his belief that the increased workload for managers had made combining the two roles difficult. The last permanent player-manager in the top flight of English football was Gianluca Vialli, who retired from playing in 1999 when he was the manager of Chelsea. The governing bodies have also imposed requirements for managers to hold professional coaching qualifications, which few players obtain before retiring.\n\nThere have been four player-managers in the Premier League since 2000: Stuart McCall, who managed two Bradford City games on an interim basis in late 2000, Garry Monk, who was appointed interim player-manager of Swansea City in February 2014, after their manager, Michael Laudrup, was sacked, and Leon Britton who also became player-manager of Swansea City after the sacking of Paul Clement. Ryan Giggs was appointed player-coach at Manchester United by David Moyes on 4 July 2013 and Giggs served as interim player-manager until the appointment of Louis van Gaal on 9 May 2014 as manager following Moyes' dismissal. On the 6 May 2014, in what turned out to be his final game as a player, Ryan Giggs substituted himself on against Hull in the closing minutes at the age of 40.\n\nWhile no Major League Baseball (MLB) team has been led by a player-manager since 1986, they were once quite common. Cap Anson, Connie Mack, John McGraw, Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker, Joe Cronin, Mickey Cochrane, Lou Boudreau, Joe Torre, and Frank Robinson are among those who spent time as player-managers. In this capacity, Robinson became the first African-American manager in MLB history when he was named the Cleveland Indians' player-manager in . Fred Clarke spent the longest time as a major league player-manager, serving as such for the Louisville Colonels from to and the Pittsburgh Pirates from to .\n\nThe most recent player-manager in MLB was Pete Rose, who, upon being traded from the Montreal Expos to the Cincinnati Reds in August , was immediately named the Reds' manager. Rose managed and served as a backup infielder until the end of the season, when he retired as a player. (He continued to manage the Reds until when he was suspended indefinitely by MLB for gambling on baseball.)\n\nIn , Chicago White Sox general manager Kenny Williams said that he had considered making veteran first baseman Paul Konerko a player-manager to replace departing manager Ozzie Guillén. Williams instead hired retired player Robin Ventura for the position.\n\nIn their final game of the season, the Miami Marlins allowed Martin Prado to serve as player-manager. Prado started the game at third base and played for three innings before taking himself out of the game.\n\nMajor league rules are somewhat different for trips to the mound by the manager if he is a player-manager (this is with regard to being required to change pitchers), and a player-manager puts himself into or out of the lineup just as he would any other player.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5214067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5214067", "title": "Towel Power", "text": "Towel Power\n\nTowel Power is a term used by the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) to describe the waving of rally towels by their fans. The tradition started in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals when Vancouver played the Chicago Blackhawks. During game two of the series, head coach Roger Neilson waved a white towel on the end of a hockey stick in a mock surrender after being upset with the officiating. Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost 4–1. When Vancouver returned home from Chicago for the following game fans supported both Neilson and the Canucks by waving towels first at the airport when the team arrived and then during the next game. The Canucks won the next three games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they were defeated by the New York Islanders. As part of the tradition, the Canucks hand out towels prior to playoff games for fans to help support the team.\n\nLate in the 1981–82 season the Vancouver Canucks played a game against the Quebec Nordiques in Quebec City. During the game Canucks' enforcer, Tiger Williams was punched by a fan. In response Canucks' head coach Harry Neale went into the crowd to \"get the fan\" and a few players followed suit. For his actions NHL President John Ziegler suspended Neale for eight games. Neale's suspension began with four games remaining in the season and assistant coach Roger Neilson took over the head coaching duties for Neale. Vancouver finished the year with a 30–33–17 record, second in the Smythe Division and qualified them for the playoffs. Neale's suspension then carried over for the first four games. Despite the losing record the Canucks finished the year with an eight-game unbeaten streak, which continued into their first round match-up with the Calgary Flames. Vancouver swept the Flames in three straight games advancing to the second round where they faced the Los Angeles Kings. With Canucks' General Manager Jake Milford retiring and Neale set to replace him, Neale told Milford to keep Neilson as head coach for the remainder of the playoffs, believing the team had bonded under his guidance. With Neilson remaining as head coach, the Canucks eliminated the Kings in five games and advanced to the Campbell Conference Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nVancouver won the first game of the series in Chicago 2–1 in double overtime, but fell behind in game two 3–1. During the game the Canucks felt that referee Bob Myers was making questionable calls against them. A series of events in the third period ignited tempers. First, Vancouver had a goal disallowed. Soon after, there was a perceived non-call against Chicago, followed by a fourth consecutive penalty called against the Canucks. Denis Savard scored on the power play to put the Black Hawks up 4–1. This enraged the Canucks' bench. Assistant coach Ron Smith yelled out \"We give up, we surrender, we give up.\" Williams suggested to Neilson that he throw sticks onto the ice in protest. Neilson noted that he had done that before, and he had a better idea. He proceeded to take a white towel and place it on the end of a hockey stick holding it up in a mock surrender; some of the Canucks' players followed suit.Neilson was ejected from the game along with two players. Vancouver goaltender, Richard Brodeur later noted that although they lost the game the atmosphere in the dressing room was so positive it was as if they had won.\n\nNeilson was fined $1,000 and the franchise was fined $10,000 as a result of the incident. Myers later called Nielson's action \"bush league\". While NHL executive vice-president Brian O'Neill stated that the mock surrender \"disgraced the championship series,\" Canucks' captain, Stan Smyl, noted that several players were \"surprised\" by Nielson's action because the coach had always been \"respectful\", and it was an \"extreme way for him to react\".\n\nWhen the Canucks returned home, they were greeted by fans at the airport waving towels in support of the team. During game three, fans waved towels to show support for the Canucks. Former professional football player, wrestler, and five time world belly flop champion Butts Giraud got permission from the team to start selling towels with the phrase \"Canucks Take no Survivors\". He initially had 5,000 of them made at $1 apiece and sold 1,000 of them right away, proceeds going to charity. Giraud would sell 30,000 towels personally, the proceeds for charity amounted to $23,000. Vancouver won game three 4–3 to take the lead in the series. For game four there were more fans waving towels as the Canucks won again 5–3. Vancouver won game five in Chicago and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were swept by the New York Islanders.\n\nTo continue the tradition, the organization produces 20,500 white towels with the Canucks logo for each playoff game. Following his first playoff game in 2007 Vancouver forward Alex Burrows stated \"It looks like the fans are really into the game and the atmosphere out there is something else, people are really passionate instead of just sitting and no one moving or anything like some places. It just creates movement and it seems like there is more enthusiasm and intensity in the building.\" As part of their 40th season celebration the Canucks organization commissioned a permanent statue of Nielson. Standing over 11 feet tall and weighing over 800 pounds the bronze statue depicts Nielson's mock surrender which started towel power.\n\nThe first use of rally towels in professional sports was the Pittsburgh Steelers football team's Terrible Towel, in 1975. Minnesota Twins first used Homer Hanky towels in 1987. In recent years, other NHL hockey teams have used rally towels at home games, including the Anaheim Ducks Fowl Towels.\n\n"}

Filters cleanse water to different extents for purposes such as providing agricultural irrigation, accessible drinking water, public and private aquariums, and the safe use of ponds and swimming pools.\n\nFilters use sieving, adsorption, ion exchanges and other processes to remove unwanted substances from water. Unlike a sieve or screen, a filter can potentially remove particles much smaller than the holes through which its water passes.\n\nTypes of water filters include media filters, screen filters, disk filters, slow sand filter beds, rapid sand filters, cloth filters, and biological filters such as algae scrubbers.\n\nPoint-of-use filters for home use include granular-activated carbon filters (GAC) used for carbon filtering, depth filter, metallic alloy filters, microporous ceramic filters, carbon block resin (CBR), microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes. Some filters use more than one filtration method. An example of this is a multi-barrier system. Jug filters can be used for small quantities of drinking water. Some kettles have built-in filters, primarily to reduce limescale buildup.\n\nStandard Flowmatic cartridge style filters are added to existing plumbing; the filter cartridges are cylinders long by in diameter. They are made by multiple manufactures and are available in 0.5-100 micron ratings as well as activated carbon.\n\nSome common substances that filtration does not remove are arsenic, bacteria, chlorides, fluoride, nitrates, perchlorates, pharmaceuticals, sodium and viruses.\n\nWater filters are used by hikers, aid organizations during humanitarian emergencies, and the military. These filters are usually small, portable and lightweight (1-2 pounds/0.5-1.0 kg or less), and usually filter water by working a mechanical hand pump, although some use a siphon drip system to force water through while others are built into water bottles. Dirty water is pumped via a screen-filtered flexible silicon tube through a specialized filter, ending up in a container. These filters work to remove bacteria, protozoa and microbial cysts that can cause disease. Filters may have fine meshes that must be replaced or cleaned, and ceramic water filters must have their outside abraded when they have become clogged with impurities.\n\nThese water filters should not be confused with devices or tablets that disinfect water which remove or kill viruses such as hepatitis A and rotavirus.\n\nThree organizations are accredited by the American National Standards Institute, and each one of them certified products using American National Standard Institute/National Science Foundation standards. Each American National Standards Institute/National Science Foundation standard requires verification of contaminant reduction performance claims, an evaluation of the unit, including its\nmaterials and structural integrity, and a review of the product labels and sales literature. Each certifies that home water treatment units meet or exceed National Standard Institute/National Science Foundation and Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards. American National Standard Institute/National Science Foundation standards are issued in two different sets, one for health concerns (such as removal of specific contaminants (Standard 53, Health Effects) and one for aesthetic concerns (Aesthetic Effects, such as improving taste or appearance of water). Certification from these organizations will specify one or both of these specific standards.\n\nNSF International as it is now known started out as the National Sanitation Foundation in 1944 at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. The NSF's water treatment Device Certification Program requires extensive product testing and unannounced audits of production facilities. One goal of this not for profit organization is to provide assurance to consumers that the water treatment devices they are purchasing meet the design, material, and performance requirements of national standards.\n\nUnderwriters Laboratories, Inc., is an independent, accredited testing and certification organization that certifies home water treatment units which meet or exceed EPA and American National Standard Institute/National Science Foundation drinking water standards of contaminant reduction, aesthetic concerns, structural integrity, and materials safety.\n\nThe Water Quality Association is a trade organization that tests water treatment equipment, and awards its Gold Seal to systems that meet or exceed ANSI/NSF standards for contaminant reduction performance, structural integrity, and materials safety.\n\nFilters that use reverse osmosis, those labeled as “absolute one micron filters,” or those labeled as certified by an American National Standards Institute (ANSI)- accredited organization to American National Standard Institute/National Science Foundation Standard 53 for “Cyst Removal” provide the greatest assurance of removing Cryptosporidium. As with all filters, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for filter use and replacement.\n\nThe term water polishing can refer to any process that removes small (usually microscopic) particulate material, or removes very low concentrations of dissolved material from water. The process and its meaning vary from setting to setting: a manufacturer of aquarium filters may claim that its filters perform water polishing by capturing \"micro particles\" within nylon or polyester pads just as a chemical engineer can use the term to refer to the removal of magnetic resins from a solution by passing the solution over a bed of magnetic particulate. In this sense, water polishing is simply another term for whole house water filtration systems. Polishing is also done on a large scale in water reclamation plants.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, water filters for domestic water production were generally divided into slow sand filters and rapid sand filters (also called mechanical filters and American filters). While there were many small-scale water filtration systems prior to 1800, Paisley, Scotland is generally acknowledged as the first city to receive filtered water for an entire town. The Paisley filter began operation in 1804 and was an early type of slow sand filter. Throughout the 1800s, hundreds of slow sand filters were constructed in the UK and on the European continent. An intermittent slow sand filter was constructed and operated at Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1893 due to continuing typhoid fever epidemics caused by sewage contamination of the water supply. The first continuously operating slow sand filter was designed by Allen Hazen for the city of Albany, New York in 1897. The most comprehensive history of water filtration was published by Moses N. Baker in 1948 and reprinted in 1981.\n\nIn the 1800s, mechanical filtration was an industrial process that depended on the addition of aluminium sulfate prior to the filtration process. The filtration rate for mechanical filtration was typically more than 60 times faster than slow sand filters, thus requiring significantly less land area. The first modern mechanical filtration plant in the U.S. was built at Little Falls, New Jersey for the East Jersey Water Company. George W. Fuller designed and supervised the construction of the plant which went into operation in 1902. In 1924, John R. Baylis developed a fixed grid backwash assist system which consisted of pipes with nozzles that injected jets of water into the filter material during expansion.\n\n"}

Among the other players were: Mara Lakić, Zorica Dragičević, Naida Hot, Smilja Rađenović, Ilvana Zvizdić, Jadranka Savić, Vesna Pođanin, Dragana Jeftić and Stojanka Došić. The most famous ex-coach is Mihajlo Vuković.\n\nThe club was founded in 1945 immediately after the liberation of Yugoslavia in World War II, the same as its male counterpart KK Sloboda Dita.\n\nThe club was amateur since its inception, in the early 1970s. The club played in the second Yugoslav Basketball League, with mediocre results until season 1979/1980, when they were promoted to the first Yugoslavian Basketball League. However, they were relegated the following year. The club got back into the first league in season 1982/1983, where they finished in eighth position and were secure from relegation.\n\nThe club kept growing and getting better and better results, until winning the title in season 1986/1987.\n\nIn season 1987/1988 Jedinstvo played in Europe for the first time. They beat Arama Ankara in the Qualification round, and after that they beat Universitatea Cluj in First round, and got into Group, where they finished third. In home competition they weren't dominant as year before but they managed to secure title in Play Offs after third game.\n\nIn the season that followed in 1987/1989, Jedinstvo was once again representative of Yugoslavia in Euroleague and they won competition over Vicenza, but they failed to clinch the domestic title after finishing regular part of season as first.\n\nIn season 1989/1990, Jedinstvo won its last Yugoslavia title, and finished second placed in Ronchetti Cup.\n\nIn season 1990/1991 the team played in Euroleague, and they finished fifth in Yugoslav League short of two games. Which was last Yugoslavian Basketball season.\n\nJedinstvo plays its games in SPKC Mejdan in Tuzla, usually in small arena, that has capacity of 600.\n\n\n\n\n"}
