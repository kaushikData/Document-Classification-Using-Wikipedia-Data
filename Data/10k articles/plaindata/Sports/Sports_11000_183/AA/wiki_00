Some aussieBum lifestyle and apparel products are manufactured overseas in Vietnam, Thailand and Bangladesh. All products are designed and despatched from Sydney, with the business run completely out of the company's headquarters in the suburb of Leichhardt.\n\nIn 2001, director Sean Ashby started aussieBum when he couldn’t find the style of nylon swimmers he grew up with. The company had an inauspicious launch in the middle of the dot-com bust, and at the time the original website ran from a suburban lounge room, created by Ashby.\n\nSince starting out with only A$20,000 in 2001, aussieBum is now a multi million-dollar global enterprise, still manufacturing over 1 million mens underwear and swimwear garments in New South Wales Australia annually and now manufacturing apparel overseas also.\n\nThe company has no sales representatives overseas but relies on the strength of the company website. Australian sales make up only 10% of its business, and is on its way to A$20 million in annual sales. The company has a broad reach for a business run entirely via the Web, with no shop front and minimal packing staff.\n\nThe brand retails in some of the biggest department stores in the world such as Selfridges, Harrods and House of Fraser in the UK, Printemps in Paris, KaDeWe in Berlin, and Harvey Nichols in Dubai, as well as in small boutiques in various cities around the world. aussieBum's online store ships to more than 150 countries with free delivery.\nAussieBum promotes their products on various social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. The brand has a popular online following with the \"aussieBum\" being the 7th most popular search term in Australia. Cultivating the image of a larrikin Australian has also helped the company in getting noticed in overseas markets where residents are curious about Australian culture.\n\nThe brand uses a distinctly cheeky advertising style, such as remaking the iconic Australian painting \"Shearing the Rams\" with muscle-bound men shearing sheep in just their underwear.\n\nCelebrities including Ewan McGregor, Billy Connolly, and Daniel Radcliffe are fans of aussieBum. Soccer superstar and men's fashion trendsetter David Beckham has also appeared in the brand.\n\nAussieBum swimwear has been featured in music video clips \"Slow\" by Kylie Minogue and \"SuperMartXé VIP\"\n\nIn 2011, during the first episode of The Celebrity Apprentice Australia, director Sean Ashby gave $50,000 to charity when politician Pauline Hanson washed his car wearing aussieBum underwear, plus an additional $10,000 for Deni Hines to sing the national anthem.\n\nIn November 2006, the Wonderjock was launched in the aussieBum underwear lines. Wonderjocks have been designed to \"lift\" and \"enhance\" a man's genitals, through the use of a fabric cup used to protrude everything out instead of just down. 50,000 pairs of the new underwear were sold in the first seven days of being released. The name was chosen as a pun on the popular Wonderbra line of women's push-up bras.\n\nIn May 2007, the company also introduced Wonderjock technology into their swimwear line. Currently in the Classic, Storm, Precision and Loose varieties, a fabric pouch is used to enhance a man's package, particularly when getting out of cold water. Since their release the Wonderjock styles have been altered and renamed Boosterjock, with the new design giving a more natural shape and less restrictive feel than the earlier version.\n"}

{"id": "3301457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3301457", "title": "Brockville Park", "text": "Brockville Park\n\nBrockville Park was a football stadium located on Hope Street in Falkirk, Scotland, north-west of the town centre. It was the home of Falkirk F.C. from 1885 until the end of 2002–03 Scottish football season. The record attendance at Brockville Park was 23,100 on 21 February 1953 in a match against Celtic. Nowadays the stadium has since been replaced with a Morrisons supermarket. An old turnstile is on display next to the supermarket's car park.\n\nThe main stand was situated to the west of the pitch and was mostly for home supporters and directors, with a small part towards the north end allocated to away fans. The Cooperage Lane terracing was to the south of the pitch and was for home supporters. The Watson Street terracing was to the north of the pitch and was for away fans. Part of the Watson Street end was closed in latter years as it failed to gain a safety certificate. The Hope Street end was divided into home and away fans separated by a metal 'cage'.\n\nFalkirk were denied promotion to the Scottish Premier League on several occasions due to regulations and criteria which Brockville Park did not meet. The most recent was in the 2002–03 season when Falkirk, despite winning the First Division, were refused entry to the SPL. In preparation for winning the First Division that season, and the prospect of promotion, Falkirk started talks with several clubs over a ground-sharing partnership for the 2003-04 season. However, the SPL criteria stated at the time that ground-sharing was prohibited for clubs in the Premier League so Falkirk remained in the First Division and tried to make a ground-share agreement whilst Brockville Park was demolished. Two potential partners were Airdrie United with their Excelsior Stadium and Clyde with their ground of Broadwood Stadium in nearby Cumbernauld, a third option was to share Ochilview Park with local rivals Stenhousemuir and eventually an agreement was made for Falkirk to play their home games at Ochilview for one season.\n\nIn 2001, when Recreation Park, the home of Alloa Athletic was deemed unsuitable by police to host a match against Celtic due to its small capacity, Brockville Park was chosen as the venue for the Scottish Cup third-round tie. This was met with criticism from both clubs over the Scottish Football Association and their decision because the ground lacked under-soil heating, which was significant because the match was scheduled to be played in January at the height of winter. Another argument was that a previous match between Alloa and Celtic was relocated to Partick Thistle's Firhill Stadium in Glasgow, which is an all-seater stadium. Alloa Athletic's manager at the time, Terry Christie, had shown confusion to why the Scottish Cup tie was not also hosted at a similar venue, rather than Falkirk's Brockville Park, which contained terracing and was not an all-seater stadium.\n\nBrockville Park was demolished towards the end of 2003, having remained largely unchanged for decades, and was considered unsafe to host matches in the Scottish Premier League due to its largely terraced spectator areas. The site was then sold to supermarket chain Morrisons who built a new branch in place of Brockville Park. The supermarket contains memorabilia commemorating Falkirk's history at Brockville Park. An old turnstile from the stadium is located just outside the supermarket. The club ground-shared with local rivals Stenhousemuir at Ochilview Park for the 2003–04 football season whilst their new home, the Falkirk Stadium was being constructed. In 2004 Falkirk moved to their newly built stadium on the outskirts of the town.\nBrockville Park became the second of three greyhound racing venues in Falkirk; the first was Firs Park. Racing took place from 16 July 1932 until 15 May 1935. The racing ended due to competition from the nearby new custom built Diamond Stadium/Brockville Greyhound Racecourse.\n\nIt cost an estimated £10,000 to build the greyhound track around the football pitch in 1932 and the management joined the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS), an organisation formed to assist tracks wishing to race under regulations and a rival to the bigger National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC). The Brockville Park management led by Racing Manager Captain John Hill O.B.E (also a qualified vet) had purchased the greyhounds from the Crewe sales one week before the opening night. A six race card with tote betting only, formed the first meeting but that would be increased to eight races at a later date. The runners were cared for by former Firs Park trainer William Hay who would take over from Captain Hill the following year. The biggest event held at the track was called the Falkirk Greyhound Derby and racing sometimes took place immediately after football matches. The hope that the racing would ease the financial problems of Falkirk FC never materialised and it ended in 1935.\n\n"}

Frawley Stadium is a stadium in Wilmington, Delaware. It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of the Wilmington Blue Rocks minor league baseball team. The park was originally known as Legends Stadium when it was built in 1993. It was renamed in 1994 for Wilmington mayor Daniel S. Frawley, who had pushed for a return of the Blue Rocks. The field is named separately for Judy Johnson, a local Negro league baseball star.\n\nThe stadium was designed by architect Trish England, head of Design Exchange, who had previously designed dozens of commercial buildings in Delaware. Construction began on November 1, 1992 and was headed by contractor Matthew Minker, a part owner of the team. The stadium site was once part of a Christina River shipbuilding operation. In 1986, the Dravo Shipyard, with several buildings, was bought by Verino Pettinaro, a local contractor, for a little more than $1 million. Mr. Pettinaro sold for the stadium to the Delaware Stadium Corporation for $300,000. The Delaware Stadium Corporation, a city and state entity, has owned the stadium since its construction.\n\n The stadium seats 6,404 people. The Blue Rocks have a picnic area in the stadium named the Blue Moose Grill and a gift shop, The Quarry.

{"id": "1372385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1372385", "title": "Double check", "text": "Double check\n\nIn chess, a double check is a check delivered by two pieces simultaneously. In chess notation, it is almost always represented the same way as a single check (\"+\"), but is sometimes symbolized by \"++\" (however, \"++\" is also sometimes used to denote checkmate).\n\nThe most common form of double check involves one piece moving to deliver check and revealing a discovered check at the same time from a piece it had been blocking. (Such a check is an inherent part of the type of smothered mate known as \"Philidor's legacy\".) The only possible replies to a double check are king moves, as both checking pieces cannot be captured or blocked at once. In some cases, the king can capture one checking piece and escape the other in a single move.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, it is possible for the moved piece to not participate in the double check (i.e. to give a \"double discovered check\", though this name is not actually used). The only way for this to happen in orthodox chess is by way of an \"en passant\" capture. In the position shown, Black has just played 1...g7–g5. White replies 2.hxg6++. The result is a double check even though the pawn White moved does not give check (one check is given by the rook, discovered by the capturing pawn's move; the other by the bishop, discovered by the captured pawn's removal). Such a double check is extremely rare in practical play, but is sometimes found in problems.\n\nAron Nimzowitsch wrote, \"Even the laziest king flees wildly in the face of a double check.\" Because the only possible response to a double check is a king move, the double check is often an important tactical motif. A famous example is Réti–Tartakower, Vienna 1910, which arose after 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Qd3 e5 6.dxe5 Qa5+ 7.Bd2 Qxe5 8.0-0-0 Nxe4 9.Qd8+ (sacrificing a queen in order to set up a double check) Kxd8 10.Bg5++ and White mates after 10...Ke8 11.Rd8# or 10...Kc7 11.Bd8#.\n\nA double check was also seen in the celebrated Evergreen Game, Anderssen–Dufresne, 1852. Anderssen won with 20.Rxe7+! Nxe7 21.Qxd7+!! (a queen sacrifice to set up a deadly double check) Kxd7 22.Bf5++ Ke8 (or 22...Kc6 23.Bd7#) 23.Bd7+ Kf8 24.Bxe7#.\nIn chess with variant rules or fairy pieces, other ways of delivering a double check may be possible. Triple, quadruple and even quintuple checks may also be possible. For example, in the position shown, after Black plays 1...d5, White plays 2.exd6e.p. quintuple check (the \"moa\" is a non-leaping knight which first takes a diagonal step, then an orthogonal one). After the \"en passant\" capture, five pieces check the black king: both moas, the rook, the grasshopper and the bishop.\nIn xiangqi, the Chinese version of chess, triple check and even quadruple check is possible even without using fairy pieces, as in the following examples:\n"}
{"id": "6368582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6368582", "title": "Dynamic rope", "text": "Dynamic rope\n\nA dynamic rope is a specially constructed, somewhat elastic rope used primarily in rock climbing, ice climbing, and mountaineering. This 'stretch' is what makes it 'dynamic', in contrast to a static rope that has very low elongation under load. Greater stretch allows a dynamic rope to absorb the energy of a sudden load such as from a fall more slowly, reducing the peak force and therefore the chance of catastrophic failure. Kernmantle ropes are the most common type of dynamic rope, and nylon has replaced all natural materials such as hemp (Manila rope) since 1945 for durability and strength.\n\nDynamic climbing ropes are classified into three categories: Single ropes, twin ropes, and half ropes (also referred to as 'double ropes').\n\n\nBoth twin and half ropes have the advantage of redundancy, as well as allowing a rappel along the full length of the climbing rope (by tying both ropes together), so that climbers can descend from a long multipitch route with fewer rappels than with a single rope. Some ropes are 'triple rated', meeting the standards for all three rope types, so they can be used in each configuration.\n\nDynamic ropes used for rock climbing come in a variety of lengths and diameters, with the most common lengths being , , . Lengths will vary depending on rope maintenance and age, and there are even ropes as long as 80 meters for specialized ascents on routes that would normally require a multi-pitch climbing attempt due to being only slightly longer than a standard rope length.\nRope diameters are generally between 8.3mm and 11.5mm, with the different diameters used for slightly different purposes. Sport and multi-pitch trad climbers often value thinner ropes because they are lighter, and have less rope drag. Thinner ropes also run more smoothly through belay devices, especially assisted braking devices or 'tube-style' devices operated in 'guide mode', which can be tedious to pull thicker or stiffer rope through. Lighter, thinner ropes, however, have less strength than a thicker rope and will sustain fewer hard falls. Note that some belay devices are better suited for different rope diameters. This is particularly relevant with assisted braking devices, such as the Petzl Grigri (which, for example, works best with a 9.4-10.3 mm thick line) or the Faders SUM. Users must make sure to read the instructions for the device carefully to ensure safety and recognize any limitations to rope diameter.\n\nAll modern rock climbing dynamic ropes rated by the UIAA must meet certain standards and pass testing for Construction, Sheath Slippage, Static Elongation, Impact Force on first fall, and Number of falls held. The force rating indicates the maximum amount of force the rope can deliver to a falling climber, measured in kilonewtons (kN), under test conditions designed to simulate a hard fall; typical climbing ropes range from 9kN up to an Arborist's 24kN. The force rating is often misunderstood by climbers, because all other climbing gear is rated by the breaking strength (in kN) of the material. Whereas a higher rating (indicating greater strength) is desired for other gear, for dynamic ropes a lower rating is generally desired, as this indicates it would give a 'soft catch' that is less likely to injure the climber or break or dislodge protection or anchors.\n\nUnlike most climbing equipment, dynamic ropes do not have a rated tensile breaking strength. Instead, the strength of a rope is tested by the number of standard test falls a rope can sustain before breaking. The test falls use an 80 kg weight for single ropes (55 kg for half ropes), and a fall factor of 1.7 (4 meter fall on 2.3 meters of rope). This tests simulates a very hard fall that would rarely occur. When climbing, it is possible to produce a fall factor as high as 2, however, real-world climbing situations include additional shock absorbing elements which are not included in the test standard, such as the body of both the climber and belayer, elasticity of their harnesses and anchor materials, and friction between the rope and the belay device, and any protection pieces. Single ropes must sustain at least 5 such falls before breaking, and a rope that can sustain more than 9 falls is considered a 'multifall' rope. In practice, climbing ropes rarely if ever break due to a fall alone- all documented rope failures involve the rope being cut or damaged, for example by abrasion against a sharp rock edge. Ropes are especially vulnerable to being cut while they are weighted with the body of the climber, and moving over a sharp edge (for example if a following climber is resting his weight on the rope, or using the rope for assistance, while swinging or traversing under a roof, while being belayed from above). In general, thicker ropes will be stronger and more durable, and have a higher fall rating.\n\nModern ropes are made from nylon and don't require a great deal of maintenance. Ropes that are frequently used are often inspected for cuts, abrasions, or frayed areas; any cut or fraying that passes into the core of the rope is cause for concern. Ropes can also be washed to clean them of any extensive dirt or grime.\n\nEvery fall lessens the amount of impact a rope can later absorb, and hard falls can seriously compromise the strength of a rope, without showing obvious signs of wear. One definition of a 'hard fall' is a long fall (> 10–15 meters) with a fall factor greater than one. Manufacturers often recommended that ropes be retired if they sustain an extremely hard fall, even if they do not show outward signs of wear.\n\n\n\n"}

The film presents Wakefield's chase of his 200th win as a member of the 2011 Red Sox and Dickey’s make-it-or-break-it season with the 2011 Mets.

{"id": "5092775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5092775", "title": "Lilleshall Hall", "text": "Lilleshall Hall\n\nLilleshall Hall is a large former country house and estate in the fields of Lilleshall, Shropshire, England.\n\nIt is run by Serco Leisure Operating Ltd on behalf of Sport England as one of three National Sports Centres, alongside Bisham Abbey and Plas y Brenin. It lies between Telford and Newport.\n\nThe core of the Lilleshall estate, which amounts to , was originally the demesne of Lilleshall Abbey, an Augustinian foundation of the 12th century. The ruins of the original Lilleshall Abbey are protected today by English Heritage. The estate was granted after the Dissolution of the Monasteries to James Leveson, a Wolverhampton wool merchant, in 1539. His family, including Walter Leveson and Vice-Admiral Richard Leveson, the last of his direct line, lived in a lodge in the grounds, although they were only occasionally resident in Lilleshall, as they had many other houses. The estates passed to Richard Leveson, a distant cousin who was a prominent Royalist in the English Civil War and fortified the Abbey, inviting a severe bombardment. As he too failed to produce heirs, Lilleshall then passed to Sir William Leveson-Gower, 4th Baronet, founder of an illustrious political dynasty, who married Lady Jane Granville, daughter of the Earl of Bath.\n\nThe first of the family to be ennobled, in 1703, was John Leveson-Gower, 1st Baron Gower. His son and grandson, John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower, and Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford, progressed further up the ranks of the English peerage and it was probably the latter who converted a 17th-century house, in the village of Lilleshall itself, into a country residence in the late 1750s. The lodge lingered on, in a deteriorating state, until 1818, when it was demolished.\n\nGeorge Granville Leveson-Gower after his marriage in 1765, considered even the mid-18th century Hall too small but it was not until the 1820s that his wife instructed the architect Jeffry Wyatville and local builders to commence work on the present Hall. It was constructed beyond the eastern end of the original estate, in the parish of Sheriffhales, although still called Lilleshall Hall. It was completed in 1829, three years before the newly elevated Duke of Sutherland's death. The Hall was scheduled in 1984 as a Grade II* listed building. The former Lilleshall Hall, in the village, was at first retained by the family, probably as a dower house, before being sold in 1930.\n\nThe approach to the estate from the main Wolverhampton to Chester Road is through the \"Golden Gates\", an exact replica of those adorning Buckingham Palace. The gardens include many bridges, the original canal, an ornamental garden, a Grecian temple, ponds and the Apple Walk (about half its original pergola length). The high obelisk was built in 1833 in memory of the 1st Duke of Sutherland and designed by G.E. Hamilton.\n\nIn 1914, a year after the 5th Duke succeeded to the seat at the age of 25, he decided on the outbreak of the First World War that it was unwise to have so much of his riches tied up in land and property. He sold the entire estate except the Hall and of gardens, with less than being purchased by Wrekin College. He then decided he wanted to live closer to London and sold the remainder of the estate in 1917 to Sir John Lee.(Sir John Leigh). \n\nHerbert Ford was a local man who acquired his wealth from the industry of the Ironbridge Gorge, added to by his marriage to Alice Perrins of the Lea and Perrins Worcester Sauce fame. In 1927 he bought the estate and decided on a business plan based on an \"early Stately Home\". From 1930 until 1939, the Hall had pleasure gardens for the public, including an amusement park, a narrow gauge railway, tea dances, and children's playgrounds. He added an additional nine holes on the existing nine-hole golf course, designed by the noted golf course architect, Harry Colt, which later became the Lilleshall Hall Golf Club. However, it was not played on for 20 years owing to a rent dispute with farmers that resulted in cattle on the course. He even increased attendance by advertising that the German airship Hindenburg would fly over the estate even when its route was nowhere near; he explained that the lack of an airship was due to bad weather in a self-sent telegram.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War the pleasure gardens closed, an air raid bunker was built and wooden classrooms erected. This accommodated both Cheltenham Ladies' College and later Dr Barnardo's, who used the facilities as an orphanage. The land and gardens were intensively farmed throughout this period.\n\nMany estates were left in ruin after World War II and Lilleshall was no exception. Repairing them to pre-World War II state was expensive and the social revolution that had occurred meant they were very much more expensive to run. Mr Ford struggled on but in 1949, the Central Council of Physical Recreation were seeking a second National Recreation Centre to serve the North of England to complement Bisham Abbey in the South.\n\nIn 1949, a sale was agreed for £30,000 for the Hall and , made possible by a financial gift from the people of South Africa to Clement Attlee's government. Mr Ford then gave another on condition he and his family could stay in residence for at least another ten years or until his death.\n\nThe sports centre was opened in 1951 by HM Queen Elizabeth II (then HRH the Princess Elizabeth). Jim Lane, a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club became the first warden. He started a number of cricketing courses and the first Conference of cricket coaches was held there in December 1951. Annual summer schools were held from July until September for the governing bodies of many major sports, including cricket, archery, athletics, fencing, judo, weightlifting, basketball, soccer, netball, and tennis.\n\nIn 1974 the centre was handed to the Sports Council by the Central Council of Physical Recreation.\n\nFollowing the success of the summer schools, sports' governing bodies came to look upon Lilleshall as their own national and regional coaching or squad training centre. In twenty-one years as a National Recreation Centre, the English governing bodies of cricket, Rugby League and Rugby Union, lawn tennis, badminton, hockey, lacrosse, netball, the Professional Golfing Association and Association Football selected Lilleshall for its facilities and convenience for players meeting up from around the country to train:\n\nThe centre also possesses:\n\nThe Football Association's School of Excellence was established at Lilleshall in 1984 and closed in the summer of 1999. During the mid-1980s to mid-1990s the England Team often trained at the centre, however, today most Premiership football clubs have now established their own centres of excellence based on the Lilleshall model. The school came in for some criticism due to its centralist and perceived anti-club agenda but its star pupils included future England internationals Jermain Defoe, Michael Ball, Michael Owen, Joe Cole, Scott Parker, Sol Campbell, Jamie Carragher, Wes Brown, Nick Barmby, Andrew Cole and Ian Walker.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24073423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24073423", "title": "Line in the sand match", "text": "Line in the sand match\n\nThe line in the sand match is the unofficial title given to the round 11, 2004 match between Australian Football League (AFL) clubs and , which was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday, 5 June 2004.\n\nA number of incidents in the third quarter led to some fights breaking out all over the ground, eventually turning into a five-minute melee involving all players on the ground. Following the brawl, Essendon kicked fourteen goals to Hawthorn's six to record a 74-point win.\n\nEighteen players faced charges at the AFL Tribunal from the match on 8 and 9 June 2004, with record suspensions and fines handed out.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Hawthorn experienced a golden era, making every Grand Final from 1983 to 1989 and again in 1991, and were victorious on five occasions.\n\nDuring this time, they came up against the Bombers on three occasions – 1983, 1984 and 1985. The Hawks comfortably won in 1983 and the Bombers followed up with back-to-back wins in 1984 and 1985. Throughout this decade, both clubs were known to play hard, attacking brands of football resulting in lots of biffs, bumps and brawls.\n\nEssendon continued to intimidate opposition clubs in the 1990s and into the early years of the 21st century, resulting in more premiership success in 1993 and 2000, and a dominant era over Hawthorn. Essendon entered the match having won nine of the previous ten meetings between the two clubs, by an average margin of 39 points. They were also heavy favourites to win this match, having a 7–3 win–loss record for the season and were considered a top-four contender, while Hawthorn was bottom of the ladder with only two wins.\n\nHawthorn players were allegedly directed at half time, by club director Dermott Brereton who played for the Hawks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to \"draw a line in the sand\" and take a physical stand against the Bombers to make it clear that they would not take the intimidation any longer. Brereton denied the allegation but admitted to advising senior players \"to stand up to any Essendon aggression\".\n\nWithin the first two minutes of the third quarter, Mark Williams kicked Hawthorn's sixth goal of the match to cut Essendon's lead to 26 points.\n\nFollowing the centre bounce, several players were on the ground vigorously attempting to gain possession of the ball and clear it for their team. Mark Johnson of Essendon attempted to join in at a stoppage but was quickly removed by a number of Hawthorn players. This led to some wrestling and jumper punches amongst the players, with approximately 16 players in the centre square at the time. Channel Ten commentators said that the spirit was \"bubbling over a little\".\n\nA free kick was awarded to Hawthorn and the ball was quickly kicked forward. The Hawks were unable to take a mark inside their forward 50 and the ball fell into Mark Bolton's hands who was able to clear for the Bombers. He kicked the ball along the southern side of the ground with the aim of reaching Jason Winderlich who, while attempting to mark close to the ground, copped a very hard knock from Hawthorn's Chance Bateman, possibly a knee or hip connecting with his head. A free kick was awarded to Winderlich who was forced from the ground under the blood rule.\n\nA number of brawls broke out on the Great Southern Stand side of the centre square with many players getting involved. Players tackled each other to the ground, threw fist and jumper punches and wrestled with each other with Hawthorn's Richie Vandenberg and Lance Picioane particularly active and Essendon's Adam McPhee, Mark Johnson and Justin Murphy were keen to respond. As Winderlich continued off the ground in the arms of trainers he was struck by Campbell Brown of Hawthorn, an act which was described by Essendon forward Matthew Lloyd after the match as \"one of the most disgusting things I've seen on a football field\". Channel Ten commentators described it as \"the 1980s revisited\", \"unbelievable\" and stated \"we haven't seen these sort of scenes for a long time in AFL football\". Trainers, runners and some senior players were seen restraining and dragging their club's players away from opposition players, while McPhee had to be restrained and given marching orders from Bruce Connor, Essendon's head physiotherapist, to receive attention to a bloodied eye.\n\nA few follow-up scuffles occurred but Essendon regained composure and hit back hard on the scoreboard, kicking nine of the next ten goals to extend the three-quarter time lead to 74 points. A 10-goal final quarter, five to each team, left the margin as it was at three-quarter time, with the Bombers recording a 74-point win.\n\nThe fallout from the match was significant, with a record 18 players reported on a record 26 charges. Some players were reported by umpires on the field, while the rest were cited on video evidence by Video Reports Officer Ian Robinson and after an investigation conducted by the AFL's Investigations Officer Rick Lewis.\n\nThe Tribunal decisions were severe with five players suspended for a combined total of 16 matches and players involved in the melee fined a combined total of $70,700, the most from a single match in VFL/AFL history, and described by Tribunal Chairman Brian Collis, QC, as bringing \"football into disrepute\".\n\nRichard Vandenberg, Lance Picioane, Campbell Brown and Simon Beaumont were suspended for a combined total of 15 matches and melee fines totalled $36,700:\n\nJustin Murphy was suspended for 1 match and melee fines totalled $34,000:\n\nBoth teams struggled for the remainder of the season. Hawthorn did not win another match until round 19, and finished the season with four wins, narrowly avoiding the wooden spoon to on percentage. Essendon, meanwhile, won just four more matches for the regular season to qualify for the finals, in eighth place. They defeated fifth-placed by five points in the first elimination final, but then lost to Geelong by ten points the following week.\n\nIn the years following this match, the clubs' fortunes reversed sharply. Essendon dropped to 13th the following season, missing out on the finals for the first time since 1997, and would not make another finals series until 2009, doing so after they defeated Hawthorn by 17 points in the final round of the 2009 season. It still, however, managed a two-point win over the Hawks early in the 2005 season, courtesy of a controversial goal to Dean Solomon; it marked the Bombers' tenth consecutive victory over the Hawks dating back to 1998. Following that, Essendon would not beat Hawthorn again until round seven, 2009, but would beat the Hawks three consecutive times within twelve months, including a resounding 43-point victory in round six, 2010, in which the Hawks copped criticism for a performance described as \"embarrassing\".\n\nHawthorn, meanwhile, gradually started to rise up the ladder under new coach Alastair Clarkson, reaching the semi-finals in 2007 and winning the premiership the following year; it has subsequently won three more premierships, in succession between 2013 and 2015.\n\nThe clubs have maintained a strong rivalry, but only one match has turned particularly violent since: in the final round of the 2009 season, with the two sides battling for eighth place on the ladder, a brawl was sparked by a remonstration from a head-high shirtfront from Essendon captain Matthew Lloyd on Hawthorn midfielder Brad Sewell at the start of the third quarter, which was to be the turning point in the match. Essendon won by 17 points after trailing by 22 points at the time of the Lloyd-Sewell incident.\n\n\n"}

It opened in December 2000, with expansions opening in March and May 2001. The complex consists of: a multipurpose arena, science centre and shopping centre. The shopping centre houses a movie theatre and bowling alley, alongside a selection of restaurants.\n\nThe Odyssey Centre was 50% funded by a £45m grant from the Millennium Commission as part of the Landmark Project for Northern Ireland with matched funding from the Department of Education Northern Ireland, the Sheridan Group and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland. The application to the Millennium Commission was led by the Ulster Museum, who wished to develop a science centre and teamed up with Peter Curistan who wished to develop an IMAX, and then led the development of the Arena with L&R leisure who were the consultants. The name \"Odyssey\", was to symbolise the 'journey of discovery' that would be the science centre and Michael Montgomery, a young 14 year old at the time came up with the name. The complex adopted the name, and the Science Centre became W5.\n\nThe arena opened in 2000, W5 on 31 March 2001 with the Pavilion opening a few months later. The Odyssey is quoted to have cost £120 million on completion. Odyssey was held in Trust by the Odyssey Trust Company with leases to SMG/Sheridan for the Arena, Sheridan for the Pavilion and the National Museums NI for W5. In 2011 Odyssey Trust took over the Arena. In 2011 The Odyssey Pavilion which was owned by The Sheridan Group went into administration, and the building went under control of KPMG temporarily until the energy company SSE purchased it. It is managed by The Odyssey Trust.\n\nFormerly the Odyssey Arena from 2000 to 2015.

W5 was developed by Dr Sally Montgomery, the Ulster Museum's Project Director (and then founding CEO) with the exhibitions being designed by Hands On Inc, Florida USA and Ontario Science Centre, Canada. W5 has roughly 250 interactive exhibits, along with 6 themed exhibitions, in 3500 sq metres of exhibition space, workshop space and lecture theatre.\n\nW5 was a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Museums Northern Ireland until 31 March 2012 when it became a subsidiary of Odyssey Trust.

The plans include 800 residential units, two hotels, a promenade, shops, additional leisure facilities and a multi-storey car park. \n\nOn 29 November 2013, the owners of the Odyssey won planning permission for an extension to include hotels, shops and apartments creating around 1,000 new jobs. Work is due to start immediately, with around 800 people set to work on construction of the scheme – described as the biggest redevelopment in Belfast in years. Odyssey Trust's plan is to build next to the existing Odyssey Arena and Pavilion as part of the restart of the Belfast master plan.\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that Planning Permission had been submitted to transform the Complex in a £10m refurbishment. Plans include a new entrance to the Odyssey Pavilion, upgrade of Public Realm and reconfiguration of existing retail units. Phase two will see improved visitor access and greater use of the central open space.\n\nThe Odyssey was short-listed for 'International Large Venue of the Year' (Outside of North America) in the 2005 Pollstar Concert Industry Awards, making it one of the top six major concert venues in the world.\n\nThe SSE Arena is located in the Titanic Quarter, just a 10/25minute walk from the City Centre.

The name Qhubeka means \"to move forward\" in Nguni, and as of 2014 the charity had delivered over 45,000 bicycles. Qhubeka provides bicycles for children to attend schools, and for adults to attend work, with estimates suggesting a 75% reduction in commuting time and 23% higher attendance at schools for people given a bicycle by the Qhubeka. In order to be given a bicycle, the recipients are first required to take bicycle safety and maintenance training courses. The organisation also donates one bicycle for every 100 trees grown, or for every ton of rubbish collected. \n\nIn 2013, the organisation became part of the World Bicycle Relief, and in November 2013, RCS Sport, the organisers of the Giro d'Italia, donated 58 bicycles to Qhubeka. In 2014, Qhubeka encouraged people to ride for 67 minutes and donate R67 on Mandela Day, and the Berg and Bush mountain bike race in KwaZulu-Natal chose Qhubeka as their charity to support. In 2015, the organisation donated 5,020 bicycles, and in June 2016 100 bicycles were donated by Auto Trader.\n\nIn 2011, MTN Group changed the name of their UCI Continental Team from Team MTN to MTN-Qhubeka, in order to promote the organisation.

{"id": "1170510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1170510", "title": "Riverside International Raceway", "text": "Riverside International Raceway\n\nRiverside International Raceway (sometimes known as Riverside, RIR, or Riverside Raceway) was a motorsports race track and road course in the Moreno Valley area, a suburb just east of Riverside, California. Riverside was a hot, dusty place. It was at times, also a dangerous place, yet it is remembered with affection by drivers and fans alike, as the home of road racing in southern California. It was also considered one of the USA's finest tracks.The track was in operation from September 22, 1957, to July 2, 1989, with the last race, The Budweiser 400, won by Rusty Wallace, held in 1988. After that final race, a shortened version of the circuit was kept open for car clubs and special events until 1989. \n\nIn the beginning it was originally called The Riverside International Motor Raceway. It was built in early 1957 by a company called West Coast Automotive Testing Corp.. The head of West Coast Auto Testing was a man by the name of Rudy Cleye, from Los Angeles, who had previously raced in Europe. However the building of the raceway met with funding difficulties early on and a businessman by the name of John Edgar provided a much needed cash bailout. This action prevented any halt in the track's construction.\n\nThe first weekend of scheduled races in September 1957, a California Sports Car Club event, John Lawrence of Pasadena, California, lost his life. Lawrence, a former Cal Club member, piloting a 1500 cc Production champion, went off at Turn 5 (later designated Turn 8). With no crash barrier in place, and no rollbar on the car, Lawrence's MGA went up the sand embankment, then rolled back onto the track. Though Lawrence survived the incident, and appeared only slightly injured, he died later at the hospital of a brain injury.\n\nThe second major event at the track, in November 1957, was a sports car race featuring some of the top drivers of the day, including Carroll Shelby, Masten Gregory and Ken Miles. Another driver entered was an inexperienced local youngster named Dan Gurney, who had been offered the opportunity to drive a powerful but ill-handling 4.9-liter Ferrari after better-known drivers such as Shelby and Miles had rejected it. Shelby led early but spun and fell back. Gurney assumed the lead and led for much of the event. Shelby, driving furiously to catch up, finally overtook Gurney late in the race and won. Gurney's performance caught the eye of North American Ferrari importer Luigi Chinetti, who arranged for Gurney to drive a factory-supported Ferrari at Le Mans in 1958, effectively launching the Californian's European career.\n\nFootage exists of classic races like the 1986 Los Angeles Times Grand Prix in which the Chevy Corvette of Doc Bundy, attempting a three-wide pass, hit the Ford Probe of Lyn St. James and the Jaguar of Chip Robinson at Turn 1. St. James' car caught fire and Chip Robinson nearly cartwheeled into the crowd. St. James survived the flames and Robinson escaped uninjured within the track bounds.\n\nThe track was known as a relatively dangerous course, with its long, downhill back straightaway and brake-destroying, relatively slow 180-degree Turn 9 at the end. During the 1965 Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race, Indycar great A. J. Foyt suffered a brake failure at the end of the straight, shot off the road and went end-over-end through the infield at high speed. Crash crews assumed Foyt was dead at the scene, until fellow driver Parnelli Jones noticed a twitch of movement. Ford factory sports car driver Ken Miles was killed there in a testing accident in August 1966 when his Ford sports car prototype (known as the J-car) became aerodynamically unstable and flew out of control at the end of the back straight. In December 1968, American Formula 5000 champion Dr. Lou Sell crashed and overturned in Turn 9 on the first lap of the Rex Mays 300 Indianapolis-style race, suffering near-fatal burns. In January 1967, Canadian driver Billy Foster crashed at Turn 9 during a practice-session just prior to the start of qualifying for the Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race. These accidents and others caused track management to reconfigure Turn 9, giving the turn a dogleg approach and a much wider radius (a water improvement also closed the raceway for a few months).\n\nIn January 1964, Riverside also claimed the life of 1962–'63 NASCAR champion Joe Weatherly, who refused to wear a shoulder harness and wore his lap belt loosely. Weatherly died when he lost control entering Turn 6, hitting the steel barrier almost broadside and had his head snapped out the window against the barrier.\n\nNevertheless, in 1983 Turn 9 was the site of the only fatality in IMSA GTP history. In the 1983 Times Grand Prix, Rolf Stommelen's Joest-constructed Porsche 935 lost its rear wing at the Dogleg and hit two freeway-type barriers sending it into a horrific roll at Turn 9.\n\nWhen the racetrack was proposed in the mid-1950s, Riverside International Motor Raceway (as it was called at the time) was planned to ultimately be long, but the club extension was never constructed and the track's final length (after Turn 9 was adjusted in 1969, engineered by David Berg, to a 10 degree banked sweeper) was .\n\nIn January 1964, Riverside also claimed the life of 1962–'63 NASCAR champion Joe Weatherly, who refused to wear a shoulder harness and wore his lap belt loosely.

In 1966 Dan Gurney tested his first Eagle racing car on a shorter, counter-clockwise version of the track tailored specifically for his car's Indianapolis-specific left-turn oiling system. The test caused Gurney to ask track president Les Richter to hold an Indianapolis-style race there. From 1967 to 1969 the Rex Mays 300 served as the season-ending USAC Indianapolis-car race.\n\nESPN taped the June 12, 1988, Budweiser 400 race at RIR and caught racer Ruben Garcia crashing hard off turn 9 and his car went through two cement barriers before coming to rest near a catch fence where fans were sitting. He was not injured, though, and neither were the race fans.\n\nAfter 14 years of NASCAR as a driver and later a car owner, Richard Childress won his first NASCAR race in 1983, when Ricky Rudd drove his #3 Piedmont Airlines Chevrolet to victory in the 1983 Budweiser 400k.\n\nFrom 1981 until 1987, NASCAR's championship race was at Riverside. The USAC Championship Trail also held their season ending race from 1967 to 1969.\n\nRiverside was home to track announcer Sandy Reed and (along with former LA Rams player Les Richter) Roy Hord Jr.\n\nNASCAR Team owners Roger Penske and Rick Hendrick drove a select few races at Riverside in their own cars. Penske won a Winston West race in 1963, while In the final race in 1988, Hendrick got out of the car and let Elliott Forbes-Robinson take over. \n\nThe Winston Western 500 came to be known as the signature event at the track. Initially (1963-1981) this race was held in January as the Winston Cup Series season opener, but beginning in 1982 NASCAR elected to start the season with the Daytona 500. From 1981-1987 the Winston Western 500 was held in November as the final race of the season.\n\nRiverside also hosted drag racing events. Between 1961 and 1969, the Hot Rod Magazine Championship Drag Races, \"one of the most significant drag racing events\" of that era, were held at RIR. The championship offered a US$37,000 prize, greater even than a National Hot Rod Association national event prize at the time.\n\nThe track was built to accommodate several different configurations, depending on the type of car and race length. The three options on Riverside Raceway were the long course (), the short course (), and the NASCAR () course. The original racetrack had a backstretch from 1957 to 1968. When the track was redesigned in 1969, Turn 9 was reconfigured with a wider radius and banked with a dogleg approach added, to reduce strain on the cars' brakes. The fourth track configuration was a drag racing strip.\n\nBefore a racing event at RIR, track crews added traffic pylons to close off sections of the track. The closed sections were determined by the specific course and cars used during any given race. \n\nThroughout it's history, various other track configurations were used to adapt the track for events such as off-road and motorcycle events.\n\nDiagram notes: The long course had the backstretch between turns 8 & 9. This version was used primarily for the \"Los Angeles Times\" Grand Prix, although the long course was also used for Indy car racing in the mid-1980s. When the 1969 version was built, the dogleg was added so as to ease the transition into Turn 9 (the track had seen numerous brake failure-induced accidents approaching Turn 9, and this change was made as a safety measure).<br> In the short course, the track would use turn 7A rather than 8. The \"Turn 7-7A\" configuration effectively shortened the back straight to just over one-half mile in length. The NHRA drag strip ran south to north on the backstretch from the runoff to the Bosch Bridge (not shown in diagram), which crossed over the track about halfway between turns 8 & 9. \n\nDue to its proximity to the Southern California entertainment industry, RIR was a frequent filming location for Hollywood movies, television series and commercials.\n\nScenes from the television shows \"CHiPs\", \"Simon and Simon\", \"The Rockford Files\", \"Knight Rider\", and the HBO program \"Super Dave Osborne\" were shot on location at RIR. The television movie adaptation of \"Gemini Man\", \"Riding With Death\", featured as an experiment on the television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", also contains footage of racing at Riverside.\nRIR was extensively featured in the 1961 telefilm \"The Quick and the Dead,\" an episode of the series \"Route 66\". The episode stars Martin Milner and George Maharis, and guest stars Harvey Korman, Regis Toomey, and Betsy Jones-Moreland. Milner races a 1960 powder-blue Chevrolet Corvette in the film.\n\nFilm shoots at RIR included scenes from: \"Good Guys Wear Black\" (1978) \"The Betsy\" (1978), \"Fireball 500\" (1966), \"Grand Prix\" (1966), \"The Killers\" (1964), \"The Love Bug\" (1968), \"On the Beach\" (1959), \"Roadracers\" (1959), \"Speedway\" (1968), \"Stacey\" (1973), \"Thunder Alley\" (1967), \"Winning\" (1969), and \"Viva Las Vegas\" (1964).\n\nThe track was used in Sierra Entertainment's \"NASCAR Legends\", \"NASCAR Heat\" and later was converted to \"NASCAR 4\", \"NASCAR Racing 2002 Season\", \"2003\" and \"rFactor\".\n\nRiverside has also been featured in \"\" for the Xbox 360.\n\nRIR, headed by former Los Angeles Rams player Les Richter sold the property to real estate developer Fritz Duda in 1983. The irony is that Duda had once been a turn announcer for NASCAR's broadcasting arm Motor Racing Network, and many felt racing would long be a part of the Riverside landscape. \n1988 was the final year of racing for Riverside International Raceway. On June 12, 1988, NASCAR held its final race at RIR – a race won by Rusty Wallace (a caution flag was out for Ruben Garcia when he came off Turn 9 and lost control of his car and hit a wall, missing the grandstands). In 1989, the track was modified from turn 7A to the back straight. \nThe modified track was called Riverside Regional Raceway and continued to be used for club events. After SCORE International held its last race, the track finally closed its gates after 32 years of racing. \n\nFritz Duda turned the \"House that Dan Gurney built\" into a shopping mall which opened in 1992. The Moreno Valley Mall at Towngate is on the northern end of the former raceway property and homes now occupy the southern end of what was the old racetrack (where Tim Richmond and Dale Earnhardt raced). In a 1994 topographical map, the remains of Riverside's Turn 9 and a wall were still visible. However, today nothing is left of RIR except for memorabilia from the racetrack. The old Administration Building remained until 2005, when it was torn down to make way for a complex of town homes.\nNumerous streets in the neighborhood to the east of the Moreno Mall are named after racing identities, such as Yarborough Drive, Gurney Place, Donohue Court, Surtees Court, Brabham Street, Andretti Street and Penske Street.\n\nWhen Riverside closed in 1989, it followed in the footsteps of Ontario Motor Speedway (in nearby Ontario), which closed in 1980, and followed by Ascot Park in Gardena in 1991. In the 1990s, two new circuits opened: Auto Club Speedway in nearby Fontana in 1997, and Toyota Speedway at Irwindale (now the Irwindale Event Center) in 1999 and is in danger of meeting the same fate as Riverside. Both tracks, like Riverside, have been used for filming.\n\nIn 2003, the remainder of the old Riverside International Raceway was torn up. The sign that was at California 60 and Day Street was removed to make way for a Lowe's warehouse and Turn 9 of the old track is now home to houses.\n\nIn 2003, plans were announced to build a road course with a similar design to the famed Riverside layout in Merced, California. The track would have been known as the Riverside Motorsports Park, but the project was abandoned in 2009.\n\nSports Car Club of America (SCCA) Regional & National amateur races, and professional (Trans-Am, Can-Am Series) car races\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3172826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3172826", "title": "South African rebel tours", "text": "South African rebel tours\n\nThe South African rebel tours were a series of seven cricket tours staged between 1982 and 1990. They were known as the rebel tours because the international cricketing bodies banned South Africa throughout this period because of apartheid. As such the tours were organised and conducted in spite of the express disapproval of national cricket boards and governments, the International Cricket Conference and international organisations such as the United Nations. The tours were the subject of enormous contemporaneous controversy and remain a sensitive topic throughout the cricket-playing world.\n\nUntil the D'Oliveira affair in 1968 and Olympic exclusion in 1964, only white athletes had been allowed to represent South Africa in international sport. This position reflected the apartheid society in South Africa (1948 onwards) and racist social conventions pre-dating apartheid. In 1971 an international sports boycott was instituted against South Africa to voice global disapproval of their racist selection policies and apartheid in general. South Africa became world sport's pariah, excluded from the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup, Test cricket and a host of minority sports.\n\nThe boycott effected measurable change on policy and opinion in sports selection – and cricket in particular. In 1976 the South African Cricket Union (SACU) was created to administer the game in the republic on a multi-racial, meritocratic basis: so-called \"normal\" cricket. However this was insufficient to ensure South Africa's re-admission to international cricket. Inside the republic, many non-whites resented \"normal\" cricket, which was a feeble concession in the wider context of life under apartheid, and declined to take part. Outside the Republic, the ICC bloc of India, Pakistan and the West Indies refused to countenance re-admission until apartheid itself was dismantled.\n\nAfter a decade's isolation, cricket in the Republic was weak. Standards, attendances and child participation were all falling. Overseas the game had been revolutionised by the World Cup and World Series Cricket but isolation had deprived South Africa of these commercial and competitive engines. Then in 1979 Doug Insole, an English representative on the ICC, told SACU's Ali Bacher: \"Until apartheid goes, you can forget about getting back into world cricket.\"\n\nBacher and SACU felt obliged to act to \"keep the game alive in South Africa\". Since players were endangering their careers by breaking the boycott, SACU had to offer substantial sums to entice their targets. These rebels would play \"unofficial\" internationals against a Springbok team who considered themselves as strong as any team in world cricket except the West Indies. In the earliest rebel tours, Mike Procter and Peter Kirsten captained home teams featuring Barry Richards, Graeme Pollock, Clive Rice and Garth Le Roux. By their conclusion in 1990 many had retired and were replaced by the likes of Hansie Cronje and Allan Donald.\n\nThe boycott movement opposed any such tours. They felt that engagement lent credibility and a propaganda coup to the National Party. But SACU insisted that all funding came directly from commercial sponsorship and that the tours would be conducted independently of government. Initially, at least, overseas opponents could not prove otherwise while inside South Africa, non-white opposition, as under apartheid more generally, was barely heard due to restrictions on freedoms of press, speech and assembly.\n\nThe first major tour was by an English team led by Graham Gooch in March 1982. Twelve cricketers, 11 of them with Test caps, had agreed in secret to make a one-month tour of the republic. The news only broke when they arrived in Johannesburg. The players expected a brief public outcry and ICC slap on the wrist. Instead they were the subject of global outrage among press and politicians, and labelled \"the Dirty Dozen\" in the Houses of Parliament.\n\nThe reaction in South Africa could not have been more different. The government and white newspapers hailed the return of official international cricket. Apart from Ian Botham, it was said, this was the full-strength England team. Springbok colours were awarded to the home side in a series of three \"Tests\". There were also three \"one-day internationals\".\n\nThe on-field action \"made a mockery of the immense off-field publicity\". The so-called South African Breweries XI were under-prepared and, with the exception of Gooch and Emburey, either past their best or fairly marginal members of the England side (in fact, Taylor and later call-ups Humpage and Sidebottom had not played a Test for England at the time, and Humpage never did play a Test at all.) They were beaten by a South Africa team for whom the uncapped Jimmy Cook and Vintcent van der Bijl starred. The Springboks, captained by Mike Procter, won the \"Test\" series 1-0 and \"ODI\" series 3-0.\n\nThe rebels, who numbered 15 after hiring three further players to cover injuries, all received three-year bans from international cricket. These suspensions ended the careers of more than half the squad including Geoffrey Boycott, the world's leading Test run-scorer at that time. Lever (1), Sidebottom (1), Taylor (2), Willey (6) and Larkins (7) each played a few more Tests, but only Gooch and Emburey had extensive Test careers afterwards (and indeed, both were later to captain England - Emburey for two tests in 1988 against the West Indies, having been a fixture in the side since his return in 1985: Gooch for the final test of that series, then later as the regular captain from the 1989-90 tour of the West Indies to the 1993 Ashes series, remaining as a player for two further years after that). Emburey, in fact, went on England's second rebel tour in 1989, served another three-year ban for it, and was selected again for some matches between 1992 and 1995, though no longer as a regular fixture in the side.\n\n\nSri Lanka was a fledgling Test nation in 1982, playing their inaugural match against England at Colombo in February of that year. Bandula Warnapura’s side were beaten by seven wickets against an experienced visiting team and would fail to win four further Tests as the year progressed.\n\nThen in October it was announced that Warnapura was leading a 14-man rebel squad to South Africa. The team would be called Arosa Sri Lanka after the initials of their player manager Anthony Ralph Opatha and the host nation. The players were vehemently denounced across India, Pakistan and the Caribbean as well as in their homeland.\n\nFor the second successive tour, white South Africa was forced to put on a brave front in acclaiming sporting triumph where there was none. A full-strength Sri Lankan team was some way off international competitiveness so it was little surprise that a makeshift rebel outfit was utterly humiliated, failing to win a single tour match. Now captained by Peter Kirsten of Western Province, South Africa comfortably won all four ‘ODIs’ and both ‘Tests’. Lawrence Seeff, who replaced the injured Barry Richards, and Graeme Pollock made 188 and 197 respectively in the second ‘Test’ but protested that the matches could not be classed as international cricket. SACU, trying to protect the ‘unofficial international’ brand it had created, fined them for the admission.\n\nLife became very difficult for the Sri Lankans who were ostracized at home for a decision many called treasonous. All players received a lifetime ban from the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka. None played international cricket for the island again, although Aponso represented the Netherlands in the 1996 World Cup at the age of 43.\n\n\nThe West Indian players were mainly talented understudies struggling to break into the great West Indian Test team of the period, or men past their prime as Test players. First-class cricketers in the West Indies were then poorly paid and the participants, many of whom had irregular or no employment in the off-season, received between US$100,000 and $120,000 for the two tours. West Indies cricket was so strong that Clive Lloyd had little need for the likes of Lawrence Rowe, Collis King and Sylvester Clarke. Rowe has since stated that he and several other players were disillusioned with the West Indies Cricket board for not selecting them despite good performances \n\nThe strength of Caribbean cricket was evidenced in the ‘international’ matches, where South Africa received their first real test. A fiercely contested four-week series in 1982-3 took ‘unofficial internationals’ to new heights, the Springboks winning the one-day series 4-2 while the ‘Test’ series was drawn 1-1. The dominant theme of the match-ups was West Indian fast bowling. Colin Croft was one of four World Cup winners in the party. Their pace battery, featuring Clarke, Croft, Bernard Julien and Ezra Moseley, terrified Springbok batsmen who were forced to wear helmets for the first time.\n\nThe frantic first series, again organised in secret and conducted on the hoof, set up a fierce battle when the West Indians returned for a full tour the following season. Clarke was by now the dominant player on either side, claiming four five-wicket hauls in the 2-1 ‘Test’ series win. The West Indian XI also won the one-day series 4-2, helped slightly by the Springboks weakening: Barry Richards and Vince van der Bijl retired in 1983, and Mike Procter, 36, played only a single ‘one-day’ international over both tours. Henry Fotheringham, Ken McEwan, Rupert Hanley, Dave Richardson and Mandy Yachad made their debuts for South Africa. Clive Rice was handed the captaincy for the 3rd and 4th \"Tests\" after the sacking of Peter Kirsten for the ‘ODI’ series defeat. Kirsten maintained his place in the team and top scored in the next match. Graham Gooch played against the West Indies team during both tours as a member of a South African provincial side.\n\nThe improvement in the on-field action was in strict contrast to the off-field environment. South Africa stood permanently on the brink of civil war as PW Botha’s brutal government repressed the black majority and excluded them from a new ‘multi-racial’ parliament. This oppression was met with violent reprisals while the rebels were controversial figures in the townships that had worshipped West Indian cricketers only to see them collaborating with the apartheid enemy.\n\nThe participants received a life ban from Caribbean cricket in 1983. In many instances, they were ostracised socially and professionally, such was the hostility toward players that complied with the South African apartheid system. In contrast, the players commented on a warm reception from both blacks and whites in South Africa and the tour may have been a positive influence on relations between races. It was one of the few occasions when white and black people had played sport together in South Africa. The players' bans were lifted in 1989 (although Lynch appeared in ODI's for England a year earlier against the touring West Indians) but the only tour member who played for West Indies again was Moseley, at the age of 32 (two tests in the 1989-90 home series against England: though he did not take many wickets, his appearance was chiefly notable for breaking Graham Gooch's hand, forcing Gooch - now England's captain - to miss the remainder of the series). Stephenson and Clarke had very successful first-class careers in South African and English domestic cricket: and Stephenson in particular could perhaps be thought unlucky not to be given a chance in Test cricket, given the precedent set by Moseley's selection and the fact that his performances in the English county championship had been nothing short of spectacular.\n\nA fierce battle raged – and continues to rage – over the wisdom of the West Indian tours. Were the rebels, as they themselves insisted, showing white South Africa that black men were their equals as the republic stumbled towards democracy? Or, as their detractors still maintain, had they sold themselves and their dignity to extend the life of a disgraced and barbarous government?\n\n\nThe tours by the Australians were led by former Test captain Kim Hughes, with South Africa winning both \"Test\" series 1–0. The squad included several players who represented Australia at Test level, such as fast bowlers Terry Alderman, Rodney Hogg and Carl Rackemann, spinners Trevor Hohns and Tom Hogan opening batsman John Dyson and Steve Smith, weakening the official Australian Test side by depriving it of several of its best players. The tour prompted Australian prime minister Bob Hawke to call the group \"traitors\" and in retrospect has been called \"one of the most painful and traumatic moments in Australian cricket history.\"\n\nHughes accused the Australian Cricket Board of fostering dissatisfaction among the players, making recruitment for the rebel tours easy. Hughes did return to Sheffield Shield cricket in 1988 but never played international cricket again and later returned to South Africa to play for Natal. However, Alderman, Hohns and Rackemann returned to represent Australia in later series, starting in 1989 (Alderman becoming a regular fixture in the side, Hohns and Rackemann as bit-part players). Wessels - a South African by birth, who had been playing for Australia only because of the international ban on South African sport - returned to his native country, playing and captaining for South Africa on their readmission to Test cricket, and later became the first (and so far only) person to score official Test centuries for two nations.\n\nOn the first Australian tour, 1985–86, fast bowlers Hugh Page and Corrie van Zyl made their debuts for South Africa. During the second tour in 1986–87, batsman Brian Whitfield and spinner Omar Henry who became the second non-white player to represent South Africa, and two future stars, all-rounder Brian McMillan and fast bowler Allan Donald made their South African debuts. Kepler Wessels played for the Australian team on their second tour.\n\nSouth Africa won both ‘Test’ series 1-0, both ‘ODI’ series and a ‘day-night’ series. Yet the on-field action could never escape the shadow of apartheid. Newspaper revelations in January 1986 revealed what non-white leaders in South Africa and anti-apartheid campaigners worldwide had been claiming for years: the tours were not funded by business, as Ali Bacher and SACU had always insisted, but by the apartheid government through enormous tax breaks.\n\n\nIn 1990, the final tour was led by former England captain Mike Gatting. The team included former and contemporary England players such as batsmen Tim Robinson, Bill Athey and Chris Broad, wicketkeeper Bruce French, and the fast bowlers Paul Jarvis, Graham Dilley and Neil Foster.\n\nKepler Wessels returned to represent the land of his birth. Roy Pienaar, Dave Rundle and Richard Snell made their debuts for South Africa. Jimmy Cook was appointed as South African captain and Allan Donald took 8 wickets for 59 in the match. South Africa went on to win the only 'Test'. England lost the limited overs series 3–1.\nMost of the squad did not play for England again. Gatting served a three-year ban from Test cricket before his recall to the England side for the tour of India and Sri Lanka in 1992–93, along with John Emburey and Paul Jarvis. Emburey made both rebel tours and served two suspensions. Foster subsequently played a solitary Test, against Australia at Lord's in 1993, as did Alan Wells (against the West Indies in 1995). Matthew Maynard played three more tests, two in the 1993 Ashes and one in the following tour of the West Indies.\n\nThe squad for the rebel tour was announced during the fourth Test of the 1989 Ashes series in England. Players in the squad were not considered for the rest of the series, which allowed future long-term England players, batsman Michael Atherton and fast bowler Devon Malcolm, an opportunity to make their England debuts.\n\nThe tour was a financial disaster as it coincided with the \"unbanning\" of the African National Congress and the release from prison of Nelson Mandela. As South Africa began the dismantling of apartheid, Ali Bacher was surprised at the scale of the mass demonstrations against the tour as previous rebel tours had passed smoothly in the country. The second tour scheduled for 1990-91 was cancelled.\n\n\nThirty-one players were selected to play for South Africa in the 19 Rebel \"Tests\". Vintcent van der Bijl, Rupert Hanley, Denys Hobson, Kevin McKenzie, Alan Kourie, Brian Whitfield, Kenny Watson, Roy Pienaar, Hugh Page, Ray Jennings, Henry Fotheringham, Lawrence Seeff, Stephen Jefferies, Ken McEwan and Garth Le Roux all retired or were beyond their prime before official international cricket resumed for South Africa. Before isolation, Graeme Pollock (23 Tests), Mike Procter (7 Tests) and Barry Richards (4 Tests) had played official Test cricket.\n\nSouth Africa resumed official international cricket in 1991 with a short tour of India, and participation in the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Clive Rice (3), Corrie van Zyl (2), Dave Rundle (2) and Mandy Yachad (1), only played in official ODIs for South Africa. Being in the twilight of their careers, Jimmy Cook played 3 Tests and 6 ODIs, Peter Kirsten 12 Tests and 40 ODIs, Adrian Kuiper 1 Test and 25 ODIs and Omar Henry 3 Tests and 3 ODIs. Allan Donald, 72 Tests and 164 ODIs, Brian McMillan 38 Tests and 78 ODIs and Dave Richardson 42 Tests and 122 ODIs, became the backbone of the new Protea outfit, and to a lesser extent, Richard Snell who played in 5 Tests and 42 ODIs. Kepler Wessels became captain of the team and played in 16 Tests and 55 ODIs for South Africa. During the years of isolation, Wessels played for Australia in 24 Tests and 54 ODIs.\n\nAll of the matches played during the rebel tours were granted first-class status, which was subsequently withdrawn by the International Cricket Council in 1993. , the ICC is reviewing the status of all matches played in South Africa between 1961 and 1991, including those played during the rebel tours, with a view to restoring first-class status to some matches.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ball tampering regulations allow the application of sweat and saliva (naturally produced substances) to the cricket ball in an attempt to shine one side. Other means of altering the ball's condition, such as applying Vaseline, were banned.\n\nLever, and his bowling partner Bob Willis, both found themselves suffering from sweat falling into their eyes. It was suggested, naively, by the team physiotherapist that they apply strips of gauze covered with Vaseline above their eyes to divert sweat from their forehead away. In play these were found to slip, and Willis removed his. Eventually Lever also removed his and lay the gauze on the ground near the stumps where it was noticed by the umpires and Indian team, but not before he had used sweat from his forehead to shine the ball. \n\nBishen Singh Bedi, the under pressure captain of the Indian cricket team, was not convinced the Vaseline was to keep sweat out of the eyes. He said Lever had used unfair means to shine the ball. The English paceman’s habit of rubbing the ball over his eyebrows every now and then was also noticed. Tests on the cricket ball revealed presence of greasy substance. Whether the Vaseline had been intentionally applied to the ball or not was later disputed, and Lever's previous performances on the tour questioned.\n\nhttp://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/447502.html (accessed 15/04/10)\n"}
{"id": "20620344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20620344", "title": "Wireball", "text": "Wireball\n\nWireball is a street game related to baseball, usually formed as a pick-up game, in urban areas of the United States. The equipment consists of a pimple or pensie pinkie ball and a convenient place in a street or driveway where an electric power line or group of power lines bisect horizontally. The rules come from baseball and are modified to fit the situation. It can be played with one or more persons per team.\n\nOpponents stand facing each other on opposite sides of the wire. Limits of play are defined by agreement, usually the width of the street and landmark in the street such as a manhole cover as the furthest limit of the field. The object of the game is for the “batter” to throw the ball over or hit the wire to get a hit. The fielder must catch the ball before it bounces to make an out. Hits are scored accordingly- a ball thrown successfully over the wire and uncaught is a single. A ball that touches the wire and continues over it is a double. A ball that hits the wire squarely and drops straight down is a home run. If the fielder touches but does not catch a home run ball, it is a triple. If the batter throws the ball under the wire it is a strike. As in baseball, foul balls count as strikes for the first two, but you cannot foul-out. The rules vary from neighborhood to neighborhood.\n\nThe ball is thrown hard and high above the wires. The closer the batter can get to a vertical trajectory the better. It is not unusual for the batter to stand almost directly below the wire.\nThe game is more fun and easier if a group of wires is used (two or three).\n\n\n"}
