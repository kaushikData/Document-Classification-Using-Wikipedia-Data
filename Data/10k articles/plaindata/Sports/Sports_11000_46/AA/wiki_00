Details have survived of five important eleven-a-side and three single wicket matches. The popularity of single wicket may have waned as there is a greater proportion of eleven-a-side games in the season's surviving reports.\n\nThe following matches are classified as important:\n\n\"Monday, 10 July\". Five of England defeated Five of Addington at the Artillery Ground. The match was played for fifty guineas a side and was the result of a challenge by the Addington players to meet any other five in England. Betting was 8-1 in favour of Addington.\n\nAddington: Tom Faulkner, Joe Harris, John Harris, George Jackson, Durling.\n\nEngland: Robert Colchin, John Bryant, Robert Eures, John Bell, Thomas Waymark.\n\n\"Monday, 17 July\". In a return match, the same Addington five beat the same England five for fifty guineas.\n\n\"Wednesday, 26 July\". In a deciding match, England won by 2 runs. They scored 11 and 12; Addington replied with 16 and 5. The prize this time was 100 guineas. England made two changes to their team with James Bryant and Val Romney replacing John Bell and Thomas Waymark. Addington's five were unchanged.\n\n\"Friday, 18 August\". Tom Faulkner's Six defeated Long Robin's Six at the Artillery Ground. Played for fifty guineas a side. Faulkner's Six: Tom Faulkner, Thomas Southam, Joseph Hitches, George Carter and \"two gentlemen\". Colchin's Six: Robert Colchin, George Smith, William Anderson, Robinson and \"two gentlemen\".\n\n\"Monday, 21 August\". Tom Faulkner's Six defeated Long Robin's Six at the Artillery Ground. The teams were the same as for the match above; the stake was unrecorded.\n\nA match in Sussex on Monday, 5 June between teams from Hastings and Pevensey was apparently played for a hundred guineas.\n\nA game at White Conduit Fields on Wednesday, 2 August involving 22 \"gentlemen of the City of London\". The report states that the venue was in use before 1720 but that the White Conduit Club was not established until c.1780. On the site was the White Conduit Tavern, erected in about 1648, and this was a \"favourite halting-place for those who had walked out a short distance from London\". In 1749, the Tavern was owned by William Curnock and shortly afterwards by Robert Bartholomew, the Surrey cricketer.\n\n\"Tuesday, 29 August\". Portsmouth versus Fareham & Titchfield on Portsmouth Common. The Portsmouth team, which was described as \"those living on the Common\", won by great odds.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38571427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38571427", "title": "Callister Park", "text": "Callister Park\n\nCon Jones Park was a sports facility located in East Vancouver that was mainly used for soccer. It opened in 1921, and was renamed Callister Park in 1942. After the demolition of the stadium in 1971, the area was redeveloped into a green space and retained the name Callister Park.\n\nIn April 1885 builder and contractor John Callister arrived in Vancouver from the Isle of Man. Callister was a pioneer who built his home in a forested area covering about three blocks in 1904. Upon his death Callister, a bachelor, left his property to two nieces. One of the sisters died, and Mrs. Ada M. Stevenson inherited all of the property.\n\nOn September 18, 1920, sports promoter Con Jones entered into an agreement to purchase \"lot 5, Town of Hastings, Suburban Lands\" for $10,000 from Stevenson. According to the Vancouver city archives only three payments of $1,000 were made. In the space of a year, Jones supervised the building of a grandstand and field and Con Jones Park opened in 1921.\n\nThe park was destroyed by fire in June, 1934. Jones' sons rebuilt the stadium within weeks.\n\nMedia reports stated that due to Jones' default on payment, Stevenson seized the property and offered to present the land to the city. While many focus on the lack of mortgage payments, it appears to be several years of unpaid city taxes that forced the issue. Both of Jones' sons had died, which brought this to light. The land reverted to the Callister estate, and Stevenson donated it to the city in lieu of paying the taxes on it.\n\nOn March 20, 1942, Mrs. Stevenson entered into an agreement with the city to present the area for \"municipal purposes\". The bequest further stated that this expression...\"be deemed to include exhibition, recreation or park purposes and the carrying on of public sports.\"\n\nWith the opening of Empire Stadium in 1954, many of the touring soccer teams from the United Kingdom shifted their friendlies to the much larger and more modern facility which was only a five minute walk away on the opposite side of the PNE grounds.\n\nFrom the time the PNE took possession of Callister Park - until the opening of Empire Stadium in 1954 - with soccer as its principal tenant Callister Park made money. The annual friendlies featuring touring British soccer teams playing against local all-star squads were the most profitable.\n\nIn 1921 Third Lanark played two games in Vancouver; one at Con Jones Park and the other at Brockton Oval at Stanley Park.\n\nNewcastle United visited on June 4, 1949 and played the BC All-Stars in front of an overflow crowd of 9,800. The game was played a week after a rodeo was staged on the grounds, prompting Newcastle manager George Martin to describe Callister as, \"...a disgrace to football\". Rangers were the final big name team to play at Callister in 1954.\n\nThe Vancouver Maple Leafs brought professional baseball back to the city for the first time in 15 years in a 5-4 loss to the Tacoma Tigers before 1,500 fans in April 1937. The Western International League would leave Con Jones Park at the end of the 1938 season as Jones sold the team to Seattle beer baron Emil Sick. Sick renamed the team the Vancouver Capilanos (after his brewery) and moved the team crosstown to Athletic Park for the 1939 season.\n\nThere were sports other than soccer played at the facility. Field Lacrosse was popular in the Intercity Lacrosse League during the 1920s and 1930s. Rodeos, demolition derby and rugby union were also staged there from time-to-time, although in the case of rugby, Brockton Oval, Vancouver's Athletic Park and UBC's Varsity Stadium (Vancouver) were the standard facilities for the game.\n\n"}

The academy is one of twelve \"élite\" academies located in and around France that are supervised by the French Football Federation (FFF). Only the best players from the Île-de-France \"région\" train at the Clairefontaine academy. The twelve other academies are situated in Castelmaurou, Châteauroux, Liévin, Dijon, Marseille, Ploufragan, Vichy and Reims, Réunion, Saint-Sébastien-sur-Loire, Guadeloupe and Talence.\n\nClairefontaine opened in 1988 and is named after Fernand Sastre, the president of the FFF from 1972–1984. The academy is located 50 km southwest of Paris at Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines and is one of the best known football academies in the world. It has a high reputation of producing some of the most gifted French and non-French players including Nicolas Anelka, Louis Saha, William Gallas, Hatem Ben Arfa, Abou Diaby, Sébastien Bassong, Mehdi Benatia, Blaise Matuidi, Kylian Mbappé, Olivier Giroud and national team top scorer Thierry Henry. The academy is also used to house the national football teams of France and the centre drew media spotlight following its usage as a base camp by the France team that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\n\nPrior to the establishment of Clairefontaine, France didn't acquire much successes at international football, and even at big tournaments, France had never won any official trophies in comparison to its neighbors Italy and Germany. In the 1960s, Spain and England also acquired successes, forcing France to establish a football centre to catch up. In 1976, French Football Federation president and longtime official Fernand Sastre desired for the creation of a national centre of football. The project was initiated by Ștefan Kovács, who was inspired by the former Romanian communist training centres.\n\nSix years later, especially following France's victory at the UEFA Euro 1984, the FFF selected Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines as the site of the centre. Construction of the centre commenced in 1985 and lasted nearly three years. The centre opened its doors in January 1988. During the 1998 World Cup, which France hosted, Clairefontaine housed the French national team. That same year, the FFF named the centre in Fernand Sastre's honor. A bust of Sastre was put on the grounds in 2000; also present on the grounds is a statue of the FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe best young football players from the Île-de-France region (of which Paris is the capital) stay at Clairefontaine from 13 to 15 for training and development of their technical skills. Most of the players that attend here are often being tracked by established French clubs and go on to have very successful careers. Today, many top local clubs play at the grounds.\n\nIn order for a player to be selected to the Clairefontaine academy, he/she must be at least 13 years of age, have French citizenship, and be living and playing within the Île-de-France region, though players living in the departments of Seine-Maritime and Eure can also apply and be selected. Registration for new players at the academy normally begins in October the year before players enroll at the academy when prospective applicants are 12 years of age. Players have until December to register with their club for acceptance into the academy. The first set of trials are carried out by each district within Île-de-France. Each district selects a set number of players who will travel to Clairefontaine to attend a tryout, which is usually held over a three-day period during the Easter school holidays. After the three days, the academy director and officials will convene to select a maximum of 22 players with three or four of the 22 being goalkeepers.\n\nPlayers who are selected to attend Clairefontaine stay and train at the facilities from Monday through to Friday. Players are given the weekend off to visit family and train and play with their parent clubs. They are also given school holidays off. Players are also required to meet educational criteria. Players age 13–15 training at Clairefontaine attend the Collège Catherine de Vivonne de Rambouilet in Rambouillet. After departing Rambouilet, players enroll at the nearby high school Lycée Louis Bascan de Rambouillet with hopes that they will earn their Baccalauréat. All costs required to attend an academy are borne by the federation and the Ligue Nationale de Football.\n\nYouth development at Clairefontaine incorporates many principles on football with their students, such as:\n\nBecause of its popularity, a great number of players, many have become represented in international football, has existed. This is a short list of these players who represented at international stage for France and other national teams:\n\nClairefontaine is an immense football centre, encompassing 56 hectares of land and containing 66,000 square metres of turfed grounds. It is located in the valley of Chevreuse in the heart of the Rambouillet forest. Clairefontaine has several training grounds, a stadium pitch and even an indoor pitch made of artificial turf. The centre also includes a medical building, gym, fitness room, restaurant and cafeteria. There are even three tennis courts on the grounds.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35210080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35210080", "title": "Malay grammar", "text": "Malay grammar\n\nMalay grammar is the body of rules that describe the structure of expressions in the Malay language (known as Indonesian in Indonesia and Malaysian/Malay in Malaysia). This includes the structure of words, phrases, clauses and sentences.\n\nIn Malay, there are four basic parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and grammatical function words (particles). Nouns and verbs may be basic roots, but frequently they are derived from other words by means of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nMalay is an agglutinative language, and new words are formed by three methods. New words can be created by attaching affixes onto a root word (affixation), formation of a compound word (composition), or repetition of words or portions of words (reduplication).\n\nRoot words are either nouns or verbs, which can be affixed to derive new words, e.g. \"masak\" (to cook) yields \"memasak\" (cooks), \"memasakkan\" (cooks for), \"dimasak\" (cooked) as well as \"pemasak\" (a cook), \"masakan\" (a meal, cookery). Many initial consonants undergo mutation when prefixes are added: e.g. \"sapu\" (sweep) becomes \"penyapu\" (broom); \"panggil\" (to call) becomes \"memanggil\" (calls/calling), \"tapis\" (to sieve) becomes \"menapis\" (sieves).\n\nOther examples of the use of affixes to change the meaning of a word can be seen with the word \"ajar\" (teach):\n\nThere are four types of affixes, namely prefixes (\"awalan\"), suffixes (\"akhiran\"), circumfixes (\"apitan\") and infixes (\"sisipan\"). These affixes are categorised into noun affixes, verb affixes, and adjective affixes.\n\nNoun affixes are affixes that form nouns upon addition to root words. The following are examples of noun affixes:\n\nThe prefix \"per-\" drops its \"r\" before \"r, l\" and frequently before \"p, t, k.\" In some words it is \"peng-\"; though formally distinct, these are treated as variants of the same prefix in Malay grammar books.\n\nSimilarly, verb affixes are attached to root words to form verbs. In Malay, there are:\n\nAdjective affixes are attached to root words to form adjectives:\n\nIn addition to these affixes, Malay also has a lot of borrowed affixes from other languages such as Sanskrit, Arabic and English. For example, \"maha-\", \"pasca-\", \"eka-\", \"bi-\", \"anti-\", \"pro-\" etc.\n\nIn Malay, new words can be formed by joining two or more root words. Compound words, when they exist freely in a sentence, are often written separately. Compound words are only attached to each other when they are bound by circumfix or when they are already considered as stable words.\n\nFor example, the word \"kəreta\" which means \"car\" and \"api\" which means \"fire\", are compounded to form a new word \"kəreta api\" (train). Similarly, \"ambil alih\" (take over) is formed using the root words \"ambil\" (take) and \"alih\" (move), but will link together when a circumfix is attached to it, i.e. \"pengambilalihan\" (takeover). Certain stable words, such as \"kakitangan\" (personnel), and \"kerjasama\" (cooperation), are spelled as one word even when they exist freely in sentences.\n\nReduplication (\"Kata Ganda\" or \"Kata Ulang\") in the Malay language is a very productive process. It is mainly used for forming plurals, but sometimes it may alter the meaning of the whole word, or change the usage of the word in sentences.\n\nThere are four types of words reduplication in Malay, namely\n\nFull reduplication is the complete duplication of the word, separated by a dash (-). For example, \"buku\" (book) when duplicated form \"buku-buku\" (books), while the duplicated form of \"batu\" (stone) is \"batu-batu\" (stones).\n\nPartial reduplication repeats only the initial consonant of the word, such as \"dedaun\" (leaves) from the word \"daun\" (leaf), and \"tetangga\" (neighbor) from the word \"tangga\" (ladder). The words are usually not separated by spaces or punctuation, and is considered a single word.\n\nRhythmic reduplication repeats the whole word, but one or more of the its phonemes are altered. For example, the word \"gerak\" (motion) can be reduplicated rhythmically to form \"gerak-gerik\" (movements) by altering the vowel. The reduplication can also be formed by altering the consonant, e.g. in \"sayur-mayur\" (vegetables [bundled for the market]) from the root word \"sayur\" (vegetable/vegetables [what is found on plate]).\n\nReduplication is used for expression of various grammatical functions (such as verbal aspect) and it is part in a number of complex morphological models.\n\nReduplication of nouns and pronouns can express at least three meanings:\n\n\nReduplication of an adjective can express different things:\n\nReduplication of a verb can express various things:\n\nSimple reduplication:\n\nReduplication with \"meN-\" prefixation, depending on the position of the prefix \"meN-\":\nNotice that in the first case, the nasalisation of the initial consonant (whereby /p/ becomes /m/) is repeated, while in the second case, it only applies in the repeated word.\n\nCommon derivational affixes for nouns are \"peng-/per-/juru-\" (actor, instrument, or someone characterized by the root), \"-an\" (collectivity, similarity, object, place, instrument), \"ke-...-an\" (abstractions and qualities, collectivities), \"per-/peng-...-an\" (abstraction, place, goal or result).\n\nMalay does not make use of grammatical gender. There are only a few words that use natural gender; the same word used for \"he\" and \"she\" is also used for \"his\" and \"her\". Most of the words that refer to people (family terms, professions, etc.) have a form that does not distinguish between the sexes. For example, \"adik\" can both refer to a younger sibling of either sex. In order to specify the natural gender of a noun, an adjective has to be added: \"adik lelaki\" corresponds to \"brother\" but really means \"male younger sibling\". There are some words that are gendered. For instance, \"puteri\" means \"princess\" and \"putera\" means \"prince\"; words like these are usually borrowed from other languages (in this case, Sanskrit).\n\nThere is no grammatical plural in Malay. Thus \"orang\" may mean either \"person\" or \"people\". Plurality is expressed by the context, or the usage of words such as numerals, \"beberapa\" \"some\", or \"semua\" \"all\" that express plurality. In many cases, it simply isn't relevant to the speaker.\n\nReduplication is commonly used to emphasize plurality. However, reduplication has many other functions. For example, \"orang-orang\" means \"(all the) people\", but \"orang-orangan\" means \"scarecrow\". Similarly, while \"hati\" means \"heart\" or \"liver\", \"hati-hati\" is a verb meaning \"to be careful\". Also, not all reduplicated words are inherently plural, such as \"orang-orangan\" \"scarecrow/scarecrows\", \"biri-biri\" \"a/some sheep\" and \"kupu-kupu\" \"butterfly/butterflies\". Some reduplication is rhyming rather than exact, as in \"sayur-mayur\" \"(all sorts of) vegetables\".\n\nDistributive affixes derive mass nouns that are effectively plural: \"pohon\" \"tree\", \"pepohonan\" \"flora, trees\"; \"rumah\" \"house\", \"perumahan\" \"housing, houses\"; \"gunung\" \"mountain\", \"pe(r)gunungan\" \"mountain range, mountains\".\n\nQuantity words come before the noun: \"səribu orang\" \"a thousand people\", \"beberapa pe(r)gunungan\" \"a series of mountain ranges\", \"beberapa kupu-kupu\" \"some butterflies\".\n\nPersonal pronouns are not a separate part of speech, but a subset of nouns. They are frequently omitted, and there are numerous ways to say \"you\". Commonly the person's name, title, title with name, or occupation is used (\"does Johnny want to go?\", \"would Madam like to go?\"); kin terms, including fictive kinship, are extremely common. However, there are also dedicated personal pronouns, as well as the demonstrative pronouns \"ini\" \"this, the\" and \"itu\" \"that, the\".\n\nFrom the perspective of a European language, Malay boasts a wide range of different pronouns, especially to refer to the addressee (the so-called second person pronouns). These are used to differentiate several parameters of the person they are referred to, such as the social rank and the relationship between the addressee and the speaker.\n\nThis table shows an overview over the most commonly and widely used pronouns of the Malay language:\n\nNotable among the personal-pronoun system is a distinction between two forms of \"we\": \"kita\" (you and me, you and us) and \"kami\" (us, but not you). The distinction is increasingly confused in colloquial Indonesian.\n\n\"Saya\" and \"aku\" are the two major forms of \"I\"; \"saya\" (or its literary / archaic form \"sahaya\") is the more formal form, whereas \"aku\" is used with close acquitances like family and friends, and between lovers. \"Sa(ha)ya\" may also be used for \"we\", but in such cases it is usually used with \"sekalian\" or \"semua\" \"all\"; this form is ambiguous as to whether it corresponds with inclusive \"kami\" or exclusive \"kita\". Less common are \"hamba\" \"slave\", \"hamba tuan, hamba datok\" (all extremely humble), \"beta\" (a royal addressing oneselves), \"patik\" (/pateʔ/, a commoner addressing a royal), \"kami\" (royal or editorial \"we\"), \"kita\", \"teman\" (/təman/), and \"kawan\" (lit. \"friend\").\n\nThere are three common forms of \"you\", \"anda\" (polite), \"kamu\" (familiar), and \"kalian\" \"all\" (commonly used as a plural form of you, slightly informal). \"Anda\" is used in formal contexts like in advertisements and business or to show respect (though terms like \"tuan\" \"sir\" and other titles also work the same way), while \"kamu\" is used in situations where the speaker would use \"saya\" for \"I\". \"Anda sekalian\" is polite plural. \"Engkau orang\" —contracted to \"kau orang\" or \"korang\"—is used to address subjects plural in the most informal context.\n\n\"Engkau\" (\"əŋkau\", commonly shortened to \"kau\") and \"hang\" (dialectical) are used to social inferiors or equals, \"awak\" to equals, and \"encik\" (/əntʃeʔ/, contracted to \"cik\" before a name) is polite, traditionally used for people without title. The compounds \"'makcik\" and \"pakcik\" are used with village elders one is well acquainted with or the guest of.\n\n\"Tuanku\" (from \"tuan aku\", \"my lord\") is used by commoners to address royal members.\n\nThe common word for \"s/he\" and \"they\" is \"ia\", which has the object and emphatic/focused form \"dia\"; consequently \"ia\" has been recently used to refer to animals. \"Beliau\" (/bəliau/, \"his/her Honour\") is respectful. As with the English \"you\", names and kin terms are extremely common. Colloquially, \"dia orang\" (or its contracted form \"diorang\") is commonly used for the plural \"they\" whereas \"mereka\" \"someone\", \"mereka itu\", or \"orang itu\" \"those people\" are used in writing.\n\n\"Baginda\" - corresponding to \"his/her Majesty/Highness\" - is used for addressing royal figures and religious prophets, especially in Islamic literature.\n\nThere are a large number of other words for \"I\" and \"you\", many regional, dialectical, or borrowed from local languages. \"Saudara\" (masc., \"you\") or \"saudari\" (fem., pl. \"saudara-saudara\" / \"saudari-saudari\" / \"saudara-saudari\") show utmost respect. \"Daku\" (\"I\") and \"dikau\" (\"you\") are poetic or romantic. Indonesian \"gua\" (\"I\") and \"lu\" \"you\" are slang and extremely informal. In the dialect of the northern states of Malaysia - Kedah, Penang, Perlis and Perak (northern) typically \"hang\" is used as \"you\" (singular), while \"hampa\" or \"hangpa\" are used for the plural \"you\". In the state of Pahang, two variants for \"I\" and \"you\" exist, depending on location: in East Pahang, around Pekan, \"kome\" is used as \"I\" while in the west around Temerloh, \"koi\", \"keh\" or \"kah\" is used. \"Kome\" is also used in Kuala Kangsar, Perak, but instead it means \"you\". This allegedly originated from the fact that both the royal families of Pahang and Perak (whose seats are in Pekan and Kuala Kangsar respectively) were descendants of the same ancient line.\n\nThe informal pronouns \"aku, kamu, engkau, ia, kami,\" and \"kita\" are indigenous to Malay.\n\n\"Aku, kamu, engkau\", and \"ia\" have short possessive enclitic forms. All others retain their full forms like other nouns, as does emphatic \"dia\": \"meja saya, meja kita, meja anda, meja dia\" \"my table, our table, your table, his/her table\".\n\nThere are also proclitic forms of \"aku\" and \"engkau\", \"ku-\" and \"kau-\". These are used when there is no emphasis on the pronoun:\n\nHere \"ku-\"verb is used for a general report, \"aku\" verb is used for a factual statement, and emphatic \"aku-lah meng-\"verb (≈ \"I am the one who...\") for focus on the pronoun.\n\nThere are two demonstrative pronouns in Malay. \"Ini\" \"this, these\" is used for a noun which is generally near to the speaker. \"Itu\" \"that, those\" is used for a noun which is generally far from the speaker. Either may sometimes be equivalent to English \"the\". There is no difference between singular and plural. However, plural can be indicated through duplication of a noun followed by a \"ini\" or \"itu\". The word \"yang\" \"which\" is often placed before demonstrative pronouns to give emphasis and a sense of certainty, particularly when making references or enquiries about something/someone, like English \"this one\" or \"that one\".\n\nAnother distinguishing feature of Malay is its use of measure words, also called classifiers (\"penjodoh bilangan\"). In this way, it is similar to many other languages of Asia, including Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, Burmese, and Bengali.\n\nMeasure words are found in English \"two head of cattle\", \"a loaf of bread\", or \"this sheet of paper\", where \"*two cattle, a bread,\" and \"this paper\" (in the sense of \"this piece of paper\") would be ungrammatical. The word \"satu\" reduces to \"se-\" , as it does in other compounds:\n\nLess common are\nMeasure words are not necessary just to say \"a\": \"burung\" \"a bird, birds\". Using \"se-\" plus a measure word is closer to English \"one\" or \"a certain\":\n\nVerbs are not inflected for person or number, and they are not marked for tense; tense is instead denoted by time adverbs (such as \"yesterday\") or by other tense indicators, such as \"sudah\" \"already\" and \"belum\" \"not yet\". On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and to denote voice or intentional and accidental moods. Some of these affixes are ignored in colloquial speech.\n\nExamples of these are the prefixes \"di-\" (patient focus, frequently but erroneously called \"passive voice\", for OVA word order), \"meng-\" (agent focus, frequently but erroneously called \"active voice\", for AVO word order), \"memper-\" and \"diper-\" (causative, agent and patient focus), \"ber-\" (stative or habitual; intransitive VS order), and \"ter-\" (agentless actions, such as those which are involuntary, sudden, or accidental, for VA = VO order); the suffixes \"-kan\" (causative or benefactive) and \"-i\" (locative, repetitive, or exhaustive); and the circumfixes \"ber-...-an\" (plural subject, diffuse action) and \"ke-...-an\" (unintentional or potential action or state).\n\n\nOften the derivation changes the meaning of the verb rather substantially:\n\nForms in \"ter-\" and \"ke-...-an\" are often equivalent to adjectives in English.\n\nThere are no grammatical adjectives in Malay. Instead, stative verbs are used to describe various animate and inanimate objects, places and abstract concepts.\nFour words are used for negation in Malay, namely \"tidak\", \"bukan\", \"jangan\", and \"belum\".\n\nFor example:\n\n\nThere are 16 types of function words in Malay which perform a grammatical function in a sentence. Amongst these are conjunctions, interjections, prepositions, negations and determiners.\n\nStative verbs, demonstrative determiners, and possessive determiners follow the noun they modify.\n\nMalay does not have a grammatical subject in the sense that English does. In intransitive clauses, the noun comes before the verb. When there is both an agent and an object, these are separated by the verb (OVA or AVO), with the difference encoded in the voice of the verb. OVA, commonly but inaccurately called \"passive\", is the basic and most common word order.\n\nEither the agent or object or both may be omitted. This is commonly done to accomplish one of two things:\n\n\nFor example, a polite shop assistant in a store may avoid the use of pronouns altogether and ask:\n\n\nFor example, a friend may enquire as to when you bought your property, to which you may respond:\nUltimately, the choice of voice and therefore word order is a choice between actor and patient and depends quite heavily on the language style and context.\n\nWord order is frequently modified for focus or emphasis, with the focused word usually placed at the beginning of the clause and followed by a slight pause (a break in intonation):\n\n\nThe last two are more likely to be encountered in speech than in writing.\n\n"}

Despite the use of the name \"Olympic Stadium\" the facility was neither built as part of a bid to host the Olympic Games, nor has it been used in such games.\n\nIn 2007 the Turkmen government decided to reconstruct the stadium and to enlarge it. The new arena will hold up to 45,000 people. The stadium closed in 2012, and was partially demolished in 2013 for redevelopment. The most prominent feature of the new renovations is the horse head of \"Akhal-Teke\" which resembles the national emblem of the country.\n\nIt was used mostly for football matches, but also for musical performances by Turkmen pop stars such as Maral Ibragimova.\n\nThe renovated stadium was the site of the 5th Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games, which is also counted as the 5th Asian Indoor Games. The opening and closing ceremonies for the games were held in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan on 17th and 27th September 2017.\n\n\n"}

This tactic is also sometimes referred to as a \"see-saw\". \n\nIn the game pictured at right, Carlos Torre-Repetto makes use of the windmill tactic against Emanuel Lasker to win two pawns and a bishop and enter into a winning endgame (although the bishop had to be given back). The move 25. Bf6!, the queen, sets up the windmill. Black must accept the sacrifice, as his own queen is unprotected, and any attempt to stop the windmill would simply give White the queen. Then 25... Qxh5 26. Rxg7+ Kh8 27. Rxf7+ discovered check by the bishop. White simply repeats the regular check/discovered check pattern, taking as many pieces as he can with his rook. 27... Kg8 28. Rg7+ Kh8 29. Rxb7+ Kg8 30. Rg7+ Kh8 31. Rg5+ Kh7 32. Rxh5 White concludes the windmill by taking the black queen.\n\nAnother example is in Bobby Fischer's Game of the Century, from moves 18 to 23. In this case, the windmill involved a knight and a bishop.\n"}
