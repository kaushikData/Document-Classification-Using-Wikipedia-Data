Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included Eden (Auckland), Moturoa (New Plymouth), Petone, Technical Old Boys (Christchurch), Northern (Dunedin), and Invercargill Thistle.\n\nThe final was played in front of a then-record crowd of 12,000. Interest was high as the local Wellingtonian team was a lower ranked team (in the second division of Wellington football) who had gained a reputation as giant-killers. They went on to win the final 1-0 after having beaten several higher ranked sides in the course of the tournament, including a narrow win over Waterside and a heavy 7-1 thrashing of Wellington Marist. The final is memorable for the magic of the giant-killing performance, which caught the imagination of the local population. The only goal of the match came in the second half, when Northern keeper Jim Stephenson parried a David McKissock shot directly into the path of Petone forward Wally Hewitt who duly scored. Petone survived a late scare when keeper Ben Savage was required to save a penalty, and the Settlers of Petone held on to win by the solitary goal.\n\nMatch abandoned after 40 minutes of extra time due to bad light.\n\n"}

The game of snooker originated among British Army officers stationed in India in the latter half of the 19th century. \n\nBilliard champions like Wilson Jones, Michael Ferreira, and Geet Sethi have come out of India. Pankaj Advani is another successful Indian player. Training camps for identifying talent and providing them regional and state sponsorship have been organised by the Billiards and Snooker Federation in various parts of the country. \n\nThe origin of snooker dates back to the latter half of the 19th century. In the 1870s, billiards was a popular activity amongst British Army officers stationed in India and several variations of the game were devised during this time. One such variation originated at the officers' mess of the 11th Devonshire Regiment in 1875, which combined the rules of two pocket billiards games, pyramid and life pool. The former was played with fifteen red balls and one black positioned in a triangle, while the latter involved the potting of designated coloured balls. The game developed its own identity in 1884 when its first set of rules was finalised by Sir Neville Chamberlain, an English officer who helped develop and popularise the game at Stone House in Ooty on a table built by Burroughes & Watts that was brought over by boat. The word \"snooker\" was a slang term for first-year cadets and inexperienced military personnel, but Chamberlain would often use it to describe the inept performance of one of his fellow officers at the table. The name instantly stuck with the players.\n\nThe earliest contemporary reference to cue sports in India appears in a letter written by Captain Sheldrick from Calcutta on 2 February 1886. The letter gives a detailed account of a game called \"Snookers\". The letter also contains references to the game being played among members of the British Indian Army in 1884. British officer Ian Hamilton, who was stationed in Ooty from 1882-84, wrote a letter in 1938 in which he noted, \"I have never doubted that my old friend Sir Neville Chamberlain invented the game of Snooker. I was in at Ootacamund in 1882-84 and there still must be some crowd left who can testify to the belief their current that Snooker owed its birth to Neville Chamberlain fertile brain. Could the game have existed in Ooty even before Chamberlain arrival just waiting for him to discover it and give it a new name. This is a certainly a possibility.\" The Billiards and Snooker Federation of India (BFSI) states that Ooty is \"the most credible birthplace for the game of Snooker\", however, the federation rejects the theory that the game was already established in Ooty. The BSFI also states that, based on available evidence, the first snooker game in India occurred at Ooty \"almost precisely\" in December 1881.\n"}

It was founded in 1997.\n\nKarate was first introduced in Ghana in the second half of the 1990s. Until the late 1990s, karate training in Ghana was more of a traditional martial art than a sport. Karate prospered because of the immense contribution of practitioners and mentors such as Sensei Daniel Djura, founder of Africa Goju; Sensei Donald Djura; Sensei Moses Baiden; Sensei Duke Banson; and Sensei Quagrine.\n\nOn 30 April 1997, a national body was registered and inaugurated with the National Sports Council (NSC) in the name of Ghana Karate-Do Federation (GKF) as the 26th sporting association. The GKF was affiliated to the Union of African Karate Federation (UFAK) and eventually to the World Karate Federation (WKF).\n\nThe founding members were Melvin Brown, Francis Fuster, Benjamin Selormey, Victor Amara, Daniel Gyamfi and Samuel Akpalu. After the inauguration of the federation, there was the need to form an executive and a technical committee. The executive committee was chaired by Rtd. Captain George Mould, and FrancisFuster and Jude Adu-Amankwah were his vice. All the other members were karatekas and served on the technical committee with Benjamin Selormey as Technical Director. \n\nThe Ghana Karate-Do Federation later came to be recognized as Ghana Karate-Do Association. \n\nIn 2004 Jude Adu-Amankwah took over from Capt. Mould as president of the association, with Sensei Melvin Brown as Technical Director, and Sensei Kwabena A. Poku as Referee and vice to the Technical Director. The other members of the technical committee were Sensei Prince Wilson, Sensei George-Slater Commodore, Sensei Saadisu Mamah Idrissu, Sensei Frank Danso Bekoe and Sensei Sylvester Davies. The technical committee is in charge of coaching and general training and grading of karatekas at the national level.\nThe membership of the executive committee was changed in 2009, with Michael Nunoo as the Chairman of the association and Sensei Saadisu Idrissu as the Technical Director. The present composition of the Management Board as of May 2011 is Michael Nunoo, Chairman; Ade Sawyer, Vice-Chairman; Patrick Anyidoho-Cofie, General Secretary; Nathaniel Nartey, member; Sensei Kwabena Poku, Head Coach; Sensei Frank Danso Bekoe, Deputy Coach; and Dr. Sulley, member.

Since then the association has participated in many yearly UFAK Zone 3 Championships and has performed increasingly well, winning laurels in both Kumite and Kata. The Association has also represented Ghana in three All Africa Games since its inauguration: in 1997, 2003 and 2007, when contestant Victor Lartey won by correction of a previous decision.\n\nGhana Karate Do Association is a member of the African umbrella organization Union of African Karate Federation (UAKF) as well as the World Association for World Karate Federation (WKF).\n\nOn the part of the Ghana Olympic Committee, the Ghana Karate Association is the only Karate Association authorized to send athletes to the Olympic Games.\n"}

The pain is often worsened by shoulder overhead movement and may occur at night, especially when lying on the affected shoulder. The onset of the pain may be acute if due to an injury or insidious if due to a gradual process such as an osteoarthritic spur. The pain has been described as dull rather than sharp, and lingers for long periods of a time, making it hard to fall sleep. Other symptoms can include a grinding or popping sensation during movement of the shoulder.\n\nThe range of motion at the shoulder may be limited by pain. A painful arc of movement may be present during forward elevation of the arm from 60° to 120°. Passive movement at the shoulder will appear painful when a downwards force is applied at the acromion but the pain will ease once the downwards force is removed.\n\nWhen the arm is raised, the subacromial space (gap between the anterior edge of the acromion and the head of the humerus) narrows; the supraspinatus muscle tendon passes through this space. Anything that causes further narrowing has the tendency to impinge the tendon and cause an inflammatory response, resulting in impingement syndrome. Such causes can be bony structures such as subacromial spurs (bony projections from the acromion), osteoarthritic spurs on the acromioclavicular joint, and variations in the shape of the acromion. Thickening or calcification of the coracoacromial ligament can also cause impingement. Loss of function of the rotator cuff muscles, due to injury or loss of strength, may cause the humerus to move superiorly, resulting in impingement. Inflammation and subsequent thickening of the subacromial bursa may also cause impingement.\n\nWeight training exercises where the arms are elevated above shoulder height but in an internally rotated position such as the upright row have been suggested as a cause of subacromial impingement. Another common cause of Impingement syndrome is restrictions in the range movement of the scapulo-thoracic surfaces. Commonly, a rib (or ribs) between rib 2 and rib 7/8 on the side of the impingement, may jut out slightly and/or feel hard when the person springs on it/them. When this occurs, the scapula is raised and anteverted (angled forwards). This in turn pushes the acromion and the humeral head out of its usual anatomical position placing pressure downwards at the head of the humerus at the position of the nerve thus causing the impingement syndrome. This is visibly demonstrated by a slightly raised and protracted shoulder girdle. Note: the humerus anteverts in this position causing a more protrusive section of the humerus to press upwards towards the acromion.\n\nThe scapula plays an important role in shoulder impingement syndrome. It is a wide, flat bone lying on the posterior thoracic wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include the muscles of the rotator cuff- the subscapularis, infraspinatus, teres minor and supraspinatus. These muscles attach to the surface of the scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the glenohumeral joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula. Each of these muscles has their own role in shoulder function and must be in balance with each other in order to avoid shoulder pathology. \n\nAbnormal scapular function is called scapular dyskinesis. One action the scapula performs during a throwing or serving motion is elevation of the acromion process in order to avoid impingement of the rotator cuff tendons. If the scapula fails to properly elevate the acromion, impingement may occur during the cocking and acceleration phase of an overhead activity. The two muscles most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the serratus anterior and the lower trapezius. These two muscles act as a force couple within the glenohumeral joint to properly elevate the acromion process, and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder impingement may develop.\n\nImpingement syndrome can usually be diagnosed by history and physical exam. On physical exam, the physician may twist or elevate the patient's arm to test for reproducible pain (the Neer sign and Hawkins-Kennedy test). These tests help localize the pathology to the rotator cuff; however, they are not specific for impingement. Neer sign may also be seen with subacromial bursitis.\n\nThe physician may inject lidocaine (usually combined with a steroid) into the bursa, and if there is an improved range of motion and decrease in pain, this is considered a positive \"Impingement Test\". It not only supports the diagnosis for impingement syndrome, but it is also therapeutic.\n\nPlain x-rays of the shoulder can be used to detect some joint pathology and variations in the bones, including acromioclavicular arthritis, variations in the acromion, and calcification. However, x-rays do not allow visualization of soft tissue and thus hold a low diagnostic value. Ultrasonography, arthrography and MRI can be used to detect rotator cuff muscle pathology. MRI is the best imaging test prior to arthroscopic surgery. Due to lack of understanding of the pathoaetiology, and lack of diagnostic accuracy in the assessment process by many physicians, several opinions are recommended before intervention.\n\nImpingement syndrome is usually treated conservatively, but sometimes it is treated with arthroscopic surgery or open surgery. Conservative treatment includes rest, cessation of painful activity, and physical therapy. Physical therapy treatments would typically focus at maintaining range of movement, improving posture, strengthening shoulder muscles, and reduction of pain. To improve pain and function, physical therapists may employ techniques such as joint mobilization, interferential therapy, acupuncture, soft tissue therapy, therapeutic taping, rotator cuff strengthening, and education regarding the cause and mechanism of the condition. NSAIDs and ice packs may be used for pain relief.\n\nTherapeutic injections of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic may be used for persistent impingement syndrome. The total number of injections is generally limited to three due to possible side effects from the corticosteroid. A recent systematic review of level one evidence showed corticoestroid injections only give small and transient pain relief.\n\nA number of surgical interventions are available, depending on the nature and location of the pathology. Surgery may be done arthroscopically or as open surgery. The impinging structures may be removed in surgery, and the subacromial space may be widened by resection of the distal clavicle and excision of osteophytes on the under-surface of the acromioclavicular joint. Damaged rotator cuff muscles can be surgically repaired.\n\nIf the impingement syndrome is caused by restrictions in the scapulo-thoracic region the treatment may be to ease up the relevant rib restrictions (subluxation). One way of doing this is with a small amplitude high velocity thrust at the angle of the subluxed rib whilst stabilising the transverse process of the vertebra that the rib is attached to on the other side of the spine so that the vertebra does not rotate when the thrust is applied to the rib angle. The thrust applied to the rib should be applied in an inferior and anterior direction perpendicular to the plane of the facet of the costo-transverse process joint on the side of the restriction on the rib that is subluxed. (restricted). Once the scapulo-thoracic restrictions are released it may take 48 hours for the scapula to retro-vert and drop inferiorly back into place its normal anatomical position such that pressure on the impinged nerve is returned to a healthy (un-impinged) level.\n\nImpingement syndrome was reported in 1852. Impingement of the shoulder was previously thought to be precipitated by shoulder abduction and surgical intervention focused on lateral or total acromionectomy. In 1972, Charles Neer proposed that impingement was due to the anterior third of the acromion and the coracoacromial ligament and suggested surgery should be focused on these areas. The role of anteriorinferior aspect of the acromion in impingement syndrome and excision of parts of the anteriorinferior acromion has become a pivotal part of the surgical treatment of the syndrome.\n\nSubacromial impingement is not free of criticism. First, the identification of acromion type shows poor intra- and inter-observer reliability. Second, a computerized three-dimensional study failed to support impingement by any portion of the acromion on the rotator cuff tendons in different shoulder positions. Third, most partial-thickness cuff tears do not occur on bursal surface fibers, where mechanical abrasion from the acromion does occur. Fourth, it has been suggested that bursal surface cuff tears could be responsible for subacromial spurs and not the opposite. And finally, there is growing evidence that routine acromioplasty may not be required for successful rotator cuff repair, which would be an unexpected finding if acromial shape had a major role in generating tendon lesions. In summary, despite being a popular theory, the bulk of evidence suggest that subacromial impingement probably does not play a dominant role in many cases of rotator cuff disease.\n\n"}

Confidential: Lance Armstrong's Secrets\") is a book by sports journalist Pierre Ballester and \"The Sunday Times\" sports correspondent David Walsh. The book contains circumstantial evidence of cyclist Lance Armstrong having used performance-enhancing drugs. The book has only been published in French.\n\nA key witness for the authors was Armstrong's and his teammates' masseuse and soigneur Emma O'Reilly. She revealed that she has taken clandestine trips to pick up and drop off what she concluded were doping products.\n\nMany of the incidents and allegations in the book were later featured in the USADA 2012 report on the US Postal Service cycling team, which led to Armstrong being stripped of most of his titles by the UCI. Many 2012 news reports would feature O'Reilly and others previously reported on in the book.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Walsh had been a fan of Lance. Walsh claims that what first raised doubts in his mind about Armstrong was his bullying of Christophe Bassons at the 1999 Tour de France.\n\nIn April 2001 he was granted an interview with Armstrong. It left Armstrong angry.\n\nIn 2003 Walsh contacted former US Postal soigneur and masseuse Emma O'Reilly. She had been reluctant to talk to the press for years out of loyalty to Armstrong and the team. She claimed that she was motivated to cooperate with Walsh after she came to believe that several riders had died of blood doping. O'Reilly was paid 5,000 pounds, after reviewing several transcripts and chapter drafts and doing PR for the book for Walsh.\n\nArmstrong denied the claims. He and his lawyers filed lawsuits in various countries against the book's authors and the publisher Editions de la Martiniere, as well as against newspaper \"The Sunday Times\" which referenced the book, and the publishers of magazine \"L'Express\" which printed excerpts. His UK lawyers also told \"every UK paper and broadcaster\" to not re-state what was in the book. Armstrong also sued Emma O'Reilly \n\nArmstrongs lawyers in France included Donald Manasse and Christian Charrière-Bournazel. In the UK he retained the Schillings firm, where Gideon Benaim and Matthew Himsworth worked on his libel cases.\n\nArmstrong said the following at a news conference in 2004 regarding the suits:\n\nArmstrong's lawyers first asked the French courts for an \"emergency ruling\" to insert a denial into the book, as the book was to come out shortly before the 2004 Tour de France. Judge Catherine Bezio denied the request. According to the Associated Press, the \"judge . . . called Armstrong's request an \"abuse\" of the legal system\".\n\nArmstrong then sued the UK newspaper \"The Sunday Times\" under English libel law because it published an article referencing the book. The article was ruled in pre-trial to have conveyed the impression that Armstrong was guilty of doping.\n\nArmstrong's lawyers also sued the publisher in a French court regarding eight passages which were claimed to violate French defamation law. They wanted the passages removed or the book pulled from shelves.\n\nWhen Bob Hamman, president of Dallas insurer SCA Promotions, read the book, he announced that his company would not pay $5 million promised to Armstrong for winning his sixth tour until he investigated the allegations. However, an arbitration panel ruled that Hamman had to pay.\n\nIn 2006 the lawsuits came to an end. Armstrong reached an out-of-court settlement for a large sum of money with \"The Sunday Times\", which issued an apologetic statement. Emma O'Reilly didn't have to pay, although the emotional toll on her was severe. The French defamation lawsuit was dropped in 2006, which Armstrong's lawyers claimed was due to him being already \"vindicated on three different occasions\" regarding the allegations. This was referring to UCI's Vrijman report which exonerated Armstrong, the arbitration settlement with SCA, and the aforementioned \"The Sunday Times\" settlement.\n\nUltimately, however, the book proved to be the beginning of the end for Armstrong. While Hamman realized he would likely lose, he believed that the testimony would provide strong circumstantial evidence that Armstrong had indeed doped--strong enough that sporting authorities would be forced to launch an investigation of their own. His hunch was right; officials from the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) asked to review the evidence Hamman had gleaned. Six years later, USADA charged Armstrong with doping. Armstrong opted not to contest the charges, claiming the process was too one-sided. As a result, he was banned from competing in any sport whose national or international federation followed the World Anti-Doping Code--effectively ending his competitive career.\n\nIn October 2012, after USADA released its report on Armstrong's doping operation, \"The Sunday Times\" stated it might attempt to recover the money it lost in the suit, and might sue Armstrong for fraud. On October 22, 2012, after the UCI accepted USADA's report, SCA announced it would attempt to recover the money it lost in its arbitration settlement with Armstrong.\n\n\n"}

It was sold in Europe as the Philips Videopac G7000, in Brazil as the Philips Odyssey and in Japan as Odyssey2 (オデッセイ2 \"odessei2\"). Odyssey² was one of the major three home consoles prior to the 1983 video game market crash, along with Atari 2600 and IntelliVision.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Magnavox pioneered the home video game industry by successfully bringing the first home console to market, the Odyssey, which was quickly followed by a number of later models, each with a few technological improvements (\"see Magnavox Odyssey series\"). In 1978, Magnavox, now a subsidiary of North American Philips, decided to release an all-new successor, Odyssey².\n\nIn 2009, the video game website IGN named the Odyssey² the 21st greatest video game console, out of its list of 25.\n\nThe original Odyssey had a number of removable circuit cards that switched between the built-in games. With the Odyssey², each game could be a completely unique experience, with its own background graphics, foreground graphics, gameplay, scoring, and music. The potential was enormous, as an unlimited number of games could be individually purchased; a game player could purchase a library of video games tailored to their own interest. Unlike any other system at that time, the Odyssey² included a full alphanumeric membrane keyboard, which was to be used for educational games, selecting options, or programming (Magnavox released a cartridge called \"Computer Intro!\" with the intent of teaching simple computer programming).\n\nThe Odyssey² used the standard joystick design of the 1970s and early 1980s: the original console had a moderately sized silver controller, held in one hand, with a square housing for its eight-direction stick that was manipulated with the other hand. Later releases had a similar black controller, with an 8-pointed star-shaped housing for its eight-direction joystick. In the upper corner of the joystick was a single 'Action' button, silver on the original controllers and red on the black controllers. The games, graphics and packaging were designed by Ron Bradford and Steve Lehner.\n\nOne other difference in these controllers is that the earliest releases of the silver joystick were removable. They could be plugged and unplugged from the back of the unit, while all later silver and all black controllers were hardwired into the rear of the unit itself (although the joysticks still can be easily replaced, but not without dismounting the cover deck).\n\nOne of the strongest points of the system was its speech synthesis unit, which was released as an add-on for speech, music, and sound effects enhancement. The area that the Odyssey² may be best remembered for was its pioneering fusion of board and video games: \"The Master Strategy Series\". The first game released was \"Quest for the Rings!\", with gameplay somewhat similar to \"Dungeons & Dragons\", and a storyline reminiscent of J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". Later, two other games were released in this series, \"Conquest of the World\" and \"The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt\", each with its own gameboard.\n\nIts graphics and few color choices, compared to its biggest competitors at the time—the Atari 2600, Mattel's Intellivision and the Bally Astrocade—were its \"weakest point\". Of these systems, the Odyssey² was listed by Jeff Rovin as being the third in total of sales, and one of the seven major video game suppliers.\n\nThe console sold moderately well in the U.S. It was one of the three primary consoles prior to mid-1982, though a distant third, after the Atari 2600 and Mattel Intellivision. By 1983 over one million Odyssey² units were sold in the U.S. alone.\n\nTo sell would-be customers on its technical abilities as a computer-based console, the Odyssey² was marketed with phrases such as \"The Ultimate Computer Video Game System\", \"Sync-Sound Action\", \"True-Reality Synthesization\", \"On-Screen Digital Readouts\" and \"a serious educational tool\" on the packaging for the console and its game cartridges. All games produced by Magnavox/Philips ended with an exclamation point, such as \"K.C. Munchkin!\" and \"Killer Bees!\".\n\nNo third-party game appeared for the Odyssey² in the United States until Imagic's \"Demon Attack\" in 1983. The lack of third-party support kept the number of new games very limited, but the success of the Philips Videopac G7000 overseas led to two other companies producing games for it: Parker Brothers released \"Popeye\", \"Frogger\", \"Q*bert\" and \"Super Cobra\", while Imagic also released \"Atlantis\".\nIn Europe, the Odyssey² did very well on the market. The console was most widely known as the Philips Videopac G7000, or just the Videopac, although branded variants were released in some areas of Europe under the names Philips Videopac C52, Radiola Jet 25, Schneider 7000, and Siera G7000. Philips, as Magnavox's Dutch parent company, used their own name rather than Magnavox's for European marketing. A rare model, the Philips Videopac G7200, was only released in Europe; it had a built-in black-and-white monitor. Videopac game cartridges are mostly compatible with American Odyssey² units, although some games have color differences and a few are completely incompatible, such as Frogger on the European console, being unable to show the second half of the playing field, and Chess on the American model, as the extra hardware module could not work with the console. A number of additional games were released in Europe that never came out in the U.S.\n\nIn Brazil, the console was released as the Philips Odyssey; the Magnavox Odyssey was released in Brazil by a company named \"Planil Comércio\", not affiliated with Philips or Magnavox. Odyssey became much more popular in Brazil than it ever was in the U.S.; tournaments were even held for popular games like \"K.C.'s Krazy Chase!\" (\"Come-Come\" in Brazil). Titles of games were translated into Portuguese, sometimes creating a new story, like \"Pick-axe Pete\", that became \"Didi na Mina Encantada\" (Didi in the Enchanted Mine) referring to Renato Aragão's comedy character, and was one of the most famous Odyssey games in Brazil.\n\nThe Odyssey² was released in Japan in December 1982 by Kōton Trading Toitarii Enterprise (コートン・トレーディング・トイタリー・エンタープライズ, a division of DINGU company) under the name オデッセイ２ (\"odessei2\"). \"Japanese\" versions of the Odyssey² and its games consisted of the American boxes with katakana stickers on them and cheaply printed black-and-white Japanese manuals. The initial price for the console was ¥49,800, which is approximately US$200 in 1982, but roughly $500 in 2018. It was apparently not very successful; Japanese Odyssey² items are now very difficult to find.\n\n\nAn open source console emulator for the Odyssey² called \"O2EM\" is available. It includes Philips Videopac G7400 emulation among other features. The emulator works on Linux, Microsoft Windows, DOS and other platforms, and is included within OpenEmu for Mac OS X. \"O2EM\", (originally not open source) was created in 1997 by computer programmer Daniel Boris and further enhanced by André Rodrigues de la Rocha.\n\nThe open source multi-platform multi-system emulator MESS has Odyssey² support, and is the only emulator to emulate The Voice expansion module without using sound samples.\n\n\n"}

Munn Ice Arena was designed by Daverman Associates of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The original design called for 10,000 seats, but MSU was skeptical they could sell that many tickets. Thus instead, they built a 6,250-seat arena.\n\nThe MSU ice hockey team moved out of Dem Hall following the 1973–74 season and into Munn Ice Arena on Nov. 1, 1974. Michigan State lost its first regular season game at Munn 4-3 in overtime to defending national champion Minnesota Golden Gophers.\n\nAs Michigan State grew into a hockey powerhouse in the 1980s, Munn became home to one of the hottest tickets in the state. Improvements were made to accommodate the program's increasing popularity. In 1985, the heat-exchanger pipes for creating ice were replaced by a direct refrigeration system allowing year-round ice. With increasing coverage, the press box was expanded from one row to two rows accommodating 50 people. A new four-sided scoreboard was added at center ice in 1991. To make handicap-accessible seats, the rink's capacity was reduced to 6,170 in the early 1990s. In 1999–2000, the press box was relocated from center ice to the rink end to make room for 300 club seats on the south end. Luxury boxes were added a year later on the north end of the rink. The additions boosted capacity to 6,470. During the same time the four-sided scoreboard was replaced with two boards at the east and west ends of the rink along with two video replay boards. Recent renovations, which included the installation of additional handicap-accessible platforms, brought capacity to its current 6,114.\n\nFor its first 20 years Munn Ice Arena was the premier on-campus collegiate hockey facility in the country. It is still recognized as one of the top campus hockey rinks in the NCAA. It is also used for high school and amateur hockey and ice skating.\n\nA job at Munn is one of the most highly sought after student jobs on Michigan State's campus. The employees have referred to themselves as \"Munnsters\" (a reference to the 1960s TV show with an intentional misspelling), a title which has recently replaced the word \"staff\" on employee uniforms.\n\nMunn Ice Arena was home to the NCAA's longest consecutive regular-season sell-out streak. On Dec. 19, 1985, Michigan State produced a sell-out crowd versus Northern Michigan University. Michigan State went on to sell-out 323 consecutive regular season home games. The streak ended on Oct. 15, 2004 when Munn failed to fill to capacity for a game against St. Lawrence University.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The basic goal in these sports is to hit the ball or bird over the net back to the opponent. Players score points whenever the opponent fails to return the ball or bird back over the net. The criteria on what is considered a valid return varies between each sport (such as the number of times the ball may be touched or bounced on a player's side before it must go back over the net).\n\nNet sports usually include:\n\n\nAlthough basketball, hockey, water polo and other sports have netting around the goal area designed to more clearly indicate when goals are scored, they are not usually considered \"net sports\". Similarly, lacrosse sticks have a loose netting that is used to catch and fling the ball, but again lacrosse is not usually considered a \"net sport\".\n\nThe Los Angeles Daily Times reports: \"Net sports are unique in that the equipment is light, portable and affordable, and partners and opponents are easy to find.

The Grade I listed building, Sudbrook House, in the park, is now the clubhouse. The patron of the club is His Royal Highness, Prince Andrew, Duke of York.\n\nThe Club was founded in February, 1891, at a meeting at the Greyhound Hotel in Richmond. It briefly leased a course at Old Deer Park, before moving to Sudbrook Park in Petersham, where it has been located ever since.\n\nWithout a clubhouse initially, the members met in the Fox and Duck public house, which they also used for the changing rooms, before obtaining the lease of Sudbrook Park and House in 1898.\n\nThe club runs a full schedule of friendly and competitive golfing activities. It still runs competitions dating back to the first days of the club, of which notable competitions include:\n\nThe Stephenson Challenge Cup trophies, first presented in 1895 to the winners of the singles and foursomes matchplay competitions.\n\nThe Don Memorial Challenge Cup, instituted in 1895, a 36-hole scratch medal which is open to members of invited local golf clubs.\n\nThe Victory and Rube Shields, a series of annual matches played between The Richmond Golf Club and Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club, first played in 1897.\n\nThe club has hosted visits from many professionals including, in 1975, Tom Watson playing his first game of golf in Britain. This was the day before playing in and winning his first Open Championship at Carnoustie, beating Jack Newton in a play-off.\n\nThe course was designed by Tom Dunn in 1896, one of many laid out by Dunn during the explosion of popularity of the sport in the late 19th century.\n\nThe current layout of the course consists of six par 3, eight par 4 and four par 5 holes, with a total length of and a par of 70 (SSS 69).\n\nBetween 2010 and 2012, the course underwent significant renovation, including the construction of 56 new bunkers, as well as improvements to putting greens, tees and the planting of new trees along the fairways. Following these enhancements, the course was awarded first place in the Golf Inc. Monthly, Renovation of the Year for 2012.\n\nThe club's clubhouse, Sudbrook House, was built around 1725 by architect James Gibbs, for John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll. It is built of a combination of white Portland stone and dark red brick, and is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of early eighteenth-century English Palladian architecture.\n\nAt the centre of Sudbrook House is The Cube Room, which is the club's principal dining and function room. The Cube Room is of Baroque style, and as its name suggests, the height (over 30 feet) is the same as the width and length. The interior of The Cube Room is adorned with trophies of arms above the doorways from the Duke of Argyll's military achievements, and the Campbell family coat of arms carved in pine in the great panel above the mirror. The carved marble chimney is the work of Flemish sculptor Jan Michiel Rysbrack.\n\nIn addition to the course, there are extensive practice facilities, including: 2 putting greens, a 250-yard driving range with covered teaching bays, and a short-game practice area for chipping and bunker shots.\n\nThe clubhouse has two bars, one which is reserved exclusively for members, dining rooms, a TV lounge and a snooker room.\n\nThe course also has a pro shop and the clubhouse is available to host weddings and other social events.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "700852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=700852", "title": "Scotiabank Saddledome", "text": "Scotiabank Saddledome\n\nScotiabank Saddledome is a multi-use indoor arena in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Located in Stampede Park in the southeast end of downtown Calgary, the Saddledome was built in 1983 to replace the Stampede Corral as the home of the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League, and to host ice hockey and figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe facility also hosts concerts, conferences and other sporting championships, and events for the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede. It underwent a major renovation in 1994–95 and sold its naming rights, during which its original name of Olympic Saddledome was changed to Canadian Airlines Saddledome. The facility was given the name Pengrowth Saddledome in 2000, after Pengrowth Management Ltd. signed a ten-year agreement. It adopted its current name in October 2010 as Scotiabank signed on as title sponsor.\n\nThe Saddledome is owned by the City of Calgary, who leases it to the Saddledome Foundation, a non-profit organization, to oversee its operation. Since 1996, it has been managed by the Flames. The Saddledome was damaged during the 2013 Alberta floods but was repaired and reopened in time for the 2013–14 NHL season.\n\nThe arena's roof is shaped like a saddle, thus earning the name \"Saddledome\". \n\nCalgary had been served for 30 years by the Stampede Corral when the Calgary Flames arrived in 1980. With a total capacity of 8,700, the Corral was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950, but had fallen below major league standards by the 1970s. The Corral was deemed insufficient for the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1977, leading the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys to fold rather than hope to be a team selected to merge with the NHL.\n\nCalgary's bid to host the 1988 Winter Olympics, coupled with the arrival of the Flames, drove the need to build a new arena. City Council debated the merits of several locations for the city's new Olympic Coliseum, and narrowed their choices down to two areas in the Victoria Park neighbourhood on the east end of downtown. Two other sites, one on the west end of downtown, and a late bid by several businessmen pushing to build the arena in the northern suburb of Airdrie were also considered.\n\nThe Victoria Park Community Association fought the bid to build the arena in their neighborhood, threatening to oppose the city's Olympic bid if necessary. City Council voted on March 3, 1981 to build the proposed 20,000 seat arena on the Stampede grounds, immediately east of the Corral and south of Victoria Park. The community continued to fight the city over rezoning the land to allow for the new arena amidst fears of traffic congestion in their neighbourhood which resulted in numerous costly delays to the start of construction. In a bid to end the battle, Mayor Ralph Klein asked the provincial government in July 1981 to take over the land designated for the arena to bypass the appeals process and force approval. The province supported the city amidst protests by community associations and invoked rarely used powers to overrule planning regulations, allowing construction to begin. The following day, on July 29, 1981, builders began construction of the arena. The International Olympic Committee was impressed that the project was underway, as noted in the XV Olympic Winter Games official report which stated \"The fact that this facility was already being built added credibility to (Calgary's) bid and proved to be a positive factor in demonstrating Calgary's commitment to hosting the Games\".\n\nThe facility was designed by Graham McCourt Architects. While they set out to design a unique building, the idea of a western theme never occurred to Barry Graham or his team. The roof of the building was designed to be a reverse hyperbolic paraboloid, allowing for a pillar free view from all seats and reducing the interior volume by up to one-third when compared to traditional arenas, resulting in reduced heating, lighting and maintenance costs, plus the floating roof can flex to compensate for the city's frequent temperature fluctuations. When the design was unveiled, the roof was immediately referred to as being saddle-shaped. Of 1,270 entries submitted in a contest to name the arena, 735 involved the word Saddle. The winning name in the contest, \"Olympic Saddledome\", was drawn from a hat filled with several similar saddle-themed names. At the time the name received a tepid reception from some, including the chairman of Calgary's Olympic Organizing Committee (OCO), Frank King, who was quoted as saying \"It is neither Olympic nor western, and it's not even dome\".\n\nThe designers won several architectural and engineering awards for their work on the Saddledome, and were honoured by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada at its millennium celebration of architecture in 2000. As of 2008, the Saddledome was still reported as the world record holder for the longest spanning hyperbolic paraboloid concrete shell. The Saddledome was featured on the cover of \"Time\" magazine on September 27, 1987, for an article discussing the city of Calgary and the upcoming 1988 Olympics.\n\nThe location of the Saddledome within Stampede Park allows for easy access to Calgary's CTrain light rail transit system via the Victoria Park/Stampede station that stands parallel to Macleod Trail. The CTrain station, BMO Centre, Stampede Corral and Saddledome are all connected via a Plus 15 pedestrian skyway. Direct vehicle access is gained from the north via 5th Street East or Olympic Way.\n\nThe arena was initially projected to cost $60 million to build, and later revised to over $80 million. Attempts to fast track construction resulted in a $16 million cost overrun, resulting in a final cost of $97.7 million and an eight-month delay in its completion. Builders faced delays while building the roof as numerous adjustments were required to fit the giant concrete slabs between the array of cables that held them in place. Upset with the excess cost, opposition politicians in Alberta demanded a public hearing into the issue. A hearing conducted by the city placed much of the blame on the project manager, while the city and province were required to pay the additional costs.\n\nWhen it opened on October 15, 1983, the Olympic Saddledome served to boost the morale of a city that was experiencing a significant downturn as a result of the international oil market collapse, high interest rates, and the federal government's National Energy Policy. During the first event, an NHL game between the Flames and the Edmonton Oilers, the standard of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was the first thing booed by a population upset with the government's policies. The Oilers defeated the Flames 4–3 in front of a sold out crowd of nearly 17,000 fans.\n\nThe initial seating capacity was 16,605 for hockey as the upper loges were not immediately completed. As the Olympics neared, the Calgary organizing committee spent $1 million to add over 2,600 seats to the upper loges in a bid to alleviate a scandal that resulted from the organizing committee giving its partners and sponsors preferential treatment in ticket sales. With a capacity of 20,016, the International Ice Hockey Federation noted that it was the largest arena ever used at the Winter Games, and called the facility \"the finest international rink in the world\" The International Olympic Committee praised the city's commitment to hosting the Olympics, noting in its official report that constructing the arena prior to being awarded the Games lent credibility to Calgary's bid and positively influenced voters. The Saddledome was the first arena in North America designed to accommodate the larger international ice surface (international rinks are 13 feet wider than NHL rinks). The Saddledome reached its highest capacity in the early '90s at 20,230.\nThe Flames petitioned the City of Calgary and the Saddledome Foundation to upgrade the facility in 1994, requesting renovations to add additional luxury boxes and a new club section. The Flames insisted the upgrades were necessary for the team to remain viable in the arena. They argued it was important that their landlord bring the arena up to the higher standards they felt was required. The team lobbied City Council in the hope it would agree to fund the majority of the $18 million renovation using federal infrastructure funds. At the same time, they rejected a counter proposal for applying a ticket surcharge to pay the cost. Media reports claimed the team was considering relocating out of Calgary if council did not agree. Flames' owners denied the reports, but said they had threatened to build a new rink elsewhere in the city. City Council supported the Flames' proposal in a 9–6 vote following several months of negotiations.\n\nRenovations occurred between 1994 and 1995 and saw the addition of 41 new luxury suites at the top of the lower bowl, an 1,172 seat club section, a new restaurant, expanded offices for the Flames, Saddledome management and Hockey Canada, as well as a significant restructuring of the public concourse and a new parkade structure. The arena remained operational until the spring of 1995 despite ongoing construction, but was closed entirely between April and October 1995. The Saddledome officially reopened on October 25, 1995 for the Flames' first home game of the 1995–96 NHL season.\n\nPrior to its reopening, the Flames signed a deal with Canadian Airlines to rename the facility. Under a twenty-year agreement worth approximately $1 million per year, the arena became the Canadian Airlines Saddledome. Removing the \"Olympic\" moniker was controversial with both the public and City Council, though the city voted in favour of the deal which included the donation of a portion of the naming rights to fund amateur sports within the city. The arena was renamed again in 2000 when Canadian Airlines was acquired by Air Canada and ceased operations. Pengrowth Management Ltd. signed a ten-year agreement that gave the facility the name Pengrowth Saddledome.\n\nThe arena has received cosmetic upgrades in recent years. In 2004, the Flames spent $1 million on a LED \"power ring\" display that lines the facing of the second level. The JumboTron that was installed in 1995 was replaced in 2006 with a new high definition scoreboard. Manufactured by Daktronics, the display has twelve screens and two LED ribbons, and is called the Enmax Energy Board.\n\nThe Saddledome was one of many buildings impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. The event level of the arena was filled with water, also wrecking the high definition scoreboard that had been sitting on the rink floor during the summer downtime, while the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were swamped. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a \"total loss\". He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the 2013–14 Calgary Flames season. Repairs to the facility forced the cancellation of all concerts and agricultural events scheduled for the 2013 Calgary Stampede.\n\nCrews worked around the clock to repair the facility; Saddledome director of building operations Robert Blanchard estimated that 650,000 man hours of work was performed on the facility and noted that they had compressed a six-month project into two. The facility was granted its occupancy permit in late August, and the first event following the Saddledome's reopening was an Eagles concert on September 11. The first hockey game was September 14, a Flames pre-season contest.\n\nAs the home of the Flames, the Saddledome hosted the 1985 NHL All-Star Game, and the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. The Flames have played three Stanley Cup Finals series in the Saddledome: 1986, 1989 and 2004. The arena is also the home of the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League (WHL). The Hitmen won the President's Trophy in 1999 before a WHL playoff record crowd of 17,139. Playing in the largest arena in the WHL, the Hitmen also hold league records for overall attendance (362,227 in 2004–05), as well as single game (19,305 in 2007–08). The Saddledome is also the home of the Calgary Roughnecks of the National Lacrosse League (NLL) and hosted the 2005 NLL All-Star Game. It has twice hosted the NLL Champion's Cup game: 2004 and 2009, both Calgary victories. The stadium was one of the venues for the 2012 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\n\nThe opening of the Saddledome allowed Calgary to host major musical acts that were bypassing the city in the early 1980s, because the city's existing facilities were not large enough to accommodate the industry's top performers.\n\nThe Moody Blues were the first musical act to appear with Stevie Ray Vaughan opening, in November 1983, while Rod Stewart has made the most appearances in the Dome, 11. Many other top acts have made stops in the Saddledome, however the inability of the roof to support the massive light, speaker and special effect rigs that some performers currently use has led the city to again be bypassed for some major tours.\n\nIn addition to hockey and figure skating at the 1988 Olympics, the Saddledome has been the site of numerous major national and international events. The facility has hosted Brier, the Canadian men's curling championship, on four occasions (1997, 2002, 2009 and 2015). It also hosted the women's championship, the Tournament of Hearts in 1995. The 2006 World Figure Skating Championships was also held in the arena. The WWF pay-per-view event was also held at the Saddledome in July 1997. Among non-sporting events, the Saddledome most recently hosted a public address by the Dalai Lama in 2009 that was attended by 15,000 people. In 2005, Queen Elizabeth II attended a celebration of Alberta's centennial at the Saddledome.\n\nIt has also hosted PBR Bud Light Cup events; in 1998 and 1999 the event was known as \"Cody Snyder's Bullbustin'\", and in 2000 and 2001 the event was called the Professional Bull Riders Canadian Open. The Saddledome has also been a host for PBR Canada events.\n\nOn October 3, 2016, the Saddledome hosted a National Basketball Association preseason game between the Toronto Raptors and Denver Nuggets.\n\nOn July 21, 2012, the Saddledome hosted an Ultimate Fighting Championship event, which is . Six years later, on July 28, 2018, the Saddledome hosted another UFC event, which is .\n\nThe arena was also the site of the 1990 Liberal Party leadership convention.\n\nThe Saddledome seats 19,289 for hockey and lacrosse, with different capacities for other events depending on the arena's configuration. It has 72 luxury suites, 41 of which were constructed at the top of the lower bowl in 1995 and 31 were constructed at the top of the second level when the facility was built. There are also six party suites on the corners of the upper loges that are rented on an event by event basis. Sections 115 through 122 of the lower bowl form the Chrysler Club and offers in-seat concession service at Flames games.\n\nThe Chrysler Club features a private dining room available during Flames games, large concerts and private events. Dutton's Canadian Lounge is a sports bar located at the west entrance to the building. There are three additional restaurants within the facility: The HSBC Saddleroom Restaurant, the Alumni Lounge and the King Club. The Iconic Platinum Club is a 188-seat executive club accessible with a purchased membership. It features a private bar and restaurant as well as a fully functional business centre.\n\nThe City of Calgary established the Saddledome Foundation in 1983 and leased the arena for 50-years to the non-profit organization. Its mandate was to \"oversee the operation in a manner that protects taxpayers and benefits amateur sports at the local, provincial and national level\". The foundation is made up of a board of nine directors: three appointed by the city, three appointed by the province, and one each appointed by the Calgary Olympic Development Association (now WinSport Canada), Hockey Canada and the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede. The foundation contracted the Stampede to manage the arena, and through its lease agreements with the Stampede and the Flames, earned 15% of gross concession sales, 50% of net income from luxury suites and executive seating and investment income on the arena's revenues. The Flames signed a 20-year lease in 1983 that earned them 70% of advertising revenues and 90% of ticket revenues. The Stampede earned 85% of concession revenues and all revenue from parking.\n\nAs part of the 1994 deal with the city, the Flames bought out the Stampede's contract for $20 million and took over management of the facility. While the city and Saddledome Foundation paid for the 1994–95 renovations, the new agreement required the Flames to pay for future arena maintenance and repairs, as well as any further renovations. The Flames agreed to manage the arena for 20 years and to contribute $14.5 million toward amateur sport in the city over that time. The Saddledome Foundation retains the responsibility of distributing funds to amateur sport. From its inception through 2007, it had allocated over $20 million toward this cause.\n\nThe Saddledome is one of the oldest arenas in the NHL, fueling speculation that it is due to be replaced. Only Madison Square Garden in New York City and the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York are older than the Saddledome; however, both arenas underwent major renovations in the 2010s, and the New York Islanders are scheduled to move into a new arena in Elmont, New York in 2021. Flames president and chief executive officer Ken King said in 2008 that plans for a new arena were \"five to eight years away\" creating the expectation that the team hoped to have a new arena built for when their lease was due to expire in 2014, but such plans never came to fruition. Team chairman Murray Edwards argues that the ability of the facility to host major events and concerts are growing increasingly limited as the facility ages. Along with Edwards, sports financial analysts also note that newer arenas generate far more revenue for their teams than the Saddledome does for the Flames.\n\nIt is expected that any new arena would also be located either on the Stampede Grounds or elsewhere in downtown Calgary. While NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has lobbied on behalf of both the Flames and the Oilers for government support, Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi and alderman John Mar have stated their opposition using taxpayer money to help fund a new arena. King stated that the Flames have concepts and designs for a new building, but are not ready to release them. Some of the plans being considered for Stampede Park would include lowering the city's C-train light rail transit line below ground and run straight into a new facility.\n\nIn 2015, Calgary Sports and Entertainment proposed CalgaryNEXT—a sports complex in the western downtown area that would feature a new arena and football stadium to replace the Saddledome and McMahon Stadium. The proposal was shot down by Calgary's city council in 2017, who voted to support a \"plan B\" of a new arena on a site adjacent to the existing Saddledome, which is currently used as a parking lot for the Stampede grounds.\n\nOn September 12, 2017, Flames president Ken King stated that the team was no longer pursuing the arena, as \"we've been working for a long time trying to come up with a formula that really works to replace this building and we really put our best foot forward and I’ve come to the conclusion sadly and I’m very disappointed that I don't think we can make a deal that works for us\". Mayor Naheed Nenshi subsequently proposed a partnership wherein portions of the cost of \"plan B\" would be covered by the city, and the rest covered by the team ownership and user surcharges. King objected to this proposal.\n\nCritics alleged that the Flames had been trying to use the issue of a new arena to influence the 2017 municipal elections, where Nenshi was elected for a third term as mayor of Calgary. King denied that this was the case, stating that \"we did not raise this as an election issue: it became an election issue\".\n\n\n"}

Two sheets of canvas or a similar material (the halves) are fastened together with snaps, straps or buttons to form a larger surface. The shelter-half is then erected using poles, ropes, pegs, and whatever tools are on hand, forming an inverted V structure. Small tents like these are often called pup tents\" in American English.\n\nShelter halves are a mainstay of most armies, and are known from the mid 19th century. Often, each soldier carries one shelter-half and half the poles, etc., and they pair off to erect a two-man tent. The size and shape of each half shelter piece may vary from army to army, but are typically rectangular, triangular or lozenge shaped. When time and space allow, some forms of half-shelters can be combined into a larger, more complex tent.\n\nShelter-halves are usually designed to serve double duty as ponchos against the rain, or for the concealment of snipers. While the fabric is often simple olive drab, several nations use camouflaged fabric. The first printed camouflage for soldiers were the Italian \"Telo mimetico\" introduced in 1929 for their half-shelters. The first camouflage uniforms were the Second World War German paratrooper smock, based on their M1931 Splittermuster shelter-halves. Russian Army has used \"Plasch-palatkas\" (literally \"cape-tents\", designed to be used as both a part of a larger tent cover, or an individual weatherproof cape) since 1894, and the modern version, virtually unchanged since, was introduced in 1936, with the camo version being available since 1942. To add some confusion, the ordinary waterproofed cape with a similar name (plasch-nakidka, \"cape-overcoat\") was issued at the same time, but these weren't intended to combine with each other.\n\n"}
