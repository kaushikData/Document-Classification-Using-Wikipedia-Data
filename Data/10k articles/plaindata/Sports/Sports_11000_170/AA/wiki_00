{"id": "30875354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30875354", "title": "Axel jump", "text": "Axel jump\n\nThe Axel is a figure skating jump with a forward take off. It is named after Norwegian figure skater Axel Paulsen who, in 1882, was the first skater to perform the jump. Compared to other common figure skating jumps, an Axel has an extra ½ rotation in the air because of its forward take off. Most skaters perform the jump with counterclockwise rotation, taking off from the left forward outside edge and landing on the right back outside edge. The Axel can also be done as a double jump with 2½ rotations, or as a triple jump with 3½ rotations, or a quadruple Axel with 4½ rotations, but no skater has yet accomplished a quadruple Axel in competition.\n\nThe Axel jump is considered the most technically difficult jump among six types of jumps in single figure skating. According to ISU judging system, a triple Axel jump has a base value of 8.0 points, while a double Axel has that of 3.3 points. This makes a triple Axel the highest base-valued triple jump, above other triple jumps such as the triple Lutz (5.9 points), triple flip (5.3 points), triple loop (4.9 points), triple Salchow (4.3 points), and triple toe loop (4.2 points).\n\nTo perform an Axel, the skater typically approaches the jump on a right back outside edge in a strongly held check position before stepping on a left forward outside edge. He or she vaults over the toe pick of the left skate and \"steps up\" into the jump with the right leg. The skater crosses the left foot in front of the right, which is known as a back spin position (similar to the loop jump), to bring the center of rotation around the right side of the body. This act is often described as a weight shift in the air. Uncrossing the legs during the landing checks the rotation and allows the skater to flow out of the jump with good speed. Most skaters do this when they think they are not going to land the jump and downgrade the jump. \n\nIt is common for skaters to skid the forward take off edge, especially on double and triple Axel jumps, rather than vaulting directly off a clean edge. The skid helps the blade grip the ice on the take off, and is considered an acceptable technique as long as the skid does not make the skater pre-rotate the jump or take off the back of the blade. When the skater makes a mistake in the timing of the jump so that the blade slips off the edge instead of gripping the ice, the result is called a \"waxel,\" often resulting in a fall.\n\nComputerized bio-mechanical studies of skaters performing double and triple Axel jumps have shown skaters typically do not achieve as much height on triple Axel jumps as they do on double Axel jumps. This may seem counter-intuitive because higher jumps ought to give a skater more time to complete the rotation. Instead, during the triple Axel, skaters do not take a big \"step up\" so that they can pull into the rotation position more quickly.\n\n\n\n\nThe jump with half a rotation from forward outside to backward outside is called a \"waltz jump\" or a \"three jump\" in some countries. Any other rotational jump with a forward takeoff is generally considered to be a variation of the Axel. These include:\n\nIn addition, an Axel entrance can be used as a take-off for flying spins. An \"Axel sit spin\" is also known as a \"flying reverse sit spin\", and is essentially an Axel jump landed in a back sit spin. Rarely, skaters may also attempt a double Axel sit spin. In a \"flying open Axel sit spin\", also known as a \"death drop\", the skater achieves an almost horizontal position in the air (by kicking the takeoff leg backwards and to the side, instead of bringing it forward) before landing in a back sit spin.\n\nIn general, the International Skating Union's new ISU Judging System discourages skaters from including variety jumps such as Axel variants in their competitive programs, because they count towards the maximum number of permitted jumps but carry a much lower point value than any double or triple jump that the skater could perform instead. Likewise, the IJS treats all flying spins equally and does not reward the additional difficulty of a double Axel sit spin.\n\nA \"toe Axel\" is not a real jump but is instead the name given to a flawed double toe loop jump.\n\n"}

It is currently used for football and American football matches and is the home stadium of Eintracht Braunschweig and the New Yorker Lions. The stadium is able to hold 24,406 people and was built in 1923.\n\nUp to the early 1920s, Eintracht Braunschweig played its home games at \"Sportplatz an der Helmstedter Straße\", which held 3,000 people. The need for a bigger stadium lead to the construction of the Eintracht-Stadion, located at the \"Hamburger Straße\" in the northern part of the city, one of Braunschweig's main arterial roads, in 1923. The new stadium was opened on 17 June 1923 with a friendly against 1. FC Nürnberg. In 1955, the Eintracht-Stadion hosted the final of the DFB-Pokal, the German Football Association Cup, between Karlsruher SC and FC Schalke 04. Karlsruhe won the match 3–2.\n\nOriginally, the stadium held up to 24,000 people, but with the introduction of Germany's new nationwide Bundesliga in 1963, the capacity was increased to accommodate 38,000 spectators.\n\nIn 1981, financial difficulties forced the club to sell the stadium to the city of Braunschweig. Subsequently, the stadium's official name was changed into \"Städtisches Stadion an der Hamburger Straße\" (\"Municipal Stadium Hamburger Straße\"). The stadium was renovated again in 1995, reducing the capacity to 25,000.\n\nIn 2008, a group of local companies bought the naming rights to the stadium from the city and changed the name back into the original Eintracht-Stadion.\n\nFrom 2009 until 2010 the northern stand was roofed and exapanded. From 2011 until 2013, the stadium was under reconstruction again, this time the main stand was modernized. The stadium's official capacity was reduced from 25,540 to 24,406.\n\nThe Eintracht-Stadion, which is one of the few remaining stadia with a running track in German professional football, is also used as a venue for athletics.\n\nThe stadium hosted the German Athletics Championships in 2000, 2004, and 2010. In 2012, the European Athletic Association awarded Braunschweig the 2014 European Team Championships.\n\nSince 1998, Eintracht-Stadion has also been used as an outdoor concert venue.

The ground was victim to the only German bomb strike on the town during the conflict. The majority of the stadium was damaged beyond financial repair by King's Park and was demolished. Shortly after the war King's Park closed down permanently.\n\nForthbank was the home ground of King's Park F.C. since the late 19th century until 1940 when the ground was destroyed. King's Park also hosted other sporting events at the ground, mostly animal racing. Crowd trouble at a home match against St Johnstone in October 1921 led to King's Park playing a home match against Vale of Leven at Dunblane's Duckburn Park.\n\nForthbank was one of a number of stadiums at the time to host animal racing. Greyhound racing started at Forthbank Park on 11 March 1932 and the track was independent (unlicensed). It was the only track in Scotland that also attempted Cheetah racing. The Scottish Football Association at the time was keen to put an end to this practice as, although the racing provided a financial lifeline to many smaller clubs including King's Park, they feared that it would lead to football becoming too reliant on gambling just like the races. An SFA inspection team deemed that the greyhound track at Forthbank encroached on to the pitch and as such it was removed, along with the source of income.\n\nOn 20 July 1940, the Luftwaffe dropped a bomb on the town of Stirling. The bomb fell on Forthbank partially destroying the stadium. King's Park made temporary repairs to the stadium and played two more games at the ground before the club was closed down. The club was finally given compensation from the War Office in 1953.\n\nThis was not the end to football in Stirling as local business man Thomas Ferguson started up Stirling Albion F.C. in 1945 and shortly after purchased the Annfield estate to construct Annfield. Annfield remained the main football stadium in Stirling until 1993 when Stirling Council constructed Forthbank Stadium, on the outskirts of the town but situated about two thirds of a mile (1km) from the location of the original King's Park's old ground Forthbank Park.\n"}
{"id": "765839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=765839", "title": "Greensboro Coliseum Complex", "text": "Greensboro Coliseum Complex\n\nThe Greensboro Coliseum Complex (GCC) is an entertainment and sports complex located in Greensboro, North Carolina. Opened in 1959, the arena was once one of the largest venues in the South, with a seating capacity of over 23,000. The complex holds eight venues that includes an amphitheater, arena, aquatic center, banquet hall, convention center, museum, theatre and an indoor pavilion. It is the home of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro's \"Spartans\" men's basketball team, the Greensboro Swarm of the NBA G League, as well as the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) with their Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments.\n\nIt has hosted the Men's ACC Tournament twenty-three times since 1967 and the Women's ACC Tournament twelve times since 2000. The Coliseum hosted both tournaments until 2015. Other notable sporting events include the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's \"Final Four\" in 1974 and the East Regionals in 1976, 1979 and 1998. It is also the former home of several professional hockey teams including the Greensboro Generals, Greensboro Monarchs of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) and the National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nThe complex has hosted the \"Central Carolina Fair\" since 1999.\n\nThe complex was first proposed in 1944 by the city's mayor. The idea was to create a war memorial to honor veterans of World War I and World War II. The building was approved by city officials in 1956, followed by a groundbreaking in January 1958. With its opening in 1959, the complex held four venues: War Memorial Auditorium, Town Hall Auditorium, The Blue Room and the Greensboro Coliseum. The complex opened on October 29, 1959 for historic show, \"Holiday on Ice\". Shortly after its opening, the Coliseum began to scout for a hockey team. Partnering with the EHL, the city formed the \"Greensboro Generals\". The team's first match was November 11, 1959, against the Washington Presidents. The Generals won the game 4–1. The Generals would go on to win the EHL Championships.\n\nOver the years, the complex hosted several conventions, sporting and musical events. The Coliseum was part-time home of the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association from 1969 to 1974 after the Houston Mavericks moved to North Carolina in 1969. The Cougars were a \"regional franchise,\" playing \"home\" games in Charlotte (Bojangles' Coliseum), Greensboro (Greensboro Coliseum), Winston-Salem Memorial Coliseum and Raleigh (Dorton Arena). Hall of Fame Coach Larry Brown began his coaching career with the Cougars in 1972. Billy Cunningham was the ABA MVP for the Cougars in the 1972-73 season. Despite a strong fan base the Cougars were sold and moved to St. Louis in 1974.\n\nTo meet demands, the Coliseum expanded its seating to 15,000 in 1972. Six years later, the complex expanded to include an exhibition center, known at the time as the Greensboro Coliseum Complex Exhibition Building (shortened to Exhibition Building). The building's first event was \"Super Flea\", a flea market for the Triad area. In 1991, the Coliseum's manager (Jim Evans) proposed an additional expansion of the complex. This expansion would raise the seating capacity of the Coliseum an additional 8,000 (adding a third tier) to 23,000. It would also see The Blue Room demolished to make way for a small arena in the Exhibition Hall (now called the Special Events Center).\n\nThe venue reopened on December 28, 1993, for the \"Reunion Classic\", a men's basketball game between the UCLA Bruins and NC State Wolfpack. This game was met with controversy as the Coliseum was not fully complete at the time of the game. City officials paid $200,000 to have firefighters on stand by during the game. The Coliseum and the newly expanded exhibition hall did not meet state and city building codes nor fire regulations, because of incomplete construction. Additionally, the Coliseum did not hold the permits to host the event. This decision resulted in city council firing both the Coliseum manager and its contractors, Huber, Hunt and Nichols, Inc. (known for the Spectrum Center, BB&T Center (Sunrise) and the PPG Paints Arena). It was later determined it would take an additional ten months to have the complex comply with regulations. The city added in additional $20 million to the budget to renovate the Coliseum and the auditorium.\n\nAdditional expansion came in 2003 when the complex added The Fieldhouse (formerly the GCC Pavilion). Two years later, the complex renovated the old Town Hall Auditorium into the smaller Odeon Theatre. In 2011, the complex added three additional venues: the White Oak Amphitheatre, the Greensboro Aquatic Center and the ACC Hall of Champions. Since its opening, the complex has been visited by nearly 57 million people and hosts over 800 events per year. In September 2014, the War Memorial Auditorium closed its doors.\n\nOne of the original four buildings of the complex, the Coliseum (also called Coliseum Arena) is one of the oldest buildings on the property. Construction began on the venue in 1958 and was completed in September 1959. Known originally as the \"Greensboro Memorial Coliseum\" (until 1980), the arena hosted its first event on October 29, 1959. At the time, the Coliseum held 7,100 seats, becoming one of the largest arenas on the East Coast. Less than one year after its opening, the Coliseum was about to be visited by presidential nominee Richard Nixon. Nixon sustained a knee injury while campaigning in Greensboro, causing him to stop his campaign tour. Although the tour continued in late August 1960, Nixon still suffered pain from the injury. In September, the first debate between John F. Kennedy and Nixon aired on television, with Nixon appearing to look \"sickly\". Nixon lost the debate and would go on to lose the presidential race. Nixon later stated the knee injury at the Coliseum resulted in him losing the race.\n\nThrough the years, the Coliseum has hosted several sporting events, most notably basketball (see below). The Coliseum has also hosted concerts for over 40 years. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Coliseum was frequented by rock and R&B performers. The first major concert held at the Coliseum was by The Monkees. Elvis Presley played a concert at the Coliseum on April 14, 1972; the footage was used for his final film, entitled \"Elvis on Tour\". Presley performed the Coliseum again on April 21, 1977, one of the final venues of his tour, before his death on August 16. Casting Crowns recorded their live album, entitled \"Until the Whole World Hears... Live\", at the Coliseum on April 24, 2010. Rock band Phish set the attendance record for a concert at the Coliseum on March 1, 2003 with 23,642 attendees.\n\nThe arena has also hosted WJMH's SuperJam since 1997. The music festival has featured prominent artists in the hip hop community including LL Cool J, Soulja Boy, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Plies, Nas, Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, Travis Porter and the Ying Yang Twins.\n\nThe Coliseum was also the site of auditions for \"American Idol\", Season 5 on October 3, 2005. Between Sunday, July 8 and Tuesday, July 10, 2012, it played host to the Greensboro audition stages in the second season of the Fox singer search program \"The X Factor\".\n\nOne of the original four buildings of the complex, the War Memorial Auditorium was one of the oldest buildings on the property, until it was razed in 2014. Along with the original concept, the venue opened in 1959 to house performing arts events. Playing predominately to an African American audience, the auditorium became a notable venue on the chitlin' circuit. James Brown, Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin were among the many performers who played the auditorium during the 1960s. The Rolling Stones played the auditorium during the band's 1965 North American Tour on November 12, 1965. The venue was primarily used for town meetings, theatrical events, religious meetings and concerts. Presidential candidate Barack Obama held a town hall meeting on March 26, 2008 to a full house. Guilford County native Fantasia Barrino gave her first concert, in her home state, during her Back to Me Tour on November 18, 2010.\n\nThe auditorium was torn down in October 2014; a premium parking lot planned on the site will subsidize the Steven Tanger Center for the Performing Arts, to open downtown as a replacement facility in 2019. A closing ceremony took place September 4. An O'Jays concert September 5 was the last event, and items from the auditorium were auctioned off the next week.\n\nOriginally known as the \"Exhibition Building\", the exhibition center opened in 1978. Its purpose was to host business conferences and conventions. The venue was primarily used by \"Super Flea\", the flea market for the Triad area. In 1993, the center was expanded, converting the old Blue Room into a mid-sized arena known as Hall C or the East Wing. In its current state, the 167,000-square foot center \"includes three exhibition halls, a 4,500-seat mini-arena and eight meeting rooms...\" The arena is often used for musical performances during the Central Carolina Fair. It is also utilized by Greensboro College men's and women's basketball home games. Other sporting events include boxing and UFC matches. The arena will often host concerts and comedy shows.\n\nOpening in 1958 as the \"Town Hall Auditorium\", the Odeon Theatre is a small venue primarily used for community events. The original auditorium housed 1,000 seats. In 2004, the auditorium was converted to the smaller theatre and reopened in March 2005.\n\nThe newest addition to the complex, the White Oak Amphitheatre is the first outdoor venue for the Triad area. The venue was originally proposed in 2007 along with the aquatic center. The city purchased the nearby Canada Dry bottling plant to allow space for the amphitheatre. Construction began in 2010 and was completed in June 2011. The first concert for the venue was by The Beach Boys on June 5, 2011 to a crowd of 4,000 spectators. The amphitheatre is expected to operate from April to October, hosting community, comedy and musical events. The project cost $946,000 to construct.\n\nKnown simply by one name (although acknowledged as Greensboro Coliseum Fieldhouse), the Fieldhouse is a standalone exhibition hall adjacent to the Special Events Center. The 30,000 sq ft space opened in March 2003 as the \"GCC Pavilion\". The project was designed by SKA Consulting Engineers. In 2016, the Fieldhouse became the home of the Greensboro Swarm, the NBA Development League (later called the NBA G League) affiliate of the Charlotte Hornets. To accommodate the team the Fieldhouse was renovated with a permanent roof, locker room, and seating for 2,118.\n\nAnother expansion project for the complex is the new aquatic center. The center features three main pools including a warm-up and training pool. The main pool is used for events by nearby high schools, colleges, and USA Swimming events, and can hold eight 50-meter (long course) lanes or 20 short course competition lanes plus a warmup pool. The complex also includes springboard and platform diving facilities and hosts meets for USA Diving. The facility has an available classroom and a 24'×19' video screen, as well as a concessions stand and swim store. The venue hosts events in competitive swimming and diving, synchronized swimming and water polo up through USA National competition levels. It also hosts the National Mermaid Convention. Paid parking is available. The project began in 2010 along with the amphitheatre and cost $18.8 million to build. The City of Greensboro provided a live cam feed to watch the progress of the construction. The venue has hosted the 2012 U.S. Masters Swimming Spring National Championship., the 2015 NCAA Women's Division I Swimming and Diving Championships, and other tournaments as well.\n\nTo commemorate its legacy with the ACC Tournaments, the complex opened a museum in 2011 to show the history of the ACC. The venue celebrates the past, present and future of the ACC. It features numerous exhibits including an interactive broadcast booth, memorabilia, a video globe and school mascots.\n\nOpened in March 2011, The Terrace is one of new expansions for the complex. Its main purpose is a banquet hall and will be used for speaking events as well as weddings. The Terrace is an indoor venue located in between the auditorium and Coliseum.\n\nThe hockey history of Greensboro began in 1959, when the Greensboro Generals of the Eastern Hockey League arrived and competed until the league folded in 1973. The team moved to the Southern Hockey League for four seasons until it too ceased operations in January 1977.\n\nGreensboro hockey's modern era began with the establishment of the Greensboro Monarchs of the East Coast Hockey League, who played from 1989–90 to 1994–95. When the American Hockey League expanded southward in 1995, it invited Greensboro to join; the new team took the Monarchs nickname, but attempted to draw a more regional fan base by labeling themselves the Carolina Monarchs.\n\nWhen the Hartford Whalers announced their move to Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1997 as the Carolina Hurricanes, they leased the Coliseum for two years while waiting for the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (now PNC Arena) in Raleigh to be completed. Subjected to ticket price increases and unwilling to support a team that was destined for Raleigh, Greensboro hockey fans rarely filled the arena for Hurricane games. Meanwhile, Triangle fans were unwilling to make the hour-long drive across Interstate 40 to Greensboro. As a result, the Hurricanes played in front of some of the smallest NHL crowds since the 1950s. During the 1998–99 season, the team curtained off most of the upper deck for home games in an effort to artificially create scarcity in the ticket market, force would-be attendees to purchase higher-priced tickets, and hide what national media mocked as \"green acres\" of empty seats.\n\nOnce the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena was completed and the Hurricanes moved out, the plan was that the Monarchs, who spent those two years in New Haven, Connecticut, as the Beast of New Haven, would move back into the venue as a Hurricanes affiliate. Monarchs owner Bill Black tried to bring the Monarchs back to Greensboro, but the Hurricanes refused to claim the Monarchs as their affiliate. After the deal fell through, Bill Black tried to sell shares to the public in a final attempt to bring the Monarchs back to Greensboro.\n\nRather than leave the Coliseum without a hockey team for the first time in more than 10 years, a new hockey team was founded, the Greensboro Generals, returning the city to the East Coast Hockey League. The Generals competed in the arena until 2004, when they were terminated by the ECHL due to poor performance and lackluster support from the community. Increased operating expenses from the ECHL Players Union and overhead costs as a result of recent Coliseum renovations significantly affected the Generals' ability to promote within the community. It was revealed that after the team folded, nearly all of the money used to support the team over and above ticket revenues, could have been covered by Coliseum advertising revenue that was purchased as a direct result of the hockey team's presence.\n\nAfter the Generals folded, the complex saw a significant revenue drop in local advertising and to this day, the Coliseum operations must be supplemented with nearly $2 million a year from the city government.\n\nThe Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association played a majority of their home games at the Greensboro Coliseum during their tenure in North Carolina from 1969 to 1974, before moving to St. Louis and becoming the Spirits of St. Louis. The Greensboro City Gaters played their first and only season as a charter franchise of the Global Basketball Association minor league in 1991–1992 in the Greensboro Coliseum.\n\nThe Greensboro Coliseum has played host to many college basketball tournaments. The Atlantic Coast Conference has held their men's basketball tournament at the Coliseum 23 times since 1967, the most of any venue. This is in part because the arena was within seven hours' drive of the conference's original footprint, and is within an hour of most of the fanbases of the conference's heartland in North Carolina. The Greensboro Coliseum also hosted the Big Four Tournament from 1971 to 1981. The Coliseum hosted the 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015 men's tournament. It has also hosted the MEAC Men's Basketball Tournament ten times.\n\nIn 1974, the Coliseum hosted the NCAA Men's Final Four. It was the host of the Southern Conference men's basketball tournament from 1996 to 1999. The Coliseum has been the home for the ACC Women's Basketball Tournament since 2000, and is contracted through 2015. It has played host to 12 Men's NCAA Tournaments, most notably the 1974 Final Four and Lehigh's upset of Duke in 2012. It hosted the NCAA Tournament in 2006 and 2009, when it served as a first and second round site. It hosted the Greensboro Regional in the Women's NCAA Tournament in 2007 and 2008. The Coliseum is the first arena to host three basketball tournaments in consecutive weeks. The Coliseum has also hosted NBA basketball, high school basketball, and the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1989, the Wake Forest Demon Deacons basketball team played a portion of its home schedule at the Coliseum, usually games against popular opponents that could not be accommodated in the smaller Winston-Salem Memorial Coliseum. In practice, Wake Forest played most of its ACC games during this period at the Coliseum. \n\nSince 2010, the UNC Greensboro Spartans men's basketball team has played at the Coliseum, having moved there from the smaller Fleming Gymnasium on the campus of UNCG.\n\nIn October 2015, the Charlotte Hornets chose Greensboro for the location of their new NBA D-League team the Greensboro Swarm. The Swarm began play at the Fieldhouse in the 2016–17 season.\n\nOn October 6, 2016, the Hornets played a preseason game against the Boston Celtics at Greensboro Coliseum.\n\nThe Coliseum first saw an arena football team when the Greensboro Prowlers of the af2 league played in the Coliseum from 1999 until 2004. The team folded due to a poor record and lack of fan support. The Greensboro Revolution of the National Indoor Football League played here in 2006 and 2007. The team ceased operations on January 23, 2008.\n\nBeginning in 2018, the Coliseum will be home to indoor football again as the Carolina Cobras of the National Arena League.\n\nThe Coliseum has hosted many events over time, including Monster Jam, Arenacross, the PBR, , the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, and large-scale religious gatherings.\n\nFormer North Carolina senator Kay Hagan held her Senate Victory Party at the Special Events Center on November 4, 2008. The Greensboro Coliseum has also hosted the National Figure Skating Championships twice.\n\nIn addition, its neighboring auditorium and special events center have hosted concerts, trade shows, broadway theatre shows, and similar events. The auditorium, which was not included in the 1993 renovation of the complex, will soon be renovated to include a banquet hall. In 2002, the 1st Annual King of the Concrete indoor go-kart race was held at this facility. In February 2016, The Coliseum is scheduled to host the 2016 US Olympic Table Tennis Trials.\n\nGreensboro Coliseum has had a wide history with hosting professional wrestling going back to the territorial days of Jim Crockett Promotions. It has hosted a number of NWA and WCW events through the years, including the first 4 Starrcade events in 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986, as well as the 1990 WrestleWar event. WWE has also held events at the Greensboro Coliseum, including in 1998, the 1999 King of the Ring and the 2001 Survivor Series when Team WWF defeated Team Alliance and Alliance disbanded forever. Most recently WWE revived the Starrcade event and held it at the Colosseum on November 25, 2017.\n\nThe venue is located between and within an hour's drive of North Carolina's five largest cities: Charlotte, Raleigh, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and Durham.\n\n\n"}

The stadium was opened in 2017 for the FIFA Confederations Cup. Initially, it was planned to be completed by December 2008, which was changed to late 2011 and changed again numerous times until it was scheduled to open in 2017. As of May 2017, the stadium was 518% late and 548% over budget. The stadium has a capacity of 67,000 people. It was called Saint Petersburg Stadium during the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup. \n\nAt a cost of $1.1 billion at current exchange rates, it is considered one of the most expensive stadiums ever built.\n\nThe competition between architectural projects was won by Kisho Kurokawa's \"The Spaceship\". The design of the stadium is a modified and enlarged version of Toyota Stadium in Toyota City, Japan, which was also designed by Kurokawa. The stadium was built on the location where the former Kirov Stadium used to stand before it was demolished.\n\nIn January 2009 \"The St. Petersburg Times\" reported that the project was now to be funded by the city government of St Petersburg, with Gazprom switching to build a separate skyscraper project. The City Hall had to step in after Gazprom declined to invest any further money into the stadium's construction.\n\nOn 25 July 2016 the general contractor, Inzhtransstroy-Spb, issued a statement that the city authorities have failed to pay 1 billion rubles ($15.8 million at the current exchange rate) worth of construction work and stopped the work. The next day the contract was terminated. On 1 August there were reports of wind damage to parts of the metal sheathing, and a flood.\n\nIn the end of August 2016, the new general contractor, Metrostroy, resumed construction works on the site.\n\nThe first official match held at the stadium was the Russian Premier League game between FC Zenit Saint Petersburg and FC Ural on 22 April 2017.

It replaced the RCA Dome as the home field of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts and opened on August 16, 2008. The stadium was constructed to allow the removal of the RCA Dome and expansion of the Indiana Convention Center on its site. The stadium is on the south side of South Street, a block south of the former site of the RCA Dome. In 2006, prior to the stadium's construction, Lucas Oil Products secured the naming rights for the stadium at a cost of $122 million over 20 years. The venue also serves as the current home for the United Soccer League's Indy Eleven.\n\nThe architectural firm HKS, Inc. was responsible for the stadium's design, with Walter P Moore working as the Structural Engineer of Record. The stadium features a retractable roof and window wall, thus allowing the Colts and the Eleven to play both indoors and outdoors. The field surface was originally FieldTurf but was replaced in 2018 with Shaw Sports Momentum Pro. The exterior of the new stadium is faced with a reddish-brown brick trimmed with Indiana Limestone, similar to several other sports venues in the area such as Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Hinkle Fieldhouse, and the Fairgrounds Coliseum.\n\nLucas Oil Stadium has a seating capacity of 67,000 and covers approximately 1.8 million square feet. The stadium offers 139 suites, two club lounges, two exhibit halls and 12 meeting rooms. There are also 360 degree ribbon boards and two massive high definition video boards. An underground walkway directly connects the stadium to the Indiana Convention Center. \n\nOther features include:\n\nThe stadium's retractable roof can open or close in 9 to 11 minutes. It is composed of two panels that each weigh 2.5 million pounds. \n\nThe home team determines if the roof is to be opened or closed 90 minutes before kickoff. The roof remains open unless precipitation or lightning is within the vicinity of the stadium, the temperature drops below , or wind gusts are greater than , in which case the roof operators will close the roof. Once the roof is closed, it is not allowed to be reopened.\n\nThe retractable north window offers a view of downtown Indianapolis during games, concerts and other events due to the stadium's angled position on the city block. \n\nThe four gates leading into Lucas Oil Stadium are each named for sponsoring corporation: Lucas Oil, Verizon, HHGregg, and Huntington Bank. The ground-level concourses of their respective gates feature banners and floor coverings with the corporations' logos, advertisements and merchandise displays.\nAnnual events include:\n\nUpcoming events include:\n\nSignificant past events included:\n\nThe first games played at Lucas Oil Stadium occurred on August 22, 2008 and were part of the PeyBack Classic, featuring Indiana High School Football games between Noblesville High School and Fishers High School in Game 1, followed by New Palestine High School and Whiteland Community High School in Game 2. On November 26, 2008, Cardinal Ritter High School became the first high school to win a state championship on the field, beating Sheridan High School 34-27 for the class A state title.\nThe Colts faced the Chicago Bears in a rematch of Super Bowl XLI in their first regular season game in the stadium. \n\nThe stadium hosted its first soccer game on August 1, 2013, when Chelsea played Inter Milan in a first-round game of the International Champions Cup, drawing 41,983 fans.\nAs of 2018, Lucas Oil Stadium serves as the home field for the United Soccer League's Indy Eleven, replacing the venue they used while in the North American Soccer League, Carroll Stadium.\n\nDrum Corps International (DCI) announced on August 9, 2006 that it would move its corporate offices to Indianapolis and that the DCI World Championships would be the inaugural event for the stadium and would be held at Lucas Oil Stadium every year through 2018. In 2015, Drum Corps International and the city of Indianapolis announced a 10-year contract extension, allowing the World Championships to continue through 2028. The competition was held for the first time at Lucas Oil Stadium in 2009.\n\nOther regular events include the Bands of America Grand National Championships and the Indiana Marching Band State Finals, both major events for the city in Marching band competitions.\n\nThe total cost of Lucas Oil Stadium was $720 million. The stadium is being financed with funds raised by the State of Indiana and the City of Indianapolis, with the Indianapolis Colts providing $100 million. Marion County has raised taxes for food and beverage sales, auto rental taxes, innkeeper's taxes, and admission taxes for its share of the costs. Meanwhile, there has been an increase in food and beverage taxes in the 8 surrounding doughnut counties (with the exception of Morgan County) and the sale of Colts license plates.\n\nThe County Commissioners of each county voted whether to levy the 1% food and beverage tax proposed by Marion County. Sweetening the deal for those counties was the fact that half of the revenue from the tax would stay in the respective county. Morgan County was the only county to turn down the offer, yet in a later vote, it levied its own 1% tax – thus keeping \"all\" of its additional generated revenue.\n\nIn August 2006, the Capital Improvement Board, which operates the stadium, estimated that daily operating expenses of the new stadium would be $10 million more per year than the RCA Dome. The board urged the Indiana General Assembly to authorize funding to cover the shortfall. The Indiana Legislature considered a bill to raise sales taxes statewide to cover the shortfall, however this plan faces stiff opposition from legislators outside the Indianapolis metro area.\n\nThe assembly ultimately authorized a tax increase in Indianapolis-Marion County. In addition, the CIB trimmed staff and cut $10 million from its budget. Still, the agency anticipated a $20 million operating deficit for Lucas Oil Stadium in 2009. Anticipated expenses are $27.7 million—far outstripping the $7.7 million CIB expects to collect from its share of revenue from stadium events. The Colts organization has been criticized for the favorable lease terms and the high percentage of revenue it can keep under the terms of its agreements with the stadium authorities and there have been calls for the team to cover the shortfalls of the CIB. The Colts responded to these criticisms in an open letter to fans on September 16, 2009.\n\nOn September 8, 2013 after the Colts defeated the Oakland Raiders in the season opener, a rail over the opposing team tunnel collapsed injuring two fans. One fan was transferred to the hospital for evaluation. No serious injuries were reported.\n\nOn September 3, 2015, three fans were injured by a bolt that fell from the roof of the stadium as it was being opened during an NFL preseason game against the Cincinnati Bengals. The stadium was pronounced safe by officials, but the roof was to remain closed for events until a final investigation was completed as to why the bolt fell.\n\n"}

The museum is served by the Rambuteau Paris Métro station.\n\nExhibits focus on the relationships between humans and the natural environment through the traditions and practices of hunting. The museum has been characterized by the \"Smithsonian\" magazine as “one of the most rewarding and inventive in Paris\", and is described in tourist guidebooks and other media as \"quirky, astonishing, strange and eclectic\".\n\nThe museum was founded in 1964 by wealthy French industrialist rugmaker François Sommer (1904-1973) and his wife Jacqueline, who were avid hunters and conservationists. It is operated by the Fondation de la Maison de la Chasse et de la Nature, which the couple also founded. The museum is housed within the Hôtel de Guénégaud (1651-1655), the only private mansion designed by architect François Mansart that still exists. Since 2002, it is also housed in the Hôtel de Mongelas (1703), as well. It opened in 1967 and was thoroughly renovated in 2007.\n\nThe museum, housed in the limestone Hôtel de Guénégaud under a 99-year lease, is made up of multiple rooms paneled in wood and outfitted with bronze decorative fixtures designed by Brazilian sculptor Saint Clair Cemin, and made to look like vines, antlers and tree branches. The ceiling of one room has been covered in owl feathers in a work called \"The Night of Diana\" by contemporary Belgian artist Jan Fabre, previously known for decorating the ceiling of the Royal Palace in Brussels with more than a million and a half beetle wing cases. The museum's rooms have names such as Room of the Boar, Salon of the Dogs and Cabinet of the Wolf.\n\nThe museum's chief curator is Claude d'Anthenaise.\n\nThe collection is partly made up of objects and works that were gathered personally by François and Jacqueline Sommer: their collection totalled nearly three thousand hunting-related objects, including nearly five hundred engravings.\n\nThe museum displays ancient and contemporary works together: in the Salon of the Dogs, a collection of gold dog collars throughout the ages is displayed alongside 17th-century portraits of Louis XIV's pets and a small white version of the Scottie dog sculpture \"Puppy\" by contemporary American ceramic artist Jeff Koons. It also includes fantastical elements: an alcove dedicated to unicorns contains a small curio cabinet, the 2005 video \"Unicorn\" by French video artist Maïder Fortune, work by contemporary artist Jean-Michel Othoniel, and a 1957 sculpture by Janine Janet.\n\nThe museum is organized around three themes: weapons and other instruments of hunting such as guns and horns; hunting products such as trophies and taxidermied animals; and artistic representations of wildlife and hunting such as paintings, prints, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics and furniture.\n\nThe museum includes an array of weaponry from the 16th through to the 19th centuries, including spears, cross bows, hunting horns, powder flasks and guns. Guns include ones owned by Louis XIII, Marie-Thérèse of Austria, Napoleon Ier, and Napoleon III.\n\nThe museum houses hundreds of trophies and taxidermied animals from Europe, Africa, Asia and America. These include a polar bear, lion, tiger, cheetah, fox, rhinoceros, bison, water buffalo and many birds. In the Room of Trophies, \"Le Souillot\", a wall-mounted animatronic albino boar head by contemporary French artist Nicolas Darrot, speaks to museum visitors in French.\n\nThe museum includes representations of hunting and nature scenes by historically significant artists such as Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens, German Renaissance painter Lucas Cranach the Elder, 17th-century Flemish painter Frans Snyders, official 'painter of the hunt and animals' Alexandre-François Desportes and naturalistic French Rococo painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry, as well as contemporary artists such as Belgian multidisciplinary artist and sculptor Jan Fabre, French glass sculptor Jean-Michel Othoniel and contemporary French watercolour painter Francoise Petrovitch.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "865871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=865871", "title": "Olympiastadion (Berlin)", "text": "Olympiastadion (Berlin)\n\nOlympiastadion () is a sports stadium in Berlin, Germany. It was originally built by Werner March for the 1936 Summer Olympics. During the Olympics, the record attendance was thought to be over 100,000. Today the stadium is part of the Olympiapark Berlin.\n\nSince renovations in 2004, the Olympiastadion has a permanent capacity of 74,475 seats and is the largest stadium in Germany for international football matches. Olympiastadion is a UEFA category four stadium and one of the world's most prestigious venues for sporting and entertainment events.\n\nBesides its use as an athletics stadium, the arena has built a footballing tradition. Since 1963, it has been the home ground of the Hertha BSC football team. It hosted three matches in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. It was renovated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, when it hosted six matches, including the final. The German Cup (DFB-Pokal) final match is held each year at the venue. The Olympiastadion Berlin served as a host for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup as well as the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final.\n\nDuring the 1912 Summer Olympics, the city of Berlin was designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to host the 1916 Summer Olympics. Germany's proposed stadium for this event was to be located in Charlottenburg, in the Grunewald Forest, to the west of Berlin—thus the stadium was also known as \"Grunewaldstadion\". A horse racing-course already existed there which belonged to the Berliner Rennverein, and even today the old ticket booths survive on Jesse-Owens-Allee. The government of Germany decided not to build in the nearby Grunewald forest, or to renovate buildings that already existed. Because of this desire, they hired the same architect who originally had built the \"Rennverein\", Otto March.\n\nMarch decided to bury the stadium in the ground (\"Erdstadion\", in German). However, the 1916 Olympic Games were cancelled due to World War I. In the 1920s the first buildings of a school, the \"Deutsches Sportforum\" (German Sport Forum), dedicated to the teaching of professors of physical education and the study of sport science were built northeast of the stadium site. From 1926 to 1929, Otto March's sons (Werner and Walter) were assigned to build an annex for these institutions, though the finalization was delayed until 1936.\n\nIn 1931, the International Olympic Committee selected Berlin to host the 11th Summer Olympics. Originally, the German government decided merely to restore the earlier Olympiastadion (Olympic Stadium) of 1916, with Werner March again retained to do this.\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power in Germany (1933), they decided to use the Olympic Games in 1936 for propaganda purposes. With these plans in mind, Adolf Hitler ordered the construction of a great sports complex in Grunewald named the \"Reichssportfeld\" with a totally new Olympiastadion. Architect Werner March remained in charge of the project, assisted by his brother Walter.\n\nConstruction took place from 1934 to 1936. When the Reichssportfeld was finished, it was 1.32 square kilometres (326 acres). It consisted of (east to west): the Olympiastadion, the Maifeld (Mayfield, capacity of 50,000) and the Waldbühne amphitheater (capacity of 25,000), in addition to various places, buildings and facilities for different sports (such as football, swimming, equestrian events, and field hockey) in the northern part.\n\nWerner March built the new Olympiastadion on the foundation of the original Deutsches Stadion, once again with the lower half of the structure recessed 12 meters below ground level.\n\nThe capacity of the Olympiastadion reached 110,000 spectators. It also possessed a special stand for Adolf Hitler and his political associates. At its end, aligned with the symmetrically-designed layout of the buildings of the Olympischer Platz and toward the Maifeld, was the Marathon Gate with a big receptacle for the Olympic Flame.\n\nThe Maifeld (Mayfield) was created as a huge lawn (112,000 square metres, 28 acres) for gymnastic demonstrations, specifically annual May Day celebrations by the government. The area was surrounded by 19 metres of land elevation (62 ft), even though the Olympiastadion (to the east) was only 17 metres (55 ft) high. The total capacity was 250,000 people, with 60,000 in the large stands that extended at the west end.\n\nAlso located there were the Langemarck-Halle (below) and the Bell Tower (rising high). The walls were built with sturdy stone from the area of the Lower Alps, and also feature equine sculptures (work of Josef Wackerle). This consisted of huge halls built under the stands of the Maifeld. Pillars were raised on which hung flags and shields commemorating all the forces that participated in a battle fought in Langemark (West Flanders, Belgium) on 10 November 1914, during the First World War. Since 2006, the ground floor is home to a public exhibit providing historical information on the area of the former Reichssportfeld.\n\nDuring the 1936 Olympics, the Maifeld was used for polo and equestrian dressage events.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the occupying forces of the British Army (Berlin Infantry Brigade) annually celebrated the Queen's Official Birthday on the Maifeld and used it for a variety of sporting activities including cricket. Starting in 2012, Maifeld became home to the Berlin Cricket Club.\n\nThe Bell Tower crowned the western end of the Reichs Sportfield planted amid the tiers of the Maifeld stands. It was 77 metres (247 ft) high. From its peak could be observed the whole city of Berlin. During the games, it was used as observation post by administrators and police officials, doctors and the media.\nIn the tower was the Olympic Bell. On its surface were the Olympic Rings with an eagle, the year 1936, the Brandenburg Gate, the date 1.-16. August and a motto between two swastikas: \"I call the youth of the world\" and \"11. Olympic Games Berlin\" – although the games were the 10th (Summer) Olympics, they were the Games of the XI Olympiad.\n\nThe Bell Tower was the only part of the Reichssportfeld that was destroyed in the war. The Third Reich used the tower's structure to store archives (such as films). The Soviet troops set its contents on fire, turning the tower into a makeshift chimney. The structure emerged from the fire severely damaged and weakened.\n\nIn 1947, the British engineers demolished the tower; however, it was reconstructed accurately in 1962. The Olympic Bell (which had survived the fire and remained in its place in the tower) fell 77 metres and cracked and has been incapable of sounding since then. In 1956, the bell was rescued, only in order to be used as a practice target for shooting with anti-tank ammunition. The damaged old bell survives and serves as a memorial.\n\nThe recreation of the tower was carried out from 1960 to 1962, once again by the architect Werner March, following the original blueprints. The present tower became an important tourist destination offering a panorama of Berlin, Spandau, the Havel Valley, Potsdam, Nauen and Hennigsdorf.\n\nThe most significant battle around the Olympiastadion was in April 1945 when the Soviet army fought to capture it. This was during the final battle of the Second World War in Europe, with the total invasion of Berlin as the Allies' target. The Olympiastadion survived the war almost untouched; it only suffered the impact of machine gun shots.\n\nAfter the war, the former \"Reichssportfeld\" became the headquarters of the British military occupation forces. The administration settled in the northeastern buildings designed by the March brothers in the 1920s, which the Third Reich had used for official sport organisations such as the Reich Academy of Physical Training and extended by 1936, adding the \"Haus des deutschen Sports\" (House of German Sports) and other buildings (which belong since 1994 to the Olympiapark Berlin, a central sporting facility of the City of Berlin). Soon, the British forces renovated war-damaged buildings but also converted interiors to their specific needs (one gymnasium was converted into a dining hall, another into a garage). From 1951 to 2005, the Olympischer Platz had a giant antenna transmitting for all the portable radios in Berlin.\n\nFrom then until 1994 and their departure, British forces held an annual celebration of the Queen's Official Birthday in the Maifeld with thousands of spectators from Berlin present. During the 1960s, American military and high school football teams introduced hundreds of thousands of Berliners to American football at the stadium in exhibition games.\n\nDuring those years, Bundesliga football matches were played in the Olympiastadion, with Hertha BSC as local team. In the Maifeld, several competitions of football, rugby and polo were staged too. In the summers, the Waldbühne resumed its classical music concerts, and playing movies. The theatre was also used as an improvised ring for boxing matches.\n\nIn 1998, Berliners debated the destiny of the Olympiastadion in light of the legacy it represented for Germany. Some wanted to tear the stadium down and build a new one from scratch, while others favoured letting it slowly crumble \"like the Colosseum in Rome\". Finally, it was decided to renovate the Olympiastadion.\n\nFIFA chose it as one of the venues of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The State of Berlin hired a consortium composed of Walter Bau AG and \"DYWIDAG\" that won the €45 million franchise. The consortium took charge of the operation of the facilities together with Hertha BSC and the Government of Berlin after the remodelling. On 3 July 2000, the renovation began with a ceremony presided over by the Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, accompanied by Eberhard Diepgen (Mayor of Berlin), Franz Beckenbauer and Prof. Dr. Ignaz Walter.\n\nThe re-inauguration celebrations of the new Olympic Stadium were carried out on 31 July 2004, and 1 August 2004. On that day, Saturday, the party began with performances from Pink, Nena and Daniel Barenboim. It culminated at night with the opening ceremony. On day two, friendly matches were played between different categories of the club Hertha BSC and visiting teams. On 8 September 2004, Brazil played Germany.\n\nIn 2011, the venue hosted the World Culture Festival organized by the Art of Living where 70,000 people meditated for peace.\n\nIn 2018, the venue hosted the 2018 European Athletics Championships.\n\nWith the intention of creating a more intimate atmosphere for football games, the playing field was lowered by . Approximately of sand was excavated. The lower tier of seating in the stadium was demolished and rebuilt at a completely different angle of inclination.\n\nThe roof was extended to cover a total of , with 20 roof-supporting columns carrying a weight of of steel. The roof rises over the seats and is made up of transparent panels that allow sunlight to stream in during the day. The western portion (on the Marathon Arch) is open to reveal the Bell Tower to the spectators.\n\nThe conservation factor of the Olympiastadion as a historical monument was also considered, especially with respect to the preservation of the natural stone blocks. After criticisms, the colour of the athletics track around the game field was changed from red to blue, reflecting the colours of Hertha BSC.\n\nThe renovations used of concrete and of pre-cast reinforced concrete elements. Some of concrete was demolished and removed and of natural stone was refurbished.\n\nThe Olympiastadion was equipped with the latest technology in artificial illumination and sound equipment. It has 113 VIP stands, a set of restaurants, and two underground garages (for 630 cars). The total cost of the remodelling and amplification was €242 million.\n\nThe new Olympic Stadium has the highest all-seated capacity in Germany. It has a permanent capacity of 74,475 seats. The upper tier has 31 seating rows at an average slope of 23° and houses 36,455 seats, of which 36,032 are regular seats, 290 are seats on the press stand and 133 are seats in skyboxes. The lower tier has 42 seating rows at an average angle of 25,4° and houses 38,020 seats, of which 32,310 are regular seats, 560 are box seats, 563 are lounge seats (expandable to 743), 4,413 are business seats and 174 are wheelchair spaces.\n\nFor certain football matches, such as those between Hertha BSC and FC Bayern München, the capacity can be temporarily expanded. This is made by the addition of mobile grandstand over the Marathon Arch. The extended capacity reached 76,197 seats in 2014.\n\nThe only stadiums in Germany that have higher total capacities are the Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund and the Allianz Arena in Munich. However, the Signal Iduna Park and the Allianz Arena have both seating and standing areas, and their all-seated capacities are lower than that of the Olympiastadion. The total capacity of the Allianz Arena is also lower than the extended capacity of the Olympiastadion.\n\nThe stadium has been used as the home venue for the Bundesliga's Hertha BSC since 1963. In 1963, the Bundesliga was formed, and Hertha BSC participated by direct invitation, leaving its old stadium (the \"Plumpe\") to use the Olympiastadion. On 24 August, it played the first local match against 1. FC Nürnberg, with the final score 1–1.\nHowever, in 1965, the German Football Association found Hertha BSC guilty of bribery and relegated them to the Regional Leagues.\n\nIn 1968, Hertha returned to the first division, and to the Olympiastadion, and in 1971 sold \"Plumpe\". The second half of the 1970s was quite successful for Hertha BSC Berlin. In 1979, it reached the semifinals of the UEFA Cup, but was defeated by Red Star Belgrade. Hertha reached the finals of the German Cup twice (1977 and 1979). In the 1980s, Hertha had a declining role in the Bundesliga, and fell to the Regional Leagues in 1986, although they later recovered reaching the Second Division (1988–1989).\n\nWith the demolition of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, a spontaneous feeling of sympathy between Hertha and 1. FC Union Berlin from Eastern Berlin arose, which culminated in a friendly match at the Olympiastadion with 50,000 spectators (27 January 1990). In 1990, Hertha returned to the First Division, although it fell again to the Second Division from 1991 until 1997.\nSince 1997, the club has improved, climbing up the Bundesliga table and qualifying for the UEFA Champions League, with matches against top European teams like Chelsea and A.C. Milan.\n\nThe Olympiastadion held the world record for the attendance of a baseball game during the 1936 Olympics thought to be over 100,000.\n\nSince 1985, the stadium has hosted the finals of both the DFB-Pokal and its companion women's tournament, the Frauen DFB Pokal. However, it did not host the 2010 final of the Frauen DFB Pokal, which was held at Cologne's RheinEnergieStadion as part of an experimental test to host the event in a different city.\n\nThe stadium hosted five American Bowls between 1990-1994. The stadium was also home to Berlin Thunder, an American football team in NFL Europa, from 2003 until the league's operator, the U.S. National Football League, closed down the money-losing competition in 2007.\n\nThe stadium also hosted The World Culture Festival. 2011 was to celebrate 30 years of service to humanity by Art of Living Foundation.\n\nThe stadium also hosts the Internationales Stadionfest, which also served as an IAAF Golden League event until 2010. The future of the event is currently unknown.\n\nThe stadium hosted the 2009 World Championships in Athletics where Usain Bolt broke the 100 metres and 200 metres world records.\n\nOn 1 August 1936, the Olympics were officially inaugurated by the head of state Adolf Hitler, and the Olympic cauldron was lit by athlete Fritz Schilgen. Four million tickets were sold for all the events of the 1936 Summer Olympics. This was also the first Olympics with television transmission (25 viewing spaces were scattered all over Berlin and Potsdam) and radio transmissions in 28 languages (with 20 radio vans and 300 microphones).\n\nWhile the Olympic flame had been used for the first time in Amsterdam 1928, in Berlin 1936 a marathon-like tour of the Olympic torch was introduced, from Olympia in Greece, crossing six frontiers with a journey of to Berlin, through Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Austria and Germany. The original idea of this Olympic torch relay was Carl Diem's, who was a political advisor to Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, specialising in Olympic affairs. The Olympics were the subject of the propaganda film \"Olympia\" (1938) by Leni Riefenstahl.\n\nAmong the sport competitions, one of the most memorable events was the performance of the African-American track and field athlete Jesse Owens, representing the United States of America. Owens won the gold medal in the 100, 200, long jump and 4 x 100 relay. One of the main streets outside the stadium is named Jesse Owens Allee in recognition of his performance. The stadium also hosted the equestrian jumping, football, and handball events.\n\nThree matches from Group A (West Germany, Chile, East Germany and Australia) were played in the Olympiastadion. The third match, Australia vs Chile, was played in torrential rain. The historic match between the two German teams, however, was played in Hamburg. The hosts, West Germany, won the tournament.\n\nThe following matches were played in Berlin, for the 2006 FIFA World Cup:\n\nIn 2011, the Olympiastadion hosted Germany's opening match in the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. It was the only match in the tournament to be contested at the stadium.\n\nIn May 2013, the Olympiastadion was chosen as the venue for the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final. FC Barcelona won their fifth title and completed a second treble.\n\nThe stadium was used as a location scene in the cinematic cold-war spy drama \"The Quiller Memorandum\" (1966).\n\nThe underground train (U-Bahn) U2 takes visitors directly to the station Olympiastadion. It's a short walk from there to the stadium (East Gate entrance: 500m, South Gate entrance: 870m). Average travel time: 14 minutes from Zoologischer Garten, 24 minutes from Potsdamer Platz, 34 minutes from Alexanderplatz.\n\nThe regional train (S-Bahn) S5 takes visitors directly to the station Olympiastadion. It's a short walk from there to the stadium (South Gate entrance via exit Flatowallee: 200 m, East Gate entrance via exit Trakehner Allee: 250m). Average travel time: 7 minutes from Spandau station, 14 minutes from Zoologischer Garten, 22 minutes from Friedrichstrasse, 26 minutes from Alexanderplatz.\n\nWith the bus lines M49 and 218 visitors can reach the stop Flatowallee. It's a short walk from there to the stadium. With the bus line 104 visitors can reach the underground station Neu-Westend. From there its a walk directly to the stadium.

It is also a venue for football, primarily at the high school level. \n\nThe original stadium opened in 1926 with a capacity of 17,000. The stadium featured an upper-deck on top of the grandstand. The Greater Johnstown High School football team regularly sold out the Point for their rivalry games against Windber High School and Altoona Area High School. The upper grandstand was later removed and capacity was reduced to 10,000. It was the home of numerous minor-league baseball teams and the All-American Amateur Baseball Association (AAABA) World Series baseball tournament. \n\nThe original Point Stadium had unusual field dimensions: fitted into a rectangular city block next to the Conemaugh River, it was just down the right-field line and down the left-field line, but bulged out to over feet in center field, depending on the location of a snow fence which cut off the farthest reaches of the stadium in right center field. Huge nets were put in left field to keep balls in play, preventing easy home runs, and also to prevent balls from reaching the adjacent street.\n\n\nAfter nearly eight decades, the original structure was torn down in 2005 to make room for an $8 million renovation.

Its West and East courses are respectively ranked number 1 and 6 in Australia. The West course is ranked in the top-five courses in the world. Founded in 1891, it is Australia's oldest extant and continually existing golf club. The Royal Melbourne Golf Club has a capacity for 15,000 spectators.\n\nRoyal Melbourne has hosted numerous national and international events. Its 16 Australian Opens are surpassed by only the 17 hosted by The Australian Golf Club. It hosted the 1959 Canada Cup (now Mission Hills World Cup), and the 1972 World Cup. Royal Melbourne hosted the Bicentennial Classic, a tournament to celebrate the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. It was selected by the PGA Tour to hold the Presidents Cup, for the first time outside the United States, in December 1998. The match was convincingly won by the International team, captained by Peter Thomson, an honorary member of Royal Melbourne. The course hosted the Presidents Cup again in November 2011, won by the United States. It was the site of the Women's Australian Open for the first time in February 2012, now an LPGA Tour event, and it returned three years later in 2015.\n\nFounded in 1891 as the Melbourne Golf Club ('Royal' prefix given in 1895), the founding president was Sir James McBain, and the founding captain was John Munro Bruce (father of the later Australian prime minister, Viscount Stanley Melbourne Bruce). The principal founding members included P.K. (Patrick Kinney) McCaughan, a New Zealand pastoralist, parliamentarian, businessman and developer and proprietor of the Old Rialto Hotel building in Collins Street.\n\nThe club had to give up its original site, much nearer the city centre, because of increasing urbanization. It planned a move to its present location in the mid-1920s. Royal Melbourne's two current courses are known as the 'West' and 'East' courses. The West course was designed under the strict standards of famous course architect Alister MacKenzie. He visited the eventual site, located on the renowned Melbourne Sandbelt, south of the city, in 1926. The actual building of the West course was overseen by the famed Australian golfer Alex Russell, as well as the head greenkeeper Mick Morcom; it was completed for play in 1931. The East course was designed by Russell, and was completed in 1932.\n\nA combination of 18 holes from the East and West courses contained on the main property is known as the 'Composite' course. There have been 21 holes used in the history of the 'Composite' course, from 1959 to 2011, depending on the event being held.\n\nThe East course is the lesser of the courses with fewer noteworthy holes, but is still held in very high regard. The West course has several world-class holes but they are not long compared to current standards for championship par 4s and 5s. The course is strictly landlocked by existing boundaries. During recent restoration of the West course (and East course Composite holes) in preparation for the 2011 Presidents Cup, fairway grasses were changed to restrict the progress of the golf ball, particularly given the lack of length of the par 5 holes.\n\n"}

Milan and Inter Milan. It has a seating capacity of 80,018, making it one of the largest stadiums in Europe, and the largest in Italy.\n\nOn 3 March 1980, the stadium was named in honour of Giuseppe Meazza, the two-time World Cup winner (1934, 1938) who played for Inter and briefly for Milan in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe San Siro is a UEFA category four stadium. It hosted six games at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and four European Cup finals, in 1965, 1970, 2001 and 2016. If the city of Milan bid with Cortina d'Ampezzo, Val di Fiemme and Valtellina is successful for the 2026 Winter Olympics this stadium would host the Opening and Closing ceremonies, being the largest stadium to do this, narrowly beating Beijing National Stadium if 2022 ceremonies aren't fully sold-out events.\n\nConstruction of the stadium commenced in 1925 in the district of Milan named San Siro, with the new stadium originally named Nuovo Stadio Calcistico San Siro (San Siro New Football Stadium). The idea to build a stadium in the same district as the horse racing track belonged to the president of A.C. Milan at the time, Piero Pirelli. The architects designed a private stadium only for football, without athletics tracks which characterized Italian stadiums built with public funds. The inauguration was on 19 September 1926, when 35,000 spectators saw Inter defeat Milan 6–3. Originally, the ground was home and property of A.C. Milan. Finally, in 1947, Inter, who used to play in the Arena Civica downtown, became tenants and the two have shared the ground ever since.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1955, engineers Armando Ronca and Ferruccio Calzolari developed the project for the second extension of the stadium, which was meant to increase the capacity from 50,000 to 150,000 visitors. Calzolari and Ronca proposed three additional, vertically arranged, rings of spectator rows. Nineteen spiralling ramps – each 200 metres long – gave access to the upper tiers. During construction, the realisation of the highest of the three rings was abandoned and the number of visitors limited to 100,000.\n\nOn 2 March 1980 the stadium was named for Giuseppe Meazza (1910–1979), one of the most famous Milanese footballers.\n\nTwo Milan derby Champions League knockout ties have taken place at San Siro, in 2003 and 2005, with A.C. Milan winning both matches. The reaction of Inter's fans to impending defeat in the latter match (throwing flares and other objects at Milan players and forcing the match to be abandoned) earned the club a large fine and a four-game ban on spectators attending European fixtures there the following season.\n\nApart from being used by Milan and Inter, the Italian national team occasionally plays games there. It has also been used for the European Cup finals of 1965 (won by Inter), 1970 (won by Feyenoord), and the UEFA Champions League finals of 2001 (won by FC Bayern Munich) and 2016 (won by Real Madrid).\n\nThe stadium was also used for the home leg of three UEFA Cup finals in which Inter was competing (1991, 1994, 1997) when these were played over two legs. It was also used by Juventus for their 'home' leg in 1995 as they decided against playing their biggest matches at their own Stadio delle Alpi at the time. On each occasion, apart from 1991, the second leg was played at San Siro and the winners lifted the trophy there. However, the stadium has not yet been selected as the host stadium since the competition changed to a single-match final format in 1997–98.\n\nSan Siro did not host any final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, but was the host stadium for the 1951 Latin Cup, a four-team event won by A.C. Milan. The city was also the venue for the 1956 edition of the Latin Cup (also won by Milan), but those matches were played at Arena Civica.\n\nThe stadium underwent further renovations for the 1990 World Cup with $60 million being spent, bringing the stadium up to UEFA category four standard. As part of the renovations, the stadium became all seated, with an extra tier being added to three sides of the stadium. This entailed the building of 11 concrete towers around the outside of the stadium. Four of these concrete towers were located at the corners to support a new roof, which has distinctive protruding red girders.\n\nIn 1996 a museum was opened inside the stadium charting A.C. Milan and Inter's story, with historical shirts, cups and trophies, shoes, art objects and souvenirs of all kinds on display to visitors.\n\nThe stadium was one of the biggest venues of the 1934 FIFA World Cup and held three matches.\nThe stadium was one of the four selected to host the matches during the UEFA Euro 1980.\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the 1990 FIFA World Cup and held six matches. \n\nSan Siro was the venue for the boxing match between Duilio Loi vs. Carlos Ortiz for the Junior Welterweight title in 1960.\n\nThe first and only top level rugby union match to be played at San Siro was a test match between Italy and New Zealand in November 2009. A crowd of 80,000 watched the event, a record for Italian rugby.\n\nBesides football, San Siro can be configured to hold many other events, particularly major concerts.\n\nThe stadium is located in the northwestern part of Milan and can be reached by underground via the dedicated San Siro metro station (at the end of the \"lilac\" line 5), located just in front of the stadium, or by tram, with line 16 ending right in front. The Lotto metro station (line 1, the \"red line\", and line 5) is about 15 minutes walk away from San Siro.\n\nStations near by:\n\n"}

{"id": "528152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=528152", "title": "Wingsuit flying", "text": "Wingsuit flying\n\nWingsuit flying (or wingsuiting) is the sport of flying through the air using a wingsuit which adds surface area to the human body to enable a significant increase in lift. The modern wingsuit, first developed in the late 1990s, creates a surface area with fabric between the legs and under the arms. Wingsuits are sometimes referred to as \"birdman suits\" (after the makers of the first commercially available wingsuit), \"flying squirrel suits\" (due to their resemblance to the animal), and \"bat suits\" (due to their resemblance to the animal or perhaps the superhero).\n\nA wingsuit flight normally ends by deploying a parachute, and so a wingsuit can be safely flown from any point that provides sufficient altitude for flight and parachute deployment—normally a skydiving drop aircraft, or BASE-jump exit point such as a tall cliff or a safe mountain top. The wingsuit flier wears parachute equipment specially designed for skydiving or BASE jumping. While the parachute flight is normal, the canopy pilot typically unzips arm wings (after deployment) to be able to reach the steering parachute toggles and control the descent path.\n\nAn early attempt at wingsuit flying was made on 4 February 1912 by a 33-year-old tailor, Franz Reichelt, who jumped from the Eiffel Tower to test his invention of a combination of parachute and wing, which was similar to modern wingsuits. He misled the guards by saying that the experiment was going to be conducted with a dummy. He hesitated quite a long time before he jumped, and was killed when he hit the ground head first, opening a measurable hole in the frozen ground.\n\nA wingsuit was first used in the US in 1930 by a 19-year-old American, Rex Finney of Los Angeles, California, as an attempt to increase horizontal movement and maneuverability during a parachute jump. These early wingsuits were made of materials such as canvas, wood, silk, steel, and whalebone. They were not very reliable, although some \"birdmen\", notably Clem Sohn and Leo Valentin, claimed to have glided for miles.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the modern wingsuit was developed by Patrick de Gayardon of France, adapted from the model used by John Carta. In 1997, the Bulgarian Sammy Popov designed and built a wingsuit which had a larger wing between the legs and longer wings on the arms. His prototype was developed at Boulder City, Nevada. Testing was conducted in a vertical wind tunnel in Las Vegas at Flyaway Las Vegas. Popov's wingsuit first flew in October 1998 over Jean, Nevada, but it never went into commercial production. Popov's design was a great improvement in creating lift; it was able to slow the vertical speed to 30 km/h while gliding horizontally at speeds over 300 km/h (186 mph). In 1998, Chuck \"Da Kine\" Raggs built a version which incorporated hard ribs inside the wing airfoils. Although these more rigid wings were better able to keep their shape in flight, this made the wingsuit heavier and more difficult to fly. Raggs' design also never went into commercial production. Flying together for the first time, Popov and Raggs showcased their designs side-by-side at the World Free-fall Convention at Quincy, Illinois, in August 1999. Both designs performed well. At the same event, multiple-formation wingsuit skydives were made which included de Gayardon's, Popov's, and Raggs' suits.\nIn 1999, Jari Kuosma of Finland and Robert Pečnik of Croatia teamed up to create a wingsuit that was safe and accessible to all skydivers. Kuosma established Bird-Man International Ltd. the same year. BirdMan's \"Classic\", designed by Pečnik, was the first wingsuit offered to the general skydiving public. BirdMan was the first manufacturer to advocate the safe use of wingsuits by creating an instructor program. Created by Kuosma, the instructor program's aim was to remove the stigma that wingsuits were dangerous and to provide wingsuit beginners (generally, skydivers with a minimum of 200 jumps) with a way to safely enjoy what was once considered the most dangerous feat in the skydiving world. With the help of Birdman instructors Scott Campos, Chuck Blue and Kim Griffin, a standardized program of instruction was developed that prepared instructors. Wingsuit manufacturers Squirrel Wingsuits, TonySuits Wingsuits, Phoenix-Fly, Fly Your Body, and Nitro Rigging have also instituted coach training programs.\n\nDespite the training and regulation, wingsuit BASE jumping remains a precarious pastime. A 2012 University of Colorado study found that for Wingsuit BASE jumping there was approximately one severe injury for every 500 jumps undertaken.\n\nThe wingsuit flier enters free fall wearing both a wingsuit and parachute equipment. Exiting an aircraft in a wingsuit requires skilled techniques that differ depending on the location and size of the aircraft door. These techniques include the orientation relative to the aircraft and the airflow while exiting, and the way in which fliers spread their legs and arms at the proper time so as not to hit the aircraft or become unstable. The wingsuit immediately starts to fly upon exiting the aircraft in the relative wind generated by the forward speed of the aircraft. Exiting from a BASE jumping site, such as a cliff, or exiting from a helicopter, a paraglider, or a hot air balloon, is fundamentally different from exiting a moving aircraft, as the initial airspeed upon exit is absent. In these situations, a vertical drop using the forces of gravity to accelerate is required to generate the airspeed that wingsuits need to generate lift.\n\nAt a planned altitude above the ground in which a skydiver or BASE jumper typically deploys the parachute, wingsuit fliers will also deploy their parachutes. The parachute is flown to a controlled landing at the desired landing spot using typical skydiving or BASE jumping techniques.\n\nA wingsuit modifies the body area exposed to wind to increase the desired amount of lift with respect to drag generated by the body. With training, wingsuit pilots can achieve sustained glide ratio of 2.5:1 or more. This means that for every meter dropped, two and a half meters are gained moving forward. With body shape manipulation and by choosing the design characteristics of the wingsuit, fliers can alter both their forward speed and fall rate. The pilot manipulates these flight characteristics by changing the shape of the torso, de-arching and rolling the shoulders and moving hips and knees, and by changing the angle of attack in which the wingsuit flies in the relative wind, and by the amount of tension applied to the fabric wings of the suit. The absence of a vertical stabilizing surface results in little damping around the yaw axis, so poor flying technique can result in a spin that requires active effort on the part of the skydiver to stop.\n\nWingsuit pilots often use tools including portable GPS receivers to record their flight path. This data can be analyzed later to evaluate flight performance in terms of fall rate, speed, and glide ratio. When jumping for the first time at a new location, BASE jumpers will often evaluate terrain using maps and laser range finders. By comparing a known terrain profile with previously recorded flight data, jumpers can objectively evaluate whether a particular jump is possible.\nBASE jumpers also use landmarks, along with recorded video of their flight, to determine their performance relative to previous flights and the flights of other BASE jumpers at the same site.\n\nA typical skydiver's terminal velocity in belly to earth orientation ranges from 180–225 km/h (110 to 140 mph). A wingsuit can reduce these speeds dramatically. A vertical instantaneous velocity of 40 km/h (25 mph) has been recorded . However the speed at which the body advances forward through the air is still much higher (up to 100 km/h [62 mph]).\n\nThe tri-wing wingsuit has three individual ram-air wings attached under the arms and between the legs. The mono-wing wingsuit design incorporates the whole suit into one large wing.\nModern wingsuits use a combination of materials in order to create an airfoil shape. The main surface is typically made from ripstop nylon, with various materials used to reinforce the leading edge, and reduce drag.\n\nAs compared to skydiving from an airplane, BASE jumping involves jumping from a \"fixed object\" such as a cliff. BASE jumping in its modern form has existed since at least 1978, but it was not until 1997 that Patrick de Gayardon made some of the first ever wingsuit BASE jumps combining the two disciplines.\nCompared to normal BASE jumping, wingsuit BASE jumping allows pilots to fly far away from the cliffs they jumped from, and drastically increase their freefall time before deploying a parachute. Since 2003, many BASE jumpers have started using wingsuits, giving birth to wingsuit BASE.\n\nAs suit technology and pilot skill have improved, wingsuit BASE jumpers have learned to control their flight so well that they can fly just meters away from terrain. The practice of flying a wingsuit close to the faces and ridges of mountains is called proximity flying. By flying near terrain, wingsuit pilots feel a greater sense of speed due to having a close visual reference. Loic Jean-Albert of France is one of the first proximity flyers, and his pioneering flying brought many BASE jumpers into the sport. In November 2012, Alexander Polli became the first wingsuit BASE jumper to successfully strike a wingsuit target.\n\nWingsuit BASE jumping carries additional risk beyond a wingsuit skydive. Jumping from a fixed object means starting with low airspeed which requires different flying positions and skills. During the flight, hazards exists such as trees, rocks and the ground which must be avoided. While skydivers typically carry two parachutes, a main and a reserve, wingsuit BASE jumpers typically only carry one BASE-specific parachute.\n\nAnother variation on which studies are being focused is the wingpack, which consists of a strap-on rigid wing made of carbon fibre. It is a mix between a hang-glider and a wingsuit. The wingpack can reach a glide ratio of 6 and permits transportation of oxygen bottles and other material.\n\nOn 31 July 2003 the Austrian Felix Baumgartner, jumping from , successfully crossed the English Channel in 14 minutes using a wingpack, having covered over .\nAs of 2010, there have been experimental powered wingsuits, often using small jet engines strapped to the feet or a wingpack setup to allow for even greater horizontal speeds and even vertical ascent.\n\nOn 25 October 2005, in Lahti, Finland, Visa Parviainen jumped from a hot air balloon in a wingsuit with two small turbojet engines attached to his feet. The engines provided approximately 160 N (16 kgf, 35 lbf) of thrust each and ran on JET A-1 fuel. Parviainen achieved approximately 30 seconds of horizontal flight with no noticeable loss of altitude. Parviainen continued jumping from hot air balloons and helicopters, including one for the \"Stunt Junkies\" program on Discovery Channel.\n\nChristian Stadler from Germany invented the \"VegaV3 wingsuit system\" that uses an electronic adjustable hydrogen peroxide rocket. The rocket provides 1000 Newtons (100 kgf) of thrust and produces no flames or poisonous fumes. His first successful powered wingsuit jump was in 2007, when he reached horizontal speeds of over 255 km/h (160 mph).\n\nUsing a powered wingpack, Yves Rossy became the first person to attain the maneuverability and flight distances of an aircraft, moving only his body for steering; his experimental wingpack, however, is not commercially viable because the required construction materials are prohibitively expensive. He took an eight-minute flight over the Swiss Alps.\n\nFlying a wingsuit can add considerable complexity to a skydive. So, according to the Skydivers' Information Manual, the United States Parachute Association requires that any jumper have a minimum of 200 freefall skydives before completing a wingsuit first jump course and making a wingsuit jump. Requirements in other nations are similar. Wingsuit manufacturers offer training courses and certify instructors, and also impose the minimum jump numbers required before purchasing a wingsuit. Typically wingsuit pilots will start on a smaller wingsuit with less surface area. With practice, pilots can learn to fly larger suits with more surface area, which allow for increased glide and airtime.\n\nFédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the world governing airsports body, established judging criteria for official world record wingsuit formations in February 2015. The rules are available on the FAI website.\n\nPrior to this, the largest wingsuit formation recognized as meeting the criteria for a national record consisted of 68 wingsuit pilots, which set a U.S. national record at Lake Elsinore, California, on 12 November 2009. The largest global record was a diamond formation involving 100 wingsuit pilots at Perris, California, on 22 September 2012. These records have since been retired as they do not meet the current rules.\n\nTwo World Records have been set since the rules update. A 42-person formation over Moorsele, Belgium, set an FAI record on 18 June 2015. This was broken on 17 October 2015, when 61 wingsuit pilots set the current FAI world record over Perris Valley Airport near Perris, California.\n\nThe current U.S. national record includes 43 wingsuit pilots. It was set on 5 October 2018 in Rosharon, Texas at Skydive Spaceland-Houston. \n\nOn 23 May 2006, the Australian couple Heather Swan and Glenn Singleman jumped from off Meru Peak in India, setting a world record for highest wingsuit BASE jump. This record was broken on 5 May 2013, by the Russian Valery Rozov, who jumped from on Mount Everest's North Col.\n\nThe longest verified wingsuit BASE jump is by the American Dean Potter on 2 November 2011. Potter jumped from the Eiger mountain and spent 3 minutes and 20 seconds in flight, descending of altitude.\n\nOn 22 May 2017, British wingsuit pilot Fraser Corsan set world records for the fastest speed reached in a wingsuit of .\n\nThe current world record for greatest average horizontal speed within the performance competition rules, i.e. within of vertical distance, was set on 23 October 2016, U.S. wingsuit pilot Joe Ridler set the world record for the fastest speed reached in a wingsuit of .\n\nOn 20 and 21 April 2012, Colombian skydiver Jhonathan Florez set Guinness World Records in wingsuit flying. The jumps took place in La Guajira in Colombia for the following records:\n\nThe current world record for longest time in flight within the performance competition rules, i.e. within of vertical distance, was set on 7 September 2014 by Canadian wingsuit pilot Marc-André Denault with a time of 98.9 seconds.\n\nOn 26 May 2012, the Japanese wingsuit pilot Shin Ito achieved two new world records: \"greatest horizontal distance flown in a wing suit\", and \"greatest absolute distance flown in a wing suit\", , both flights taking place above Yolo County, California, USA.\n\nThe current world record for longest horizontal distance covered within the performance competition rules, i.e. within of vertical distance, was set on 23 October 2016 by U.S. wingsuit pilot Alexey Galda with a distance of .\n\nOn 23 May 2012, British stuntman Gary Connery safely landed a wingsuit without deploying his parachute, landing on a crushable \"runway\" (landing zone) built with thousands of cardboard boxes.\n\nThe sport of Wingsuit flying is dangerous, and the pursuit of it has contributed to a number of notable fatalities since its inception. Some fail-safe concepts and developments, using technology from airbags or Aeronautics engineering, may reduce the death rate or prevent serious injury, but it would still be one of the most dangerous sports on earth.\n\nWingsuits were showcased in the 1969 film, \"The Gypsy Moths\", starring Burt Lancaster and Gene Hackman.\nIn \"\", a 2003 film, the character, Lara Croft, evades a group of henchmen by BASE jumping off of a partially finished skyscraper. The stunt was performed by the two men who developed the suits. No CGI, wires, nets, or other special effects were used.\n\nThe wingsuit is prominently featured in the game \"Just Cause 3\", as well as a powered version using the fictional mineral Bavarium.\n\nWingsuiting is one of the main features in \"Steep\". Players can switch to and operate a wingsuit at any time, and complete challenges for wingsuiting.\n\nIn \"YOLO\", an episode of \"The Simpsons\", Homer and his childhood pen pal Eduardo go skydiving in wingsuits so he can fulfill his dream of flying like his hero, Rocky the Flying Squirrel.\n\nIn \"The Fate of the Furious\" powered wingsuits are used by Deckard and Owen Shaw to board Cipher's aircraft to rescue Dominic Toretto's kidnapped son.\n\nIn \"\" suits are used to get into Chicago during the Decepticons' invasion.\n\nSince the third entry, the wingsuit has become a staple of the \"Far Cry\" series.\n\nIn \"Batman\" comics, movies, and video games, the title character sometimes is portrayed as acting like a wingsuit, allowing him to glide over large distances.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6782394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6782394", "title": "Wrist roller", "text": "Wrist roller\n\nThe wrist roller is a device designed for strengthening the forearm muscles together in a rolling-pulling motion. It consists of a bar of varying lengths, with a cord or rope attached, which the user rolls and unrolls. This is resisted by the weight of a mass at the bottom of the cord. Rolled and unrolled, it has a concentric and eccentric proportion. Different forearm muscles, specifically the flexors and extensors can be targeted by rolling the bar in opposite directions; that is by having the rope either on your side or on the opposite one respectively. It can even be performed (with lighter weights) manipulated by the fingertips to develop dexterity.\n\nThe length of the rope determines the length of time one will take to vary between the concentric and eccentric portions (though it will always be the same length, if rolled and unrolled at the same pace). Strength is built by using a larger weight. The focus on gripping muscles versus wrist extensor muscles can be varied based upon the thickness of the bar. Speed and explosiveness is obtained by rolling at faster paces, easier with lighter weights.\n\nIn addition to the rolling, there is also a function of wrist and shoulder supination inherent in the exercise, as one hand will hold and twist the weight, keeping the other side level, while the other lets go as to let it rotate and shift the grip. This is more apparent with heavier weights. Normally held in front of the body, this focus can be somewhat altered by the height/angle the bar is held at. A posture in which the arms are held in front of the pelvis is preferred as this reduces the weight borne by the shoulders and reduces the tendency for the elbow muscles to take up some of the work. This does however effectively shorten the length of rope or cord, so one may wish to stand on a raised platform of some sort if a more prolonged \"rep\" is desired. This can be reversed by holding it behind the body from below or above, allowing a different focus of muscles as well as a prolonged stretch for flexibility and endurance. It can be done at home also by tying a rope to a rod and attach it to weight like dumbbell or water buckets (with water filled as per your strength and ability).\n\n"}
