{"id": "166394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166394", "title": "Aerobics", "text": "Aerobics\n\nAerobics is a form of physical exercise that combines rhythmic aerobic exercise with stretching and strength training routines with the goal of improving all elements of fitness (flexibility, muscular strength, and cardio-vascular fitness). It is usually performed to music and may be practiced in a group setting led by an instructor (fitness professional), although it can be done solo and without musical accompaniment. With the goal of preventing illness and promoting physical fitness, practitioners perform various routines comprising a number of different dance-like exercises. Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity and complexity. A well-balanced aerobics class will have five components: warm-up (5–10 minutes), cardio vascular conditioning (25–30 minutes), muscular strength and conditioning (10–15 minutes), cool-down (5–8 minutes) and stretching and flexibility (5–8 minutes). Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation according to their fitness level. Many gyms offer a variety of aerobic classes. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a certified instructor with a specialty area related to their particular class.\n\nBoth the term and the specific exercise method were developed by Dr Kenneth H. Cooper, an exercise physiologist, and Col. Pauline Potts, a physical therapist, both of the United States Air Force. Cooper, an exercise enthusiast, was puzzled about why some people with good muscular strength were prone to perform poorly at activities such as long-distance running, swimming, and bicycling. He began using a bicycle ergometer to measure sustained performance in terms of a person's ability to use oxygen. In 1968, he published \"Aerobics\", which included exercise programs using running, walking, swimming and bicycling. At the time the book was published there was increasing awareness of the need for increased exercise due to widespread weakness and inactivity. Cooper published a mass-market version \"The New Aerobics\" in 1979.\n\nAerobics gained worldwide popularity after the release of Jane Fonda's exercise videos in 1982.\n\nStep aerobics is a form of aerobic exercise that uses a low elevated platform, the step, of height tailored to individual needs by inserting risers. Step aerobics classes are offered at many gyms.\n\nStep aerobics was developed by Gin Miller around 1989. After a knee injury, Miller consulted with an orthopedic doctor, who recommended she strengthen the muscles supporting the knee by stepping up and down on a milk crate; from this she developed the step regimen.\n\nStep aerobics can also be involved in dancing games, such as \"Dance Dance Revolution\" or \"In the Groove\".\n\nOften moves are referred to as Reebok step moves in reference to one of the first makers of the plastic step commonly used in gyms.\n\nThe \"basic\" step involves raising one foot onto the step, then the other so that they are both on the step, then stepping the first foot back, followed by the second. A \"right basic\" would involve stepping right foot up, then the left, then returning to the floor alternating right then left.\n\nSome instructors switch immediately between different moves, for example between a right basic and a left basic without any intervening moves, effectively \"tapping\" the foot without shifting weight; tap-free or smooth stepping alternates the feet without \"taps\"\nCommon moves include:\n\n\nMany instructors will prepare a set of moves that will be executed together to form the choreography of the class. Usually, the choreography will be timed to 32 beats in a set, ideally switching legs so that the set can be repeated in a mirrored fashion. A set may consist of many different moves and the different moves may have different durations. For example, a basic step as described above takes 4 beats (for the 4 steps the person takes). Similarly, the \"knee up\" move also takes 4 beats. Another common move, the repeater knee, is an 8-beat move.\n\nClasses vary in the level of choreography. Basic level classes will tend to have a series of relatively basic moves strung together into a sequence. More advanced classes incorporate dance elements such as turns, mambos, and stomps. These elements are put together into 2–3 routines in each class. One learns the routines during the class and then all are performed at the end of the class. Regardless of the complexity of the choreography, most instructors offer various options for different levels of intensity/dance ability while teaching the routines.\n\nFreestyle aerobics is an aerobics style in which a group instructor choreographs several short dance combinations and teaches them to the class. This is usually achieved by teaching the class 1-2 movements at a time and repeating the movements until the class is able to join the whole choreography together. Aerobic music is used throughout the class. This is sometimes followed by a strength section which uses body weight exercises to strengthen muscles and a stretch routine to cool down and improve flexibility. Classes are usually 30–60 minutes in length and may include the use of equipment such as a barbell, aerobic step, or small weights.\n\nIn freestyle aerobics, the instructor choreographs the routine and adjusts it to the needs and wants of her/his class. There is often no difference between base movements in freestyle and pre-choreographed programs.\n\nIt is practiced to improve aerobic fitness, flexibility and strength.\n\nAerobic gymnastics, also known as sport aerobics and competitive aerobics, may combine complicated choreography, rhythmic and acrobatic gymnastics with elements of aerobics. Performance is divided into categories by age, sex and groups (individual, mixed pairs and trios) and are judged on the following elements: dynamic and static strength, jumps and leaps, kicks, balance and flexibility. Ten exercises are mandatory: four consecutive high leg kicks, patterns. A maximum of ten elements from following families are allowed: push-ups, supports and balances, kicks and splits, jumps and leaps. Elements of tumbling such as handsprings, handstands, back flips, and aerial somersaults are prohibited. Scoring is by judging of artistic quality, creativity, execution, and difficulty of routines. Sport aerobics has state, national, and international competitions, but is not an olympic sport.\n\nLike other forms of exercise, step aerobics helps burn calories and fat. The number of calories burned depends on the speed of movements, step height, length of exercise, and the persons height and weight.\n\n"}

Established in 1948 as ATK Praha, the club won a total of 11 Czechoslovak league titles and eight Czechoslovak Cups, and in the 1966–67 season, reached the semi-finals of the European Cup. As late as 1985–86 they reached the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup semi-final and they also made a great impact in the American Challenge Cup competition in New York City with four wins between 1961 and 1964. The club sent seven players to the silver medal winning Czechoslovakia national team in the 1962 World Cup, in a year which saw them win the fifth of their domestic league titles as well as their player Josef Masopust be named European Footballer of the Year. Between the start of the competition in 1955 and 1991, Dukla played more matches in the European Cup than any other team in Czechoslovakia.\n\nDukla Prague football club was connected to clubs of other sports, but this connection continues no longer. Separate athletics, rowing, handball, modern pentathlon, cycling etc. clubs named Dukla Praha however still nurture world class athletes in their respective sports (like Roman Šebrle and others). In contrast to the football clubs, these are still under patronage of the Czech Army.\n\nDukla Prague was formed in 1948 as (ATK) Praha and started life in the top division of Czechoslovak football. The Dukla organisation, as it later became known, was run by the Czechoslovak Army and included seven sports teams. The club changed its name to (ÚDA) Praha in 1953, winning the first of eleven league titles in the 1953 season. The club went on to win the 1956 league title, changing their name to the same year in honour of those had fallen at the Battle of Dukla Pass in 1944. The subsequent 1957–58 season brought the club a second consecutive league title for the club and their third overall.\n\nThe 1960–61 season marked the inaugural season of the Czechoslovak Cup. That season, Dukla completed a \"double\" as they defeated Dynamo Žilina in the cup final to add to their fourth league title. The club was on the verge of another double in 1962, winning the league but losing in the cup final to Slovan Bratislava. 1962 was also a World Cup year. Dukla were represented by seven players on the Czechoslovakia national football team, which reached the final before losing to Brazil. Dukla star Josef Masopust scored in the final as Brazil won 3–1 and was later named as the winner of the 1962 Ballon d'Or. Dukla spent the next two seasons winning the league again, making a total of four titles in a row. The 1964–65 season yielded just the Cup before Dukla completed their second double in 1965–66. The club's final trophy of the decade came in the 1968–69 cup. In the first nine seasons of the cup competition, therefore, Dukla had reached six finals and won four titles.\n\nThe competition's format changed after the 1968–69 season, and it was not until 1980–81 that Dukla would record another title in the competition, repeating the achievement in 1982–83, 1984–85 and 1989–90. In the 1985–86 season, the club recorded its record win, a 10–0 victory against Dynamo České Budějovice.\n\nBetween the start of the competition in 1955 and 1991, Dukla played more matches in the European Cup (45) than any other team in Czechoslovakia. The five players from the Czechoslovak league with the most appearances in the competition in the pre-Champions League era of the European Cup all represented Dukla in the competition, these being Josef Masopust, Jozef Adamec, Jiří Čadek, Josef Vacenovský and Dušan Kabát.\n\nCzech writer and sports journalist Ota Pavel wrote a unique book about Dukla's first victory in the American Challenge Cup and named it \"Dukla mezi mrakodrapy\" ().\n\nThe supremacy of Dukla was so undisputed the organizers decided to establish the American Challenge Cup as the final of next International Soccer League editions, in which Dukla was invited to play against the winners of the group stage. Dukla won three American Challenge Cups, over Brazil's America-RJ in 1962 (1–1 and 2–1), over West Ham United in 1963 (1–0 and 1–1) and over Zagłębie Sosnowiec in 1964 (3–1 and 1–1). In later years they struggled to maintain international recognition, however they were well known to British fans thanks to Half Man Half Biscuit's cult song: \"All I want for Christmas is a Dukla Prague away kit\" which was the B-side of their 1986 single \"The Trumpton Riots\" and was subsequently issued on the album Back Again in the DHSS and then on the CD release of the album Back in the DHSS. Fans of the band have created considerable demand for replica Dukla Prague shirts and made the team a favourite among hipster football fans.\n\nDukla's overall record in the International Soccer League and the American Challenge Cup thus comprises 11 wins, four draws and one loss with a score of 49–19.\n\n1994 saw the club's long-running association with the military come to an end and at the same time its status as a top-division team was lost. Dukla finished last in the 1993–94 Czech First League, employing three different managers over the course of the season. In a season which saw the club lose 7–0 to Viktoria Žižkov, Dukla won just one of their thirty matches, a 1–0 victory against Hradec Králové. Dukla played the following 1994–95 season in the third-tier Bohemian Football League, finishing in third place behind SK Chrudim and Pelikán Děčín. Dukla was unable to win the league in the 1995–96 season either, again finishing third, this time behind Atlantic Lázně Bohdaneč and Česká Lípa.\n\nThe club then merged with second division side FC Portál Příbram in 1996. The new club, which later became known as 1. FK Příbram, played one season in Prague at Juliska before moving to Příbram in 1997, the last home match at Juliska being a 2–2 draw with relegated Baník Havířov on 1 June 1997.\n\nThe name of Dukla Prague disappeared from the Czech football for several years, but not forever. Dukla Dejvice, a local Prague team founded in 1959, began playing at Juliska stadium and adopted Dukla Prague's yellow and red colours.\n\nThe club entered the Prague Championship in 2001. In November 2006, Dukla Prague management announced that it had agreed to take over the second league rights of the Jakubčovice team. The legendary club returned to the Czech top league in 2011.\n\nThe following individuals managed Dukla. In the 1948 season there were joint managers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

An expansion, \"EA Sports Active: More Workouts\", was released on November 17, 2009.\n\nA follow-up, EA Sports Active 2, released in November 2010. An NFL-themed version, EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp, was released on the same day.\n\n\"EA Sports Active\" is an exercise game consisting of activities that use the motion controls of the Wii platform. Primarily played using the Wii Remote, the game package includes a pouch that allows the player to strap the attached Nunchuk to their legs in order to track their lower body movements. The Wii Balance Board is also supported but is not required for play.\n\nThe game features a number of exercise options supervised by a virtual personal trainer including 20 minute workout regimens and a 30 Day Challenge mode that lets players set workout goals such as calories burned or a number of sessions while tracking their progress over time. The idea is that the weight loss will happen on its own if the calories burned goals in each workout are met or exceeded.\n\nThe game also awards trophies for reaching specific fitness landmarks such as accumulating 10 total workout hours, working out with a friend, and completing all the exercises in the 30 Day Challenge.\n\nPlayers are also encouraged to create a custom workout session built around either personal favorite exercises, calorie goals (such as burning 100+ calories in one session), or targeting specific body areas. To help aid in creating a balanced workout, a percentage chart displays how much of the routine is devoted to either upper body, lower body, or cardio development. The intensity of the workout can be altered by changing the difficulty levels of either a single exercise or the entire routine.\n\nEA Sports' Peter Moore claims that \"EA Sports Active\" was developed to focus more on a higher-impact \"Western\" philosophy of exercise focused mainly on weight loss, compared to a lower-impact, stretching and balance based \"Eastern\" approach as taken by Nintendo's \"Wii Fit\". EA also saw a strong business opportunity in creating a game for people who need to work out yet do not have the time or are not comfortable doing so in public.\n\nCelebrity personal trainer Bob Greene was involved with developing the game.\n\n\"EA Sports Active\" has received generally positive reviews from video game critics and mainstream media.\n\nOne of the biggest critiques on EA's community message boards about the game was the lack of real resistance offered by the supplied elastic band. Many found that folding the band over itself as suggested by the game’s tutorial to be ineffective in increasing the resistance level. However, the supplied grips for the elastic band can be used with other elastic bands, specifically those used in pilates, in order to increase the intensity of all upper body exercises.\n\nEA claims that \"EA Sports Active\" has sold over 600,000 units worldwide between May 19, 2009 and June 1, 2009, and 1.8 million units in its quarter. It is EA's best selling Wii title.\n\nThe lack of an option to switch to left-handed has caused discontent for some left-handed users who have purchased the game as this is not advertised on the outer packaging.\n\nAfter the success the game received, EA Sports released an expansion pack on 17 November 2009, titled EA Sports Active: More Workouts, which as the name suggests added several new workouts to the existing program.\n\n"}

Snowmobilers are the recreation group most likely to be killed in an avalanche, largely due to the activity of highmarking.\n\nAccording to the Utah Avalanche Forecast Center, \"Avalanche victims are almost exclusively backcountry recreationists--snowmobilers, climbers, snowboarders, snowshoers, skiers and hikers. Snowmobilers lead the list with twice the number of fatalities as any other activity.\"\nHighmarking is the recreational maneuver of attempting to reach the highest point of a snow-covered feature such as a mountain, on a snowmobile. It refers to a specific activity in which the snowmobile operator's main goal is to accelerate and gain maximum elevation upon the face of a mountain before the machine reaches the top of the feature or upward progress is suddenly forced to diminish because of the grade of the feature, which gives the rider no choice but to turn around.\n\nA High mark begins when a snowmobiler leaves an established trail and fully accelerates; blazing his/her own trail upward toward the summit of a snow-covered mountain face, ideally lying at a 30-45% grade. As the terrain gets steeper, the machine's acceleration slows down. At the apex of the elevation gained, the rider must sharply turn 180 degrees and descend the feature. The height of the arching track left in the snow by a pioneering rider usually sparks competition within members of a rider's party, urging the rest to surpass the height of the original arch, thus initiating a competition. High marks vary in their degrees of difficulty depending on the pitch of a given ascent and conditions of the snow.\n\nHighmarking involves serious personal injury risk factors, most notably the danger of the rider triggering an avalanche and becoming buried in the ensuing cataclysm. According to , \"Highmarking accounts for more than 63 percent of the avalanche fatalities involving snowmobilers in North America.\" Highmarking should only be attempted by snowmobilers who are equipped with avalanche transceivers and accompanied by other riders capable of detecting a distress signal and rescuing a buried snowmobiler.\n\n"}

Ladies Professional Golf Association\n\nJane Blalock v. Ladies Professional Golf Association was an ongoing lawsuit that took place between 1972 and 1975, following a professional golf incident in 1972. A month after winning the notable Dinah Shore Colgate Winner's Circle in 1972, American golfer Jane Blalock was allegedly observed replacing her marker incorrectly at the Bluegrass Invitational during the 1972 LPGA Tour. Blalock was fined and suspended by the LPGA Tour executive board. The suspension led to a fair degree of press coverage, with Blalock filing an anti-trust countersuit in United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia shortly afterwards.\n\nIn June 1973, federal judge Charles A. Moye Jr. ruled that \"LGPA players cannot police their own members,\" and that Blalock's suspension \"was ill-founded.\" A court awarded Blalock damages the following year. The LPGA subsequently announced plans to appeal. The ongoing lawsuit led to the LPGA searching for its first commissioner, and after Ray Volpe was appointed to the role in July 1975, a month later the LPGA dropped its appeal and settled all claims on the Blalock case.\n\nJane Blalock was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on September 19, 1945. She began golfing at age 13, and won the New Hampshire Amateur five straight times beginning in 1965, plus the New England Amateur in 1968. Blalock attended Rollins College in Florida, graduating in 1967 with a degree in history. Prior to her playing the LPGA Tour, Blalock worked as a high school history teacher.\n\nThe first time Blalock played on the LPGA Tour was as an amateur at the 1964 Lady Carling Eastern Open. She finished T33.\n\nStill an amateur, Blalock finished 5th at the 1969 Burdine's Invitational.\n\nBlalock turned pro later in 1969 and went on to earn LPGA Tour Rookie of the Year honors. In 1970, Blalock notched her first professional victory at the Lady Carling Open. On April 16, 1972, Blalock won the inaugural version of the Dinah Shore Colgate Winner's Circle, an event which would later be considered a women's major golf championship. One month later she won the Suzuki Golf Internationale, beating Kathy Whitworth.\n\nAfter reaching the status of \"top money winner on this year's [LPGA] tour,\" Blalock was competing in the Bluegrass Invitational in Louisville, Kentucky by mid May 1972. After the second round the LPGA executive board called Blalock in to tell her she was disqualified from the tournament, contending that she signed an incorrect scorecard and also levying a $500 fine. Although Blalock's scorecards had been signed and attested by fellow competitors, Tourney director Gene Mcauliff stated that Blalock \"did not mark her ball properly on the 17th green and then failed to take a two-stroke penalty as required for that infraction.\"\n\nAll five members of the executive committee, Linda Craft, Sharon Miller, Judy Rankin, Cynthia Sullivan, and Penny Zavichas, were themselves active players. After Blalock's initial interaction with the committee at the Bluegrass Invitational, 27 LPGA players signed an affidavit demanding \"that more severe action be taken against Jane Blalock,\" specifically arguing that probation, a fine, and disqualification from the Bluegrass tournament were not enough punishment.\n\nOn May 20, 1972 the LPGA executive board suspended Blalock for one year \"for actions inconsistent with the code of ethics of the organization.\" The suspension came shortly after the announcement that Blalock wouldn't be allowed to compete in the Lady Carling Open. The tour also put a hold on her money earnings from the tour, at the time around $50,000.\n\nIn defending their reasons for the suspension, the board stated in a press release that \"the action was taken after Miss Blalock met with the executive committee on three occasions in the last 10 days. She admitted actions on the golf course which are contrary to the rules of the game.\" According to \"Sports Illustrated,\" the board also claimed that Blalock had \"been under suspicion for over a year, that there [had] been repeated violations, that witnesses in the gallery at Louisville had observed her replacing the ball to the side of her marker on the green and that Janie tearfully admitted to her guilt. Miss Blalock was denying everything.\" LPGA executive director Bud Erickson also stated that he had requested Blalock to feign a back injury in an effort to avoid bad publicity, but she refused.\n\nOn June 1, 1972, Blalock filed a $5 million anti-trust countersuit against the LPGA's suspension on advice of her attorneys, with the intent of \"[leaving] it to the court whether she had been suspended wrongly.\" Blalock's lawyers motioned for her be allowed to continue playing while the suit was resolved. As part of their argument, Blalock's lawyers denied she had ever admitted guilt to the LPGA, and that the described admissions had been a misinterpretation of her words. Furthermore, using the sequence of events, attorney Eugene Partain \"alleged that the suspension and petitions were likely the result of other players attempting to remove a significant competitor, and that the act of suspending [Blalock] from playing in any significant tournaments was a violation of federal antitrust laws by the LPGA.\"\n\nAround June 19, Blalock met with the LGPA in U.S. District Court in Atlanta over the lawsuit. Later that month U.S. District Court Judge Charles A. Moye Jr. granted the motion for Blalock to continue competing in the LPGA Tour until the lawsuit was resolved, in effect creating a temporary restraining order against the suspension. Moye also ruled that any tour money Blalock earned during the case would be placed in a court trust. The LPGA reacted to Moye's rulings by announcing they would file an appeal suit.\n\nNews of the suspension and alleged rules violation drew significant press coverage, as well as mixed reactions from Blalock's colleagues. Though he said he'd never seen her move a ball against the rules himself, her former instructor Bob Toski stated that \"She has a compulsion to win. I think she needs psychiatric help\" and \"the other players tell me this has been going on for a while.\" In contrast, Blalock's caddie from the Suzuki tournament contacted her with an offer to testify in her support. Men's professional golfer Dave Hill, who himself filed an antitrust suit in 1971 against the PGA Tour, sent Blalock a note of encouragement. In his golf memoir \"Teed Off\", published in 1977, Hill wrote that he didn't know how Blalock continued to play well under the pressure she was enduring. The fact that Blalock did play well made Hill think she was innocent unless she was a victim of some illness.\n\nGolfer Sandra Palmer had also publicly defended Blalock as of July 8, 1972, after she and Blalock tied for lead at the George Washington Golf Classic. Stated Palmer to the press, \"I've never seen her do anything [illegal], nor do I think probably that very many of the players have. I think supposedly that out of all these players who accused, only one or two have played with her.\" Palmer explained she didn't understand why bystanders hadn't reported the alleged infractions when they occurred, also pointing out that other players had always signed Blalock's scorecards without reporting any incidents. Stated Palmer, \"if you see an infraction of the rules... you don't wait until three years later to report something. Once you've signed that card, you're as guilty as the person who committed the violation.\"\n\nThe \"Sarasota Journal\" reported on June 28, 1972 that Sandra Palmer had been \"warned\" by the LPGA over her statements of support for Blalock, with the LPGA explaining to Palmer that \"you're entitled to your own opinion, but when it hurts our members, we feel you owe the organization an apology.\" Bud Erickson, executive director of the LPGA, later clarified that Palmer was also ordered \"not to make any further statements of support for Miss Blalock.\" The warning occurred as the tour arrived at the Lady Pepsi Golf Tournament, where Blalock had previously won two championships. On August 2, 1972, Palmer was put on one year's probation by the LPGA executive committee for voicing her support of Blalock. Blalock went on to win two more times in 1972, at the Dallas Civitan Open and the Lady Errol Classic.\n\nAfter filing the original anti-trust suit, Blalock amended the suit to include only damages from not being able to compete in the Lady Carling Tournmanent in 1972 for $4,500.\n\nIn June 1973, Judge Charles Moye Jr. ruled that \"LGPA players cannot police their own members.\" The ruling declared that Blalock's suspension \"was ill-founded,\" with all remaining litigation to be focused on damages. In September 1973, \"The Telegraph\" reported that as a result of the court ruling in Blalock's favor, the LPGA and their new president Carol Mann were looking to appoint a commissioner to \"[enable] the association to penalize, suspend and fine members who violate rules and regulations.\"\n\nIn August 1974, a court awarded Blalock the full $4,500 she had asked for in damages, with the LPGA again announcing plans to appeal. Afterwards, in March 1975 Judge Charles Moye again ruled in Blalock's favor, awarding her $13,500 in damages and ordering the LPGA to pay her legal fees of $95,303. The LPGA again announced it would appeal the ruling in its entirety. Ray Volpe was appointed the first LPGA Commissioner on July 8, 1975, and a month later the LPGA announced it had dropped its appeal and settled \"all claims and counter claims growing from a dispute between it and golfer Jane Blalock.\"\n\nBlalock refused to condemn her critics, including her former mentor Bob Toski, after her lawsuit was settled. She said to a reporter in 1978 \"I should not judge others as they have judged me. Life is too short and there is too much sadness. So I can't clutter my mind with all that other stuff. It makes it hard to concentrate.\" Bob Toski left the Senior PGA Tour in 1986 after he became involved in a controversy over how he was marking his ball. Toski returned in April 1986 and played several more years on the Tour.\n\nBlalock continued playing on the LPGA Tour through 1987. When she was through playing, Blalock had 27 Tour wins to her credit. She was the first female golfer to earn over $100,000 in four consecutive years and the seventh overall to reach the one million dollar mark in career earnings. Between 1969 and 1980, Blalock made the cut in 299 consecutive tournaments, an all-time LPGA Tour record.\n\nIn 1976, Blalock testified for the LPGA Tour in a suit against a sponsor trying to start a Women's Masters Tournament. Blalock wrote a column for the \"Miami Herald\" in 1981 complaining about the association's overuse of sex appeal in promoting the tour.\n\nWith 27 LPGA Tour wins, Blalock almost qualified for the World Golf Hall of Fame under the standards in use as of 2011. However, she never won a major championship in her career nor was she ever LPGA Player of the Year or winner of the LPGA Vare Trophy. Blalock would have to be voted in by the Veterans Committee. As of 2018, all eligible golfers with 20 or more wins on the LPGA Tour are in the World Golf Hall of Fame except Blalock. Several golfers who primarily played the LPGA Tour, Hollis Stacy who was inducted in 2012, Judy Rankin and Donna Caponi have fewer career wins than Blalock but have been selected by the Veterans Committee. Blalock said in 2001 \"It's almost a relief that I don't qualify. What if every year my name came up and every year I didn't make it? I'd be thinking, 'is what happened the reason?'\"\n\nIn July 2014, she was voted into the Legends Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}

Around 1970 the track surface was converted to an asphalt and rubber surface, which was resurfaced in the 1980s.\n\nMcCulloch Stadium went through a major renovation in 1993. After renovations, the field was named Ted Ogdahl Field in honor of the former coach while the locker rooms were dedicated in the honor of Jeff Knox.

At that time university officials discovered the previous track was too long. In 2003 the grass field was removed and a new FieldTurf surface was installed at a cost of $500,000. Later that year lights were re-installed at McCulloch at a cost of $110,000. A new video scoreboard was added at the facility in 2007.\n\nThe stadium hosts a variety of sports. These include lacrosse, football, soccer, and track meets. McCulloch can seat 2,500 spectators. All seats at the stadium are in the covered grandstand on the west side of the playing surface. The grandstands include a press box, offices for the coaches, player locker rooms, and athletic training facilities.\n\nMcCulloch includes the eight lane Charles Bowles Track for the school's track teams. The stadium also host high school football games, including OSAA playoff games.\n\n"}

{"id": "1450847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1450847", "title": "Palla", "text": "Palla\n\nPalla (Italian for \"ball\") is a traditional Tuscan ball game played in villages between Siena and Grosseto. It is also called palla EH! (or pallaeh!) because players call out \"eh!\" before serving.\n\nSmall handmade balls contain a lead pellet wrapped in rubber and wool with a leather cover. The game is played by facing teams who strike (not catch) the ball with either a bare or gloved hand. Courts are marked out with painted lines on town streets, but there is no net, and players can move between sides. Adjacent buildings, objects, and sometimes spectators, are considered \"in play.\" Play does stop for oncoming automobiles. Similar to real tennis, a second bounce can result in a \"chase\" rather than an outright point, marked in chalk where the ball stops rolling.\n\nScoring is identical to that of tennis (15-30-40-game). In the variant called pallaventuno (or palla 21) each game counts as 7, and a set is won with three games (7 for the first, 14 for the second, and 21 for the third, hence the name given to the game). In the other variant, games are simply counted in progression (game 1, game 2). Pallacorda (or palla della corda) is an extinct form of the game where a cord was strung across the street. Pisa, Prato, Rome, Siena, and various Tuscan towns still have streets named \"via Pallacorda\" or \"via Della Corda\".\n\nPalla is of interest to those who study the history of tennis, as it provides some insight into the development of the more contemporarily popular sport. Given the similarities of scoring and the use of chases, it is highly likely palla and tennis share a common sporting ancestor, the various games of palla being more primal in form.\n\nThe fact that real tennis was originally played without racquets is\nwell documented. The name of the sport in French is\njeu de paume, or \"game of the palm\" (of the hand). However, the development of the net is documented less well. In real tennis the net is also referred to sometimes as \"the line.\" Palla eh! uses only a line painted on the ground to mark territory, and this is probably all it was originally. The cord was added for pallacorda probably just to keep the players on their respective sides of the court, and a ball that went under the cord, yet across the line, was probably still a fair shot. Later illustrations of pallacorda and tennis show tassels hung from the cord to indicate if a ball went below the cord. The net was merely an enhancement on the tassels, and it now serves three functions: marking territory, controlling player movement, and restricting the flight of the ball. When modern lawn tennis adopted real tennis' net, it also brought with it these three functions.\n\nThe fact that variants of palla are all street games, and that they are clearly related to real tennis suggests something of the development of the latter sport's court. It had been assumed that a real tennis court developed from the layout of monastery cloisters. This is mainly due to the early popularity of the game among clerics, and similarities of some court features to a cloister. However, this theory has two problems. Cloisters are usually square, while a tennis court is much longer than it is wide. Secondly, some of the similar features of tennis courts were actually introduced in the 16th century, and earlier layouts were less similar to cloisters. The study of palla has led many to suggest that the first tennis courts were made by those who wanted to play the street game, but could afford a more private and much cleaner setting. Similarities to cloisters in later court designs could either be coincidence, or intentional innovations. The proportions of the court and features such as penthouses and windows could easily relate to medieval streets.\n\nThe game is still practiced today in six villages in Southern Tuscany. Normally the game is played from Spring through Summer.\nTournaments are held in each village between July and August. The actual schedule of the tournaments is confirmed each year a few weeks before its start.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is serving three life sentences in a California prison after being convicted of multiple kidnapping charges after a 1992 incident. \n\nStewart became a born-again Christian, and was determined to \"get the message out\" via television. His first major appearance was at the 1977 NBA Finals; by the time of the 1979 MLB All-Star Game, broadcasters actively tried to avoid showing him. He \"appeared behind NFL goal posts, near Olympic medal stands, and even at the Augusta National Golf Club.\" At the 1982 Indianapolis 500, he was behind the pits of race winner Gordon Johncock. Stewart would strategically position himself for key shots of plays or athletes. Stewart's fame led to a Budweiser beer commercial and a \"Saturday Night Live\" parody sketch, where he was portrayed by Christopher Walken.\n\nStewart was briefly jailed by Moscow police at the 1980 Summer Olympics. In the late 1980s, he began a string of stink bomb attacks. Targets included Robert Schuller's Crystal Cathedral, the Orange County Register, the Trinity Broadcasting Network, and a Christian bookstore. The stated intent of an attempted attack at the American Music Awards was to show the public that \"God thinks this stinks.\"\n\nStewart was arrested in 1992 after a standoff in a California hotel during which he entered a vacant room with two men he was attempting to kidnap and surprised a maid who then locked herself in the bathroom. Reportedly, Stewart believed that the Rapture was due to arrive in six days. During the standoff, he threatened to shoot at airplanes taking off from nearby Los Angeles International Airport, and covered the hotel room windows with \"John 3:16\" placards.\n\nStewart is currently serving three consecutive life sentences in prison on kidnapping charges, having rejected a plea deal of 12 years in order to spread his message in open court. After being sentenced, he began a religious tirade and had to be restrained by bailiffs. He became eligible for parole in 2002, but was denied as recently as March 2010; his next parole review was to be in 2017. After this conviction, he was found guilty of four stink bomb attacks.\n\nStewart ran a blog until the time of his parole denial. He is the subject of the 1997 documentary \"Rainbow Man\", directed by Sam Green.\n\nStewart was married four times, most notably to Margaret Hockridge. The two met at a church in Virginia in 1984. They began traveling across the country together in 1985. While on the road, they married in St. Louis in 1986. During the 1986 World Series, Hockridge said that Stewart tried to choke her for standing in the wrong spot with a John 3:16 sign. They divorced in 1990, but kept in touch for many years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "678792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=678792", "title": "Swing bowling", "text": "Swing bowling\n\nSwing bowling is a technique used for bowling in the sport of cricket. Practitioners are known as swing bowlers. Swing bowling is generally classed as a subtype of fast bowling.\n\nThe essence of swing bowling is to get the cricket ball to deviate sideways as it moves through the air towards or away from the batsman. To do this, the bowler makes use of six factors:\n\n\nThe asymmetry of the ball is encouraged by the constant polishing of \"one side\" of the ball by members of the fielding team, while allowing the opposite side to deteriorate through wear and tear. With time, this produces a marked difference in the aerodynamic properties of the two sides .\n\nBoth turbulent and laminar airflow contribute to swing. Air in laminar flow separates from the surface of the ball earlier than air in turbulent flow, so that the \"separation point\" moves toward the front of the ball on the laminar side. On the turbulent flow side it remains towards the back, inducing a greater lift force on the turbulent airflow side of the ball. The calculated net lift force is not enough to account for the amount of swing observed. Additional force is provided by the pressure-gradient force.\n\nTo induce the pressure-gradient force the bowler must create regions of high and low static pressure on opposing sides of the ball. The ball is then \"sucked\" from the region of high static pressure towards the region of low static pressure. The Magnus effect uses the same force but by manipulating spin across the direction of motion. A layer of fluid, in this case air, will have a greater velocity when moving over another layer of fluid than it would have had if it had been moving over a solid, in this case the surface of the ball. The greater the velocity of the fluid, the lower its static pressure.\nWhen the ball is new the seam is used to create a layer of turbulent air on one side of the ball, by angling it to one side and spinning the ball along the seam. This changes the separation points of the air with the ball; this turbulent air creates a greater coverage of air, providing lift. The next layer of air will have a greater velocity over the side with the turbulent air due to the greater air coverage and as there is a difference in air velocity, the static pressure of both sides of the ball are different and the ball is both 'lifted' and 'sucked' towards the turbulent airflow side of the ball.\n\nWhen the ball is older and there is an asymmetry in roughness the seam no longer causes the pressure difference, and can actually reduce the swing of the ball. Air turbulence is no longer used to create separation point differences and therefore the lift and pressure differences. On the rough side of the ball there are scratches and pits in the ball's surface. These irregularities act in the same manner as the dimples of a golf ball: they trap the air, creating a layer of trapped air next to the rough side of the ball, which moves with the surface of the ball. The smooth side does not trap a layer of air. The next layer of air outward from the ball will have a greater velocity over the rough side, due to its contact with a layer of trapped air, rather than solid ball. This lowers the static pressure relative to the shiny side, which swings the ball. If the scratches and tears completely cover the rough side of the ball, the separation point on the rough side will move to the back of the ball, further than that of the turbulent air, thereby creating more lift and faster air flow. This is why a new ball will swing more than an old ball. If the seam is used to create the turbulent air on the rough side, the tears will not fill as quickly as they would with laminar flow, dampening the lift and pressure differences.\n\nReverse swing occurs in exactly the same manner as conventional swing, despite popular misconception. Over time the rough side becomes too rough and the tears become too deep – this is why golf ball dimples are never below a certain depth, and so \"conventional\" swing weakens over time; the separation point moves toward the front of the ball on the rough side. When polishing the shiny side of the ball, numerous liquids are used, such as sweat, saliva, sunscreen, hair gel (which bowlers may apply to their hair before a game) and other illegal substances like Vaseline (applied to the clothing where the ball is polished). These liquids penetrate the porous surface of the leather ball. Over time the liquid expands and stretches the surface of the ball (which increases the surface area meaning more lift) and creates raised bumps on the polished side, due to the non-uniform nature of the expansion. The valleys between the bumps hold the air in the same manner as the tears on the rough side. This creates a layer of air over the shiny side, moving the separation point towards the back of the ball on the shiny side. The greater air coverage is now on the shiny side, giving rise to more lift and faster secondary airflow on that side. There is therefore lower static pressure on the shiny side, causing the ball to swing towards it, not away from it as in conventional swing.\n\nThe rough side tears hold the air more easily than the shiny side valleys, so to maintain the air within the valleys the initial air layer must have a very high velocity, which is why reverse swing is primarily, but not necessarily, achieved by fast bowlers. Due to the less static nature of the initial air layer it takes longer for the swing to occur, which is why it occurs later in the delivery. This is why conventional and reverse swing can occur in the same delivery.\n\nCold and humid weather are said to enhance swing. Colder air is denser and so may affect the differential forces the ball experiences in flight. When looking at humidity, changes between 0% and 40% humidity appear to have little to no effect on the ball's swing; yet, when approaching 100% humidity \"condensation shock\" has been observed enhancing the swing of the ball .\n\nTypically, a swing bowler aligns the seam and the sides of the ball to reinforce the swing effect. This can be done in two ways:\n\nThe curvature of swing deliveries can make them difficult for a batsman to hit with his bat. Typically, bowlers more commonly bowl outswingers, as they tend to move away from the batsman, meaning he has to \"chase\" the ball to hit it. Hitting away from the batsman's body is dangerous, as it leaves a gap between the bat and body through which the ball may travel to hit the wicket. Also, if the batsman misjudges the amount of swing, he can hit the ball with an edge of the bat. An inside edge can ricochet on to the wicket, resulting in him being out bowled, while an outside edge can fly to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders for a catch.\n\nAn inswinger presents relatively fewer dangers to the batsman, but on some particular days can be devastating due to risk of being bowled or leg before wicket. Shane Bond was considered a great exponent of inswing bowling.\n\nAn inswinger combined with a yorker can be especially difficult for the batsman to defend against, especially if used as a surprise delivery after a sequence of outswingers.\n\nThere has been a distinct lack of left-arm swing bowlers in the game. Some of the most famous left-arm bowlers were Pakistan's Wasim Akram, India's Zaheer Khan, Australia's Alan Davidson and Sri Lanka's Chaminda Vaas.\n\nNormal swing occurs mostly when the ball is fairly new. As it wears more, the aerodynamics of the asymmetry changes and it is more difficult to extract a large amount of swing. When the ball becomes very old—around 40 or more overs old—it begins to swing towards the shine. This is known as \"reverse swing\"—meaning a natural outswinger will become an inswinger and vice versa. In essence, both sides have turbulent flow, but here the seam causes the airflow to separate earlier on one side. The result is always a swing to the side with the later separation, so the swing is away from the seam.\n\nReverse swing tends to be stronger than normal swing, and to occur late in the ball's trajectory. This gives it a very different character from normal swing, and because batsmen experience it less often, they generally find it much more difficult to defend against. It is also possible for a ball to swing normally in its early flight, and then to alter its swing as it approaches the batsman. This can be done in two ways one for the ball to reverse its direction of swing, giving it an 'S' trajectory: the other is for it to adopt a more pronounced swing in the same direction in which the swing is already curving; either alteration can be devastating for the batsman. In the first instance, he is already committed to playing the swing one way, which will be the wrong way to address swing which is suddenly coming from the opposite direction: in the second instance, his stance will be one which is appropriate for the degree, or extent, of the expected swing, and which could suddenly leave him vulnerable to LBW, being caught behind, or bowled. Two consecutive deliveries from Wasim Akram, one of each type, were considered to be the turning point of the 1992 World Cup Final.\n\nPioneers and notable practitioners of reverse swing have mostly been Pakistani fast bowlers. In the early days of reverse swing, Pakistani bowlers were suspected of ball tampering to achieve the conditions of the ball that allow reverse swing. According to Shaharyar Khan, reverse swing was invented by Salim Mir, who played for the Punjab Cricket Club in Lahore and taught it to his team-mate Sarfraz Nawaz. Sarfraz Nawaz introduced reverse swing into international cricket during the late 1970s, and passed their knowledge on to their team-mate Imran Khan, who in turn taught the duo of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. The English pair of Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones, having been taught by Troy Cooley and the Indian bowlers like Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar, are also well known for the ability to reverse swing. Bowlers tend to disguise the direction of reverse swing by running up starting with the opposite hand before switching hands and covering the ball for as long as possible before release. Neil Wagner utilizes this to show the ball is reversing, but disguises the direction of swing.\n\nPlaying swing bowling is considered to be a hallmark of a batsman's skill.\n\nFirstly, a batsman needs good eye reflexes which are considered to be a key skill when facing swing bowling. Secondly a batsman often needs to anticipate \"beforehand\" what the ball will do and adjust accordingly to play swing bowling. This can be done by observing the bowler's grip and action (which may have a marked difference depending on which type of swinger is to be delivered), by observing the field set, which may depend on the types of deliveries expected (as a rule outswingers will have more slips assigned) or by means of prior knowledge of the bowler; many can bowl or are proficient in only one type of swing. Traditional methods include the batsmen playing the ball as late as possible, and not playing away from the body. Other effective measures for combating swing bowling include standing well outside the crease, thus giving the ball less time to swing; and guessing the direction of swing based on the seam position observed in the ball's flight.\n\nSince reverse swing occurs at faster speeds, later in the trajectory of the ball and with no real obvious change in action and grip (Waqar Younis from Pakistan for example had the same action and grip for nearly all his deliveries.\n\nControversy regarding reverse swing has never left modern cricket, as the Pakistani team was accused of ball tampering by the Australian umpire Darrell Hair during the fourth test against England in 2006 when the ball began to reverse swing after the 50th over. His co-umpire Billy Doctrove supported him. A hearing subsequently found that there was insufficient evidence to convict anyone of ball tampering.\n\n\n"}

Important sets of weight classes were those specified in 1909 by the National Sporting Club of London, and those contained in the 1920 Walker Law which established the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC). NYSAC recognized champions from its foundation in 1920. The National Boxing Association (NBA) was founded by other U.S. state bodies in 1921. Until the 1960s, both usually recognised the same lineal champion. However, disputes could arise if the champion retired or moved to a different weight class. Occasionally, the International Boxing Union (renamed the European Boxing Union in 1946) recognised a different champion. The disputes were usually short-lived as a lucrative fight would be organised between the rival champions.\n\nThe growing popularity of boxing outside of the USA led to creation of various boxing organizations, each strengthening their influence (most notably BBBofC) and having their own champion. This resulted in a growing number of boxers claiming to be legitimate champions. On August 23, 1962, the NBA officially became the World Boxing Association and moved their headquarters to Panama City, Panama. A year later NYSAC along with European Boxing Union and BBBofC supported creation of the World Boxing Council. In April 1983, members of United States Boxing Association along with Robert W. Lee (a former WBA vice-president) voted to expand the organisation and form the USBA-International. The organization later changed the name to International Boxing Federation. The inaugural IBF Heavyweight Champion was Larry Holmes, who relinquished the WBC title to accept IBF's recognition, thus helping the newly formed organization to establish its legitimacy. Another major sanctioning body, the World Boxing Organisation, was established in 1988 in San Juan, Puerto Rico by a group of local businessmen. At the beginnings, when most of the challengers for WBA, WBC and IBF titles were Americans, WBO had a wider variety of countries, mainly United Kingdom, represented in title bouts. As of 2018, WBO, WBC, IBF and WBA are all recognized as major boxing organizations by each other and the International Boxing Hall of Fame. \n\nChampions were recognized by public acclamation. A champion in that era was a fighter who had a notable win over another fighter and kept winning afterward. Retirements or disputed results could lead to a championship being split among several men for periods of time. With only minor exceptions, the heavyweight division remained free from dual title-holders until the 1960s. For an early example, see the 1896 World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nGradually, the role of recognizing champions in the division evolved into a more formal affair, with public acclamation being supplemented (or in some cases, contradicted) by recognition by one or more athletic commissions, sanctioning organizations, or a combination of them. The most notable examples with respect to the heavyweight division have included:\nThere are also titles that aren't considered major but play a significant role in legitimizing the champion:\n\nThough these lists do not include \"The Ring\" and lineal championship fights after 1921, they only include title fight wins in weight classes where the champion have also captured \"The Ring\" or lineal title.\n\nKeys:\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nThese lists do not include \"The Ring\" and lineal championship fights after 1921.\n\nKeys:\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nThough these lists do not include The Ring and lineal championship fights after 1921, they only include title streaks during which the champion captured \"The Ring\" or lineal title. \n\nKeys:\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nThese lists do not include \"The Ring\" and lineal championship fights after 1921.\n\nKeys:\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nAs of 03, 2018.\n\nBelow is a list of longest reigning champions in boxing measured by the individual's longest reign.

The pair developed a comfortably baggy pair of shorts with an elastic waistband. Zubaz was registered as a trademark in 1989. Initially, they were marketed as a comfortable, functional pair of shorts for weightlifting. Michael Hegstrand, Joseph Laurinaitis and manager Nick Derella used their professional wrestling personae as The Road Warriors to help popularize the pants in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThey hoped to make a pair of shorts that would stretch and expand with the body during a workout. In a short time, the shorts became wildly popular in the United States. The Zubaz company sold $100 million worth of products in 1991 alone. The company slogan was \"Dare to be Different.\"\n\nAlthough Zubaz began as a line of shorts, the brand was extended into long pants, caps, shirts, and even diapers. The pants are tapered at the ankle, with the outer part of the leg being longer than the inner part. They have an elastic waistband to allow for greater flexibility and movement. The pants were originally created in a zebra print, but later began to be sold in almost any design imaginable.\n\nRegardless of the specific design, Zubaz are almost always bright, flashy, and often ostentatious. Zubaz designed the uniforms of several Arena Football League teams in the early 1990s, including the Tampa Bay Storm and the now-defunct New Orleans Night. However, these designs were considered outlandish and were soon replaced.\n\nIn a 1993 survey in \"Inside Sports\" magazine, Zubaz finished third in the voting for \"Worst Thing to Happen in Sports\" that year. Ahead of it were the retirement of Michael Jordan and the death of wrestler Dino Bravo.\n\nThe long pants were the most popular item in the product line. Despite the decline in popularity, fans still sometimes wear Zubaz pants in team colors at professional football games.\n\nZubaz manufactured \"slider shorts.\" These shorts had the famous wild patterns at the bottom of the garment while the rest of the garment displayed the name and logo of the sport team and the Zubaz name.\n\nThe original business went bankrupt in 1996 and Truax and Stock bought back the trademark rights. In 2007, Zubaz resurfaced, offering a limited production release of the original classic Zubaz patterns. In 2014 the brand fully resurfaced with a wider selection on its internet storefront. The revived brand opened its first storefront in Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls, a mall in Niagara Falls, New York, in November 2016; Zubaz chose Western New York as its first brick-and-mortar location because of the brand's particular association with the Buffalo Bills, as fans of the franchise have consistently been one of the brand's most loyal customer bases.\n\nIn another sign of the resurrection of the Zubaz brand, on July 16, 2008 the Saint Paul Saints independent professional baseball team wore Zubaz pants during their game against the Sioux City Explorers. The bases were also painted in a recognizable Zubaz tiger-striped pattern. On the December 6 edition of professional wrestling TV show, \"TNA Impact\", Christopher Daniels and Kazarian wrestled the main event in pink and black Zubaz pants. Lately, the Russian Curling team wore Kansas City Chiefs pants in the 2014 Winter Olympics. The Detroit Tigers also recently wore the Zubaz pants.\n"}
