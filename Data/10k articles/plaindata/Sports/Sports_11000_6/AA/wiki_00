The Flames posted their best record in franchise history to that time, as Calgary's 95 points was the third best total in the league. The Flames' defence of their 1986 Campbell Conference championship was quickly snuffed out by the Winnipeg Jets, as the Flames were upset in the first round of the playoffs in six games by their Manitoba rivals.\n\nJoe Mullen captured his first Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for gentlemanly conduct, while Al MacInnis was named a Second Team All-star.

The 2010 season started two weeks earlier than in previous years to accommodate the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, in which netball is a core sport. 69 matches were played over 17 weeks, including an initial 14-week round-robin stage, followed by a three-week finals stage. Several rule changes were also implemented in the 2010 season.\n\nAfter 14 weeks of round-robin competition, the Swifts emerged undefeated as minor premiers, progressing to the finals stage with the Thunderbirds, Magic and Steel. But the Thunderbirds progressed to the grand finale, inflicting the first loss of the season for the Swifts, who lost the preliminary final to the Magic one week later. The grand final was contested on 11 July in Adelaide between the Thunderbirds and Magic. In front of a capacity crowd, the Thunderbirds defeated the Magic by 52–42 to emerge as champions for the 2010 season.\n\nThe format of the 2010 season was identical to those of previous seasons. During the round-robin stage, played over 14 weeks, each team played every other team once, and played teams from their home country a second time. Teams also had one bye somewhere between Rounds 6–10. Week 4 of the round-robin stage was the designated Rivalry Round, in which all games were trans-Tasman match-ups. The top four teams from the round-robin stage progressed to the finals stage, played over three weeks in a Page-McIntyre System.\n\nRound 14 matchups in 2009 were identical to round 14 matchups in 2010, round 4 matchups in 2009 were identical to round 11 matchups in 2010, and round 1 matchups in 2009 were identical to round 3 matchups in 2010. Also, for the Rivalry Round, round 13 matchups in 2009 were identical to round 4 matchups in 2010. In addition, in trans-Tasman matches the home and away teams were switched around from 2009 to ensure that the teams got to play home and away games over two years: e.g., the Thunderbirds hosted the Magic in round 14 in 2009, but the same game in 2010 was hosted by the Magic.\n\nThe 2010 season saw the first use of the assistance package for teams that finished in the bottom two placings of the competition ladder for two consecutive seasons. The Central Pulse finished 10th in 2008 and 2009, winning one game in 26 outings, and were granted additional money as well as a second import player.\n\nMatches were played under international test rules, with a few exceptions. Games that had tied scores at the end of regular time continued into extra time until a winner emerged. Starting from 2010, two additional rule changes were also implemented: coaching was permitted during time stoppages, and venue clocks showed the countdown of the final minute of play, rather than turning blank for that time.\n\nAll ten teams from the inaugural season continued in 2010.\n\nThe 2010 ANZ Championship season, the third year of the competition was expected to be the best yet. Teams organised their franchises, and then went on the hunt to poach opposition players. There was excitement on both sides of the Tasman, but in New Zealand it was all coming from one team. The Northern Mystics went on a shopping spree, signing Magic stars Maria Tutaia and Joline Henry. Along with Canterbury Tactix Silver Fern Larrissa Willcox and Jamaican international Althea Byfield, to join current internationals Catherine Latu and Temepara George in Auckland. The Magic, who lost the services of Tutaia and Henry, made up for it by inking former Silver Ferns shooter Jodi Brown and Australian Peta Scholz from retirement. The new duo, teamed up with Magic stalwarts Irene van Dyk, Laura Langman and Casey Williams.\n\nIn Wellington, the Pulse who lost Byfield, made up for it by bringing in English import Ama Agbeze and Adelaide Thunderbirds benchie Jane Altschwager. They also snared Silver Fern defender Katrina Grant from the Steel, to form a nice looking team. At the Canterbury Tactix, the retirement of captain Julie Seymour as well as losing Jodi Brown and Sonia Mkoloma left the red and black's midcourt in all sorts of trouble. Southlander Hayley Crofts was called into the franchise, but made no impact. They initially signed off out of favour Queensland Firebirds defender Peta Stephens, but an injury ruled her out of contention.\nAnd down south at the Southern Steel, after the retirements of star players Donna Wilkins, Adine Wilson and Megan Hutton, along with Katrina Grant moving north, it left the Steel in trouble too. They still pulled together a play off potential side. Former Silver Fern and Sting player Leana de Bruin was back from pregnancy and was pulled into the backline. With the re-signing of internationals Daneka Wipiiti, Megan Dehn, Liana Leota, Wendy Frew and Sheryl Scanlan, Steel still had high chances for 2010.\n\nUp north in Australia, the Queensland Firebirds answered their shooting problems, by snaring Australian Diamonds star Natalie Medhurst from the Adelaide Thunderbirds. She set up a wonderful combination with returning Jamaican import Romelda Aiken. In the Firebird's midcourt, Lauren Nourse led the way without fellow Wing Attack Tamsin Greenway. The English player decided to not return for a third year of ANZ Championships netball. At the NSW Swifts, the Sydney club picked up touring, English defender Sonia Mkoloma, to give her a third franchise to play at. Mkoloma, again along with Catherine Cox, Susan Pratley and Kim Green were the key players to their line-up.\n\nIn Melbourne, the Vixens opted against bringing in an import. The 2009 champions kept consistency in their lineup. Shooters Sharelle McMahon and Caitlin Thwaites, midcourter Natasha Chokljat and defenders Julie Corletto and Bianca Chatfield all inked again with the team. At the Thunderbirds, Coach Jane Woodlands-Thompson returned as coach, along with stars Natalie von Bertouch, Kate Beveridge, Mo'onia Gerrard and import Geva Mentor. After the loss of Medhurst, and which speculation since has arisen Woodlands-Thompson wanted rid of her, she was replaced by former netballer, turned basketball player Carla Borrego. The tall Jamaican would become a huge hit.\n\nThe cash strapped West Coast Fever again kept their coach Jane Searle, and the core group of players. There were no huge changes in the Perth team's line-up, apart from Leah Shoard returning to Australia, after a year with the Steel and Janelle Lawson returning home from the Firebirds.\n\nAn early pre-season tournament was held in early February in Christchurch. This tournament featured the Steel and Tactix, as well as a New South Wales state team, in which the Steel emerged undefeated. The first of the major pre-season tournaments in 2010 was held in Queenstown, New Zealand from 19–21 February, featuring the Firebirds, Mystics, Pulse, Tactix and Steel, along with a team from the Australian Institute of Sport. The Queensland Firebirds emerged undefeated from the Queenstown tournament.\n\nThe official pre-season tournament is the Netball Cup (formerly the SOPA Cup), which was held in Sydney from 5–7 March. In 2010, the tournament was contested between the Firebirds, Swifts, Vixens, Thunderbirds and Fever from Australia, and the Pulse and Steel from New Zealand. Once again, the Queensland Firebirds went through the tournament undefeated to emerge champions.\n\nDaylight savings ends on Sunday 4 April in New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.\n\nAll matches in this round were trans-Tasman clashes. Goals scored by all teams from each country were tallied together, and the country with the highest number of accumulated goals won. After five matches, Australia won the 2010 Rivalry Round with a 4–1 win-loss record and a goal aggregate of 288–230 against New Zealand.\n\nThe Festival of the Stars is a charity match where two celebrity teams play each other to win money for their charities. The captains of the match in 2010 were the Australia's ONE HD Sunday commentators, Luke Darcy and Liz Ellis. The match was played in two 15-minute halves and umpired by Natalie Medhurst and Wendy Fleming. The celebrity teams were as follows:\n\nDuring the match, Darcy's team scored the first two goals, giving them a two-goal lead, however Ellis' team came back with two goals from Spencer. Late in the half, Archer scored a goal on the goal circle (not legal in standard rules) and that was the only goal scored by him. At the end of the first half, Darcy's team lead 4-3. In the second half, a change was made by Ellis' team with Ellis moving to WD and shifting Archer and Swanson to GD and GK respectively to add more height in the defense circle, while Darcy placed Twigley to GA and Hughes to WD. Later on, Ellis called time to put Melbourne Vixens player Caitlin Thwaites at GS, moving Moloney to WD, Ellis to GK and benching Swanson. After a thrilling battle, despite Thwaites's goals and tricks and Spencer's long range shot on goal, Darcy's team won the match by two goals. As a result, the MARS Red beyondblue team won $10,000 for winning the match as well as $2,000 for scoring the first goal in both halves and $100 for every goal scored after, adding up to $12,900 for the beyondblue charity. The Holden Cruze National Breast Cancer Foundation team won $5,000 as runner-up prize and $100 for every goal scored, adding up to $5,900 for the National Breast Cancer Foundation charity.\n\nThe MARS Red Best Young Player Award is awarded to the player who's under the age of 25, has not played more than five matches in previous ANZ Championship seasons and has not played in more than five international matches. Only five nominees are chosen, one selected each week from rounds 10-14. Sharni Layton won the award.\n\n"}

It is owned and operated by Arena Racing Company.\n\nThe racecourse is a left-handed oval track of 1 mile 4 furlongs and 25 yards, with a run-in of nearly half-a-mile.\n\nAt above sea level, Bath is Britain's highest flat racecourse, although National Hunt courses Hexham and Exeter are higher.\n\nRacing was first recorded at Bath in 1728. In 1811, the first major meet at Bath Racecourse was held, under the auspices of a local family, the Blathwayts. Originally there was just one meet a year at the course, lasting for two days, but gradually over the years, the number of meets increased to its present level of twenty-two. In the early years, the Somerset Stakes was the major race of the calendar, and this race is still held annually. There were a number of grandstand buildings in those days and people used to watch the races from their carriages, lined up beside the track.\n\nDuring World War II, the racecourse was used as a landing field by the Royal Air Force and named RAF North Stoke.\n\nIn 1953, Bath Racecourse was the site of a criminal plot surrounding the \"Spa selling plate\". Having two horses that looked almost identical, the gang substituted a good horse for a poor one. They bet heavily on the substituted horse and damaged the power supply to the racecourse, which prevented the bookmakers from changing the odds which remained at 10-1. The horse won the race and the gang would have profited highly had not racing officials become suspicious and called in Scotland Yard. The gang were subsequently brought to justice.\n\nIn 2015/16 the racecourse facilities underwent a significant redevelopment and investment programme, funded by the Arena Racing Company. The racetrack has a new look with bands of buttermilk and French grey, the parade ring is revamped and the Beckford Bar opened. The new Langridge Grandstand opened in July 2016 and has various new facilities including a canopied roof garden from which races can be watched. It is also available as a venue between race days for corporate events, dinners and weddings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1330842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1330842", "title": "Benefit season", "text": "Benefit season\n\nA benefit season is a method of financially rewarding professional cricketers that is used by English county cricket teams to compensate long serving players. \n\nThe system originated in the 19th century to help out professional cricketers who were paid low wages and generally could not play professional cricket much beyond the age of forty. Early \"benefits\" typically comprised the gate receipts of a designated match. Nowadays, a benefit season comprises a sequence of events such as dinners and auctions of memorabilia over the course of the summer cricket season or the whole year in which the relevant cricket season falls. In almost all cases only one player from a club is given a benefit in each season in order to avoid two or more players competing to attract money from the same people. Until recently, players with less service might sometimes be given a \"Testimonial\" season or match: the difference appears to have been largely semantic, but for almost half a century one of the less financially sound English first-class county clubs, Derbyshire, made a point of not awarding benefits, but giving testimonials instead. The Australian cricketer Colin McCool was awarded a testimonial in 1959, only three years after joining Somerset.\n\nThe player will appoint a \"benefit\" committee to help him organise his benefit, composed of other current and former cricketers, and any business and professional people with relevant skills and contacts who are willing to help out. All the profits go to the player and they are exempt from tax following the ruling of the House of Lords over the benefit for James Seymour, the Kent cricketer whose benefit in 1920 was the subject of a protracted legal case brought by the Inland Revenue and not fully resolved until 1926. \n\nA player may be rewarded with a benefit season by his county committee about ten years after receiving his county cap, but this varies from player to player, partly because in order for his benefit to qualify for tax exemption a player must not have had a contractual expectation of a benefit. Occasionally a player stays with a county long enough to be awarded a second benefit. Sometimes this is also known as a \"testimonial\": an example is Graham Gooch of Essex who had a benefit in 1985 and a testimonial in 1995. \n\nThe system has survived into the 21st century even though county cricketers are now reasonably well paid. The amounts raised generally vary from a few tens of thousands of pounds to low six figures. A few players (such as Graeme Hick ) have made over three hundred thousand pounds. The amount that a player makes from his benefit depends on factors such as his personal popularity, contacts, social skills and fame at least as much as on his degree of financial need and the quality of his contribution to his club on the pitch. One aspect of this which attracts particular scepticism is that famous international cricketers, some of whom will retire as millionaires in any case, tend to make more out of their benefit season than less well off players who have never played for their country, and who seem closer to the being the kind of \"deserving cause\" for whom benefits were first devised. The supporters of the system contend that it brings about two million pounds a year into the English game which would otherwise be lost if the system were to be abandoned.\n\nSince the 1990s the proportion of cricketers who move from one county club to another during their playing career has been rising sharply, and many players who do so never receive a benefit. However, salaries have risen sharply in recent years, and many players prefer to hunt for a better salary rather than stay where they are in the hope of being awarded a benefit at some point. A conventional pension scheme for cricketers has also been introduced to complement the benefit system.\n\nIf a county has no player in its squad who is eligible for a benefit but has not yet had one, it may organise a \"county benefit\" or a \"youth cricket benefit\" to raise funds for special projects, but these often do not raise much money as many people are more interested in taking part in a benefit if they know that they are helping an individual.\n\nTax exempt events to raise money for long serving players are also used in some other sports such as football, although they tend to be called testimonials in that case and are usually a single match rather than a season of events. The tax free status of benefits and testimonials rests on a single early 20th century legal ruling, and great care has to be taken by every benefit committee not to breach the rules in some small way which might lead to the player receiving a demand for tax on the entire amount, or to provoke the Inland Revenue into challenging the exemption on an overall basis. However, testimonials for prominent professional footballers have in modern times increasingly become charity fundraisers in which the player donates either a large part or all of the proceeds to one or more organisations.\n\n"}

Its center character is Gus, a football-playing mule. The film did well at the box office and was released on home video in 1981. The movie is remembered for two sequences involving a hotel and a supermarket.\n\nThe film opens in Yugoslavia with the Petrovic family watching their son Stepjan winning a soccer game. Their other son Andy works on his farm, and can't play soccer at all, after falling into the well by accident. One day, Andy discovers Gus can kick a soccer ball long distances when Andy shouts, \"Oyage!\". [Note: there is fierce debate in the \"Gus\" fan community re the spelling of \"Oyage.\" Some spell it \"Oyatch!,\" while others give it a more Yugoslavian-sounding, \"Ojigdz!\" The word itself has no meaning in any of the Yugoslavian languages, though.]\n\nMeanwhile, in Los Angeles, the California Atoms are a professional football team owned by Hank Cooper (Ed Asner) and coached by the inept Coach Venner (Don Knotts). They are the worst team in the league and have not won a game in years. Cooper also owes a lot of money to two mobster bookmakers named Charles Gwynn (Harold Gould) and Cal Wilson (Dick Van Patten). When Cooper tells them he cannot pay his debts, the bookies give him a last chance bet: if the Atoms win the upcoming Super Bowl, all gambling debts will be forgiven, but if they do not win, Gwynn and Wilson will take ownership of the team.\n\nDesperate to draw in fans, Cooper looks for a great half time show. His secretary, Debbie (Louise 'Liberty' Williams), sees a story in her parents' Yugoslavian newspaper about Gus. Debbie flies to Yugoslavia and hires Gus and Andy. After Gus is a hit in his first halftime show, Cooper and Venner decide to put him in the game as a place kicker. The other team protests, but as the rule book does not require a player to be human, Cooper allow Gus to kick, And able to kick a field goal from anywhere in the field, the Atoms win. The Atoms go on to win their next few games thanks to Gus, and move to first place in their division. The only catch is that that Gus will only kick when Andy holds the ball and shouts the command. Debbie is assigned to watch over Andy and Gus, since she can speak Serbian. A romance begins between them, aided by Gus.\n\nGwynn and Wilson, realizing their deal with Cooper is backfiring, hire two incompetent criminals named Crankcase (Tim Conway) and Spinner (Tom Bosley) to stop Gus from playing and make the team lose. Through their schemes, Crankcase and Spinner cause the Atoms to lose two games. Despite the losses, the Atoms make the playoffs. Andy becomes a celebrity, but his parents remain unimpressed, saying he only holds the ball for Gus.\n\nBefore the playoff game, Spinner convinces Andy that Debbie has been injured in a car accident. When Andy arrives at the hospital, Crankcase locks him up. Without Andy, Gus refuses to kick, and the Atoms fall behind. In the final quarter, Debbie dresses up in Andy's uniform and convinces Gus to kick a field goal, scoring the winning points. Andy, who managed to escape, arrives after the game is over. He tells Debbie his father is right: Andy is nothing, and anyone can hold the ball for Gus.\n\nWith the Atoms headed to the Super Bowl, Spinner and Crankcase steal Gus and replace him with an ordinary mule. Spinner and Crankcase check into a local hotel and lock up Gus with them and Gus breaks the TV and the hotel room door. At the Super Bowl, Andy quickly realizes the mule he has is not Gus, and he and Cooper leave by helicopter to search for Gus. When the two criminals watch the game on TV, Gus goes wild and escapes. In a long comic sequence, Crankcase and Spinner chase Gus into a local supermarket where they unsuccessfully attempt to recapture the mule. The criminals make a huge mess in the supermarket, including stepping on bottles of Ketchup and Mustard, making a mess of themselves, and getting in the way of a strong man who beats them up, Or landing in a basket of balls for the children, and finally, attempting to ride Gus, who throws them into a huge ready made cake, destroying it completely. Running from the supermarket, Spinner and Crankcase are apprehended for mule napping and for causing an extended amount of damages in the supermarket. Gus is spotted from the air by Andy and Cooper. They airlift Gus to the Super Bowl and arrive by half-time.\n\nWith Gus back in the game, the Atoms make a comeback. With 45 seconds left on the clock, the Atoms are down 16–15 with the ball on their own five-yard line. Gus lines up for a field goal attempt, but slips in the mud and misses the football. In the scramble for the ball, Gus knocks it over to Andy, who runs 95 yards for the touchdown. As Andy and team walk off the field to celebrate their win, Debbie winks at Gus and says, \"I know you did that on purpose\". Gus winks back at her.\n\nThis is the only one of their five films together where Don Knotts and Tim Conway do not share any scenes.\n\nJohnny Unitas appears as a commentator with Bob Crane (in his last feature film appearance) supplying the play-by-play during the football broadcasts. Dick Enberg did the play-by-play for the local games.\n\nThe name \"Hank Cooper\" was used in the 1997 Disney film \"The Love Bug\" as the name of the mechanic (Bruce Campbell) who meets Herbie. In \"Herbie Goes Bananas\" (1980), a partygoer wearing an Atoms jersey is briefly seen during a masquerade ball scene.\n\n\"Gus\" would be the final feature film for Bob Crane as well as the last film in the promising, yet short career of then 20-year-old Grimes. This was also the final film appearance of Virginia O'Brien.\n\n"}

{"id": "28380259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28380259", "title": "MMA gloves", "text": "MMA gloves\n\nMMA gloves or grappling gloves are small, open-fingered gloves used in mixed martial arts bouts. They usually have around 4–6 oz of padding and are designed to provide some protection to the person wearing the glove, but leave the fingers available for grappling maneuvers such as clinch fighting and submissions.\nSmall, open-fingered gloves were first mandatory in Japan's Shooto promotion and were later adopted by the UFC as it developed into a regulated sport. Gloves were introduced to protect fighters' fists from injuries, as well as reduce the number of facial lacerations (and stoppages due to cuts) that fighters experienced without gloves. The introduction of gloves was also intended to encourage fighters to use their hands for striking to allow more captivating matches for fans. There are some similarities to the wrist-supporting, closed-thumb, broken-knuckle \"kempo gloves\" popularized by Bruce Lee's 1973 movie \"Enter the Dragon\".\n\nCompetition gloves - Most professional fights have the fighters wear 4 ounce (110 g) gloves, whereas amateurs may wear a slightly heavier 6 ounce (170 g) glove for increased protection. According to the rules, UFC allows gloves between 4-6 ounces, and even heavier for certain larger sized gloves, e.g. 2 XL – 4 XL.\n\nSparring gloves - Generally speaking MMA sparring gloves weight is usually 7 ounces. When sparring there is obviously a lot of punching involved, from working the bag to actual sparring with a partner. Both of these require that your knuckles are adequately protected and cushioned from the forces put upon them. The 7oz refers to the weight of the padding inside the gloves and not the overall weight.\n\nGrappling gloves - Otherwise known as hybrid or training gloves these are used mainly for clinch work/grappling.This type of glove has less padding than sparring or competition gloves. In addition each finger can be moved independently allowing for more gripping ability.\n\nThe impact of gloves on the injuries caused during a fight is a controversial issue, mostly looked at in relation to boxing. The use of padded gloves in fights protect the fists of the wearer but don't prevent brain injury unless they are so large that they become difficult to use. These gloves protect the fists of the wearer and allow stronger punches than in bare-knuckle fights, and it is the changes in acceleration to the head as a whole that tears the blood vessels, not the impact with the glove.\n\n"}

Rupp Arena also serves as home court to the University of Kentucky men's basketball program, and is named after legendary former Kentucky coach and University of Kansas alumnus Adolph Rupp. With an official capacity of 23,500, it is currently the largest arena in the United States designed specifically for basketball. In Rupp Arena, the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team is second in the nation in college basketball home attendance. The only other basketball-specific arena in US history larger than the arena is the now-demolished Charlotte Coliseum. Rupp Arena also regularly hosts concerts, conventions and shows.\n\nThe arena's primary tenant is the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team, but the Kentucky Wildcats women's basketball team has also hosted games there in recent years, particularly an upset in early 2006 of the #1 Tennessee Lady Volunteers. Rupp Arena was the host of the 1985 NCAA Final Four, won in an upset by eighth-seeded Villanova. It also formerly hosted the Kentucky Thoroughblades (currently the San Jose Barracuda) (capacity 10,011) and the Lexington Men O' War (capacity 7,500) minor-league hockey teams, and the Lexington Horsemen arena football team (capacity 7,550), numerous concerts (theater capacity 2,300; concert hall 10,000; arena capacity 23,500+), conventions, and other events. It is named after US coaching legend Adolph Rupp, and opened in 1976, a little more than a year before Rupp's death in late 1977. Since the 1985 Final Four, Rupp Arena has hosted a number of NCAA Tournament regional games, most recently in 2013 when it hosted second and third round NCAA Tournament games. Rupp Arena is also home to Kentucky's high school boys' basketball Sweet Sixteen, a single elimination tournament which determines the state champion with sixteen teams representing each of Kentucky's regional high school champions. The construction of Rupp Arena came to a halt during the beginning of the dig after the discovery of bones left behind from the Inuit Tribe local to the Lexington Kentucky area. It was decided to move the build site 1,000 feet in order to properly respect the Native Indian Burial ground.\n\nThe arena has an official capacity for basketball of 23,500, but has packed in more than 24,000 for many UK basketball games. This is possible because less than half of the seating (about 10,000) consists of chair-back seats, all of them in the lower seating bowl. The lower bowl also incorporates a student standing-room area called the \"eRUPPtion Zone\" behind one goal. The upper bowl is completely made up of bleacher bench seats that allow more capacity than chair-back seats. Unlike many arenas built in the following years, it has no luxury suites, and has never been renovated to add them. However, in 2001, the arena received some minor renovations including four oversized video boards, new lower bowl seating, new locker rooms, and a new court.\n\n\n\nRupp Arena was approved for various renovations in 2015 to improve the fan experience and to attract more concerts and major events. The approved renovations totaled at $15.8 million that included a new center-hung scoreboard, advertising ribbon boards, wireless internet for fans, and improved roof infrastructure. \n\nThe entire list of renovations as stated on UK Athletics' website include:\n\nSince 2004, Rupp Arena has been home to numerous pageants. Including the Miss Kentucky pageant, The Annual Rupp Arena Dog show and the Kitty America Pageant for cats.\n\n\nThe Kentucky Wildcats have set or broken the Rupp Arena attendance record 24 times since the arena opened in 1976. In those games, the Wildcats have won 20 times and lost 4 times.\n\n"}

The film crew was made up of professionals from in and around Fitzgerald's hometown of Valhalla, NY, with each crew member coincidentally living in towns along the Metro North Railroad's Harlem Line – leading to the creation of Harlem Line Pictures and, later, Harlem Line Media.\n\nAlthough the film received positive reviews from The New York Times, New York Post, Irish Echo and National Public Radio, Fitzgerald opted to release it immediately before receiving a traditional distribution deal. On 25 February 2006, \"The Emerald Diamond\" debuted to a sold out crowd of 250 people at the Jacob Burns Film Center in New York. Among those in the crowd was Major League Baseball Executive Vice-President Robert Manfred.

The value of the contract was £25 million (US$42.1 million). The stadium is noted for its distinct gabled architecture, first pioneered by the John Smith's Stadium. The upper-tier corners do not have seating due to concerns of health and safety access.\n\nThe stadium was opened in 1997 by John Prescott, a Labour Party politician who was the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time.\n\nThe stadium consists of four stands: The Carrs Pasties (North) Stand at one end; the South Stand (Franking Sense and also the away end) at the other end; the West Stand at one side of the pitch; and the Nat Lofthouse (east) Stand at the other side.\n\nWhen the stadium was named after long-time team sponsor Reebok in 1997, fans considered the title impersonal and believed that too much emphasis was being placed on financial considerations. This opposition considerably lessened after the stadium was built, as fans grew accustomed to the name and were bolstered by Reebok's status as a local company.\n\nThe Macron title was applied in July 2014 after the Bolton Wanderers club finalised a partnership with the large Italian sportswear brand. In April 2014, club chairman Phil Gartside stated that he was \"proud\" to be associated with Macron and had \"been very impressed with their [Macron's] passion for football\". A four-year duration was negotiated for the Macron deal and the club had the option to extend at completion.\n\nWhen the deal with Macron came to an end in August 2018 the stadium was again renamed, this time as the University of Bolton Stadium.\n\n\nIn addition to hosting football games, the stadium also offers other services, such as a hotel and function rooms.\n\nThe stadium has been used to host concerts by famous acts such as Oasis, Pink, Elton John, Coldplay, The Killers & Little Mix.\n\nFootage from the Coldplay concert was used in the video for the single, \"Fix You\", which shows lead singer Chris Martin entering the stage as the song reaches its climax.\n\nThe stadium also hosted the UK Open Darts Championship, boxing matches with local boxer Amir Khan and 16 April 2011 when it hosted its first rugby union match when Sale Sharks lost to London Irish.\n\nEvery November until 2012, the Reebok Stadium hosted Kidz up North which is one of the largest free UK exhibitions totally dedicated to children with disabilities and special needs, their parents, carers and professionals who work with them.\n\nThe venue's Premier Suite is home to the UK's leading amateur mixed martial arts event, Full Contact Contender. As of 16 March 2013 The Reebok has played host to three Full Contact Contender events.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted six rugby league matches. The results were as follows;\n\nOn 30 May 2018, it was announced that the stadium will host a first ever Double-header for the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup.\n\nIn 2014 the club established Bolton Wanderers Free School at the stadium. It was a sixth form centre offering sports and related courses for 16- to 19-year-olds. The centre utilised the facilities of the stadium for most of its teaching and learning.\n\nRecord attendance: 28,353 v Leicester City, 28 December 2003\n\nLowest attendance for a competitive match: 1,540 v Everton U23s, 30 August 2016 Football League Trophy, Northern Group Stage, Game One\n\nLowest Premier League attendance: 17,014 v Derby County, 2 January 2008\n\nRecord UEFA Cup attendance: 26,163 v Atlético Madrid, 14 February 2008 Last 32 1st leg\n\nRecord FA Cup attendance: 23,523 v Arsenal, 12 March 2005 quarter finals\n\nRecord League Cup Attendance: 18,037 v Tottenham Hotspur, 27 October 2004 3rd round\n\nThe stadium's West Stand lies about 200 metres from Horwich Parkway railway station. The station lies between Lostock and Blackrod on the Manchester to Preston Line. Football specials operate to and from this station on matchdays. Bus services are laid on by the club from across the borough when the Wanderers are at home.\n\nOn non-matchdays Horwich Parkway is served by three services an hour in each direction, operated by Northern or TransPennine Express. Numerous routes serve bus stops near or at the ground, operated by Arriva and FirstBus.\n\nBolton Wanderers unveiled a bronze statue of their most famous player, Nat Lofthouse, prior to a game against Queens Park Rangers on 24 August 2013. The statue, which cost £100,000 due to the generosity of public donations and sponsors, is situated near to the south-west corner of the stadium and was officially revealed by club owner Eddie Davies in a special ceremony.\n\nClub chaplain Phil Mason, chairman Phil Gartside and the son of Nat Lofthouse – Jeff Lofthouse, also took part in the ceremony as did sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn. Hedges-Quinn had taken 18 months overall to complete the project having worked successfully on the statues such as that of Bob Stokoe at The Stadium of Light, Ted Bates at St Mary's Stadium and Sir Bobby Robson and Alf Ramsey at Portman Road.\n\n"}

It evolved in North Yorkshire (Great Britain) and was launched in February 2006 at the Youth Sport Trust's Sports Colleges Conference. The sport was continually developed by the International Federation and in 2012 the Federation approved a move by the worldwide membership to rename the sport VX to cater for its international development.\n\nVX has continued to be popular in schools in the UK and is now being adopted by universities, colleges, youth organisations, Street Games and the military. It is also attracting interest from the Prison Service and Primary Care Trusts. It now has a foothold in 25 countries of which 15 have National Governing Bodies(NGBs).\n\nVX is a totally gender-neutral sport. Males and females play on a totally equal footing in all disciplines and at all levels. It is also accessible to players of all abilities. It is not an adaptation of any single sport however there are elements of several sports including dodgeball, lacrosse, basque pelota and hockey.\n\nThe sport, originally known as Rock-It-Ball, is a ball sport which originated from the UK. It evolved in North Yorkshire (Great Britain) and was officially launched at the Youth Sport Trust's Sports Colleges Conference in February 2006.\n\nRock-It-Ball spread through schools in the UK. It featured on four of the Youth Sport Trust’s programmes, began to be played regularly in 17 countries, and saw the establishment of an international federation and eleven national governing bodies\n\nOver time the international administrative body had taken the original game and further developed and extended it, setting up a full sports infrastructure. In 2012, in order to cater for the international growth, the sport was rebranded by the international community to VX. All the clubs and NGBs followed suit and now all leagues, tournaments and international competitions are under the VX banner.\n\nIn August 2017 VX gained international recognition as a sport at the General Assembly of the Sport Recognised Association.\n\nVX is played by two teams of five players. The court is roughly the size of a sports hall with four badminton courts. In the USA, basketball courts are used. Each player uses a VstiX. This is made up of a control bar and a thrower/catcher at each end. Players are not restricted to a certain area but can go anywhere on court. They must dribble by rock-ing the ball between the two ends, or by using one end of the VstiX to bounce the ball on the floor. Five balls are in play. One point is scored by hitting an opponent with the ball between the shoulders and the feet. Three points are scored by catching an opponent's thrown ball. When a player is hit (s)he must stand still, raise a hand and look to the referee. The referee records the point and tells the player to play on. The referee is assisted by two umpires positioned on the opposite side of the court. The role of the umpires is simply to look for infringements. All infringements incur a three-point penalty. Violence results in ejection from the game and disciplinary action. Examples of infringements are:\n\n\nFormal matches consists of four quarters each of which lasts four minutes.\n\nAs part of the development of VX, the International Federation introduced Singles (V2), a 1v1v1 (V3) version and Doubles (V4) \nThe new versions were created by the International Federation to develop the sport and provide individuals with an opportunity to set up clubs more easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Federation was established in December 2006 but changed its name to Global VX when the sport was rebranded in 2012. Global VX administers the sport on a global basis, assists with the establishment and running of NGBs and organises international competition. Global VX also runs the annual rules committee which takes place every January.\n\nGlobal VX also has an awards programme. The annual 'Executive' Awards recognise the work of volunteers in the sport. 'The Person of the Year' Award is awarded to an outstanding volunteer who has done exceptional work to promote and develop the sport. The 'Person of the Year' and the Executive Awards are announced annually on Dec 31st\n\n2010: Person of the Year: Conrad Broughton (England) \n2011: Person of the Year: Matti Chasan Bergstein (Denmark) \n2012: The first Person of the Year since the sport was rebranded: VX Uganda. Unusually, the award did not go to one individual but was presented to VX Uganda as a body to recognise the work and effort that had been made by several people to grow the sport in Africa \n2013: Person of the Year: Eric Clark (Ripon Lions) & John Sheepy (Boroughbridge Lions) \n2014: Person of the Year: Tony Notarianni (USA)\n2015: Person of the Year: Dr Suman Shankar Tiwari (India) \n2016: Person of the Year: Matty Horsfield (England) \nAny member affiliated to Global VX (e.g. player, coach, administrator) can nominate any other affiliated member who they consider to have made an outstanding contribution to the sport. Any nominee with three nominations passes to the next stage for voting by the committee. The Hall of Fame Awards generally takes place every two years. In 2010 the voting committee felt unable to differentiate between the 3 nominees who reached the voting stage and so, as an exception, voted to induct all three.\nIn 2008 the founders of the original sport (Paul Hildreth, Paul Law, Bob Eldridge) were honoured by inducting them into the newly established Hall of Fame. \n\nThe 'Legends' Award and Gallery is reserved for players who have reached an outstanding level of achievement. This award was instigated in 2012 as a direct result of the achievements of Scotland's Scott MacMichael and is not intended to be an annual honour.\n\nAs the sport has grown its impact has started to be recognised by external bodies:\n\nThe role of Official VX Ambassador has been taken by Olympic Diver Jack Laugher. \nVX's first patron is trail blade runner Phil Sheridan. The latest patron is Sylvia Grice MBE, a member of Ripon Lions.\n\n\n\nCentres of Excellence and coaching academies are being established. \n\n2012 The Sport Becomes VX \n\n"}
