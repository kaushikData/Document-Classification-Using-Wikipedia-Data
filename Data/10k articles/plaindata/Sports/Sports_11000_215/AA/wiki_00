The season consisted of matches between football clubs in the colony of Victoria. The Carlton Football Club was the premier club for the season.\n\nFour clubs participated in senior football during the 1870 season: Albert-park, , and South Yarra.\n\nThe formal practice of senior clubs playing matches \"at odds\" against junior clubs was established during the season. In matches played at odds, the senior team fielded fifteen players and the junior team fielded twenty players. Matches played at odds were quite competitive: the premier club Carlton was unbeaten at even strength against senior clubs, but lost two of five matches played at odds. Three metropolitan junior clubs – Collingwood, Richmond and Carlton United – played against the senior clubs during the year. Senior clubs also played matches against provincial clubs Ballarat (at odds) and (even strength) during the year.\n\nDuring the 1871 season, the senior clubs competed in specific matches for the Challenge Cup; and, separately, a premier team was selected based on all matches during the season, including Challenge Cup matches.\n\nThe Challenge Cup which South Yarra had put up for contest at the start of the 1870 season was returned by Albert-park to South Yarra at the end of the year, following the dispute over whether or not Albert-park had formally won it.\n\nSouth Yarra opted to put the trophy up for contest again in 1871. Albert-park declined to contest it, although it continued to play senior games against the other clubs. The remaining clubs – Carlton, Melbourne and South Yarra – decided that each club would play the others three times during the season, and the top two would play a single playoff match for the Cup. \n\nThis meant that the Cup was being contested in a league-type competition, and by traditional definitions was no longer a Challenge Cup with a perpetual holder. \n\nTwo of the three Carlton-Melbourne matches were postponed by four weeks due to rain, while the two unplayed Carlton-South Yarra matches were scratched as they would have had no effect on the outcome.\n\nWith this victory in the Grand Final (the first of its kind in history), Carlton claimed undisputed and permanent ownership of the South Yarra Challenge Cup. \n\nIn addition to winning the Challenge Cup, Carlton was adjudged premiers for the season, and Melbourne were runners-up. \n\nThe two clubs were the dominant senior clubs in the colony, and the premiership was mostly determined based on the win-loss record in matches between the two: their four matches, including the Challenge Cup Grand Final, yielded one win for Carlton, two draws, and one disputed match (claimed as a win by Melbourne and as a draw by Carlton). \n\nAlbert-park was third, having failed to defeat Carlton or Melbourne, but having beaten South Yarra (winless since 1868 in senior matches) during the year.\n\nCarlton's and Melbourne's overall records as reported at each club's annual meeting in 1872 (reporting different results for the disputed match between the teams) are given below. The Senior results include the Challenge Cup final.\n\n"}

Throughout history, they were pioneers in crossing the seas and oceans, and played a significant role in the maritime and shipbuilding history. The 18th century witnessed the arrival of the vessel \"Sohar\" to the City of Canton (China), establishing once more the Omani maritime supremacy.\n\nThe logo design is derived from such splendid historical inputs, by embodying the simplest forms of the elements. The logo reflects the relation between the people of Oman and the rest of the worlds, especially with the people of Asia, by hosting the shining sun of Asia in Muscat, projecting a better future for the Asian sports, aided by the ship that will carry it to its international and continental sports destinations.\n\nThe strong and high waves under the sail provide the logo with solidity, vitality and sustainability and challenges, as represented by the flood of competitors in the various games, hosted in the high seas, and at the same time, touching the attractive Omani beaches, giving the local dimension of the nature of the beach games' tournament.\n\nThe expressions under the beach are colored by the bright colors of the Omani flag, expressing the devotion of the Omani people to their deep-rooted customs and traditions, expressed in the complete harmony of the elements.\n\nOmran (Omani Government owned tourism company) developed the dedicated 100 Hectare Site at Wudam Al Sahil near Muscat to host the 2010 Asian Beach Games. The development comprised a mixture of temporary and permanent facilities such as a hotel for media and guests, an athletes village, administration building, press and media centre, restaurants and recreational facilities, site wide infrastructure including a marina and adequate parking facilities. Associated with the above-mentioned development, dedicated playing pitches with temporary stands to accommodate around 300 spectators for preliminary events and up to 1,500 spectators for the final event were built. Further to this, the opening and closing ceremonies were held in the amphitheatre for up to 5,000 spectators.\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n\n43 out of 45 Asian countries participated in these games. The only exception being North Korea and Macau. According to the Games' official website, Kuwaiti athletes participated the Games under the Olympic flag because the Kuwait Olympic Committee was suspended due to political interference in January 2010\n\n\nThailand led the medal table with 14 gold medals and total of 36 medals. 27 NOCs won at least a single medal with 14 NOCs winning at least a single gold medal, thus leaving 16 NOCs failing to win any medal at the Games.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28943868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28943868", "title": "Cardiff Kook", "text": "Cardiff Kook\n\nMagic Carpet Ride is the official name of a high bronze sculpture of a surfer by Matthew Antichevich, an artist and sculpture instructor at Mt. San Jacinto College. The sculpture is mounted on a 6-foot high granite base with poetry inscription by Robert Nanninga, and is in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Encinitas, California, United States. Locals have nicknamed \"Magic Carpet Ride\" as The Cardiff Kook, a pejorative name popularized by the local surfing community. \n\nThe sculpture was commissioned by the Cardiff Botanical Society at a cost of approximately $120,000. It was installed in 2007 at the entrances to the San Elijo State Beach campground on Coast Highway 101. The $92,000 construction cost was raised by the Botanical Society, with the $30,000 installation funded by the city of Encinitas. The sculpture's base also included plaques listing names of the project's major donors. \"Magic Carpet Ride\"/\"The Cardiff Kook\" is registered and archived by Public Art in Public Places.\n\nThe sculpture was intended to depict a surfer performing a \"(backside) floater\", but the Botanical Society's budget could not cover the cost of an additional water/wave component. Antichevich was chosen from more than 50 bidders on the commission. His original design was for a female surfer on a breaking wave, which also exceeded the budget, and the Botanical Society chose an image of a male surfer on a granite plinth that halved the amount of required bronze. Other proposed designs were discussed with the Botanical Society, including the figure of professional surfer Rob Machado and a surfer on a longboard. According to Antichevich and to Michael Ames Clark (then-chairman of the Botanical Society's selection committee), the sculpture represented the joy and awkwardness of a young boy learning how to surf, in acknowledgement of the area's attraction to novice surfers.\n\nThe San Diego Architectural Foundation, in its annual \"Orchids & Onions\" awards for the best and worst architecture of the year, awarded the \"Magic Carpet Ride\" an Onion rating in 2007. The nickname of \"The Cardiff Kook\" comes from derogatory surfer slang for a \"wannabe\" surfer, and reflects the low opinion that local surfers had of the sculpture. The sculpture was criticized by surfers for its unrealistic depiction of a surfer. Other critics maintained that the feet were positioned incorrectly, the hands were odd in appearance, the figure was too thin and effeminate, and that as a whole it resembled the figure of a novice surfer about to fall off his board (as the artist intended) rather than that of a more experienced surfer.\n\nThe early criticism surprised both the Botanical Society and artist Matthew Antichevich, who stated that he did not expect the piece to be as widely misunderstood as it was upon its unveiling. The original models for the sculpture included a wave component, and Antichevich stated that if the wave had been included, the figure's surfing stance would have been better understood. Antichevich also noted that it was impossible, while creating the sculpture, to look at its hands from the necessary angles, since he \"wasn't working 16 feet in the air\". At the sculpture's installation, Deputy Mayor Jerome Stocks defended the piece and answered critics with \"Well, you go raise your own 90,000 dollars and put up a statue that you like.\". After its early criticisms, the sculpture has evolved into a humorous landmark attracting frequent \"costuming\" efforts. The popularity of \"The Cardiff Kook\" has led to its own Google Maps feature listing, and themed community events, such as \"The Cardiff Kook Costume 5K & 10K Run.\"\n\nThe sculpture began to attract pranksters who dressed the surfer in various attire, costumes, even with extended backdrops, which at times approached vandalism. The list of such pranks is extensive, often coordinated with current events: a pink pleated skirt, bikini top and lucha libre wrestling mask; a Zorro costume; a pumpkin head (at Halloween); a Santa Claus hat (at Christmas); a full Uncle Sam costume for United States Independence Day; the hood of the prisoner on a box photograph from Abu Ghraib prison; a clown costume; a loincloth and surrounded by a prehistoric setting while being snatched up by a sculpted pterodactyl in flight; and a papier mâché statue of a shark about to swallow up the surfer from beneath.\n\nThe shark costume was one of two prank additions to the sculpture performed by local artist Eric Hardtke, himself a sculptor who works in bronze and stone, and accomplices. The first was a 2009 addition next to the statue of a wave crashing down over the \"Kook\", carrying a wire mesh outline of another surfer about to knock the \"Kook\" off his board. This wave still exists, since it was removed undamaged by city employees, and is stored at the ranch of Paul Ecke, a local grower of poinsettias. It is constructed of wood, paper, and chicken wire, and Hardtke stated that \"It was to make the point that you could make a better sculpture for less money.\".\n\nThe second alteration to the \"Kook\" by Hardtke was the shark. This 15 foot work was made of papier mâché over a wooden frame, and estimated by Hardtke to have consumed $450 and two weeks. It was constructed in two halves, which were then sealed together around the \"Kook\" using foam sealant that was moulded to resemble ocean spray coming down off the flanks of the shark. It was installed in the early morning, around 04:00, of 2010-07-24 by Hardtke and some two dozen friends, and had been presaged over the preceding few days by the appearance of similarly constructed shark fins, positioned across the street from the statue and gradually moved closer to the \"Kook\" over a period of days, to imply a shark drawing close underwater to the \"Kook\". $400 in diverted employee time was used to clean up the shark. Unlike the wave, the shark was damaged when it was removed by four city public works employees, who took 10 minutes to split it apart using hand saws in the morning of 2010-07-26 and two hours overall to remove it.\n\nHardtke himself was not critical of the \"Kook\", and considers it a fair representation of average surfers, saying that \"I'm sure I look like that. That's why everybody is so down on it. They like to think they don't look like that, but they do.\".\n\nWhile such pranks are officially discouraged by Encinitas mayor Dan Dalager and city authorities, it is unofficially acknowledged that the sculpture's repeated costuming or vandalism is a boost to Cardiff's tourist trade. Antichevich regards the vandalism as an insult to his work. No legal action has been taken against such vandals, because no damage has been done to the sculpture itself. It does not cost the city extra to clean up the various defacements, but it does divert time from tasks that city employees could otherwise be doing. Mayor Dalager has stated that, while he personally likes the attention that this gives to the sculpture, he does not want the city to be having to divert city time and money away from the city's real problems. Deputy city manager Richard Phillips concurred, comparing the vandalism of the \"Kook\" to school pranksters dressing up a school's mascot, stating that \"it gets old\" and that city time and money could be better spent fixing potholes than cleaning up pranks.\n\n\n"}

Partially motivated by its bid for the 2002 Fifa World Cup, the league succeeded in its policy as the Yukong Elephants, Ilhwa Chunma, and the LG Cheetahs moved to Bucheon, Cheonan, and Anyang respectively in 1996.\n\nBy 1995, there have been three professional football clubs based in Seoul: Ilhwa Chunma, LG Cheetahs and Yukong Elephants. Korea Professional Football League wanted to spread football popularity nationally and secure football-specific stadiums for bidding of 2002 FIFA World Cup. In order to achieve this goal, Korea Professional Football League and Blue House forced all three clubs in Seoul to move to other cities. The intention was to compensate for the decreased number of home cities under the new system.\n\nThis was not proceeded smoothly with the affected clubs. K League offered them a condition that they can move back to Seoul. If a club among them build a football-specific stadium in Seoul, the club will get the priority to return to Seoul. Then all three clubs agreed to move.\n\nThis policy brought resistances from each clubs. In October 1995, Yukong threatened K League that they will dissolve the club if they have to move out of Seoul.\n\nIn November 1995, K League announced that if the clubs don't accept the decision, they will be excluded from the K League. Once the plan was announced, many city governments hoped to attract these clubs.\n\nYukong Elephants took the city of Bucheon's offer of a new 20,000-seater Bucheon Stadium with another football-specific stadium facilitated two training fields.\n\nThe club decided to use Seoul Mokdong Stadium as their temporary home ground until the construction of Bucheon Stadium to be completed. The club changed its name to Bucheon Yukong as a part of the policy on January 4, 1996.\n\nFor Ilhwa Chunma, the city of Cheonan offered a deal for the club.

Seoul Metropolitan Government understood that potential investment on a new Seoul club had not made due to the amount of the share, they agreed to cut 10 billion KRW in the way of sponsoring the new team with the same amount of money. Also, KFA agreed to pay 10 billion KRW of their share to reduce the burden to a new Seoul club, leaving only 5 billion KRW to pay.\n\nIn the meantime, Anyang LG Cheetahs declared their interest in moving to Seoul and Seoul Metropolitan Government welcomed it, though KFA prioritized the foundation of a new club.\n\nBut many candidate companies (including KT Corporation and Kumho Asiana Group), which received proposal from KFA and K League, refused to found a new Seoul-based club.\n\nOn 6 February 2004, K League committee officially allowed the existing K League club's move to Seoul and sent relocation proposal to all K League clubs.

{"id": "3038615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3038615", "title": "Glanford Park", "text": "Glanford Park\n\nGlanford Park is a football stadium in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England, and is the current home of Scunthorpe United.\n\nOpened in 1988 at a construction cost of £2.5 million, Glanford Park was the first new purpose-built Football League stadium to be built in England for 33 years, since Southend United moved to Roots Hall in 1955.\n\nThe stadium is Scunthorpe’s second ground, with the Iron having previously played at the Old Showground from 1899 to 1988. The ground’s record attendance was set at 9,077 for a Carling Cup Third Round tie against Manchester United on 22 September 2010.\n\nScunthorpe United originally played at the Old Showground, which was located towards the centre of the town at the junction of Doncaster Road and Henderson Avenue. In the wake of the Bradford City disaster of 1985, it was determined that substantial improvements would have to be made to the Old Showground in order for it to meet new regulations, improvements which the club could not afford. Ultimately it was decided that the best course of action was to relocate to a new out of town site, with the sale of the land occupied by the Old Showground being used to raise much needed revenue for the club. After the club relocated, the Old Showground was demolished and replaced by a Safeway supermarket, which was subsequently sold to Sainsbury's in 2004.\n\nConstruction began during 1987 on a site located on the outskirts of Scunthorpe, close to the start of the M181 motorway and approximately 1.5 miles West of the Old Showground. The ground was fully completed prior to the commencement of the 1988–89 season and was officially opened at the start of the season by Princess Alexandra. Upon its completion, it was the first new Football League stadium in England for 33 years.\n\nGlanford Park originally opened with a capacity of 11,190, both of the goal-ends being standing terraces, however this capacity was later reduced to its current value of 9,088 in 1991.\n\nThe name Glanford Park was derived from its funding by the then Glanford Borough Council, before North Lincolnshire became a unitary authority.\n\nFor all but one of its first 17 seasons (1999–2000), the stadium staged fourth tier football prior to Scunthorpe’s promotion to League One in 2005, since when they have appeared in either League One or the Football League Championship for all but one season (2013–14).\n\nPremier League side Manchester City visited Glanford Park on 24 January 2010, in the FA Cup Fourth Round. City won the match 4–2, which saw Robinho score his final goal in English football.\n\nThe record attendance is 9,077 for a 5–2 loss against Manchester United in the League Cup on 22 September 2010.\n\nThe record attendance for a Football League game stands at 8,921 for a 2–1 win over Newcastle United in the Championship, coming on 20 October 2009.\n\nGlanford Park is a relatively simple affair, consisting of four single-tier stands of equal height, three of which are all seated. Although there is no seating in any of the four corners between stands the ground is still fully enclosed, with the rear wall and roof of each stand simply being extended to meet in the corners. Since February 2011, the south-west corner of the ground has been completely filled-in with the construction of the ‘Legends Lounge’, with the other three simply containing refreshment kiosks.\n\nThe SPB stand (formerly the Scunthorpe Telegraph Stand) is the West side stand, and is the ground's main stand. It runs along the entire length of the pitch and is fully seated.\n\nThe two southernmost blocks of seating are marketed as the club's family area. To the rear of the stand are the club’s various executive suites. These include a restaurant which is open throughout the week, a set of executive boxes, the Sir Ian Botham Executive Lounge and the Legends Lounge, which occupies the south-west corner. Members of the media are allocated a small area of seating at the rear of the stand, and a television gantry is also positioned within the roof space.\n\nThe players’ tunnel is located centrally within this stand, with the team dugouts being located on either side of the opening. The dressing rooms are naturally all located within this stand.\n\nOther facilities located within this stand include the club’s main offices, ticket office, club shop and sports injury clinic.\n\nThe name of this stand is the most frequently changing. It is much more commonly known as the \"Doncaster Road End\" among supporters, or even simpler, the \"Donny Road End\" or “DRE”. This stand is the only terraced stand at Glanford Park, and typically houses the more vocal supporters.\n\nThe club’s popular bar, ‘The Iron Bar’ is located below this stand and is open on match days prior to kick-off and during half-time.\n\nThe Britcon Stand was due to be fitted with seating after the 2010–11 season due to Football League regulations that all standing areas must be made seating following three seasons in the Championship, however Scunthorpe United were subsequently relegated, reprieving the terrace for the time being.\n\nThe Clugston Stand (formerly the Grove Wharf Stand prior to the start of the 2012-13 season) is the East stand of the ground, and houses seated home supporters. Disabled seating is available at the front of the stand in four allocated bays. The Clugston Stand now also features a can bar and a food outlet in the void beneath the seating, which along with additional toilet facilities was installed at a cost of £100,000 in 2006.\n\nThe stadium’s match day control room is located at the rear of this stand.\n\nThe AMS Stand (also known as the South Stand or “Railway End”) houses away supporters, with a maximum capacity of 1,678. Extra away seating can be made available for away fans if required by sectioning off the corner of the Clugston Stand closest to the AMS Stand, however this is only usually done for games such as local derbies. A bar for visiting fans is positioned below this stand.\n\nThe AMS Stand was originally a terrace much the same as the Britcon Stand when the stadium was first built, however it was later decided that in the interests of safety that this end should be converted to seating only. This conversion was made during 1991, with the original blue seats being sourced from Aston Villa F.C. as a part of a deal involving the sale of defender Neil Cox to the West Midlands club. These seats were replaced with newer claret-coloured seats prior to the 2007–08 season.\nGlanford Park has hosted several international matches during its lifetime. The first international match to be played at the stadium came on 10 September 1991, with England U21 emerging as 2–1 victors against Germany U21. Since that date Glanford Park has played host to several England U19, England U17 and England U16 games, as well as a match between Portugal U17 and Australia U17 on 25 August 2010, in which Portugal ran out as 4–3 winners.\n\nIn the \"Scunthorpe Telegraph\" on 14 December 2006 it was announced that the club were looking to expand the Doncaster Road End of the stadium. Potential improvements mentioned included a second tier and expansion of the club's restaurant. In announcing the plan for expansion, the club's chairman Steven Wharton acknowledged that they were not currently filling the stadium to capacity on a regular basis, but added that he was preparing for a future situation where a larger capacity could be required. This would have been the first major redevelopment of any stand at Glanford Park since its opening, however these plans were later shelved.\n\nUnder government regulations the club would have been required to convert the Doncaster Road End to seating if relegation from the Championship had been avoided in 2010–11. In an effort to overturn this ruling, supporters launched a Keep Scunthorpe Standing campaign. The club revealed revised expansion details in September 2010, with plans to add a three-level building behind the current terrace to include a larger supporters' bar, club shop and ticket office. The capacity of the ground would not have increased; this is due to the change from a terrace to a seating area. As it so happened, the Iron were relegated from the Championship at the end of the 2010–11 season and so these plans never came to fruition.\n\nIn January 2014, it was revealed that Scunthorpe United proposed a move to a brand new stadium. The projected cost of the project was £18 million and the new stadium was intended to have a capacity of 12,000. The new stadium was intended to integrate the stadium with 24/7 businesses, including a hotel, an office, training and catering facilities in order to maximize revenue for the club. It was further announced in July 2014 that the site of the new stadium was intended to form the focal point of the new 'Lincolnshire Lakes' development. The project was planned for commencement during 2015-2016. Due to issues regarding procurement of the land for the new stadium and issues with one of the developers, the intended site of the new stadium was moved approximately to the south, and the construction start date was pushed back to some point in late 2017. In October 2017, Scunthorpe United confirmed that the proposal to relocate to the new stadium had been dropped, stating a new aim to instead redevelop and extend Glanford Park, thus securing the immediate future of the stadium for the time being.\n\n\n"}

She was lifted first by Kayla Cullen, then by young defender Jessica Moulds.\n\nThe move was first seen in the 1970s with Chris Stanton the first recognised performer, and more recently at the 2011 Netball World Championships, when it was used by the Singapore defenders in an attempt to intercept the ball, albeit unsuccessfully. \n\nThe move was very controversial and made the news in New Zealand and Australia, with many people questioning the legality and/or ethics. IFNA has said the move is legal, and umpires will not rule against it, although current rules forbid the touching of the net or rim while performing the hoist.\n\nSince its unveiling, it was used several times throughout the season, although it wasn't as effective. It was attempted by several other teams and players, although it has only been successful once without Harrison, when her Mystics team mate Rachel Rasmussen lifted Kayla Cullen. It has been attempted several times throughout the international season, including by the Australian defenders, most notably in the 2012 Fast5 Netball World Series.\n"}

They were derived by the famous physiologist Archibald Vivian Hill.\n\nThis is a popular state equation applicable to skeletal muscle that has been stimulated to show Tetanic contraction. It relates tension to velocity with regard to the internal thermodynamics. The equation is\n\nwhere \n\nAlthough Hill's equation looks very much like the van der Waals equation, the former has units of energy dissipation, while the latter has units of energy. Hill's equation demonstrates that the relationship between F and v is hyperbolic. Therefore, the higher the load applied to the muscle, the lower the contraction velocity. Similarly, the higher the contraction velocity, the lower the tension in the muscle. This hyperbolic form has been found to fit the empirical constant only during isotonic contractions near resting length.\n\nThe muscle tension decreases as the shortening velocity increases. This feature has been attributed to two main causes. The major appears to be the loss in tension as the cross bridges in the contractile element and then reform in a shortened condition. The second cause appears to be the fluid viscosity in both the contractile element and the connective tissue. Whichever the cause of loss of tension, it is a viscous friction and can therefore be modeled as a fluid damper\n\nThe three-element Hill muscle model is a representation of the muscle mechanical response. The model is constituted by a contractile element (CE) and two non-linear spring elements, one in series (SE) and another in parallel (PE). The active force of the contractile element comes from the force generated by the actin and myosin cross-bridges at the sarcomere level. It is fully extensible when inactive but capable of shortening when activated. The connective tissues (fascia, epimysium, perimysium and endomysium) that surround the contractile element influences the muscle's force-length curve. The parallel element represents the passive force of these connective tissues and has a soft tissue mechanical behavior. The parallel element is responsible for the muscle passive behavior when it is stretched, even when the contractile element is not activated. The series element represents the tendon and the intrinsic elasticity of the myofilaments. It also has a soft tissue response and provides energy storing mechanism.\n\nThe net force-length characteristics of a muscle is a combination of the force-length characteristics of both active and passive elements. The forces in the contractile element, in the series element and in the parallel element, formula_9, formula_10 and formula_11, respectively, satisfy\n\nOn the other hand, the muscle length formula_13 and the lengths formula_14, formula_15 and formula_16 of those elements satisfy\n\nDuring isometric contractions the series elastic component is under tension and therefore is stretched a finite amount. Because the overall length of the muscle is kept constant, the stretching of the series element can only occur if there is an equal shortening of the contractile element itself.\n\nMuscles present viscoelasticity, therefore a viscous damper may be included in the model, when the dynamics of the second-order critically damped twitch is regarded. One common model for muscular viscosity is an exponential form damper, where\nis added to the model's global equation, whose formula_19 and formula_5 are constants.\n\n"}

{"id": "27341062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27341062", "title": "Kenya Commercial Bank RFC", "text": "Kenya Commercial Bank RFC\n\nKCB Rugby Club is a rugby union team based in Nairobi, Kenya. It was formed in 1989 after the disbanding of Kenya Breweries RFC when their main sponsor, Kenya Breweries, pulled out. That year they joined the Kenya Cup. Their first match was against Impala RFC whom they beat 96-6. In 1994 the team was relegated to the Eric Shirley Shield, however by 1996 they had regained their position in Kenya's top rugby league. The club now has a 2nd XV team which has performed well, winning the Mwamba Cup, and Eric Shirley Shield several times.\n\nThe history of Kenya Commercial Bank Rugby Football Club cannot be told without that of Kenya Breweries Rugby Football Club, its forerunner. Kenya Breweries RFC was formed in 1983 when a few employees of the parent company Kenya Breweries Limited (KBL) who had played rugby for other clubs felt the need to start their own institutional side. Among the pioneer players were flanker Justus Mugaa M’mpwii who had featured for Mean Machine RFC and Mwamba RFC and the first captain D. Maina who had featured for Impala RFC at fly half.\n\nThe first training sessions took place in August 1983 at the Jamhuri High School in Nairobi. Many KBL employees who had never touched a rugby ball in their lives enthusiastically signed up to play for the team. Kenya Breweries RFC played their first ever match, a friendly against Barclays Bank RFC at the RFUEA grounds in October of the same year and made their first competitive appearance at the Jamhuri Sevens in December.\n\n1984 saw the team join the Eric Shirley Shield, the Kenyan second division rugby union league, earning promotion to the first division Kenya Cup in 1987. They would be relegated back to the Eric Shirley Shield in 1988 but returned to the Kenya Cup in 1989. The team received a jolt in February 1989 when the sponsor, KBL announced plans to disband a majority of its sports teams with the exception of its soccer and netball teams.\n\nKBL’s decision threw the team into confusion. There were crucial decisions to be made with players wondering whether they would disperse and go their separate ways. A few players ended up at Barclays Bank RFC. Some joined to Mwamba RFC, only to end up at Nondescripts RFC after a short stay. Some players held the view that the KBL players should approach Mwamba RFC where they would be accommodated amicably, while other team members felt that they had built a strong bond that could see them approach institutions for sponsorship as a rugby entity.\n\nTalks were held with many organizations but it was a meeting between hooker Hezekiah Jerome Ougo and Patrick Odanga, a former Mwamba and Kenya player who was an employee of Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) that bore fruit. Further talks followed leading to the formation of Kenya Commercial Bank RFC who were belatedly admitted in the 1989 Kenya Cup to take the place of the now defunct Kenya Breweries RFC.\n\nThe Club constitutionally changed its name from Kenya Commercial Bank Rugby Football Club (KCB RFC) to Kenya Commercial Bank Rugby Club (KCB RC) at the beginning of the 2010-2011 rugby season. The club dropped the word \"Football\" from its name after Kenya Rugby Football Union, whom they are affiliated with, dropped theirs in the KRU constitution amended on 15 January 2010 and adopted on 26 February 2010.\n\n\nKCB Rugby club playing kit has green as its main color. It is an adaptation from their sponsor, Kenya Commercial Bank, who have light green as one of their corporate colors.\n\nIn the early days of the rugby club, the jersey had green, red and white stripes to portray the bank’s corporate colors. This was revised and when the bank’s corporate identity changed in both logo and color the adaptation was green as the dominant color followed by dark blue and then white.\n\nThe second tier side usually wears kit that is blue dominant in color. They also wear either blue or black shorts unlike the white shorts of the 1st tier side. Currently there is no real distinction in kits between the 1st and 2nd tier sides but, as per club tradition, the new kit of the season is donned by the 1st tier side.\n\nWarm up jerseys are usually polo neck or round-neck t-shirts provided by Kenya Commercial Bank. The colors vary depending on the product being promoted by the bank's marketing department.\n\nIn 2004 and 2007, they won the Enterprise Cup, they have also won the Kenya Cup 4 times, 3 of them between 2005-2007 and one in the 2014-15 season.\n\nThis is a summary of the club's performance over the years:\n\n1992\n• Kenya Cup 3rd position\n• Blackrock Winners\n• Christie Sevens Winners\n1994\n• Relegated from Kenya Cup to Eric Shirley Shield (ESS)\n1995\n• Eric Shirley Shield Winners (unbeaten and promoted to Kenya Cup)\n1996\n• Blackrock joint winners with Impala RFC\n• Impala Floodlit Runners Up\n1999\n• Kenya Cup 3rd position\n2002\n• Kenya Cup Runners Up\n• KRFU Fair Play Award Winners\n2003\n• Kenya Cup 3rd position\n• KRFU Chairman’s Cup Runners Up\n• Impala Floodlit 4th position\n2004\n• Enterprise Cup Winners\n• Kenya Cup Runners Up\n\n• Mwamba Cup Winners\n\n• Eric Shirley Shield Winners\n\n• National 7s Circuit Runner Up\n\n• Participated in Safari 7s\n2005\n• Kenya Cup Winners\n\n• Impala Floodlit Winners\n\n• Mwamba Cup Winners\n2006\n• Kenya Cup Winners\n• KRFU Chairman’s Cup Winners\n• Impala Floodlit 3rd position\n• Mwamba Cup Winners\n2007\n• Kenya Cup Winners\n• Enterprise Cup Winners\n• Impala Floodlit Winners\n• Blackrock Winners\n2008\n• Kenya Cup 3rd position\n• KRFU Chairman’s Cup Runners Up\n• Impala Floodlit 3rd position\n\n• Eric Shirley Shield Winners\n2009\n• Kenya Cup Runners Up\n• Impala Floodlit Runners Up\n2010-2011\n• Kenya Cup Runners Up\n• Impala Floodlit Runners Up\n2011-2012\n• Kenya Cup 3rd Place\n• ESS 3rd Place\n\n• Enterprise Cup Winners\n\n• Mwamba Cup Winners\n\n• Christie Seven’s Winners\n\n2012-2013\n\n• Christie 7s, Driftwood 7s Winners\n\n• \"One-Night-Stand\" Winners\n\n• Chairman’s Cup Winners\n\n• Kenya Cup 3rd Place\n\n• National 7s Circuit Runner Up\n\n2013-2014\n\n• Sports Personality of the Year 2014 Award (SOYA) 2nd Runner Up\n\n• Driftwood 7s Winners\n\n• Prinsloo 7s Winners\n\n• Christie 7s Winners\n\n• National 7s Circuit (Safaricom 7s Circuit) Overall Winners\n\n• Safaricom 7s (2013) - Shield Winners\n\n• Impala Floodlit Winners\n\n• Great Rift 10s Winners\n\n• Chairmans Cup Winners\n\n• Mwamba Cup Winners\n\n• Eric Shirley Cup (ESS) Shield Winners\n\n• Kenya Cup Runner Up\n\n• Enterprise Cup Runner Up\n\n2014-2015\n\n• Sports Personality of the Year 2014 Award (SOYA) Winners\n\n• Dala 7s Winners\n\n• Kabeberi 7s Winners\n\n• Driftwood 7s Winners\n\n• National 7s Circuit Winners\n\n• Floodlit Winners\n\n• Kenya Cup Winners\n\n• Enterprise Cup Winners\n\n• ESS Runner Up\n\n• Mwamba Cup Runner Up\n\n• Great Rift 10s Runner Up\n\n• Kakamega 10s Winners\n\n2015-2016\n\n• National 7s Circuit - Ranked 4th\n\n• Floodlit Winners\n\n• Kenya Cup - Ranked 4th\n\n• ESS - Ranked 3rd\n\n"}

{"id": "6873567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6873567", "title": "League Park (Cincinnati)", "text": "League Park (Cincinnati)\n\nLeague Park was a Major League baseball park located in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. It was the home of the Cincinnati Reds from 1884 through 1901. The ballpark was on an asymmetrical block bounded by Findlay Street (south), Western Avenue (northeast, angling), York Street (north) and McLean Avenue (west).\n\nThe \"Findlay and Western\" intersection was the home field of the Reds from 1884 through June 24, 1970, when the team moved to Riverfront Stadium. The location of the diamond and consequently the main grandstand seating area was shifted several times during the 86½ seasons the Reds played on the site. League Park was actually the first of three parks to stand on the site:\n\nDuring the Cincinnati Reds' first two seasons, the club played at the Bank Street Grounds. Following the 1883 season, the Reds were forced to abandon the park, because the lease had been bought out from under them by the new Cincinnati entry in the one-year wonder called the Union Association.\n\nThe Reds had to find a new location, and they found one less than a mile away from their old park, a few blocks to the southeast on Western Avenue, at the northwest corner of where Findlay Street intersected Western. Thus the Reds remained in the West End, and fans had only to traverse Western Avenue to see the team of their choice.\n\nThe new facility was variously called Cincinnati Base Ball Grounds (or Park), Western Avenue Grounds, American Park (while in the AA), and then its most enduring pre-1912 name, League Park (beginning 1890). The small grandstand for the new park was built in the southeast corner of the block, tucked into the acute angle made by the intersection. Although the diamond would be moved back and forth between the southeast and the southwest corners several times, the little 1884 structure would be retained for 28 seasons, and would come in handy. However, it got off to a bad start. It was constructed hastily, and during the opening day game a portion of the stand collapsed, killing one spectator and injuring several others.\n\nThe park was also very short to right field, with balls hit over the right field fence counting only as a double, until additional land was acquired a few weeks into the season. This increased the distance to right by 50 feet and made the field regulation-sized.\nThe first game to be played at American Park was on April 9, 1884. It was an exhibition game against the then National League Cleveland Blues. The Reds first official home opening day at American Park was on May 1, 1884 against their American Association rival the Columbus Buckeyes. Cincinnati lost that game 10-9 in heartbreaking fashion.\n\nThe season itself saw a good deal of competition between the Reds and the Unions. Although many called the Union the \"Onion League\" due to its lopsided distribution of talent, the Cincinnati Unions were a fairly strong team and drew fans away from the Reds. Once the Union folded, the Reds opted to remain at Findlay and Western, and would continue to do so for the better part of nine decades. Thus the Reds had the city to themselves in 1885.\n\nAlthough the Reds were not participants in the 1885 World Series, their ballpark was. The contest, between the Chicago White Stockings of the NL and the St. Louis Browns of the AA, staged some of its games at neutral sites. The Reds' ballpark was the site for the final two games of the Series, a disputed match that officially ended in a draw.\n\nWhen the Reds returned to the National League in 1890, the name of the park would come to be known as League Park, in reference to the team's original and now current circuit. In those days, the National League was typically referred to in media as \"the League\", since there was only one \"League\" and (for ten years) one \"Association\".\nIn 1894 the ballpark went through some major changes. The owner of the Reds, John Brush, would build a brand new grandstand and add an amphitheater. In order to build a new grandstand he had the diamond shifted from the southeast corner (Findlay and Western) to the southwest corner (Findlay and McLean). Brush chose to retain the old seating as a right field pavilion. This would prove to be a wise decision.\n\nThe name of the ballpark was not changed. Because of the relocated diamond, some historians refer to it as League Park II. The center field area was painted black in 1895 to form a batter's eye screen. Some sources (such as Benson) claim this was the first such screen in baseball.\n\nOn May 28 1900, the ballpark caught on fire, burning the 1894 grandstand. The Reds considered moving to East End Park where the short-lived \"Kelly's Killers\" Association club had played in 1891. Instead, they opted to shift the diamond back to its original location in the southeast corner, reusing the original grandstand, which was not significantly harmed in the fire due to a gap between the two seating areas. They played a month's worth of games on the road, returning to their reconfigured home on June 28.\n\nAfter a season and a half of playing in the charred ballpark, the Reds built what they expected to be a more permanent new grandstand, again in the southwest corner, retaining the original seating, and again with a gap between the seating areas that would prove fortuitous. The original seating had changed somewhat over time, as the middle section no longer sat higher than the rest, and the entire structure was roofed.\n\nThe look of the new grandstand was striking, and the owners named it Palace of the Fans. While the park was still referred to as League Park until 1911, the grandstand nickname is what the park has become known as today.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10399227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10399227", "title": "Mallakhamba", "text": "Mallakhamba\n\nMallakhamba/Mallakhamb (Kannada: ಮಲ್ಲ ಕಂಬ\" malla-kamb\", Marathi: मल्लखांब \"malla-khamb\", Tamil: மல்லர் கம்பம் \"mallar-kambam\") is a traditional sport, originating from the Indian subcontinent, in which a gymnast performs aerial yoga postures and wrestling grips in concert with a vertical stationary or hanging wooden pole, cane, or hanging rope. The word Mallakhamb also refers to the pole used in the sport. The pole is usually made from Seesham (Indian Rosewood) polished with castor oil. Three popular versions of Mallakhamba are practiced using a sheesham pole, cane, or rope.\n\nThe name Mallakhamba derives from the terms \"malla\" meaning wrestler, and \"khamb\" which means a pole. Literally meaning \"wrestling pole\", the term refers to a traditional training implement used by wrestlers.\n\nOn April 9, 2013, the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh declared Mallakhamba the state sport. More than 20 other states in India have followed suit.\n\nThe earliest mention of Mallakhamb can be traced to the 12th Century, where it is referred to in the 1135 AD Sanskrit classic Manasollasa (Kannada: \"ಮನಸೋಲ್ಲಾಸ\") written by Someshvara Chalukya. For about seven centuries after that, the art form remained dormant until it was given a new lease on life by Balambhatta Dada Deodhar, the renowned teacher of Peshwa (prime minister) Baji Rao II. During the first half of the 19th century, Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi learned Mallakhamb with her childhood friends Nana Sahib and Tatya Tope.\n\nCompetitive Mallakhamb at the national level first made its appearance at the National Gymnastics Championships held at the Pahadganj Stadium, Dehli, India, in the year 1958. It was here that the Gymnastics Federation of India proposed to recognize the game and include it in subsequent National Gymnastic Championships.The first National Mallakhamb Championships was held at Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India in the year 1962, as part of the National Gymnastics Championships. They were organised annually by the G.F.I until 1976, when they were disassociated from the G.F.I. from 1977 to 1980, during which time no recognized National Mallakhamb Championships were held. However, in the year 1968-69, the game was introduced in the All India Inter University Gymnastics Championships. \nMessrs. Rakesh & Rajesh Shrivastava, Dr. Bamshankar Joshi, and some other Mallakhamb enthusiasts at Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, India founded an All India Level Association on 21 November, 1980, which was later called the \" Mallakhamb Federation of India\". The first All India Invitational National Mallakhamb Championships were organised by the New Sports Association from 27-29 January, 1981 at Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, India.The event brought in representatives from all over India, who participated in these championships and together they officially formed the \" Mallakhamb Federation of India\" on 29 January, 1981. Since then, the National Mallakhamb Championships are being organised by different state associations affiliated to the Federation.\n\nCurrently all mallakhamb competitions are organised under the rules made by the Mallakhamb Federation of India. 29 states are affiliated to the Federation. mallakhamb competitions cover three varieties: 1. Pole Mallakhamb, 2. Hanging Mallakhamb 3. Rope Mallakhamb.\n\n\nIn this style, a vertical wooden pole of teakwood or sheesam is fixed to the ground. The pole is smeared with castor oil, which helps to minimize excessive friction as the body comes in contact with the pole. The specifications of Pole Mallakhamb are as follows:\n\nThis type of mallakhamb is similar to pole mallakhamb, but as the name indicates, a wooden pole shorter in length than the standard pole mallakhamb is hung with the aid of hooks and a chain, leaving a gap between the ground and the bottom of the mallakhamb. The specifications of Hanging Mallakhamb are as follows:\nRope Mallakhamb was previously performed on a cane but nowadays, due to unavailability of good cane, a cotton rope is used. Performers are expected to perform various exercises without knotting the rope in any way. The specifications of Rope Mallakhamb are as follows:\n\nBetween 25 and 31 types of Mallakhamb apparatus have been tried and tested over the years. 16 various types are recognized presently, but for sport, only six types are used. Mallakhamb is present in the Hind Kesari, Indian Wrestling championship. Competitively, there are three main variations of Mallakhamba. All types are practiced by both men and women, though pole Mallakhamb is more popularly practiced by men and boys and rope Mallakamb by women and girls.\n\nIn this variation, a vertical wooden pole is fixed in the ground and the participant performs various acrobatic feats and poses while hanging on the pole. Wrestlers mount, dismount, and utilize this pole for various complex calisthenics designed to develop their grip, stamina, and strength in the arms, legs, and upper body.\n\nThere are a number of pillars, although the most common is a free-standing upright pole, some eight to ten inches in diameter, planted into the ground. The pole used in competitions is a straight pole made of teak or sheesham wood, standing in height with a circumference of at the base. It gradually tapers to a circumference of at the top.\n\nThe hanging Mallakhamb is a wooden pole that is shorter in length than the standard pole and is hung from chain and hooks, leaving a gap between the ground and the bottom of the Mallakhamb.\n\nIn this variation, the participant performs exercises while hanging on a rope suspended from a support at the top. Typically the rope is 5.5 m long, and approximately 1 to 2 cm in diameter. The rope is caught by the performer in the gap between the big toe and the second toe, along with one or both hands. The performer then ties the rope around himself or herself through a sequence of steps, after climbing upwards on the rope. The performer then reaches various positions called \"Udi\" (\"to fly\"), some of which are imitations of standard Yoga Asana.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36583562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36583562", "title": "Para-equestrian classification", "text": "Para-equestrian classification\n\nPara-equestrian classification is a system for para-equestrian sport is a graded system based on the degree of physical or visual disability and handled at the international level by the FEI. The sport has eligible classifications for people with physical and vision disabilities. Groups of eligible riders include The sport is open to competitors with impaired muscle power, athetosis, impaired passive range of movement, hypertonia, limb deficiency, ataxia, leg length difference, short stature, and vision impairment. They are grouped into five different classes to allow fair competition. These classes are Grade Ia, Grade Ib, Grade II, Grade III, and Grade IV. The para-equestrian classification does not consider the gender of the rider, as equestrines compete in mixed gender competitions.\n\nIn 1983, classification for cerebral palsy competitors in this sport was done by the Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain legion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres.\n\nThe CP-ISRA used the classification system designed for field athletics events. In 1983, there were five cerebral palsy classifications. Class 1 competitors could compete in the Division 1, Class 1 and Class 2 events, while riding with a leader and 2 siderwalkers and/or a backwalker. In 1990, the Equestrian Australia did not have specific classifications for competitors with disabilities. Acknowledging membership needs though, some rules had organically developed that looked like classifications based on rule modification for different disability types. These included acknowledging one-armed riders were not required to hold the reins in both arms, riders with hearing loss were given visual signals instead of audio signals at the start of and during an event, and blind riders, when they reached a marker, were given an auditory signal. When the sport was undergoing growth in 1995, a classification system was established in order to provide a level playing field for competitors. The system developed at the time was called \"Functional Profile System for Grading\" and was largely created by Christine Meaden, who had IPEC classifier status. By 1999, there were four classifications for competitors and 120 accredited equestrian classifiers around the world. At the New York hosted Empire State Games for the Physically Challenged, para-equestrian competition was broken into hearing and vision impaired classifications, amputee classifications, Les Autres, cerebral palsy and spinal cord disabilities.\n\nAt the 1996 Summer Paralympics, classification was done at the venue because classification assessment required watching a competitor play the sport. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 6 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 1 class change. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations, in this case FEI, to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research.\n\nThe fourth edition of FEI's classification system guide was published in January 2015.\n\nGoing forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.\n\nThe purpose of classification to identify the level of functional disability of a rider, completely independent of their skill level. This is because demonstration of skill is the purpose of competition. Steps are taken before and during the classification process to avoid this. Part of the process involves observing the competitor riding and doing a bench press. For this reason, classifiers do not observe a rider on their horse prior to the bench press to avoid assessing skill at functionality.\n\nDuring classification, classifiers look at several things including a rider's mobility, strength and coordination. This is done during a bench press, during training and in competition. After riders are classified, they are giving both a classification and a profile. This profile a number 1 to 39 for para-dressage and 1 to 32 for para-driving. This profile impacts what adaptive equipment riders can use.\n\nEach rider's classification has a status. The available statuses for classification include New, Review, Reviewed Fixe Date - Paralympic Games, and Confirmed. The status of a rider's classification affects their ability to protest their classification.\n\nInternationally, classification is handled by FEI. Classification at the national level is handled by different organizations. For example, Australian para-equestrian sport and classification is managed by the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.\n\nThe classification system in para-equestrian has been criticized by some riders as not fully taking into account disabilities that have fluctuations in a person's regular functional abilities. This criticism specifically related to multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe images below are examples derived from FEI's guide.\n\nThe Grade 1 (Grade I) para-equestrian classification is defined by \"BBC Sport\" as follows: \"Grade 1 incorporates severely disabled riders with Cerebral Palsy, Les Autres and Spinal Cord Injury.\" In 2008, \"BBC Sport\" defined this classification was \"Grade 1: Severely disabled riders with cerebral palsy, les autres and spinal cord injury\" In 2011, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) defined this classification as: \"Riders compete in four mixed disability groups or ‘grades’, with Grade 1 split into two sub-categories (1a and 1b).\" In 2008, the \"Australian Broadcasting Corporation\" defined this classification was \"GRADE I: These riders are mainly wheelchair users who have poor trunk balance and/or impaired function in all four limbs or good upper limb control but no trunk balance.\"\n\nThe FEI defines this classification as \"Grade I — This is split again into two sections: Grade Ib — At this level the rider will ride walk with some trot work excluding medium trot. Grade Ia — At this level the rider will ride a walk only test.\" The Australian Paralympic Committee defined this classification as: \"Grade I: Athletes with a physical disability. Riders with poor trunk balance and/or impairment of function in all four limbs or no trunk balance and good upper limb function. Riders generally use a wheelchair in everyday life. Grade 1 is split into 1a and 1b.\"\n\nEquipment usage for this class differs based on rider profile. In general, competitors in this grade use a snaffle bit. Riders may use their voice to guide the horse during competition provided they do so in moderation. Riders from this classification may compete at a higher functionality class, but they must declare their intention to do so by end of the year for competitions in the following year.\n\nAs of July 2016, the International Paralympic Committee defines Grade 1a on their website as \"Athletes in grade 1a have severe impairments affecting all limbs and the trunk. The athlete usually requires the use of a wheelchair in daily life.\" \n\nGrade 1a para-dressage riders with Profiles 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12a, and 13 are allowed to have a hard hand hold. Grade 1a para-dressage riders with Profiles 7, 12a, and 13 are allowed to use a connecting rein bar.\n\nFor Australian who tried to qualify for the 2012 Summer Paralympics, they needed to have a percentage of a target score \"based on the average overall scores that achieved medals in each grade at the 2010 World Equestrian Games\". For Grade 1a classification, the percentage was 71.78%. Competitors in Grade 1a include Australia's Rob Oakley.\n\nAs of July 2016, the International Paralympic Committee defines Grade 1a on their website as \"Athletes in grade 1b have either a severe impairment of the trunk and minimal impairment of the upper limbs or moderate impairment of the trunk, upper and lower limbs. Most athletes in this class use a wheelchair in daily life.\" \n\nGrade 1b para-dressage riders with Profiles 4, 6, 9, 10a/b, 11a/b, 12b, and 31a/b are allowed to have a hard hand hold. Grade 1b para-dressage riders with Profile 12b are allowed to use a connecting rein bar.\n\nCompetitors in Grade 1b include Australia's Grace Bowman and Joann Formosa. For Australian who tried to qualify for the 2012 Summer Paralympics, they needed to have a percentage of a target score \"based on the average overall scores that achieved medals in each grade at the 2010 World Equestrian Games\". For Grade 1b classification, the percentage was 71.95% for Grade 1B.\n\nThe Grade 2 (Grade II) para-equestrian classification is defined by \"BBC Sport\" as follows: \"Grade 2 incorporates Cerebral Palsy, Les Autres, Spinal Cord injury and Amputee riders with reasonable balance and abdominal control. \" In 2008, \"BBC Sport\" defined this classification was \"Grade 2: Athletes with reasonable balance and abdominal control including amputees\" In 2008, the \"Australian Broadcasting Corporation\" defined this classification was \"GRADE II: These riders are mainly wheelchair users or people who have severe movement impairment involving the lower half and with mild to good upper limb function, or severe impairment on one side of the body. \" Federation Equestre International defines this classification as \"At this level the rider will ride a novice level test excluding canter.\" The Australian Paralympic Committee defined this classification as: \"Grade II: Athletes with a physical disability.

Riders may use their voice to guide the horse during competition provided they do so in moderation. Riders from this classification may compete at a higher functionality class, but they must declare their intention to do so by end of the year for competitions in the following year. Grade 2 para-dressage riders with Profiles 8, 10a/b, 11a/b, 14, 17a, 18a, 27, 31a/b, and 32 are allowed to have a hard hand hold. Grade 2 para-dressage riders with Profile 14, and 27 are allowed to use a connecting rein bar.\n\nFor Australian who tried to qualify for the 2012 Summer Paralympics, they needed to have a percentage of a target score \"based on the average overall scores that achieved medals in each grade at the 2010 World Equestrian Games\". For Grade 2 classification, the percentage was 69.7%.\n\nThe Grade 3 (Grade III) Para-equestrian classification is defined by \"BBC Sport\" as follows: \"Grade 3 incorporates Cerebral Palsy, Les Autres, Amputee, Spinal Cord Injury and totally blind athletes with good balance, leg movement and co-ordination.\" In 2008, \"BBC Sport\" defined this classification was \"Grade 3: Athletes with good balance, leg movement and coordination including blind athletes\" In 2011, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games defined this classification as: \"The visually-impaired compete alongside those with a physical disability in Grades 3 and 4 only.\" In 2008, the \"Australian Broadcasting Corporation\" defined this classification was \"GRADE III: Riders in this section are mainly able to walk without support, with moderate impairment on one side of the body, moderate impairment in all four limbs or severe arm impairment.

There was some debate about whether the aim of the boycott was to end segregation in sport, or to end apartheid together.\n\nIn 1980, the United Nations began compiling a \"Register of Sports Contacts with South Africa\". This was a list of sportspeople and officials who had participated in events within South Africa. It was compiled mainly from reports in South African newspapers. Being listed did not itself result in any punishment, but was regarded as a moral pressure on athletes. Some sports bodies would discipline athletes based on the register. Athletes could have their names deleted from the register by giving a written undertaking not to return to apartheid South Africa to compete. The register is regarded as having been an effective instrument.\n\nThe UN General Assembly adopted the International Convention against Apartheid in Sports on 10 December 1985.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) withdrew its invitation to South Africa to the 1964 Summer Olympics when interior minister Jan de Klerk insisted the team would not be racially integrated. In 1968, the IOC was prepared to readmit South Africa after assurances that its team would be multi-racial; but a threatened boycott by African nations and others forestalled this. The South African Games of 1969 and 1973 were intended to allow Olympic-level competition for South Africans against foreign athletes. South Africa was formally expelled from the IOC in 1970.\n\nIn 1976, African nations demanded that New Zealand be suspended by the IOC for continued contacts with South Africa, including a tour by the New Zealand national rugby union team. When the IOC refused, the African teams withdrew from the games. This contributed to the Gleneagles Agreement being adopted by the Commonwealth in 1977.\n\nThe IOC adopted a declaration against \"apartheid in sport\" on 21 June 1988, for the total isolation of apartheid sport.\n\nThe 1934 British Empire Games, originally awarded in 1930 to Johannesburg, was moved to London after the (pre-apartheid) South Africa government refused to allow nonwhite participants. South Africa continued to participate in every Games until it left the Commonwealth in 1961. The Thatcher government's refusal to enforce the Gleneagles Agreement in the UK led Nigeria to initiate a boycott of the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, from which 32 of 59 eligible teams withdrew.\n\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association, which governs many North American university sports, permitted South Africans to receive athletic scholarships and compete in its events. Most such student athletes were white; one exception was runner Sydney Maree, who later became a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe extent of boycotting varied between different sports, in the degree of contact permitted and the severity of punishment of \"rebels\" who defied the sanctions. This reflected the different political and social composition of each sport's governing international federation (IF).\n\nIn track and field athletics, a motion to suspend South Africa from the IAAF was defeated in 1966, but had been passed by 1970. Zola Budd's time for the women's 5,000m in January 1984 was not ratified as a world record because it was outside the auspices of the IAAF.\n\nIn the 1970 Chess Olympiad, a number of players and teams protested against South Africa's inclusion, some withdrawing themselves, and the Albanian team forfeited its match against the South African team. South Africa were expelled from FIDE while participating in the 1974 Chess Olympiad, finally returning to international competition in the 1992 Chess Olympiad.\n\nCricket had been organised on racial lines in South Africa from its earliest days with the coloured cricketer Krom Hendricks excluded from provincial and national teams from the 1890s. However, the cricketing boycott was prompted by the reaction of the South African authorities to the selection of Basil D'Oliveira, a \"Cape Coloured\" South African, for the England national cricket team in 1968; see the D'Oliveira affair. The 1970 South African tour of England was called off and replaced by a \"Rest of the World\" tour featuring several South African players. The International Cricket Conference (ICC) imposed a moratorium on tours in 1970. There were several private tours in the 1970s and \"rebel\" tours in the 1980s. Participants in the latter were banned by their national federations upon returning. World Series Cricket, run outside the auspices of the ICC in 1977–79, included South African players in its \"Rest of the World\" team.\n\nIn the World Cup, the Greek government banned South Africa from the 1979 competition in Athens. South Africa competed in the 1980 edition in Bogota. The prospect of their appearing in the 1981 edition, due to be staged at Waterville in Ireland, caused it to be cancelled. South Africa did not reappear until the post-apartheid era in 1992.\n\nSouth African golfers continued to play around the world, including PGA Tour, European Tour, and Grand Slam events. Outside golfers competed freely in South African Tour events. The Million Dollar Challenge at the Sun City resort regularly attracted some of the world's top golfers. The Official World Golf Ranking included South African Tour events in its calculations from its instigation in 1986.\n\nSouth African Jody Scheckter was the 1979 Formula One champion. The South African Formula One Grand Prix and the South African motorcycle Grand Prix were held in 1985 for the final time until the end of apartheid. Various teams boycotted the 1985 Formula One race, some teams in this international motorsport boycotting as part of pressure from their own governments, as part of the mounting pressure against apartheid.\n\nSouth Africa remained a member of the International Rugby Board (IRB) throughout the apartheid era. Halt All Racist Tours was established in New Zealand in 1969 to oppose continued tours to and from South Africa. Apartheid South Africa's last foreign tour was to New Zealand in 1981. This tour was highly controversial due to the difference of opinions. Though contacts were restricted after the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 by the British Lions and by France, in 1981 by Ireland, and in 1984 by England. In 1986, though a Lions tour was cancelled, South Africans played in all-star matches in Cardiff and in London marking the IRB centenary. South Africa was excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups, in 1987 and 1991.\n\nSouth Africa was suspended from FIFA in 1963. Stanley Rous, FIFA's President, went to negotiate its reinstatement. The South African FA proposed entering an all-white team in the 1966 World Cup and an all-black team in the 1970 World Cup. This proposal was rejected.\n\nThe South African Table Tennis Board (SATTB), a body founded in contravention to the white South African table tennis board, was substituted for the latter by the International Table Tennis Federation. While the SATTB team was able to participate in the world championships held in Stockholm in 1957, team members were immediately refused passports by the government. It ruled that no black could compete internationally except through the white sports body.\n\nThe South Africa Davis Cup team was ejected from the 1970 Davis Cup, in part thanks to campaigning by Arthur Ashe. It was reinstated in 1973 but placed in the Americas Zone instead of the Europe Zone where other African countries played. It won the 1974 Davis Cup after India refused to travel to South Africa for the final. There were protests at its matches in the United States in 1977 and 1978. In 1977 several countries threatened to withdraw, and in 1978 several did withdraw in protest. In 1979 South Africa was banned again.\n\nThe South Africa women's team participated in the Federation Cup (now Fed Cup) through to 1977. It hosted and won the 1972 edition in Johannesburg.\n\nWilliam Hester, the president of the United States Tennis Association, decided to let a tournament between the United States and South Africa take place in Newport Beach, California in April 1977 in spite of backlash from African nations and protesters due to the apartheid regime. When protesters ran on the court during the match, Tony Trabert, the U.S. manager, \"hit two protestors with a racket\" according to \"The Washington Post\". Hester also let another Davis Cup tournament take place at Vanderbilt University's Memorial Gymnasium in Nashville, Tennessee in March 1978 despite protests from civil rights leaders. Hester explained, \"We do not support or agree with the apartheid policy of the South African government ... But we have entered the draw and, unfortunately, we have to play South Africa - and in the United States.\" Meanwhile, Joseph E. Carrico, the USTA's first vice president at the time and later president, blamed the low attendance on negative stories published by \"The Tennessean\", even after a reporter was escorted out of the gym by the police. According to \"The New York Times\", the event included \"more police (150) than protesters (40) outside the gym.\"\n\nSouth African players continued to compete on the pro tours; Johan Kriek and Kevin Curren reached Grand Slam finals, though both later became naturalised US citizens.\n\nSome elite South African sportspeople competed internationally for another country, after becoming eligible through naturalization, length of residency, or other criteria applicable by the relevant IF. Examples include runner Zola Budd, whose UK nationality application was fast-tracked in time for the 1984 Summer Olympics; and cricketer Kepler Wessels, who acquired Australian eligibility in the 1980s through residency, before returning to South Africa, for whom he played after the end of apartheid. The 1994 film \"Muriel's Wedding\" recounts a fictional 1980s Australian's sham marriage to a South African swimmer seeking Olympic eligibility.\n\nWith the end of apartheid, sports rapidly ended their boycotts and South Africa was readmitted in the International sports federations. The European Community announced its member governments' ending of the boycott in June 1991. India, which vehemently opposed South Africa's apartheid policy and was at the forefront of isolating the country internationally at all levels, ended its boycott in 1991 by inviting the South African cricket team to the country for an ODI series and subsequently allowed the Indian cricket team to tour South Africa for a Test and ODI series in late 1992. The country's hosting and winning of the 1995 Rugby World Cup was a powerful boost to post-apartheid South Africa's return to the international sporting scene.\n\n\n"}

It stands just a few meters away from Stano Pelan Hill and right next to the Bloudkova velikanka. After they demolished Stano Pelan Hill, they built two completely new medium ski jumping hills at the same place, which are used for training. They are HS 62 and HS 80 size.

It is currently used mostly for football matches of SC Bastia. The stadium is able to hold 16,000 people and opened in 1932.\n\nIt was the venue for the first leg of the 1978 UEFA Cup Final, which saw a 0-0 tie between SC Bastia and the Dutch-side PSV Eindhoven. Eventually, PSV won the Final with a 3-0 victory on their home ground Philips Stadion.\n\nThe record attendance at the stadium was set on 1 September 2012, when 15,505 people saw Bastia lose against by St. Etienne (0-3) in league matches. This broke the record set on 26 April 1978, when 15,000 people saw Bastia draw 0-0 against PSV Eindhoven in the first leg of the 1978 UEFA Cup Final.\n\nThe stadium is mostly known outside Corsica for the Furiani disaster, which took place on 5 May 1992 when one of the four terraces fell, causing the death of 18 people and injuring more than 2,300 others.\n\nWhen they reached the semi-final of the Coupe de France 1991-92, the draw gave Bastia a tie against Olympique de Marseille, the Division 1 leader at the time. In order to accommodate more fans, the club board decided to create a temporary terrace instead of the old \"Tribune Claude Papi\" which could only take 750 fans. The new capacity of the terrace was 10,000.\n\nAn hour before the start of the match, problems were already noticeable, such as the instability of the structure. At 8:20 p.m., the whole structure collapsed, with supporters and journalists in the wreckage. Every medical option on the island was exhausted. The victims were eventually evacuated to the mainland, including Marseille. Poretta Airport was quoted as resembling more of a hospital than an airport that night.\n\nOn 8 May, an official investigation began in order to find who was responsible. After the disaster, the FFF decided - after some hesitation - to cancel the remaining matches in the Cup. On the 12th, the investigators came to the conclusion that there had been a number of rules broken concerning the terrace. All these findings led to the investigation's conclusion \"Le soir du 5 mai, il n'y a pas eu de fatalité . (There has been no fate the night of the 5th May)\". Ultimately, at the trial a year later, the main protagonists were proved guilty but were only given prison sentences of less than two years.\n\nSince the disaster, the stadium waited a long time to be rebuilt. The \"Tribune Nord\" was rebuilt in 1997, before Bastia could play again in the 1997–98 UEFA Cup.\n\nFor the 100th anniversary of the club, in 2005, the four terraces were renamed:\n\n"}

It is located in the Hôtel de Ville quarter of Villeneuve d'Ascq and is the home stadium of Lille OSC. Initially named Grand Stade Lille Métropole, the stadium was renamed on 21 June 2013, just after the death of the former Mayor of Lille and former Prime Minister of France Pierre Mauroy.\n\nIn 1975, Lille OSC began playing at the Stade Grimonprez-Jooris, a 21,128-seat facility. When the club began to play European Competitions, the venue did not match UEFA standards, prompting the club to play its UEFA Champions League games at the Stade Félix-Bollaert, home of rival RC Lens, in 2001. Plans were soon made to build a new stadium which would match UEFA demands, but the project was postponed and finally cancelled due to struggle with preservationists who stated that the location chosen for the new stadium was too close to the 17th Century Citadel.\n\nThe club, left without a place to play, moved to the Stadium Nord which was smaller than Grimonprez-Jooris (18,154 seats) and did not fulfill UEFA demands. This situation forced the team, who had qualified for 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, to play at the Stade de France for its European matches. This solution was abandoned after two young LOSC fans lost their lives when they got hit by an incoming train after a game against Olympique Lyonnais.\n\nWhile LOSC was struggling with its stadium problems, the administrative landscape of the Lille area changed. The city was now included in a vast association with its enclosed neighbours, forming the Urban Community of Lille Métropole. The new administration, now in charge of the whole area, decided to launch a new stadium project. On 5 December 2006, an industrial bid for a 50,000-seat multi-purpose stadium, able to receive sport competitions, cultural shows and hold seminars, was launched. The following January, three worldwide construction companies answered the call, each one with ambitious projects:\n\n\nOn February 2008, Eiffage was selected during a general meeting to build the stadium. The contract was officially signed between the two parties on October of the same year. Eiffage was given 45 months to complete the project\n\nOn 10 July 2009, Eiffage received the building permit and authorisation to start preparatory works for the construction at the \"Borne de l'Espoir\" location in Villeneuve-d'Ascq. In December 2009, the final two cities of the Lille Métropole who had yet to sign the building permit joined the project and gave their authorisation. In February 2010, France officially became a candidate to organize the UEFA Euro 2016. The Grand Stade become the symbol of the candidature, boosting its public support. In March 2010, construction of access infrastructure (Subway, Highway, parking lots) began followed one week after by the beginning of the construction of the arena itself. On 28 May 2010, France was officially chosen to organize the Euro 2016. Martine Aubry, who succeeded Pierre Mauroy at the head of LCMU and a big supporter of LOSC and the Grand Stade, expressed her wish to see the Grand Stade given a prominent amount of competition for the upcoming competition. Construction accelerated, with the first brick laid by the Eiffage CEO in September 2010. In 2011, the structure supporting the roof was put in place and constructions of the northern stand was completed by the end of that year. In 2012, the retractable roof, constructed in one piece, was successfully put in place in one day. Despite some legal delays, the stadium was delivered on schedule during the summer of 2012, in time for the 2012–13 LOSC season.\n\nThe total cost of the Eiffage project was €618 million, including €282 million for the stadium, €42 million for additional development such as parking, hotels, and restaurants, and €96 million to ensure seismic standards were met. This latter requirement was introduced in 2011, following a new law passed in the wake of the massive Japan earthquake and tsunami. The cost was spread between the city of Lille (€24.7 million annually for 31 years), the LOSC (€7.5 million annually) and the Nord-Pas-de-Calais regional council (€45 million).\n\nThe cost of the project spurred considerable controversy. On one hand, Martine Aubry and her First Deputy Pierre de Saintignon, in charge of the project, highlighted the Grand Stade as \"a splendid ambassador of the technologies of our region, and a great tool of attractivity\". On the other hand, opponents pointed to a lack of long term viability, since part of the public investments were bound to sporting events, whose results are of random nature. This could lead to some new kind of toxic loans.\n\nStade Pierre-Mauroy has two floors or main levels. The full stadium level or \"Grand Stade\" reaches a height of 31 m (101 feet) and has a total capacity of 50,186 seats including 4,965 business seats, 1,842 luxury-box seats, 448 protocol seats and 326 reserved for the press.\n\nThe stadium has also a peculiarity: half of the \"Grand Stade\" field is situated on hydraulics lift and massive tracks that raise and slide it above the other half of the field in three hours. This creates a second lower level floor plan and surrounding seats called \"Boîte à Spectacles\", where basketball, tennis or music shows can take place. The \"Boîte à Spectacles\" can be configured to have a variable capacity, from 6,900 to 30,000 seats. In November 2014, it hosted the 2014 Davis Cup finals between France and Switzerland, where an attendance record was broken for the highest-ever officially sanctioned competition tennis match. In 2017 it hosted the Davis Cup final again.\nIn addition, Stade Pierre-Mauroy has a retractable roof which opens and shuts in 15 minutes. The stadium is also recognised as a HQE Building with solar panels and two windmills to provide as electrical supply. The stadium is fully accessible by metro stations and road and includes 7,000 parking spaces.\n\nThe Grand Stade received a five-star UEFA ranking. It is expected to significantly increase the revenue streams of Lille OSC, its tenant club.\n\nThe stadium hosted its first rugby union Test match on 17 November 2012 during the 2012 Autumn Internationals, when France defeated Argentina 39–22.\n\nThe knock-out phase of EuroBasket 2015 was held at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy from 12–20 September 2015, including the Final.

The storyline features Michael Oher, an offensive lineman who was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). The film follows Oher from his impoverished upbringing, through his years at Wingate Christian School (a fictional representation of Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, Tennessee), his adoption by Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, to his position as one of the most highly coveted prospects in college football, then finally becoming a first-round pick of the Ravens.\n\nQuinton Aaron stars as Michael Oher, alongside Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy, Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, and Kathy Bates as Miss Sue, Oher's tutor. The film also features appearances by several current and former NCAA coaches, including Houston Nutt, Ed Orgeron, Nick Saban, Lou Holtz, Tommy Tuberville, and Phillip Fulmer.\n\n\"The Blind Side\" grossed over $300 million. Bullock went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. The film also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, which was considered a surprise for the producers and led the Academy to change their requirements for Best Picture nominations.\n\nThe film opens with seventeen-year-old Michael (\"Big Mike\") Oher talking to an NCAA investigator. Then a flashback ensues.\n\nMichael has been in foster care with different families in Memphis, Tennessee, due to his mother's drug addiction. Every time he is placed in a new home, he runs away. His friend's father, on whose couch Mike had been sleeping, asks Burt Cotton, the coach of Wingate Christian School, to help enroll his son and Mike. Impressed by Mike's size and athleticism, Cotton gets him admitted despite his poor academic record. Later, Michael is befriended by a younger student named Sean Jr. (\"SJ\"). SJ's mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy, is a strong-minded interior designer and the wife of wealthy businessman Sean Tuohy. \n\nThe school staff tell Michael that his father has died, apparently due to an accident. Later, Leigh Anne and Sean watch their daughter Collins playing volleyball. After the game, Sean notices Michael picking up leftover food on the bleachers.\n\nOne night, Leigh Anne notices Michael walking alone on the moist road, shivering in the cold without adequate clothing. When she learns that he plans to spend the night huddled outside the closed school gym, Leigh Anne offers to let him sleep on the couch in the Tuohy home.\nThe next morning, Leigh Anne notices that Michael has left. Seeing him walking away, she asks him to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with her family. Slowly, Michael becomes a member of the family. Later, Leigh Anne drives Michael to his mother's house. He sees an eviction notice posted on the door, and his mother is gone.\nLeigh Anne's friends wonder what she is doing; they suggest that Collins might not be safe around Michael, but Leigh Anne rebukes them. She later asks Collins how she feels about it. Collins replies that they cannot just throw Michael out. When Leigh Anne seeks to become Michael's legal guardian, she learns he was taken from his drug-addict mother when he was seven and that no one knows her whereabouts. She is also told that, although he scored poorly in a career aptitude test, he was ranked in the 98th percentile in \"protective instincts\". When Michael appears to be hesitant to use his strength and size while learning to play football, Leigh Anne tells him, as an offensive lineman, he must protect his quarterback. From that moment, Michael improves drastically, well enough to play at the college level. However, to do that, he must meet the minimum grade point average to get in so the Tuohys hire a private tutor for him, the outspoken and kind Miss Sue.\n\nLeigh Anne has a face-to-face conversation with Michael's mother about adopting him. Although she seems unresponsive in the beginning, the mother finally wishes Michael the best.\n\nMichael is heavily recruited by many prestigious schools. SJ talks to coaches and negotiates on Michael's behalf – and his own. When Michael gets his grades high enough, he decides to attend Ole Miss, where Sean had played and Leigh Anne had been a cheerleader. That causes NCAA investigator Granger to look into the matter to determine if the Tuohys took him in and unduly influenced him just so he would play for their alma mater.\n\nMichael runs away before the interview is over and confronts Leigh Anne about her motives for taking him in. He then proceeds to find his biological mother in Hurt Village. A gang leader welcomes him back, offers him a beer, and makes sexually offensive insinuations about Leigh Anne and Collins. When the gang leader threatens to go after them, Michael battles with him and other thugs. After thinking things over and questioning Leigh Anne, Michael tells Granger he chose Ole Miss because \"it's where my family goes to school\". Michael is accepted into college and says his farewells to the Tuohy family. \n\nThe film ends with information about and photos of the real Tuohy family and Michael Oher, who went on to play in the National Football League. He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft.\n\n\n\n\"The Blind Side\" was produced by Alcon Entertainment and released by Warner Bros. The film's production budget was $29 million. Filming for the school scenes took place at Atlanta International School and The Westminster Schools in Atlanta, Georgia, and it features many of their students as extras. The film premiered on November 17 in New York City and New Orleans and opened in theaters on November 20 in the rest of the United States and in Canada.\n\nAcademy Award winner Julia Roberts was originally offered Bullock's role, but turned it down. Bullock initially turned down the starring role three times due to discomfort with portraying a devout Christian. By her own account, Bullock felt she couldn't objectively represent such a person's beliefs on screen. But after a visit with the real Leigh Anne Tuohy, Bullock not only won the role, but also took a pay cut and agreed to receive a percentage of the profits instead.\n\n\"The Blind Side\" opened in 3,110 theaters on its opening weekend, the weekend of November 20, 2009. It grossed a strong $34,510,000 in its opening weekend, the second highest gross of that weekend, behind \"\". It was the highest-grossing opening weekend of Sandra Bullock's career.

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 69%, based on 196 reviews, with a rating average of 6.1/10.

For example, Jeffrey Montez de Oca of the University of Colorado writes that in \"The Blind Side\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s portrayal of adoption, \"charity operates as a signifying act of whiteness that obscures the social relations of domination that not only make charity possible but also creates an urban underclass in need of charity.\" Melissa Anderson of the \"Dallas Observer\" argues that the \"mute, docile\" portrayal of Oher effectively endorses the Uncle Tom stereotype of African-American submission to white authority.\n\nOher was later quoted as saying that \"It's a great story. It seems like they helped me to get to this point. They're my family and without them I wouldn't be here,\" and \"They taught me a lot of things, showed me a lot of different things. It shows that if you help somebody and give somebody a chance and don't judge people, look where they can get to.\"\n\n\"The Blind Side\" has earned numerous awards and nominations for the lead performance of the film's star, Sandra Bullock.\n\nThe nomination of \"The Blind Side\" for Best Picture was considered a surprise, even to its producers. In an attempt to revitalize interest surrounding the awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had upped the number of Best Picture nominees from a mandatory number of five to ten in time for the 82nd Academy Awards, the year \"The Blind Side\" was nominated. However, in 2011, the Academy changed the policy, stating that the Best Picture category would feature between five and ten nominees depending on voting results, as opposed to a set number of nominees. The change was interpreted as a response to films like \"The Blind Side\" being nominated for Best Picture to fill up the set number of spots.\n\nThe movie features 23 songs by artists including Les Paul, Young MC, Lucy Woodward, The Books, Canned Heat, Five for Fighting, and the film's co-star Tim McGraw. However, while the score soundtrack by Carter Burwell was released on CD, none of the featured songs were included.\n\n\"The Blind Side\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 23, 2010. \"The Blind Side\" was available exclusively for rental from Blockbuster for 28 days.\n\nRedbox and Netflix customers had to wait 28 days before they were able to rent the movie. This stems from the settlement of a lawsuit brought by Redbox against Warner Home Video, who, in an attempt to boost DVD sales, refused to sell wholesale titles to Redbox. On August 19, 2009 Redbox sued Warner Home Video to continue purchasing DVD titles at wholesale prices. On February 16, 2010, Redbox settled the lawsuit and agreed to a 28-day window past the street date.\n\nAs of July 9, 2013, units sold for the DVD stand at more than 8.4 million copies and has grossed a further $107,962,159 adding to its total gross.\n\n"}
