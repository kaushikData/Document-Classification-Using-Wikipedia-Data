It covered the local bicycle scene and grew quickly as Vol. 1 No. 6 took on a 5 ½ x8 ½ offset printing format in December, 1961. The name was changed to \"American Cycling Newsletter\" with Vol. 3 No. 1 in March, 1964 issue. The name was changed again with Vol. 5 No. 1 in March, 1965 to \"American Cycling\". The size was changed to a larger format with Vol. 5 No. 1 in March, 1966 to 8 ½ x 11. Peter Hoffman sold the magazine to Leete publications in August 1968 but stayed on as an editor until late 1969. The last \"American Cycling\" titled magazine was the Nov. 1968 issue, Vol. 7 No. 8. The name was changed to \"Bicycling!\" with the Dec 1968 Issue Vol 7 No 9. For three months following the name change, \"American Cycling\" was included on the cover in small print under the \"Bicycling!\" masthead. \"NCCA Newsletter\" and \"American Cycling\" were published 10 times a year, March though December; however, in 1968 -the first year under Leete- there were only 9 issues. Leete skipped the October issue and called it November both to make it more current, and because they were behind in production as they worked on the design change to \"Bicycling!\". After 1968 the magazine went to publishing 12 issues a year. In April 1973 the magazine was acquired by Capital Management Publications. In early December 1977, a team was sent from Rodale to California to meet with the owner and iron out a deal. Rodale acquired \"Bicycling!\" and published their first issue in February, 1978. In 1980, Rodale purchased a smaller magazine, \"Bike World\", and merged it into \"Bicycling!\". In 1982 Rodale bought \"American Cyclist\" and incorporated it into \"Bicycling\". Pricing of the magazine changed over the years as follows July 62 to December 64, 25 cents, March 65 to June 67, 35 cents, July 67 to July 68, 45 cents, In August 1968 with the Leete purchase the price went up to 50 cents, and the covers were changed to full color, the previous covers had been in red and black.\n\nHearst acquired Rodale in 2017.\n\nBikeTown Africa is a project that started in 2006 as a partnership between \"Bicycling\", Rodale Press, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Kona Bicycle Company. The project donates bicycles to healthcare workers in Africa, particularly those involved in HIV/AIDS related work. \"Bicycling\" then documents the impact these bicycles have on the personal and professional lives of the recipients, such as in the May 2010 issue, where Dr. Travis (of the daytime television talk show \"The Doctors\") is interviewed about his involvement in BikeTown (among other things).

Launched in 2016 by media personality LaVar Ball, it has most notably produced signature shoes for the Ball brothers: Lonzo Ball of the Los Angeles Lakers, and LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball of the Los Angeles Ballers. Big Baller Brand has additionally been involved in the creation of the Junior Basketball Association (JBA), which it will fully fund, and both the Big Baller Brand Challenge Games and Big Baller Brand International Tournament, which were a series of Lithuanian exhibition games hosted by BC Vytautas that featured LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball.\n\nOn April 14, 2016, Big Baller Brand announced that it would soft launch by June 2016. Founded by personal trainer and retired football player LaVar Ball, the company was built on \"core family values,\" according to its website. Ball later said that he created Big Baller Brand, which was based in Chino Hills, California, for his three sons: Lonzo, LiAngelo, and LaMelo Ball, who all played basketball at Chino Hills High School when it was established. He also stated that each of the three Bs on the company's logo stands for one of his sons. \n\nUpon its launch in June, Big Baller Brand initially sold T-shirts, shorts, and sweatshirts through its online store. It partnered with a local design, printing, and shipping company, Garment Decor. In 2017, it also began working with sneaker company Brandblack for assistance in its shoe design. To maintain independence from Big Baller Brand, however, Brandblack created an offshoot creative agency Santa Ana Design for the partnership. Alan Foster, a family friend of LaVar Ball, has additionally become a manager and business associate of Big Baller Brand, helping design its signature shoes.\n\nOn March 7, 2017, Big Baller Brand was registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and its official slogan \"Built for this\" was trademarked on February 7, 2018 after being filed for in May 2017. \n\nIn May 2017, Big Baller Brand announced a November 2017 release of its first signature shoe, the ZO2 for Lonzo Ball. The base price of $495 garnered significant media attention. LaVar Ball responded on Twitter to critiques of the shoes' price: \"If you can't afford the ZO2'S, you're NOT a BIG BALLER,\" for which he received further media criticism. In an interview with Colin Cowherd in May 2017, Ball said that if the big shoe companies like Nike, Adidas, or Under Armour want to make a deal with his Big Baller Brand, the asking price is $3 billion. He also said that Baller has sold between 400 to 520 ZO2 shoes. In another interview, Ball described the shoes as \"stitching and glue,\" stating that they were \"not that big of a deal.\"\n\nOn August 31, 2017, it announced the release of a signature shoe for LaMelo Ball, called the Melo Ball 1 (MB1), which was scheduled to be available in late 2017. According to Big Baller Brand, the shoe will be exceptionally light upon a request by Ball himself. The MB1 is currently priced at $395.\n\nOn December 4, 2017, Big Baller Brand revealed plans to create a signature shoe, known as the Gelo 3, for LiAngelo Ball after he left UCLA, following a shoplifting incident in China. Similar to the MB1, the Gelo 3 is also set at around $395. However, his shoes would later be renamed to the G3 Lux during his playing time in Lithuania.\n\nThe company's founder, LaVar Ball, also announced he would have signature shoes of not just his own, but a brand for his wife as well. LaVar's shoes are considered to be named \"LaVariccis,\" while Tina Ball's signature shoes would be named \"The Comeback,\" which was inspired by her recovery from a stroke she had in 2017.\n\nOn October 17, 2018, Big Baller Brand released a cheaper version of Lonzo's shoe, the ZO2.19, priced at $200. \n\nAfter LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball signed their first professional contracts with Vytautas Prienai–Birštonas of the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL), Big Baller Brand saw an increased presence in Lithuania in 2018. On February 9, 2018, Big Baller Brand announced its partnership with the Lithuanian bottled water company Birštonas Mineral Water, a sponsor of Vytautas. LaVar Ball stated that Big Baller Brand would import water from Lithuania to the United States with a price similar to Perrier and S.Pellegrino products.\n\nOn December 20, 2017, LaVar Ball announced the creation of the Junior Basketball Association (JBA), a professional league completely funded by Big Baller Brand that is designed as an alternative to college basketball for high school graduates. The league, which is set to launch in the summer of 2018, is expected to pay players $3,000 to $10,000 per month and include teams from several major American cities. According to Ball, players will be required to exclusively wear Big Baller Brand products, with uniforms, shoes, and other apparel provided by the company. On May 4, 2018, LaVar's youngest son, LaMelo Ball, was confirmed to be one of the players entering the upstart league, while also being touted as the face of the league by his father.\n\nOn January 5, 2018, Vytautas, the first professional team of LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball, announced that it would withdraw from the Baltic Basketball League (BBL) and in its place host five exhibition games to showcase the Ball brothers, called the Big Baller Brand Challenge Games. The games, which took place from January 9 to January 29 and were live streamed through Facebook, featured widespread advertisement of Big Baller Brand, with Business Insider commenting that the company was \"the real star of the show.\" Shortly after the Ball brothers began playing professionally, LaVar Ball heavily invested in Vytautas, helping it pay off its debts and allowing Big Baller Brand to become the team's main sponsor as a result. The team would also be involved with the Big Baller Brand International Tournament and a few other exhibition games involving the Chinese Basketball Association's Guangdong Southern Tigers and the British Basketball League's London Lions during the 2017–18 season, with the Big Baller Brand's founder coaching the team during those events.\n\nOn February 15, 2018, Lonzo Ball would release his debut rap album, Born 2 Ball, under the Big Baller Music Group. The label would be a subsidiary of the Big Baller Brand and would be run by a close friend of LaVar's.\n\nIn April 2018, after previously wearing the ZO2 shoes during a game, Jordan Crawford would be the first professional basketball player not related to the Ball family to look into having a partnership with the company. Crawford also gave the company words of approval for what they're doing. A month later, rapper Quavo of Migos fame would be seen promoting Lonzo Ball's Big Baller Brand merchandise on Instagram, with later reports suggesting that Quavo would be an ambassador of the Big Baller Brand.\n\nIn January 2018, Big Baller Brand was given an F grade by the Better Business Bureau, which said that Big Baller Brand \"has a pattern of complaints\", specifically that many customers have had to wait \"weeks or even months to receive their order\". Some customers alleged that they have received the wrong merchandise or even nothing at all, and that it had been difficult to contact the company. In May 2018, All-Star baseball player Adam Jones complained on social media that he just received his ZO2 Prime Remix shoes after ordering them a year earlier.\n\n"}
{"id": "2009858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009858", "title": "Bullring", "text": "Bullring\n\nA bullring is an arena where bullfighting is performed. Bullrings are often associated with Spain, but they can also be found in neighboring countries and the New World. Bullrings are often historic and culturally significant centres that bear many structural similarities to the Roman amphitheatre.\n\nThe classic bullring is an enclosed, roughly circular amphitheatre with tiered rows of stands that surround an open central space. The open space forms the arena or \"ruedo\", a field of densely packed crushed rock (\"albero\") that is the stage for the bullfight. Also on the ground level, the central arena is surrounded by a staging area where the bullfighters prepare and take refuge, called the \"callejón\" (alley). The \"callejón\" is separated from the arena by a wall or other structure, usually made of wood and roughly 140 cm high. The partition wall has doors for the entrance and exit of the bull (\"puerta de los toriles\") and human participants (\"puerta de cuadrilla\"), although the form, number, and placement of these doors will vary from one bullring to another. \nIn regular places, the wall is pushed outwards leaving splits (\"burladero\", from burlar: to evade, to dodge) that allow the bullfighters to go in the arena and to take refuge but are too narrow for the bull.\nNevertheless, on rare occasions the bull jumps the wall causing havoc in the corridor.\nThe walls also have a type of stirrup or foothold that aids in crossing over to the central arena, and sometimes stirrups on the arena side as well; these are used mostly by event staff if they need to intervene quickly in the case of an emergency. \nThe arena is surrounded by climbing rows of seats.\nThe seats are priced differently according to the position of the sun during the show, normally in the afternoon.\nThe hot \"sol\", \"sun\", is cheaper than the fresher \"sombra\", \"shade\".\n\nBullrings evolved as specialized sporting arenas hand-in-hand with the sport that demanded them. Many of the ancient Roman amphitheatres had characteristics that can be seen in the bullrings of today (in fact the ring in Nîmes, France, is a Roman artifact, though it is more elliptical than the usual plaza), and the origin of bullfighting is very closely related to certain Roman traditions; in the formative years of the sport on the Iberian Peninsula, those Roman enclosures were not commonly utilised for bullfighting events. Back when bullfighting festivals were conducted principally on horseback, the spectacle was a more public affair that took place in the city's open plaza area. It was only later, when bullfights were conducted principally by men on foot, that the public needed a structure to house them appropriately. Not only did the crowd need special seating to view the spectacle, they also needed a structure to contain the general disorder that reigned at festivals during the heyday of such legendary figures as Costillares, Pedro Romero, and Pepe-Hillo. \n\nIn these early days, the circular form was not to be taken for granted. When La Maestranza bullring in Seville was authorized for construction in 1730 specifically to house bullfights, the original plans called for a rectangular arena for the first three years, only later to be changed to a circular form that avoided the cornering of the action and put all viewers at the same approximate distance, the same reason for the elliptical form of amphitheatres. Another circular plaza was begun in Ronda in 1754, and it featured its first bullfights in 1782.\n\nIn the change from the 19th to the 20th century, the Neo-Mudéjar style became in vogue for plazas, involving decoration in visible brickwork.\n\nSince the 1990s, new construction technology allows some rings to be covered permanently or temporarily.\n\nThe primary purpose of the ring is bullfighting, but it is usually limited to some festival weeks in the year.\nIn other times, it may be used as a concert venue as in the \"Rock en el ruedo\" tour of Miguel Ríos or the live record \"Diamonds & Rust in the Bullring\", featuring a Joan Baez concert in the Bilbao plaza.\n\nBefore the diffusion of modern sports premises, bullrings were used in the Basque Country for traditional sports similar to challenges of resistance running. The public made bets on the number of laps the runner could make. No bulls were involved.\n\nAfter the battle of Badajoz (1936) of the Spanish Civil War, the Badajoz ring was used as a confinement camp for supporters of the republic and many thousands were executed there by the Nationalist forces who had just occupied the town.\n\nMost indoor bullrings, especially in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, in addition to being used for concerts, have also been used for indoor sports such as basketball, ice hockey, boxing and lucha libre.\n\nThe most famous bullrings in the world are Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas in Madrid (Spain), widely regarded as the most prestigious one, La Maestranza in Seville (Spain), and Plaza de Toros México in Mexico.\nVillages round the Camargue, such as Rodilhan in the Gard, who also practise 'mise à mort' - killing the bull.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Martin Centre is an athletics center in the northwest United States, on the campus of Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington. Its multi-purpose arena has a seating capacity of 4,000.\n\nGround was broken in June 1964 on the $1.1 million center, which opened in late 1965 as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Pavilion, with a capacity of 3,800 for basketball. The center included a 6-lane swimming pool. The dedication ceremony on November 21 was attended by 6,000 and included the late president's brother, U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. The first varsity event on December 3 was a basketball game against Washington State, won by the visiting Cougars before an overflow crowd of 4,300.\n\nCharlotte Martin, the daughter-in-law of former governor Clarence D.

{"id": "403758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=403758", "title": "Decoy", "text": "Decoy\n\nA decoy (derived from the \"duck-coy\", \"duck cage\") is usually a person, device, or event meant as a distraction, to hide what an individual or a group might be looking for. Decoys have been used for centuries most notably in game hunting, but also in wartime and in the committing or resolving of crimes.\n\nThe term decoy may refer to two distinct devices, both used for hunting wildfowl. One is a long cone-shaped wickerwork tunnel installed on a small pond to catch wild ducks. After the ducks settled on the pond, a small, trained dog would herd the birds into the tunnel. The catch was formerly sent to market for food, but now these are used only to catch ducks to be ringed and released: see ornithology. The word \"decoy\", also originally found in English as \"coy\", derives from the Dutch \"de Kooi\" (the cage) and dates back to the early 17th century, when this type of duck trap was introduced to England from the Netherlands. As \"decoy\" came more commonly to signify a person or a device than a pond with a cage-trap, the latter acquired the retronym \"decoy pool\".\n\nThe other form of duck decoy, otherwise known as a \"hunting decoy\" or \"wildfowl decoy\", is a life-size model of the creature. The hunter places a number about the hunting area as they will encourage wild birds to land nearby, hopefully within the range of the concealed hunter. Originally carved from wood, they are now made from plastic.\n\nWildfowl decoys (primarily ducks, geese, shorebirds, and crows, but including some other species) are considered a form of folk art. Collecting decoys has become a significant hobby both for folk art collectors and hunters. The world record was set in September 2007 when a pintail drake and Canada goose, both by A. Elmer Crowell sold for 1.13 million apiece.\n\nThe decoy in war is a low-cost device intended to represent a real item of military equipment. They may be deployed in amongst their real counterparts, to fool enemy forces into attacking them and so protect the real items of equipment by diverting fire away from them.\n\nAlternatively, large numbers of military decoys, or dummys, may be deployed as an aspect of Military deception. Their purpose is to fool the enemy into believing forces in a particular area are much stronger than they really are. One notable example are Quaker Guns.\n\nFor a defense system, decoys and chaff for ICBMs would mainly work in mid-course: during the boost phase they would be inside the rocket, because separate rockets for each of many decoys would not be practical, while at atmospheric reentry light decoys and chaff considerably slow down and/or are destroyed in the atmosphere.\n\nIn irregular warfare, improvised explosive devices are commonly used as roadside bombs to target military patrols. Some guerillas also use imitation IEDs to intimidate civilians, to waste bomb disposal resources, or to set up an ambush. Some terrorist groups use fake bombs during a hostage siege, in order to limit hostage rescue efforts.\n\nIn biochemistry, there are decoy receptors, decoy substrates and decoy RNA. In addition, digital decoys are used in protein folding simulations.\n\nDecoy receptors, or sink receptors, are receptors that bind a ligand, inhibiting it from binding to its normal receptor. For instance, the receptor VEGFR-1 can prevent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from binding to the VEGFR-2 The TNF inhibitor etanercept exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by being a decoy receptor that binds to TNF.\n\nA \"decoy substrate\" or \"pseudosubstrate\" is a protein that has similar structure to the substrate of an enzyme, in order to make the enzyme bind to the pseudosubstrate rather than to the real substrate, thus blocking the activity of the enzyme. These proteins are therefore enzyme inhibitors.\n\nExamples include K3L produced by vaccinia virus, which prevents the immune system from phosphorylating the substrate eIF-2 by having a similar structure to eIF-2. Thus, the vaccinia virus avoids the immune system.\n\nIn protein folding simulations, a decoy is a computer-generated protein structure which is designed so to \"compete\" with the real structure of the protein. Decoys are used to test the validity of a protein model; the model is considered correct only if is able to identify the native state configuration of the protein among the decoys.\n\nDecoys are generally used to overcome a main problem in protein folding simulations: the size of the conformational space. For very detailed protein models, it can be practically impossible to explore all the possible configurations to find the native state.\nTo deal with this problem, one can make use of decoys. The idea behind this is that it is unnecessary to search blindly through all possible conformations for the native conformation; the search can be limited to a relevant sub-set of structures. To start with, all non-compact configurations can be excluded.\nA typical decoy set will include globular conformations of various shapes, some having no secondary structures, some having helices and sheets in different proportions.\nThe computer model being tested will be used to calculate the free energy of the protein in the decoy configurations. The minimum requirement for the model to be correct is that it identifies the native state as the minimum free energy state (see Anfinsen's dogma).\n\nEver since Joel Barber, the first known decoy collector, started in 1918, decoys have become increasingly viewed as an important form of North American folk art. Barber's book Wild Fowl Decoys, was the first book on decoys as collectible objects. It was followed in 1965 by folk art dealer Adele Earnest's \"The Art of the Decoy\" and \"American Bird Decoys\" by collector Wm. J. Mackey.\n\nWilliam J. Mackey made many trips to Chincoteague Island for the great flounder fishing as well as hunting for Chincoteague decoys. On his trips to the island he called Snug Harbor Marina home. He would send out locals to search for great finds of Chincoteague history. Cigar Daisey was one of the local Chincoteaguers that would help Mackey find all the best decoys that made his collection world-famous. Cigar has told many stories of the many truck loads of decoys he rounded up for his good friend.\nBy that time a milestone in collecting had already occurred with the publication of \"Decoy Collectors Guide\", a small magazine created by hobbyists Hal & Barbara Sorenson of Burlington, Iowa. The 'Guide' helped foster a sense of community and provided a forum for collectors to share their research.\n\nBy the 1970s decoys were becoming big business, at least by previous standards. The death of Wm. F. Mackey brought his decoys to market in a series of auctions in 1973 and 1974, with the star of his collection, a Long-billed Curlew by Wm. 'Bill' Bowman selling for a record US$10,500.\n\nSince the 1960s numerous collectors organizations have been created, specialist books and magazines published, with specialist dealers, and special interest shows around the US and Canada.\n\nThe largest collectors organization is the Midwest Decoy Collectors Association (MDCA)which despite its name is the de facto international group. MDCA is a non-profit, [501(c)(3)] organization which sponsors the biggest show of the year. There are numerous state and regional groups as well.\n\nThe current world record was set when two decoys (Canada goose and a preening pintail drake) by A. Elmer Crowell of East Harwich, MA were sold for $1.13 million each on September 19, 2007 by Stephen O'Brien Jr. Fine Arts, in what O'Brien describes as \"the largest private sale of decoys ever.\" The decoys were part of a private sale of 31 decoys for $7.5 million. Joe Engers, Editor of Decoy Magazine, noted that O'Brien is one of the top dealers of decoys in the country.\n\nAmong other admired makers were the Ward brothers, Lemuel (1896–1984) and Steven, of Crisfield, Maryland. Their career output is estimated at between 27,000 and 40,000 birds, working and decorative.\n\nOne of the most famous decoy makers in recent times is Delbert \"Cigar\" Daisey from Chincoteague Va. Cigar decoys are in high demand all over the country. The best decoy he ever made was a pintail that he made for his wife in 1973. This decoy was featured in National Geographic in June 1980 on page 826. This decoy is estimated to be worth between $100,000 - $150,000.\n\nFish decoy collecting is also quite popular. Especially ice fishing decoys. See also fishing lures.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49050068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49050068", "title": "Economy rate (cricket)", "text": "Economy rate (cricket)\n\nEconomy rate (also known as the Jade Dernbach-o-meter) is the average number of runs conceded per over in cricket. The calculation is (Econ = Runs/Overs bowled). Overs are written as decimals from 0.1 to 0.6, so must be converted into actual decimals (e.g. 0.3 Overs is actually 0.5 as 3 is half of 6) before used in the calculation.\n\nThe economy rate is the average number of runs conceded for each over bowled. From the Bowler’s perspective, extras (byes and leg byes) are not counted as runs, hence not added to his tally of runs conceded in an over, but the error balls i.e. a wide and no-ball are counted and added to his over, which is displayed in his bowling figure.\n\nThe economy rate is more important in one-day cricket and Twenty20 matches than in Test match cricket. The shorter forms of the game (ODI and T20) demand that bowlers (and fielders) restrict the flow of runs from the opposition to give their team a better chance of finishing the game with more runs on the board. In Tests, however, the priority when in the field is to bowl the opposition out and take all ten wickets in both the innings. A bowler's economy rate is normally calculated from their career record, but one might also calculate it for a specific period of time, such as a calendar year or the duration of a World Cup tournament. In one day matches, a career economy rate of less than five runs per over is good. Conceding too many quick runs in a Test match is sure to get you taken off by your captain and replaced with another bowler, while taking a wicket in limited overs matches invariably slows the run rate. Like many aspects of cricket, economy rate vs bowling average vs bowling strike rate is a matter of finding a good balance. In Twenty20 matches, anything under seven runs per over is considered to be good.\n\nJade Dernbach is at the top of the list of players who have the worst economy rates in One Day International cricket with 6.35 as economy rate.\n\n"}

It is the home ground of the Greek club Olympiacos F.C. and is named after Georgios Karaiskakis, a military commander of the Greek War of Independence, who was mortally wounded near the area.\n\nIt was used during the 1896 Summer Olympics as the Neo Phaliron Velodrome, where Frenchman Paul Masson took the three track cycling gold medals.\n\nIt was renovated during the 1960s and was completely rebuilt in 2004 into a 32,115 capacity, all seater stadium, ready for the football competition of the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe stadium was totally demolished and built again from the beginning, facing a different direction. This complete reconstruction took a record time of only 14 months, finishing just in time for the Olympic Games.\nAfter the last deal ended in 1998, Olympiacos is using the stadium once again, on a 49-year lease from 2003 until 2052 and is traditionally identified as the club's true home. In 2002, the president and owner of Olympiacos Socratis Kokkalis, when announced the project to rebuild Karaiskakis, expressed his wish for the new stadium to be also used by Ethnikos F.C., if they wanted, as Karaiskakis is the historic home of both Olympiacos and Ethnikos. Therefore, in the contract signed by the Hellenic Olympic Committee, the owner of the stadium, and Olympiacos, a clause was included, stating that should Ethnikos wish to return to the stadium, they may do so without sharing any significant maintenance or other stadium-related costs, as those are covered by Olympiacos. As of the 2010/11 season though, Ethnikos has not yet opted to do so.\n\nThe ticket sales average higher than any team's in recent decades for the Super League Greece history (rarely have they dropped under the 5,000 mark) and are not expected to drop in the foreseeable future.\n\nSales for national team matches had also been higher, but this was for the most part due to Greece's success in the Euro 2004. As of 2008 and after Greece's disappointing Euro 2008 performance, the attendance of national team matches dropped drastically, leading the Ministry of Sport to change the venue to Heraklion, Crete.\n\nIn June 2005, Karaiskakis stadium hosted a movie theatre (\"Ciné Karaiskakis\") with a cinema screen that is 20 m long and 10 m wide, operating daily between 9 and 11 p.m. (6 and 8 p.m. UTC) and later, every weekend. The movie screen featured movies including \"Batman Begins\" and others. The stadium operated as a movie theatre for the last time on Saturday 13 August 2005.\n\nTwenty-one supporters of Olympiacos lost their lives in \"Gate 7\" (Θύρα 7) of the stadium, after a game between Olympiacos and AEK Athens FC (that ended 6–0), on 8 February 1981; an incident widely known as the Karaiskaki Stadium disaster. In memory of this event, at the tribune where Gate 7 is now, twenty-one seats are black colored instead of red, shaping the number \"7\". A monument on the eastern side of the stadium bears the names of the twenty-one supporters killed on that day in the stadium.\n\nKaraiskakis Stadium is classified as a 4-star football stadium by the UEFA organisation, allowing it to host the UEFA Europa League Final if chosen. It hosts 40 VIP lounges and suites, that can hold up to 474 persons, a press conference hall, that can hold up to 130 seats, 200 seats for press and media coverage, an entire shopping mall, with restaurants, cafés, retail and clothing stores and a gym.\n\nThe stadium also hosts Olympiacos Museum, dedicated not only to the history of the football club, but to the history of all the departments of the multiple European title-winning multi-sport club Olympiacos CFP. There are 10 automated ticket selling machines around the stadium enabling reservations through the internet or by phone. There is no extra charge for the parking area, which takes up to 1,000 cars. Due to its design, the stadium's tribunes have the ability to empty within 7 minutes. The stadium also has restaurants and stores opened during concerts and games and sometimes open with the daily general timetable of most Greek stores and shops.\n\nThe stadium is easily accessed through the Athens Mass Transit System, at the station \"Faliro\", which is about 15 minutes from Athens city centre, at the \"Omonia\" square station and also through Athens driving routes, which is 8 km, about 15 minutes from downtown Athens.\n\nRihanna, Aerosmith, Evanescence, 50 Cent, Scorpions, Whitesnake, Imiskoumbria, Def Leppard and Sex Pistols have performed at the stadium.\n\nAlthough the official name of the stadium is Georgios Karaiskakis, however the stadium is known with other names too \n\n"}

Completed in September 2010, the complex consists of a large hill (K-125) and a normal hill (K-95) jumping tower, as well as three additional smaller slopes of K-65, K-40 and K-20 for training purposes and for use by young jumpers.\n\nThe construction of the ski jumping center was part of a project of the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the Turkey Ski Federation that was needed for the realization of the 2011 Winter Universiade in Erzurum. The ski jumping facility was designed in modernist style by the Slovene architecture firm Atelje S, partner of the co-contractor MANA Original company from the same country, which won the project's international request for tender along with the Turkish Sarıdağlar construction company in March 2008.\n\nErzurum is located on a high plateau at AMSL in Eastern Anatolia Region. The Kiremitliktepe Ski Jump, situated on the highway about southwest of the city, is at the base of Palandöken Mountain that rise up to altitude.\n\nThe center with five ski jumping slopes covers an area of . The two Olympic-size towers has cylindrical structures at the top. The tall main tower has five ring structures on it with the colors of Olympic rings symbolizing the Olympic sprit. Atop the main tower, a restaurant is situated. \n\nThe construction, carried out by the Sarıdağlar company, was completed within ten months, and the sport complex opened in September 2010. It cost €20 million. The venue was renamed in January 2011 after the Turkish telecommunications company Türk Telekom, the main sponsor of the 2011 Winter Universiade. Its new name will be lasting until 2016.\n\nThe multi-purpose facility allows organization of ski jumping events at highest level year around. The high-tech ice-ceramic track inruns and plastic matt covered ski-jump landing area enable equal competition conditions in winter season as well as during the rest of the year irrespectively of the weather. The venue has 10,000 spectator capacity.\n\nThe complex offers accommodation in the hotel near the large hill and in the bungalows on top of the center, and catering in the restaurant atop the main ski jump tower. There is a gym hall for training, and saunas and massage pools for relaxation. \n\nAlso during the time when no competitions are held, the facility attracts local population and tourists for recreation activities and social events at the hotel restaurant and the restaurant atop the 43m-high tower, which offers a panoramic view of the entire city.\n\nThe large hill has a K-point of 125 and a hill size of 140 with a high jumping tower. It has a long inrun with an angle of 35°, a take-off angle of 11°, which is long and high. The slope for the landing is 34.57°.

Women's record belongs to Japanese Sara Takanashi with 110.5 m set at same event on the same day.\n\nThe first international event, which took place at the Kiremitliktepe Ski Jump, was the FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup on December 18-19, 2010. The next competition was the Winter Universiade held from January 28 to February 3, 2011. The venue hosted again the FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup's ski jumping event in December 2011 and Nordic combined event in January 2012. The 2012 FIS Junior World Ski Championships were held at the ski jumping facility from February 22 to 25.\n\nOn July 15, 2014, there was a huge landslide on the Kiremitlik Hill with the result that hills were damaged. On investigation it was noted that the construction completely lacked foundations, the ski slopes and seating being laid directly onto bare earth. Due to this accident, the future of the Kiremitliktepe Ski Jump and also of ski jumping in Turkey is doubtful.\n"}

The arena opened in 1966 and is the oldest arena in the NBA. From its opening until 1996 it was known as the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Arena. After a major renovation completed in 1997, the arena was renamed The Arena in Oakland until 2005 and Oakland Arena from 2005 to 2006. It is often referred to as the Oakland Coliseum Arena as it is located adjacent to the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum. Oracle Arena seats 19,596 fans for basketball and 17,200 for ice hockey.\n\nThe arena has been the home of the Golden State Warriors since the 1971–72 season, except the one-year hiatus while the arena was undergoing renovations. It had been used by the Warriors intermittently as early as 1966. The California Golden Bears of the Pac-10 played the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons at the arena while their primary home, Harmon Gym, was being renovated into Haas Pavilion. For some years before then, the Bears played occasional games against popular non-conference opponents at the arena.\n\nOracle Arena has been home to Warriors playoff games in 1972, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, 2007, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. It hosted the 2015, 2016, 2017, and the 2018 NBA Finals, where the Warriors won in 2015, 2017, and 2018. The 2015 victory was the first time since 1975 the Warriors won the title; however, Games 2 and 3 of the 1975 NBA Finals were played in the Cow Palace as the Coliseum was unavailable. The 2017 victory was the first time that a San Francisco Bay Area team won a title in their home venue since the Oakland Athletics in the 1974 World Series.\n\nThe arena's first tenants were the California Seals of the Western Hockey League, who moved across the bay from the Cow Palace in 1966. The owners of the San Francisco Seals had been awarded an expansion franchise in the National Hockey League on the condition they move out the Cow Palace and into the then-new Oakland Coliseum Arena. The team changed its operating name from San Francisco Seals to California Seals in order to draw fans from both San Francisco and Oakland. The Seals franchise continued to play at the arena after having transferred to the NHL, until the team moved to Cleveland after the 1975–76 NHL season.\n\nThe Coliseum also hosted the American Basketball Association's Oakland Oaks (1967–1969), a charter member of the new ABA in 1967. The Oaks signed San Francisco Warriors star Rick Barry away from the rival National Basketball Association in 1968. The team was owned by entertainer Pat Boone and also had stars Larry Brown and Doug Moe on its roster. Brown and Barry are in the Basketball Hall of Fame. After a 22–56 record in their first season, the Oaks went 60–18 during the regular season in 1968–69. The Oaks then defeated the Denver Rockets, New Orleans Buccaneers and finally the Indiana Pacers in the playoffs to capture the ABA Championship. However, the team was plagued by poor attendance and Boone sold the team following their ABA Championship. They were relocated to Washington and became the Washington Caps.\n\nThe Bay Bombers (Roller Derby, 1966–1973) as well as the Golden Bay Earthquakes of the original MISL during the 1982–83 season and the Oakland Skates, a professional roller hockey team active from 1993 to 1995, all played there. WWE also holds professional wrestling matches at the arena.\n\nOver three decades, the arena grew outdated, lacking the luxuries of newer ones. With just over 15,000 seats, it was one of the smallest venues in the league. Rather than building a new arena in Oakland, San Francisco or San Jose, the decision was made to proceed with a US$121 million renovation that involved tearing out much of interior and building a new seating bowl within the existing structure. The original walls, roof and foundation remained intact, similar to the rebuild of KeyArena in Seattle. The renovation began in mid-1996 and was completed in time for the Warriors return in the fall of 1997 (they played the previous season at the San Jose Arena, home of the NHL's Sharks). Included in the renovation was a new center overhead LED scoreboard and 360-degree fascia display. The new configuration seats 19,596 for basketball and 17,200 for ice hockey.\n\nOn October 20, 2006, the Golden State Warriors and Oracle Corporation announced that the Oakland Arena would be known as The Oracle for a 10-year term. A press conference was held on October 30. \"The O\", as it is referred to, continued to be managed by Oakland–Alameda County Authority (JPA) and SMG. The JPA approved the deal at its November 10 meeting.\n\nOracle Arena has, at least since 2013, been one of the loudest arenas in the NBA. It is called \"Roaracle\" because of the painfully high decibel levels sometimes generated at Warriors games. The Warriors will play their final regular season home game on April 7, 2019 against the Los Angeles Clippers (pending any playoff games if they qualify, which they may), and the team's lease is set to expire by the end of June 2019.\n\nOn May 13, 2007, 20,679 fans watched the Warriors lose to the Utah Jazz 115–101 in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals. This was the highest attendance in the Warriors' 61-year history.\n\nThat record lasted until December 14, 2007, when the Warriors hosted the Los Angeles Lakers and packed 20,705 into the Arena to set a new franchise attendance record.\n\nThe record was again broken on February 20, 2008, when the arena hosted 20,711 for the Warriors-Celtics game.\n\nThis record was set yet again on April 10, 2008, when Oracle Arena hosted 20,737 fans in a Warriors loss to the Denver Nuggets.\n\nBy the end of the 2016–17 regular season, Oracle had sold out 230 consecutive home games, a streak that continued throughout the team's playoff run. Oracle drew over 18,000 people per game for 12 straight seasons.\n\nThe Grateful Dead played more concerts (66) at this venue than at any other, and their December 16, 1992 concert at the arena was released as \"Dick's Picks Volume 27\", along with bonus tracks from their December 17, 1992 concert at the arena.\n\nEarly in 2013, the Warriors announced they would build a new arena in San Francisco and move back to the city. It was originally suggested that the arena would be built on the decaying sites of Piers 30–32 near the foot of the Bay Bridge, but the plan was met with opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views. In April 2014, the Warriors purchased 12-acres in Mission Bay as the site for a new 18,000-seat arena planned to open for the 2018–19 NBA season. The new location eliminated the need for voter approval, which would have been required for the original site, though it had been unanimously approved by the San Francisco Supervisors in November 2012. Because of delays due to litigation filed by arena opponents it is now planned to open at the start of the 2019–20 NBA season. The new arena will be named the Chase Center.\n\nThe seating capacity for basketball has expanded from 13 to 19 thousand in over a half-century of use:\n"}

It is run at Chantilly over a distance of 1,600 metres (about 1 mile), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.\n\nThe earliest version of the event was established at Chantilly in 1852. Its prize money was originally provided by the Chemin de Fer du Nord, a railway company in northern France and the race was titled the Prix de Chemin du Fer du Nord. The first running was a 1,200-metre flat race for two-year-olds, and in the following years it was a 2,400-metre event over hurdles. It reverted to being a flat race in 1856, when it became a 3,200-metre contest for horses aged three or older.\n\nThe Chemin de Fer du Nord continued to provide the total prize money until 1910. Thereafter, it contributed a partial amount each year until 1937. The funding discontinued when the regional railways merged to form the SNCF.\n\nThe present Prix du Chemin de Fer du Nord was created in 1933, when its distance was cut to 1,400 metres. It was cancelled in 1940, and for the next two years it was held at Longchamp. It was run at Maisons-Laffitte in 1943, and was cancelled again in 1944. Another spell at Longchamp began in 1945.\n\nThe race was extended to 1,700 metres in 1950. It returned to Chantilly and reverted to 1,400 metres in 1955. The minimum age was raised to four in 1967, and the distance was increased to 1,600 metres in 1972.\n\nThe event was staged at Maisons-Laffitte in 1997 and 1998, and its current period at Chantilly began in 1999. It is now held on the same day as the Prix de Diane.\n\nIn 2013 the race was renamed in memory of Bertrand du Breuil (1926-2011), the last president of the Societe d'Encouragemment, forerunner of France Galop.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

TRX is a form of suspension training that uses body weight exercises to develop strength, balance, flexibility and core stability simultaneously. It requires the use of the TRX Suspension Trainer, a performance training tool that leverages gravity and the user’s body weight to complete the exercises. TRX's designers claim that it draws on research from the military, pro sports, and academic institutions along with experience gathered from the TRX team, who work \"with thousands of athletes, coaches, trainers, first responders, subject matter experts, professors, and service members in all branches.\"\n\nWhile deployed in Southeast Asia in 1997, Hetrick was looking for a different method of training than the generic push-ups. He uses familiar products–a jiu-jitsu belt and parachute webbing–to create the first version of the TRE Suspension Trainer. In 2001, after 14 years as a SEAL Hetrick left the Navy and attended Stanford University where he earned his MBA. He attended the gym regularly with the hopes of bringing his apparatus to a working prototype by gaining the attention of athletes, coaches and trainers. Hetrick first established his TRX system at the Krav Maga Fitness Club on 1455 Bush Street San Francisco with $350,000 from private investors that he met through connections via Stanford and the military. He began to sell the line of training equipment known today as TRX. Since 2017, the TRX International Day is celebrated on January 25th.\n\nSupporters of TRX Training claim that it can improve mobility and stability, increase metabolic results, build lean muscle, and develop functional strength. Other advocates of the system say that you can't help but use your core for stabilization. Hedrick states that, \"People who like yoga and Pilates tend to like TRX because there are some crossovers. But it's also great for runners, cyclists, or anyone who is an endurance athlete and wants to have more strength training.\" On the contrary, some analysts worry that the instability of suspension straps could possibly result in injury, especially for those with a history of joint or back injuries, or inadequate core strength. Fabio Comana, a research scientist at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise, states that suspension training may work for well-conditioned athletes and gym-goers who regularly train their core, however, it is potentially dangerous for those who haven’t built up their core.\n\n6. ^ All about the TRX Training System here"}
{"id": "50833041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50833041", "title": "Trump National Golf Club Westchester", "text": "Trump National Golf Club Westchester\n\nTrump National Golf Club Westchester is a private golf club in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Owned by Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, the course has eighteen holes, with a clubhouse. Founded in 1922 as \"Briarcliff Country Club\", it later operated as \"Briar Hills Country Club\" and \"Briar Hall Golf and Country Club\" before Trump's purchase of the property in 1996. Trump renamed the club to match his other golf properties, and after its county, Westchester. He had the clubhouse and course rebuilt for its 2002 reopening; the course was designed by Jim Fazio. Donald Trump served as president over Trump National Golf Club LLC (managing the Westchester club) from August 2000 until January 19, 2017, the day before his inauguration.\n\nThe club had its origins around 1895, with Briarcliff founder Walter W. Law's private nine-hole course on his estate, which became available to Briarcliff Lodge guests, and was then known as the Briarcliff Golf Club. In 1922, Devereux Emmet designed a course across the street with eighteen holes, and thus Briarcliff Country Club was founded that year. The name was changed in 1927 to avoid confusion, to Briar Hills Country Club. Briar Hills opened in May 1929 with a new clubhouse; construction began in May 1928 and utilized local stones for the building's exterior. The interior was noted for its design and spaciousness. In 1936, A. W. Tillinghast redesigned the course. In 1948, Henry Law's son Theodore sold the club to local businessmen who renamed it Briar Hall Golf and Country Club. The 1964 Metropolitan Open was hosted at Briar Hall; Jack Patroni won the championship. In 1980, ownership of the club changed hands again.\nHenry Law, a son of village founder Walter W. Law, was among Briar Hill's founders. Among the club's directors were Henry Law and his son Theodore Gilman Law; Gene Sarazen was the club's golf professional in 1923-24, followed by 1952 PGA Champion Jim Turnesa.\n\nAt the time of Briar Hall's 1996 sale, the club had an 18-hole, golf course and clubhouse, seven tennis courts, an in-ground swimming pool, pro shop, maintenance building, and pool house. Briar Hall had been taken over by the Marine Midland Bank, which then sold the property to Trump. Trump bought Briar Hall Country Club for $7.5 million in the foreclosure in December 1996 and ran the club until 1999, until he closed the property to begin its redevelopment. The first general manager of the club, Chief Operating Officer Carolyn Kepcher, later became co-host on Trump's television show \"The Apprentice\". She was fired from the show and management position in August 2006.\n\nOn March 16, 1999, Briarcliff was operating its mayoral election, and incumbent mayor Keith Austin ran unopposed. Write-ins supporting lawyer Richard Mattiaccio prompted a conflict involving hundreds of residents, which led to one arrest. The event took place near the polls at the Village Hall; Mattiaccio had gained supporters by criticizing Austin's weak opposition to Trump's club reconstruction plans. Many residents believed a large project would congest streets with construction vehicles and rip up the landscape. In redesigning the club and its course, Trump hired golf course architect Jim Fazio, brother of Tom Fazio in the same profession. Around the same time, the workmen resodded a village soccer field and assisted in constructing a new veterans' memorial in Briarcliff. He also had the current white clapboard and fieldstone clubhouse built on the property. At one time, due to residents' criticism, the clubhouse was reduced to , eliminating guest rooms and special event halls. It was designed by Robert Lamb Hart Planners & Architects, and included three stories with lockers, a 150-seat restaurant, and top-floor lounge. Other difficulties with the club's plans arose; the village planning board recognized villager concerns over golf tournaments, membership requirements, and pesticide use. And at the time of the club's reconstruction, Trump had three other golf clubs planned, including one in Seven Springs, an area within three towns which would require approval from all three, and one in the French Hill section of Yorktown. Trump later dropped all of the plans, calling Westchester County \"the toughest place to build on the planet\".\n\nThe first head golf professional was Frank Graniero. The club's first nine holes opened on April 15, 2002, followed by the next nine on June 29, 2002. The club had a total cost of $30 million or $40 million, and was claimed to be the largest excavation project in Westchester County's history, with about of earth moved. The thirteenth hole cost Trump $7 million, surrounded by an artificial black granite waterfall, which pumps a minute.\n\nIn 2003 Trump tried to move the Sybase Classic, a LPGA tournament, from Wykagyl Country Club to Trump's club for 2007; the Wykagyl lease would run out in that year. Briarcliff Manor's mayor Peter Chatsky was opposed to the plan; Trump attempted to persuade the mayor to talk to his wife, Jean Chatzky, about the financial benefit of hosting the tournament, adding that village residents would be hired for the event. A Trump Organization vice president suggested donating some proceeds to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library's then-proposed expansion or toward improving a village baseball field. The club's special-use permit with the village restricted the course to 300 people and banned large-scale tournaments from taking place there. The discussion between the Trump Organization and village government stopped that year, however in 2004, Trump submitted a new request to bring a LPGA or PGA tournament to the club.\n\nA storm in June 2011 caused public utilities including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, which made the course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though it did not take corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.\n\nWhen President Obama was in Westchester in 2014, his staff attempted to schedule visits to local golf clubs including Trump National, none of which wanted to close their courses for the president to play. Trump replied to NBC 4 New York's report of the news with a widely circulated and publicized tweet—\"If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!\" In 2015, the club sued the town of Ossining to lower its worth from $13.5 million to $1.4 million in order to reduce property and school taxes; local residents complained because their own taxes would rise. In 2016, the club revised its claims to $9 million, closer to the 2014 town estimate of $14.3 million. In June 2017, Trump disclosed a value of the club at over $50 million, with $9.7 million in personal income in 2016.\n\nDaniel Scavino, social media director for Trump's presidential campaign began working at Briar Hall Country Club as a caddie in 2009, while in high school. He was promoted several times, including to general manager of the club after Trump's purchase. In December 2016, he was announced as Assistant to the President and Director of Social Media. Trump's candidacy for the 2016 United States presidential election affected the club; Horace Greeley High School used the facility for its annual proms, which was protested by its students in late 2015 due to its connection to Trump as a political candidate. The location for the 2016 prom has yet to be changed by student decision. In the following year, it was reported that Pleasantville High School's graduating class was considering changing its prom venue from Trump's club as well. The graduating class voted, 97-44, to keep the venue. On June 7, 2016, Trump gave his nomination victory speech at the clubhouse; he had just won the Republican primaries.\n\nIn July 2016, during Trump's presidential campaign, his opponent Hillary Clinton released a campaign video of one of the club's architects. The architect, Andrew Tesoro, described his dealings with the Trump Organization, where about a dozen employees met him at the finished clubhouse to negotiate reducing his fees. They pressured him into sending a reduced bill, of $50,000 instead of $140,000. After the organization failed to pay the bill, Tesoro met with Trump who convinced him to accept only $25,000 for his services. The Clinton campaign used the story as part of its effort to demonstrate that the Trump Organization harms small businesses. Later during Trump's campaign, in September 2016, \"The Washington Post\" reported that a painting of Trump may be on display at the club. Trump had purchased Michael Israel's work for $200,000 in 2007 through his charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation. According to IRS regulations, the painting would have to be used for a charitable purpose, or donated to a charity, however Melania Trump had planned to hang it in the club's boardroom or conference room, and the artist later stated he believed it was at the clubhouse. Although the painting was purchased at a charity auction, where half of the Trump Foundation's check went to the charity, in September 2016 an IRS director deemed Trump to have violated IRS rules and President Barack Obama publicly criticized Trump's purchase.\n\nIn 2001, annual membership dues were stated to be $9,000 per member or $12,000 for a family, with an initial deposit of $250,000. Before the 2008 recession, initiation fees were $100,000 to $150,000. As of late 2015, initiation fees were down to $50,000. Around that time, many new members were reportedly not charged an initiation fee or were no longer required by the club to fully pay it within five years. Annual dues were $19,400 a year.\n\nThe club is located on about adjacent to Briarcliff Manor's central business district and in a residential area near Pace University's former Briarcliff campus off Pine Road. The property contains \"The Residences at Trump National Golf Club\", a series of sixteen attached townhouses ranging in size from and which were designed by William Devereaux & Associates. Plans exist for an additional 71 condominiums; the site was approved for 87 home sites in 1987. The club also includes a member restaurant, which serves Kobe beef burgers, tuna flown in daily from Honolulu, and Trump Ice bottled water.\n\nCurrent members include former Yankees manager Joe Torre, and actors Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood. Around 2003, members included Rudy Giuliani, Jack Nicholson, Hugh Grant, George Steinbrenner, and Regis Philbin. Visiting players include Ron Howard, Regis Philbin, and Bobby Bonilla, who came for the course's reopening in 2002, and professional golfer Nick Faldo. Other visitors include Michael Jordan, former New York City mayors Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani, and Billy Crystal, who joined Trump and members Bill Clinton and Joe Torre for the 2008 Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation Golf Classic at the club.\n\nFormer US President Bill Clinton has been a member of the club since May 2003. Donald Trump has said that he bought the club partly \"because he knew Bill Clinton would need a place to play\". Part of the Clintons' gift for Bill's 65th birthday was a round of golf at Trump National with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.\n\nThe golf club is Eric Trump's home course. He raises about $3 million each year in an event there for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Mariano Rivera, the New York Knicks, and the Rangers also run charity tournaments there. At one time, Donald Trump had scheduled to be there himself at least once a week. Eric Trump and his foundation received scrutiny from the press in June 2017 after it was revealed that the foundation was funneling money to the Trump Organization through its charity tournaments, held at Trump National Golf Club Westchester and other sites. A few days later, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was reported to be investigating Eric Trump's foundation and its events at the golf course.\n\nThe club was shown on Trump's show \"The Apprentice\", in season one's two-part finale for Bill Rancic's last challenge and season 10's two-part finale for Clint Robertson's.\n\n"}
