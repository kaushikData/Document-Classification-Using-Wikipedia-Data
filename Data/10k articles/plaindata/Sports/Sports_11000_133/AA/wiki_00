It is the home ballpark of the Spokane Indians, a minor league baseball team in the Class A-Short Season Northwest League.\n\nBuilt in less than four months at the Interstate Fairgrounds, the stadium opened in 1958 and has a seating capacity large for Class A ballpark. The facility was built for Triple-A in the Pacific Coast League, which it hosted for 24 of its first 25 seasons. The parent club in 1958 was the Los Angeles Dodgers, who had just moved out west from Brooklyn and moved their PCL affiliate, the Los Angeles Angels, north to Spokane. They stayed for fourteen seasons, through 1971, then departed to New Mexico and became the Albuquerque Dukes.\n\nAfter one year in the short-season Northwest League as a Dodger affiliate, the Triple-A PCL returned in 1973, from Portland, as the Texas Rangers' top affiliate. The Milwaukee Brewers became the Indians' parent club in 1976, the Seattle Mariners in 1979, and the California Angels in 1982. The Indians left for Las Vegas after the 1982 season and the NWL returned in 1983 and has remained for over three decades.\n\nThe preceding minor league ballpark in Spokane was Ferris Field, which was about a mile (1½ km) west, on the west side of Playfair Race Course. Named for city attorney George M. Ferris, its original wooden grandstand was built in 1936. Ferris was a former player and manager for the Indians who secured funding from the Works Progress Administration to build it. A fire in October 1948 damaged most of the grandstands, and it was rebuilt using concrete and steel in the spring of 1949.\n\nEarlier baseball venues in Spokane were Recreation Park (), Natatorium Park (), and the original Twickenham Park.\n\nIn 1954, four-year-old Memorial Stadium (now Joe Albi Stadium) was considered as a potential minor league baseball venue.\n\nFor three seasons beginning in 2004, the Gonzaga Bulldogs used the stadium as its home venue while its current venue was being built.

The movie is an independent film about the life of Major League Baseball player Roberto Clemente who wore jersey number 21. It is the first feature dramatic film on Clemente's life and was written and directed by California filmmaker and Pittsburgh native Richard Rossi and stars two-time Olympian high-jumper Jamie Nieto in the title role of Roberto Clemente and Project Runway Winner Marilinda Rivera as his wife Vera Clemente. Rossi searched for some time and had difficulty casting the lead. \"I'd find someone who looked like him and had those aspects, but they wouldn't be a good athlete,\" said Rossi. \"I'd play catch with them, have them swing the bat. I didn't think we'd find all of those components.\" Richard Rossi appears in a supporting role playing the part of the agent \"Birddog,\" who persuaded Clemente to leave the Brooklyn Dodgers to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Clemente made his Pittsburgh debut in 1955 and went on to be named to 12 all-star teams while leading the National League in batting four times, winning one most valuable player award and two World Series rings.\n\nThe film dramatizes how the Hall of Famer faced racism, dedicated himself to humanitarian work, and died in a plane crash en route to Nicaragua to deliver supplies to earthquake victims in 1972. The “21 Clemente Stories” are 21 vignettes, each from a letter in his complete name using the 21 letters in Roberto Walker Clemente. \"The first “R” stands for Rookie and the last “E” for earthquake, referring to the Nicaraguan quake that led to Clemente's death on an aid mission,\" Rossi said. \"I want people to learn about Clemente, to feel the emotion of the true love he felt for his family, his fans, his team, and the disadvantaged poor he died helping\". One of the scenes in the movie features a conversation Clemente has with a nun.\n\nThe scene spurred several people to pitch the Pope for Clemente's canonization as a saint. Rossi, a former evangelical minister, received several messages of support, including a letter showing papal support from Pope Francis in starting the process from the Vatican through the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, D.C. and from Archbishop José Horacio Gómez of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. \"I've never thought of him in terms of being a saint\", said Neil Walker, whose father was a teammate of Clemente. \"But he's somebody who lived his life serving others, really. So if it would happen, I wouldn't be terribly surprised by it.\" \n\nSome claim the canonization requirement of a miracle was met on July 22, 2017, when Jaime Nieto, who was paralyzed from the neck down in a backflip accident three years after the Clemente film was released, walked 130 steps at his own wedding to fellow Olympian Shevon Stoddart. The miracle was predicted by Rossi as a demonstration of the power of God. \n\nRossi worked on the writing of the screenplay for five years, but his stories originated in childhood. When he was growing up in the West View section of Pittsburgh, he sat in Three Rivers Stadium and watched Clemente advance the Pittsburgh Pirates to the 1971 World Series. Clemente's attitude towards his fans made an impression on Rossi. “He used to say it is most important to spend the greatest amount of time doing things you love,” Rossi said. “He would talk about people in mills spending money on tickets for games, and how impressed he was at that. It was before free agency, but I don't think it would have mattered.” As Rossi recalls, he wrote about Clemente for so many assignments in elementary school (starting in third grade) that one of the teachers finally chastised him for it. \n\nRossi believes that Clemente is just as important to the sport of baseball as Jackie Robinson and thinks that his number should be universally retired like the color-barrier breaking Dodger. He originally planned to make the film with a budget like that of \"42: The Jackie Robinson Story,\" but health problems prompted him to jumpstart production and stop waiting for an elusive check from a wealthy investor. “My doc said ‘these kind of moments are wake up calls…if there’s anything you want to do,’” Rossi said. “I said ‘I want to make my Clemente movie’ which is an odd response. Most people want to go on vacation or tour Europe or something. I wanted to make this film.” The actors and technicians volunteered their time and donated their services to the project. The film is a blend of news and game footage along with scripted and acted scenes.\n\nRossi returned to Pittsburgh to premiere his film to two sold-out screenings at the \"Strand Theater\" on Roberto Clemente's birthday, August 18, 2013. Ron Carter, owner of the century-old Strand, hosted the premiere. “We have done any number of shows here, but this is our very first film premiere,” Carter said. After Pittsburgh's premiere, Rossi exhibited the film in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, other cities, small art theaters, Roberto Clemente High School in Chicago, the Wild Goose Festival in North Carolina, and on DVD.\n\n"}

The venue includes two cricket grounds, which have also been used for Australian rules football, an athletics track and field, three baseball diamonds, two soccer fields, four softball diamonds, administration centers and park land.\n\nIt was constructed for the 2000 Sydney Olympics to host softball and baseball events. The facilities have since been used as a training and administrative base for the Greater Western Sydney Giants from 2010 to 2012, and for the Western Sydney Wanderers FC since 2012. Since 2010 the Sydney Blue Sox of the Australian Baseball League have used the main baseball stadium as their home field.\n\n\nConstruction of the Australian Rules Football/Cricket centre which features two ovals for Australian Rules Football & Cricket, stadium, function facilities and Indoor Practice Centre for Cricket commenced in 2008. The official opening of the centre was held in on 22nd August 2009 with the Mayor of Blacktown City, Councillor Charlie Lowles joined by Chief Executive Officers from AFL NSW/ACT and Cricket NSW.\n\nGreater Western Sydney Giants (GWS) had a presence at Blacktown from 2010 to 2014 at which time the AFL moved the senior team to Sydney Olympic Park, Homebush in Sydney's inner west. This move was supported by the NSW Government which spent $45 million to upgrade the Sydney Showground Stadium at Sydney Olympic Park providing a new home for the Western Sydney AFL team. \n\nAs part of Australia's unsuccessful 2018–2022 FIFA World Cup bid, the athletics track at the western end of the park was proposed to be developed into a soccer stadium named Blacktown Stadium. The stadium would have had 41,000-seat, a figure which would be downgraded to 26,000 post-tournament.\n\nIn 2014, Western Sydney Wanderers proposed to build a centre of excellence, consisting of a training base, offices and a youth academy at Blacktown International Sportspark. As part of the multimillion-dollar elite training base and academy, purpose-built grass playing fields, administration facilities, medical rooms and offices on the southern side of the precinct would be built.\n\nThe three-day match between Cricket Australia XI and New Zealanders in October 2015 was abandoned after concerns over the pitch, New Zealand apparently refusing to bat because of the dangerous state of the wicket. In that match, Ryan Carters (209) and Aaron Finch (288 not out) scored 503 for the opening wicket and the match score remained as Cricket Australia XI 503/1 (dec). The stand easily eclipsed the previous Australian record of 456 set by openers Ernie Mayne and Bill Ponsford for Victoria state in 1923–24.\n\n\n"}

It was named after cricketer Don Bradman, who lived locally and played at the ground in the 1920s. His ashes are scattered on and near the Oval. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000.\n\nIt is an attractive ground, with a white picket fence and an old fashioned pavilion. The Camden Woollybutt is the main gum tree species surrounding the playing surface.\n\nBradman Oval and the nearby International Cricket Hall of Fame (which incorporates the Bradman Museum that operated 1989-2010) are tourist attractions for cricket fans in Australia, and for people visiting from overseas.\n\nThe land on which Bradman Oval is situated was originally part of Glebe Park, granted to the Church of England by John Oxley.\n\nIn 1883 the Bowral Cricket Club was formed and cricket has been played on the ground since 1893.\n\nBradman first played on this oval when he was 12 and scored 29 not out for the Bowral Cricket Club.\n\nBradman became a member of the Bowral Cricket Club in 1925. During his first season in the Berrima District competition, Bradman scored 1,318 runs, an average of 94.14 runs. He also took 51 wickets, averaging 7.8 and held 26 catches.\n\nAnother memorable game on this ground was in 1925 when Bradman scored 234 against the Wingello team that included Bill O'Reilly.\n\nIn 1947 the \"A Glebe\" wicket was formally named the Bradman Oval. Later, improvements were made to the oval through the efforts of Bowral Municipal Council, and Gordon Whatman of Bowral personally maintained the wicket area.\n\nIn 1976 the reopening of a rehabilitated Bradman Oval was performed by Sir Donald Bradman himself in the company of O'Reilly.\n\nBradman Oval is bounded by Glebe Street, Boolwey Street, St Jude Street and Bowral Street. A large parkland area dominated by a stand of mature eucalypts possibly remnants of the original vegetation. A stand of these on the eastern corner impart a sense of enclosure and offer a gateway to the corner site. A line of maturing quercus occupy the St Jude's Rd boundary, and a line of exotic trees are being established between the eucalypts and Bradman Oval. The park contains a childrens playground with old road roller and adventure playground on the eastern side and is the location of the International Cricket Hall of Fame.\n\nBradman Oval is historically significant at a State level through its association with Sir Donald Bradman's cricketing activities, an association which has been reinforced by the recent construction of the Bradman Museum and the name change to Bradman Oval to commemorate national cricketing history. Bradman Oval provides a tangible link to Sir Donald Bradman's formative years. As the former Glebe Park, the Bradman Oval represents the country town parks of the turn of the century which were characterised by a simple planting layout of trees and a few shrubs and reflects a phase in the development of Bowral when attention was turning to the garden environment. Aesthetically, the park's simple layout is further enhanced by the combination of mature Eucalyptus and deciduous trees which enhance the surroundings.\n\nBradman Oval was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000.\n\n"}

He is visible several times in videos of the event, identifiable by his blue and white striped jacket. During the abortive rescue attempt by Bavarian border guards and Munich police which resulted in the deaths of nine hostages and five of the Black September members, Al-Gashey was shot in the wrist attempting to aid a fellow Black September member.\n\nIn interviews, Al-Gashey has said that he was brought up in conditions of great poverty, mostly in the Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon. His family was displaced in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, but always harbored a desire to return. Al-Gashey claimed that the injustice of being forced to live in squalor and rely on handouts while the \"intruders\" were living on his land fostered his hatred for Israel. This led to his joining the PLO in 1967. He said that during his initial training he felt, for the first time, \"truly Palestinian ... not just a wretched refugee, but a revolutionary fighting for a cause.\"\n\nIn July 1972, Al-Gashey was one of several young Black September members recruited for what he referred to as \"special training,\" without having any idea what their target might be. He flew to Munich at the end of August 1972, staying in a hotel and even attending a couple of Olympic events. On the night of 4 September, Al-Gashey met for dinner with the other members of the strike team, along with a senior Black September operative (believed to be Abu Daoud), who briefed them on their upcoming mission and drove with them in taxis to the Olympic Village. Al-Gashey claims that until that dinner meeting, he had no clue that the team's target was to be the Israeli Olympians.\n\nAlthough charged with multiple crimes related to the massacre, Al-Gashey and his surviving compatriots never stood trial. Nearly eight weeks after the massacre, on 29 October, a Lufthansa jet was hijacked by two Black September members, who demanded the release of the three Munich survivors. The jailed fedayeen were subsequently released by the West German government. When they landed in Libya, they were interviewed, with footage of this press conference being shown in the film \"One Day in September\". Jamal Al-Gashey can be seen seated in the middle of the three, between his cousin Adnan (who was believed to be the hostage-taker who shot and killed five of the hostages tied up in one of the helicopters) and Mohammed Safady. When asked directly if he had killed any of the Israelis, Adnan Al-Gashey simply replied, \"It's not important for me to say if I killed Israelim (sic) or not.\"\n\nIt is believed that Al-Gashey has spent the subsequent time since his release in hiding in North Africa. He married and has two daughters. He is the only member of the group to consent to interviews, having given a brief statement in 1992 to a Palestinian journalist. In 1999, Al-Gashey emerged from hiding to give a more in-depth interview in the film \"One Day in September\". Since Al-Gashey believed that Israeli agents were still trying to kill him, he was disguised and his face shown only in blurry shadow as a precaution. Director Kevin Macdonald noted Al-Gashey's edgy, almost paranoid behavior throughout the interview, but was able to convince him that the film he was working on would only be truly authentic if Al-Gashey gave his side of the story. During the 1999 interview, he explained,\nI'm proud of what I did at Munich because it helped the Palestinian cause enormously ... before Munich, the world had no idea about our struggle, but on that day, the name of 'Palestine' was repeated all around the world.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party and was arrested together with a number of other party members with fabricated charges in 1947, when the Communist Party carried out a coup d’état against the ruling Smallholders Party. He was soon released.\n\nAfter retiring from sports he earned a coaching degree and also studied the biomechanics of sports movements.

Competing in sprint events, decathlon and long jump, Balogh achieved his best results in the latter one, winning four Hungarian Athletics Championships titles (1928, 1930, 1931, 1933). He also improved the Hungarian national record, first in 1929 to 7.43 metres, then in 1933 to 7.49 metres.\n\nDuring his university years he participated at the Universiade – also known then as Student World Championships and International University Games –, winning the bronze medal in the long jump in 1928 and the silver in 1930. Balogh was also present at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. Allocated to the Group C in the qualifying round of the long jump, he finished sixth of out then jumpers with 6.79 metres, thus failed to make it to the final round and eventually ranked 23rd. After his retirement he worked as a coach and sports official and earned his coaching diploma in 1953. One of his most notable students is Olympic champion high jumper Ibolya Csák. In 1946 he acted as president of the Hungarian Athletics Association for a brief period.\n\nBalogh graduated from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in 1931, subsequently he worked for \"Óbuda Bridge Engineering Company\" and \"Budapest Electronic Works\". In 1946 he was promoted to Deputy Head of the Energy Policy Division of Ministry of Industry, however, a year later he was arrested by the Communists with the fabricated charge of conspiration against the state. He was eventually released and worked as engineer first for \"Ganz Electric Works\" (1948–1949), then for the \"Metalworkers' Union of Budapest\" and later for the \"Gheorghiu Dej Shipbuilding Company\" (1951–1956). After 1956 he became a docent at the Faculty of Athletics of the College of Physical Education, a position he held until 1963.\n\nAs an architect he planned and constructed sports facilities. Among his notable works are the stadium of Pécsi VSK, the training fields of the Népstadion and the facilities of Vasas SC and Budapest Honvéd SE. He also contributed to the rebuilding and expansion of the sports center of MTK Budapest and Újpesti TE.\n\nBalogh married to Anna Kael, a fellow sportswoman and silver medalist of World Gymnastics Championships in 1934. Their daughter, Anikó Balogh, became an athlete and competed in the javelin throw. Their grandsons, Attila Petőváry and Zsolt Petőváry are former Hungarian international water polo players.\n"}

Its name comes from the town Crolles where Petzl's company headquarters are located but might also be a reference to the nearby cave system of the Dent de Crolles, the exploration of which triggered a lot of technical effort leading to innovation in caving equipment.\n\nThe Croll is normally used in the chest position and in conjunction with an upper ascender or Jumar. This configuration allows a climber, caver or rope access worker to rapidly ascend a rope.\n\nIn 1968 Bruno Dressler asked Fernand Petzl, who worked as a metals machinist, to build a rope-ascending tool, today known as the Petzl Croll, that he had developed by adapting the Jumar to the specificity of pit caving. Following these developments, Fernand Petzl started in the 1970s a small caving equipment manufacturing company Petzl.\n\n"}
{"id": "217324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217324", "title": "Physical education", "text": "Physical education\n\nPhysical education, also known as Phys Ed., PE, gym, or gym class, and known in many Commonwealth countries as physical training or PT, is an educational course related of maintaining the human body through physical exercises (i.e. calisthenics) (citation needed). It is taken during primary and secondary education and encourages psychomotor learning in a play or movement exploration setting to promote health.\n\nIn Singapore, pupils from primary school through junior colleges are required to have two hours of PE every week, except during examination periods. Pupils may play games like football, badminton, captain ball, and basketball during most sessions. Unorthodox sports such as fencing, and skateboarding are occasionally played. In more prestigious secondary schools and in junior colleges, sports such as golf, tennis, shooting, and squash are played. (This paragraph needs to be cited. Where is this information from?) \n\nAn Biennial compulsory fitness exam, NAPFA, is conducted in every school to assess pupils' physical fitness in Singapore. This includes a series of fitness tests (pull-ups/inclined pull-ups for girls, standing broad jump, sit-ups, sit-and-reach and 1.6 km for primary [10- to 12-year-olds]/2.4 km for secondary and junior college levels [13- to 18-year-olds]). Students are graded by gold, silver, or bronze, or as fail. NAPFA for pre-enlistees serves as an indicator for an additional two months in the country's compulsory national service if they attain bronze or fail.\n\nIn Malaysia, pupils from primary schools to secondary schools are expected to do two periods or one hour of PE throughout the year except a week before examinations. In most secondary schools, games like badminton, sepak takraw, football, netball, basketball and tennis are available. Pupils may bring their own sports equipment to the school with the authorization of the teacher. (Again, citation needed for this paragraph. Where is this information from?) \n\nIn the Philippines, PE is mandatory for all years, unless the school gives the option for a student to do the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme instead for fifth and sixth year. Some schools have integrated martial arts training into their physical education curriculum.\nIn Indonesia, students ranging from kindergarten to high school have PE integrated with their curriculum. Kindergarten through grade 3 students have gymnastics. Starting from Grade 4, students are introduced to traditional martial arts Pencak Silat and some team games such as badminton, football, futsal, rounders, and basketball. Starting from junior high school, games such as basketball, volleyball, cricket, tennis, badminton, kho kho, and kabaddi are played. Drills and physical training are taught.\n\nIn Bhutan, the inclusion of Health and Physical Education in the school curriculum was formally endorsed during the 7th CAPSD Board Meeting in 1997. A series of pilot tests were conducted in primary schools from 1998 to 1999. Since the pilot tests were very successful, HPE was introduced as a formal teaching subject in all the primary schools from the year 2000.\n\nIn 2007, a set of revised curriculum books, consisting of a curriculum framework and eight activity books, were developed for use from 2009 academic session.\n\nIn Australia, physical education was first made an important part of the curriculum in government primary and secondary schools in 1981. The policy was outlined in a Ministerial Statement to the Victorian Legislative Assembly by the Minister for Educational Services, Norman Lacy MP on 17 September.\n\nIn the United States, the goal of physical education is to \"develop physically literate individuals who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy a lifetime of healthful physical activity.\"\n\nZero Hour is a before-school physical education class first implemented by Naperville Central High School. In the state of Illinois this program is known as Learning Readiness P.E. (LRPE). It was based on research indicating that students who are physically fit are more academically alert and experience growth in brain cells or enhancement in brain development. NCHS pairs a PE class that incorporates cardiovascular exercise, core strength training, cross lateral movements, and literacy and math strategies with literacy and math classes that utilize movement to enhance learning and improve achievement.\n\nIn British Columbia, Canada, the government has stated in the grade one curriculum that students must participate in physical activity daily five times a week. The teacher is also responsible for planning Daily Physical Activity (DPA), which is thirty minutes of mild to moderate physical activity a day, not including curriculum physical education classes. The curriculum requires students in grade one to be knowledgeable about healthy living. For example, they must be able to describe benefits of regular exercise, identify healthy choices that require them to be more physically active, and describe the importance of choosing healthy food. \n\nOntario, Canada has a similar procedure in place. On October 6, 2005 the Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) implemented a Daily Physical Activity policy in elementary schools, grades 1–8. It requires that all students in grades 1 to 8, including those with special needs, be provided with opportunities to participate in a minimum of twenty minutes of sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity each school day during instructional time. There are many factors that contribute to the ease of implementing and sustaining a quality program, including the involvement of the administration, parents, and community. However, it ultimately comes down to the willingness of the physical education teacher(s) to do their best no matter the situation \n\nIn Portugal, pupils from primary school can optionally join PE as an extra-curricular activity. From middle school to secondary school, pupils must participate in PE classes for two hours per week.\n\nScotland has is a government supported requirement of a minimum of two hours of quality PE in primary and two periods (50 minutes each) in secondary S1 to S4. Recent funding has ensured most local authorities have employed PE lead officers to support the requirement. In fifth and sixth year, PE is voluntary in that personalisation and choice must be considered.\n\nIn England, pupils are expected to do two hours of PE a week in year 7, 8 and 9 and at least one in year 10 and 11.\n\nIn Wales, pupils are expected to do two hours of PE a week.\n\nIn Poland, pupils are expected to do at least three hours of PE a week during primary and secondary education. Universities must also organise at least 60 hours of physical education classes at undergraduate courses.\n\nIn Sweden it differs from municipality to municipality but generally, year 0 to 2 has 55 minutes PE a week. Year 3 to 6 has 110 minutes a week and year 7-9 has 220 minutes. In upper secondary school, all national programs have an obligatory course, Idrott och hälsa 1, containing 100 points of PE, which corresponds to 90-100 hours of PE during the course. (One point should be one hour, but due to holidays this isn't true.) The schools can spend these hours as they like during the three years students attend. Most schools put this course during the first year and offer the follow-up course, Idrott och hälsa 2, which also contains 100 points.\nIn Ireland, you are expected to do 2 Classes worth of P.E.(80 Minutes)This also includes Shower and Changing Times, so averagely 60-65 minutes outside.\nPhysical education trends have developed recently to incorporate a greater variety of activities besides typical sports. Introducing students to activities like bowling, walking/hiking, or frisbee at an early age can help them develop good activity habits that will continue into adulthood. \n\nSome teachers have begun to incorporate stress-reduction techniques such as yoga, deep breathing and tai chi. Tai chi, an ancient martial arts form focused on slow meditative movements, is a relaxation activity with many benefits. Studies have shown that it enhances muscular strength and endurance, as well as cardiovascular endurance. It also provides psychological benefits such as improving general mental health, concentration, awareness and positive mood. It can be taught to any age student with little or no equipment, making it ideal for mixed ability and age classes. Tai chi can easily be incorporated into a holistic learning body and mind unit. \n\nTeaching non-traditional sports may also provide motivation for students to increase their activity, and can help them learn about different cultures. For example, while learning about lacrosse in the Southwestern United States, students might also learn about the Native American cultures of the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada, where the sport originated. Teaching non-traditional (or non-native) sports provides an opportunity to integrate academic concepts from other subjects as well, which may now be required of many PE teachers.\n\nPE is very important to students' health and overall well-being. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that over the past three years obesity in children (ages 2–5) and adolescents (ages 12–19) has doubled because of diet and lack of activity. Since the 1970s the number of children who are obese has tripled. \n\nSHAPE America's National Standards & Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education define what a student should know and be able to do as result of an effective physical education program.\n\nAnother trend is the incorporation of health and nutrition into the physical education curriculum. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 required that all school districts with a federally-funded school meal program develop wellness policies that address nutrition and physical activity. While teaching students sports and movement skills, PE teachers are now incorporating short health and nutrition lessons into the curriculum. This is more prevalent at the elementary school level, where students do not have a specific Health class. Recently most elementary schools have specific health classes for students as well as physical education class. Due to the recent outbreaks of diseases such as swine flu, school districts are making it mandatory for students to learn about practicing good hygiene along with other health topics.\n\nToday many states require Physical Education teachers to be certified to teach Health courses. Many colleges and universities offer both Physical Education and Health as one certification. This push towards health education is beginning at the intermediate level, including lessons on bullying, self-esteem and stress and anger management.\n\nResearch has shown that there is a positive correlation between brain development and exercising.\n\nIncorporating local indigenous knowledge into physical education can lead to many meaningful experiences and a way of learning about other cultures. For example, by incorporating traditional knowledge from varying indigenous groups from across Canada, students can be exposed to many concepts such as holistic learning and the medicine wheel. A unit could be focused on connecting to a place or feeling while outdoors, participating in traditional games, or outdoor environmental education. These types of lesson can easily be integrated into other parts of the curriculum and give Aboriginal students a chance to incorporate their culture in the local school community.\n\nStudies have been done in how physical education can help improve academic achievement. In a 2007 article, researchers found a profound gain in English Arts standardized testing test scores among students who had 56 hours of physical education in a year, compared to those who had 28 hours of physical education a year.\n\nIn Brazil, the physical education curriculum is designed to allow school pupils a full range of modern opportunities, including sports. Martial arts classes, like wrestling in the United States, and Pencak Silat in France, Indonesia, and Malaysia, teach children self-defense and to feel good about themselves. The physical education curriculum is designed to allow students to experience at least a minimum exposure to the following categories of activities: aquatics, conditioning activities, gymnastics, individual/dual sports, team sports, rhythms, and dance.\n\nIn these areas, a planned sequence of learning experiences is designed to support a progression of student development. This allows kids through 6th grade to be introduced to sports, fitness, and teamwork in order to be better prepared for the middle and high school age. In 1975, the United States House of Representatives voted to require school physical education classes include both genders. Some high school and some middle school PE classes are single-sex. \n\nNew technology in education is playing a big role in classes. One of the most affordable and effective tools is a simple video recorder. With this, students can see the mistakes they're making in things such as a throwing motion or swinging form. Studies show that students find this more effective than having someone try to explain what they are doing wrong, and then trying to correct it. Educators may use technologies such as pedometers and heart rate monitors to make step and heart rate goals for students.\n\nOther technologies that can be used in a Physical Education setting include video projectors, GPS and games and gaming systems such as Kinect, Wii Fit and \"Dance Dance Revolution\". Projectors can show students proper form or how to play certain games. GPS systems can be used to get students active in an outdoor setting, and active exergames can be used by teachers to show students a good way to stay fit in and out of the classroom setting.\n\nAnother type of technology that is commonly used in Physical Education is the pedometer. This does not necessarily track how far a person is going, but lets them know the number of steps they are taking.\n\n\n"}

In practice, sling swimsuits provide as little, or even less, coverage (or as much exposure) as a bikini. Monokini types also exist. The sling swimsuit is also known by a variety of names including \"suspender bikini\", \"sling bikini\", \"suspender thong\", \"slingshot swimsuit\" or just \"slingshot\". It is so named because of its resemblance to the Y-shape frame of a slingshot. It is sometimes listed as a bikini variant. When designed for or worn by a man, it is often called a \"mankini\".\n\nUsually, a sling swimsuit comprises a bikini bottom of any style, with side straps extending upwards to cover the breasts, then going over the shoulders and behind the neck or extending down the back. The sling swimsuit leaves the sides of the torso uncovered, while covering the nipples and pubic area. Behind the neck, the straps may join and reach down the back to the buttocks thong or string style. \n\nThe variation of sling swimsuits is a pretzel swimsuit, which has the straps behind the neck and another set of straps around the midriff, instead of straps down the back. Even more \"risqué\" European designs include the bodyform-suspender (by German manufacturer Nixxxe) and other open bust and/or crotchless variants such as the \"peekaboo\" slingshot (by Spanish manufacturer the-Bikinis) and \"ouvert\" sling bikini (by German manufacturer Tangaland).\n\nA sling swimsuit worn by men is often called a mankini. It was popularized by Sacha Baron Cohen, who donned one in the film \"Borat\". The buzz around the film started building during the Cannes Film Festival in May 2006, when Baron Cohen posed in character on the beach in a fluorescent green mankini, alongside four models. A garden gnome in the 2011 film \"Gnomeo and Juliet\" was also shown wearing a mankini, which gets referred to as a Borat-Mankini by newspapers.\n\nCorresponding to the introduction of Lycra into swimwear, sling swimsuits emerged in the early 1990s. They are more popular on some beaches of Europe, including Saint-Tropez, Marbella, Mykonos and Ibiza. Suspender-like straps running between the breasts and around the neck that held the suit up were introduced in the mainstream in 1994. News reports said that within a week of putting the suit on their racks, New York's major stores had sold 150. By season's end, the tally sold was over 3000, at a cost of $24 a suit.\n"}

Typically held annually, the event is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The race was won by Oxford who triumphed over Cambridge by seven lengths.\n\nThe Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the \"Dark Blues\") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the \"Light Blues\"). The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having defeated Cambridge by nine lengths in the previous race. Cambridge led overall with seven wins to Oxford's four.\n\nThere was no Boat Race in 1853 as the Henley Royal Regatta was scheduled for the same time as that proposed by Cambridge in their challenge to Oxford. The universities did however race each other that year, in the Grand Challenge Cup, which was won by Oxford. On 11 February 1854, a challenge was sent to Oxford by the former Light Blue cox Thomas Selby Egan, who had assumed temporary captaincy of Cambridge University Boat Club, despite having coached the Dark Blues to victory in the 1852 race.\n\nAlthough Oxford arrived at Putney as favourites to win the race, Cambridge's style was enough to force the odds to evens. However, in a practice race, the Dark Blues defeated a watermen scratch crew easily and restored their position as pre-race favourites. Both crews rowed in long boats manufactured by Searle. The umpire for the race was Charles Jasper Selwyn and the starter was Edward Searle.\n\nThe Oxford crew weighed an average of 11 st 1 lb (70.1 kg), per rower more than their opponents. Cambridge saw one rower return from the 1852 race in F. Johnson, while Oxford's crew contained two former Blues in Nind and the Oxford University Boat Club president Olliver Meade King.\n\nOxford were pre-race favourites. They won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing Cambridge the Surrey side of the river. The race commenced at 10.40am, with Oxford pulling away from the start. The Dark Blues were clear of Cambridge by the time the crews reached the Crab Tree. By Hammersmith Bridge both coxes were forced to take evasive action as a result of a barge blocking their route. With a lead of two lengths after the bridge, Oxford continued to increase their lead, eventually passing the flag-boat with a seven-length advantage in a time of 25 minutes 29 seconds. It was their third consecutive victory and took the overall record to 7–5 in Cambridge's favour.\n\nIn a speech in the evening's celebrations, Charles Selwyn, who had umpired this and the previous four Boat Races, declared that he was \"no longer young and active enough\" to continue to act in the capacity of umpire; he would be replaced in 1856 by W. G. Rich, the former Cambridge University Boat Club president who had rowed in both the March and December races of 1849.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
