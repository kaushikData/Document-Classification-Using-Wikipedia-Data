{"id": "5568478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5568478", "title": "Biribol", "text": "Biribol\n\nBiribol is a sport, which resembles an aquatic variation of volleyball. It has originated in Brazil, in the city of Birigüi, in the 1960s by Prof. Dario Miguel Pedro. It showed up as a group game and as an alternative to the practice and the learning of swimming. It is the newest sports modality in Brazil and the only group sport genuinely Brazilian, born and instituted inside the country.\n\nIts game is played inside a pool which size is 8m length, 4m width and 1.30m depth (the depth must be this for the entire pool) with a net in the middle of the pool with 2.62m high for the male and with 2.40m high for the female practice.\nThe game space is constituted by 7m high measured from the surface of the water. There is also an attack area, delimited by a line which cross the pool by 1.25m from where the net is in each side. There are lines that delimit the service area, by the end of the pool, 1m from its length limit and other 0.8m from its width limit.\n\nThe ball is specially crafted ball similar to that of water polo but with a smaller diameter. The ball weights approximately 100 grams more than the volleyball one and employs a \"super grip\" surface technology. The official game is played with four players on each side, but there is also the doubles modality, with two players on each side. Biribol is a highly recommended sport for working all muscle groups with practically no injury risks due to its no contact, low impact on joints nature. Biribol is also suited for all ages and genders, and is recommended for people with minor chronic injuries that feel discomfort or pain while playing other sports.\n\nMatches are decided in best-of-three or best-of-five sets of 21 points, when the matches go up to the last set this set is disputed up to the 20th point instead, and a team needs at least two points of advantage in any circumstance to win a set. So if a 21-points set is drawn at 20x20, the match is extended to 22 points, and so on. \nThe ball can be touched with any part of the player's body, with open or closed hands. The pool's inside borders are neutral, meaning the ball is normally in play after touching them, points are scored when the ball hits the water in the opponents' side or the opponent team commits a fault. As in volleyball, each team can contact the ball no more than three times before the ball crosses the net, while consecutive contacts must be made by different players - except for contacts while blocking, which are not counted. Players also cannot touch the net or they commit a fault and a point is awarded to the opponent team. Unique to the sport is that there is no penetration under \"and\" over the net - it is even allowed to block a set being executed in the opponents' side -, the possibility of blocking serves and how there is no lifting (carrying) faults during spikes.\n\nWith its fast moving, highly accurate ball and 'closed quarters' action, Biribol is also an extremely competitive sport and enjoys a popularity similar to or greater than water volleyball in southern Brazil. There is currently a Brazilian National League with teams from São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias and Paraná. There are many stages held in different cities of the country, and the Brazilian champion is known in the end of the year, after computing all points of the season. The sport has been reckoned officially in the state of São Paulo, and grows rapidly in the country.\n\n"}
{"id": "5221888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5221888", "title": "Cardines Field", "text": "Cardines Field\n\nCardines Field is a baseball stadium located at 20 America’s Cup Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island. It is believed to be one of the oldest ballparks in the United States and has been called \"a small urban gem of a ballpark\". The field serves as a buffer between the residential and commercial sections of an older part of Newport. The oddly shaped outfield fence and dimensions are created by the close proximity of residential housing, while the spectator side of the park is contained by America's Cup Avenue and West Marlborough Street. Originally called Basin Field, references to the field can be found as early as 1893. At that time, the property was used by local railroads as a drainage and supply basin for steam engines. Complaints from neighbors about the stagnant water and mosquitoes prompted the drainage of the basin area, permitting baseball to be played. A local historical debate continues as to whether baseball was played prior to 1900, making Cardines one of the oldest existing ballparks in the country, or if play didn't begin until 1908, the earliest documented proof of stadium construction.\n\nThe Basin Field ballpark was later renamed for Bernardo Cardines, a Newport baseball player who was Newport's first citizen to die in World War I. Today, the ballpark continues to be the home of the historic Sunset League, as well as the Newport Gulls of the New England Collegiate Baseball League.\n\nBuilt for unofficial sandlot baseball games by railroad workers from the adjacent Old Colony Division of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Line, the field hosted many barnstorming all-stars, including Negro League teams like the Baltimore Elite Giants, Boston Royal Giants and the New York Black Yankees. Satchel Paige once played at Cardines. The original backstop dates back to as early as 1908, when the city organized its first six-team league at the park.\n\nCardines Field is a smaller cousin of other notable ballparks of that era, such as Ebbets Field, Fenway Park and Wrigley Field, with a stone facade and wooden bleachers with unique outfield angles. The exterior's elliptical arches reflect the facade of the original Yankee Stadium.\n\nIn 1936, the city of Newport took over ownership. Stone and concrete bleachers were built along the third-base line by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1936-1937. The plaque at the entrance that reads \"1937\" refers to this date. The current grandstand was built by the WPA following the devastating hurricane of 1938. The distinctive curving grandstand section behind home plate was built in 1939. Over the coming decades, the park continued to grow through construction projects to increase capacity, eventually creating the patchwork, overlapping stadium seen today.\n\nDuring World War II, many former professional ball players were stationed at Naval Station Newport. Many of these players, including Yogi Berra, Phil Rizzuto, and Bob Feller participated in Newport's George Donnelly Sunset League, an amateur league formed in 1919. Wednesday night all-star games drew thousands and required construction of temporary bleachers in the outfield. The Sunset League was named because games began at 5:30 p.m. and ended at dusk, prior to the addition of lights at the park. It is the oldest continuous amateur baseball league in the country. With black players such as Larry Doby and Luke Easter, the Sunset League was integrated several years before Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. The league continues today as key chapter of Cardines' history.\n\nThe Sunset League still plays a full schedule throughout the summer, though the park's lighting system now permits games to go well beyond dusk. The field is home to baseball games for Rogers High School, Newport's Babe Ruth League, the historic Sunset League, Newport's American Legion team, Salve Regina University, Naval Academy Preparatory School and the Newport Gulls of the New England Collegiate Baseball League. In the January 18, 2004 edition of Baseball America, Cardines Field was chosen as one of the top five locations in America to play college summer baseball, in response to the jump in reputation the Gulls brought to the park.\n\nWhile most teams playing at Cardines average attendance in the dozens or, at most, a few hundred per game, the Newport Gulls, since moving to Newport in 2001, have helped to bring the field back to its former glory days of the mid-20th century, attracting hundreds of fans every night. During the 2004 regular and playoff seasons alone, the Gulls attracted over 50,000 fans through just 26 home games, often with sellout crowds. Following the 2010 season, the Gulls set a team and NECBL record for regular season home attendance, totaling 45,683 after 21 games.\n\nRenovation work began in 2000 with funds from a matching $500,000 grant from the state Department of Environmental Management and the formation of the Friends of Cardines Field Foundation. In recent years, the grandstands, concession operation, and bathrooms have been renovated as part of the project, along with the addition of a state-of-the-art field lighting system. The winter of 2005 - 2006 saw the entire outfield and infield replaced among other improvements, including the addition of a fully functional drainage system and new outfield fence, all at the cost of an additional half million dollars.\n\nThe Newport Gulls also have necessitated the expansion of concession equipment, in addition to the renovation of a team office, storage rooms, souvenir stand, ticket booth, scoreboard, and public address system, much of which has been covered by the ongoing restoration project led by the city's Parks and Recreation Department, the Gulls former ownership, and Roger Williams University Professor Jeffery Staats. The most recent improvements have been to upgrade the stadium's broadcasting abilities, with the addition of high speed Internet and phone lines, camera positions, and a control room below the pressbox for use by the Tigers TV Crew, the volunteer production crew who work with the Gulls to produce games.\n\nThe park today has changed drastically in upkeep and appearance from that of the recent past. As early as a decade ago, some in the city of Newport had proposed for a then dilapidated Cardines Field to be demolished in order to expand parking in the cramped downtown area, a mere block in each direction from the waterfront to the West, commercial and tourist center to the South, and world-famous historical district to the East.\n\nFuture projects at Cardines include: concluding outfield fence replacement via a state grant, widening and lengthening of the hockey-style side-by-side dugouts, the additions of a locker room and an umpire's room, and further restoration of bleachers, framework, trim, and other facets. The removal of a large, rundown private warehouse which makes up the right field fouline has been discussed for some time, though no official plans have been announced.\n\n\n"}

The ground is the home of Dartford Cricket Club, one of the oldest cricket clubs in the United Kingdom. The ground was established at the beginning of the 20th century and has been used as a first-class cricket venue by Kent County Cricket Club.\n\nThe ground is located around south-east of Dartford town centre and is one f the few open spaces which remain on what was once the Dartford Brent. The A296 road runs along the western side of the ground with the A225 road to the south and the A282 Dartford Crossing approach road running east of the ground.\n\nCricket has been played at Dartford since at least the early 18th century and Dartford Cricket Club is one of the oldest established cricket clubs in England. Cricket was first played on Dartford Brent, an area of common land to the east of the town on which the modern Hesketh Park ground is situated. The earliest known match between two county sides took place on the Brent in 1709 with a Kent team playing one from Surrey. After the end of the 18th century matches moved to Bowman's Lodge on Dartford Heath before Hesketh Park was established at the start of the 20th century.\n\nAn area of municipal park land was established at Hesketh Park in 1904 as a result of a donation by local businessman Everand Hesketh. The site was expanded in 1905 when Hesketh purchased land adjacent to the park to build a sports ground which includes the cricket ground. The first match on the ground was held in 1905, with Hesketh bowling the first over. The ground is owned by Dartford Borough Council and operated by the council and Dartford Cricket Club.\n\nKent County Cricket Club used Hesketh Park for First XI fixtures between 1956 and 1990. The first first-class cricket match on the ground took place in May 1956 and saw Kent play Essex. A total of 33 first-class matches were held on the ground, with Kent playing a County Championship fixture at Dartford in most seasons from 1956 until 1990. In 1963 the county played twice at the ground, a Championship match against Northants followed by a match against the Pakistan Eaglets – a touring side of younger Pakistani cricketers. The final first-class match on the ground was held in August 1990 with Leicestershire as the opposition.\n\nKent have also played two List-A cricket matches on the ground, both against Essex. The first match took place in the 1978 Benson & Hedges Cup and the second in the 1981 tournament. The Kent Second XI also used the ground 40 times between 1947, when they played Norfolk in the Minor Counties Championship, and 1995 when it was used in the Second XI Championship.\n\nDuring the 1973 Women's Cricket World Cup the ground was used for a single Women's One Day International. Australia women beat New Zealand women on the ground with Australian opening batsman Bev Wilson scoring a half-century.\n\nIn local domestic cricket the ground has been the home venue of Dartford Cricket Club since it was established in 1905. The club plays in the Kent Cricket League. The pavilion on the ground was replaced in 2015, the new building replacing one which had been built in the 1980s to replace the original pavilion which had been built when the ground was established but was later destroyed by fire. The pavilion project was part funded by Dartford Borough Council with a grant of £1 million. A new area of cricket nets was built on the ground as part of the project. The ground has also hosted fixtures involving Lashings World XI.\n\nA total of 33 first-class and two List A matches were held on the ground, all with Kent as the home team.\nIn the two List A matches on the ground the highest team score was 226/4 scored by Kent chasing an Essex score of 222 in 1978. The highest individual score was 79 not out, scored by Bob Woolmer for Kent in 1981 in another successful run chase against Essex. The highest women's individual score on the ground was 50 runs scored by Bev Wilson.\n\nHesketh Park is the home of Dartford bowls club. Grass and hard tennis courts are also available in the wider park.\n\n"}

The penalty associated with the infraction is the advancing of the ball five yards and a replay of the down.\n\nIn gridiron football, offside is a foul in which a player is on the wrong side of the line of scrimmage when the ball is snapped. This foul occurs simultaneously with the snap. Unlike offensive players, defensive players are not compelled to come to a set position before the snap. If a defender jumps across the line but gets back to his side before the snap, there is no foul. In the case of an offside foul, play is not stopped, and the foul is announced at the conclusion of the play. Media covering the games calls it a \"free play\" for the offense, as the non-offending team may decline the penalty and take the yardage gained on the play (and when the play works against them, like a turnover to the opposing team, the non-offending team can accept the penalty and retake possession of the ball)—unlike in the case of a false start foul against the offense, whereupon the play is immediately stopped by the officials.\n\nThis foul is almost always committed by the defense (any offensive player that moves into the neutral zone after setting would be charged with a false start). However, it is possible for the offense to commit this foul. If an offensive player lines up in the neutral zone, an offside foul will be called against the offense.\n\nPrior to 1925, a call of offside against a defensive unit brought with it an automatic first down in addition to a five-yard advancement of the ball for the offense. However, a December 1924 meeting of the Football Coaches' Association of America spurred a change of rules for the 1925 season eliminating the provision for an automatic first down, while leaving the five yard penalty intact.\n\nThe penalty for violation remains 5 yards at most levels of professional and amateur play.\n"}

It is the home ground of Raith Rovers, who have played there since 1891. , the ground has an all-seated capacity of .\n\nThe ground was opened in 1891 (this is actually when Raith started using it, it has been around longer) and seats . It is located in Kirkcaldy, Fife. The park can clearly be seen from the railway line on the route between Edinburgh and Aberdeen.\n\nThe unusual L-shaped main stand that houses the players dressing facilities and the supporters lounge was designed by the renowned \"Grandstand\" architect Archibald Leitch and was built with part funding from the sale of Alex James to Preston North End in 1925. Other funding came from a loan scheme that was not finally paid off until 1946. The terracing was open to the elements except for a covered enclosure affectionately known as the \"coo shed\" which stood opposite the main stand and ran approximately two-thirds of the length of the pitch. The ash and railway sleeper terracing which surrounded all sides of the ground except the stand enclosure was replaced with new concrete works in the north and south enclosures behind the goals. This work being carried out in the 1950s when a shed was erected at either end to give partial covering to the supporters. Typical of several football grounds of the time the club sold advertising space on the pitched asbestos roofs of the covered areas to companies such as R'bt Hutchison & Co (Youma Bread), The Evening Dispatch, Nelsons Cigarettes and Barnett & Morton Ltd, the local ironmonger who had erected the sheds. Shortly after the above terrace was upgraded, four large floodlighting pylons similar to those at Tynecastle Park were erected to allow evening midweek fixtures to be played all year round. Most of the cost of the above work was covered (as had become the norm) by the sale of assets, the most notable of those being Jackie Stewart to Birmingham City, Jim Baxter to Rangers and Jimmy MacEwan to Aston Villa, the latter deal also leading to Villa travelling north to play in the first match under the new lights.\n\nBarr Construction were appointed to redevelop the stadium. Two 3,370 seat stands with inbuilt floodlight towers behind each goal and a 1000-seat stand to join onto the 1980s railway (new) stand were erected. This work brought the ground capacity up to a creditable 10,700 all seater. During all of the above changes the main pavilion remained totally unchanged with its asbestos roof, concrete steps and wooden seats and benches. A new metal roof and plastic seating were finally installed in 1999 which slightly reduced the spectator capacity to 8,473. As of the 2017/2018 season the railway stand is to be converted into a standing support section adding to the total capacity which will become 11198.\n\nIn the 2018 close season, a synthetic pitch was laid.\n\nThe ground is often referred to by fans as the \"San Starko\", in jesting reference to the San Siro.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52378181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52378181", "title": "United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal", "text": "United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal\n\nA sexual abuse scandal involving the abuse of young players at football clubs in the United Kingdom began in mid-November 2016. The revelations began when former professional footballers waived their rights to anonymity and talked publicly about being abused by former coaches and scouts in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. This led to a surge of further allegations, as well as allegations that some clubs had covered them up.\n\nEchoing similar revelations in the 1990s, the initial 2016 allegations centred on abuse of young players at Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City due to the clubs' associations with Barry Bennell (previously convicted of sexual abuse offences in the UK and US) who, on 29 November 2016, was charged with new offences. Allegations were also made against George Ormond, a former Newcastle United youth coach and scout (who also had previous convictions), former Chelsea scout Eddie Heath, and former Southampton and Peterborough coach Bob Higgins. In early December 2016, allegations about former youth coaches and scouts in Northern Ireland and Scotland also started to emerge.\n\nWithin a month of the initial reporting, the Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, several football clubs and over 20 UK police forces had established various inquiries and investigations and over 350 alleged victims had come forward. By July 2018, 300 suspects were reported to have been identified by 849 alleged victims, with 2,807 incidents involving 340 different clubs. These have led to 13 individuals being charged with historical sexual abuse, of which nine have been tried: seven - Bennell, Ormond, William Toner, Michael Coleman, Jim McCafferty, Robert Smith and James Torbett - have been convicted and jailed; Higgins has been found guilty of one charge and faces a retrial on 48 further charges; Paul McCann was cleared. Gerald King is currently on trial, two await trial, and one has since died. Other allegations involve individuals who had died prior to the revelations.\n\nIn July 2018, the FA's independent inquiry was said to have found no evidence of an institutional cover-up or of a paedophile ring operating within football, but intended publication of its report in September 2018 was delayed, potentially by up to a year, pending the retrial of Higgins and possible further charges against Bennell.\n\nThe sexual abuse allegations related to several publicly identified individuals, listed below in the order of which they were named as the scandal developed from late 2016, through 2017 and into 2018 (some individuals, including Bennell, Ormond, Langford and Torbett, had previously been named and convicted for earlier offences of sexual abuse).\n\nOn 16 November 2016, former Crewe defender Andy Woodward alleged in an interview with Daniel Taylor of \"The Guardian\" newspaper that he had been the victim of child sexual abuse by former football coach Barry Bennell at the club in the 1980s<ref name=\"BBC-17/11/2016\"></ref> (Woodward later claimed \"People should know I suffered more than one abuser\"). By 21 November, it was reported that six other people had contacted the police.\n\nOn 22 November, \"The Guardian\" alleged that Crewe teammate Steve Walters had been another of Bennell's victims, while Woodward criticised Crewe for failing to apologise. On 24 November, Dario Gradi, manager at Crewe during the early 1980s, released a statement saying he knew nothing of Bennell's crimes until Bennell was arrested in the United States in 1994.\n\nOn 23 November, former Manchester City players David White and Paul Stewart made similar sex abuse allegations about Bennell, and about another coach (later named as Frank Roper) at the Nova feeder club. Cheshire police said they had been contacted by 11 people (including Walters, but excluding White and Stewart) regarding the Bennell case. On 25 November, two further youth players, Jason Dunford and Chris Unsworth, also alleged sexual abuse by Bennell, initially at a Manchester City nursery team; Dunford also later spoke of abuse by Frank Roper. (In February 2018, it was revealed that three former Manchester City players had lodged civil cases against the club in March 2016 after allegedly becoming victims of Bennell.)\n\nOn 27 November, another former Crewe player, Anthony Hughes, said that he too had been abused by Bennell. Wales and Manchester United youth player Matthew Monaghan, former Preston North End reserve team player David Lean, and Wimbledon and ex Northern Ireland international Mark Williams also alleged abuse by Bennell.\n\nDoubt regarding Crewe's claims of ignorance began to emerge on 25 November. First, Hamilton Smith, a director at Crewe Alexandra from 1986 to 1990, told \"The Guardian\" that the club heard an allegation that Bennell had sexually abused a junior footballer. However, Bennell was allowed to stay at the club – despite the then chairman, Norman Rowlinson, recommending that the club \"get him out\" and raising concerns with Manchester City – so long as Bennell was not left alone with boys and was stopped from arranging overnight stays; it was later (February 2018) reported that Rowlinson had sought police advice about Bennell and had been advised to \"move him on\". Smith said fellow directors did not want to rely on hearsay evidence and local gossip. In 2001 Smith met Tony Pickerin, the Football Association's head of education and child protection (formerly head of the FA's national school at Lilleshall), and requested an FA investigation into the care of children at Gresty Road. He said he later received a three-line letter from Pickerin saying the FA had “investigated the issues and is satisfied that there is no case to answer.”\n\nSecondly, on 7 December 2016, the BBC reported that the mother of a former Crewe youth team player wrote an anonymous letter to Dario Gradi in 1989–90, asking him to investigate \"inappropriate\" behaviour whereby a member of staff \"took lots of boys into his room overnight\" during a weekend away in Blackpool.\n\nOnce a youth player at Chelsea, Bennell had worked for at least four English professional clubs: Manchester City, Crewe (from around 1984 until he was sacked in 1992 for reasons that have never been made public), Stoke City and Leeds United, and from 1992 to 1994 was head coach of the Staffordshire side Stone Dominoes. During a 1994 Dominoes tour to the United States, a 13-year-old club player claimed that Bennell had sexually abused him. Bennell was arrested in Jacksonville, Florida, and eventually charged on six counts of sexual battery and lewd and lascivious behavior. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years' imprisonment.\n\nIn the meantime, in 1996, a UK Channel 4 \"Dispatches\" programme highlighted child abuse allegations involving Bennell (also other coaches: Keith Ketley in Ipswich, Bob Higgins in Hampshire). The documentary featured Ian Ackley, a former player at Derbyshire youth side White Knowl, who was one of four boys who had come forward to British police after Bennell's US arrest. As a result, although Bennell did not serve the full term of imprisonment in America, he was arrested again on his return to England.\n\nIn February 1998, Bennell appeared at Mold Crown Court in north Wales and pleaded not guilty to charges of indecent assault, buggery and attempted buggery dating back to the 1970s and 1980s through to 1992, against children aged between nine and 15, with offences alleged to have taken place in Derbyshire, in the Crewe area and at Butlin's in Pwllheli, north Wales. Bennell was remanded in custody to appear at Chester Crown Court in June 1998. At Chester, Bennell was found guilty of 23 offences against six boys (including Ian Ackley), and received a nine-year jail sentence (a further 22 offences were left on file because the Crown Prosecution Service decided it was better not to put young boys through the trauma of a trial). In May 2015, Bennell (then calling himself 'Richard Jones' and living in Milton Keynes) received a further sentence of two years after pleading guilty to sexually abusing David Lean at a camp in Macclesfield in 1980.\n\nAt the inquest in 2012 into the death of Gary Speed, it was alleged that Speed and former Manchester United player Alan Davies had been \"favourites\" of Bennell, though there was no suggestion they had been abused by Bennell. Both players later took their own lives, as did Mark Hazeldine, coached by Bennell at Manchester City in the early 1980s.\n\nIn November 2016, Thames Valley Police visited Bennell's Milton Keynes address, though they said this was \"in response to a safeguarding concern\" and it was not investigating any offences. Bennell was taken to hospital in Stevenage after being found unconscious in Knebworth Park on Friday 25 November; Thames Valley police said officers had been called to a “fear for welfare” incident. It was believed Bennell was staying at a hotel after leaving his Milton Keynes home as the scandal broke. On 29 November 2016, then 62-year-old Bennell was charged with eight counts of sexual assault against a boy aged under 14, alleged to have taken place between 1981 and 1985. Bennell appeared by videolink at South Cheshire magistrates' court in Crewe on 14 December, and was remanded in custody to appear at Chester Crown Court in January 2017. On 16 January 2017, speaking via videolink from HM Prison Woodhill, Bennell pleaded not guilty to the charges, and was remanded in custody until 20 March 2017.\n\nOn 7 March 2017, Bennell was charged with eight further counts of child sexual abuse. He appeared at South Cheshire magistrates' court via video-link on 13 March, when an additional four charges were also made, and was remanded in custody to appear at Chester Crown Court on 22 March, when all 20 charges against him were dealt with together. At that hearing, Bennell pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of indecent assault, five counts of buggery and one count of attempted buggery. The case was adjourned to 3 July 2017 at Liverpool Crown Court with a trial listed for January 2018 in Liverpool.\n\nIn May 2017, Bennell appeared in court having been charged with a further 21 offences: 18 counts of indecent assault, two of serious sexual assault and one of attempted sexual assault, relating to four boys aged between 14 and 16, and alleged to have taken place between 1983 and 1991.\n\nIn June 2017, Bennell appeared in court charged with a further 14 offences (bringing the total to 55); ten of these charges related to indecent assaults on four 11- to 14-year-olds, four for alleged buggery. He made court appearances on 28 June and 17 July, when he was remanded in custody ahead of a trial due to start on 8 January 2018.\n\nAs Bennell had previously changed his name to Richard Jones, in court he was referred to as 'Mr Jones'. At the start of his trial on 8 January 2018, he pleaded guilty to seven offences of indecent assault committed between 1981 and 1991 against three boys. As the prosecution presented evidence relating to the remaining 48 charges, he appeared via video-link due to an illness that required him to be fed through a tube. The jury was sent out to consider its verdict on 8 February 2018, having been directed to return not guilty verdicts in respect of three indecent assault charges where no evidence had been offered. On 13 February 2018, Bennell was found guilty of 36 sex offences; after the jury were given more time to consider other counts, on 15 February he was convicted of seven further offences. Following the earlier seven guilty pleas, he was sentenced on Monday 19 February for a total of 50 offences against 12 boys, and was jailed for 31 years (being expected to serve half in custody, with the rest on licence).\n\nAfter the guilty verdicts, victims Andy Woodward, Micky Fallon, Chris Unsworth and Steve Walters read statements outside Liverpool Crown Court; another victim, Gary Cliffe, waived his anonymity to speak about the abuse he had experienced, aged 11 to 15, from Bennell while at Manchester City. The club offered its \"heartfelt sympathy to all victims for the unimaginably traumatic experiences they have endured\", and said an internal review had identified serious allegations of child sex abuse in respect of a second man, John Broome (now dead), with \"potential historic connections to the club\". Crewe Alexandra expressed its \"deepest sympathies\" to Bennell's victims, saying it was not aware of any sexual abuse by Bennell nor had it received any complaint about sexual abuse by him before or during his employment with the club. This claim has been disputed: the \"Guardian\" alleged Bennell had to leave Crewe following a complaint against him, having been identified as a risk long before joining Crewe, amid a cover-up at Manchester City. Lord Carlile, the barrister who prosecuted Bennell in 1998, accused Crewe of 'brushing the scandal under the carpet'.\n\nFollowing complaints from other former players (the \"Guardian\" said there had allegations from another 86 former footballers), mostly from Manchester City and Crewe, Bennell was reported to be likely to face a further trial, though the judge (Clement Goldstone QC) said the Crown Prosecution Service would have to think carefully as Bennell \"may well die in prison.\" In September 2018, it was reported that the police and Crown Prosecution Service regarded some of allegations, particularly the rape of minors, as serious enough to warrant criminal action, potentially in 2019.\n\nIn April 2018, it was reported that Bennell was appealing against his 30-year sentence. In June 2018, his appeal was rejected and the sentence was upheld by three judges at the High Court in London.\n\nOn 24 November 2016, \"The Guardian\" reported that an anonymous ex-footballer had contacted police to say he was a victim of George Ormond, a former Newcastle United youth coach who was jailed in December 2002 for offences against young footballers in the area. On 29 November 2016, \"The Guardian\" reported allegations by Derek Bell that he had been abused by George Ormond at the Montagu and North Fenham boys football club in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Conn/Parveen-06Dec2016\"></ref> Bell later played for Newcastle United (1980–1984) and on 1 December accused Newcastle of a cover-up over the abuse allegations. Bell claimed he alerted the club in 1998 but although Ormond's employment ended, his conduct was not investigated or reported to the police until 2001. \"The Guardian\" also reported allegations about Ormond from David Eatock, who signed for Newcastle as an 18-year-old in 1995.\n\nOrmond was described by a judge in 2002 as a \"predatory abuser\" after he was convicted of 12 indecent assaults and one attempted indecent assault on seven boys which had taken place between 1975 and 1999.\n\nIn May 2017, Ormond, aged 61 and from Newton Abbot in Devon, was charged with 29 offences (27 of indecent assault, one charge of indecency with a child and one of buggery, relating to 17 male complainants and alleged to have taken place from 1973 to 1998). He appeared by videolink at Newcastle magistrates' court on 9 June, and was bailed to appear on 7 July 2017 at Newcastle Crown Court. In that appearance, he denied 35 historic sexual offences (33 of indecent assault, one of gross indecency with a child and a serious sexual offence with a 15-year-old) said to relate to 18 complainants, and was bailed to reappear in May 2018.\n\nOrmond's trial at Newcastle Crown Court started on 24 May 2018. He was charged with 38 sexual offences against 19 victims over a 25-year period from 1973 to 1998. This includes the time he worked at Newcastle United, at a north-east boys’ football club, and as a helper on the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme at a Newcastle school. The prosecution case concluded on 25 June; Ormond elected not to give evidence in the trial, and, after the judge's summing up, the jury retired to consider its verdicts on 29 June. On 3 July 2018, the jury returned guilty verdicts on 36 counts of sexual abuse against 18 victims over a 24-year period between 1973 and 1997 (he was acquitted of two other offences); the following day, Ormond was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nNewcastle United made no comment apart from saying it had cooperated with the police and FA inquiries. Two victims of Ormond, Paul Chilton and Gary Weymes (and who both gave evidence against him), waived their right to anonymity and said Ormond's 20-year sentence was \"not enough\" while suggesting other victims had yet to come forward.\n\nOn 29 November 2016, Chelsea announced it was investigating allegations of historical sexual abuse in the 1970s, including a secret payment to a former player who had accused the club’s ex-chief scout Eddie Heath of child sexual abuse. On 2 December, the former player was named as Gary Johnson, who said he was paid £50,000 not to go public with allegations that he was sexually abused by Heath; the following day, Chelsea apologised \"profusely\" to Johnson, who later demanded further financial compensation from the club. Also on 3 December, \"The Independent\" reported an allegation from another Chelsea youth player that Dario Gradi, then Chelsea's assistant manager, visited the player's family's home to \"smooth over\" a complaint of sexual assault against Heath in 1974; Gradi was among the first to be targeted by the FA's enquiry, and, in connection with these allegations, on 11 December 2016, the FA announced that it had suspended Gradi (Gradi subsequently said he had been notified by the FA of his interim suspension from football on 25 November, and reiterated \"that I will do everything within my power to assist all investigatory authorities\"). Former Chelsea youth goalkeeper Derek Richardson became the third player to allege abuse by Heath.\n\nOn 4 December 2016, Heath was the subject of allegations of early 1980s abuse made by former youth player Russell Davy, at another London club, Charlton Athletic; Davy also wrote to the FA about Heath but his letter was not even acknowledged. Later the same month, another Charlton youth player Paul Collins also alleged abuse by Heath.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Heath was employed at Leyton Orient (former goalkeeper Peter Chapman described him as \"the dark eminence of Orient's youth outfit\"), where his sexual abuse was common knowledge among players including former captain Jimmy Scott, before joining Chelsea. In 1979, he contested his dismissal from Chelsea by then manager Geoff Hurst at an industrial tribunal. After leaving Chelsea, he worked at Millwall and then Charlton Athletic, before dying of a heart attack in the early 1980s.\n\nAt Southampton, former trainees Dean Radford, Jamie Webb and, later, Billy Seymour told the BBC about incidents they said happened when they were in their teens. Matt Le Tissier, who joined Southampton as a trainee in the mid-1980s, recalled being given a naked massage by Higgins. Le Tissier reiterated that he does not feel that he was abused, but thought this incident and other behaviour he witnessed was \"very wrong\". By 4 December 2016, six players had alleged abuse by an ex-Southampton employee, and various media named him as Bob Higgins, until recently a first team coach (said not to be involved with youth players) at non-league side Fleet Town.\n\nBob Higgins was dismissed by Southampton in 1989 after several allegations were made against him, and after he set up the \"Bob Higgins Soccer Academy\", the Football League wrote to all clubs in April 1989 warning them against any involvement with it.<ref name=\"James/Morris-05Dec2016\"></ref> He then joined the Malta Football Association.\n\nIn 1991 he was charged with six counts of indecent assault against young boys he had been coaching; at the trial at Southampton Crown Court, he was acquitted on the direction of the judge when the prosecution offered no evidence. Higgins was suspended by the Malta FA between 1990 and 1992 when the original allegations were made, reinstated on a year's probation after being cleared, and then left in 1994. While working in Malta, Higgins was said to have 'showered naked' with young players; one youth said it was common for Higgins to drive him in his car and touch him around his neck and his legs.\n\nHiggins then worked as a youth coach at Peterborough United from May 1995 to April 1996, and was investigated as part of the 1997 Channel 4 \"Dispatches\" investigation, and denied allegations of abuse, claiming he was a faith healer and born again Christian. One former youth player alleged Higgins provided \"soapy massages\"; another, 'Jon' (not his real name), said he was left emotionally scarred and needing treatment for mental health issues, and that complaints made in 2013 to Peterborough resulted in no action.\n\nIn 1997, letters were sent to clubs and youth groups warning them that Higgins posed a risk to children. Higgins was then appointed manager of non-league Bashley, until he was sacked in 2001. The BBC reported that Higgins then worked at Winchester City for a few months; \"At a meeting with Hampshire County Council and the local FA, Winchester representatives were shown the TV documentary that had aired a few years earlier and it was made clear it was inappropriate for Mr Higgins to stay at the club.\"\n\nOn 5 July 2017, Higgins was charged with 65 counts of indecent assault. The offences were alleged to have taken place in the 1980s and 1990s and to have involved 23 alleged victims. He appeared at West Hampshire (Southampton) Magistrates' Court on 20 July, when he indicated he would plead not guilty to the alleged offences and was given unconditional bail until a hearing at Winchester Crown Court on 16 August 2017. At a pre-trial hearing in January 2018, Higgins denied 50 charges of abusing 24 boys between 1970 and 1996; he was set to stand trial at Salisbury Crown Court on 29 May 2018.\n\nThe trial at Salisbury Crown Court started on 29 May 2018, with Higgins, 65, denying 50 counts of indecent assault between 1971 and 1996 in relation to 24 boys. The prosecution case started on 30 May, with the trial sheduled to last six to eight weeks. The jury retired to consider their verdicts on 17 July 2018. On 23 July, Higgins was found guilty of one charge of indecent assault, and not guilty of another count of the same offence, while the jury failed to reach verdicts on 48 other counts of the same charge. A retrial is to be held in February 2019.\n\nOn 5 December 2016, allegations spread to Scotland when a former youth football coach and assistant referee, Hugh Stevenson (who died in 2004), was accused by Peter Haynes of child sex offences over a three to four-year period said to have begun on the day of the 1979 Scottish Cup Final between Rangers and Hibernian at Hampden Park. Stevenson was assistant referee in at least four international matches, including the England v Wales home international at Wembley in 1977, and was a club official at Eastercraigs Boys Club between the late 1970s and mid 1980s, before being asked to leave after attempting inappropriate contact with a boy at another club. He then moved to the Glasgow-based Chelsea Boys Club, which had an affiliation to the London club, and later was involved with the Paisley-based Ferguslie United and Cowdenbeath. Police Scotland confirmed that a then 55-year-old man had been investigated by Strathclyde Police in 1993 and 1996, with reports submitted to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service each time.\n\nAlso on 5 December 2016, Mitch Agnew, part of Ferguslie United's coaching set-up in the 1990s and a senior figure in the Scottish Youth Football Association, was suspended pending an investigation.\n\nIn Belfast, on 7 December 2016, former Celtic youth coach Jim McCafferty was charged with offences relating to sexual activity with a child, allegedly committed in Northern Ireland. On 5 January 2017, he appeared via video-link from Maghaberry jail in County Antrim at Belfast Laganside court, charged with engaging in sexual activity with a child aged between 13 and 16 in Northern Ireland between December 2011 and December 2014. At this and a further court hearing, he was remanded in custody. McCafferty was due to appear at Laganside on Friday 1 September, but proceedings were delayed pending medical reports. At a further court hearing on 27 September 2017, McCafferty's intention to plead guilty to at least two of eight sex charges was considered, but the arraignment hearing was adjourned until November 2017 to allow psychiatric reports. In February 2018 at Belfast Crown Court, McCafferty was formally arraigned on eight charges, with a trial date set for 21 May 2018.\n\nMcCafferty, former kitman for Celtic, Hibernian and Falkirk, admitted abusing teenagers in the 1980s and 1990s while coaching boys’ and junior teams in West Lothian, Scotland, and at Celtic between 1990 and 1996.\n\nOn 21 May 2018, McCafferty, aged 71, pleaded guilty to all eight charges at Laganside Courts in Belfast. McCafferty was remanded to Maghaberry Prison pending a sentencing hearing to take place on 22 June 2018. Sentencing was later adjourned to 13 August 2018 when McCafferty was sentenced to three years and nine months in prison.\n\nOn 5 January 2017, the FA suspended former youth coach Paul McCann, who worked for Crewe in a voluntary capacity in the 1980s and 90s and was assistant coach of the club's under-16s youth team for a time, and later a volunteer youth coach at Merseyside non-league club AFC Bebington in 2014-15.\n\nAlmost a year later, on 3 January 2018, McCann, 57, appeared at South Cheshire magistrates' court charged with six non-recent sexual offences, including indecent assault on a boy under the age of 16 years and indecent assault on the same victim when aged 16 or over, dating back to 1987-1989. McCann, from Great Sutton in Cheshire, appeared at Chester Crown Court on 31 January when he denied the charges and was released on unconditional bail. He again denied the charges when his trial at Chester Crown Court began on 8 October, and on 18 October 2018 was acquitted of all charges.\n\nOn 27 January 2017, it was reported that (after Higgins) a second former Peterborough United coach had been arrested during investigations into historical sexual abuse. Michael Sean \"Kit\" Carson, 73, was held in Cambridge on suspicion of indecency with children and indecent assault; the following day, he was released on bail until 6 March.\n\nCarson worked at Norwich City from 1983 until 1993, and was academy director at Peterborough from 1993 to 2001 (overlapping with Bob Higgins for almost a year), before leaving to become head of talent development at Cambridge United from 2001 to 2005.\n\nOn 2 March 2018 it was announced that Carson had been charged with 11 counts of indecent assault and one of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. The alleged offences all involved boys under 16, and were said to have occurred from 1978 to 2009. Carson, 74, appeared at Cambridge magistrates' court on 17 April 2018, pleading not guilty to the 12 charges, then appeared at Peterborough crown court on 15 May 2018 when he was released on bail pending an administrative hearing on 20 July 2018 ahead of a yet-to-be-determined trial date.\n\nOn 30 January 2017, former Leicester City trainee Tony Brien told the BBC that he had been abused from the age of 12 by club scout Ted Langford in the 1980s while at local youth team Dunlop Tigers (Langford had been named in allegations which surfaced in December 2016). Brien said he had been assaulted on the pretext that the scout needed the player's sperm to establish whether he had a \"footballer's gene\". When Langford moved to Aston Villa, Brien says he had \"two or three\" conversations with the club's former assistant manager Dave Richardson and another senior figure, but was put off from going public with the allegations. In September 2017, it was reported that Graham Taylor (then manager of Aston Villa, and later manager of England) had discouraged Brien from reporting what had happened, telling him that he should \"move on\".\n\nLangford was sacked by Aston Villa in 1988. He later admitted sex offences, dating from 1976 until after he left the club in 1989; he was sentenced to three years in prison in 2007 for the sexual abuse of four young players (excluding Brien) in the 1970s and 80s. He died in 2012.\n\nOn 24 March 2017, it was reported that 84-year-old former youth football scout Harry Dunn, who had worked at Liverpool, Rangers and Chelsea, had been arrested by Scottish police investigating allegations of historical sex abuse. In February 2017, Dunn had been the subject of allegations by a former Rangers youth player, Darren Mixon, concerning an incident in 1984. In November 2017, it was reported that Dunn had died.\n\nJames Torbett, a former Celtic Boys Club manager, was found guilty in 1998 of shameless and indecent conduct with three juvenile players between October 1967 and March 1974, and given a prison sentence of 30 months. In April 2017, a BBC Scotland programme \"Football Abuse: The Ugly Side of the Beautiful Game\", alleged that the reasons for Torbett leaving Celtic Boys' Club in 1974 were covered up, that Torbett was allowed to return to the Boys' Club, and that two youth players (one named as Kenny Campbell) were abused by Torbett in his second spell at the Boys' Club during the 1980s and 1990s - claims which Torbett has \"vehemently\" denied. Tracked down in America, Torbett was confronted by a BBC Scotland reporter about the Campbell allegations; he said: \"I have a lot to say. I'll see him in court,\" and denied being a paedophile.\n\nIn early May 2017, following a visit from US Homeland Security, he returned to the UK; he was subsequently arrested and charged with six offences (three of indecent assault and three of lewd, indecent and libidinous practices), and on 5 May 2017 appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court where he was released on bail. In April 2018, Torbett appeared at the High Court in Glasgow where he faced 12 historical sexual abuse charges dating from January 1970 to August 1994; a June 2018 trial date was set.\n\nThe trial, expected to last 10 days, started on 25 June 2018, with Torbett denying all charges. On 4 July 2018, a contempt of court order was issued regarding the case. On 22 October 2018, Torbett went on trial again at Glasgow High Court, charged with nine offences of sexual assault on six children between 1970 and 1990. On 5 November 2018, he was found guilty of five offences against three boys and was sentenced to six years in prison.\n\nThe same BBC Scotland programme also made new allegations against Gordon Neely (who died in 2014), a youth coach at Rangers in the 1980s who, after abuse allegations were made, had been \"dismissed immediately,\" the Glasgow club said. Neely had also been accused by former youth player Colin Anderson of abuse at Edinburgh youth club Hutchison Vale. According to the BBC, youth player Jon Cleland was repeatedly raped by Neely while at Hutchison Vale and at Hibernian (Neely took up a youth development position with Hibs in around 1983). After abuse allegations were made against Neely in 1986, he was sacked, but subsequently joined Rangers where his abuse continued. After he left Rangers in about 1990, he allegedly continued to abuse young players when offering one-to-one training and activity weekends in Dunkeld and Dalguise, Perthshire, for young footballers.\n\nIn mid April 2017, Gerald King, a former chairman of Celtic Boys Club, was charged by police with non-recent sexual offences. In February 2018, he pleaded not guilty to seven offences, and was bailed. His bail was extended at hearings at Glasgow Sheriff Court on 17 April and 23 May 2018. King's trial began on 26 November 2018 at Glasgow Sheriff Court. King, 66, was accused of lewd and libidinous practices towards five boys and two girls while he was a teacher at a Glasgow school, between August 1983 and June 1989; he was also charged with taking or permitting to be taken indecent images of children between January 1987 and December 1988 at Barrowfield football park in Glasgow.\n\nIn late April 2017, Frank Cairney, 82, a former Celtic Boys Club coach and manager (who, in November 1998, had been acquitted of charges of shameless indecency towards young football players due to lack of evidence), was charged in connection with six alleged historical sexual offences. He appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court on 11 May 2018, facing ten charges of alleged abuse between 1965 and 1986, including indecent assault, gross indecency and lewd, indecent and libidinous practices and behaviour. A trial date was not set as Cairney's defence team requested three months delay to investigate witness statements; a further pre-trial hearing was scheduled for 10 August 2018.\n\nRobert Smith was jailed for 27 months in 2016 for sexually abusing three boys aged between nine and 12 who played for a football team he was coaching in the Easterhouse area of Glasgow in the 1980s. In June 2018, he pleaded guilty to six further charges: four charges of using lewd and libidinous practices and two charges of indecent assault. On 13 July 2018, Smith, 69, was sentenced to 20 months in prison.\n\nOn 20 July 2018, William Toner, 74, was jailed for three years and two months on four counts of indecent assault against a teenage boy in the 1990s. A trial heard he preyed on a junior footballer after claiming to work for Manchester City and having links to clubs in Bury, Rochdale, Oldham and Cambridgeshire.\n\nAlso on 20 July 2018, Michael Coleman, 75, was jailed for seven years on three counts of indecent assault at Bolton Crown Court. He was unconnected to any senior club when he committed his crimes in the 1980s while he was manager of Westhoughton Sports Centre.\n\nAlleged abusers also included (in alphabetical order):\n\nOn 21 November 2016, the Football Association said it was setting up a helpline; this was established with the NSPCC and opened on 24 November, reportedly receiving over 50 calls within the first two hours, over 100 by 27 November, and 860 (\"more than three times as many referrals as in the first three days of the Jimmy Savile scandal\") by 1 December with 350 individuals alleging abuse. After three weeks, the call total had reached 1700. The FA and NSPCC also collaborated to produce a film about how to keep children safe in the sport, featuring the captains of England's men's, women's and cerebral palsy football teams (Wayne Rooney, Steph Houghton and Jack Rutter).\n\nAfter the Hamilton Smith interview suggesting the FA failed to thoroughly investigate Crewe's system, on 27 November, the FA announced it was to set up an internal review, led by independent counsel Kate Gallafent QC, into what Crewe and Manchester City knew about Barry Bennell and allegations of child sexual abuse in football, and investigate what information it was aware of at the time of the alleged offences.\n\nThe FA was criticised by Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the House of Commons' Culture, Media and Sport Committee, for being too slow in reacting and not instigating a wider review. Former sport minister Gerry Sutcliffe talked of previous concern about how the FA dealt with governance of the sport and with youth development (in the 1990s, the FA was said to have reacted \"dismissively\" to worries about sexual abuse in the game, and too slow to implement criminal record checks; in 2003, the FA had scrapped a project meant to ensure children were being protected from sexual abuse; and FA officials had been uncooperative with the review project, with ten of 14 FA staff not replying to interview requests and a report by the researchers of others being \"prevented/bullied\" from talking). Sutcliffe said an independent body, such as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, should look at the issue rather than the FA investigating itself: \"What I've seen in football over the years is that they're very narrow, very insular, and may not do a proper job even though with the right intentions.\"\n\nOn 6 December 2016, the FA announced that, due to \"the increased scope of the review since it was announced\" and Gallafent's other professional commitments, the review would be conducted by Clive Sheldon QC. On the same day, it was announced that former Chelsea assistant manager Dario Gradi would be among the first to be targeted by the FA's enquiry over the \"smoothing over\" allegation, and five days later the FA announced Gradi had been suspended. Almost three months later, in February 2017, it was reported that Gradi planned to appeal against his FA suspension from football, feeling he had been left \"in limbo\".\n\nOn 5 January 2017, it was reported that the FA had suspended former Crewe youth coach Paul McCann.\n\nThe FA collaborated with other UK sports bodies to support the NSPCC's Child Protection in Sport Unit (CPSU), founded in 2001 following various 1990s revelations of abuse, most notably in swimming. Brunel University's Daniel Rhind said the FA is today seen as a leading sports governing body for child protection with the system put in place since the CPSU was formed regarded as a “gold standard” model other countries can follow. In December 2016, the FA said that 99% of its 7,814 grassroots clubs, covering 62,238 teams, had responded to a deadline to renew their safeguarding policies and commitment. On 6 January 2017, the FA said 99.7% of clubs' coaches had valid criminal records checks but more than 2,500 coaches were without an in-date CRC, and so these clubs were facing potential suspension and removal of their FA affiliation.\n\nOn 11 January 2017, it was reported that the FA's review, led by Clive Sheldon, had made its first call for evidence, writing to all football clubs in England and Wales, amateur and professional, asking for information about allegations of child sexual abuse between 1970 and 2005. Clubs had until 15 March 2017 to respond. The FA's inquiry was expected to last around a year to 18 months. In May 2017, eight (unnamed) professional clubs were reported to have failed to respond to the FA's call for evidence, despite a deadline extension to the end of April, as investigators started to search 5,000 boxes of FA archives - each containing up to 1,000 pages. Sheldon issued a fresh appeal for victims of sexual abuse in football to come forward in July 2017. In October 2017, it was reported that six county Football Associations had not responded to requests for information five months after being asked to do so, while the volume of material involved would delay the final report until after Easter 2018. Ongoing criminal proceedings against Bennell, Higgins and others were also likely to limit what could be covered in the report. Sheldon and other members of the enquiry team were reported to be receiving counselling after hearing some victims' abuse accounts. In March 2018, it was reported that the scale of evidence provided, plus the \"chaotic nature of the archiving\", had delayed the inquiry team's sift through the FA's legal files; around 500,000 pages of material from 6,000 files were uploaded to a digital platform, and 353 documents were identified as highly relevant. All 46 county FAs had responded to the inquiry. Sheldon expected to start writing his final report in August 2018.\n\nIn October 2017, FA chairman Greg Clarke was criticised by Andy Woodward for 'humiliating' remarks Clarke made to a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing, while the Professional Footballers' Association's chief executive Gordon Taylor said the PFA might sue Clarke over suggestions Taylor had not supported Woodward with further counselling.\n\nIn July 2018, it was reported that the FA's independent inquiry had found no evidence of an institutional cover-up or of a paedophile ring operating within football. Sheldon's report, likely to be highly critical of several clubs, was initially expected to be delivered to the FA in September 2018, but its publication was delayed, potentially by up to a year, pending the retrial of Bob Higgins and possible further charges against Barry Bennell.\n\nEight days after Woodward's initial revelations, the PFA said on 24 November 2016 that the number of players who had contacted it with similar stories had reached double figures, later (27 November) revising this to \"more than 20\" and adding Blackpool and Leeds United to the list of clubs implicated. In January 2017, it was reported that Steve Walters had been on a course of counselling at the Priory provided by the PFA.\n\nOn 7 December 2016, Premier League boss Richard Scudamore wrote to the parents of more than 3,000 players in the league's youth system to reassure them regarding child protection. On 23 December 2016, it was reported that Chelsea had not broken Premier League rules in failing to report 2014 allegations of historical sexual abuse made by Gary Johnson, but would undergo a safeguarding audit.\n\nAfter the Hugh Stevenson allegations emerged, Scottish Football Association chief executive Stewart Regan apologised \"deeply\" to Peter Haynes. Former SFA chief executive Gordon Smith, civil rights lawyer Raju Bhatt and Deputy First Minister John Swinney all called for an independent inquiry after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon rejected calls for an existing inquiry to be widened. On 13 December 2016, the SFA said it would set up an \"independent review\" of child abuse allegations in football; on the same date, of 15,385 coaches registered with the Scottish Youth Football Association, 2,500 had not had Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance, though this backlog was largely cleared ahead of a 31 August 2017 deadline. In February 2017, it was reported that the SFA's enquiry would be headed by Martin Henry, formerly a police protection chief and national manager of child sexual abuse prevention charity Stop it Now! Scotland.\n\nIn Manchester on 5 December 2016, abuse victims Andy Woodward, Steve Walters, Chris Unsworth, Matthew Monaghan and Mark Williams launched a support organisation, the Offside Trust, to support player victims of abuse and their families (though it is unclear if this body is to become a registered charity). At the launch, the Trust's lawyer Ed Smethurst talked of alleged abusers still working \"in the senior echelons\" of football, of \"grave misgivings about the FA's independent inquiry\", and of new claims that clubs had paid 'hush money'. On 3 February 2017, it was announced that Woodward was stepping away from the Trust, having resigned as a director. On 20 August 2017, a celebrity football match was played at Curzon Ashton F.C. in Manchester to raise funds for the Trust.\n\nDario Gradi's 24 November statement mentioned Crewe Alexandra had established an internal review, and the club subsequently announced it would be holding an independent review into how they dealt with historical child sex abuse allegations: \"an independent review, to be conducted via the appointment of external legal counsel, is the correct way forward\". In February 2018, the club had not started this review, claiming an unnamed authority told them to hold off until the criminal case was over. On 2 March 2018, the club issued a statement saying that, as it had fully supported and co-operated with the police's detailed and comprehensive investigations, it did \"not intend to commission a further independent investigation to duplicate the thorough enquiries that have already been undertaken,\" and said the police's report had also been supplied to the FA review headed by Clive Sheldon. Crewe's decision to shelve its own investigation was criticised by local MP Laura Smith (daughter of former club director Hamilton Smith) who said victims deserved nothing less than a thorough investigation which \"should be transparent and leave no stone unturned.\" The club was also excluded from the NorthWest Football Awards, was criticised by Damian Collins, chair of the DCMS select committee, and by Crewe Town Council, and was called to reconsider its decision by the PFA's Gordon Taylor.\n\nManchester City said it had opened an investigation regarding Bennell's association with the club in the 1980s; in May 2017, it was reported this was being led by Jane Mulcahy QC. Stoke said they were ready to launch an investigation into any allegation raised. On 25 November, Northumbria Police said their inquiries were \"ongoing\", while Newcastle United said it would cooperate with the police and relevant authorities. On 29 November, Chelsea announced it had appointed a law firm to carry out an investigation connected to allegations of historical sexual abuse in the 1970s; it was later reported that Chelsea's review was being chaired by Charles Geekie QC, a specialist in child abuse cases.\n\nThe FA's enquiry also linked to club enquiries. In May 2017, FA letters were sent to almost 20 clubs linked to the scandal to establish if they are holding their own reviews and, if not, why not. Clubs including Chelsea, Manchester City, Newcastle United, Southampton, Aston Villa, Blackpool and Crewe Alexandra were asked to submit evidence to Sheldon's own review. In March 2018, Clive Sheldon warned up to a dozen clubs they must hold their own investigations into abuse claims or he will do it, putting pressure on Crewe to reconsider its decision not to hold an inquiry.\n\nInitially, Cheshire police were reported to be liaising with Greater Manchester Police over the allegations, with the Manchester force later confirming it was launching an investigation and co-operating with Operation Hydrant, the national co-ordination hub for historical child abuse investigations concerning persons of public prominence. On 26 November Hampshire Police said it was looking into claims of \"non-recent child abuse within the football community\", while the Metropolitan Police also opened investigations. By 1 December, Staffordshire Police, Police Scotland, Essex Police, Norfolk Police and North Wales Police were reported to be among 17 forces examining claims of historical sex abuse in football. On 6 December 2016, the Police Service of Northern Ireland became the 21st UK police force to confirm it was investigating claims. On 13 December 2016, the Metropolitan Police said it was investigating 106 allegations of historical sexual abuse at 32 London football clubs (including four in the Premier League, two in the Championship, three against clubs in Leagues One and Two and 21 other clubs including non-league or non-professional or amateur teams). Some six weeks later (30 January 2017), the Met were reported to be investigating 255 separate allegations against individuals at 77 clubs, including all five London Premiership teams.\n\nBy 3 December 2016, 55 professional and non-league clubs had been cited by people claiming they were abused. On 9 December 2016, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said 83 potential suspects and 98 clubs were involved in the inquiry into child abuse; on 21 December 2016, the NPCC's figures were updated to 155 suspects and 148 clubs, with detectives said to be examining possible attacks on 429 people. The \"higher than usual\" volume of calls was said to be delaying police interviews and investigations, with some respondents waiting more than a month; the first wave of victims waited an average of six weeks to be interviewed. The increase in allegations of child sexual abuse linked to football led Cheshire Police to ask the Home Office for extra funding.\n\nOn 18 January 2017, the NPCC said the number of affected clubs had grown to 248, up 100 since its December 2016 update. It said Operation Hydrant had received 1,016 referrals from the NSPCC and from police forces (up from 819), and had identified 184 suspects and 526 potential victims, of whom 97% are male, with ages ranging from four to 20 when the alleged abuse took place. In April 2017, Operation Hydrant was reported to have received over 400 new referrals since January, bringing the total to 1,432 referrals, and was investigating complaints involving 311 clubs, 23% of them professional. The NPCC said the number of victims at 31 March 2017 stood at 560 (96% of them male), with 252 suspects identified. Up to 30 June 2017, Police Scotland said over 150 people had reported being sexually abused as a child within a football club setting, 295 crimes had been recorded, and 11 people had been arrested. According to NPCC figures, a total of 741 alleged victims had come forward by 30 June 2017, with 276 suspects named, 1,886 incidents reported and 328 clubs at every level of football affected. The figures were updated on 28 September 2017, and 31 December 2017, recording 839 alleged victims, 294 alleged suspects, arising from 2094 referrals, impacting 334 clubs.

{"id": "14606812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14606812", "title": "White-collar boxing", "text": "White-collar boxing\n\nWhite-collar boxing is a form of boxing in which men and women in white-collar professions train to fight at special events. Most have had no prior boxing experience.\n\nWhite-collar boxing has its beginnings at Gleason's Gym in New York City. Gym owner Bruce Silverglade began organizing informal fights between the white-collar workers of his clientele in the late 1980s, which later developed into regular monthly events. After developing into a regular monthly event, the sport came to prominence in the mid-1990s under the organization of boxing promoter Alan Lacey. By 2004 over 65% of Gleason's Gym membership was from a white-collar background, compared to 10% in the early 1990s. The increase of membership from this demographic has been credited with maintaining the profitability of boxing gyms in the US and UK.\n\nEvent management consultant Alan Lacey, who co-promoted the Gary Stretch vs. Chris Eubank WBO middleweight championship bout in 1991, belatedly discovered boxing training at the age of 45. Captivated and motivated by the discipline over the following years, he started training under former European champion Jimmy McDonnell and alongside two-time Olympian and world title challenger Adrian Dodson, who having spent most of his youth at Gleason’s Gym in New York suggested Lacey to fulfill his ambition to box, even at the age of 48, and arranged for him to visit Gleason's and box there. On the flight back to London, Lacey decided white-collar boxing could flourish in London. \nIn July 2000, the inaugural white-collar boxing event, \"Capital Punishment\", in collaboration with Gleason's owner Bruce Silverglade, saw a team of Wall Street bankers fly to London to compete at Broadgate Arena in London, generating interest and media coverage. Lacey boxed twice on the night and subsequently devoted his time and energy to developing the sport exclusively since. Over 100 sold-out events have followed \"Capital Punishment\", including \"Celebrity Boxing\" on the BBC in 2003 featuring, among others, Les Dennis and Ricky Gervais, and raising more than UK₤1.5 million for various charities. \n\nThe many bouts in the Asia–Pacific region are usually contested under WWCBA \"(see below)\" sanctioning.\n\nIn 2001, Lacey and Bruce Silverglade co-founded the International White Collar Boxing Association (IWCBA), the first and to this day main advisory and sanctioning governing body in the field, designed to regulate the bouts with a focus on safety. The IWCBA uses the same weight divisions of professional boxing and awards a belt to the champions of each weight category. Matchmaking of non-title bouts is based on level of experience as much as actual weight. It also rigorously requires the presence of an experienced doctor, an anesthetist, and a paramedic unit at ringside as well as thorough medical checks. Over 1,500 bouts have been sanctioned by the IWCBA over the years, with zero injuries aside from bloody noses. IWBCA-sanctioned bouts are predominant in the UK and US.\n\nIn 2007, the World White Collar Boxing Association (WWCBA) was founded to London, UK, to regulate and promote the sport throughout the world, but is principally active in the Asia–Pacific region. The WWCBA provides a common platform in the form of rules and guidelines allowing boxers to become ranked nationally, regionally and globally and to contest for championship titles. In 2008 the WWCBA sanctioned 9 events throughout the world. The WWCBA works with other boxing authorities such as the amateur International Boxing Association (AIBA) to ensure strong standards.\n\nBouts are usually three 2-minute rounds (\"3×2\" format), unlike the longer three 3-minute rounds (3×3) in the Amateur Code for men and 4×2 format for women. The IWCBA bouts have traditionally been \"no decision\" draws (ties) in absence of a knock-out, while WWCBA ranking system requires a win-loss decision for all bouts.\n\nThe first large gala events included the Boodles Boxing Ball series attended by Prince Harry as well as the \"Hedge Fund Fight Nite\" raising over $200,000 for charity both is initially organized/staged by The Real Fight Club.\n\nIn 2005 a purely non-profit black-tie gala at the London Hilton organized by The David Adams Leukaemia Appeal Fund & Mr King with more than 950 black-tie dinner guests raised over £100,000 for The Royal Marsden Hospital Cancer Campaign on the night. It was the largest event of its kind until 2013, see below.\n\nIn April 2009 a gala at Suntec Singapore Exhibition and Convention Centre staged by Vanda Promotions had more than 900 black-tie guests.\n\nOn Saturday, 18 July 2009, the Channel Island of Jersey held its first white-collar-boxing event. Nine fights were watched by over 600 paying, black-tied guests at the Hotel de France, raising around £15,000 for local charities.\n\nUltra White Collar Boxing (UWCB) are the largest company organising events in the UK. They held the largest event in November 2014 with 3000 spectators, they hold events in over 100 towns and cities across the UK and have raised over £16,000,000 to date for Cancer Research UK. They also held the largest event in the UK with over 3,500 guest at an event in Coventry in 2015. UWCB organise over 250 events a year with an average of 15,000 people taking part each year. \n\nOn 13 October 2012, Neilson Boxing, a Swindon-based white-collar-boxing promoter, put on the largest show of its kind to date. A venue verified attendance of 1398 watched ten contests at the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon with the main event seeing Dave 'Bam Bam' Gregory retain his NP Heavyweight title against Rich 'The Tank' Loveday over three rounds. This was surpassed in March 2014 when a crowd of nearly 2,000 fight fans saw 'Sugar' Shawn Grant defeat ex-pro Phill Day to gain the Vacant Cruiserweight Title.\n\nOn 20 April 2013, Vanda Promotions (part of Vanda Sports Group) held its twenty-fourth event in Singapore making the series the longest consecutive white-collar boxing in the history of the sport. A verified attendance of 1,943 attended the black-tie event at the Raffles Convention Centre which brought total attendance over the five-year history of the events to 15,491. The event also saw Vanda move past the $2 million mark for funds raised for children's charities in Asia and for the continued funding of the Vanda Wing at Children's Surgical Centre in Cambodia. Vanda was also the recipient of the \"Promoter of the year award\" for the fourth consecutive year from the World White Collar Boxing Association (WWCBA).\n\nOn 3 February 2018, two British YouTubers, KSI and , fought at Copper Box Arena in London, England, where KSI defeated Weller by technical knockout. At its peak, 1.6 million viewers tuned in live, making it the UK boxing's largest live audience since Anthony Joshua vs. Wladimir Klitschko in April 2017. On YouTube, the KSI vs. Weller fight drew 21million views on fight night, and over 25million over the next several days, becoming the biggest white-collar boxing fight in history. KSI was awarded the YouTube Boxing Championship Belt.\n\nKSI fought American YouTube personality Logan Paul in a white-collar boxing match on 25 August 2018. One judge scored in favour of KSI and two judges scored a draw, resulting in a majority draw. The fight has been labeled \"the largest event in YouTube history\" and \"the largest ever amateur boxing fight\".\n\nSixteen-ounce gloves are standard in the white-collar-boxing ring in order to protect competitors from heavy blows and hand injuries. Some gyms permit 14 oz gloves as well for lighter weight classes and for female competitors. Moreover, headgear, groin protectors, and mouthguards are obligatory requirements inside the ring.\n\nOn 21 June 2014, white-collar boxer Lance Ferguson-Prayogg collapsed following a fight at The Forum nightclub in Nottingham, England. Paramedics were called, and he was taken to hospital, but died the next day. An inquest ultimately attributed his death to the use of diet pills, not boxing.\n\n\n\n"}
