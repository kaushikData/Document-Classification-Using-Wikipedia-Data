{"id": "51874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51874", "title": "Googly", "text": "Googly\n\nIn cricket, a googly is a type of deceptive delivery bowled by a right-arm leg spin bowler. In Australia, it is occasionally referred to as a Bosie (or Bosey), an eponym in honour of its inventor Bernard Bosanquet. A leg spin bowler bowls in a leg spin way but it goes in the off side direction.\n\nWhile a normal leg break spins from the leg to the off side, away from a right-handed batsman, a googly spins the other way, from off to leg, into a right-handed batsman (and is distinct from an off break delivery). The bowler achieves this change of spin by bending the wrist sharply from the normal leg break delivery position. When the ball rolls out of the hand (from the side near the little finger, as in a normal leg break), it emerges with clockwise spin (from the bowler's point of view). A googly may also be achieved by bowling the ball as a conventional leg break, but spinning the ball further with the fingers just before it is released.\n\nThe change of wrist action can be seen by a skilled batsman and the change of spin allowed for when playing a shot at the ball. Less skilled batsmen, or ones who have lost their concentration, can be deceived completely, expecting the ball to move one direction off the pitch, only for it to move the other direction. If the batsman is expecting a leg break, he will play outside the line of the ball after it spins. This means the ball can either strike the pads for a potential lbw appeal, or may fly between the bat and the pads and hit the wicket, or catch the edge of the bat.\n\nThe googly is a major weapon in the arsenal of a leg spin bowler, and can be one of the bowler's most effective most important wicket-taking balls. It is used infrequently, because its effectiveness comes mostly from its surprise value.\n\nLeft-arm unorthodox spinners, commonly known as \"chinaman\" bowlers, can bowl with the googly action using the left arm. This delivery is usually known as a chinaman googly and turns away from a right-handed batsman, like a leg break or left-arm orthodox spinner. The googly is similar in principle to the doosra, the ball from an off-spinner which turns the opposite way from his stock ball.\n\nChambers Dictionary describes the whole of etymology of the word as \"dubious\".\n\nTo grip the ball for a leg-spinning delivery, the ball is placed into the palm with the seam parallel to the palm. The first two fingers then spread and grip the ball, and the third and fourth fingers close together and rest against the side of the ball. The first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam. The thumb resting against the side is up to the bowler, but should impart no pressure. When the ball is bowled, the third finger will apply most of the spin. The wrist is cocked as it comes down by the hip, and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as the ball is released, adding more spin. The ball is tossed up to provide flight. The batsman will see the back of the hand when the ball is released.\n\nIn a scene from John Boorman’s 1987 film \"Hope and Glory\", David Hayman plays a father who, before leaving to fight in WWII, passes on ‘the secret of the googly’ to his young son.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15077", "title": "Indoor rower", "text": "Indoor rower\n\nAn indoor rower, or rowing machine, is a machine used to simulate the action of watercraft rowing for the purpose of exercise or training for rowing. Indoor rowing has become established as a sport in its own right. The term also refers to a participant in this sport.\n\nModern indoor rowers are often known as ergometers (colloquially erg or ergo), an ergometer being a device which measures the amount of work performed. The indoor rower is calibrated to measure the amount of energy the rower is using through their use of the equipment.\n\nChabrias, an Athenian admiral of the 4th century BC, introduced the first rowing machines as supplemental military training devices. \"To train inexperienced oarsmen, Chabrias built wooden rowing frames on shore where beginners could learn technique and timing before they went on board ship.\" \n\nEarly rowing machines are known to have existed from the mid-1800s, a US patent being issued to W.B. Curtis in 1872 for a particular hydraulic based damper design. Machines using linear pneumatic resistance were common around 1900—one of the most popular was the Narragansett hydraulic rower, manufactured in Rhode Island from around 1900–1960. However they did not simulate actual rowing very accurately nor measure power output.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, coaches in many countries began using specially made rowing machines for training and improved power measurement. One original design incorporated a large, heavy, solid iron flywheel with a mechanical friction brake, developed by John Harrison of Leichhardt Rowing Club in Sydney, later to become a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of New South Wales. Harrison, a dual Australian champion beach sprinter who went on to row in the coxless four at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, had been introduced to rowing after a chance meeting with one of the fathers of modern athletic physiological training and testing, and the coach of the Leichhardt \"Guinea Pigs\", Professor Frank Cotton. Professor Cotton had produced a rudimentary friction-based machine for evaluating potential rowers by exhausting them, without any pretence of accurately measuring power output. Harrison realised the importance of using a small braking area with a non-absorbent braking material, combined with a large flywheel. The advantage of this design (produced by Ted Curtain Engineering, Curtain being a fellow Guinea Pig) was the virtual elimination of factors able to interfere with accurate results—for instance ambient humidity or temperature. The Harrison-Cotton machine represents the very first piece of equipment able to accurately quantify human power output; power calculation within an accuracy range as achieved by his machine of less than 1% remains an impressive result today. The friction brake was adjusted according to a rower's weight to give an accurate appraisal of boat-moving ability (drag on a boat is proportional to weight). Inferior copies of Harrison's machine were produced in several countries utilising a smaller flywheel and leather straps—unfortunately the leather straps were sensitive to humidity, and the relatively large braking area made results far less accurate than Harrison's machine. The weight correction factor tended to make them unpopular among rowers of the time. Harrison, arguably the father of modern athletic power evaluation, died in February 2012.\nIn the 1970s, the Gjessing-Nilson ergometer from Norway used a friction brake mechanism with industrial strapping applied over the broad rim of the flywheel. Weights hanging from the strap ensured that an adjustable and predictable friction could be calculated. The cord from the handle mechanism ran over a helical pulley with varying radius, thereby adjusting the gearing and speed of the handle in a similar way to the changing mechanical gearing of the oar through the stroke, derived from changes in oar angle and other factors. This machine was for many years the internationally accepted standard for measurement.\n\nThe first air resistance ergometers were introduced around 1980 by Repco.\n\nIn 1981, Peter and Richard Dreissigacker, and Jonathan Williams, filed for U.S. patent protection, as joint inventors of a \"Stationary Rowing Unit\". The patent was granted in 1983 (US4396188A). The first commercial embodiment of the Concept2 \"rowing ergometer\" (as it came to be known) was the Model A, a fixed-frame sliding-seat design using a bicycle wheel with fins attached for air resistance. The Model B, introduced in 1986, introduced a solid cast flywheel (now enclosed by a cage) and the first digital performance monitor, which proved revolutionary. This machine's capability of accurate calibration combined with easy transportability spawned the sport of competitive indoor rowing, and revolutionised training and selection procedures for watercraft rowing. Later models were the C (1993) and D (2003). \n\nIn 1995, Casper Rekers, a Dutch engineer, was granted a U.S. patent for a \"Dynamically Balanced Rowing Simulator\" (US5382210A). This device differed from the prior art in that the flywheel and footrests are fixed to a carriage, the carriage being free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the frame. The seat is also free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the frame. From the patent Abstract: \"During exercise, the independent seat and energy dissipating unit move apart and then together in a co-ordinated manner as a function of the stroke cycle of the oarsman.\". \"RowPerfect\" and \"Oartec\" are two companies which currently manufacture commercial embodiments of the Rekers device.\n\nAll rowing-machine designs consist of an energy damper or braking mechanism connected to a chain, strap, belt and/or handle. Footrests are attached to the same mounting as the energy damper. Most include a rail which either the seat or the mechanism slide upon. Different machines have a variety of layouts and damping mechanisms, each of which have certain advantages and disadvantages.\n\nCurrently available ergometer (flywheel-type) rowing machines use a spring or elastic cord to take up the pull chain/strap and return the handle. Advances in elastic cord and spring technology have contributed to the longevity and reliability of this strategy, but it still has disadvantages. With time and usage, an elastic element loses its strength and elasticity. Occasionally it will require adjustment, and eventually it will no longer take up the chain with sufficient vigour, and will need to be replaced. The resilience of an elastic cord is also directly proportional to temperature. In an unheated space in a cold climate, an elastic cord equipped rowing ergometer is unusable because the chain take-up is too sluggish. Thus, as the result of several factors, the force required to stretch the elastic cord is a variable, not a constant. This is of little consequence if the exercise device is used for general fitness, but it is an unacknowledged problem, the \"dirty little secret\", of indoor rowing competitions. The electronic monitor only measures the user input to the flywheel. It does not measure the energy expenditure to stretch the elastic cord. A claim of a \"level playing field\" cannot be made when a resistance variable exists (that of the elastic cord) which is not measured or monitored in any way (see more on this in \"Competitions\" section).\n\nIn the patent record, means are disclosed whereby the chain/cable take-up and handle return are accomplished without the use of a spring or elastic cord, thereby avoiding the stated disadvantages and defects of this broadly used method. One example is the Gjessing-Nilson device described above. Partially discernable in the thumbnail photo, it utilizes a cable wrapped around a helical pulley on the flywheel shaft, the ends of this cable being connected to opposite ends of a long pole to which a handle is fixed. The obvious disadvantage of this system is the forward space requirement to accommodate the extension of the handle pole at the \"catch\" portion of the stroke. The advantage is that, except for small transmission losses, all of the user's energy output is imparted to the flywheel, where it can be accurately measured, not split between the flywheel and an elastic cord of variable, unmeasured resistance. If a similar system were installed on all rowing ergometers used in indoor rowing competitions, consistency between machines would be guaranteed because the variability factor of elastic cord resistance would be eliminated, and this would therefore ensure that the monitor displayed actual user energy input. \n\nIn a 1988 US patent (US4772013A), Elliot Tarlow discloses another non-elastic chain/cable take-up and handle return strategy. Described and depicted is a continuous chain/cable loop that passes around the flywheel sprocket and around and between fixed pulleys and sprockets positioned fore and aft on the device. The handle is secured in the middle of the exposed upper horizontal section of the chain/cable loop. Although somewhat lacking in aesthetics, the Tarlow device does eliminate the stated disadvantages and defects of the ubiquitous elastic cord handle return. Tarlow further argues that the disclosed method provides an improved replication of rowing because in actual rowing the rower is not assisted by the contraction of a spring or elastic cord during the \"recovery\" portion of the stroke. The rower must push the oar handle forward against wind and oarlock resistance in preparation for the next stroke. Tarlow asserts that the invention replicates that resistance.\n\nA third non-elastic handle return strategy is disclosed in US patent, \"Gravity Return Rowing Exercise Device\" (US9878200 B2, 2018) granted to Robert Edmondson. As stated in the patent document, the utilization of gravity (ie: a weight) to take up the chain and return the handle eliminates the inevitable variability of handle return force associated with an elastic cord system and thereby ensures consistency between machines.\n\nMachines with a digital display calculate the user's power by measuring the speed of the flywheel during the stroke and then recording the rate at which it decelerates during the recovery. Using this and the known moment of inertia of the flywheel, the computer is able to calculate speed, power, distance and energy usage. Some ergometers can be connected to a personal computer using software, and data on individual exercise sessions can be collected and analysed. In addition, some software packages allows users to connect multiple ergometers either directly or over the internet for virtual races and workouts.\n\nAt the current state of the art, indoor rowers which utilize flywheel resistance can be categorized into two motion types. In both types, the rowing movement of the user causes the footrests and the seat to move further and closer apart in co-ordination with the user's stroke. The difference between the two types is in the movement, or absence of movement, of the footrests relative to ground.\n\nThe first type is characterized by the Dreissigacker/Williams device (referenced above). With this type the flywheel and footrests are fixed to a stationary frame, and the seat is free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the stationary frame. Therefore, during use, the seat moves relative to the footrests and also relative to ground, while the flywheel and footrests remain stationary relative to ground. This type is sometimes referred to as a \"stationary\" or \"fixed head\" rowing ergometer.\n\nThe second type is characterized by the Rekers device (referenced above). With this type, both the seat and the footrests are free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to a stationary frame. Therefore, during use, the seat and the footrests move relative to each other, and both also move relative to ground. This type is often referred to as a \"dynamic\" rowing ergometer, although \"dynamically balanced\" would be a more accurate description. A static indoor rower of the Dreissigacker/Williams type, if mounted on wheels or slides to enable forward and rearward movement of the unit, is by definition \"dynamically balanced\". The accessory slide tracks correspond to the referenced stationary frame of the Rekers device. Casper Rekers is nevertheless credited as the first to utilize this motion type in a rowing ergometer. The effect, for the user, is a more realistic \"on the water\" sensation than that provided by a \"stationary\" rowing ergometer because the \"dynamically balanced\" type more closely replicates actual rowing wherein the seat and the boat move relative to each other, and both move relative to the water.\n\nIncluded within the \"dynamically balanced\" category are indoor rowers in which the footrests and flywheel are fixed to a moveable carriage, and also those in which the footrests alone are fixed to the moveable carriage, the carriage in both cases being free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the stationary frame. The described device in which the flywheel is fixed to and moves with the carriage and footrests (the Rekers design) is sometimes referred to as a \"floating head\" rowing ergometer.\n\nIndoor rowers which utilize a pivoting handle or handles to simulate a sweep or sculling stroke (thus referred to as \"rowing simulators\"), can be of the above described \"stationary\" or \"dynamically balanced\" type of rowing ergometer. The Coffey rowing machine, designed by Olympic silver medalist rower, Calvin Coffey, can be configured to enable a sweep or a sculling stroke, in either a \"stationary\" or \"dynamically balanced\" mode. The flywheel is positioned horizontally at the rear of the device, under the seat rails (US patents: US4743011A 1988; US7862484B1; Inventor: Calvin Coffey). \n\nThe Rekers rowing ergometer (referenced above) is described in the title of the patent document as \"dynamically balanced\", rather than simply \"dynamic\", as is common among users. \"Dynamically balanced\" is the accurate description, for the following reason: During the drive portion of the stroke, since the sliding carriage to which the footrests are attached, and the sliding seat, can both move independently fore and aft on a rail or rails, therefore the straightening of the user's legs causes the footrests to slide forward, and simultaneously causes the seat to slide rearward. However, since the combined mass of the seat and user is considerably greater than the combined mass of the footrests and sliding carriage (and flywheel, if it is part of the sliding footrests assembly), therefore the rearward movement of the seat and user, relative to ground, is much less than the forward movement of the footrests and carriage assembly, relative to ground. During the recovery portion of the stroke, this difference in mass has the same effect. The sliding footrests carriage, and the sliding seat carrying the user move proportionately the same distances relative to ground as during the drive as they return to their starting positions. Thus, during use, the combined mass of the footrest and sliding carriage, and the combined mass of the user and sliding seat, move towards and away from each other, as they oscillate about their common centre of gravity. To ensure the linked movement of these two masses remain centred on the device, the rail or rails upon which they slide are sloped upward slightly at their front and rear ends. Alternatively, elastic cords or springs attached to the seat and footrests can ensure such centering. \n\nIn addition to the aforementioned improved \"on the water\" sensation experienced by the user of a \"dynamically balanced\" rowing ergometer, there are also bio-mechanical and power delivery advantages. Bio-mechanically, throughout all phases of the stroke, the user's mass moves only a small distance relative to ground, therefore the user is not subject to the inertial stresses associated with the abrupt fore and aft directional changes experienced on a \"stationary\" rowing ergometer. With respect to power delivery: Casper Rekers, inventor of the \"dynamically balanced\" rowing ergometer, \"performed tests comparing the indicated power output of a \"stationary\" versus a \"dynamic\" rowing ergometer - the subject gained 10-20% power output in the second case, representing additional power that could be applied to the flywheel instead of accelerating the bodyweight\" of the user on the seat rail.\n\nPiston resistance comes from hydraulic cylinders that are attached to the handles of the rowing machine. The length of the rower handles on this class of rower is typically adjustable, however, during the row the handle length is fixed which in turn fixes the trajectory that the hands must take on the stroke and return, thus making the stroke less accurate than is possible on the other types of resistance models where it is possible to emulate the difference in hand height on the stroke and return. Furthermore, many models in this class have a fixed seat position that eliminates the leg drive which is the foundation of competitive on water rowing technique. Because of the compact size of the pistons and mechanical simplicity of design, these models are typically not as large or as expensive as the others types.\n\nBraked flywheel resistance models comprise magnetic, air and water resistance rowers. These machines are mechanically similar since all three types use a handle connected to a flywheel by rope, chain, or strap to provide resistance to the user – the types differ only in braking mechanism. Because the handle is attached to the resistance source by rope or similarly flexible media, the trajectory of the hands in the vertical plane is free making it possible for the rower to emulate the hand height difference between the stroke and the return. Most of these models have the characteristic sliding seat typical of competitive on-the-water boats.\n"}

{"id": "1015988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1015988", "title": "Johan Cruyff Arena", "text": "Johan Cruyff Arena\n\nThe Johan Cruyff Arena ( ; officially stylised as \"Johan Cruijff ArenA\") is the main stadium of the Dutch capital city of Amsterdam. Built from 1993 to 1996 at a cost equivalent to €140 million, it is the largest stadium in the country. The stadium was previously known as the Amsterdam Arena (stylised as \"Amsterdam ArenA\") until the 2018–19 football season, when the stadium was officially renamed in honour of legendary Dutch footballer Johan Cruyff after he passed away in March 2016.\n\nThe stadium is the home of the association football club AFC Ajax since 1996. In addition, it was the home of the now-defunct American football club Amsterdam Admirals (1997–2007). It was one of the stadiums used during Euro 2000, and also held the 1998 Champions League and 2013 Europa League finals. The stadium will also host three group stage matches and one match in the round of 16 of the Euro 2020.\n\nBoth international and Dutch artists have given concerts in the stadium, including Coldplay, Take That, Celine Dion, Madonna, Michael Jackson, André Hazes, David Bowie, AC/DC, One Direction, The Rolling Stones, Beyoncé and Rihanna. The dance event Sensation was held in the stadium every year, up until the final edition in 2017.\n\nThe stadium has a retractable roof combined with a grass surface. It has a capacity of 54,990 people during football matches, and of 68,000 people during concerts if a centre-stage setup is used (the stage in the middle of the pitch); for end-stage concerts, the capacity is 50,000, and for concerts for which the stage is located in the east side of the stadium, the capacity is 35,000. It held UEFA five-star stadium status, which was superseded by a new system of classification.\n\nAmsterdam was one of six cities that bid to host the 1992 Summer Olympics. In 1986, a new Olympic stadium was designed, with a football field and an athletics track. It was to be built in the area of Strandvliet in Amsterdam Zuidoost. After Amsterdam lost the bid to Barcelona in October 1986, the plans for the new stadium were abandoned. In 1987, the Stichting Amsterdam Sportstad (English: \"Amsterdam Sports City Foundation\") was established, which made new plans for a sports stadium with an all-seated capacity of 55,000. In 1990, a new design was made based on both previous designs, with a football field, an athletics track, and completely covered by a roof. By this time, AFC Ajax needed a new stadium, as their old stadium, De Meer, was far too small for most of Ajax's games. For several years, Ajax had moved its more important games to Olympisch Stadion.\n\nOnce more, the design was altered – the athletics track was removed, the capacity was reduced to 50,000 seats, and the fixed roof was replaced by a retractable roof. In 1992, the Government of Amsterdam authorised the plans for the stadium with a \"Transferium\" where people could transfer from their car to various forms of public transportation. In 1993, the Government of Amsterdam changed the development plan of the location and gave a permit to build the stadium.\n\nThe first pile of the deep foundation of the stadium was placed on 26 November 1993. The construction work, undertaken by Ballast Nedam and Royal BAM Group, took almost three years. The highest point of the building was reached on 24 February 1995, after the roof construction was raised. The fly-over from the public road to the parking facilities was opened on 13 March 1996. The stadium received 180,000 visitors during the construction work, until the stadium was closed from 1 July 1996 until the opening ceremony. The stadium was officially opened on 14 August 1996 by Queen Beatrix.\n\nQueen Beatrix opened the stadium by making a curtain fall inside the stadium. This revealed the world's largest painting \"De Zee\" (English: \"The Sea\") of . Two-dimensional ships were placed on the sea representing the clubs in the \"Eredivisie\". Tina Turner opened the stadium with three concerts with 160,000 people in the arena, from her world breaking Wildest Dreams Tour. Trijntje Oosterhuis sang the hymn \"De Zee\", composed for the opening ceremony by John Ewbank. An eight-day torch relay with 375 runners over 1400 kilometres through the Netherlands reached the stadium. The first runner was Johan Cruyff starting in the old stadium De Meer, and the last runner was Frank Rijkaard arriving in the new stadium. After the grass was revealed and the roof opened, an inaugural football match was played between AFC Ajax and Milan.\n\nThe construction of the stadium cost €140 million.\n\nThe stadium combines a retractable roof with a grass surface. This caused some problems in the beginning: the grass rolls would not grow in the shade of the open roof and had to be replaced up to four times a year.\n\nIn September 2015, plans were presented to renovate the stadium's facade. The renovation should provide better quality and service to visitors by widening the walkway rings around the stadium, creating more room for the visitors and for new facilities (the number of seats remains the same). As a result, the outside of the stadium transforms from a concave shape to a convex shape, drastically altering its appearance. The renovation is planned to be completed in 2020, when 4 matches of the UEFA Euro 2020 championship will be played in the Arena.\n\nConstruction works started in June 2017. The first phase is to renovate the east side of the stadium, where construction of the new facade was completed in April 2018.\n\nOn 25 April 2017, it was announced that the Amsterdam Arena would be renamed to \"Johan Cruijff Arena\" in memory of Ajax legend Johan Cruyff. Later that year, on 9 August, it was stated that the name change would take place on 25 October 2017. However, this was postponed as that date proved to be infeasable due to the many matters that needed to be settled, such as arranging compensation for possible loss of income, transferring part of the shares from the municipality of Amsterdam to Ajax and having a discussion with the Cruyff family.\n\nOn 5 April 2018, it was announced that the stadium would officially change name at the start of the 2018–19 football season. The stadium's new logo was revealed on 25 April 2018, the birthday of Johan Cruyff. According to the spokeswoman of Cruyff's family, the original Dutch spelling of his name (\"Cruijff\") was chosen for the stadium's official name \"to stay close to the Dutch Johan\". The 2018–19 football season started in August 2018.\n\nThe stadium's original architect is Rob Schuurman (from the Netherlands). Its all-seated capacity is 54,990. During music concerts, the stadium has a maximum capacity of 68,000 visitors. The parking capacity of the \"Transferium\" is 500 cars (inside); there are an additional 12,000 spots outside.\n\nThe Johan Cruyff Arena is one of two stadiums in the Netherlands that is rated as Category 4 by UEFA, the other being the Feijenoord Stadion in Rotterdam.\n\nThe Ajax Museum is located in the stadium, which shows Ajax's more than 100 years of history.\n\nThe nearest train station is Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena.\n\nThe inaugural match was between the home team Ajax and Milan, which ended with a 3–0 win for Milan. The first goal was scored by Dejan Savićević.\n\nThe stadium is the home of AFC Ajax in the Eredivisie. The 1998 UEFA Champions League Final when Real Madrid defeated Juventus, was played in the arena. It was also one of the venues in UEFA Euro 2000.\n\nThe stadium hosts most of the Dutch national team's matches, though the Netherlands no longer has a dedicated national stadium for football.\n\nIn addition, the arena hosts friendly matches for other Dutch national football teams.\nAfter the death of Rinus Michels in 2005, Ajax fans tried to convince the stadium's board to rebrand the stadium as the Rinus Michels Stadium. The board declined. At every Ajax home game, however, fans bring a large banner displaying the words 'Rinus Michels Stadion'. The stadium was the host of 2013 UEFA Europa League Final, when Chelsea defeated Benfica 2–1.\n\nThe Johan Cruyff Arena is one of the stadiums that will host matches for UEFA Euro 2020.\n\nThe stadium was also the home of the American football team Amsterdam Admirals of the NFL Europe, until the National Football League (NFL) ended its European competition in June 2007. The team played over 50 matches in the stadium from 1997 to 2007. World Bowl IX was played at the Arena in 2001, when the Berlin Thunder defeated the Barcelona Dragons.\n\nAs kickboxing is the most popular combat sport in the Netherlands, the It's Showtime and K-1 promotions have held a number of fight cards at the arena. Many of the sport's biggest stars such as Peter Aerts, Semmy Schilt, Badr Hari and Ernesto Hoost have fought there.\n\nDespite frequent complaints about the acoustics of the Arena, concerts are often held in the stadium.\n\nTina Turner was the first to perform at the arena during her \"Wildest Dreams Tour\", with more than 157,000 people attending the three sold-out concerts on 6–8 September 1996.\n\nMichael Jackson performed at the arena during his \"HIStory World Tour\" in five sold-out concerts, on 28, 30 September; 2 October 1996 and 8 & 10 June 1997, for a total audience of 250,000 fans.\n\nThe Rolling Stones performed at the stadium eight times: the first, the second, the third, the fourth and the fifth were on 29 June and 1, 2, 5 and 6 July 1998 during their Bridges to Babylon Tour, in front of a total sold out crowd of 261,277 people. The sixth and the seventh were on 19 August – 22 September 2003 during their Licks Tour. The eighth one was on 31 July 2006 during their A Bigger Bang.\n\nBackstreet Boys performed at the stadium on 5 June 1999 during Into the Millennium Tour.\n\nThe largest number of visitors visited the Arena for the concert of Céline Dion during her Let's Talk About Love World Tour. 68,083 spectators heard Dion on a heart-shaped stage in the middle of the stadium.\n\nBon Jovi performed at the stadium four times: the first and the second were on 5 and 6 June 2001 during their One Wild Night Tour. The third one was on 3 June 2003 during their Bounce Tour. The fourth one was on 13 June 2008 during their Lost Highway Tour, in front of a sold out crowd of 34,512 people.\n\nRobbie Williams played the venue eight times: twice in July 2003 as part of Weekends of Mass Distraction; four dates in June 2006, as part of his Close Encounters Tour; and on 13 July 2013 during the Take The Crown Stadium Tour. He also performed on 18 July 2011 as member of Take That during their Progress Live tour.\n\nDavid Bowie performed a concert in the arena as part of his A Reality Tour on 11 June 2004.\n\nGenesis performed at the stadium on 1 July 2007 during their . The performances of \"Turn It On Again\" and \"No Son of Mine\" were recorded for the group's live album \"Live over Europe 2007\".\n\nU2 performed at the stadium seven times: the first, the second and the third were on 13, 15, and 16 July 2005 during their Vertigo Tour, in front of a total sold out crowd of 165,516 people. The fourth and the fifth were on 20 and 21 July 2009 during their U2 360° Tour, in front of a total sold out crowd of 125,886 people. The band's sixth and seventh shows were for their The Joshua Tree Tour 2017 on 29 and 30 July 2017.\n\nMadonna has performed at three different dates, with all tickets sold out. There were two presentations by the Confessions Tour in 2006 and one presentation by Sticky & Sweet Tour in 2008.\n\nDutch music group De Toppers have played the venue 42 times since 2005. No other act has performed in the arena that often.\n\nIn October 2008, the stadium was home to Dutch children's group Kinderen voor Kinderen. The Arena was selected because of the seating requirement for the group's new format of concert called the \"Mega Spektakel\". The group had two concerts in the stadium on the same day due to high volume of people, mostly children that attended.\n\nAC/DC performed a show on 23 June 2009 as part of their Black Ice World Tour\n\nThe stadium is also host to dance event Sensation.\n\nAndré Rieu and his orchestra plus about 650 brass instrument players had a huge concert in 2011.\n\nMuse performed a show on 4 June 2013 as part of their The 2nd Law World Tour.\n\nOn 8 September 2013 former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters will perform a show of his The Wall Live Concert Tour.\n\nOn 24 and 25 June 2014, boy band One Direction performed in the arena as a part of their Where We Are Tour.\n\nRihanna performed at the venue as a part of her Anti World Tour on 17 June 2016.\n\nColdplay performed 2 concerts on 23 June 2016 and 24 June 2016 as a part of their A Head Full of Dreams Tour.\n\nBeyoncé performed at the venue on 16 July 2016 as a part of her Formation World Tour.

Dow and built in 1960 for $3.5 million (equivalent to $ million today).\n\nAs of the 2015-2016 season, McMorran will be the home of the Port Huron Prowlers of the Federal Hockey League. Previous hockey tenants include the Port Huron Flags (various incarnations), Port Huron Wings, Port Huron Border Cats, Port Huron Beacons, Port Huron Icehawks and Port Huron Fighting Falcons. In addition, the arena has also been home to three prior indoor football teams; the Port Huron Pirates, Port Huron Predators and Port Huron Patriots.\n\nThe arena seats 3,400 for ice hockey and indoor football, and 4,800 for concerts. The arena floor measures 85 feet by 185 feet (27 by 62 meters). The dasher boards have 8-foot glass on the ends and 4-foot glass on the sides for ice hockey. The arena is also used for conventions, circuses, ice shows, trade shows, and banquets, among other events.The arena has hosted many major headlining musicians throughout the years such as KISS, Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, Van Halen, Bon Jovi, Rush, Ozzy Osbourne, Ratt, Johnny Cash.\n\nThe 1998 opening of RBC Centre in Sarnia, Ontario sent most of the arena's concert business across the St. Clair River, which separates Port Huron from Sarnia. However, in 2010 McMorran started to rejuvenate their concert lineup with the band Third Eye Blind. In 2012, McMorran Arena and the adjacent pavilion were used for the Devil's Asylum haunted house. As a result, the Fighting Falcons began their season on the road.\n\nThe pavilion features of space for sporting events, trade shows, banquets, meetings, and conventions. In 2016, the city of Port Huron sold the pavilion to St. Clair County Community College for $1. Following the transaction, the Port Huron Minor Hockey Association, which was housed at the Pavilion, merged with the Blue Water Hockey Association, which is run out of Glacier Pointe Ice Complex in Port Huron. SC4 is renovating the building, and will open it in October as the SC4 Fieldhouse. It will serve as the home to SC4's athletic teams. It will also be available for community use, hosting tournaments, showcases and camps in various sports and at various levels.\n\nThe 1,157-seat theatre is used for Broadway shows, movies, concerts, and other stage events. It features not only excellent acoustics and sight lines, but also a stage curtain, also designed by Alden B. Dow. It is home to the International Symphony Orchestra and the Port Huron Civic Theatre.\n\nIn addition, there is a meeting room and a lounge at the complex. Outside the building is a clock and the Night and Day fountain, both by sculptor Marshall Fredericks.\n\n\n"}

It has a capacity of 40,192 seats and is the centerpiece of Vietnam's National Sports Complex. It was officially opened in September 2003 and was the main venue for the Southeast Asian Games later that year, hosting the opening and closing ceremony as well as the men's football and athletics events.\n\nThe stadium is home to the Vietnam national football team, and hosts its home international friendly matches. It was also home to Thể Công from 2005 to 2008. It is currently home to Viettel F.C., with the stadium being its home since 2010.\n\nLocated 10 kilometres north-west of central Hanoi, the 40,000-seat stadium is the second biggest in the country in terms of capacity and was built at a cost of US$53 million. Arched roofs cover the grandstands on the east and west sides of the arena, providing shelter for half of the seats. \nThe area provides training facilities for the teams with two football training grounds conveniently located next to the stadium.\n\nIdeas for a new national stadium in Vietnam were marked up in 1998 as the government conducted a prefeasibility study for a national sports complex. In July 2000, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Văn Khải approved a project of a stadium at the heart of Vietnam's National Sports Complex in preparation for hosting the 2003 Southeast Asian Games. Four firms, namely Hanoi International Group (HISG - China), Philipp Holzmann (Germany), Bouygues (France) and Lemna-Keystone (United States), participated in the bidding of the stadium's construction. The process was controversial due to violations of technical and financial requirements in HISG and Holzmann's bids, corruption allegations involving a French donation as well as the intransparency in the panel's decision making. In the end, HISG won the bid and signed a commitment contract on August 14, 2001.\n\nConstruction on the stadium started in 2002. During the developmental phase, the stadium was referred to as \"Sân vận động Trung tâm\" (\"central stadium\"). The stadium was architecturally complete in June 2003. In August 2003, the stadium was officially named \"Mỹ Đình National Stadium\", taking after the name of the commune area the stadium is located within. It was inaugurated on September 2, 2003 to coincide with Vietnam's National Day.\n\nMỹ Đình has 4 stands. The A & B stands (or east and west stands, respectively) are covered each by an arched roof weighing 2,300 tonnes. These two stands have two tiers and are tall while the C & D stands (or south and north stands) are single-tiered and tall. In total, the stadium has a capacity of 40,192 seats, including 450 VIP seats and 160 seats for journalists.\n\nThe playing grass field has a size of 105m x 67m, surrounded by an 8-lane athletics track and other athletics facilities. \nThe stadium officially opened on September 2, 2003 with the opening friendly match between the Vietnam U23 and Shanghai Shenhua from Chinese Super League.\n\nIt hosted the 2003 Southeast Asian Games (opening ceremony, football and athletics, closing ceremony) and 2003 ASEAN Para Games.\n\nIn July 2007, Mỹ Đình Stadium hosted the Group B of 2007 AFC Asian Cup along with Quân khu 7 Stadium (Ho Chi Minh City), quarter-final match (Japan vs Australia) and semi-final match (Japan vs Saudi Arabia).\n\nMỹ Đình Stadium held the opening ceremony of the 2009 Asian Indoor Games from October 30, 2009 to November 8.\n\nIn December 2010, it held Group B of 2010 AFF Suzuki Cup from December 2 to December 8.\n\nIn addition, this stadium held many domestic and international football competitions:\n\nThe three runners-up from the third round groups played each other at a neutral venue on 25, 27 and 29 March 2012. Vietnam was later chosen by the AFC Competitions Committee as the neutral venue, with games played at Hanoi's Mỹ Đình Stadium.\n\nMỹ Đình National Stadium has hosted many entertainment events. On January 10, 2010, VTV held a concert featuring local famous singers. On March 27, 2010, a MTV Exit concert was held here with the appearance of Super Junior, a Korean boyband, Kate Miller, an Australian singer along with many Vietnamese singers. Recently, on October 1, 2011, the Irish boyband Westlife put a stop here as a part of their Gravity Tour; about 11,000 people attended the concert. The stadium was also the starting line of The Amazing Race Vietnam 2012. On May 26, 2013, MTV Exit held a concert featuring the Canadian pop punk band Simple Plan to raise awareness about human trafficking and modern slavery.\n\nThe stadium has also been the venue for various K-Pop concerts. It was the venue for a special concert of MBC's Music Core on December 8, 2012 and KBS's Music Bank World Tour on March 28, 2015.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50049335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50049335", "title": "Respiratory adaptation", "text": "Respiratory adaptation\n\nRespiratory adaptation is the specific changes that the respiratory system undergoes in response to the demands of physical exertion. Intense physical exertion, such as that involved in fitness training, places elevated demands on the respiratory system. Over time, this results in respiratory changes as the system adapts to these requirements. These changes ultimately result in an increased exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which is accompanied by an increase in metabolism. Respiratory adaptation is a physiological determinant of peak endurance performance, and in elite athletes, the pulmonary system is often a limiting factor to exercise under certain conditions.\n\nRespiratory adaptation begins almost immediately after the initiation of the physical stress associated with exercise. This triggers signals from the motor cortex that stimulate the respiratory center of the brain stem, in conjunction with feedback from the proprioreceptors in the muscles and joints of the active limbs.\n\nWith higher intensity training, breathing rate is increased in order to allow more air to move in and out of the lungs, which enhances gas exchange. Endurance training typically results in an increase in the respiration rate.\n\nWith adaptation, lung capacity is increased over time, allowing a greater quantity of air to move in and out. Endurance training typically results in an increase in tidal volume.\n\nMuscles involved in respiration, including the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, increase in strength and endurance. This results in an improved ability to breathe in more air, for longer amounts of time with less fatigue. Aerobic training typically improves the endurance of respiratory muscles, whereas anaerobic training tends to increase the size and strength of respiratory muscles. \n\nExercise increases the vascularization of the lungs. This allows the more blood flow in and out of the lungs. This enhances the uptake of oxygen, since there is greater surface area for blood to bind with haemoglobin.\n\nRespiratory adaptation results an increase in the number of alveoli, which enables more gas exchange to occur. This is coupled with an increase in alveolar oxygen tension.\n"}
{"id": "513708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=513708", "title": "Setup man", "text": "Setup man\n\nIn baseball, a setup man (or set-up man, also sometimes referred to as a setup pitcher or setup reliever) is a relief pitcher who regularly pitches before the closer. They commonly pitch the eighth inning, with the closer pitching the ninth.\n\nAs closers were reduced to one-inning specialists, setup men became more prominent. Setup pitchers often come into the game with the team losing or the game tied. They are usually the second best relief pitcher on a team, behind the closer. After closers became one-inning pitchers, primarily in the ninth inning, setup pitchers became more highly valued. A pitcher who succeeds in this role is often promoted to a closer. Setup men are paid less than closers and mostly make less than the average Major League salary.\n\nThe most common statistic used to evaluate relievers is the save. Due to the definition of the statistic, setup men are rarely in position to record a save even if they pitch well, but they can be charged with a blown save if they pitch poorly. The hold statistic was developed to help acknowledge a setup man's effectiveness, but it is not an official Major League Baseball (MLB) statistic.\n\nHistorically, setup men were rarely selected to MLB All-Star Games, with the nod usually going to closers with large save totals. From 1971 through 2000, only six relievers with fewer than five saves at midseason were selected as All-Stars. There were 10 such players from 2001 through 2009. In 2015, the majority of the American League's All-Star relievers were not closers, outnumbered 4–3. Setup men who have been named All-Stars multiple times include Justin Duchscherer, Tyler Clippard, Dellin Betances, and Andrew Miller.\n\nFrancisco Rodriguez, who was a setup pitcher for the Anaheim Angels in 2002, tied starting pitcher Randy Johnson's Major League Baseball record for wins in a single postseason after recording his fifth victory in the 2002 World Series.\n\nTim McCarver wrote that the New York Yankees in 1996 \"revolutionized baseball\" with Mariano Rivera, \"a middle reliever who should have been on the All-Star team and who was a legitimate MVP candidate.\" He finished third in the voting for the American League (AL) Cy Young Award, the highest a setup man has finished. That season, Rivera primarily served as a setup pitcher for closer John Wetteland, typically pitching in the seventh and eighth inning of games before Wetteland pitched in the ninth. Their effectiveness gave the Yankees a 70–3 win–loss record that season when leading after six innings. McCarver said the Yankees played \"six-inning games\" that year, with Rivera dominating for two innings and Wetteland closing out the victory.\n\nIllustrating the general trend, both Rivera and Rodriguez were moved to closer soon after excelling as setup men.\n"}

He played for the Detroit Pistons, Philadelphia 76ers, Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers all of the NBA and the Denver Rockets of the ABA. Mix represented the 76ers in the 1975 NBA All-Star Game. Mix made it to the NBA Finals four times overall, three times with the 76ers (1977, 1980, 1982), but never won an NBA title. In 1983, when the 76ers did win the NBA title, Mix was a bench player for the Los Angeles Lakers, who were swept by the 76ers.\n\nFollowing his retirement as a player, became basketball head coach at his alma mater, the University of Toledo. In his one year in the position during the 1984-1985 season, the team went 6-20. Afterwards, Mix spent 22 years as a color commentator on the 76ers' television broadcasts.

Dating back to 1878, it is the oldest amateur event in golf, as the first Amateur Championship was played in 1885. It is also the oldest team event in English golf. Scottish team matches were common after 1849, and included St Andrews University matches against Fife artisan clubs. The Varsity Match was most recently contested in March 2018, at Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, and was won by Cambridge.\n\nThe first University Golf Match was played on 6 March 1878 at Wimbledon Common, courtesy of London Scottish Golf Club, which hosted the fixture for 19 years until it moved to Royal St George's Golf Club in 1897. The match was contested by four singles matches, and used the holes up method of scoring. Oxford, led by Horace Hutchinson, won by a margin of 24 holes. Up to and including 2013, 124 University Golf Matches have been played.\n\nIn 1898 the Oxford and Cambridge Golfing Society (OCGS) was founded; members qualify by virtue of their participation in the University Golf Match. Since 1920, the OCGS has hosted the President's Putter, an annual match-play competition for its members held at Rye Golf Club, in Rye, East Sussex.\n\nUntil the 1890s there were very few golf courses in England, and none of appropriate quality in the Oxford and Cambridge areas. The University Match was initially played on Wimbledon Common, which, along with Royal Blackheath, was one of just a handful of courses in the London area at the time.\n\nSince then, the University Golf Match has been played at courses all over the United Kingdom, including Royal St George's, Royal Cinque Ports, Royal Liverpool, Muirfield, Ganton, Walton Heath, Hunstanton, Aldeburgh, Royal Porthcawl, and Sunningdale.\n\nThe choice of venue alternates between the teams, and the match is traditionally played every five years at Rye (last played at Rye in 2014).\n\nThe 2019 Match will be played at Rye Golf Club.\n\nMen - Each team comprises ten players plus two reserves. The reserves traditionally play the \"Dinner Match\" on the Thursday of the Varsity Match week: an 18-hole alternate shot foursomes match, followed by an 18-hole singles match. The losing team is responsible for paying the bill for the Varsity Match dinner on the Saturday evening.\n\nThe University Match itself is contested over the course of two days. Five 36-hole foursomes matches are played on the Friday, and ten 36-hole singles matches are played on the Saturday.\n\nLadies – 18-hole foursomes followed by 18 singles contested between 6 ladies from each team, with one reserve. Although the reserved play a match the score does not count towards the final score. The Ladies' match is held on the Tuesday of Varsity week as the beginning of the matches.\n\n"}
