The playing field itself is named George Cole Field, in honor of the former Arkansas athletic director. George Cole Field was also the name of the Razorbacks' old home stadium, in use from 1975 to March 1996. Baum Stadium replaced George Cole Field in April 1996. The stadium is located one-half mile from the main Arkansas campus, which lies across Razorback Road from the stadium.\n\nBaum Stadium officially opened in 1996. It was designed by Populous (formerly HOK Sport), an architecture firm that has also designed several major league stadiums. Its first game was a 9-2 Arkansas win over Auburn on April 13, 1996. The stadium was dedicated prior to a 9-3 Arkansas win over Alabama on May 3, 1996.\n\nIn 1998, Baum Stadium was named the country's number one college baseball facility by Baseball America, and claimed the top spot again in 2018. In 1999, Arkansas won the regular season Southeastern Conference title and had an average home attendance of 3,780 spectators, the sixth-highest total in Division I college baseball. That year, the stadium hosted an NCAA regional.\n\nPrior to the 2003 season, 2,600 chairback seats were added (1,300 down each foul line). In addition, the hitting and pitching cages were enclosed to allow year-round access. During the 2003 and 2004 seasons, renovations took place. Coaches offices and eight luxury boxes were added above the seating areas. Also, a new scoreboard was built in right field. The scoreboard stands 51 feet high and is 76 feet wide and features four classic brick pillars. Also in 2004, a natural grass surface was added, replacing the AstroTurf field that had been in place since the stadium opened. Rye grass was initially used for the 2004 season but was in 2005 replaced by a hybrid bermuda grass. In November 2006, the stadium underwent its third expansion since the 2003 season. The expansion includes 20 luxury boxes, 1,500 chairback seats, and a new outfield area to bring the stadium's capacity 10,737 spectators. The expansions have made the stadium the second biggest, by listed capacity, in the Southeastern Conference.\n\nBaum Stadium hosted its first #1 vs. #1 matchup ever on April 7, 2009, a 7-3 Razorbacks victory over the Arizona State Sun Devils. The Hogs were #1 in Collegiate Baseball's poll, with ASU pulling a top ranking from Baseball America and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches' Poll. The very next night, the Hogs set a then Baum Stadium record for attendance at 11,044 when they completed the sweep of the Sun Devils.\n\nBefore the 2016 season, another new scoreboard was unveiled, becoming the largest video board in collegiate baseball.\n\nDuring the weekend of May 4, 2007, Baum Stadium set a record attendance mark for a regular season three-game conference series. In the series against LSU, a total of 29,971 spectators attended the three-game series, which LSU won two games to one. The stadium's single-game attendance record of 11,103 spectators was set on April 9, 2011, in an 8-7 Arkansas win over LSU.\n\nIn 2013, the Razorbacks ranked 2nd among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 8,335 per home game.\n\n\n"}

The club had been founded by 1790 when it was recorded playing in four minor matches against other town clubs. In 1791, the Prince of Wales Ground became a first-class venue when Sussex played Middlesex.\n\nBrighton played at the Prince of Wales Ground initially. As the towns of Brighton and Hove developed, the land was sold a few years later and the cricket club moved to a new site in Brighton at Temple Fields, which was where Montpelier Crescent is now. From July 1814, the club occupied the Royal New Ground (also known as Thomas Box's Ground), another Brighton venue, which was used for 49 major matches until September 1847 and was the county ground of Sussex CCC in its early years.\n\nThe Brighton club was often representative of Sussex as a county and it ultimately became one of the main interests in the formation of Sussex County Cricket Club in 1839.\n\nBrighton and Hove Cricket Club maintained close connections to Brighton Cricket Club prior to the later becoming Sussex County Cricket Club.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s up to the present day a number of cricket professionals having played for Brighton and Hove have gone on to play for Sussex, Middlesex, Surrey and other counties and countries most notably England, Pakistan and South Africa.\n\nThe brothers Wells Colin and Alan played for Brighton and Hove Cricket Club before Alan represented England against the West Indies and Colin (Sussex), also brothers Willows Alan represented Sussex and Roly Middlesex during the 1970s and 1980s both played for Brighton and Hove along with Tony Graig (England)and Kepler Wessells(Australia and South Africa)along with Andy Dindar (Middlesex)this trend continues to this day with Sussex and other county players representing Brighton and Hove Cricket Club.\n\n"}

The Foundation appointed the British representative of the family, Max Rowe, to turn the dream into reality. He organized a special committee whose members included, among others, the mayor of Jerusalem Teddy Kollek, the Director General of the Ministry of Tourism, Meir de Shalit, and the Foreign Minister at the time, Abba Eban, who headed the committee. The committee commissioned the architect Fred Smith. After design difficulties and efforts to find suitable grass that could withstand the Middle-Eastern climate, the course was built and an irrigation system that included an underground network of pipes was installed.\n\nThe committee set out to draft golfers and to promote the sport in Israel and the golf course abroad. The opening ceremony, in January 1961, was attended by prominent politicians.\n\nThe “Israel Golf Federation” was established in 1965, four years after the opening of the golf club.\n\nThe Club was renovated and upgraded several times over the years, as systems were replaced and modernized, requiring huge financial resources. In 1980, after a new irrigation system was installed at a cost of millions of Israeli shekels, the members convened a general meeting to petition Edmond de Rothschild to increase the annual subsidy for the club. He rejected the demand and transferred management of the club to the Caesarea Development Corporation.\n\nAmong the visitors to the club have been Sean Connery, Kirk Douglas, Frank Sinatra, and Danny Kaye. Notable Israeli figures included Chaim Herzog, who were members. Laetitia Beck took her first steps as a golfer at the Caesarea Golf Course, and it was in Caesarea that her parents, avid golfers, made their home. In 2008 Laetitia was chosen as one of Israel’s “sportswomen of the decade” as part of the State of Israel’s 60th anniversary celebrations.\n\nThe golf course was reopened in 2009, after it was completely redesigned and renovated by architect Pete Dye. As a passionate supporter of environmentally-friendly golf courses, Dye planned the course based on environmental and landscape preservation values. In 2010 the Caesarea golf course joined the list of the Rolex World's Top 1000 Golf Courses.\n\nThe club now spans 6750 sq/m and has two golf courses: a professional 18-hole course, the only one in Israel that meets international standards, and another 9-hole course used mainly for practice and for learning the game. Since 1961 the Club hosts the Maccabiah Games once every four years.\n\n\n"}

The basic camel spin position is defined as one in which the free leg is extended backwards with the knee held above hip level.\n\nMost sources credit the invention of the camel spin to British skater Cecilia Colledge, who first performed it successfully in competition in 1935. Like the layback spin, also invented by Colledge, the camel was originally considered a move for women only.\n\nThe origin of the spin's name is disputed. Most authorities believe that the name originated when a skater performed the spin with her upper body and free leg drooping down, giving the illusion of a hunched camel. According to figure skating coach Gustave Lussi, the spin was invented not by Colledge but by an Australian skater named Campbell, thus explaining that \"Campbell spin\" became corrupted into \"camel spin\".\n\nThe Grafström spin may predate the invention of the \"regular\" camel spin. Although it is named after Gillis Grafström, its best practitioner is said to be Czechoslovakian skater Otto Gold, who won the silver medal at the 1930 European Figure Skating Championships.\n\nDick Button is credited with inventing the flying camel spin in the 1940s. It was originally known as the \"Button camel\".\n\nThe \"illusion spin\" was accidentally invented by Jacqueline du Bief when she lost control on the entrance to a camel spin.\n\nSeveral female pair skaters have suffered head/face injuries after their partners accidentally drifted too close during side-by-side camel spins – Elena Berezhnaya, Jessica Dubé, Mandy Wötzel, and Galina Maniachenko.\n\n\n"}

It is the home of the Oklahoma City Dodgers, the Triple-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball team. The park has seating for up to 13,066 fans and currently utilizes a seating capacity of 9,000 for Dodgers games.\n\nThe stadium frequently hosts the Phillips 66 Big 12 Baseball Tournament and is slated to host the tournament through 2020. The first Big 12 tournament was held at All Sports Stadium in 1997 before moving to Bricktown in 1998. The tournament has been held at Bricktown every year since, except for 2002 and 2004, when it was contested at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, the home park of the Texas Rangers, and in 2015 when Tulsa hosted the tournament. The ballpark also often hosts games of the Bedlam Series, in which the Oklahoma Sooners face the Oklahoma State Cowboys.\n\nThe ballpark also hosts numerous other events both during and outside the baseball season. Those events include the Oklahoma High School Baseball Series in March, the snow tubing WinterFest November-January, a variety of community walks and runs, concerts, parties, corporate outings, meetings, seminars and more.\n\nOklahoma City voters approved a temporary one-cent sales tax increase in December 1993 to fund the Metropolitan Area Projects Plan (MAPS), the city's capital improvement program created to build and upgrade sports, recreation, entertainment, cultural and convention facilities. During the 66 months the sales tax was in effect, more than $309 million was collected.\n\nThe $34 million Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark became the first major MAPS structure to be completed, helping spark a revitalization in Bricktown. Architectural Design Group of Oklahoma City served as the ballpark's architect and Oscar J. Boldt Construction Co., was the ballpark's general contractor.\n\nGroundbreaking ceremonies were held on October 10, 1995, but actual construction did not begin until August 1996 due to escalating construction costs and the redesign of the ballpark by architects. The ballpark opened on April 16, 1998 with the RedHawks falling to the Edmonton Trappers 6-3 in front of a sellout crowd of 14,066 fans.\n\nStatues of legendary baseball players with Oklahoma ties stand before the ballpark's three main gates.\n\nA 7-foot-6 bronze statue of Mickey Mantle stands on a 3-foot granite base at the third base pavilion. Mantle, the New York Yankees' switch-hitting star, was born in Spavinaw and raised in Commerce. The Baseball Hall of Fame centerfielder's statue was dedicated on the ballpark's opening day April 16, 1998.\n\nBaseball Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench grew up in Binger, and a nine-foot statue of the former Cincinnati Reds star greets fans at the ballpark's home plate gate. The statue was dedicated July 27, 2001.\n\nAn 8-foot-8 statue of Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Warren Spahn was dedicated July 2, 2005. The Cy Young Award winning left-hander hailed from Buffalo, New York, but chose to make Broken Arrow and Hartshorne his home after managing the Tulsa Drillers from 1967-71. His statue sits outside of the ballpark's right field gate.\n\nApproximately 480,000 bricks make up the exterior of the ballpark, which mixes retro charm with modern accommodations. A 10-foot tall, 185-foot long LED video board was added in left field for the 2011 season.\n\nChickasaw Bricktown Ballpark has continued to undergo numerous improvements and renovations in recent years.\n\nIn 2012, the Legends Lounge concourse suite was upgraded and the concession stands overhauled. Ballpark signage was upgraded in 2013 and new stairs installed from the concourse to the club and press levels. Three sections of bleachers in left field were replaced with ballpark seats in 2014, while digital screens and drink rails were also added throughout the concourse. \n\nThe Budweiser Deck was constructed and introduced in 2015, replacing the bleacher seating in left field. The ballpark’s playground was relocated and upgraded also for this season. Four 4Topps tables were installed near home plate and the Devon Energy Deck was updated in right field. The Team Store was completely renovated. Also, the audio system and water fountains were upgraded and a center field camera was added.\n\nIn 2016, the center field scoreboard and video board were replaced with a high-definition display. TVs were added at the concession stands and all TVs were upgraded to high definition throughout the ballpark. Six additional 4Topps tables were installed near home plate. The Brickyard area was introduced along the concourse and three sections of bleachers in right field were replaced with ballpark seats. A timeline of franchise history was added to the club level and a train ride was added on the concourse.\n\nThe renovations continued in 2017 with the complete overhaul of the Oklahoma Fidelity Bank Club, formerly the Diamond Lounge, on the club level. The space doubled in square footage and included a new bar design, additional seating capacity, 14 TVs as well as upgraded fixtures, flooring and furniture. A new double suite, allowing the addition of a Champions Membership, was created as well. Furniture throughout all of the entertainment suites on the club and press levels was upgraded. Additional audio, landscaping and security improvements were also made throughout the ballpark. \n\nThe ballpark has received numerous accolades since its opening in 1998, including being named the No. 2 minor league ballpark in the country by \"Baseball America\" the year it opened and being hailed as one of the country's top 10 minor league stadiums in the 2013 10Best Readers' Choice Awards, presented by \"USA Today\".\n\nThe stadium was to be called \"Southwestern Bell Park\". When the general public learned that Bricktown wasn't part of the name, there was an uproar. Due to public pressure, the stadium opened as Southwestern Bell Bricktown Ballpark (later SBC Bricktown Ballpark after Southwestern Bell's name change). In March 2006, the ballpark was renamed AT&T Bricktown Ballpark following the merger between SBC and Old AT&T. After AT&T reevaulated its sports marketing strategy, they gave up naming rights, resulting in the RedHawks Field at Bricktown designation for 2011.\n\nOn April 4, 2012, it was announced that Newcastle Gaming Center in the nearby suburb of Newcastle (owned by the Chickasaw Nation) had purchased naming rights to the ballpark, with the new Newcastle Field at Bricktown name effective immediately. The name change led to public outcry, principally over the prospect of a suburb's name appearing on a city-owned building. One day later on April 5, 2012 (the opening day of the 2012 RedHawks season), Newcastle Gaming Center announced that it would once again rename the ballpark as the Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark.\n\n\nAmateur teams started playing on makeshift fields shortly after the state's Land Run in 1889 in a centrally located site near where Bricktown sits today. In fact, Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark sits within a block of the original site.\n\nThe city's first ballpark structure was Colcord Field, located along the banks of the North Canadian River in 1904, which was home to Oklahoma City's first professional baseball team. The facility was also called Saratoga Park, Liberty Park and Western League Park before being destroyed by flooding in 1923.\n\nHolland Field, located at NW 4 and Pennsylvania, was built in 1924 and later became Tribe Park in the early 1940s and Texas League Park in 1946.\n\nAll Sports Stadium opened in 1962 and was located at NW 10th Street and May at the state fairgrounds. The 89ers played there for 36 seasons.\n\nChickasaw Bricktown Ballpark celebrated its 20th season in 2017 at which numerous festivities were held throughout the season to mark this milestone, including a kickoff luncheon prior to the season featuring former OKC mayors and PCL President Branch B. Rickey. A commemorative brick display benefitting the OKC Dodgers Baseball Foundation was unveiled on the Mickey Mantle Plaza and fans were able to vote online throughout the season to select an All-Ballpark Team and determine the best players to step on the field at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark. Ceremonial first pitches took place throughout the season, players wore special 20th Season jerseys, new merchandise was introduced in the Team Store and a 20th Season Stein was given away to fans to help mark the special occasion.\n\n"}

Some people consider the El Cajon Boulevard Riot one of the first major youth riots of the 1960s.\n\nThe riot began during the evening of August 20, 1960 as an organized protest over the closing of Hourglass Field, an unused United States Navy airfield, to drag racing. The drag racing had been organized by the San Diego Timing Association, a local group of hot rod clubs, but was unauthorized. The Navy and the police looked the other way because Hourglass Field was the only off-street venue available for drag racing at the time. On August 8, 1960, three (possibly four) bystanders were injured during a drag race. The Navy had been under some pressure to crack down on the drag racing and shut down the airfield to drag racing after the incident. Car clubs lobbied the city for an official drag racing site but were denied as the San Diego Police Chief A.E. Jensen said \"Drag strips actually stimulate highway recklessness among those viewing such contests\".\n\nThe Protest was organized by thousands of fliers that were spread around town at coffee shops, car clubs, movie theaters and other places where people would gather. These fliers stated that there would be a \"mass protest meeting\" on El Cajon Boulevard on Sunday August 12. The news was also spread by the a DJ named Dick Boynton on the local radio station. Two days later The police arrested a printer by the name of Herbert Sturdyvin, 20, on suspicion of conspiracy on printing and printing of the fliers that were used to organize the protest. He was released two days later without charges due to the fact that the police did not have enough evidence.\n\nThis led to an organized mass protest the night of August 20 and 21 at the intersection of El Cajon Boulevard and Cherokee Street in San Diego. The crowd of about 3,000 teenagers and adults blocked three blocks of El Cajon Boulevard (one of San Diego's major east-west thoroughfares) and began holding impromptu drag races with just enough room for cars to race two-abreast down the street. Around 2 A.M. more than 65 police officers began quelling the riot first by ordering them to disperse and then moving in with tear gas and riot sticks. Some protestors tried to fight back by throwing coke bottles and rocks at the police and trying to overturn police cars. It took 3 hours to control the mob and two police officers were hurt during the course of the night. At the scene of the riot 80 adult demonstrators and 36 juveniles were arrested for the riot. The next night several Drag racers drove around town taunting the police leading to a further 100 people being arrested including over 30 juveniles who were charged with curfew violations. \n\nAfter the riot the City of San Diego promised to form a committee to look into the problem of a lack of drag racing sites and the president of the national Hot Rod Association also pledged his support to getting local enthusiasts a place to race. Eventually all of these pressures came together and two new Drag racing strips were opened. The San Diego Raceway opened in Ramona in 1963 and the Carlsbad Raceway opened in 1964. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "847651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=847651", "title": "Leg bye", "text": "Leg bye\n\nIn the sport of cricket, a leg bye is a run scored by the batting team if the batsman has not hit the ball with his or her bat, but the ball has hit the batsman's body or protective gear. It is covered by Law 23 of the Laws of Cricket.\n\nIf the ball deflects off the batsman's body he can attempt to score runs in a similar manner as if he had hit the ball. The number of runs scored are scored as leg byes – they are added to the team's total, but not to the number of runs scored by the batsman nor to the runs conceded by the bowler. If the ball deflects off the batsman's body and travels all the way to the boundary, the batting team immediately scores four leg byes, similar to if the ball had been hit to the boundary for a four.\n\nThe only part of the batsman's body to which the rule does not apply is the hand or hands (that is, the batsman's gloves) holding the bat, which are deemed for the sake of the rules to be a part of the bat. If the ball strikes a hand which for whatever reason is not holding the bat, then leg byes may be scored. However, if the batsman deliberately allows the ball to hit a hand which is not holding the bat no leg byes can be scored, and he may on appeal be given out obstructing the field.\n\nLeg byes may only be scored if the ball hits the batsman while the batsman was either:\nIf the batsman was attempting neither of these, and the ball hits his body, it is a dead ball and runs may not be scored. If the batsmen attempt to score runs in this instance, the fielding team may attempt to run either of them out. If the batting pair complete such a \"run\" when the ball is dead, the umpire signals dead ball, the run is not scored, and the batsmen must return to their wickets as before the run attempt. \n\nIf it appears that the ball would have hit the stumps were it not for the batsman's legs, the batsman may be dismissed leg before wicket.\n\nLeg byes are the most common form of extras scored in Test cricket. The average number of leg byes scored in a Test match is about 20; in a 50 over game it is about 10. The most leg byes in a single test innings is 35, conceded by England against South Africa in the Proteas' tour of England, on 1 August 2008.\n\nThe conventional notation for a single leg bye is a triangle with a point at the base and horizontal edge at the top (an inverted bye symbol). If more than one leg bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.\n\nPrior to his retirement from Test cricket Australian captain Steve Waugh called for leg byes to be removed from the sport, commenting: \"I don't think you should get runs when you miss the ball.\"\n\nUmpires signal a leg bye with a hand touching their raised knee.\n"}

Called \"the most storied building in hockey history\" by \"Sporting News\", it was the home of the National Hockey League's Montreal Maroons from 1924 to 1938 and the Montreal Canadiens from 1926 to 1996. The Forum was built by the Canadian Arena Company in 159 days.\n\nLocated at the northeast corner of Atwater and Ste-Catherine West (Metro Atwater), the building was historically significant as it was home to 24 Stanley Cup championships (22 of the Canadiens and two of the Montreal Maroons, for whom the arena was originally built). It was also home to the Montreal Roadrunners and Montreal Junior Canadiens.\n\nThe idea to build the Forum in 1923 is credited to Sir Edward Wentworth Beatty, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway. At the suggestion of Senator Donat Raymond, William Northey developed a plan for a 12,500 seat capacity rink. Plans were scaled back for financial reasons to a rink of 9,300 seats. Even at the reduced size, the rink could not immediately find financing. The Forum would eventually be financed by H. L. Timmins. The site selected was the site of a roller skating rink named the Forum, and the name was kept. The site had previously been the site of an outdoor ice hockey rink, used by Frank and Lester Patrick, Art Ross and Russell Bowie as youths.\n\nThe Forum opened on November 29, 1924, at a total cost of 1,500,000 ($ in dollars) with an original seating capacity of 9,300. It underwent two renovations, in 1949 and 1968. When the Forum closed in 1996 it had a capacity of 17,959, which included approximately 1,600 in standing room.\n\nBy the time of the 1968 renovations, a centre hanging digital scoreclock was installed, designed by the Day Sign Company of Toronto and similar to those installed at the Boston Garden and Chicago Stadium during the 1970s. A new centre hanging scoreclock, designed by Daktronics, was installed in the mid-1980s and contained on each side a color matrix board. Along with one other Original Six indoor ice hockey arena, the Boston Garden, the Montreal Forum used a high-pitched siren to signal the end of an NHL game's period — the siren would later be re-installed in the Forum's successor facility, the Bell Centre (and still in use there), much as the TD Garden in Boston inherited the lower-pitched Garden's siren. A Rainforest Cafe was planned to open at the location following its closure, but was never built.\n\nWhile hosting the Canadiens and Maroons on Thursdays and Saturdays, the Forum also hosted the Quebec Senior Hockey League, featuring the Montreal Victorias, Montreal Royals and the Montreal Canadiens amateur team on Wednesdays and Sundays. The Quebec Junior Hockey League played on Monday nights, the Bank League on Tuesdays and the Railways and Telephone League played on Friday nights.\n\nThe Montreal Forum hosted Memorial Cup games in 1950, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1973 & 1976, with the Junior Canadiens winning on home ice in 1970. In 1972, the Forum hosted game one of the famous \"Summit Series\" between Team Canada and the USSR, the USSR won the game 7-3. The 1980 NHL Entry Draft was hosted at the Forum. It would mark the first time that an NHL Arena hosted the event.\n\nOnly two visiting teams have ever won the Stanley Cup on Forum ice: the New York Rangers did so in 1928, defeating the Maroons, while the Calgary Flames defeated the Canadiens in 1989.\n\nOn March 11, 1996, the Montreal Canadiens played their last game at the Montreal Forum, defeating the Dallas Stars 4-1. The game was televised on TSN and TQS in Canada, and on ESPN2 in the United States. The Stars' Guy Carbonneau, who had captained the Canadiens from 1989 to 1994 (including their 1993 Cup win), took the ceremonial opening faceoff. After the game, many previous hockey greats were presented to the crowd, most notably Maurice Richard (said to be the Canadiens' most beloved player of all time), who received a sixteen-minute standing ovation from the crowd as he broke down in tears. A symbolic torch—representative of a line quoted from the poem \"In Flanders Fields\", \"To you from failing hands we throw the torch; be yours to hold it high,\" displayed in the Forum's home dressing room—was carried by Emile Bouchard out of the Canadiens dressing room to the playing surface. The flaming torch was passed on to each of the former Canadiens captains (Jean Beliveau, Yvan Cournoyer, Henri Richard, Serge Savard, Bob Gainey, and Carbonneau), and finally to the then-current captain Pierre Turgeon. The next day, a parade was organized in which the torch was carried down the route to the Molson Centre (which has since been renamed the Bell Centre). Their first game at the new venue was against the New York Rangers, a game which the Canadiens won.\n\nThe Forum also hosted other sports, including indoor soccer, boxing, lacrosse and tennis. The Forum was a site of five events in the 1976 Summer Olympics: gymnastics, handball (final), basketball (final), volleyball (final), and boxing (final). The gymnastics event included Nadia Comaneci's famous perfect 10, the first in Olympic history.\n\nThe Forum was the site of many major professional wrestling matches, as shown in the 1961 National Film Board of Canada documentary \"Wrestling\" (\"La Lutte\").\n\nOn March 11, 1937, the Forum hosted its only funeral, for Canadiens great Howie Morenz. Morenz died from complications due to a broken leg, sustained in a game between the Canadiens and the Chicago Blackhawks on January 28. On September 8, 1964, The Beatles performed at the Forum. Four tracks including a live version of \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" for \"\" were recorded here. The Bee Gees played two sold-out concerts here on September 1–2, 1979 during their North American Spirits Having Flown Tour. The first four tracks off the Journey live album \"Captured\" were recorded at The Forum on August 8, 1980. In 1981, Canadian rock band Rush filmed (and recorded almost all of) their 1981 concert film and album, \"Exit...Stage Left\". That same year, British rock band Queen recorded and filmed their concert film, titled \"We Will Rock You\" (re-released as \"Queen Rock Montreal\" in 2007), by performing the final two concerts of The Game Tour there. This had followed earlier performances by the band in 1977 for the A Day At The Races Tour, 1978 for the Jazz Tour, 1980 for the first leg of The Game Tour, and finally in 1982 for the Hot Space Tour. In March 1983, American musical duo Hall & Oates filmed and recorded their concert film, Rock 'n Soul Live. The live portions of Black Sabbath's video for the song \"Zero the Hero\" were filmed in 1983. July 7–8 Madonna with her Who's That Girl World Tour for two sold-out concerts. In July 1993, David Bowie held a concert for his Serious Moonlight Tour to promote his new album \"Let's Dance\". Billy Graham held his Mission Quebec in 1990, before nearly 20,000 spectators, which was videotaped for international television syndication as a TV special. Then Canadien Ryan Walter delivered his testimony at the crusade.\n\nThe seating capacity for hockey went as followed:\n\nAfter the Canadiens left the Forum, the building was used to film arena sequences for the Brian De Palma film \"Snake Eyes\". It was then completely gutted and converted into a downtown entertainment centre called the Pepsi Forum, consisting of an AMC Theatres multiplex theatre (sold to Cineplex Odeon in July 2012), shops and restaurants. Centre ice has been recreated in the centre of the complex complete with a small section of the grandstand, along with a statue of a fan leaning forward in delight (removed in the summer of 2017), while original seats are used as benches throughout the complex. A statue of Maurice Richard can be found next to the grandstand. On the Saint Catherine Street entrance there is a Quebec Walk of Fame consisting of Richard and Celine Dion. Both were on hand for their bronze star's respective unveiling. The Atwater street entrance has a large bronze Montreal Canadiens logo surrounded by 24 bronze Stanley Cup banners cemented into the sidewalk. Inscribed in French are the words \"forever proud\". The entire building is themed after the Forum's storied history with special emphasis on the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nThe building was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997 because: \n\nThe city of Montreal estimates the value of the building at $36.8M, in 2012. This is a $10M drop in value since the previous estimation in 2009. AMC Forum is now owned by New York City-based real estate investor Ben Ashkenazy through a firm called Investissements Forum Canadien Inc.\n\n"}

Catches are most likely to arise from shots that have been 'skied' (in cricket) or 'popped \n' (in baseball). If a catch is not possible (for example, the ball has bounced, or is rolling or skidding across the turf) the fielder will attempt to head off, pick up and throw in the ball as quickly as possible to reduce the distance the runners can run and hopefully to effect a run out (cricket) or tag out (baseball).\n\nIn cricket, where the ball is far more likely to stay low against the ground than in baseball, the condition of the turf has a major effect on the speed at which the ball travels through the outfield. On a slow outfield the ball decelerates significantly, making fielding easier and batting harder — in particular boundaries are far harder to hit. This usually occurs if the playing surface is uneven or if it is damp from rain or dew. However, on a fast outfield the ball does not decelerate significantly even when rolling along the turf, often racing past the fielders and over the boundary rope. In these circumstances, batsmen find it easier to score runs quickly. Commentators often refer to the ball accelerating to the boundary on fast outfields, but this only physically occurs on grounds with a slope and on which the ball is moving downhill.\n\nIn baseball, a slow, damp outfield is usually considered an advantage for the hitter, in as much as a batted ball will not travel as quickly to an outfielder in the traditional deep position for fly balls, and thus may permit additional advance by batters and other runners on the basepaths. In addition, a wet, slick ball can not be thrown with the accuracy of a dry one, also permitting the opportunity for additional advance on the bases. Moreover, a wet field generally slows the footspeed of the defense, so fielders will be able to reach fewer flies and line drives in the air before they go through to the fences.\n\nIn association football, eleven players are fielded in each match. The goalkeeper remains in the goal, and the remaining ten players are \"outfield\" players.\n\n\n"}

The official will hold the card above his or her head while looking or pointing towards the player that has committed the offence. This action makes the decision clear to all players, as well as spectators and other officials in a manner that is language-neutral. The colour or shape of the card used by the official indicates the type or seriousness of the offence and the level of punishment that is to be applied. Yellow and red cards are the most common, typically indicating, respectively, cautions and dismissals.\n\nThe idea of using language-neutral coloured cards to communicate a referee's intentions originated in association football, with English referee Ken Aston. Aston had been appointed to the FIFA Referees' Committee and was responsible for all referees at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. In the quarter-finals, England met Argentina at the Wembley Stadium. After the match, newspaper reports stated that referee Rudolf Kreitlein had cautioned Englishmen Bobby and Jack Charlton, as well as sending off Argentinian Antonio Rattín. The referee had not made his decision clear during the game, and England manager Alf Ramsey approached FIFA representative for post-match clarification. This incident started Aston thinking about ways to make a referee's decisions clearer to both players and spectators. Aston realised that a colour-coding scheme based on the same principle as used on traffic lights (yellow – stop if safe to do so, red – stop) would transcend language barriers and make it clear that a player had been cautioned or expelled. As a result, yellow cards to indicate a caution and red cards to indicate an expulsion were used for the first time in the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. The use of penalty cards has since been adopted and expanded by several sporting codes, with each sport adapting the idea to its specific set of rules or laws.\n\nA yellow card is used in many different sporting codes. Its meaning differs among sports; however, it most commonly indicates a caution given to a player regarding his or her conduct, or indicates a temporary suspension. Examples include:\n\nA red card is used in several different sporting codes. Its meaning differs among sports, but it most commonly indicates a serious offence and often results in a player being permanently suspended from the game (commonly known as an ejection, dismissal, expulsion, removal, or sending-off, often with personal embarrassment). In many sports the ejected player's team cannot replace them and thus must continue the rest of the game with one fewer player, which may be a significant disadvantage. Examples include:\n\n\nA green card is used in some sports to indicate an official warning to a player who has committed a minor offence that does not warrant a more serious sanction.\n\nA white card is used in bandy to indicate a five-minute timed penalty given to a player. The offending player must leave the playing area and wait on a penalty bench near the centre line until the penalty has expired. During the 5 minute period the player may not be replaced, although he or she may be replaced with a different player when the penalty has expired. Offences that can warrant a white card include trying to hinder the opponents from executing a free-stroke, illegal substitution or repeated illegal but non-violent attacks on an opponent.\n\nIn the 2012 Super Rugby season in rugby union, a White Card was introduced for incidents of suspected foul play where the referee is unsure of the identity of the perpetrator, or where the referee is unsure if a red card is warranted. The incident is later referred to the citing commissioner, and may result in a suspension for the offending player. It is similar to a citation sign (arms crossed above the head) in rugby league. However, in 2013 the International Rugby Board, now known as World Rugby, extended the powers of the TMO to include reviewing suspected incidents of foul play. As a result, no white cards were issued in 2013.\n\nA blue card or 'Blue Disk' as pioneered by The Elms, is used in bandy to indicate a ten-minute timed penalty given to a player. The offending player must leave the playing area and wait on a penalty bench near the centre line until the penalty has expired. During the 10 minute period the player may not be replaced, although he or she may be replaced with a different player when the penalty has expired. A blue card is typically shown for offences that are more serious than those warranting a white card including attacking an opponent in a violent or dangerous way, causing advantage by intentionally stopping the ball with a high stick or protesting a referee's decision.\n\nA blue card is also frequently used in indoor soccer in the United States, signifying that the offender must leave the field and stay in a penalty box (usually 2–5 minutes), during which time their team plays down a man (identical to ice hockey and roller hockey). If a goal is scored by the team opposite of the offender, then the offender may return to the field immediately. It is also used in the Clericus Cup association football league for a 5-minute bench penalty for unsportsmanlike play. And it is also used in the beach soccer for a 2-minute bench penalty for unsportsmanlike play.\n\nA Blue Card is also used in quidditch to indicate a technical foul. The fouling player is sent to the penalty box for one minute or until a goal is scored against the fouling player's team. Unlike a yellow card, there is no additional penalty for multiple blue cards.\n\nIn European indoor soccer or Futsal, a Blue Card was used to send a player off the court; however the team was able to replace him with another player. The offending player could not return to play during the match. A blue card was shown directly for foul play or verbal abuse, if the same player had received two yellow cards, or if he had accumulated a total of 5 fouls during the game.\n\nThe Blue Card has been in use in Handball since the International Handball Federation announced a rule change that came into effect on July 1, 2016. First the Red Card is shown, then the referee will after a short discussion show the blue card. Following that a written report will accompany the score sheet and the Disciplinary Commission will then decide on further actions against the player.\n\nA black card is used in fencing. It is issued by the director, or the referee for severe rule infractions. A second instance of a Group 3 offence, and all Group 4 offences including deliberate brutality, refusal to fence, refusal to salute, and refusal to shake hands can be punished with a black card. When the black card is issued, the offending fencer is excluded from the remainder of the competition and may be suspended from further tournaments. In the official record of the tournament, his or her name is replaced with the words \"FENCER EXCLUDED\".\n\nA black card is also used in the sport of badminton to indicate disqualification.\n\nIn the Gaelic Games of Gaelic football and hurling, a \"tick\" or \"black book\" – was formerly recorded against a player for a minor infringement not warranting a yellow card, though multiple bookings will result in the issuance of a yellow card. The act of the referee physically holding up his black notebook in the same manner as a card has been discontinued by the GAA.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2014 a player in Gaelic football can be ordered off the pitch for the remainder of the game with a substitution allowed by being physically shown a Black Card (the referee's black notebook) in the same manner as any other penalty card for \"cynical behaviour,\" including blatant tripping, pulling down and bodychecking. This forced substitution is an intermediate punishment between the yellow and red cards. A player who receives a yellow card and a black card in the same game is sent off without any substitute being permitted.\n\n"}

{"id": "45772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45772", "title": "Rocky", "text": "Rocky\n\nRocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen and both written by and starring Sylvester Stallone. It tells the rags to riches American Dream story of Rocky Balboa, an uneducated but kind-hearted working class Italian-American boxer working as a debt collector for a loan shark in the slums of Philadelphia. Rocky, a small-time club fighter, gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship. The film also stars Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Adrian's brother Paulie, Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer Mickey Goldmill, and Carl Weathers as the champion, Apollo Creed.\n\nThe film, made on a budget of just over $1 million, was a sleeper hit; it earned $225 million in global box office receipts, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1976, and went on to win three Oscars, including Best Picture. The film received many positive reviews and turned Stallone into a major star. In 2006, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". \"Rocky\" is considered to be one of the greatest sports films ever made and was ranked as the second-best in the genre, after \"Raging Bull\", by the American Film Institute in 2008.\n\nThe film has spawned seven sequels: \"Rocky II\" (1979), \"Rocky III\" (1982), \"Rocky IV\" (1985), \"Rocky V\" (1990), \"Rocky Balboa\" (2006), \"Creed\" (2015) and Creed II (2018). Stallone portrays Rocky in all seven sequels, wrote the first five, and directed four (Avildsen returned to direct \"Rocky V\" and Ryan Coogler directed \"Creed\"). An eighth film and direct sequel to \"Creed\", titled \"Creed II\", was released in 2018 with Steven Caple Jr. directing and Stallone returning to star and writing the script.\n\nIn late 1975, the heavyweight boxing world champion, Apollo Creed, announces plans to hold a title bout in Philadelphia during the upcoming United States Bicentennial. However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand. With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him. He settles in on Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa, an aspiring southpaw boxer from an Italian neighborhood of Philadelphia, known by the nickname \"The Italian Stallion\".\n\nRocky meets with promoter Miles Jergens, unexpectedly presuming Creed is seeking local sparring partners. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $150,000. After several weeks of training, using whatever he can find, including meat carcasses as punching bags, Rocky accepts an offer of assistance from former boxer Mickey \"Mighty Mick\" Goldmill, a respected trainer and former bantamweight fighter from the 1920s, who always criticized Rocky for wasting his potential.\n\nMeanwhile, Rocky meets Adrian Pennino, who is working part-time at the J&M Tropical Fish pet store. He begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian, culminating in a kiss. Adrian's brother, Paulie, becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky calms him by agreeing to advertise his meatpacking business before the upcoming fight. The night before the fight, Rocky begins to lose confidence after touring the arena. He confesses to Adrian that he does not expect to win, but is content to go the distance against Creed and prove himself to everyone.\n\nOn New Year's Day, the fight is held, with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as George Washington and then Uncle Sam. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round—the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humiliated, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries, Rocky with a detached retina in his right eye and hits to the head, and Apollo with internal bleeding and a broken rib. As the fight progresses, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch.\n\nAfter the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was \"the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring\", and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the result of the fight.\n\nSylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for \"Rocky\" in three and a half days, shortly after watching the championship match between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner that took place at Richfield Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio on March 24, 1975. Wepner was TKO'd in the 15th round of the match by Ali, with few expecting him to last as long as he did. Despite the fact that the match motivated Stallone to begin work on \"Rocky\", he has subsequently denied that Wepner provided any inspiration for the script. Other possible inspirations for the film may have included characteristics of real-life boxers Rocky Marciano and Joe Frazier, as well as Rocky Graziano's autobiography \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" and the movie of the same name. Wepner filed a lawsuit which was eventually settled with Stallone for an undisclosed amount.\n\nUnited Artists liked Stallone's script, and viewed it as a possible vehicle for a well-established star such as Robert Redford, Ryan O'Neal, Burt Reynolds, or James Caan. Stallone insisted upon portraying the title character himself, to the point of issuing an ultimatum. Stallone later said that he would never have forgiven himself, had the film become a success with somebody else in the lead. He also knew that producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff's contract with the studio enabled them to \"greenlight\" a project if the budget was kept low enough. The producers also collateralized any possible losses with their big-budget entry, \"New York, New York\" (whose eventual losses were covered by \"Rocky\" success). The film's production budget ended up being $1,075,000, with a further $100,000 spent on producers' fees and $4.2 million on advertising costs.\n\nAlthough Chartoff and Winkler were enthusiastic about the script and the idea of Stallone playing the lead character, they were hesitant about having an unknown headline the film. The producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story, with Apollo Creed and Adrian cast unusually late by production standards (both were ultimately cast on the same day). Real-life boxer Ken Norton was initially sought for the role of Apollo Creed, but he pulled out and the role was ultimately given to Carl Weathers. Norton had had three fights with Muhammad Ali, upon whom Creed was loosely based. According to \"The Rocky Scrapbook\", Carrie Snodgress was originally chosen to play Adrian, but a money dispute forced the producers to look elsewhere. Susan Sarandon auditioned for the role but was deemed too pretty for the character. After Talia Shire's ensuing audition, Chartoff and Winkler, along with Avildsen, insisted that she play the part.\n\nBoxer Joe Frazier has a cameo appearance in the film. The character of Apollo Creed was influenced by outspoken boxer Muhammad Ali who fought Frazier three times. During the 49th Academy Awards ceremony in 1977, Ali and Stallone staged a brief comic confrontation to show Ali was not offended by the film. Some of the plot's most memorable moments—Rocky's carcass-punching scenes and Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, as part of his training regimen—are taken from the real-life exploits of Joe Frazier, for which he received no credit.\n\nDue to the film's comparatively low budget, members of Stallone's family played minor roles. His father rings the bell to signal the start and end of a round, his brother Frank plays a street corner singer, and his first wife, Sasha, was stills photographer. Other cameos include former Philadelphia and then-current Los Angeles television sportscaster Stu Nahan playing himself, alongside radio and TV broadcaster Bill Baldwin; and Lloyd Kaufman, founder of the independent film company Troma, appearing as a drunk. Diana Lewis, then a news anchor in Los Angeles and later in Detroit, has a small scene as a TV news reporter. Tony Burton appeared as Apollo Creed's trainer, Tony \"Duke\" Evers, a role he would reprise in the entire \"Rocky\" series, though he is not given an official name until \"Rocky II\". Though uncredited, Michael Dorn, who would later gain fame as the Klingon Worf in \"\" and \"\", made his acting debut as Creed's bodyguard.\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Rocky\" began on January 9, 1976. Filming took place primarily throughout Philadelphia, with a few scenes being shot in Los Angeles. Inventor/operator Garrett Brown's new Steadicam was used to accomplish smooth photography while running alongside Rocky during the film's Philadelphia street jogging/training sequences and the run up the Art Museum's flight of stairs, now colloquially known as the Rocky Steps. It was also used for some of the shots in the fight scenes and can be seen at the ringside during some wide shots of the final fight. \"Rocky\" is often erroneously cited as the first film to use the Steadicam, although it was actually the third, after \"Bound for Glory\" and \"Marathon Man\".\n\nCertain elements of the story were altered during filming. The original script had a darker tone: Mickey was portrayed as racist, and the script ended with Rocky throwing the fight after realizing he did not want to be part of the professional boxing world after all.\n\nDuring filming, both Stallone and Weathers suffered injuries during the shooting of the final fight; Stallone suffered bruised ribs and Weathers suffered a damaged nose, the opposite injuries of what their characters had.\n\nThe first date between Rocky and Adrian, in which Rocky bribes a janitor to allow them to skate after closing hours in a deserted ice skating rink, was shot that way only because of budgetary pressures. This scene was originally scheduled to be shot in a skating rink during regular business hours. However, the producers decided that they could not afford to hire the hundreds of extras that would have been necessary for that scene.\n\nThe poster seen above the ring before Rocky fights Apollo Creed shows Rocky wearing red shorts with a white stripe when he actually wears white shorts with a red stripe. When Rocky points this out, he is told that \"it doesn't really matter, does it?\" According to director Avildsen's DVD commentary, this was an actual mistake made by the props department that they could not afford to rectify, so Stallone wrote the brief scene to ensure the audience did not see it as a goof. (Carl Weathers, coincidentally, wore white-striped red shorts for the Creed-Balboa rematch in \"Rocky II\".) Avildsen said that the same situation arose with Rocky's robe. When it came back from the costume department, it was far too baggy for Stallone. Because the robe arrived on the day of filming the scene and there was no chance of replacing or altering it, instead of ignoring this and risking the audience laughing at it, Stallone wrote the dialogue where Rocky himself points out the robe is too big.\n\nThe musical score for \"Rocky\" was composed by Bill Conti, who previously composed a score for director John G. Avildsen's \"W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings\" (1975) that was ultimately rejected by the studio. In fact, David Shire (then-husband of Talia Shire) was the first to be offered the chance to compose the music for \"Rocky\" but had to turn it down due to prior commitments. Thus, Avildsen reached out to Conti without any studio intervention due to the film's relatively low budget. \"The budget for the music was 25 grand,\" said Avildsen. \"And that was for everything: The composer's fee, that was to pay the musicians, that was to rent the studio, that was to buy the tape that it was going to be recorded on.\"\n\nThe main theme song, \"Gonna Fly Now\", made it to number one on the \"Billboard\" magazine's Hot 100 list for one week (from July 2 to July 8, 1977) and the American Film Institute placed it 58th on its AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs. A soundtrack album was released on November 12, 1976 by United Artists Records. The album was re-released in 1988 by EMI on CD and cassette.\n\n\"Rocky\" grossed $5 million during its opening weekend and consistently performed well for 8 months and eventually reached $117 million at the North American box office. Adjusted for inflation, the film earned over $500 million in North America at 2018 prices. Overseas \"Rocky\" fared just as well, grossing $107 million for a worldwide box office accumulation of $225 million. With its production budget of $1 million, \"Rocky\" is notable for its worldwide percentage return of over 11,000 percent. It was the highest-grossing film released in 1976 in the United States and Canada and the second highest-grossing film of 1977.\n\n\"Rocky\" received positive reviews at the time of its release. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said that Stallone reminded him of \"the young Marlon Brando.\" \"Box Office Magazine\" claimed that audiences would be \"touting Sylvester 'Sly' Stallone as a new star\". Frank Rich liked the film, calling it \"almost 100 per cent schmaltz,\" but favoring it over the cynicism that was prevalent in movies at that time, although he referred to the plot as \"gimmicky\" and the script \"heavy-handed\". Several reviews, including Richard Eder's (as well as Canby's negative review), compared the work to that of Frank Capra.\n\nThe film, however, did not escape criticism. Vincent Canby, of \"The New York Times\", called it \"pure '30s make believe\" and dismissed both Stallone's acting and Avildsen's directing, calling the latter \"none too decisive\". Andrew Sarris found the Capra comparisons disingenuous: \"Capra's movies projected more despair deep down than a movie like \"Rocky\" could envisage, and most previous ring movies have been much more cynical about the fight scene,\" and, commenting on Rocky's work as a loan shark, says that the film \"teeters on the edge of sentimentalizing gangsters.\" Sarris also found Meredith \"oddly cast in the kind of part the late James Gleason used to pick his teeth.\"\n\nFour decades later, the film enjoys a reputation as a classic and still receives nearly universal praise; \"Rocky\" holds a 93% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site's consensus states: \"This story of a down-on-his-luck boxer is thoroughly predictable, but Sylvester Stallone's script and stunning performance in the title role brush aside complaints.\" One of the positive online reviews came from the BBC Films website, with both reviewer Almar Haflidason and BBC online users giving it 5/5 stars. In Steven J. Schneider's \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\", Schneider says the film is \"often overlooked as schmaltz.\"\n\nIn 2006, \"Rocky\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\"Rocky\" received ten Oscar nominations in nine categories at the 49th Academy Awards, winning three:\n\nThe Directors Guild of America awarded \"Rocky\" its annual award for best film of the year in 1976, and in 2006, Sylvester Stallone's original screenplay for \"Rocky\" was selected for the Writers Guild of America Award as the 78th best screenplay of all time.\n\nIn June 2008, AFI revealed its \"Ten top Ten\"—the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. \"Rocky\" was acknowledged as the second-best film in the sports genre, after \"Raging Bull\".\n\nIn 2008, \"Rocky\" was chosen by British film magazine \"Empire\" as one of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". In contrast, in a 2005 poll by \"Empire\", Rocky was No. 9 on their list of \"The Top 10 Worst Pictures to Win Best Picture Oscar\".\n\n\"Rocky\" has also appeared on several of the American Film Institute's \"100 Years\" lists.\n\nThe famous scene of Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art has become a cultural icon, with the steps acquiring the vernacular title of \"Rocky Steps\". In 1982, a statue of Rocky, commissioned by Stallone for \"Rocky III\", was placed at the top of the Rocky Steps. City Commerce Director Dick Doran claimed that Stallone and Rocky had done more for the city's image than \"anyone since Ben Franklin.\"\n\nDiffering opinions of the statue and its placement led to a relocation to the sidewalk outside the Spectrum Arena, although the statue was temporarily returned to the top of the steps in 1990 for \"Rocky V\", and again in 2006 for the 30th anniversary of the original \"Rocky\" (although this time it was placed at the bottom of the steps). Later that year, it was permanently moved to a spot next to the steps.\n\nThe scene is frequently parodied in the media. In the 2008 movie \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\", Zohan's nemesis, Phantom, goes through a parodied training sequence finishing with him running up a desert dune and raising his hands in victory. In the fourth-season finale of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", as the credits roll at the end of the episode, Will is seen running up the same steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art; however, as he celebrates after finishing his climb, he passes out in exhaustion, and while he lies unconscious on the ground, a pickpocket steals his wallet and his wool hat. In \"The Nutty Professor\", there is a scene where Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) struggles to and eventually succeeds at running up a lengthy flight of steps on his college campus, victoriously throwing punches at the top.\n\nIn 2006, E! named the \"Rocky Steps\" scene #13 in its \"101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment\".\n\nDuring the 1996 Summer Olympics torch relay, Philadelphia native Dawn Staley was chosen to run up the museum steps. In 2004, Presidential candidate John Kerry ended his pre-convention campaign at the foot of the steps before going to Boston to accept his party's nomination for President.\n\n\nUpon the film's release, a paperback novelization of the screenplay was written by Rosalyn Drexler under the pseudonym Julia Sorel and published by Ballantine Books in 1976. Several video games have also been made based on the film. The first \"Rocky\" video game was released by Coleco for ColecoVision in August 1983 titled \"Rocky Super Action Boxing\"; the principal designer was Coleco staffer B. Dennis Sustare. Another was released in 1987 for the Sega Master System. In 1985, Dinamic Software released a boxing game for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum (also advertised for and/or published on the Sega Master System, Amstrad CPC and MSX) called \"Rocky\". Due to copyright reasons it was quickly renamed \"Rocco\". Rocky-themed merchandise is commonplace in Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1988, William T. Naud released a low budget parody entitled \"Ricky 1\".\n\nMore recently, a \"Rocky\" video game was released in 2002 for the Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, and a sequel, \"Rocky Legends\", was released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. In 2007, a video game called \"Rocky Balboa\" was released for PSP. In 2016, Tapinator, Inc. released a mobile game named \"ROCKY\" for the iOS platform, with a planned 2017 release for Google Play and Amazon platforms.\n\nA musical was written by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (lyrics and music), with the book by Thomas Meehan, based on the film. The musical premiered in Hamburg, Germany in October 2012. It began performances at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway on February 11, 2014, and officially opened on March 13, 2014.\n\nThe 2016 film \"Chuck\" depicts Chuck Wepner, his 1975 title fight with the heavyweight champion, Muhammad Ali, and the fight's influence on the screenplay for \"Rocky\".\n\n\"Rocky\" is featured in the 2017 documentary \"John G. Avildsen: King of the Underdogs\" about Academy Award-winning \"Rocky\" director John G. Avildsen, directed and produced by Derek Wayne Johnson.\n\nSylvester Stallone hand-picked Derek Wayne Johnson to direct and produce a documentary on the making of the original \"Rocky\", currently entitled \"40 Years of Rocky: The Birth of a Classic\", due for release in 2019. The documentary will feature Sylvester Stallone narrating behind-the-scenes footage from the making of the film.\n\n"}
