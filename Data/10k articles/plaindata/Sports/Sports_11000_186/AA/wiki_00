The stadium was home to Stirling Albion F.C. until 1993 when it closed after Stirling Albion moved to Forthbank Stadium.\n\nBefore World War II, King's Park was the Scottish Football League club based in Stirling, but their Forthbank Park ground was destroyed by the Luftwaffe during the war. Rather than resurrect King's Park, a group of local businessmen led by coal merchant Tom Fergusson, decided to purchase the Annfield Estate. They formed new club called Stirling Albion. Oak trees were cleared from the estate to lay a pitch and Albion trucks were used as viewing platforms until a stand was built. Annfield opened on 1 August 1945 and the first game played at Annfield was Stirling Albion's tie with Edinburgh City on 18 August 1945, Stirling Albion won the game 8–3.\n\nThe club constructed a main east stand in 1946 and rebuilt three years later, while a west stand was built in the early 1950s. The record attendance of 26,400 was set by a 1958–59 Scottish Cup tie against Celtic. Soon after this, the club erected a roof over the northern terracing. It installed floodlights in 1961 and inaugurated with a friendly match against Birmingham City in November. During this period, the Annfield House provided the dressing rooms and club offices. In 1974, these functions moved to a new block erected behind the east stand.\n\nStirling Albion sold Annfield to Stirling Council in 1981 when it was on the verge bankruptcy. The club's only choice to avoid insolvency was selling the ground for £250,000 to the council and then renting it for £3,000 per annum. In April 1984, the council conducted a safety assessment that resulted in condemnation of parts of the east stand. Stirling Council decided that it would only invest further public funds in Annfield if it were more accessible to the community. This resulted in the installation of a synthetic pitch, which the Scottish Football League approved in 1987. The first match in Scottish football history played on a synthetic surface was at Annfield in September 1987, between Stirling Albion and Ayr United.\n\nThe Stirling Council spent significant funds on Annfield during the 1980s; £100,000 for new floodlights, barriers and gates in 1986 and £450,000 on the synthetic pitch. The cost of the pitch was relatively high because the sloped surface required leveling. The stadium added 600 plastic seats in the west stand in 1987, but the east stand was largely demolished resulting in a capacity of 14,000.\n\nStirling Council decided in the early 1990s that Annfield should be replaced as the cost of upgrading the buildings and the pitch was not economical. The council constructed Forthbank Stadium and closed Annfield on 31 May 1993, at the end of the 1992–93 season an after 48 years of use. It demolished the facility to make way for a new housing development.\n\n\n"}

Chain-link fence is not required but can be useful to enclose the netting to prevent vandalism. However, this material is not suitable for the primary impact layer because it will warp the fencing and damage balls. The ideal netting for a batting cage is either diamond- or square-shaped. Both types of netting have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nA batter stands at one end of the cage, with a pitching machine (or, less often, a human pitcher) at the opposing end. The pitcher or pitching machine pitches baseballs to the batter, who hits them. It is recommended to use a protective pitcher's L-screen to prevent batted balls from striking the pitcher or machine.\n\nThe cage is used to keep the loose baseballs within a certain range so that they're easy to pick up and are not lost. Batting cages are found both indoors and outdoors.\n\nThe interior floor of a batting cage may be sloped, to automatically feed the baseballs back into the automatic pitching machine. The automatic pitching machines using sloped floors usually pitch out a synthetic baseball or softball, rather than an official solid core leather hardball.\n\nCommercial batting cages pitch with several different speeds, which can range from (for softball) to per hour.\n\nCricket nets and tunnels, used by cricket batsmen are similar in purpose, but bowling machines are much less common than facing a live bowler (this reflects the fact that nearly half of the members of a cricket team are specialist bowlers, and therefore proportionately more bowling practice is needed in cricket than pitching practice in baseball).\n\nNetting can greatly vary in quality and durability. #21 Gauge is suitable for little-league players, #36 Gauge is suitable for High-School players, and #60 is recommended for Commercial facilities and Pro Players. Resources such as this Netting Infographic Guide are helpful for identifying the best netting for an application.\n\nIndoor batting cages are typically suspended by steel cable lines, 1 line every 6–8 feet. The anchor points being the most important component, typically connected using a steel plate to the wall. Without strong anchors, the netting will sag.\n\nOutdoor batting cages are typically installed using steel pole sections (2 uprights and 1 cross-bar per section), spaced every 12–20 feet. The greater the span between supports, the more sag in the netting and less usable the cage becomes.\n"}

{"id": "5031880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5031880", "title": "Boothferry Park", "text": "Boothferry Park\n\nBoothferry Park was a football stadium in Hull, England, which was home to Hull City A.F.C. from 1946 until 2002, when they moved to the Kingston Communications Stadium.\n\nIn later years, financial constraints forced Hull City to allow Kwik Save and Iceland supermarkets to embed themselves into the stadium's structure. Parts of the ground were demolished in early 2008, more than five years after the last game was played there, and the remainder in 2011.\n\nThe ground was originally planned in 1929, and work began on the site from 1932 based near the Humber Estuary. Financial difficulties severely hampered this development, with the playing area and part of the terracing appearing over the following 12 months before work and progress ground to a halt. A proposal in 1939 for a sports stadium on the site was the catalyst for further development, as even though this threw up doubt for the original stadium plans, no suitable financial offer for the land was forthcoming, and instead the Hull City board enquired after, and were granted, a Football Association loan to the sum of £6,600. This meant the new ground would be ready for the opening of the 1941 season.\n\nThe onset of the Second World War was to again frustrate the development of the football ground, as during the war, the ground was used by the Home Guard, and was, for a period, used to repair tanks. This, not unexpectedly, had an adverse effect on the playing area – following the end of the war, the pitch was in very poor shape and prone to waterlogging.\n\nBuilding materials were hard to come by in the post-war years for something as \"frivolous\" as a football stadium in the heavily bombed city, this and the state of the pitch meant that the ground was still not in a usable state by the 1945–46 season, so the club was forced to return to playing its matches at one of its former homes, the Boulevard, the then home of Hull rugby league club, one of the city's two rugby league clubs.\n\nThe ground was opened in August 1946, 17 years after its initial proposal, but only had planning permission for one stand along the west side with an upper cost limit of £17,000. The ground was still not fully completed and it became a race against time to make the stadium ready for its opening match against visiting Lincoln City. Twenty-thousand people gathered to watch the opening ceremony performed by the city's lord mayor. The teams were led onto the pitch by Sergeant JT \"Tommy\" Brooke riding a white horse. Sergeant Brooke was a detective and mounted officer in the Hull Police and was a veteran of the First World War and the Battle of the Somme where he was a machine gunner with the Royal Horse Guards.\n\nBy 1948 the attendance record had swelled to 40,179 as the stadium hosted visitors Middlesbrough in the FA Cup. The terracing embankments were raised and by February 1949 a ground and club record which still stands was hit – 55,019 turned out to watch Hull City play Manchester United. The locally famous Boothferry Halt opened in 1951. The ground now had its own railway station, its first use being a fixture against Everton when six trains ran the football service between Paragon Station, Hull's central railway station and Boothferry Park. At the same time, work proceeded on the covering of the North Stand.\n\nThe East Terrace was the next to be covered, albeit with a temporary structure. This temporary structure was never replaced, and stood throughout the years of the ground. The popular East Terrace became known as the Kempton Stand after Kempton Road on the other side of the railway station. With the three stands completed, the ground was now suited to a floodlight installation. Two gantries housing 96 lamps were built, one on the west and one opposite on the east following a licence being granted. Although this lighting system was the envy of many clubs, advancements in stadium lighting came rapidly, and the system soon needed replacement. A six pylon system replaced the old gantries in 1963.\nThe new lights were used for the first time in 1964, using four of the six available, in an evening match against Barnsley which ended in a 7–0 win for the Tigers.\n\nIn 1965 a new South Stand was built over the Bunker's Hill Terrace. The new two-tiered structure included a propped cantilever roof, 2,500 seats in the upper tier and terracing for 4,000 more in the lower tier. The new stand was arguably the best stand at Boothferry Park, and a reminder of the golden days in the declining years to come.\nOn 20 March 1967, Boothferry Park hosted an FA Cup 2nd replay between Leeds United and Sunderland. Over 40,000 fans attended and Leeds United won 2–1. It was standard procedure in the pre penalty shoot-out days for 2nd and subsequent replays to be held on neutral grounds.\n\nOn 16 February 1972 Boothferry Park hosted a full international match between Northern Ireland and Spain. The result was drawn at 1–1.\n\nThe final football match to be staged at Boothferry Park saw Hull City lose 0–1 to Darlington in December 2002. The goal was scored by Simon Betts; it would be his only goal in Darlington colours. Darlington goalkeeper Michael Ingham played in both the final match at Boothferry Park and the first match to be played at Hull City's new home (in Sunderland colours).\n\nBoothferry Park was also the scene of a rugby league international when it hosted the first Ashes series test of the 1982 Kangaroo tour between Great Britain and Australia on 30 October. The Aussies ran in eight tries to nil in a 40–4 thrashing watched by a vocal crowd of 26,771.\n\nBoothferry Park hosted nine top grade rugby league matches, including five internationals, from 1980–1985.\nOther than the five internationals, Boothferry Park also hosted a further five top grade rugby league games.\n\nDemolition of the ground eventually started on 10 January 2008, over five years after the final game was played there, and was completed during March. The North Stand and the terracing on the South and East Stands were eventually demolished in January 2010 after years of vandalism and arson attacks. Humberside Fire and Rescue Service had to be called out nearly 100 times during 2009 to deal with the situation.\nThe six floodlights that had dominated the West Hull skyline were finally dismantled in early 2011.\n\nThe highest attendance before the new stand was built was 40,179 in 1948 when Hull City played Middlesbrough in the FA Cup. In 1949 55,019 witnessed the visit of Manchester United when the height of the terracing was increased. The biggest Scoring Game came in a friendly Match in 1950. When Hull City played Nuneaton Borough the score ended 8-6 to Hull City with the score having been 0-1 to Nuneaton Borough at halftime.\n\nThe stadium became affectionately known by supporters as \"Fer Ark\" in its later days, due to the lack of finances for maintenance which meant that only those letters were illuminated on the large \"boothFERry pARK\" signage. Before this it had been known as \"Bothferry Park\" when one of the illuminated \"O\"s fell off.\nIt was also known simply as \"BP\".\n\n"}

In popular culture, clubs are associated with primitive cultures, especially cavemen.\n\nMost clubs are small enough to be swung with one hand, although larger clubs may require the use of two to be effective. Various specialized clubs are used in martial arts and other fields, including the law-enforcement baton. The military mace is a more sophisticated descendant of the club, typically made of metal and featuring a spiked, knobbed, or flanged head attached to a shaft.\n\nThe wounds inflicted by a club are generally known as \"bludgeoning\" or \"blunt-force trauma\" injuries.\n\nPolice forces and their predecessors have traditionally favored the use, whenever possible, of less-lethal weapons than guns or blades. Until recent times, when alternatives such as tasers and capsicum spray became available, this category of policing weapon has generally been filled by some form of wooden club variously termed a truncheon, baton, nightstick, or lathi.

West Kent (or West of Kent) teams have been recorded from 1705 but there is no known record of an East Kent team until 1781. There were seven major matches from 1781 to 1790 in which teams of this type faced each other, although there is doubt about the match titles with sources using different team names.\n\nThe first Kent Cricket Club was founded in Canterbury on 6 August 1842, formed out of the Beverley Cricket Club, and played its first match against All-England three weeks later. In 1859 a second county club was formed at Maidstone to support the Canterbury club, the two often being known as the East Kent and West Kent clubs respectively. The two clubs amalgamated in 1870 to form the modern day Kent County Cricket Club.\n\nTeams called East Kent and West Kent played each other twice in 1856 in minor matches. Those two matches are the last known to involve an East Kent team. West Kent became the name of a 19th-century club which played minor cricket only and was for a long time based at Chislehurst Cricket Club, with which it ultimately amalgamated in 1980 as the Chislehurst and West Kent Cricket Club.\n\nThe earliest known record of a \"West Kent\" or \"West of Kent\" team is in a match against Chatham Cricket Club on 7 August 1705, played at a place called \"Maulden\" in the primary source. There is no such place although it is generally believed to refer to Town Malling near Maidstone. The result and details of the teams are unknown. The next mention is a match on 22 September 1769, played at Sevenoaks Vine between West Kent and a Surrey team. The original report merely states that the wickets will be \"pitched soon after 10\".\n\nThe earliest known match involving an \"East Kent\" team is one played against West Kent at Sevenoaks Vine on 20 and 21 June 1781. The question of nomenclature arises here because, with at least three \"given men\" (i.e., borrowed players), on each side the match is also called Duke of Dorset's XI versus Sir Horatio Mann's XI after the two team patrons John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and Sir Horatio (Horace) Mann. The \"East Kent\" team, Mann's XI, included John Small, Richard Aubrey Veck and Lamborn of Hambledon and Hampshire. The \"West Kent\" team, Dorset's XI, featured the Hambledon players Noah Mann and Tom Sueter with the Chertsey and Surrey players William Bedster and Lumpy Stevens. Noted Kent players involved in the match include Joseph Miller, William Bullen, William Bowra, Robert Clifford and Thomas Pattenden. Sevenoaks Vine was Dorset's home ground and there was a return match at Bourne Paddock at Mann's Bourne Park House near Bishopsbourne from 8 to 11 August. This also featured guest players with Surrey's William Yalden and Hampshire's James Aylward joining Small, Lamborn, Sueter, Bedster, Mann and Stevens. Dorset's West Kent XI won both matches, the first by 10 wickets and the return by 106 runs.\n\nPart of the confusion around match titles comes from the ways in which Arthur Haygarth records matches. He calls the June match \"West Kent with Mann, Sueter & Lumpy versus East Kent with Small, Veck & Lamborn\", but then calls the August match \"Sir Horace Mann's Side versus the Duke of Dorset's Side\". In its \"Important Cricket Matches\" guide, the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians follows Haygarth by using the abbreviated titles \"East Kent with 3 gm v West Kent with 3 gm\" for the June match and \"Duke of Dorset v Sir H. Mann\" for the August match (\"gm\" meaning \"given men\").\n\nOn 25 and 26 June 1783, a match at Sevenoaks Vine involved \"West Kent with Harris, Stevens and Bedster versus East Kent\". East Kent won this by 2 wickets. A curious condition of the match was that Lumpy Stevens, generally reckoned the outstanding bowler of the time, \"was not to bowl, by agreement\". This would have severely handicapped his team, which lost the match, as he was not a good batsman and so, as Haygarth says, \"not much use as a given man\". Stephen Amherst, who was a Maidstone man and the patron of later West Kent teams, played in this match for the East.\n\nAmherst had become a match organiser by the start of the 1789 season and led his team to a five-wicket victory against that of Mann at Coxheath on 22 and 23 May. A contemporary report in the \"Maidstone Journal\" describes the game as \"Sir H. Mann with a select eleven of the County against S. Amherst, Esq. and the County at large, for 100 guineas\". The ACS calls the match \"Sir H. Mann v S. Amherst\". However, the next Mann-Amherst match on 29 and 30 June, also at Coxheath, is called \"East Kent v West Kent with each side having 4 gm\". This follows Haygarth, whose title is \"East Kent with Boorman and Four of Hampshire versus West Kent with Four of Surrey\". East Kent won by 8 runs and Haygarth confirms Mann and Amherst as respective managers. The guest players in this match were John Boorman, Richard Purchase, John Small, David Harris and Tom Taylor for the East and Billy Beldham, Harry Walker, Tom Walker and John Wells for the West. Apart from a couple of changes in the East Kent lineup, the same teams met again at Coxheath on 4 and 5 August, East Kent winning by 57 runs.\n\nThe final match between Amherst's West and Mann's East took place at Bishopsbourne from 7 to 11 September 1790. Haygarth called it \"East Kent with Purchase versus West Kent\". West Kent won by 130 runs. Sir Horatio Mann became MP for Sandwich in 1790 and reduced his involvement in cricket. The match in September 1790 is the last East Kent v. West Kent match that can be considered a major fixture.\n\n"}

{"id": "23937559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23937559", "title": "John 3:7 (sign)", "text": "John 3:7 (sign)\n\nA sign with the legend \"JOHN 3:7\" is often seen at Gaelic games stadiums in Ireland. It refers to a verse in the Gospel of John and for at least two decades has been displayed by fan Frank Hogan during matches. \n\nThe sign featured in the national media following its second disappearance in August 2009: Hogan launched an extensive, and ultimately successful, media campaign for its return before the next match. During that brief disappearance, bookmakers offered odds as to where it might next reappear and Paddy Power offered to purchase a replacement. The sign is so recognisable that, according to Hogan, \"everybody wants to steal it or buy it. People regard it as a trophy.\" However, this recognition would also make it difficult for anyone else to display the sign in the event of its theft.\n\n of the Gospel of John reads, \"Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’\"\n\nHogan, originally from County Tipperary, but living in County Limerick, carries the John 3:7 sign as \"a reminder that Jesus died for the sins of man\". Hogan originally had a sign which read \"\" but changed this to the well known JOHN 3:7 after the Michael Jackson concert in Cork in 1988.\n\nSome time after Hogan started bringing the sign to the GAA games, Shane O'Brien started taking it to various events around Ireland like the Rose of Tralee, Galway Races, Cork Jazz Festival etc... After doing this for a while he started recruiting a team to work with him on the streets at these festivals, and at weekends in Dublin. Some of this team also bring signs to GAA games to which Hogan can't make it. Since 2008, with the help of Philip Thompson, other teams have been formed in cities across Ireland and Britain. They just stand there on the streets with the signs ready to talk with anyone who stops to ask. Hogan said, \"People ask me what it means and I can tell them because they have asked.\"\n\nIn June 2010, Hogan was banned from displaying the sign in Croke Park. However, stadium director Peter McKenna claimed this was a mistake and that Hogan and the sign would be welcome in Croke Park any time.\n\nThe sign was first tossed from a train window by some fanatical supporters.\nHogan reported the sign missing again after a train journey which he undertook to return home from the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter-final between Kildare and Tyrone at Croke Park, Dublin on 2 August 2009. Hogan had placed the billboard between carriages, and he first feared it had been stolen when \"a lot of fellows got off and I discovered my sign was missing\" as the train passed through Kildare. After quizzing some of his fellow passengers, some suggested that there had been jokes about stealing the sign from some of those who had left the train. Hogan immediately contacted the Gardaí (police). CCTV footage of the train journey was viewed but the sign was not found.\n\nDuring its disappearance, bookmakers offered odds as to where it might next reappear, including such novelty bets as Gaelic games stadium Croke Park where it had last been displayed at a match, a lap dancing club, Dáil Éireann, the music festival Oxegen in 2010, or at religious sites such as Knock in County Mayo and the holy tree stump of Rathkeale in County Limerick. Paddy Power also offered to purchase a replacement. The sign eventually turned up at Kildare Garda station in time for the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship semi-final between Limerick and Tipperary. After making contact with the \"Leinster Leader\" newspaper, Hogan had returned from Dublin following an appearance on \"The Marian Finucane Show\", when he was informed that the sign had been retrieved. It then emerged that the sign had spent an evening in a Kildare public house before embarking on a minibus journey to the south of the country via Kildangan.\n\nAt the 2001 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final, Galway fans came up with their own sign, \"EUGENE 2:11\". This was in reference to Galway full-forward Eugene Cloonan, who scored 2-11 in the semi-final against Kilkenny that same year.\n\nOn 1 November 2009, the Irish-language television channel TG4 first aired a documentary about Frank Hogan and the JOHN 3:7 sign.\n\nA John 3:7 sign was present in the crowd during the Buffalo Bills historic comeback versus the Houston Oilers in a 1993 National Football League playoff game.\n\n"}
{"id": "393729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=393729", "title": "Lester Bird", "text": "Lester Bird\n\nSir Lester Bryant Bird, KNH (born 21 February 1938) was the second Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda from 1994 to 2004 and a well-known athlete. He was chairman of the Antigua Labour Party (ALP) from 1971 to 1983, then became Prime Minister when his father, Sir Vere Bird, the previous Prime Minister, resigned.\n\nBird was born in New York City on 21 February 1938. Lester and his elder brother Vere Bird Jr., also a British-educated lawyer, have been considered sometime rivals, with \"The New York Times\" writing in 1990 that Lester had always overshadowed his brother, according to those who have known them both. He was educated at Antigua Grammar School and was brought up as a Methodist. Bird was a cricket player in his youth, playing for the Leeward Islands, and a long jump champion. He won a bronze medal in the long jump at the 1959 Pan American Games in Chicago while representing the British West Indies. He attended the University of Michigan, where he was All-American long jumper in 1960 and graduated in 1962. Bird completed his study of law in Britain and was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1969. From 1969 to 1976, Bird engaged in private practice in Antigua.\n\nBird's political career began in 1971, when he was nominated to the Senate. The frequently-dominant Antigua Labour Party was in opposition for a five-year period. Bird was named chairman of the ALP and the leader of the opposition in the Senate. Lester continued to served as leader of the opposition until he was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1976 elections, when the ALP returned to power. Bird joined his father's government as Deputy Prime Minister. In addition to serving as Deputy Prime Minister, Bird also served as Minister of Economic Development, Tourism, and Energy. Bird's tenure as Minister of Tourism and Minister of Economic Development was controversial, and he personally benefited from tourism partnerships with foreign investors, including in the construction of the Royal Antiguan Hotel.\n\nFollowing independence in 1981, Bird gained the external affairs portfolio and was the first chairman of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States in 1982. He was chairman of OECS for a second time in 1989. The ALP government and Bird himself won re-election in 1994 and 1999. These elections, as well as the 1989 elections, were highly controversial; the 1989 elections were \"marred by irregularities and fraud\" and charges made by the opposition, described as credible by Freedom House, that the ALP used bribery and intimidation and exerted undue influence over the elections supervisor. The 1999 was deemed nor free or fair in an independent report which concluded that the opposition United Progressive Party (UPP) could \"conceivably could have won a majority of seats in parliament\" if the election had been fair.\n\nThe ALP had been divided by a succession crisis between Lester Bird and Vere Bird, Jr., since 1989. Lester Bird lost his deputy prime minister post in 1991, but retained the external affairs ministry and the planning and trade portfolio. Sir Vere Bird was initially thought to have favoured Vere Jr. until an arms scandal in which the elder son had been found to have been involved in the smuggling of weapons from Antigua to the Colombian Medellín Cartel. Vere Bird, Jr., then Minister of Public Works, was dismissed from office and an inquiry, led by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, Q.C., recommended that he never be allowed to hold office again (although he subsequently did return to office), boosting Lester Bird's chances to follow his father in the prime ministership and defusing pressure for Vere Bird to step down.\n\nIn 1992, another scandal, involving Sir Vere Bird's siphoning of public funds into a personal account, furthered calls for him to step down, with three opposition parties uniting to form the UPP under the leadership of Baldwin Spencer. Following a successful general strike called by the UPP, Sir Vere announced in March 1992 he would step down at the 1994 general elections. The ALP succession crisis continued following this, with a special convention to elect a successor on May 24, 1992 resulting in a deadlock between Lester Bird and John St. Luce, the information minister. The ALP leadership question was finally settled at the party's September 1993 convention, at which Lester won the leadership of the party, defeating St Luce, 169 votes to 131. The party post of ALP chairman went to Vere Jr.\n\nIn the March 1994 elections, the ALP under Bird's leadership won 11 out of 17 seats even as the opposition criticized the ALP over corruption issues. During the election the ALP pledged open government, an ombudsman to deal with citizen complaints, and new jobs, especially in tourism. Bird assumed the prime ministership on March 9, 1994. He appointed St. Luce (but not his brother Vere Jr.) to the cabinet. (Vere Jr. was subsequently named special adviser). Lester Bird took the portfolios for external affairs, planning, social services, and information for himself, and in a 1996 cabinet reshuffle also took the communications, civil aviation, international transport, and gaming portfolios.\n\nIn the 1999 elections, the ALP increased its parliamentary majority by one seat, holding 12 seats. Bird was reconfirmed as prime minister and elevated Vere Jr. to the cabinet as minister of agriculture, marking his full political rehabilitation. Bird also shuffled his own portfolios and by December 2002 held the foreign affairs, finance, legal affairs, justice, and national security ministries in addition to being the prime minister.\n\nIn the March 2004 election, the ALP was defeated by the United Progressive Party (UPP) led by Baldwin Spencer. Bird's party lost eight seats, and he himself was defeated by Errol Cort, who became Minister of Finance in the new UPP government.\n\nBird remained the ALP's political leader following the party's 2004 defeat. He led the party in the March 2009 election; although the ALP lost the election, it gained 3 seats from the UPP and Bird defeated Cort by 96 votes in the St John's Rural East constituency, where he had lost in 2004. He subsequently held the position of Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition.\n\nBird was succeeded as ALP leader by Gaston Browne in 2012, who led the party to victory in June 2014 general election. Bird won a seat and again defeated Errol Cort.\n\nIn 2014, he was made a Knight of the Order of the National Hero (KNH) by Antigua and Barbuda.\n\n"}

{"id": "29627891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29627891", "title": "Ruban Jaune", "text": "Ruban Jaune\n\nThe Ruban Jaune \"(English; Yellow Ribbon)\" is a cycling trophy created in 1936 by Henri Desgrange, awarded to the rider recording the fastest average speed in a professional cycling race or stage longer than 200 km. The trophy’s name is thought is to have come from comparison with the Blue Riband trophy awarded to the passenger liner crossing the Atlantic Ocean in record time. Desgrange changed the colour to yellow to reflect the newsprint of L'Auto, the sports newspaper he edited. The timing of the record must be by two independent timekeepers using certified timing equipment which has been recently calibrated. Because of these strict rules it was unofficially accepted in the latter part of the 20th century that only times in classic races would be accepted.\n\nThe first holder of the Ruban Jaune was Gustave Danneels of Belgium, who won the 1936 Paris–Tours in 41.455 km/h. Paris–Tours was long associated with the Ruban Jaune because its flat course, coupled with a following wind, makes for a fast speed. Jules Rossi of Italy took the record in 1938 when covering 251 km at an average 42.092 in Paris–Tours.\n\nThe suspension of top-class cycling during World War II meant Rossi’s record stood for ten years until April 4, 1948, when Rik Van Steenbergen won Paris–Roubaix at 43.612 km/h. The race had a violent tailwind. Van Steenbergen attacked at Hem 6 km from the finish, catching Emile Idée and Fiorenzo Magni and then beating Idée in a sprint in Roubaix Velodrome. In 1955 the record returned to Paris–Tours when Jacques Dupont covered the 253.7 km at 43.766 km/h.\n\nDupont held the record until 1962 when Jo de Roo won Paris–Tours at 44.903 km/h over 267.5 km. However, the previous year had two unratified claims. Jean Anastasi won a 218 km stage of the 1961 Paris–Nice between St Etienne and Avignon at 44.917 km/h. The record was not recognised because the course had not been properly measured. Also in 1961 Walter Martin of Italy won Milano–Torino in 45.094 km but this too was not accepted.\n\nIn 1964 Peter Post claimed the Ruban Jaune in winning Paris–Roubaix in 45.129 km/h,the race run at speed from the start. This was augmented by the final break at Attiches 33 km from the finish. It contained two riders from the Flandria team and three from Weils-Groene-Leeuw and they worked together to keep a high speed with the race decided in a sprint. Post’s record stood for more than a decade although the 1969 Milano–Vignola was initially won by Roger Kindt in a record average of 45.995 km/h before he was disqualified at the medical control and victory was awarded to Attilio Rota. Post’s record was beaten by Freddy Maertens in the 1975 Paris-Brussels, an average 46.11 km/h over 285.5 km.\n\nAndrei Tchmil set a record in 1997 when he won the 254.5 km Paris–Tours in 47.168 km/h. The race covered 49.3 km in the first hour and 48.9 km in the second. Tchmil beat Max Sciandri in a sprint after the two had broken away 5 km from the finish. Erik Zabel set a new best in the 2003 Paris–Tours of 47.55 km/h over 257 km, a brisk tailwind pushing the race over 51 km in the fourth hour as the riders flew down the Loire valley. Zabel eventually won the race in a bunch sprint in Tours. On October 10, 2010 Óscar Freire broke the record yet again in Paris–Tours, taking advantage of a favourable wind over a new shortened course of 233 km, he covered the distance in 4 hours 52 mins 54 seconds at an average speed of 47.730 km per hour.\n"}

Well known figures in the baseball world such as Bob Costas, Keith Olbermann, Craig R.

The headquarters also maintains a number of research tools on its website, including a lending library, home run and triple play logs, and course syllabi related to the game.\n\nSABR holds annual conventions in a different city each year. The conference generally includes panel discussions, research presentations, city-specific tourism, a ballgame, and an awards banquet. The 2007 convention in St. Louis, Missouri set the attendance record with 726 registered attendees out of approximately 7,000 SABR members. The organization also sponsors a baseball analytics conference in Phoenix and an annual Negro Leagues conference, held in a different location each year.\n\nThe Baseball Research Journal (BRJ) is SABR's flagship publication since 1972 for members to publish and share their research with like-minded students of baseball. The National Pastime is an annual, published from 1982 to 2008 as The National Pastime: A Review of Baseball History, when it was intended as a more literary outlet than the stats oriented \"BRJ\"; since 2009 it is a convention-focused journal, with articles about the geographic region where the convention is taking place that year.

It is affiliated with the Federation of International Polo (FIP) and the Hurlingham Polo Association.\n\nThe board of SAPA is made up of an elected President, a Vice-President along with an Executive Committee consisting of provincial representatives, Ladies Polo representative, amongst other members elected during the association's AGM. SAPA's constitution was originally instituted in 1905 confirming it as one of the earliest sporting organizations established in South Africa. SAPA administers the season fixtures list for competitions, the handicaps of both amateur and professional polo players, the resolution of disciplinary issues related to the sport, the coordination of development programmes for the formerly disadvantaged persons and the governing of policies associated with polo and polo ponies. SAPA is accountable for providing sponsorship for its representative national teams participating in several international polo matches and competitions.\n\nInitially polo was originally the domain of British cavalry, but it was army officers from the infantry that introduced the game to the country. The former 75th (Stirlingshire) Regiment of Foot, then acknowledged as Gordon Highlanders, after military service in Singapore and Hong Kong, was posted to the Cape Province, and was engaged in minor exercises in Lower Drakensberg. The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (the first Battalion), was stationed in South Africa around this time from Mauritius. The two regiments were based in King William’s Town, close to East London. The Cape Mounted Rifles, which was a local South African unit was also stationed in the area. The first polo game on record was played in October 1874, between the Cape Mounted Rifles and the Gordon Highlanders in King William's Town Parade Ground.\n\nPolo playing as a sport continued in Cape Town around 1885 at a polo club established by army officers, while in Natal, it was played by army officers based at Fort Napier. The following year, in 1886, the Garrison Polo Club was established in Pietermaritzburg. The Military Ninth Division engaged in polo matches around the 1880s at Harrismith, in the Free State, whereas the playing of polo in the Transvaal started in Johannesburg in 1894. The Dargle Polo Club was regarded as the first civilian club established in South Africa, although this claim is a subject of dispute by members of the Mooi River Polo Club. The South African Polo Calendar in 1902 noted the year of foundation as – 1886 for Dargle Polo Club and – 1889 for Mooi River Polo Club. Another of the pioneering civilian polo clubs was Tintern Polo Club, established around 1893. Subsequently, other civilian polo clubs established in the 1890s were Greytown, Durban, the Shaws’ Karkloof, Nottingham Road, Kokstad, Matatiele, Merino Walk and Underberg.\n\nPolo started in Port Elizabeth around 1888. The South African Polo Association was established in 1906 to which five provincial associations became its affiliates – East Griqualand, Highveld, Free State, KwaZulu Natal and the Cape. There are around 38 polo clubs in South Africa with an estimated 450 polo players. It was around the late 1940s and the early 1950s that women’s polo began in South Africa mainly through the efforts of Cicely FitzPatrick, that was highlighted when she launched the Addo Polo Club at Uitenhage, in the Cape Province. In 1932 the first officially recorded ladies' match was played between the ladies’ teams from Durban and Connington. In 1948, the Natal Ladies’ Polo Association was established.\n\nThe member associations are:\n\n\n"}

The film is directed by Stevefat and stars Liu Kai-chi, and . The film was released on 25 August 2016.\n\n1984 is a year where many changes take place, such as the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration as well as the opening of New Town Plaza and the first dragon boat race on Shing Mun River.\n\nTse Chi-lung \"Lung\" (), a resident of Wo Che Estate, and his neighbour and long-time friend Fan Chun-wai \"Wai\" (Tony Wu) enter Kei Kok College, a lowest-tier secondary school whose students' discipline is notorious in Sha Tin District. Kei Kok's principal, Lu Kwong-fai (Liu Kai-chi), receives fundings from the District Board with the support of District Officer Mr Tsang () to establish the territory's first Chinese teenage baseball team, which he believes can turn bad students good. Acting also as the coach, Lu recruits Lung, Wai and eight of their fellow schoolmates, who all live under uneasy conditions, to the baseball team named the Shatin Martins. He enforces strict discipline so as to remind the members to work and behave as a team, especially after their first humiliating defeat to a junior team.\n\nLung often looks up to Wai, who is smarter and physically stronger than him. Wai has started a romantic relationship with his schoolmate Tsz-ching () whereas Lung does not even dare to speak to Ling (Sadie Wang) whom he has a crush on. After Wai is chosen as the pitcher of the Shatin Martins, he takes pride in himself and belittles his teammates. In the first match of the Little League, Wai starts a fight with the rival team, prompting Lu to publicly replace him with Lung. Feeling betrayed by his friend, an ashamed, Wai withdraws from baseball and school, rejoins gang activities and abandons his now-pregnant girlfriend. Lung is at first angry with Lu for alienating Wai, but later reconciles with him. With the departure of the most outstanding member, the Shatin Martins work closer and train harder together, finally winning the tickets to the final of the league.\n\nRight before the final match, Lung experiences several shocks in his life. First, his family is torn apart by his mother's extramarital affairs. Second, although he has summoned the courage to speak to Ling, she has a boyfriend already. Third, he finds out Wai is involved in illegal acts in order to attempt to provide subsidy for Tsz-ching's abortion since she is now on her own after splitting with her family. But she refuses to give up her baby. Lu reminds him to stay focused as the half-a-step he takes at the pitcher's mound will decide the fate of the team.\n\nAt the final, the Shatin Martins have a hard match against the Japan-based Buffaloes, being far behind in four innings. Wai cannot keep his promise to show up to support them, as he is performing a dangerous mission. Worried about Wai, Lung fails to concentrate on playing and is hit in the face by the ball struck by the batter. As he falls onto the ground, he realises he must stand up by himself to prove himself capable to Wai. The Shatin Martins manages to come up from behind and eventually wins by 13-12, becoming the first Hong Kong team to win the championship.\n\nAlthough Wai is seriously injured, he survives and is taken care of at hospital. Lung learns how to adapt to changes, looking to his father and Tsz-ching as examples. Lu remains unmarried and dedicates himself to education and baseball. In recognition of the historic title, the government names a bridge over Shing Mun River after the team.\n\nOn the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Shatin Martins, Lung visits the Admiralty Occupy Site during the Umbrella Movement and recalls the spirit of not giving up hopes despite of failures.\n\n\nThe director Chan Chi-fat (Stevefat) and scriptwriter Wong Chi-yeung are alumni of the Academy of Film, Hong Kong Baptist University. Chan won the First Feature Film Initiative competition (Higher Education Institutions Group) of Creative Hong Kong in 2013 and was awarded a budget of HK$2 million by the Film Development Fund. Since the budget was insufficient to produce a normal-size commercial film, the crew had to mobilise support from fresh graduates and students of the Academy of Film. Many of the crew and the cast were underpaid or even unpaid.\n\nThe film was featured at the 40th Hong Kong International Film Festival in March 2016, where its tickets sold out quickly. It was distributed by Golden Scene and publicly released on 25 August 2016.\n\nBased on historical events, \"Weeds on Fires\" made some alternation for dramatic purpose. Historical photos and accounts were provided at the epilogue of the film. The historical Shatin Martins was established in 1982 whereas it was altered to 1984 in the film, in order to fit into the time-line of the story. The historical was the principal of Kei Kok Primary School instead of a secondary school; therefore, the Shatin Martins were formed by primary schoolers rather than teenagers. Mr Tsang, Sha Tin District Officer portrayed by Poon Chan-leung, was based on Donald Tsang, who provided elemental support in the establishment of the team and recalled it as the most memorable event during his service in Sha Tin.\n\n\n"}
