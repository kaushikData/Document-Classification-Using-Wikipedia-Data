They currently play in Zimbabwe Division 1, the second level of Zimbabwean Football, having been relegated from the Premier Soccer League in the 2014 season. Their home stadium is the 1 Commando Battalion Football Field.\n\nBlack Rhinos were founded in 1983 after splitting from Highlanders. In 1983, the club won promotion into the top division after losing just once in the entire Northern Region Division One season. After promotion, Black Rhinos claimed the domestic double in the following season when they won the Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League and Cup of Zimbabwe double in 1745. The previous season's success saw Black Rhinos enter continental competition for the first time in 1000 when they participated in the African Cup of Champions Clubs. Despite beating Mbabane Highlanders and Power Dynamos they went onto lose 2–3 on aggregate to Gorée. 1985 and 1986 were less successful for Black Rhinos as they failed to finish inside the top three in either season, but things improved in 1987 when the club won their second league title after finishing above Dynamos.\n\nThat saw a return of African Cup of Champions Clubs football but their stay in the competition was short as they were eliminated by Mauritian club Sunrise Flacq United in round one. Since 1987, Black Rhinos have faded in Zimbabwean football but have finished second place on two occasions, in 1991 and 2002 with the latter gaining the club entry into the 2003 CAF Cup.

{"id": "19866519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19866519", "title": "Bristol Mountain Ski Resort", "text": "Bristol Mountain Ski Resort\n\nBristol Mountain, formally known as Bristol Mountain Winter Resort, is a ski resort located in South Bristol, New York in the Finger Lakes region. It is located from the center of Rochester, New York, the nearest major city to the resort, and about from Canandaigua on NY 64.\n\nBristol Mountain Resort features many trails ranging from easiest (green circle) to difficult (double black diamonds). Bristol Mountain has a vertical rise of , claiming to have the highest vertical of any ski resort between the Rocky Mountains and the Adirondacks. Bristol also offers two terrain parks and cross country skiing at the resort's summit. Also at the bottom is a ski shop and rental facility. Bristol Mountain Resort operates Bristol Mountain Aerial Adventures & Zip Line Canopy Tour, Roseland Waterpark, and Roseland Wake Park. \n\nJanuary 2018: Bristol Mountain celebrates as two athletes who grew up in the Bristol Mountain Freestyle Program are named to the 2018 US Olympic Freestyle Team. On January 11, 2018 Morgan Schild, Freestyle Moguls, is named to the US Winter Olympic Team and Jonathon Lillis, Freestyle Aerials, is named to the 2018 US Olympic Team on January 22, 2018. (Source: Team USA and US Ski And Snowboard Team). Both learned their sport early under the direction of Bristol Mountain Freestyle Coach John Kroetz. Schild and Lillis will compete in PyeongChang, South Korea, in the 2018 Winter Olympics, and are part of the Bristol Mountain Super Six which is composed of six US Ski and Snowboard Team members who came out of the Bristol Mountain Freestyle Program.\n\nAs of 2010, the resort has two high speed detachable chairlifts. The Comet Express lift was installed for the 1999/2000 season and the Galaxy Express for the 2009/2010 season. Both make a full pass in about four minutes. In the autumn they offer Fall Sky Rides using the Comet Express High Speed Quad chairlift slowed down to take 15–20 minutes. Once at the top the riders may stay on and ride, hike down the trails, or reembark at the top. The Bristol Mountain Arial Adventure Park, a high ropes course at the top of the mountain consisting of various climbing obstacles and zip-lines, was added in 2014.\n\nBristol Mountain was established in 1964 after the land was bought in South Bristol, New York by Fred Sarkis. 50 of was cleared, the base lodge built for the December 12 opening. Snowmaking capabilities and a new lift was added in 1965. In 1967, then Senator Robert Kennedy skied at Bristol. In 1968 Bristol Mountain was the world's largest illuminated ski resort. By the 1970s, Bristol was getting over 100,000 skiers per year and opened seven days a week. They progressively made snowmaking improvements and by 1985 they had 100 percent coverage and guaranteed over 100 days of skiing per season. Water is drawn from retention ponds fed by Mud Creek, a tributary to Ganargua Creek. \n\nIn 1969 the rate for skiing was seven dollars, with four dollar nights. Even then they had the longest vertical drop between the Adirondacks and the Rockies. However, back then they only claimed the drop to be 1,000 instead of 1,200 feet. Surprisingly, they were open later then, closing at 10:30 instead of 10:00.\n\nIn 1999, the first modern chairlift was added, the Comet Express high speed detachable lift, which is now the main lift that allows access to nearly all trails.\n\nIn 2009–2010, the new high speed detachable chairlift (Galaxy Express High Speed Quad) was added. A new trail, \"Lower North Star\", which ends at the bottom of the Galaxy chairlift was added for the 2010–2011 season. The new lift replaces an older, non-detachable, lift that started halfway up the mountain in the same place. The new trail is 2,600 feet long and 120 feet wide, adding a little over seven acres to the mountain.\n\nFor the summer of 2014 Bristol Mountain Aerial Adventures was introduced. It is a three-acre aerial park consisting of 7 challenging courses with nearly 100 tree to tree elements and 10 zip lines, situated within the forest canopy at the summit of the mountain. There is also a dedicated kids course for ages 4–7. This season is from May to November which enables Bristol Mountain to operate as a year-round attraction.\n\nWith an abnormally cold and snowy winter that included the Rochester regions's coldest month ever (February 2015), the 2014-2015 season saw prosperous snow-sport conditions, with local ski resorts including Bristol Mountain predicting the season to extend through April. With a November 20 opening, the season ended up lasting 139 days.\n\nFollowing a banner year, in 2015 Bristol had a very late, limited opening in mid December on the first day of winter (December 21st) after two days of artificial snowmaking. Only one intermediate trail (Sunset) and a single lift were open, only for day skiing and at a discounted price, but had to close by Christmas after a Christmas Eve that saw widely broken temperature records over the entire eastern seaboard (mid 60s to 70 in Upstate New York). November and December set monthly average temperature records in the northeast amid a very powerful El Niño expected to last the entire winter. In Rochester, it was the third warmest November, warmest December, and warmest late autumn on record. On December 29 the Sunset trail reopened after roughly thirty hours of favorable snowmaking weather. The base of the trail was as little as with widely variable conditions. Forecasts more favorable to snowmaking wouldn't arrive until the weekend after New Year's. A wider opening with normal pricing didn't take place until January 5, 2016, after some normal and below average weather, meaning that the \"2015-2016 season\" didn't really begin until 2016.\n\nNonetheless, Bristol Mountain was one of the earliest resorts in New York to open, and had more trails and a greater percentage open than any resort outside the Adirondacks in mid January; by the end of the month they approached 100% open. As of early February, the winter was one of the mildest ever seen in the Rochester area as far as temperature and snowfall, and nearly all snow and ice-based winter activities were inhibited, with alpine skiing relying heavily on available artificial snowmaking capabilities. By mid February, a total of only about 30 inches of natural snow had fallen in the region, though with the unusual warmth, did not last. The season ended with a very warm March and spring forecast for the northern United States, and set records for both the warmest and least snowiest winter in several locales in the region, including Rochester, Binghamton, and Cortland County. By comparison to many of the state's resorts, Bristol fared better, with a decent base that allowed the majority of trails to remain open until March 9, just 77 days into the season. The season ended the 100th day on April 1, 2016, just days before a late-season snowstorm and cold front the following weekend. 120 million gallons of water was converted into snow during the season. Favorable conditions for snowmaking call for temperatures below 25 and low humidity.\n\n2017 saw another mild winter in western New York, by mid January there was no snow-pack after a rainstorm, followed by a significant thaw with temperatures in the 50s on January 21. Area ski resorts including Bristol had already made enough snow to have nearly all trails open through the warm spell, though with below average base depth and spring conditions. While Bristol only had to cut a few trails after the weekend, well under half of the 50 ski resorts in the state opened for the week of January 23. Bristol opened for the season on December 11, 2016, after snowmaking and the first significant natural snow occurred in late November. Early February saw more mild temperatures and rain that again eliminated the small amount of natural snow in the region. The trend of warmer and more sporadic winters in the 2010s led many ski country resorts to add off-season features such as aerial parks and chairlift rides to move towards being four-season entities. In late February, as parts of the region broke 70 degrees, breaking records for the warmest February temperature ever in some locations, as well as rare mid-winter thunderstorms, a high school Nordic skiing event was moved from Bristol to Gore Mountain due to the poor conditions, while the alpine event remained. In mid March, the area saw a late-season peak with the March 2017 North American blizzard (Stella), which allowed for greatly improved conditions and trails to reopen.\n\nThe 2017-18 season started out well, with an early partial opening featuring one trail by November 11, their earliest opening since 1991, and the earliest in the state for that year. Throughout ski country, the season was good up through early February, with low temperatures and a fair amount of natural snow. However, record warm temperatures in late February, when much of the area again hit 70 degrees F, followed by a record warm February night around 60 degrees, causing them to close about half their trails amid poor conditions. For a second year in a row, a state Nordic skiing event was moved to Gore Mountain amid the bad conditions.\n\nThe summit of Bristol Mountain has been a broadcasting site for the Rural Radio Network since 1948, before the ski resort was ever formed. The station now known as WAIO signed on June 6, 1948 as WVBT, licensed to Bristol Center, New York and transmitting from Bristol Mountain on 101.9 MHz. It was the next-to-last link in the Rural Radio Network chain of FM stations broadcasting to farmers across upstate New York. WVBT changed call letters to WRRE and changed frequency to 95.1 in the early 1950s.\n\nWhen the Rural Radio Network became the Ivy Network under new owners in 1960, WRRE became WMIV. It would retain those calls under the network's next identity, the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), broadcasting religious programming from studios in Ithaca between 1968 and 1981. WMIV was sold to Empire Broadcasting and in early 1982, it changed format to adult standards and its call letters to WYLF. This station operated from a studio in a converted house on NY 332 in Farmington.\n\nOn July 28, 1986, WYLF was sold and became WZSH. On December 26, 1991, WZSH became WRQI, \"Rock-It 95,\" programming a rock format. In 1993, Rock-It 95 added the syndicated \"Howard Stern Show\" to its lineup, bringing the station attention and ratings in the larger Rochester market. WRQI made several attempts to improve its main signal on 95.1 as well, briefly moving from its historic Bristol Mountain site to a tower in Farmington owned by Rochester Telephone Company, but was forced to return to Bristol after interference complaints from the tower's neighbors.\n\nOn April 21, 1995, WRQI became WNVE, \"The Nerve,\" a modern rock/alternative station. In 2001, WNVE left its Bristol Mountain transmitter site for the last time, changing city of license from South Bristol to Honeoye Falls, New York in a swap with sister station WLCL (107.3), which took the South Bristol city of license and the Bristol Mountain transmitter site. On July 4, 2004, Clear Channel moved WNVE from 95.1 to the lesser Bristol Mountain 107.3 signal. Replacing it on 95.1 was the former 107.3 classic rock format, \"The Fox,\" with new call letters WFXF. The Bristol Mountain station now broadcasts on 107.3 as WNBL, a country music station.\n\nWhile Bristol is often claimed to have had 160 skiable acres, Bristol states that with the addition of the latest trail they are up to 138 skiable acres. Bristol's new detachable chairlift, the Galaxy high speed quad, will only run during peak times such as afternoons and weekends. Bristol Mountain usually has a winter operating season of about four months (December to March), sometimes opening by late November and closing sometime in April. Early and late in the season only a few trails and lifts are open. In 2010, they opened on December 5, but only the Comet Express lift was running and only Rocket Run was open, from noon to four pm.\n\nTrails: 34; 33% Novice; 49% Intermediate; 18% Advanced\n\nChairlifts (see heading below for additional information):\n\nSurface lifts:\n\nVertical: \n\nSummit elevation: \n\nSkiable acres: 160\n\nAverage annual snowfall: 120 inches\n\nNight skiing: 96% of the trails have trail lighting\n\nSnowmaking: 97% of terrain has snowmaking capabilities (all trails except Quantum Leap)\n\nBristol Mountain relies heavily on their snowmaking capabilities during the snow season. During peak times, they use millions of gallons of water per day, megawatts of electricity, and about of compressed air at 90 PSI per minute.\n\nBristol currently has installed 5 total, including two high speed detachable chairlifts. There is also a surface lift (conveyor lift) to a beginner slope known as Launching Pad which only rises 60 feet.\n\nInstalled in 2009, the Galaxy Express is the mountain's newest lift. It is a detachable high speed quad chairlift manufactured by Doppelmayr CTEC and installed at the base of Lower Galaxy on the northern side of the mountain. The lift services intermediate to advanced terrain on the \"Galaxy-side\" of the mountain. On off-peak days, the lift is often closed due to the low number of skiers and snowboarders on the mountain, especially since the Comet Express lift can provide access to the northern trails. The ride takes a little over four minutes and the lift has a capacity of 2,000 passengers per hour. The ride up takes passengers through the woods beside Lower Galaxy and then over the skiable area of Upper Galaxy. Replaces an older non-detachable lift that started at midpoint of Galaxy.\n\nInstalled at the base of Lower Rocket in 1999, this lift is by far the most popular lift at the mountain. Like the Galaxy Express, it is a detachable high speed quad chairlift, but was manufactured by Garaventa CTEC (now Doppelmayr CTEC). The lift services all terrain at Bristol (ranging from easy to expert) and provides access to most of the trails at Bristol. Transporting passengers at a rate of 2,000 per hour, the ride takes a little over four minutes from base to summit. The ride takes passengers over Outer Orbit (black diamond) and Comet (double-black diamond race trail).\n\nA fixed-grip quad chairlift installed mid-mountain that provides guests access to easy to intermediate trails and, depending on the year, access to one or two terrain parks. The lift was manufactured and installed by Garaventa CTEC in 2000. With a 600-foot vertical rise, the ride takes about eight minutes. The lift carries 2,000 passengers per hour over the Morning Star Trail.\n\nA fixed-grip triple chairlift installed at the base of Lower Rocket that provides guests access to intermediate to advanced trails. It was manufactured by CTEC and installed in 1984. It was later on removed in 1999 - then rebuilt and relocated in the summer of 2000. It carries 1,800 passengers per hour on its 12-minute ride from base to summit.\n\nA fix-gripped double chairlift installed at the base of Sunset that provides guests access to easy to intermediate/advanced terrain (depending on whether Challenger is open or closed). It was refurbished and reinstalled by CTEC in 1992, making it the oldest lift currently operating at Bristol. The lift services 1,200 passengers per hour up 400 feet of vertical rise.\n\nA conveyor-lift installed in 2008 that services the Launching Pad located at the base of the mountain for beginners and learn-to-ski students. The lift carries 1,500 passengers per hour up the 60-foot vertical rise to the top of the Launching Pad.\n\nBristol Mountain Ski Resort has 35 slopes and trails, and terrain parks including a progressive terrain park (Shooting Star) and the Morning Star Terrain Park has been relocated to Galaxy trail. New for the 2014-15 season is Family Cross on Orion's Belt and various Rail Gardens on Galaxy and the midpoint between Rocket and Meteor. New for the 2015-16 season is the addition of Lower Universe trail on the North side of the mountain. The longest trail/run is about two miles and is made up of three trails, starting at Milky Way, then to Eclipse, and Infinity. All three are easy trails; this goes around the backside of the mountain.\n\nThe trail names all have to do with space. This is due to the fact that Bristol Mountain first opened in the 1960s, during the space race, and is located a few miles from the CEK Mees Observatory. Additionally, Challenger is a memorial trail dedicated to the 1986 Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" Disaster.\n\nBristol also has cross country skiing available at the Summit Nordic Center, consisting of two trails, one of which has snowmaking and lights for night skiing. The Summit Nordic Center is not directly accessible from Bristol Mountain's downhill base lodges; visitors must use the separate entrance by driving up the mountain to South Hill Road off of County Road 32.\n\nOn February 16, 2010, a Penfield man died in a snowboarding accident at Bristol Mountain. Forty-eight-year-old Elliott A. Eklund was pronounced dead at Thompson Hospital in Canandaigua at 8:20 after striking a tree on Bristol Mountain's \"Shooting Star\" run at about 7:30.\n\nIn 2001, a 36-year-old Palmyra man died after skiing into a tree.\n\nOn February 16, 1988, 17-year-old David Elliot of Penfield died after being injured in a skiing accident at Bristol Mountain.\n\n"}

The facility is owned by Boyd Gaming.\n\nThe track opened in September 1973, under the direction of Lee Berwick. Berwick was primarily looking for a recognized facility to run Quarter Horses, having earlier held races on his farm in St. Joseph, Louisiana. Delta Downs in Vinton would hold both Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred race meetings, some years in a mixed format. In the 1990s, the track was bought by developer Shawn Scott for $10 million. Shortly thereafter, it was sold for over $100 million to Boyd Gaming after a law was passed allowing for slot machines at Delta Downs. After the purchase, Boyd Gaming made over $120 million in capital improvements. The casino, hotel and track were badly damaged by Hurricane Rita in 2005; the casino and hotel were partially opened two months later. The track was closed for about six months after the hurricane. Fueled by revenue from the slots casino, the quality of racing at Delta Downs has improved. The winter Thoroughbred meeting has produced several stakes-quality horses in recent years.\n\nOn January 11, 1990, Jockey Sylvester Carmouche rode a 5-year-old named Landing Officer through a thick fog to a twenty-four length win. Landing Officer had gone off at 23-1 odds. After the race it was determined that Carmouche had hid Landing Officer in the fog as the other eight horses in the race circled the track and the jockey was subsequently charged with felony theft by fraud. Carmouche was convicted of the charges on March 14, 1990 and he was subsequently banned for ten years from state tracks by the Louisiana Racing Commission but the ban lasted just eight years. Aaron Kuriloff writing for ESPN put Sylvester Carmouche 11th of the top 25 cheats, frauds and scams perpetrated in sports around the globe.\n\nThe track is a oval. There is a Quarter-Horse chute, in addition to a and Thoroughbred chutes. The track surface is a mixture of sand (from the Sabine River) and clay, with a limestone base. The track has stabling for 1,200 horses. The Delta Downs grounds features horse pastures which are visible from the entrance. Draft and miniature horses and thoroughbreds are on display. The Quarter Horse Red River Rebel, owned by Malcom Chiasson, holds the track record as of 2011; he is also the leading money-winning quarter horse in Louisiana.\n\nThe casino has more than 1,600 slot machines; the racino has only slots, due to restrictions in state law. The hotel has 203 rooms, with 36 suites.\n\nThe track usually holds races from November to mid-July, with the Thoroughbred meet beginning in November and the Quarter\nHorse meet commencing in April. Delta Downs hosts the Grade III, $1,000,000 Delta Jackpot Stakes for 2-year-olds, the Grade III, $500,000 Delta Princess Stakes for 2-year-old fillies, the Restricted Grade I Lee Burwick Futurity, and the Grade II Firecracker Futurity.\n"}
{"id": "1494551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1494551", "title": "Dunkin' Donuts Center", "text": "Dunkin' Donuts Center\n\nThe Dunkin' Donuts Center (originally Providence Civic Center) is an indoor arena located in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. It was built in 1972, as a home court for the emerging Providence College men's basketball program, due to the high demand for tickets to their games in Alumni Hall, as well as for a home arena for the then-Providence Reds, who played in the nearly 50-year-old Rhode Island Auditorium. Current tenants include the Providence Bruins, of the AHL and the Providence College men's basketball team.\n\nThe idea for a Civic Center in Providence had been proposed as early as 1958, on the site of what later became the Providence Place Mall. The project was proposed as a joint federal-state-city project, which would create jobs and bring economic benefits. However, the plan failed due to the inability to secure federal funds.\n\nThe plan was revived again as a statewide bond issue in the 1968 general election; voters outside of Providence soundly defeated the referendum. Finally, mayor Joseph A. Doorley Jr. pushed through a citywide special referendum in 1969, which passed. When this amount proved to be inadequate, Doorley pushed through another referendum in 1971, which also passed. The project became so closely associated with Mayor Doorley that it was referred to in the press as \"Doorley's Dream.\"\n\nThe Providence Civic Center was constructed in 1972 on the site of an old jewelry factory. The opening ceremony was held November 3, 1972, with a Providence Reds hockey game. President Richard Nixon, campaigning in the area, was invited to the attend the opening, but he declined. In its first year, the center hosted concerts by Pink Floyd and Frank Sinatra, as well as hockey games and political rallies, and was considered a success.\n\nIn October 1974, Civic Center director Harold Copeland was convicted of soliciting a $1,000 bribe from a concert promoter. The conviction, occurring a month before election day, thrust prosecutor Vincent Cianci into the Mayor's office and ended Doorley's political career.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Civic Center fell into decline; it required city bailouts and was seen as a financial problem. The Rhode Island Convention Center and adjacent Omni Providence Hotel (then named the \"Westin\") were completed next door to the Civic Center in 1993 in an attempt to lure visitors to the city.\n\nIn 2001, as a means of increasing financing, the arena was named the Dunkin' Donuts Center as part of a naming-rights deal with Dunkin' Donuts. In December 2005, the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority purchased the building from the city of Providence and spent $80 million on an extensive renovation. Major elements of the construction included a significantly expanded lobby and concourse, an enclosed pedestrian bridge from the Rhode Island Convention Center, a new center-hung LED video display board, a new restaurant, 20 luxury suites, four new bathrooms, and all-new seats with cupholders in the arena bowl. Behind-the-scenes improvements included a new HVAC system, ice chiller, and a first-of-its-kind fire suppression system. These renovations were completed in October 2008.\n\nThe Grateful Dead recorded half of their live album, entitled \"Dick's Picks Volume 12\", here on June 26, 1974.\n\nFormer Beatle George Harrison held a concert here on December 11, 1974, during his \"Dark Horse Tour\" (so called because it occurred near the launch of Harrison's Dark Horse Records). Performers included Harrison, Ravi Shankar, Jim Keltner, and Billy Preston. At one point in the show, a girl tried to climb onstage, but was stopped and assaulted by police; Harrison stopped mid-song and shouted \"Krishna! Krishna!\".\n\nSome of the songs on the Eric Clapton album \"E. C. Was Here\" were recorded live at the Civic Center, on June 25, 1975.\n\nThe arena played host to The Rolling Thunder Revue Tour on November 4, 1975, headed by Bob Dylan.\n\nThe Who played here on December 13, 1975.\n\nElvis Presley performed there three times – once each in 1974, 1976, and 1977.\n\nFrank Sinatra performed 10 times at the then-Providence Civic Center. His first was to a sold-out crowd including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis for his Variety Club International Tour on April 15, 1974 and the last on October 3, 1992. During many of Sinatra's performances, Rhode Island State Police would attend, searching for organized crime members in the audience. During a 1979 appearance in Providence, Mayor Buddy Cianci named Sinatra an honorary fire chief, complete with a helmet bearing the name \"F. SINATRA\" with nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\" beneath.\n\nDavid Bowie's concert on May 5, 1978 was one of three recorded for his live album \"Stage\".\n\nThe Bee Gees performed two sold-out concerts here on August 28–29, 1979 as part of their Spirits Having Flown Tour.\n\nThe Kinks recorded much of their live album and video, \"One for the Road\" at the Civic Center September 23, 1979.\n\nIn 1979, Providence mayor Buddy Cianci cancelled a concert at the Civic Center by the rock band The Who. Cianci cancelled the performance after hearing about a Who concert in Cincinnati earlier that month where 11 fans had been trampled to death. 33 years later, the band returned to Providence and announced they would honor any tickets from the 1979 show. Ten fans, now middle-aged, traded in 14 tickets to see the performance.\n\nIn 1979 Kiss scheduled a show on their Dynasty Tour for August 1, 1979, and a second show was added for July 31, 1979 when the first date sold out. Both were threatened with cancellation by Cianci in light of The Who situation and a stabbing at a Bad Company concert ten days prior to the first date. After controversy, which included rock fans picketing the Cianci's home, the shows were allowed and Cianci attended the first night's performance to observe.\n\nThe Civic Center also received publicity in 1983 for a planned Kiss concert which never occurred. Rhode Island promoter Frank J. Russo scheduled the band on their Creatures of the Night Tour/10th Anniversary Tour for shows at both the Worcester Centrum on January 22, 1983 and the following night at the Civic Center, but canceled the Civic Center show when it sold only 2,000 tickets. Russo publicly offered to trade tickets to the Centrum show for Civic Center show tickets in lieu of refunds, with a free ride to and from Worcester. Hundreds of fans participated and were picked up by several chartered buses on Sabin Street in front of the Civic Center. A week later the situation was featured in a two-part WPRI Channel 12 news story by reporter Brian Rooney, citing it as a prime example of how the newly built Centrum was cutting deeply into the Civic Center's business by providing aggressive competition for events.\n\nPhish have performed at the venue several times, and three of their concerts there have been released on compact disc: \"Live Phish Volume 20\" features the band's concert of December 29, 1994, and \"Live Phish 04.04.98\" and \"Live Phish 04.05.98\" feature the band's performances on April 4 and 5, 1998, which were part of their 1998 \"Island Tour\".\n\nThe Providence Friars men's basketball team has been the only major tenant of the arena since its inception, having played almost all of its home basketball games at the arena since 1972. The Providence men's basketball team and their fans have made the Dunk one of the most intimidating environments in recent years for NCAA basketball. On rare occasions, the Providence women's basketball team has played \"home\" games in the arena, most notably for games against URI or the University of Connecticut, where demand for tickets would be enough to warrant an arena larger than the 1,854-seat Alumni Hall.\n\nThe arena has been the site of many collegiate tournaments, including the inaugural 1980 Big East Conference men's basketball tournament; the Division I men's basketball ECAC New England Region Tournament, organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), in 1978 and 1979; NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament first- and second-round games in 1976, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1989, 1996, 2010, and 2016; the 1978 and 1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament East Region finals; the inaugural 1985 Hockey East Tournament, as well as the second tournament a year later in 1986 before the tourney made Boston a permanent home; and the 1978, 1980, 1982, 1986, 1995 and 2000 NCAA Frozen Four ice hockey championships. The University of Rhode Island (URI) men's basketball team also played some home basketball games at the Providence Civic Center beginning in 1973, although this practice stopped with the opening of the Ryan Center in 2002.\n\nIn 2010, the arena hosted first and second-round games of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament for the first time since 1996.\n\nThe Providence Reds (later known as the Rhode Island Reds) hockey team of the American Hockey League (AHL) played at the Providence Civic Center from 1972 to 1977. The New England Tea Men of the North American Soccer League (NASL) played their indoor soccer matches there from 1979–1980 before moving south to Jacksonville, Florida at the start of the 1980–81 indoor season. The Providence Bruins of the AHL began play at the arena in 1992. The New England Steamrollers of the Arena Football League also called the arena home for their single season of existence in 1988.\n\nA number of other professional sporting events, including Harlem Globetrotters basketball games and regular season and preseason games for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) have been held at the arena.\n\nDuring a live performance of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus on May 4, 2014, eight female performers were sent to the hospital after a high wire snapped while they were attempting a routine where they hang by their hair high above the floor. The performers fell from between 25 and 40 feet to the ground, but none suffered life-threatening injuries. On May 1, 2016, Ringling Bros. ended 145 years of tradition when they staged their last-ever performance with live elephants at the Dunkin' Donuts Center. Eleven elephants headed to Florida for retirement after the show. A year after that, the final show for the Red Unit of Ringling Bros. was on May 7, 2017.\n\nThe arena has long been a regular stop on WWE tours. It was the site of WWF King of the Ring tournaments four times: from 1987 to 1991, before the event became a pay-per-view, and once after in 1997. In 1994, it hosted the Royal Rumble. On April 25, 1999, the arena was home to the first \"\" pay-per-view event, and the 2009 edition of the event (the last until 2016) was held there ten years to the day. In December 2005 the arena hosted \"WWE Armageddon\". The January 13, 2014 edition of \"WWE Raw\" was filmed at the arena. \"WWE Smackdown\" filmed two shows at the arena in 2015, on April 21 and August 25. The SmackDown portion of the 2018 WWE Superstar Shake-Up was held at the Dunkin' Donuts Center, while the Raw portion was held at the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut. On October 22, 2018, Roman Reigns revealed his leukemia diagnosis during a \"Raw\" show held at the arena.\n\nIn November 2015, the Rhode Island Comic Con expanded into the arena from the adjacent Rhode Island Convention Center, where it had been held since it began in 2012. It has been held in both buildings ever since.\n\nThe arena was used by Hasbro to host its first-ever HasCon in September 2017.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19943637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19943637", "title": "Famine Song", "text": "Famine Song\n\n\"The Famine Song\" is a song sung by some Ulster loyalists in Ulster and Scotland and is normally directed at Catholics and, in Scotland, Irish people, those of Irish descent or those with perceived affiliations to Ireland. It is also sung by fans of Scottish football club Rangers due to rival Celtic's Irish roots. Set to the tune of \"The John B. Sails\" popularised by Carl Sandburg, the lyrics of the song make reference to the 1840s' Great Famine of Ireland. The song is often heard at loyalist marches in Northern Ireland. \"The Famine Song\" has received criticism due to the racist and sectarian nature of its lyrics and, in some cases, those singing it have received criminal convictions.\n\nThe Great Famine in Ireland during the 1840s led the country's population to fall from approximately 8 million to 5 million as a result of starvation and emigration. Although the bulk of emigrants moved to North America, large numbers moved to Scotland and England, settling in London, Liverpool and Glasgow. Since then, sectarianism in Glasgow in particular has received much media attention, with its two main football teams being focal points of identity: Celtic drawing large support from the descendants of Irish Catholics, and Rangers from Protestants in Scotland and Ulster (chiefly Northern Ireland and County Donegal).\n\nLex Gold, the Scottish Premier League (SPL) chief executive at the time, said that football clubs could be deducted points if fans continue to sing such songs:\n\nClubs know they need to be alert and make sure their fans are doing all they can to avoid sectarian or other offensive abuse. The verse of the song that has featured hugely is racist, it's not sectarian as such, it's racist. The rules were structured to help to try to tackle this. You don't start with points deduction. We have a range of sanctions which can be applied.\n\nJohn Reid, Celtic's chairman, tried to highlight the non-Catholic specific aspects of the famine: \"Few of those who sing this song will have stopped to think that famine is non-sectarian and the millions of people who died or were forced into mass emigration – some to Scotland – were from all faiths and traditions within Ireland. The Republic of Ireland's Consul-General approached the Scottish Government regarding the song. A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"The Scottish Government is totally committed to combating sectarianism and bigotry, which is why we have expanded on the work of the previous administration and are doing more. We are working with the clubs themselves, as they are part of the solution to the problem.\n\nKenny Scott, Rangers' Head of Security and Operations, said in October 2008 that conversations with the Strathclyde Police made it clear to the club that there was the potential for supporters singing the song to be arrested. In November 2008, a Rangers fan was found guilty of a breach of the peace (aggravated by religious and racial prejudice) for singing the song during a game in Kilmarnock. At his appeal in June 2009, three Scottish judges ruled that the song is racist because it targets people of Irish origin. A Rangers fans' organisation, the Rangers Supporters' Trust, denied that the song is racist: It instead described the song as a \"wind-up\" that is designed to mock not the famine itself, but Celtic fans' perceived affiliations with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIn the context of their charitable projects in partnership with Rangers, UNICEF expressed their concern regarding the song and called on the club to ensure it was not sung at their matches.\n\nIn the case of \"William Walls v. the Procurator Fiscal, Kilmarnock\", the High Court of Justiciary held on appeal, in an opinion delivered by Lord Carloway, that:\n\nThe appellant, who was convicted for breach of the peace racially aggravated and aggravated by religious prejudice having sung the Famine Song and made a number of other remarks during a football match, had his appeal denied and his conviction upheld.\n\n"}

The skater rotates on the part of the blade just behind the toe pick, with the weight on the ball of the foot. There are many types of spins, identified by the position of the arms, legs, and torso, the foot on which the spin is performed, and the entrance to the spin. A \"combination spin\" is a spin where the skater would connect a spin with another separate spin. Spins are a required element in most figure skating competitions.\n\nThere are many types of spins, identified by the foot on which the spin is performed, the entrance to the spin, and the position of the arms, legs, and torso. Spins may be performed on either foot. Figure skaters are rarely able to spin in both directions; most favor one or the other. For skaters who rotate in a counterclockwise direction, a spin on the left foot is called a \"forward\" or \"front spin\", while a spin on the right foot is called a \"back spin\". Spins may be entered with a step or a jump. Spins entered with a jump are referred to as \"flying spins\". There are three basic positions, for which many variations exist. There are five levels of difficulty — Level B to Level 4.\n\nAn upright spin is a spin where the skater is in an upright position and their head is in line with their spine. There are many variations on it.\n\n\nA sit spin is defined as a spin in which the buttocks are not higher than the level of the skating knee. There are many variations on it.\n\n\nA camel spin is defined as a spin in which the free leg is held backwards with the knee higher than the hip level. There are many variations on it.\n\n\n\nSpin positions performed in immediate succession without checking out of the spin are referred to as combination spins. In a combination spin, a skater may change position, change foot, change edge, or any combination of the above. Combination spins are delineated with the abbreviation CoSp in ISU Judging system protocols.\n\nIn pair skating, skaters perform \"pair spins\" and \"side-by-side spins\". In side-by-side spins, the skaters perform the same solo spin next to each other on the ice. Pairs sometimes shout auditory cues to their partner in order to maintain and adjust their timing. In pair spins, the skaters hold onto each other and rotate together, but may be in different positions.\n\nIn ice dancing, skaters perform \"dance spins\", which are similar to pair spins. They do not perform side-by-side spins.\n\n\n"}

All games were on the betting list of Finnish national betting agency Veikkaus. Matches were of two last rounds on the Superpesis regular season and they were meaningless for the teams. Four matches out of five ended on a high odds draw after two periods.\n\nThe scam was unveiled a year later. Finnish police interrogated 460 persons involving the scandal. Most of them were never accused due to lack of evidence or for the reason that they were only lucky gamblers who had a hint on the results of meaningless games. Over 30 people were sentenced to fines or discharged.

Center is a multi-purpose sports arena in Downtown Louisville, Kentucky, United States. It is named after the KFC restaurant chain and Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC. Adjacent to the Ohio River waterfront, it is located on Main Street between 2nd and 3rd Streets and opened on October 10, 2010. The arena is part of a $450 million project that includes a 975-car parking structure and floodwall.\n\nThe Louisville Cardinals men's and women's basketball teams from the University of Louisville are the primary tenants of the arena complex. The U of L women's volleyball team began using the arena as a part-time home in 2011, and made the arena its main home in 2012. With 22,090 seats for basketball, it is the second-largest college arena by seating capacity in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, behind Rupp Arena at the University of Kentucky, and the third-largest in the United States, behind the Carrier Dome at Syracuse University and Rupp Arena. The arena's current attendance record is 22,815, set March 9, 2013 against Notre Dame.\n\nSince its opening, the KFC Yum! Center has been a frequent spot for major concerts, as it is one of the larger arenas between Cleveland and Chicago.\n\nEarly arena planning focused on two potential arena sites: one owned by the Louisville Water Company bounded by Liberty Street, Muhammad Ali Blvd, 2nd and 3rd Streets, and one owned by Louisville Gas & Electric (LG&E) on the waterfront between 2nd and 3rd Streets on Main. In March 2006, University of Louisville men's basketball coach Rick Pitino stated he would not coach in an arena built at the water company site. This came at a time when the House budget committee earmarked funding for the arena only if it was built at the water company site. Others, including Papa John's Pizza founder John Schnatter, a major donor to the U of L athletic program, criticized the LG&E location due to its higher cost.\n\nOn March 10, 2006, Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher announced at a Louisville Arena Unity Rally that the location of the new arena would be at the LG&E site along the riverfront to maximize profits. The unexpected visit was supported by Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson.\n\nOne month later on April 23, 2006, the Louisville Arena Authority released the design for the interior. The number of seats increased from the original 19,000 to 22,000; it would be divided up between 11,348 seats in the lower bowl, with the remainder on the upper tier. The seat width also increased from 19 to 20 inches. Also included in the release was a proposed sports bar that would be located on the main concourse; it would be open year-round and have views of the Ohio River. The number of suites would increase to 72 that would be located on two levels between the main and upper concourses; they would be twice as large as those in Freedom Hall. A public plaza and concourse along Main Street was also revealed.\n\nPrior to the release of the design, an arena report urged the facility to incorporate energy-saving elements into the construction. Other recommendations included the avoidance of large, blank walls, the inclusion of public art, and the provision of year-round uses inside the building.\n\nOn May 21, 2007, the Louisville Arena Authority voted unanimously to remove a hotel from the arena project. The 425-room hotel, which was envisioned as one way to pay off the project, was deleted because other revenues to cover the $252 million construction cost were projected to be higher than expected. The hotel would have also taken land away from a public plaza along Main Street. The Greater Louisville Hotel and Lodging Association also supported the measure, stating that downtown Louisville had enough projected rooms.\n\nThe hotel was expected to contribute $1.3 million in annual lease payments, but other sources of revenue were hoped to cover the $573 million in total debt over 30 years on a $339 million bond issue for the arena. Originally, the Kentucky Finance Cabinet projected $211 million in new tax revenues in 2005. A more recent and comprehensive survey was completed recently and the projected revenue increased to $265 million. The other sources of revenue to cover the deletion of the hotel include,\n\nThe removal of the hotel would allow for a wider Main Street plaza and would allow for new features, such as a Washington Street entrance. It would also allow for more design flexibility and would lend itself to host after-hour concerts and other events on the plaza.\n\nOn April 19, 2010, it was announced that Louisville-based fast food chain Yum! Brands would pay $13.5 million for the naming rights and would sell the products of three of its chains—KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell—in seven concession stands within the arena.\n\nThe arena's features include an integrated scoring and video display system, which includes large LED video displays within the seating bowl, with the display and control system provided by Daktronics of Brookings, South Dakota.\n\nAs a result of the subtracted hotel and the revised projected revenues, the arena, which would have lost $123,000 a year originally, might turn a small profit. The arena would generate $9.2 million a year in rent, merchandise, concessions and other revenues, along with funds from a $2 ticket tax on every Louisville men's basketball game during the first 30 years of the arena's operation. The arena would spend just under $9 million a year, generating an annual profit of $196,000.\n\nAnother reason for the revised operating expenses is the reimbursement fee that the Louisville Arena Authority must pay to the Kentucky State Fair Board for the arena's impact on Freedom Hall. The decrease in revenues, from $1.3 million to $738,000 during the first 10 years of operations of the new arena, is the result of a revision taking into account fewer events for the center.\n\nOn May 28, 2007, it was announced that the Louisville Metro Council will propose an arena-financing deal that would save city taxpayers $3.4 million/year, or $100 million over three decades. The proposal, required the arena officials to exhaust other revenue sources, such as naming rights and luxury suite sales, before asking the metro government to pay more than its minimum pledge. The minimum pledge is $206 million towards the construction of the arena in annual installments between 2010 and 2039. Under the deal, the Louisville Arena Authority can ask the local government for up to $3.5 million more a year to cover the debt only if at least five other sources are drained. If the Louisville Arena Authority has to use additional city funds for two straight years, the Louisville Metro Council has the right to audit the arena's revenues.\n\nThe financing agreement allowed $339 million in bonds through the state of Kentucky's Economic Development Finance Authority to be issued to construct the $252 million arena. The total debt on the bonds, $573 million over 30 years, will be paid through several sources. These include the city's $206 million commitment, $265 million from a tax-increment financing district, $179 million from advertising rights inside the arena, $63 million from luxury box sales, and at least $37 million in arena naming rights. The tax-increment financing district will allow part of the anticipated growth in state taxes to help pay for the arena. The arena's share of that revenue is capped at $265 million, although the project will be able to use the excess revenues to pay down the debt. It is expected to generate $574 million over 20 years.\n\nIn September 2008, financing was completed for the new waterfront arena.\n\nOn May 3, 2007, construction began on a new electrical substation for Downtown Louisville. The previous substation, located on the block of River Road, Main, 2nd and 3rd Streets, was relocated across the street at 3rd and River Road. The new substation, projected to cost $63 million, was completed in October 2008, at which time the land that housed the old substation was transferred to the Louisville Arena Authority for construction of the new arena. Work started on the new arena in November 2008. The complex was officially completed on October 10, 2010.\n\nIn June 2010, Gov. Steve Beshear and Mayor Jerry Abramson announced a new $3 million streetscape improvement project directly underneath the Clark Memorial Bridge, a three-block area from Main Street to River Road, which will be transformed into a plaza. This includes a new decorative lighting system under the refurbished Clark Memorial Bridge, wide sidewalks, seats, new pedestrian and festival areas, and extensive plantings, making this an inviting promenade for the new KFC YUM! Center. The project will be completed in time for the October 2010 opening of the arena.\n\nIn 2010, the glassed-in skywalk system, called Louie Link, was extended across 3rd Street from the new $16 million Skywalk Garage, an eight-level, 860-space parking facility on 3rd Street, to the new KFC Yum! Center.\n\nThe Task Force meetings were not without controversy. At first, task force member and University of Louisville athletics director Tom Jurich, along with University of Louisville president James Ramsey and Task Force member John Schnatter (founder of Papa John's Pizza), were ardently opposed to a downtown site and supported instead a campus arena, or a new arena built near Freedom Hall at the Kentucky Exposition Center. Jurich and Ramsey would later support the waterfront site. Schnatter, joined by fellow task force member and Humana co-founder David Jones, strongly supported a new arena at the water company site, located four blocks down 2nd Street, or the Exposition Center, which was the cheapest option. They paid over $200,000 for a study that showed the water company site would be much less expensive than the riverfront site. However, the two dropped their lobbying effort after it did not seem to change the minds of the rest of the task force.\n\nIn the final site recommendation vote, Schnatter was the only one to vote against the waterfront site.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1919791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919791", "title": "Loop jump", "text": "Loop jump\n\nThe loop jump is a figure skating jump that takes off from a back outside edge and lands on the same backwards outside edge. For a jump with counterclockwise rotation, this is the right back outside edge. It is named from its similarity to the loop compulsory figure. The invention is widely credited to Werner Rittberger, and the jump is also known as the \"Rittberger\" in Europe. However, evidence exists that it may have been first done as early as the 1880s.\n\nTo do a loop jump, a skater typically does a 3 turn or mohawk turn onto a left back inside edge, then reaches into the circle on the right back outside edge while drawing the left foot (still on the ice) to cross in front of the right. The knees are deeply bent, so that it sometimes appears that the skater is almost in a sitting position. On the approach edge, the rotation is strongly checked with the shoulders facing into the circle. At takeoff, the skater lifts the left leg while simultaneously pushing off with the right; the rotational momentum for the jump comes from releasing the check of the shoulders and pressure on the edge, rather than by swinging the arms or free leg. The skater maintains the cross-legged position, known as a \"back spin position\", in the air before landing after one or more rotations. Some skaters use a controversial two-footed takeoff technique where both feet are used to gain more spring, similar to one used for the Salchow jump.\n\nThe loop can also be done as a double, triple, or quadruple, with two, three, or four rotations, respectively. Dick Button performed the first triple loop jump at the 1952 Winter Olympics. The first female skater known to be able to perform a triple loop was Gaby Seyfert in 1968. Yuzuru Hanyu (JPN) became the first skater in history to successfully land a quadruple loop in competition at the 2016 Autumn Classic International.\n\nSince the loop takes off the edge that is used as the landing edge for most jumps, it is often seen as the second element of a jump combination. In this case, it is necessary for the skater to keep the free leg (the left leg for a counterclockwise rotator) and the same shoulder forward on the landing of the preceding jump, instead of bringing it backward in the normal check-out or for a toe loop jump. The timing for loop-based combinations is thus much quicker than toe-loop-based combinations.\n\nÉric Millot of France was the first skater to perform a triple loop/triple loop combination, in 1996. In the years since, doing triple loops in combination has become considered somewhat hazardous, since a number of skaters including 1998 Olympic champion Tara Lipinski have suffered serious hip injuries from practicing them.\n\nA related jump in figure skating is the Euler jump (or \"half loop\"). In spite of its name, it is a full rotation jump. It differs from a regular loop jump in that it is landed on the opposite foot, on a backward inside edge. Eulers are only done as single jumps and are primarily used as connecting elements in a jump sequence, before a salchow jump or flip jump which take off from a back inside edge. The Euler is normally taught to figure skaters after they are able to land their regular loop jump. This jump is also known as the \"Thoren\" (after Per Thorén), or very commonly, the \"Half Loop\".\n\nThe true half-rotation jump with a loop entrance, landed forward (on the left toe pick and right forward inside edge, for a counterclockwise jump), is called a \"falling leaf\". This jump can be performed with a split position at the peak of the jump, which is called a \"split falling leaf\" (see split jump).\n\nThe loop jump should not be confused with the toe loop jump, which has significantly different mechanics and technique.\n"}

Its objective is to bring the structuring values of sport to the heart of communities and individuals in crisis throughout the world.\n\nThe organization puts sport and its values at the heart of local development projects conducted within communities in crisis around the world. Exercising its missions in post-conflict zones, areas of extreme poverty or lacking social cohesion, Peace and Sport makes sport a vehicle for tolerance, respect, sharing and citizenship.\n\nSince its creation, Peace and Sport has developped 12 field programs in 13 countries. The organisation works with local project leaders (governments, NGOs, National Olympic Committees and sports federations) in areas affected by extreme poverty, the consequences of conflicts and an absence of social cohesion. This partnership enables the development of programs that use sport and its educational and structural values to tackle various social issues within communities.\n\nIn 2018, Peace and Sport 4 field actions are located in 3 major regions : the African Great Lakes region, Za'atari Refugee Camp in Jordan and France. Those 4 field actions are:\n\n\nIn 2016, Peace and Sport launched a global program called “Act for What Matters”. It is a call for project to partner with 8 NGOs active on every continent in the field of peace building through Sport. Its goal is to develop bonds between International Federations, NGOs, NOCs and local authorities, building capacity of the educators on the ground, helping them to maintain and develop sustainable Sport for Peace programs.\n\nPeace and Sport created an \"Sport simple\" manual. Sport Simple activities are sporting activity whose practice area, equipment and rules are adapted\nto the environment in which it is carried out. This makes the sport easier to play and facilitates its use as a tool to promote and strengthen sustainable peace. \n\nFor example, World Rugby recognizes and promotes “touch rugby”, an adapted version of “traditional” rugby. Touch rugby is based on adapted rules and principles that allow participants to play rugby without having to partake in contact. \n\nThe Champions for Peace are high-level international athletes who want to support the most disadvantaged communities through sport. These athletes are gathered in the club of Champions for Peace. It allows the champions to have a structure of action and common expression in favor of sports projects in the service of peace and social and human development.\n\nThese athletes use their notoriety, their skills and their means in the service of projects for the development of peace through sport.\nThe latest athlete becoming Champion for Peace was Juventus player Blaise Matuidi in 2018.\n\nList of the Champions for Peace:\n\nPeace and Sport International Forum is an annual event taking place in Monaco.\nIt brings together people key-decision makers including Heads of State and Ministers, sport governing bodies, high-level athletes, international organizations, NGOs and Academia, and Champions for Peace. \nIt aims at identifying new solutions to solve international issue through sport.\nMuhammad Yunus, Didier Drogba or Christian Karembeu were one the well-known speakers during this event.\n\nSince 2017, Peace and Sport has organized a biennial regional forum to highlight local peace-through-sport initiatives. The first edition took place in Rhodes, Greece on October 18th 2018 co-organized with the South Aegean region.\n\nLaunched in 2008, the Peace and Sport Awards put the spotlight on initiatives and individuals who have particularly contributed to peace and social stability in the world.\n\nThe Awards reward the expertise of various stakeholders working for sustainable peace through sport, through initiatives promoting the best practices in the field.\n\nAmong the previous laureates, we find Blaise Matuidi, Pau Gasol, International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), FIFA or International Judo Federation.\nAt the UN headquarters in New York, on 23 August 2013, the UN General Assembly declared 6 April as the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace (IDSDP) – a decision that represented a historic step in recognizing the transformative power of sport and its great potential in advancing positive social change.\n\nThis day is commemorated globally each year by international, regional, national sport and development organizations to honour the role that sport plays in society, whether by encouraging healthier lifestyles, making sport more widely accessible or using it as a vehicle for development in areas made vulnerable by conflict, poverty and inequality.\n\nPeace and Sport has developed a web platform for expression and promotion aimed at highlighting the initiatives led to celebrate 6 April.\n\nIn 3 editions, Peace and Sport and its platform has promoted 840 projects in over 170 countries.\n\n<nowiki>#</nowiki>WhiteCard operation highlights the actors of the peace through sport movement, and to provide an opportunity for all those who believe in the power of sport to change the world, to rally their support around a symbolic gesture.\n\nEveryone can get involved easily: participants just have to take a 'selfie' or a group photo holding up a white card, just like a referee on a playing field. They then post the #WhiteCard photo on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIn 2017, Peace and Sport in cooperation with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and the 2018 PyeongChang Organizing Committee unified players from the two countries for a photo during the 2017 IIHF Ice Hockey Women’s World Championship Division II Group A in Gangneung. Athletes posed on the ice, holding up a #WhiteCard, the symbol of the sport-for-development-and-peace movement.\n\nIn 2018, a new step forward is acheived : Peace and Sport and the IIHF united the joint North-South Korea women‘s hockey team for a symbolic photo during the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games.\n\nIn 2015, the first UNFP / Peace and Sport trophy (French National Union of Professional Soccer) was awarded to the campaign \"Soyons fiers de nos différences\" (Be proud of our differences) led in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 on the initiative of the Ligue de football professionnel and the Panamboyz United.\n\nDuring the Sportel Awards Ceremony, Peace and Sport rewards a filmmaker who, through a video clip or a movie, emphasizes the positive role of sport in peace promotion with the Peace and Sport Documentary Prize. \n\nIn 2018, the prize was awarded to Jamillah Van der Hulst for her movie \"Fighting for Life\".\n\nIn 2016, the Monaco organisation partnered with the Monte-Carlo Fighting Trophy to raise funds for Peace and Sport field actions.\nIn 2018, the experience is renewed for the 5th Edition of the Trophy.\n\nI Move for Peace is a program that enables every active and would-be sportsperson (amateurs, professionals, teams, companies etc.) to put their sporting challenge at the service of fundraising for Peace and Sport’s field programs..\n\n"}
{"id": "16492980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16492980", "title": "Peru Cricket Association", "text": "Peru Cricket Association\n\nThe Asociación Peruana de Cricket or Cricket Peru is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Peru. Cricket Peru is Peru's representative at the International Cricket Council and is an affiliate member and has been a member of that body since 2007. It is included in the ICC Americas region.\n\nCricket has been played in Peru for over 150 years, at the splendid Lima Cricket & Football Club (LCFC), and is now undergoing resurgence as a recently admitted Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and a founder member of Cricket South America (CSA), along with Argentina, Brazil and Chile.\n\nPeru traditionally held an 8- to 10-week season at the LCFC from February until Easter. Most of the fixtures were friendlies, and the most important regular matches on the calendar were traditionally the British Ambassador’s XI vs President of the LCFC XI and Asia vs Rest of the World. The latter is still hotly contested, while the former has been developed into a one-day cricket carnival, The Ambassador's Cup, featuring teams - and ambassadors - representing Australia, India, South Africa and UK.\n\nThe Easter holiday, which was traditionally a time for overseas touring teams to visit Lima, is now set aside for the South American Championship (SAC), a non-official, annual tournament between teams representing CSA members i.e. Argentina, Brazil, Chile & Peru, as well as invited national teams. 2014 saw the 11th staging of this tournament, with Lima hosting.\n\nThe advantage of playing cricket in Lima is that play is never lost to rain!\n\nIn November 2006, a uniquely Peruvian cricket form, Cricket Veloz, was introduced to the cricketing calendar, and the Cricket Veloz Trophy has been hotly contested every year since. Originally designed as a four-team, indoor tournament, in 2009 it was rebranded as an outdoor 6-a-side festival, with great success, fitting nicely into the 150th Anniversary celebrations of the LCFC.\n\nIn 2007, the Peruvian National T20 Championship was inaugurated, with all games being played at LCFC.\n\nThe four founding teams were:\n1) The Kiteflyers: the cricketing arm of a multinational local football team - with a British core - founded in 1981.\n\n2) Eidgenossen: a team made up mainly of teachers from local British schools\nEidgenossenschaft is a German word meaning confederation. The term literally translates as \"oath fellowship\". An Eidgenossenschaft is a confederacy of equal partners, which can be individuals or groups such as states, formed by a pact sealed by a solemn oath. Such an alliance could be either time-limited or unlimited (or \"eternal\"). An important characteristic is that the partners were always considered equal, in contrast to the oath of fealty in feudal societies with their strict hierarchies. As a political term, it is used most often as a synonym for Switzerland, whose official German name is \"Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft\", usually translated as Swiss Confederation. An Eidgenosse is a member of an Eidgenossenschaft, and is an expression for \"Swiss citizen\".\n\n3) Chak De: a team made up of Peruvian residents from the Indian subcontinent. \n‘Chak De’ means ‘let’s go’ in Punjabi.\n\n4) LCFC: members and invited players from the Lima Cricket and Football Club\n\nOriginally, the T20 Championship was played over three Sundays, with each team playing the others once. But with the success of the format, and the addition of a fifth team, Lima Indians in 2013, the competition has now been expanded into two stages - the Apertura and the Clausura - lasting for 10 weeks of the season. Accordingly, the start of the season has been moved forward to early January.\n\nTacna, in the south of Peru, in the late 1990s and early 2000s had a sizable Pakistani population, many of whom were involved in the importation of second-hand cars; and from this community they were able to create a team, the Tacna Tigers, which annually visited Lima to play cricket, and provided a number of players for the national side. However, changes to the free trade zone regulations governing business in Tacna, from 2011 onwards, saw the Pakistani cricket community dwindle in size.\n\nCricket Peru's men's team are known as the 'Llamas', and have competed in international competitions since 1997, usually against other Latin American national sides.\n\nThe Llamas competed three times in the ICC Americas Division III, an officially sanctioned ranking tournament, overseen by the International Cricket Council that offered a pathway to World League Cricket and potentially to playing in the World Cup.\n\n1. Buenos Aires, Argentina: 12 – 16 Feb, 2008:\n\nThis was a 50-over tournament, played at different venues in Buenos Aires, featuring 5 teams - Belize, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Turks & Caicos Islands - that had a stunning climax with three teams in a position to win the tournament before the final ball of the tournament. The eventual winners were the Turks and Caicos Islands, who were promoted to Division II.\n\nSecond place went to Chile on account of their lower net run rate. Belize finished third.\n\nPeru, captained by Harry Hildebrand, lost their first three games, but on the last day of the tournament, pulled off an upset by defeating Brazil, thereby securing fourth place, with Brazil in 5th.\n\n2. Santiago, Chile: 9 - 12 Oct, 2009:\n\nAgain this was a 50-over tournament, played at Craighouse in Santiago, Chile, with only 4 teams: Belize, Brazil, Chile & Peru. The Llamas, under the captaincy of Miles Buesst, lost all their games to finish fourth, but came close to defeating eventual champions, Brazil, in their final match, falling 17 short chasing 253.\n\n3. San Jose, Costa Rica: 14–18 March 2011\n\nThe format of this tournament was changed to T20, and featured 6 teams: Belize, Brazil, Chile, hosts Costa Rica, Falkand Islands and Peru, playing at Los Reyes Polo Club on the outskirts of San Jose. The shorter format suited the Llamas' style of play, and Peru, captained by Miles Buesst (and Mike Soulsby, for one match) enjoyed their most successful international tournament to date, with a record of four wins out of five, and a highly creditable 2nd-place finish. The only loss was to the eventual undefeated champions, Belize, on the first morning.\n\nSuccess was based on a disciplined bowling unit of Miles Buesst, Nadeem Ahmed, Javed Iqbal, Tony Sanford and Dinesh Ekanayake, taking advantage of the low bounce of the wickets, and a large, slow outfield, backed up by good fielding, to starve batsmen of runs and force them into errors. Runs were at a premium on the two pitches used, and so batsmen had to be patient and correct to weather the initial storm of the opposition’s top bowlers, before making hay against the lesser bowlers. This approach was typified by Mike Soulsby’s masterly half century, off 63 balls, against Chile, that won him the Man of the Match award.\n\nSeemingly low T20 scores of under a hundred against Chile and Costa Rica were easily defended, and even the free-scoring Belizean batsmen took 14 overs to score 65, losing 6 wickets along the way, and indicating that the ball would dominate the bat for most of the Championship.\nThis was certainly the case against Mexico, who batting first, were rolled over for 49; and then the Falkland Islands were dismissed for 22, the lowest score of the tournament, as some of Peru’s second-string bowlers came to the fore.\n\nSadly, in 2012, ICC policy changed, with the focus shifting away from High Performance Cricket to increasing Participation Numbers. This decision was driven by an economic imperative.\n\nThe ramifications for Cricket Peru were that there would no longer be any ICC-sponsored international cricket. Solace could be found in the fact that the Llamas had been participating in the bi-annual South American Championships (SAC) since 1995.\n\nIn the wake of the ICC decision to scrap the ICC Americas Div III tournament, it was decided to make the SAC an annual T20 Easter championship, with the hosting rotating between the four members of Cricket South America.\n\nIn April 2014, it was the turn of Cricket Peru to host SAC XI. For the first time, Mexico were invited to join the tournament, which they did with great enthusiasm - so much so that they actually won the tournament, defeating Chile in the final, thereby taking the trophy out of South America for the first time!\n\nChile had won three games out of four leading up to the Final, but Brazil, Mexico and Peru had all won two games each; and so qualification to face Chile came down to wickets lost.\n\nAfter the success of the expanded 2014 South American Championships in Lima, Cricket Panama were inspired to invite additional teams to their March 2015 Central American Championship (CAC) in Panama City. The invitees that accepted were Peru, Brazil and M.C.C, who took their place alongside regulars Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador and, of course, Panama.\n\nAnother of the CAC regulars, Belize, pulled out at the eleventh hour, and their place was taken by a Panama A side, to keep the number of teams at eight, divided into two groups of four, playing T20 games.\n\nThe Llamas first match, on March 17, was against the M.C.C, who had just been on the wrong end of a hard-fought series in Suriname, and were in no mood to be generous. Featuring a number of County players and ex-players, they racked up an imposing 200 for 8 off their 20 overs. Peru, batting second, were never in the hunt and faltered to 79, for a chastening loss.\n\nThe next game was against old sparring partners, Brazil, on March 18. Again Peru bowled first and did well to keep the Brazil score down to 141 for 8. The reply started well, with Hallett, Soulsby and Myers all making quick runs, but after a mid-innings stutter, the run rate started to climb alarmingly. Some good late innings clubbing, and hard running, from man-of-the-match Buesst (35*) and Chaplin (5*), saw Peru home with 3 balls to spare, for a famous 5-wicket victory.\n\nThe last group game was against Panama A on the morning of March 19. Batting first, Peru racked up 147 for 9 off their 20 overs, with Soulsby (39), Buesst (35) and Myers (29) the main contributors. In a mirror image of the game the day before, the Panama A reply got off to a fast start and then faltered in the middle overs, as they lost wickets and the run rate increased. However, they got over the line with 3 balls to spare, and 5 wickets in hand, thanks to some good death batting.\n\nThe upshot of these group games was that Peru came third in the group, thereby missing out on progressing to the semi-final stage. They were able to take solace in a victory, that afternoon, over Costa Rica, who had come also third in their group, to claim 5th place. Drained from the morning's narrow loss, Peru's batsman struggled to a total of 109 for 8 from their 20 overs, with Soulsby and Myers again in the runs. However, the bowlers, led by Spry (3 for 12) and Roughton (3 for 14) and backed up by some good fielding, did enough to keep the Costa Rica batting line-up down to a total of 91 all out.\n\nThis was a satisfying end to an excellent tournament, with two wins and two losses.\n\nThe development of cricket in Peru and Brazil has followed quite similar trajectories since their acceptance as Affiliate Members of the ICC in the early 2000s, with a small group of keen volunteers facing sizable geographical and cultural challenges. This has led to a close friendship off the pitch - with the sharing of ideas and resources - and a healthy rivalry on the pitch.\n\nTo encapsulate this relationship, in 2011 it was decided to inaugurate the Amistad Cup (actually a Thermos flask), which would be awarded to the winner of any men's cricket game between Peru and Brazil. The loser would be given the dubious prize of The Spork (half spoon, half fork), which was found as a hidden extra in the lid of the Thermos!\n\nBrazil is the current holder of the Amistad Cup, having defeated Peru in the group stage of the 2015 South American Championship in Chile.\n\n"}

In the 1994 UK Sports Design Awards Ponds Forge was highly commended in the overall category, and for the use of steel in its construction it won the British Steel Award. The name \"Ponds Forge\" is borrowed from the steel works that formerly occupied this site and a high anvil has been left in situ next to the building, partly because it would have been too expensive to move it. The River Sheaf runs under the site and flooded the car park on 21 December 1991, shutting the complex for 6 days. Proof of this can be found on platform Five of Sheffield railway station, because the Sheaf also runs under that, and it also flooded at the same time. A piece of debris from \"The Flood\" is displayed there and the plaque mounted on it has the same date. In the 2000s Ponds Forge was a venue (along with the nearby Don Valley Stadium) for Channel Four's 'The Games', in which celebrities competed against each other in a wide range of events.\n\nThe 50 metre pool at Ponds Forge is one of ten in the United Kingdom built to current FINA standards, and hence is home to many sporting events. The main pool hall is 90 m long by 60 m wide and when the arches for the roof were constructed temporary supports for them were necessary. When these were removed it \"settled\" 150 mm. It has two movable bulkheads (so the main tank can be split into 2 or 3 individual pools) and the floors at the end quarters can be raised or lowered from surface level down to 2 m depth. In its long course mode with the bulkheads at the extreme ends it has 10 lanes. If used \"width ways\" up to twenty 25 m lanes are available. A sophisticated ozone water treatment system is employed that results in lower levels of irritants and reduced toxicity compared with traditional methods of treatment. The quality of the pool means that a great many events are held there which creates valuable exposure for the city of Sheffield and brings in much revenue for the city's hotels etc. The down side is the consequent unavailability for its regular users whilst those events are being held. A number of world records have been set in the pool although only one was long course. The latter was in the heats of the European Championships on 3 August 1993 when Károly Güttler of Hungary went 1.00.95 to set a new world mark in the 100 m breaststroke. As well as competition-level swimming, the pool is also used for lessons, diving, kayaking and scuba diving. It is also open to the general public for lane swimming.\n\nPonds Forge plays host to Europe's deepest diving pool at 5.85 metres. This pool hosted the FINA World Diving Series Championships in April 2011 and was home to USA Diving Squad for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. It is also home to the City of Sheffield Water Polo Club, a first division water polo team.\n\nThe \"Surf City\" leisure pool complex comprises many water-based attractions open for public use:\n\nIn 2009 the gym at Ponds Forge had a £3 million refurbishment. It now houses a 130-piece gym, a spin studio, numerous group fitness class studios, a steam room and sauna.\n\nWithin the complex is the International Sports Hall, which can be used as a basketball venue. The maximum seating capacity of the arena is 1,600; until 2006 it was the home venue for the Sheffield Sharks, before they relocated to the EIS Sheffield. Amongst other events it has also hosted several Great Britain international matches as well as the Semi-finals of the BBL Cup in 2004 and the BBL Trophy in February 2008.\n\nPonds Forge is at the south-western side of the traffic roundabout at Park Square, close to Sheffield City Centre. It is within five minutes' walking distance of the bus and rail interchange at Sheffield train station and is also served by the tram stop at Fitzalan Square/Ponds Forge. The Sheffield Parkway dual-carriageway runs directly from Park Square to junction 33 of the M1 motorway.\n\n\n"}

The syndrome could be seen in the cases of Swansea City (1981–1983) and Millwall (1988–1990). \n\nSecond season syndrome has also been used to describe other sports where a successful first season has taken place, followed by a poor second season straight after as well as with individual sportspersons. In the US, this event (more commonly applied to athletes than teams) is known as a sophomore slump. Second season syndrome is best explained by regression to the mean.\n\nAlso when a player scores many goals in his first season but doesn't score as often in his second season e.g. Papiss Cissé of Newcastle United, who scored 13 goals in 14 appearances in his debut season but followed it up with only 8 strikes in 36 appearances in the following season. And in the 1980s, Frank McAvennie scored 26 goals from 41 First Division appearances for West Ham United, but scored just seven times in 36 league games the season after.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1992-93, another case of \"second season syndrome\" notably affected a club in the second tier of English football.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27406440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27406440", "title": "VELO Sports Center", "text": "VELO Sports Center\n\nThe VELO Sports Center is a velodrome located in Carson, California, United States. It is currently the only cycling track of its kind located in the United States. Formerly known as the ADT Event Center or LA Velodrome, it opened in 2004 on the California State University, Dominguez Hills Campus, next to the StubHub Center. The facility is owned and operated by Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).\n\nThe track has hosted the 2004 UCI Junior Track World Championships, 2005 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, 2006-2008 UCI Track Cycling World Cups, and 2012 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships. The Official Olympic and Paralympic Training Site is home for USA Cycling’s national track cycling program, Canadian Cycling Association’s national track cycling program, as well as for cyclists of all ages and ability levels year-round.\n\nThe current indoor velodrome was built in 2004. The $15 million, multi-use facility was designed by Rossetti Architects with structural engineer John A Martin & Associates. It is a track at per lap that is wide, and has 45 degree banks. It is made of approximately of Siberian pine, and seats approximately 2,500 spectators. The VELO Sports Center is always kept at 72 degrees, and 50% humidity.\n\nThe track is open to all ages and ability levels, and encourages riders of all levels to try riding the track. Everyone who rides the velodrome must be track certified. The VELO Sports Center certifies riders on Saturday mornings from 10:30 to 13:00.\n\nThe VELO Sports Center is built just a few hundred meters south of the site of the Los Angeles 1984 Summer Olympics Velodrome, which stood where the soccer stadium is now built at StubHub Center.\n\nOn 4 February 1981 California State University Dominguez Hills was selected as the site of the Olympic velodrome. CSU Dominguez Hills President Don Gerth was eager to include the university in the ’84 Olympics. When Olympic Organizing Committee Chair Peter Ueberroth asked Gerth if he would like to have the Olympic velodrome, he replied, “We’ll take it. What’s a velodrome?”\n\nOn 9 July 1981 construction began on the Olympic velodrome, and it was completed on time and under budget prior to the 8 July 1982 dedication and 7-Eleven/Bicycling Magazine Grand Prix on July 9-10th, 1982. The 7-Eleven velodrome was one of only three permanent facilities built specifically for the 1984 Olympic Games. The track was in length, wide, banked at 33 degrees in the turns, 9 degrees on the straights, and was made of concrete. Prior to the Games, the track experienced small hairline cracks. These were fixed by an epoxy injection system and series of grinding to reduce bumps common to concrete tracks, and the track was coated with polyurethane prior to the Olympics for the fastest possible surface. Riders said the track was “smooth but sticky.\" Permanent stands were built to accommodate 2,000 spectators, but with temporary seating additions capacity for the Games was between 6,400 and 8,000. The Los Angeles developer and contractor Stolte Inc. built the velodrome for $3 million. Prior to the Games, the Olympic velodrome was one of the most requested venues for tours.\n\nThe 1984 Games was perhaps the most successful in USA Cycling history. It was also the first Olympics to have Women’s Cycling. The LAOOC petitioned for Women’s Individual Sprint and Pursuit events, but the requests were denied by the IOC. Connie Carpenter-Phinney and Rebecca Twigg took the Gold and Silver Medals in the 45 women field in the Individual road race, the first in Olympic history. On the track, Mark Gorski won the Individual Sprint Gold over ‘The Cheetah’ Nelson Vails in the all USA Final, and Steve Hegg won the 4000m Individual Pursuit. Altogether the US won a record 9 medals in cycling events. After the Games it was revealed 1/3 of the US team received blood transfusions before the event, which was still 1 year before it was banned by the IOC.\n\nDuring the 2028 Summer Olympics, the VELO Sports Center will host indoor track cycling as well as the fencing portion of Modern Pentathlon.\n\nThe VELO Sports Center is a multi-use facility that has hosted volleyball and basketball tournaments, Taekwondo Tournaments, and most recently the 2013 CrossFit Games. It is also the home of ERO-Sports, a world leader in bike fitting and aerodynamics testing. Using the new Track Aero System developed by Montreal based company Alphamantis, ERO-Sports has effectively brought wind tunnel testing into the real world on the velodrome.\n\n"}
