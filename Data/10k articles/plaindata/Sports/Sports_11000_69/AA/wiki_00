{"id": "6129782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6129782", "title": "Basketball (ball)", "text": "Basketball (ball)\n\nA basketball is a spherical ball used in basketball games. Basketballs typically range in size from very small promotional items only a few inches in diameter to extra large balls nearly a foot in diameter used in training exercises. For example, a youth basketball could be in circumference, while a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men's ball would be a maximum of and an NCAA women's ball would be a maximum of . The standard for a basketball in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is in circumference and for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), a maximum circumference of . High school and junior leagues normally use NCAA, NBA or WNBA sized balls.\n\nAside from the court and the baskets, the basketball is the only piece of equipment necessary to play the game of basketball. During the game, the ball must be bounced continuously (dribbling), thrown through the air to other players (passing) or thrown towards the basket (shooting). Therefore, the ball must be very durable and easy to hold on to. The ball is also used to perform tricks (sometimes called freestyling), the most common of which are spinning the ball on the tip of one's middle finger, dribbling in complex patterns, rolling the ball over one's shoulder, or performing aerobatic maneuvers with the ball while executing a slam dunk, most notably in the context of a slam dunk contest.\n\nNearly all basketballs have an inflatable inner rubber bladder, generally wrapped in layers of fiber and then covered with a surface made either from leather (traditional), rubber, or a synthetic composite. As in most inflatable balls, there is a small opening that allows the pressure to be increased or decreased.\n\nThe surface of the ball is nearly always divided by \"ribs\" that are recessed below the surface of the ball in a variety of configurations and are generally a contrasting color. A brownish orange surface with black ribs and a possible logo is the traditional color scheme of basketballs but they are sold in various colors.\n\nBalls are generally designated for indoor (generally made of leather or absorbent composites), or all-surface use (generally made of rubber or durable composites, also known as indoor/outdoor balls). Indoor balls tend to be considerably more expensive than all-surface balls due to cost of materials. In addition, brand new all-leather indoor balls must be \"broken in\" first to achieve optimal grip before use in competition. The abrasiveness of asphalt and the dirt and moisture present in an outdoor setting will usually ruin an indoor ball within a very short period of time, which is why an indoor/outdoor ball is recommended for recreational players. Outdoor balls are commonly made from rubber to cope with rougher conditions, and they need to be filled with more air to retain a suitable level of air pressure in colder weather.\n\nDifferent sizes are used for different age groups. The common standards are:\n\nNote that the ball used for all competitions (men's, women's, and mixed) in the formalized halfcourt game of 3x3 combines characteristics of the size 6 and size 7 balls. Its circumference is that of a size 6 ball, but its weight is that of a size 7.\n\nIn early December 1891, the chairman of the physical education department at the School for Christian Workers (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, Canadian instructed physical education teacher James Naismith, known to many as the inventor of basketball, to invent a new game to entertain the school's athletes in the winter season. Naismith assembled his class of 18 young men, appointed captains of two nine-player teams, and set in motion the first ever basketball game, played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets tacked to either end of the gymnasium.\n\nThe first purpose-built basketballs were made from panels of leather stitched together with a rubber bladder inside. A cloth lining was added to the leather for support and uniformity (identity). A molded version of the early basketball was invented in 1942. For many years, leather was the material of choice for basketball coverings, however in the late 1990s, composite materials, like synthetics were put forth and have rapidly gained acceptance in most leagues due to their superior performance in harsh outdoor game conditions.\n\nFrom 1967 through 1976, the American Basketball Association (ABA) used a distinctive red, white and blue basketball that is still seen from time to time.\n\n"}

{"id": "24084164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24084164", "title": "Fortissimus", "text": "Fortissimus\n\nThe Fortissimus is a defunct event in strength athletics. The name means \"the mightiest\" and was a multi-event challenge at the end of which the winner is crowned as the \"Strongest Man on Earth\". It was set up to bring together the strongest competitors on the planet independent of the organisations to which they were signed, and also as a tribute to the nineteenth-century Canadian strongman Louis Cyr, which gave it many similarities to Le Defi Mark Ten International which last took place in Canada in the early 1990s. After its first airing in 2008, the strength athletics magazine Milo described it as the ultimate strongman competition ever held. Despite a successful edition in 2009, a reported lack of a major sponsor for 2010 resulted in the competition being suspended, no future contests have been announced.\n\nThe world of strength athletics in 2008 was fragmented, with a number of individuals being able to lay claim to be the strongest in the world by virtue of having won mutually exclusive events. Athletes affiliated to IFSA Strongman were not allowed to compete in the World's Strongest Man (\"WSM\"), which is produced by TWI and thus neither the WSM and its associated WSM Super Series nor the IFSA circuit can claim to have a comprehensive field of the top athletes. Some events did exist that bridged the divide between the major organisations, such as the Arnold Strongman Classic. Fortissimus was to be another such bridge but with a difference. The driving force behind the event, Paul Ohl, is one of the world's leading authorities on the great Louis Cyr, the nineteenth century strongman and want to create a competition to honour this man, said to have been the strongest man in the world. Fortissimus was set up to be the all-inclusive strength and power package to demonstrate \"the essence of the sport of strongman is the multi-disciplinary array of tests of global strength, resulting from a combination of static (brute) strength, overall explosive power and power grip, strength athletics mastery, endurance and stamina\". The concept was to link with the tradition of strongman and to honor the memory and deeds of the great Louis Cyr. Ten events, called the Classical Events, were incorporated into the programme.\n\nThe night before Day 1 of the 2008 event the athletes were honoured at a banquet hosted by Paul Ohl and was attended by the townspeople of Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire, where the event was being held, and the mayor of that town. Mayor Carl Dubé welcomed the athletes to Notre Dame du Rosaire in June 2008 and thousands of spectators flocked to see many of the world’s top strongmen perform, including Zydrunas Savickas, Derek Poundstone, Andrus Murumets, Travis Ortmayer and Mikhail Koklyaev. The event was lauded across the strongman world, with the likes of Ironmind and Milo magazine praising it. So popular was it that a three-year deal with the Regional Community of Montmagny, Quebec was soon struck with the newly formed Fortissimus World Strength board. Derek Poundstone won the event in spectacular fashion. With the final event left, the Natural Stones of Strength, Zydrunas Savickas was 5 points clear of Poundstone. The three huge stone in the event were the 350 lb Bill Kazmaier stone, the 400 lb Paul Anderson stone and the giant 517 lb Louis Cyr stone. The winner would be the best time or most stones loaded. Some of the athletes lifted one stone, others the second. When it came to the third, the Cyr stone that only Louis Cyr had previously lifted over a century before, most athletes passed on it. Some touched it but did not attempt to lift it. Zydrunas Savickas, having lifted the first two in an astonishing 8.8 seconds, tried the Cyr stone but managed to lift it just one inch before deciding it was too much. Poundstone took 11 seconds over the first two stones, significantly quicker than all others except Savickas. Savickas is reported to have raised his hands in victory at seeing this time. However, his celebration was to have been premature. To the astonishment of the athletes, the crowd and even the organisers, Poundstone managed to move the stone. Screams of amazement were said to have come from the crowd. Inch by inch he raised the stone and eventually placed it on the platform. Later, Paul Ohl was to say to Derek Poundstone \"You know, you weren't supposed to lift that stone. I put it in the competition as a tribute to Louis Cyr. Whoever is able to lift that stone would be considered an heir to Louis Cyr.\" Having lifted the fabled Cyr stone, Poundstone had the honour of having his name added to the stone, being the only man other than Cyr to lift the giant weight.\n\nOne of Paul Ohl's key strengths is his ability to involve the local community, including the regional press, to increase the presence of the event. The 2009 competition saw Marcel Catellier, the chief commissioner of the Regional Community of Montmagny, as chairman of the board, in charge of the general administration of the new corporation and Paul Ohl as president of the event.\n\nZydrunas Savickas reversed the results of 2008, where he came second, to clinch the title in 2009, with Poundstone coming second. Prior to the event, to further enhance the events standing a pre-tournament competition was held, the World Championship Rolling Thunder on June 26, an event which determined which athlete has the greatest grip strength in the world. Mark Felix successfully defended his title in this event.\n\nThe 2010 edition was suspended. Canada World Strength noted in a formal statement: \"Since the precondition for the holding of a third edition resided mainly in the arrival of a major sponsor by early December and that this condition has not been reached, the organizers have no choice but to [suspend] the 2010 edition.\" However, the door was held open for 2011 with the statement continuing: \"“The Board, however, does not abandon the idea of holding a third edition in 2011.\".\n\nIn 2008 Paul Ohl stated that the Strongman Champions League was one of three organisations that had made an agreement with Fortissimus in order to unite the world strength community, the others being the American Strongman Corporation, and the Aussiepower organization. Within the agreement, Fortissimus, the competition that confers the title of \"Strongest Man on the Planet\", guaranteed that the winner of the America's Strongest Man title would be granted a slot in Fortissimus from 2009, as would the winner of the Australia's Strongest Man title. The agreement with the Strongman Champions League went further, stating that the top three athletes would have guaranteed places and in return the top Canadian athletes would have guaranteed selected participation in the Champions League. This later went further, guaranteeing the SCL its top five athletes would have places. The agreement was reemphasised in a joint statement from Marcel Mostert and Paul Ohl in early 2009.\n\nFortissimus regards the ten events that are incorporated in its programme as the Classical Events of strength athletics.\n\n\nFrom 2009 Fortissimus established that the title of the champion would be \"The Strongest Man on Earth\". The winner’s trophy is a bronze statuette of Louis Cyr hoisting the huge 273 ¼ lbs dumbbell that brought him fame on the evening of 19 January 1892 at London’s Royal Aquarium. It was crafted by renowned Canadian sculptor Michel Binette with the original displayed at the Inverness Bronze Museum, in Inverness, Quebec, Canada.\n\n\"Source for the above:\"\n\n\"Source for the above:\"\n\nThis is not the Fortissimus competition title but a recognition of the achievements of a particular strongman over the previous year.\n\n Mariusz Pudzianowski \n\n Zydrunas Savickas\n\nThe Fortissimus Lifetime Achievement Award is given to recognize the greatest strongman athletes in the history of the sport, both past and present athletes are eligible for this title.\n\n Magnus Ver Magnusson\n\nhttp://fitq.co.uk/\n\n"}

Home of First Division side IL Hødd, it is primary used for football, but also features an all-weather running track. The sports complex consists of the main stadium, surrounded by an all-weather running track, a natural grass training pitch and an artificial turf pitch, as well as an indoor hall. Høddvoll has a capacity for 4,433 spectators, of which 2,600 have been seated.\n\nHødd was established in 1919 and completed the construction of Høddvoll in 1921. The original field had gravel and was located at the site of current training pitch. It went through a series of upgrades, becoming a grass field in 1989. The main stadium at Høddvoll opened in 1963, and was followed by five season in the top football league the following decade, resulting in various upgrades. The record attendance is about 12,300, from a 1981 Cup match when Hødd played Vålerenga. The venue saw several upgrades during the 1999, and Hødd play top-league games in 1995. Hødd played a single UEFA Europa League qualifier at Høddvoll in 2013.\n\nAn all-new stadium on the original site is under construction and scheduled for competition in 2014. It will have capacity for 3,825, all except 1,000 seated. It will be built in conjunction with Ulsteinhallen and indoor athletics, handball and gymnastics hall.\n\nHødd was established on 1 August 1919 and the club's first task was to find a suitable location to play football games. As a temporary arrangement, a football field was rented for the inaugural season for NOK 400. The first location which was considered was to purchase land at Holsekerdalen, but a clause in the contract resulted in 15 of 17 members voted against the purchase at a member meeting on 25 September. Instead the club landed on Høddvoll, which was partitioned out of the farm Støylane and approved by the members on 13 February 1920. The main advantage of Høddvoll over Holsekerdalen was that the former allowed for a future expansion of the facilities. The club borrowed 3,000 Norwegian krone (NOK), which was guaranteed by all adult members and some supporters. Construction stated the same year and by March 1921 NOK 8,800 had been invested in the venue. Financing was aided by a grant of NOK 2,000 from the Football Association of Norway (NFF). The venue opened that year, initially with a gravel pitch.\n\nIL Hødd started with athletics in 1925, which were also based at Høddvoll. The first club house opened in 1932, consisting of a shed measuring . The building tipped over in a storm and the locker rooms were thereafter moved to a nearby farmhouse at Støylane. The first upgrade to the pitch was carried out in 1936, in which it was expanded to . The upgrades cost NOK 1,500, of which the state paid NOK 800. Another new gravel surface was laid in 1939. A further expansion took place at the end of the Second World War. When completed in 1947, the field measured . However, the NOK 22,000 investment was a heavy burden on the club's finances. The third club house opened in 1948, costing NOK 3,000. It featured separate locker rooms for each team, in addition to a common shower room.\n\nPlans for a new stadium at Høddvoll were first articulated in 1951, resulting in a visit from NFF the following year to investigate the possibilities. The motion was passed by the club's annual meeting the same year and was included near the schools in the municipal zoning plan which was being revised. Hødd applied for a municipal grant in 1954. This resulted in a political disagreement as to the location of the new venue. The majority in the municipal council wanted the new stadium to be located at Høddvoll, while the minority called for it to be located next to the schools. This would have given a more central placement in town, but the majority was concerned that this would not give sufficient space for future school expansions, as well as giving higher construction costs. The municipality gave a grant of NOK 10,000 towards land purchases, and Hødd paid NOK 26,321 for the necessary land.\n\nConstruction commenced in 1957, but there was very little progress in the work until 1961. The main reasons were the lack of funds and that the contractor went bankrupt. In 1961 there was a boost in the construction, with significant part of the work carried out by volunteers. The pitch was sown by hand in May 1962, but the wet summer caused the grass to not grow properly, and it was never suitable for the season. The pitch was re-sown in the spring of 1963, allowing the new stadium to open on 30 June 1963. Construction cost NOK 200,000, which included a new grandstand. The old clubhouse had become too unmodern and the players instead changed at the community center and were then bused to the stadium.\n\nHødd was promoted to the 1966 Norwegian First Division, which required Høddvoll to be upgraded, mostly by addition additional rows to the grandstand. It also saw the construction of a new club house, which featured three locker rooms, one for each team and for the referees, and a meeting room. Work on a running track for the athletics group commenced in 1971. Lack of funding delayed construction of the NOK 165,000 investment to be placed on hold until 1973. The completed athletics venue was opened in 1975. Planning of the fifth and current club house started in the early 1980s. Financing was secured through a cooperation with location businesses, with Ulstein Hatlø, Ulstein Propeller, Sunnmørsbanken each buying a stake in the investment of NOK 3 million. It was further expanded in the early 1990s with a kindergarten.\n\nThe reserve pitch, the original venue from 1921 which remained a gravel pitch, was upgraded to grass in 1989. It was expanded from to . As part of a cooperation with NFF, Hødd attempted a trial to see how extensive use the field could handle. This resulted in an extensive wear and the pitch was repeatedly closed to allow the grass to heal. Ahead of the 1992 season the stadium received a roof over the grandstand and 600 seats were installed, costing NOK 1.5 million—paid for by the club's sponsors.\n\nThe athletics part of the stadium was not upgraded since 1975 and by the 1990s the section was dilapidated and plans for an all-weather running track and were discussed. This was installed in 1999, along with a new grass turf. This was done simultaneously because the all-weather track required the grass pitch to be moved southwards. While this took place, Hødd's A-team played its First Division matches on the training field. The gravel pitch north of the main stadium was converted to an artificial turf field in 2003, opening on 17 October. In addition to a multiplication of the number of hours it could be used by recreational teams and the secondary school, the field could also be used during winter. An indoor football hall, Ulsmohallen, opened in 2007.\n\nHøddvoll is a multi-sports complex located at the Støylane area of Ulsteinvik, the main village in Ulstein Norway. Høddvoll Stadion has a natural grass pitch with a playing field measuring . It has a seating for 2,600 spectators and 1,733 standing places, giving a combined capacity for 4,433. The stadium is also equipped with an all-weather running track. It is located in the vicinity of Ulstein Upper Secondary School, which also uses the venue during daytime.\nThere are two other pitches at the site, an artificial turf pitch north of the main stadium and a natural grass pitch to the east. The latter, officially named Treningsbane gras 2, measures . North of the training field is the club offices, Høddvollhuset. In addition to locker rooms and club offices, it features a café and event rooms for rental. North of the main stadium and west of the club house is the indoor hall Ulsmohallen. It features a artificial pitch.\n\nHøddvoll has been the home venue of IL Hødd since 1921. The team has played in the top domestic league of Norway for six seasons, in 1966, 1969–72 and 1995. The team has played a combined 60 home games at the top level at Høddvoll, drawing a total of 196,369 spectators, or an average 3273 per match. Hødd's highest home attendance is 5,297 in their inaugural season, and the lowest during play in the top season was 2,133 in 1970. The record attendance of 12,300 dates from a 1981 Cup match when Hødd played Vålerenga.\n\nThe semi-final of the 2012 Norwegian Football Cup was played at Høddvoll, drawing 6,261 spectators, where Hødd won 3–1. After Hødd won the 2012 Cup Final, the team qualified for second qualification round of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League. A major issue was if the club would be allowed to play their games at Høddvoll, or would have to use the more modern stadia Color Line Stadion in Ålesund or Aker Stadion in Molde. UEFA gave Høddvoll a green light in June. Hødd won 1–0 of Aktobe in Høddvoll's only European football match, but lost 1–2 in aggregate. The match sold old, drawing 2,019 spectators.\n\nHøddvoll does not meet the criteria for First Division stadia, lacking such amenities as under-soil heating, floodlights and the necessary standard for locker rooms. The club is therefore working on plans to build an all-new stadium at the site of the training pitch—the site of the first stadium from 1921. The new venue will feature a main stand on the north long side and artificial turf. The project is estimated to cost NOK 50 million. The main stand will feature 1,950 seated places, the opposite, south stand will feature 875 seated places, and the eastern stand will feature standing places for 1,000 spectators, for a total of 3,825. The west end will be built as part of Høddvoll Panorama, which combines commercial estate in the ground floor and eighteen apartments in the upper two stories. The new venue is certified for Norwegian Premier League and UEFA matches. Hødd will rent the stadium from the municipality for NOK 2.5 million per year.\n\nThe main stand will be built in conjunction with Ulsteinhallen, and will feature common locker rooms and cafeteria. The indoor arena will feature a hall area for recreational athletics, handball and gymnastics, with Dimna IL as the main tenant. Both Ulsteinhallen and the new stadium will be owned by Ulstein Eigedomsselskap KF, a municipal enterprise owned by Ulstein Municipality. The municipality estimates that the hall will cost between one and a half and two million kroner per year to operate. Møre og Romsdal County Municipality secured 47.6 percent of the investment costs and 37.6 percent of the operating costs of the new hall, to allow it to be used by Ulstein Upper Secondary School. This will give the school access to of new floor space and daytime access to the athletics hall. Construction commenced in December 2012, with Nord-Berg as the main contractor. The arena is scheduled for completion in 2014, when it will become the third-largest indoor athletics arena in Norway, costing NOK 123 million.\n\n"}

The track is miles in circumference. Its name was changed to \"Laurel Race Course\" for several decades until returning to the \"Laurel Park\" designation in 1994.\n\nLaurel Park Racecourse opened October 2, 1911 under the direction of the Laurel Four County Fair. In 1914, New York businessmen and prominent horsemen, Philip J. Dwyer and James Butler purchased the track and appointed Matt Winn as the general manager. In 1918 the field was used by Army Engineers as a training camp before deployment to France. In 1946, a stable fire broke out with 60 horses saved. In 1947, the Maryland Jockey Club, which owned Timonium and Pimlico, purchased Laurel Park from the Butler estate with the idea of shifting the Pimlico meeting to Laurel. After the Maryland General Assembly rejected the idea of replacing Pimlico with Laurel Park, the track was sold in 1950 to Morris Schapiro who had his youngest son, John D. Schapiro as the track's new president.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1984, Laurel Park underwent a period of great change. The track was renamed Laurel Race Course and the Washington, D.C. International was introduced at miles on the turf. In 1953 Laurel opened a new clubhouse and turf club. In 1954, 14 horses were saved from another stable fire. In 1957 the grandstand was remodeled. In an effort to improve conditions for the International, Laurel lengthened its turf course from seven furlongs to one mile in 1959; simultaneously, the main track was extended from one mile to one mile and one-eighth. In 1964, an intentionally set stable fire destroyed 34 horses. In 1965, the trotting track was covered with an artificial 3M \"Tartan Turf\". Laurel remodeled its clubhouse and grandstand to accommodate winter racing in 1966, enclosing the track’s seating area with 30,000 square feet of half-inch-thick glass. In 1967, another fire was set on two stables which was mitigated by new sprinklers. When Laurel was awarded the summer racing dates in 1982, the track installed an air conditioning system in the grandstand and clubhouse. In 1984, the 34-year Schapiro era ended with the sale of the track.\n\nLaurel entered a new era in December 1984, when governor Harry Hughes's selection for Economic Development secretary Frank J. De Francis and his partners, Robert and John \"Tommy\" Manfuso, purchased the racetrack from Schapiro before racetrack legislation would pose a conflict of interest. Laurel Park Racecourse was updated in 1985 with an innovative creation of the 'Sports Palace'. In August 1989, Frank DeFrancis died and his son, Joe DeFrancis, then served as president of Laurel and Pimlico. In 1994 the track's name returned to \"Laurel Park\". Yet more improvements included those to the main entrance, Grandstand interior and backstretch barns.\n\nIn 1994, an effort to redevelop land occupied by Laurel Park and its adjacent properties was attempted to relocate the Washington Redskins Stadium at the crossroads of Whiskey Bottom Road and Brock Bridge Road. Citizens and clergy launched a successful effort that killed the proposal. A lack of sufficient parking space was a significant factor in the decision.\n\nIn 1999, at Laurel Park, the MJC broke ground on a new $1.85 million backstretch housing project, Laurel Commons, in cooperation with Laurel Quality of Life, Inc., the Enterprise Foundation, Inc. and the Ryan Family Foundation, Inc. In addition, Laurel Park, as part of a $16 million multi-year renovation plan, opened four premier Clubhouse areas: \"Tycoons,\" an upscale cigar and brandy bar with an excellent television presentation of racing and other sporting events; \"Sunny Jim’s,\" a simulcast theater with individual carrels, and food & beverage service; \"Clocker’s Corner,\" a casual simulcast theater and cafe in a convenient track-side location and the \"Kelso Club,\" a premier accommodation for VIP customers with concierge service. Magna Entertainment Corp. purchased the track on July 15, 2002 and announced an alliance with The Maryland Jockey Club designed to raise the level of Maryland thoroughbred racing to new heights. Another renovation of Laurel Park's track and facility in 2004 to early January 2005 widened both racing surfaces.\n\nIn 2013, following a failed attempt to introduce slot machine gambling, Laurel Park owners Stronach Group announced plans to use the Maryland Racetrack Facility Redevelopment Account to fund year-round racing, facility improvements and a tunnel under the adjacent B&O railroad tracks, connecting to a 1000-unit transit-oriented development called Laurel Park Station on the Howard County portion of the Racetrack property.

It is a part of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex and is named after the first modern Olympic marathon gold medalist in 1896, Spyros Louis. The stadium hosts one of the biggest sport clubs in Greece, AEK Athens.\n\nLocated in the area of Marousi in Athens, the stadium was originally designed in 1979 and built in 1980–1982. It was completed in time to host the 1982 European Championships in Athletics. It was inaugurated by the President of Greece at the time, Konstantinos Karamanlis, on 8 September 1982. One year later, in 1983, OAKA Stadium hosted the 1983 European Cup Final between Hamburger SV and Juventus (1-0). In 1987, the stadium hosted the 1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup final between Ajax and Lokomotiv Leipzig (1-0). Olympic stadium is an UEFA category four stadium and is the largest stadium in Grecce. In 1994, OAKA Stadium hosted their second 1994 UEFA Champions League Final, this time contested between AC Milan and Barcelona (4-0). It also hosted several events of the 1991 Mediterranean Games and the 1997 World Championships in Athletics, sought in order to prove that it was capable of hosting major sporting events after the failure of Athens to win the 1996 Summer Olympics but successfully hosting the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\nIt was extensively renovated in time for the 2004 Summer Olympics, including a roof designed by Santiago Calatrava, and innovatively positioned with Enerpac hydraulics. The roof was added atop the sidelines and completed just in time for the opening of the Games. The stadium was then officially re-opened on 30 July 2004. It hosted the athletics events and the football final at the 2004 Summer Olympics. It also hosted the opening ceremony on 13 August 2004, and the closing ceremony on 29 August 2004. In 2007, OAKA Stadium hosted the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final between AC Milan and Liverpool (2-1). The stadium's attendance was reduced to 72,000 for the Olympics, the initial capacity was some 75,000, though only 69,618 seats were made publicly available for the track and field events and slightly more for the football final. The turf system consists of natural grass in modular containers which incorporate irrigation and drainage systems.\n\nThe foundation stone for the Olympic Stadium was laid on 7 January 1980. Its construction was revolutionary and involved the use of a prefabrication method for the 34 sets of pillars supporting the stands (each weighed 600 tons). About 26,000 seats of the lower tier were covered, while the stadium's most striking feature were the four leaning pillars that held its floodlights, each being 62 metres tall. The Athens Olympic Stadium was finally inaugurated in September 1982.\nThe stadium was renovated from 2002 until 2004 adding the famous roof for the 2004 Summer Olympics. The central lawn of O.A.K.A consists of approximately 6.000 plastic capsules inside which thermophile lawn is grown. The capsules are adjoining, their size is 1.2*1.2m and are situated on a flat cement surface of two acres, flanked by two lateral drainage channels. The irrigation of the lawn is achieved by 35 automatically elevated water launchers with the use of programmed irrigation. This system allows the movement of the lawn to an area outside the stadium in order for the surface to be used for different events.Thirty-four entrance gates provide access to the stands. Odd gate numbers (1 to 35) lead to the lower and even numbers (2 to 34) to the upper tier. There are no gates numbered 18 and 36, since the two video-scoreboards are located in their place. Additionally, the stadium features 17 VIP boxes and 3 parking lots. Due to its design, the stadium's tribunes have the ability to empty within 7 minutes.\n\nCompetition Area\nDesigned by the world-known architect Santiago Calatrava the roof costed €130 million. The two giant arcs have a total span of 304m and a maximum height of 72m. The roof has a total weight of 18,700 tons coverering by 5,000 polycarbonate panels which covers an area of 25,000 sq m. The west arc was assembled 72m from its final position and the east 65m - both later slid into place-. The roof is designed to withstand winds up to 120 km/h and earthquakes up to 8 richter scale.\nAccess by:\n\nCar - Exit the city centre to the north via Kifissias Avenue and just follow the roadsigns to \"OAKA\".

The presidential suite includes a kitchenette.\n\nThe outdoor concourses and south side walkway also contain a total of one hundred eight (108) chair-back seats as well as additional space for wheelchair seating. Each side has forty chair-back seats and additional space for wheelchair seating. In addition, the south side walkway includes twenty-eight (28) chair-back seats and wheelchair seating space. The seating sections were added as part of the stadium's complete renovation in 2009 and were part of stadium enhancements made to make the stadium compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n\nThe two story press box, named the \"Dan F. and Sandra A. Smith Press Box\", includes a media center with seating for 32; a TV broadcast booth; two radio broadcast booths; a kitchenette; restrooms; two camera decks; two coaches booths; scoreboard booth; public address booth; and private suites as well as the 25 seat presidential suite discussed above in the \"Additional seating\" section. Press box access is via an elevator located at the rear of the press box and from west side seating.\n\nThe two story Dauphin Athletic Complex, constructed in 2010, is located adjacent to the southern end of the stadium. The 54,000 sq. ft. complex includes an academic center; a 108-seat team auditorium; meeting rooms; locker rooms for both home and visiting teams; and offices for the athletic director, coaches, and other athletic department personnel. Also included is the J. B. Higgins Weight Room with 8,000 sq ft of weight training space, three offices, a storage room, and media room. The university's main athletic training facility, The Beaumont Bone and Joint Institute Sports Medicine Facility, is also located in the complex. It includes a hydrotherapy pool with Hydroworx 1200 treadmill therapy pool, a plunge pool, electrical stimulation and ultrasound units, and a deep-penetrating vibration therapy device. The training facility is one of four on campus training facilities.\n\nMounted on top of the Dauphin Athletic Complex is the Education First Credit Union scoreboard. The scoreboard and video board is mounted in an 88' x 48' outer frame and includes a high definition 51' x 26' Daktronics video board, one of the largest in NCAA Division I FCS football. Another scoreboard is located near the base of the Morgan Suites on the northern end of the stadium.\n\n\nCardinal Stadium, as it was originally known, was completed in 1964 for a cost of $1,000,000. The original stadium capacity was 17,500. The stadium was built as the home of the Lamar Cardinals football team. The football team was disbanded in 1989. Until plans to reinstate the Lamar Cardinal football program were finalized, the stadium hosted some Ozen High School football home games as well as the university soccer team for its first two seasons.\n\nPresidential candidate, Barry Goldwater, spoke before an estimated 15,000-18,000 persons at the stadium on October, 15, 1964.\n\nOn September 19, 1998, the stadium played host to the 1998 Southern vs. Prairie View A&M football game as a \"neutral ground\" location. The game was the final loss of 80 straight losses for the Prairie View program, but is more well known for a halftime brawl between the marching bands of the two schools resulting in a two-game suspension for both bands. Southern won the game 37–7.\n\nIn 2009 the university started renovation on the newly named Provost Umphrey Stadium for the return of football in 2010. Capacity was reduced to 16,000 in the 2010 renovation due to modifications in order to make the stadium ADA compliant. The modifications resulted in the loss of 1,500 seats. Provost Umphrey Stadium renovations and a new adjacent 54,000 sq ft athletic complex, detailed above, were completed for a combined total of $30,000,000. Another component of the stadium renovation included the addition of a new video board\n\nOn November 10, 2008, the stadium became Provost Umphrey Stadium in recognition of a $3 million contribution to Lamar University from the Provost Umphrey law firm and an additional $1 million gift from Walter and Sheila Umphrey.\n\nOn March 19, 2009, alumnus Dan F. Smith donated $6 million to the University, $1 million of which was earmarked for the return of football. In recognition of this gift the press box bears his name. The press box is detailed above in the \"Stadium Features\" section.\n\nOn February 15, 2010 Education First Federal Credit Union donated $1 million to Lamar Athletics. In recognition for their support the 51' by 26' ft digital score board will permanently have Education First FCU displayed.\n\nOn May 6, 2010, the Morgan Charitable Foundation on behalf of Glen and Teri Morgan donated an undisclosed amount of money to build the Morgan Suites on the south east side of the Montagne Center. Seven new suites were built and lease for $25,000 per year with a three-year commitment. The leases include 16 tickets to each home game and parking passes. Revenue from leasing the suites supports football scholarships. Each suite includes a bar with four stools overlooking two tiered rows of 6 seats each, a total of 16 seats. The suites open to the front and feature motorized windows that can be lowered as desired. Each suite includes a small refrigerator and cabinet space. Food and beverage service is available through the university catering vendor at additional charge.\n\nThe largest crowd to see an Lamar Cardinal football game in Provost Umphrey Stadium was 18,500 on September 13, 1980, when the Cardinals hosted Baylor University.\n\nSource:\n\nBelow is a list of the Cardinals best-attended home games (all at Provost Umphrey Stadium).

{"id": "770466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=770466", "title": "Robison Field", "text": "Robison Field\n\nRobison Field is the best-known of several names given to a former Major League Baseball park in St. Louis, Missouri. It was the home of the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League from April 27, 1893 until June 6, 1920.\n\nToday's Cardinals of the National League began in 1882, as the St. Louis Browns of the then-major American Association. They won four championships during the Association's ten-year existence of 1882 through 1891. During that decade, the team was playing their home games at Sportsman's Park, at the corner of Grand and Dodier. In 1892, four of the Association clubs were absorbed into the National League, and the Association folded. Sportsman's Park remained the home of the Browns during their first NL season.\n\nAlthough the Browns had been the most successful of the Association clubs, they fell on hard times for some years after the merger. For 1893, owner Chris von der Ahe moved his team a few blocks to the northwest and opened a \"New\" Sportsman's Park, on the southeast corner of Natural Bridge and Vandeventer. The move to this particular site was part of a \"deal\", as the property had been owned by a trolley company, who then ran a trolley line out near the ballpark. The diamond was in the northwest corner of the block. Prairie Avenue was the east (left field) border. Right field, the shorter of the outfields, was bordered by Lexington Avenue.\n\nThe ballpark was generations ahead of its time in some ways. Along with the basic stands, Von der Ahe had built an adjoining amusement park, a beer garden, a race track in the outfield, a \"shoot-the-shoots\" water flume ride, and an artificial lake (used for ice skating in winter). The side show notwithstanding, the club performed poorly on the field for most of the 1890s, consistently finishing at or near last place in the 12-team league as Von der Ahe sold off his best players in order to keep the club solvent.\n\nOn April 16, 1898, a fire ignited by a dropped and still-burning cigar consumed the grandstands and other structures. A heroic overnight effort was made to construct some temporary seating, and the game scheduled for the 17th was played. Von der Ahe was able to secure financing to rebuild the permanent stands, albeit in a much more modest design than before. But this was the last step in the decline of his once-proud franchise. \n\nIn 1899, Von der Ahe sold the Browns to Frank and Stanley Robison. By then the ballpark was no longer the \"New\" Sportsman's Park. During the Robison's tenure, the venue was simply called League Park. It would bear that name through the 1910 season.\n\nThe Robison brothers sought to change the image and reverse the fortunes of their team. They dropped the old \"Browns\" identity, abandoning that team color and switching to Cardinal red. This would yield a new and lasting nickname. However, for 1899 they are known to historians as the \"Perfectos\".\n\nThe Robisons had previously owned the Cleveland Spiders, and in fact still owned them as the 1899 season began (a situation that would not be allowed today). They stripped Cleveland of its best players, including Cy Young, and sent them to St. Louis. If this made the St. Louis club the \"Perfectos\", it also unfortunately made the Cleveland club the \"Wanderers\", as they became known when they were forced to play most of that season (their last) on the road. Despite loading up their roster, the previously cellar-dwelling St. Louis club was only able to improve to fifth place.\n\nCleveland and three other clubs were contracted after the 1899 season. The Cardinals began the 1900 season with less competition, but sank back toward the cellar again. The only thing that kept the baseball situation in balance was that the new Browns of the American League generally fared equally poorly in the pennant races.\n\nThe wooden ballpark continued to be plagued by fire. On May 4, 1901, a fire began under the main part of the stands, and as with the 1898 fire, the structure was consumed within half an hour. During the rebuilding process, the Robison brothers arranged with the management of Athletic Park (as the \"old\" Sportsman's Park was being called by then) to play there until yet another wooden stand could be built. However, after playing on the 5th, they went on a month-long road trip, and returned to a newly-rebuilt League Park on June 3.\n\nIn its final form, the park was typical for its era: a wooden structure, with a covered grandstand behind home plate and extending to first and third base; open bleachers extending to the left field corner; bleachers in parts of the outfield; and a covered pavilion from first base to the right field corner.\n\nHelene Britton, daughter of Frank Robison, inherited the Cardinals team and the ballpark from her uncle Stanley upon his death in 1911. Helene renamed the ballpark Robison Field as a memorial to her father (who had died in 1908) and her uncle. She held the club for next few seasons, until selling her interest in the team in 1917 to a group that included Sam Breadon.\n\nWith the Robison family no longer associated with the team, the park was often called simply Cardinal Field in its final years. Breadon attained majority ownership in 1920 and decided that the nearly three-decades-old wooden ballpark was no longer adequate.\n\nIn mid-season 1920 the Cardinals abandoned this ballpark and moved back to Sportsman's Park, making their debut there on June 6. The park had been rebuilt, owned and occupied by the American League version of the Browns since 1902. The \"Old\" Sportsman's Park would outlive the \"New\" by some four decades.\n\nRobison Field was the last remaining major league ballpark that was primarily wooden. The park site continued to be owned by the Cardinals for a few more years. They finally sold the property to the developers of Beaumont High School, which was built on the site and was opened in 1926. After their constant on-field struggles at the old park, the club had begun to improve after their move, and with some fresh cash, they were ready to taste success. 1926 would also be the year of the Cardinals' first modern league and World Series championship.\n\nBeaumont High School produced a number of major league ballplayers. Its own life cycle ended in the spring of 2014, when it closed.\n\n\n"}

It is held at the Limerick Lawn Tennis Club in Limerick, County Limerick, Ireland. The championships is Worlds Second Oldest surviving tennis tournament after Wimbledon but the only event to have been staged continuously for the last 141 years.\n\nLimerick Lawn Tennis Club was first established in 1877 in Limerick, County Limerick, Ireland. The same year the club staged the first Open Championships in Ireland in August 1877 one month after the Wimbledon Championships were inaugurated, the results of that tournament were however not recorded. It was not until 1879 that the first Irish Lawn Tennis Championships were staged at the Fitzwilliam Tennis Club in Dublin.\nIn 1878 the first \"South of Ireland Championships\" also known as the \"Limerick Cup\" were founded the men's event was won by Veere St Leger Goold. The event featured both men's and women's singles and doubles competitions and was the first notable tournament in Great Britain and Ireland to feature a woman's competition seven years before the Wimbledon Championships followed suit. In 1881 the reigning Wimbledon Champion William Renshaw and his twin brother Ernest Renshaw entered the doubles competition. Between 1884 and 1885 no women's event were staged. The 1885 and 1886 editions were won by future Wimbledon Champion Willoughby Hamilton. \n\nBetween 1911 and 1912 the championships were won by Irishman Frank Cosbie. With the advent of World War One the championships were still held from 1914 and 1919. Post war the championships were won again by Irish Lawn Tennis Championships finalist Frank Cosbie three times consecutively 1924 to 1926. The tournament was still staged during World War Two from 1939 to 1945. Post war the 1953 championships were won by American player Ellis Williamson. In 1975 the men's championships were won Michael.

Into the Open Era it did not survive as a tour tournament on the lucrative Grand Prix tennis circuit but did remain a fixture on the International Tennis Federation circuit for a short while until the mid-1990's. The tournament was downgraded again to regional status and continues to operate within the annual tennis tournament circuit of Tennis Ireland. The championships were staged in June 2018 which was the 141st edition of this tournament it was won by James Halas.\n\nNotes: Challenge Round: The Final round of a tournament, in which the winner of a single-elimination phase faces the previous year's champion, who plays only that one match.

Dean voices these dreams to his father, but receives negative feedback, and it is not until his brother, Kelly convinces their father Blane to let him try that he is granted the chance to travel to Canada to try out for the Hamilton Mustangs. At the try-outs, Youngblood demonstrates the abilities which garnered him \"92 goals in the New York League\" but also displays a lack of physical toughness that is so prized in Canadian junior hockey. This perceived weakness is pounced upon by a brutish player, Carl Racki, who is also trying out for the team and engages him in a fight. Youngblood quickly learns that flashiness and pure athletic ability will not be enough to be successful in this league. Despite being one-punched by Racki, Mustangs head coach Murray Chadwick, a former NHL All-Star with the New York Rangers, opts to select Youngblood for a spot on the team. He ingratiates himself to the other players through a hazing ritual in which members of the Mustangs pin Youngblood down, and Captain Derek Sutton shaves his testicles. Youngblood meets the coach's daughter Jessie after this incident, and despite his embarrassment, an early attraction is felt.\n\nAfter his mentor and friend on the team, Derek Sutton, is brutally injured by Racki (now with a rival team), Youngblood returns home to the farm. After a pep-talk by Kelly about the nature of never quitting, Youngblood is inspired to learn how to survive on the ice. Dean's father Blane, who initially disapproved of his son playing, especially after Kelly had been injured ending a promising career, also teaches his son some fighting tricks, stating \"You can learn to punch in the barn, but you've got to learn to survive on the ice\". Youngblood returns to the team, ready to confront Racki in the final game of the Memorial Cup playoffs.\n\nThe game ends with a dramatic, game-winning goal by Youngblood with 3 seconds left. Youngblood demands to be left in the game as time expires to confront Racki. Youngblood emerges victorious, landing several blows to the face and body of his nemesis Racki, and is carried off the ice on the shoulders of his teammates.\n\n\nMany of the other team members in the film were actual junior or NCAA hockey players, including Steve Thomas, Peter Zezel (both of whom had lengthy NHL careers), Don Biggs, and James Richmond.\n\nThe movie gained a mediocre reception, with critics finding the plot derivative. However, it became a popular VHS video rental and cable TV showing.\n\nThe filming of \"Youngblood\" took place in the east end of Toronto in the summer of 1984. Ted Reeve Arena was used as the setting for the interior of the Hamilton Mustangs home rink while Scarborough Gardens Arena was used for the setting of the arena's exterior; a third city arena was also used for filming.\n\nSeveral of the cast and crew had actual hockey experience and skills, though star Rob Lowe had to learn to skate, and both he and Patrick Swayze, a better skater, used doubles for many of their on-ice skating scenes. Director and writer Peter Markle was a former minor-pro and international player for the USA. Cinematographer Mark Irwin, a Canadian, wore skates and a helmet and devised a special rig for shooting hockey scenes on the ice. The film's hockey consultant Eric Nesterenko was a two decade NHL veteran who also appeared as the father of the film's lead character. Keanu Reeves played goalie growing up and in high school. George Finn, who played villain Carl Racki, was a former OHL enforcer. Many of the other team members were actual NCAA or junior hockey players, some of whom went on to significant NHL careers.\n\nLowe later said he \"hated\" learning how to skate. \"I don't like any sport where you're already exhausted when you're done putting on the equipment. But that said, once I got the equipment on and was out on the ice, I loved that. I loved hitting people, being hit, skating. I love the exertion and competition, so that was all great. But it's a lot of work putting all of that shit on! Give me a surfboard and let me just paddle into the ocean.\"\n\n\n"}
