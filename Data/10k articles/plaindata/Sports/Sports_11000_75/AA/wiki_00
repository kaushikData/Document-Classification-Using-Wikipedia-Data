The scandal resulted in the resignation of England national football team manager Sam Allardyce after only one game in charge, as well as the sacking or suspension of numerous English Football League club staff, including Barnsley assistant manager Tommy Wright.\n\nOn 26 September, \"The Daily Telegraph\" published footage filmed by undercover reporters in which then England manager Sam Allardyce is shown speaking with fictitious Asian businessmen, detailing how to get around FIFA and Football Association bans on third-party ownership of football players, before making derogatory comments about former England assistant manager Gary Neville and previous England manager Roy Hodgson. Allardyce subsequently spoke about HM Revenue and Customs, calling them the \"most corrupt business in the world\", Allardyce himself having been caught up in alleged tax fraud schemes in the past.\n\nFollowing the revelations by \"The Daily Telegraph\", the FA and Allardyce agreed on 27 September for him to resign as England manager with immediate effect by mutual consent, with Gareth Southgate being named as caretaker manager. Following Allardyce's departure, \"The Daily Telegraph\" published further details of much wider-reaching corruption through English club football, claiming that eight Premier League managers accepted \"bungs\" for player transfers.\n\nOn 27 September, \"The Daily Telegraph\" revealed that the Barnsley assistant manager Tommy Wright had taken a £5000 \"bung\" in order to arrange for the club to purchase part-owned players from a fictitious Far East firm. He was initially suspended by Barnsley as they launched an investigation into the allegations; he was sacked on 28 September.\n\nOn 28 September, it was claimed by \"The Daily Telegraph\" that Queens Park Rangers manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink had agreed to become an ambassador for a fictitious Far East sports company involved in third-party ownership of players in exchange for £55,000, subsequently also discussing potential tax avoidance involving his bank account in the Netherlands. Hasselbaink denied the claim, although he admitted he had been naive, and was supported by Queens Park Rangers after their internal investigation.\n\nLeeds United chairman Massimo Cellino was shown on video agreeing to sell 20% of the club in order to work around third-party player ownership rules.\n\nOn 29 September, \"The Daily Telegraph\" released further footage from their investigation, alleging to show the assistant manager of Southampton, Eric Black, advising fictitious businessmen on how to bribe lower league clubs. Additionally, Jimmy Houtput, chairman of Belgian First Division B club Oud-Heverlee Leuven, allegedly offered his club as a \"conduit\" in order to aid third-party companies in gaining ownership of football players in England. Houtput resigned as OH Leuven chairman the following day.\n\nWales manager Chris Coleman commented that corruption in the football industry should be punished by lifetime bans for the perpetrators.\n\nFormer player and pundit Alan Shearer was particularly critical, claiming he \"didn't think England could stoop any lower\" following the England team's 1–2 loss to Iceland during UEFA Euro 2016 three months earlier, and called the team \"a laughing stock of world football\".\n\n"}

{"id": "4176707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4176707", "title": "Abu Daoud", "text": "Abu Daoud\n\nMohammad Daoud Oudeh (), commonly known by his nom de guerre Abu Daoud or Abu Dawud () 1937, – 3 July 2010) was a Palestinian known as the planner, architect and mastermind of the Munich massacre. He served in a number of commanding functions in Fatah's armed units in Lebanon and Jordan.\n\nOudeh was born in Silwan, East Jerusalem, in 1937. He was a teacher by training. He taught physics and maths in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Then he worked at the justice ministry of Kuwait and studied law. He lived in Jerusalem until the 1967 Six-Day War, when he was displaced as Israel recaptured the eastern portion of the city; he resettled in Jordan, where he joined the PLO. In 1970, Abu Daoud was one of the founders of Fatah. From 1971, he was leader of the Black September, a Fatah offshoot created to avenge the September 1970 expulsion of the Fedayeen Movement from Jordan and carry out international operations. The group gained international notoriety for its role in the Munich massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics, in which a number of athletes on the Israeli team were taken hostage by Black September. Eleven Israeli athletes and a German policeman were killed by the end of the multi-day standoff.\n\nAfter the Black September operations, Oudeh began to live in Eastern Europe and Lebanon. He resumed his activity in Fatah and the PLO in close collaboration with Abu Iyad and other officials. He led armed units in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War. In January 1977, Oudeh was intercepted by French police in Paris while travelling from Beirut under an assumed name. Under protest from the PLO, Iraq, and Libya, who claimed that because Oudeh was traveling to a PLO comrade's funeral he should receive diplomatic immunity, the French government refused a West German extradition request on grounds that forms had not been filled in properly and put him on a plane to Algeria before Germany could submit another request. Oudeh fled to Eastern Europe, then to Lebanon until the 1975 Lebanese Civil War broke out, then back to Jordan.\n\nOn 1 August 1981, Oudeh was shot five times from a distance of around two meters in the coffee shop of the Victoria Inter-Continental Hotel in Warsaw, but he survived the attack, chasing his would-be assassin down to the front entrance before collapsing. Oudeh claimed the attempted assassination was carried out by a Palestinian double agent recruited by the Mossad, and claimed the would-be assassin was executed by the PLO ten years later.\n\nAfter the 1993 Oslo Accords, he moved to Ramallah in the West Bank. Following a trip to Jordan and the publication of his memoirs, Oudeh was banned from returning to Ramallah. He settled with his family in Syria, the only country that would take him. He lived on a pension provided by the Palestinian Authority and gave interviews to Aljazeera and other Arab and international media outlets about his life, the Munich events, and Palestinian politics. Oudeh was allowed safe passage through Israel in 1996, so he could attend a PLO meeting in the Gaza Strip to rescind an article in the PLO charter calling for Israel's eradication.\n\nAs a commander of Black September, Abu Daoud was the mastermind behind the Munich massacre. He planned the operation in July 1972, briefed the execution cell on the specifics of the operation, and accompanied the members of the execution cell to the Olympic Village by taxi on the night/early morning of the attack. It was on the evening of 4 September 1972, the day before the operation commenced in the early morning of 5 September 1972, that Abu Daoud briefed the assassination squad and issued final instructions over dinner in a restaurant at the Munich railway station.\n\nThen in 2006, Abu Daoud gave several personal interviews after the release of the Steven Spielberg film \"Munich\" revived discussions of the massacre. Abu Daoud remained unrepentant regarding his role in the Munich attacks, stating on Germany's \"Spiegel TV\", \"I regret nothing. You can only dream that I would apologize.\" In an Associated Press interview, he justified the operation by claiming it was a strategic success, declaring, \"Before Munich, we were simply terrorists. After Munich, at least people started asking who are these terrorists? What do they want? Before Munich, nobody had the slightest idea about Palestine.\"\n\nHe published his autobiography \"Palestine: From Jerusalem to Munich\" in French in 1999. It was later published in English as \"Memoirs of a Palestinian Terrorist\", also titled \"Palestine-A History of the Resistance Movement, by the Sole Survivor of Black September\" by Arcade Publishing in hardcover format. The English version is now out of print. The book is a first hand account of the rise of the Palestinian resistance movement from its inception to the attack at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Regarding the book and his subsequently being barred from returning to the West Bank, \"The Israeli decision to bar my return is linked to an event which happened 27 years ago, the Munich operation, which we considered a legitimate struggle against the enemy we (the PLO) were fighting.\"\n\nIn 1999, the Palestinian Prize for Culture was granted to Abu Daoud for his book \"Palestine: From Jerusalem to Munich\", in which he describes how he planned and executed the Munich operation. As part of the prize, Abu Daoud was awarded 10,000 French francs.\n\nOn 3 July 2010, Daoud died of kidney failure at Al-Andalus Hospital in Damascus, Syria. After a funeral service in the Al Wasim Mosque in Yarmouk with his coffin draped in the Palestinian flag, he was buried in the Martyrs Cemetery of the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp on the southern outskirts of Damascus. He was survived by his wife, five daughters and a son. His daughter Hana Oudeh, in the eulogy, said her father was \"a great loving and sincere man whose dream was to go back to Palestine.\" Representatives of various Palestinian groups, including Fatah and Islamic Jihad, attended the funeral. Shortly before his death, Oudeh said in a statement to Israelis, \"Today, I cannot fight you anymore, but my grandson will and his grandsons too.\"\n\nIn a condolence letter to Abu Daoud's family following his death, Chairman of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas wrote, \"He is missed. He was one of the leading figures of Fatah and spent his life in resistance and sincere work as well as physical sacrifice for his people's just causes.\"\n\n"}

Created by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jim Lorimer, it is an offshoot of the Arnold Sports Festival which takes place annually in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Instead of focusing on endurance, speed and athleticism like the World's Strongest Man, the competition is geared toward the heaviest instruments in the world to find out who truly is the strongest man.\n\nThe Arnold Strongman (which has been variously referred to as the \"Arnold Classic\", the \"Arnold Classic Strongman\", \"Arnold's Summit\" and \"Arnold's Strongest Man\") is one of the many offshoots of the Arnold festival. The Arnold Sports Festival, founded in 1989 as the Arnold Classic and named after Arnold Schwarzenegger, was originally a bodybuilding contest. It featured a competition for men (Arnold Classic) and for women (Ms. International). The bodybuilding contests have since expanded to include a Fitness International and Figure International competition for women. However, the event had also expanded to include other sports and events, one of which was a strongman, introduced in late 2002. This Strongman event was created by a powerlifter named Dr. Terry Todd at the request of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The expansion of the programme led to the Classic becoming the Arnold Fitness Weekend and now the Arnold Sports Festival. According to the Arnold Sports Festival co-producer, Jim Lorimer: \"The Arnold Strongman Classic has been growing in popularity every year, and we are very excited that many strong men are returning.\" January 29, 2008\n\nIn 2002 the American professional wrestler and former weight lifter Mark Henry won the competition. In addition to competing in what were the four official events — the Apollon's Wheel, the deadlift, the Hummer push and the 800+lbs Farmer's Walk — the competitors were given the opportunity to attempt to lift the Thomas Inch \"unliftable\" dumbbell, or \"Inch Bell\". A prize of $1000 was awarded to the man who could pull it the highest in the air. Five men chose to try the Bell with Mark Henry winning the $1000 by pulling it to the level of his chest. Pfister raised the Inch Bell over his head with his right hand, to a standing ovation, but his lift was disqualified because he briefly stabilised the dumbbell with his left hand when it was on his knee and because he used a \"continental clean\" when raising the dumbbell to his chest. Pfister was however also awarded $1000.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2008 the Arnold Strongman was won every year by Žydrūnas Savickas of Lithuania (see Full results below). In 2008 he received a $40,000 check from Gerard Dente of MHP, an Audemars Piguet watch by Robert Ronan and the Louis Cyr trophy (after the legendary strongman, Louis Cyr) and congratulations from Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the competition 12 world records were set with Savickas setting three of them. In the Tire Deadlift he lifted 1,027 lbs. In the Circus Dumbbell he tied with Derek Poundstone for the world record with nine lifts each, and in the Manhood Stones he lifted 525 lbs, three times.\n\nAmerican Derek Poundstone won in 2009 & 2010. Derek took the vacant throne from Zydrunas when he took 2009 off from the competition. When Savickas returned in 2010, Derek retained his title by defeating Zydrunas.\n\nJust days before the 2011 contest, 2 time defending champion Derek Poundstone was forced to withdraw from the contest due to injury. Brian Shaw came in and won the contest, and Mike Jenkins, the winner of the 2010 Arnold Strongman amateur event who was competing in his first ever professional strongman competition, shocked many and finished in second place ahead of 6 time champion Zydrunas Savickas who came in third.\n\nTotal Wins\n\n\nDates: 22, 23 February 2002\n\nColumbus, Ohio:\nDates: 28 February, 1 March 2003\n\nColumbus, Ohio:\nDates: 5, 6 March 2004\n\nColumbus, Ohio:\nDates: 4, 5 March 2005\n\nColumbus, Ohio:\nDates: 3, 4 March 2006\n\nColumbus, Ohio:\nDates: 2–4 March 2007\n\nColumbus, Ohio:\nDates: 29 February, 1 March 2008\n\nColumbus, Ohio:\nDates: 6, 7 March 2009\n\nColumbus, Ohio:\nDates: 5, 6 March 2010\n\nColumbus, Ohio (Greater Columbus Convention Center, Arnold EXPO Stage)\nDates: 4, 5 March 2011\n\nColumbus, Ohio (Greater Columbus Convention Center, Arnold EXPO Stage)\nDates: 2, 3 March 2012\n\nColumbus, Ohio (Greater Columbus Convention Center, Arnold EXPO Stage)\nDates: 1, 2 March 2013\n\nColumbus, Ohio (Greater Columbus Convention Center, Arnold EXPO Stage)\nDates: 1, 2 March 2014\n\nColumbus, Ohio (Greater Columbus Convention Center, Arnold EXPO Stage)\nDates: 7, 8 March 2015\n\nColumbus, Ohio (Greater Columbus Convention Center, Arnold EXPO Stage)\nDates: 4, 5 March 2016\n\nColumbus, Ohio (Greater Columbus Convention Center, Arnold EXPO Stage)\n\nIn 2012, the inaugural \"Arnold Strongman Classic-Europe\" contest was formed, and is a joint promotion between Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Lorimer (Arnold Sports Festival co-promoter), Dr. Rafael Santonja (president of the International Federation of Body Building, \"IFBB\") as well as American Strongman Corporation and Strongman Champions League.\n\nThe \"Arnold Strongman Classic-Europe\" contest will differ significantly from the format of the original Arnold Strongman Classic event, with less of an emphasis on brute strength and heavy events, and will include a wider variety of events and some speed/loading events similar to Strongman Champions League and World's Strongest Man contests. The format change is due largely in part to the event being broadcast and televised in 85 countries.\n\nThe 2012 contest was held in Madrid, Spain on Oct. 13 & 14, 2012, the event was sponsored by MHP. The contest is included as part of the 2012 Strongman Champions League season, and competitors earned points towards the annual SCL overall title.

Professional camel racing, like horse racing, is an event for betting and tourist attraction. Camels can run at speeds up to 65 km/h (18 m/s; 40 mph) in short sprints and they can maintain a speed of 40 km/h (11 m/s; 25 mph) for an hour.\nCamels are often controlled by child jockeys, but allegations of human rights abuses have led to nationwide bans on underage labor in the UAE and Qatar. In modern camel racing, camels are often controlled by remote controlled robotic whips.\n\nA major camel race is the Camel Cup held at Alice Springs which is the second biggest prize purse camel race in Australia. It is held annually and includes not only the camel races themselves, but also a collection of market stalls and other entertainment.\n\nThe biggest prize money camel race in Australia is \"The Boulia desert Sands\" with a A$25,000 prize purse in Queensland.\n\nChildren are often favored as jockeys because of their light weight. It has been reported that thousands of children (some reported as young as 2 years old) are trafficked from countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Pakistan,India and Sudan for use as jockeys for camel racing industry in Arab States of the Persian Gulf. Estimates range of 5,000 – 40,000 child camel jockeys in the Persian Gulf region.\n\nMany child camel jockeys are seriously injured by falling off the camels. The child jockeys live in camps (called \"ousbah\") near the racetracks and many are victims of abuse. Hundreds of children have been rescued from camel farms in Oman, Qatar, and UAE and taken back to their original homes or kept in shelter homes. Many however, are unable to identify their parents or home communities in South Asia or Sudan. Some countries have issued penalties for those who trafficked child camel jockeys and ordered the owners responsibilities for returning the children back to their home countries. However, they report that in many instances the children rescued were those who had been sold away by their own parents in exchange for money or a job abroad. If they were returned, the children would again be sold for the same purposes. Other children did not speak their native languages, or did not know how to live outside the camel farms.\n\nA prominent activist for rehabilitation and recovery of the jockeys is Pakistani lawyer Ansar Burney. He has focused a portion of his work on eliminating the use of child jockeys.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates was the first to ban the use of children under 15 as jockeys in camel racing when Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan announced the ban on 29 July 2002. In 2009 the UAE paid compensation to 879 former jockeys. The UAE now issues penalties such as jail and banning for those found using children as jockeys. In 2010, volunteers from Anti-Slavery International photographed violations of this ban.\n\nIn Qatar, the Emir of Qatar, Hamad Al Thani, banned child jockeys in 2005 and directed that, by 2007, all camel races would be directed by robotic jockeys.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18948470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18948470", "title": "Carrom ball", "text": "Carrom ball\n\nThe carrom ball (also known as the sodukku ball in parts of India) is a style of spin bowling delivery used in cricket. The ball is released by flicking it between the thumb and a bent middle finger in order to impart spin. Though the delivery was first brought in use in early 1940s, it was re-introduced by Ajantha Mendis in 2008 as well as by Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin later.\nThe first bowler known to have used this style of delivery was the Australian Jack Iverson from Victoria, who used it throughout his Test cricket career in the period after the Second World War, although he did not use the name \"carrom ball\". Fellow countryman John Gleeson used a similar grip a decade later, but by the end of the 1970s the method was almost forgotten. It has since re-entered cricketing consciousness because of its use by Ajantha Mendis of Sri Lanka, with the new name of carrom ball. Mendis unveiled this delivery during the 2008 Asia Cup. Ravichandran Ashwin calls his variation the 'sodukku ball'. In the Tamil language, sodukku means \"snapping of fingers\". This is reflected in the way the ball is delivered, by a \"snap\" of the middle finger and the thumb. Ashwin says that he first learned to bowl this type of delivery playing street cricket in Chennai, while using a tennis ball, and later in his childhood he perfected the delivery with a real cricket ball. He took nine wickets in his debut Test against the West Indies in November 2011 and used the carrom ball to dismiss Marlon Samuels in the second innings. New Zealander Mitchell Santner is believed to be the first left handed spin bowler to have used the method in international cricket, dismissing Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman with a delivery in the carrom ball style during a one-day international match on January 16, 2018 .\nThe ball is held between the thumb, forefinger and the middle finger and, instead of a conventional release, the ball is squeezed out and flicked by the fingers like a carrom player flicking the disc on a carrom board. It is different from wrist-bowled deliveries. Traditional leg-spin is bowled with anti-clockwise wrist movement for a right-armed bowler, while Muttiah Muralitharan's special type of off-spin is bowled with clockwise wrist movement. A finger-bowled delivery such as traditional off-spin is bowled with a clockwise finger movement. Carrom spin can be considered a third category of spin bowling after leg spin and off spin, as the middle finger and thumb flick or squeeze the ball out of the hand, like a carrom player flicking a striker in the indoor game of carrom. When the centre finger is gripped towards the leg side, the ball spins from leg to off; when the centre finger is gripped towards the off side, the ball spins from off to leg. Depending on the degree the ball is gripped towards the leg side, the carrom ball could also travel straight. The carrom ball can therefore spin to either the off or leg sides or travel straight (as opposed to the popular misconception that it only spins towards the off side).\n\n"}

The Sembawang Dockyard history also gives little mention of the years it was a Royal Naval Dockyard.\n\nThe club houses a bar where patrons can enjoy the seaview.

{"id": "2283142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2283142", "title": "Clipper Magazine Stadium", "text": "Clipper Magazine Stadium\n\nClipper Magazine Stadium is a 6,000-seat baseball park in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Its first regular season baseball game occurred on May 11, 2005, in which the Lancaster Barnstormers lost to the Atlantic City Surf, 4-3. The ballpark also hosts the New Era Tournament for midget baseball and the Lancaster-Lebanon League high school baseball championship, and was the site of the 2008 Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference baseball championship. In October 2008, the venue hosted vice-presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, for the\nRoad to Victory rally during the 2008 United States presidential election. Clipper Magazine Stadium was honored as the \"Ballpark of the Year\" by the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball following the end of its 2013 regular season. The award commemorated Barnstormers' staff for their excellence in groundskeeping and stadium operations.\n\nClipper Magazine Stadium also serves as the corporate headquarters for the Atlantic League. The ballpark is named for Clipper Magazine, a local periodical company, which purchased the naming rights for $2.5 million over ten years. This agreement was extended in 2013 through the 2019 season.\n\n44 years before the opening of Clipper Magazine Stadium and the Lancaster Barnstormers' inaugural season, the Lancaster Red Roses entertained baseball enthusiasts for 20 years at Stumpf Field. Efforts for a new stadium and a new team began in 1987, and what was a long sixteen-year battle finally paid off with an announcement in 2003. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania agreed to fund roughly half of the cost with Opening Day Partners and the city of Lancaster covering the remainder. The original plan in 2001 called for a proposed, $20-million ballpark to be constructed on the Diseley Farm site, across from Long's Park in Manheim Township. However, those plans were cancelled because of residential concerns about traffic and political concerns about the use of eminent domain and rezoning. After this plan was terminated, most Lancaster County politicians preferred a downtown ballpark in order to revitalize a run-down neighborhood. The Redevelopment Authority of the County of Lancaster settled on an industrial site on the corner of North Prince and Frederick streets, where a company called Ace Rents existed. Initially, Ace Rents stalled the process, but quickly came to an agreement as they did not want to cause delay. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 28, 2004, and Clipper Magazine Stadium was finished just before it opened on May 11, 2005.\n\nWith its brick façade and steel beams, the architecture of Clipper Magazine Stadium alludes to its industrial surroundings. Located in Lancaster's Northwest Corridor, the ballpark faces many downtown factories and is itself constructed over a former rail yard. Coincidentally, this section of Lancaster city (between North Mary and North Charlotte Streets, south of the Harrisburg Pike) was historically known as the \"base ball ground\", circa 1886.\n\nIn July 2007, the Lancaster Barnstormers hosted the Atlantic League All-Star Game at Clipper Magazine Stadium. The league's former North Division won, 8-6.\n\nClipper Magazine Stadium includes 6,000 green, chair-back seats in two levels divided by an open, 360° concourse. It also features other seating options such as luxury suites with professional catering, lawn seating that expands the ballpark's seating capacity to 7,500, and bleachers along the left-field wall. Additionally, the venue has three entertainment venues for children: the Weis Horse Around Corral featuring a carousel, jungle gyms, a rock climbing wall, and various inflatables; Cylo's Clubhouse that allows for youth to interact with the Barnstormers' bovine mascot, Cylo; and the Turkey Hill Birthday Zone that hosts birthday celebrations. The Inside Corner Team Store is the official Lancaster Barnstormers' team apparel and souvenir store. It is located at the home-plate entrance and open year-round. Aside from the entertainment options, the venue depicts Lancaster's professional baseball history with a visual display, to include a mural honoring Richard M. Scott. Scott was a former Lancaster mayor (1974–1979) who initiated the civic effort toward Clipper Magazine Stadium.\n\nOne of the ballpark's highlights is Hess’ Picnic Pavilion, a concession stand with a red barn façade that includes a traditional ballpark menu with an emphasis on items produced in Lancaster County. This emphasis includes Hess’s BBQ (a four-time Pennsylvania state barbecue champion), Auntie Anne's soft pretzels, Kunzler hot dogs, beer from the Lancaster Brewing Company, and Turkey Hill ice cream and iced tea. Other regional foods provided at Clipper Magazine Stadium include cheesesteaks and whoopie pies.\n\nBefore the 2013 Atlantic League season, the Lancaster Barnstormers made a series of improvements to Clipper Magazine Stadium. The first of these was a new playground for children along the third-base line featuring a foam-based protective floor. Other improvements included a renovated picnic area with new tents and a deck comprising synthetic materials instead of wood, a new right-field wall, landscaping beyond the outfield, and computerized irrigation controls.\n\nPrior to the 2008 season, a unique feature was added to Clipper Magazine Stadium: Home Run Harbor, a 36,000-gallon, artificial pond with 10 bumper boats equipped with water cannons, a small waterfall, and a bridge. An estimated 30% of the home runs at the ballpark are hit toward the Home Run Harbor area, making the location a great place to see long-ball action. Safety netting prevented incoming baseballs from injuring patrons of the attraction. The bumper boats attraction was closed after the 2015 season.\n\nThe Lancaster Barnstormers added the Silverball Museum Arcade in time for the 2011 Atlantic League season. It is a coin-free attraction that includes nostalgic arcade games from the 1930s to some of the video games played in the present. Each machine possesses a description of its history and inspiration. The Silverball Museum Arcade also has televisions and multimedia detailing everything pinball.\n\nIn late 2012, an artist named Derek Parker installed his baseball stitches sculpture along Clipper Magazine Stadium's main walkway on North Prince Street. It symbollically links the ballpark to Lancaster city. As the sixth Poetry Paths project completed by Franklin & Marshall College's Writer's House, the stitches also tie professional baseball and the arts. It includes the Le Hinton poem called \"Our Ballpark\" and is part of a $250,000 initiative by the Lancaster County Community Foundation to add art and poetry into Lancaster city's urban environment.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2010, Clipper Magazine Stadium hosted its first celebration, \"3…2…1! Lancaster.\" The event was coordinated with a concert, fireworks, and the Red Rose drop at nearby Binns Park.\n\nClipper Magazine Stadium is converted to an outdoor public ice-skating rink during the winter months so the Lancaster community can enjoy the ballpark in the off-season. Using state-of-the art equipment, the right field segment of the ballpark is converted to an ice skating rink measuring 135 feet by 85 feet with skate rental available; the concessions serve ballpark fare as well as soup, coffee, and hot chocolate. In 2010, a 26-foot Ice Slide attraction by Avalanche Express was added to the Ice Park.\n\nIn 2012, the Barnstormers held its first annual celebrity softball game, which was hosted by LeSean McCoy, an All-Pro running back on the Philadelphia Eagles and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania native. The contest pits the Eagles against professional football players from other teams in the National Football League. The 2012 Eagles roster featured Brent Celek, Hugh Douglas, DeSean Jackson, Jeremy Maclin, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Torrey Smith, Michael Vick, and Brian Westbrook. Their opponents included Victor Cruz of the New York Giants, Devin Hester of the Chicago Bears, Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers, Hakeem Nicks of the New York Giants, Ray Rice of the Baltimore Ravens, and Mike Wallace of the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nAny proceeds collected for the LeSean McCoy Celebrity Softball Game are directed to the LeSean McCoy Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization that serves to raise funds and awareness for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. LeSean McCoy is motivated by his grandmother's death due to ALS. Additionally, the Foundation also provides for the underprivileged in Central Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. Some of the money collected from the 2012 game provided Christmas toys to the Boys and Girls Club and the Salvation Army, sports gear to the Police Athletic League, a professional football game and a winter vacation for families affected by ALS, winter coats and backpacks containing necessary school supplies for impoverished children, and winter coats for a women's and children's shelter in Philadelphia.\n\nClipper Magazine Stadium has hosted various concerts, including rock musicians Bob Dylan, Bryan Adams, Def Leppard, and Jefferson Starship; country music artists Clint Black, Dwight Yoakam, and Willie Nelson; and smooth jazz instrumentalist Kenny G.\n\nOn July 16, 2009, Clipper Magazine Stadium hosted an exhibition match between the Harrisburg City Islanders and Crystal Palace, an English team based in London. The ballpark's infield was covered with grass sod in order to convert it for the game. Additionally, local soccer training was scheduled at Clipper Magazine Stadium to maximize the soccer pitch's use.\n\nIn August 2015, the venue hosted two professional soccer games. The first featured the Harrisburg City Islanders versus FC Montreal, both members of the United Soccer League. The second match included the Philadelphia Union, a Major League Soccer club, versus Harrisburg. \n\nFor the 2016 season the Harrisburg City Islanders will call Clipper Magazine Stadium home for 5 regular season games throughout the season. With the other 10 home games being played at FNB Field on City Island in Harrisburg\n\n"}

It is run at the Curragh over a distance of 1 mile and 4 furlongs (2,414 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late June or early July.\n\nIt is Ireland's equivalent of the Epsom Derby, and it is currently held three weeks after the English race.\n\nThe earliest version of the Irish Derby was an event called the O'Darby Stakes. This was established in 1817, but it was discontinued after 1824. A subsequent race titled the Curragh Derby was inaugurated in 1848, but this was again short-lived.\n\nThe modern Irish Derby was created by the 3rd Earl of Howth, the 3rd Marquess of Drogheda and the 3rd Earl of Charlemont. It was first run in 1866, and it was initially contested over 1 mile, 6 furlongs and 3 yards. It was extended by 9 yards in 1869, and cut to its present distance in 1872. The first Epsom Derby winner to achieve victory in the Irish version was Orby, trained in Ireland by Fred McCabe, in 1907.\n\nThe Irish Derby became a major international race in 1962, when its prize money was substantially increased. Joe McGrath, a founder of the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake, combined the race with the sweepstake, and it became known as the Irish Sweeps Derby. The event began to regularly attract the winners of the Epsom Derby, and Santa Claus became the second horse to win both races in 1964.\n\nThe Irish Derby was sponsored by Budweiser from 1986 to 2007, and it has been backed by Dubai Duty Free since 2008.

The arena, which was completed in 1967 by Minnesota Ice, just to the north of Metropolitan Stadium, seated 15,000. It was best known as the home of the Minnesota North Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1967 to 1993. For its first 15 years, its official name was the Metropolitan Sports Center; the more familiar shorter name was adopted in 1982.\n\nThe Met's other tenants included the ABA's Minnesota Muskies, which played just one season before moving to Miami for the 1968-69 season. The league responded by moving the defending champion Pittsburgh Pipers to Bloomington, but the Pipers left to return to Pittsburgh after the season. The NASL's Minnesota Kicks played two indoor seasons at the Met from 1979 to 1981. The Minnesota Strikers of the Major Soccer League (MISL) played indoor soccer at the Met Center from 1984 to 1988. The Boys' High School Hockey Tournament was also held there from 1969 to 1975.\n\nThe arena also held entertainment-related shows, including the very first performance of \"Sesame Street Live\" in September 1980.\n\nThe Met Center was considered to be one of the finest arenas in the NHL for many years, both for its sightlines, and its ice surface. Among NHL players, the Met was known for its fast ice and good lighting. Players also had much praise for the locker rooms and training facilities. The Met never boasted fancy amenities, and by comparison to modern arenas it had cramped concourses and very few frills (though some luxury suites were added in the 1980s). As a sports facility, it could best be described as utilitarian, a theme which repeated itself in most Minnesota sports facilities built before 1988 (such as Metropolitan Stadium and the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome). Like the Metrodome, the Met Center was heavily utilized as a Minnesota sports venue, hosting various high school hockey and basketball events over the course of its lifetime. Here are North Stars in action in the 1991 Clarence Campbell Finals Game 2 at Edmonton.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD1F8O0L2_Y\n\nAfter the North Stars moved to Dallas, Texas in 1993 and became the Dallas Stars, the Met Center was demolished on December 13, 1994 in a series of three controlled implosions. The series of implosions was required after the initial detonation (which was intended to be the only one) failed spectacularly to bring down the building on live television. The NHL returned to Minnesota in 2000 when the expansion Minnesota Wild began play at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. Meanwhile, the Harlem Globetrotters, an annual visitor to the Met Center, moved on, as had a large portion of Met Center's concert business, to Target Center.\n\nFor several years after the arena was demolished, the property served as an overflow lot for the Mall of America. In 2004, an IKEA store opened on the west end of the property, and the new American Boulevard was rerouted through the east end of the property. The remainder of the site is planned long-term to become the site of Mall of America Phase II, of which the IKEA would be an anchor store.\n\nJanet Jackson filmed the music video for \"Black Cat\" on 05/05/1990.\n\n"}

It was named after Paul Sauvé (March 24, 1907 – January 2, 1960), a Quebec Premier with the Union Nationale. \n\nThe arena hosted some of the most important events in modern Quebec political history. It was the site of the Parti Québécois election victory celebrations on November 15, 1976 and on April 13, 1981. Additionally, it was the site of two of the most important moments of the 1980 referendum. On May 14, 1980 Pierre Trudeau delivered his \"first among equals\" speech that was his major contribution to the campaign battle, and René Lévesque delivered his passionate concession speech on May 20, 1980.\n\nThe Paul Sauvé Arena was, most popularly, the home to Quebec professional wrestling. In the mid-1960s, Johnny Rougeau and partner Bob Langevin created \"Les As de la Lutte\" (Wrestling Aces) and made the arena its main venue for wrestling shows, which ran from 1965 to 1975. The arena was also home to a founding franchise in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. The Rosemont National played two seasons (from 1969 to 1971, finishing 8th and 9th) before moving to Laval.

The complex includes five inter-connected buildings with 330,000 square feet of exhibition space and 10 meeting rooms. It is adjacent to the Hadlock Field and the Portland Ice Arena.\n\nPhish, Ani Difranco, Natalie Merchant, The Monkees, and Rusted Root have played at the venue. It has also hosted trade shows and celebrations. It has been used for the Maine Red Claws basketball team, Portland High School Bulldogs basketball games, and indoor track events. In 2007, the Expo became the home of Maine Roller Derby. Locker rooms for Fitzpatrick Stadium, the visiting clubhouse for Hadlock Field as well as the Portland High School locker rooms are located downstairs.\n\nHome to over 270 events per year, the Portland Exposition Building hosts trade shows, concerts, sporting events, conferences, civic meetings, brew fests, High school indoor track meets, ski shows and other special events. Nearly 600,000 patrons pass through the Expo's turnstile each year.\n\nThe Portland Exposition Building was designed by Frederick A. Tompson and was built in 1914 at a cost of $80,944. It is the second oldest arena in continuous operation in the United States (behind Matthews Arena in Boston, Massachusetts).\n\nThe building was considered a sophisticated facility sure to \"put Portland on the map\".

Kennedy, President Barack Obama and Paavo Nurmi. It has also hosted significant performances including the first East Coast concert of the Beach Boys (1963), James Brown, Dolly Parton, Janis Joplin, Queen (1974), the 60th Anniversary Ball of the Portland Symphony Orchestra, world championship kickboxing, and gala banquets for the Senior's Pro Golf Tournaments featuring Arnold Palmer and Gary Player.\n\nIn September 2007, Maine Roller Derby began hosting flat-track roller derby bouts, with opponents traveling from Montreal, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. The season runs from late April through November, with most bouts occurring April–June.\n\nIn 2008, a group of local businesspeople signed a deal to bring an NBA Development League team to the Portland Exposition Building as well as to renovate the arena's facilities. It was confirmed, and the Expo Building is home to the Maine Red Claws, beginning play for the 2009–10 season.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5780457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5780457", "title": "Skurfing (sport)", "text": "Skurfing (sport)\n\nSkurfing as a sport has two common forms: \"water skurfing\" and \"street skurfing\".\n\nWater Skurfing was inspired by an unknown man being pulled by a boat on a surfboard in Lake Havasu, AZ. Water Skurfing is a form of water skiing that uses a surfboard or similar board instead of skis. The skurfer is towed behind a motorboat at planing speed with a tow rope similar to that of Knee Boarding and wakeboarding. It shares an advantage with kneeboarding in that the motorboat does not require as much speed as it does for water skiing.\n\nSkurfing is a towsport and it is very similar to water skiing. The skurfboard, however, is a surfboard and is usually shorter by about two feet, wider and has three larger fins that make the board easier to manoeuvre while being pulled behind a boat. The planing speed of the motorboat is equivalent to the speed generated by a wave and allows the skurfer to ride behind the boat the same way a surfer would ride a wave. One of the advantages of skurfing when compared with surfing is that when the water is flat, skurfing is still possible. Skurfing can be done behind a boat or a jet ski on a river or in an ocean. The manoeuvres on a skurfboard are similar to those on a surfboard, these include.\n\nFreeriding is when the wake is surfed without the rope. First the rider pulls themselves up the rope so that they are skurfing in the largest part of the wake. The rider then gently pumps the board to maintain speed and moves their weight further forward to help them stay on the wake wave. Once they are being propelled by the wake the rope is thrown back into the boat.\n\nSkurfing has developed into its own unique sport but has also been used in adapting other sports such as surfing. Before skurfing was invented there were limitations to paddling onto larger waves when surfing because surfers lacked the speed needed to stay in front of the wave. Skurfing has shown the world the potential of big wave surfing by towing the surfer towards big waves. Therefore, giving the surfer the speed needed to catch the wave successfully.\n\nThe early usage was a portmanteau of skiing (as in water skiing) and surfing, and was used to describe a popular surface water sport in which the participant is towed on a surfboard behind a boat with a ski rope.\n\nAlthough the \"Skurfer\" (a branded water-sport product) was originally trademarked by a surfer named Tony Finn in the mid 1980s, the word 'Skurfing' was potentially first coined in New Zealand by surfboard shaper Allan Byrne. Allan Byrne lent a surfboard to Jeff Darby and friends in Queensland Australia who started to make their own and later came in contact with Tony Finn who was to later produce the brand Skurfer' under royalty.\n\nMany years prior to Tony Finn and the 'Skurfer', Australian surfboard shaper and inventor Bruce McKee along with associate Mitchell Ross, launched the world's first \nmass-produced plastic roto-moulded construction 'Skurfboard' named the 'Mcski', later renamed 'SSS' skiboard and then 'Wake-snake' in Australia. The board had adjustable rubber foot-straps, concave tunnel bottom and a keel fin. Two smaller side fins were later added for greater hold and more maneuverability.\n\nBruce McKee and associate Mitchell Ross negotiated with USA's Medalist Waterskis and the first American production was launched.\nThe launch of the product's American version being named the 'Surf-Ski' was in 1984 at Chicagos 'IMTEC' show. At the show McKee also met Tony Finn who was the proposed Californian representative. \nTony Finn, went on to do his own negotiations with Darby and company from Australia and the result as mentioned above were the US boards later launched under the 'Skurfer' brand name.\nSurfing is highly popular in the state of Western Australia and in many other places in the world. Unlike most other water sports where the participant is towed, water skurfing is not a professional sport and has no official competitions. It is a freestyle sport with highly individualistic style and form. There are no defined styles or conventions, rather it is about personal style.\n\nWater Skurfing is considered by many to be a precursor to wakeboarding, as the skurfboards evolved in the late 1980s into compression-moulded products (aka \"skiboards\") then eventually into the twin-tipped Wakeboard.\nThere are two main styles of water skurfing, the noseriding style, mostly used by people who surf on a longboard. The alternative is with cutbacks, carves and other turns. Some skurfers even get air over the wake.\n\nA new style of water skurfing has recently emerged in the sport where the fins are removed from the bottom of the board. This finless style requires more balance and finesse than having the fins attached. Not having fins limits cutbacks and carving, but allows the rider to spin the board around in a 360-degree rotation.\n\nThis usage is a portmanteau of Skateboarding and Surfing. See also Freeline skates.\n\nStreet Skurfing is the melding of many elements of skateboarding with the technical and practically applicable skills gained from slalom, downhill, or any other side-sport disciplines such as surfing, snowboarding, skateboarding, and casterboarding. It focuses heavily on spins, slides, \"stance\" changes, and carving. There are no set rules, tricks, or techniques except the heavy emphasis of a fluid and surf-like execution through a course. The usually adopted terrain is a mix of steep grade roads, driveways, concrete banks, and ditches.\n\nThere are two types of styles for street skurfing. The first style involves a single board (often a skateboard or custom-cut deck). The second style is actually a common term used for caster skating. It involves two separated boards or skates instead of a single skateboard. One of the advantages of having separated skates is that the rider can maneuver with both feet individually. In addition, Street Skurfing involves making much tighter turns, s-shape motions, and even travelling up and down hills.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2982620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2982620", "title": "The exchange (chess)", "text": "The exchange (chess)\n\nThe exchange in chess refers to a situation in which one player loses a minor piece (i.e. a bishop or knight) but captures the opponent's rook. The side which wins the rook is said to have \"won the exchange\", while the other player has \"lost the exchange\", since the rook is usually more valuable. Alternatively, the side that has won the rook is \"up the exchange\", and the other player is \"down the exchange\". The opposing captures often happen on consecutive moves, although this is not strictly necessary. It is generally detrimental to lose the exchange, although occasionally one may find reason to purposely do so; the result is an \"exchange sacrifice\" (see below). The \"minor exchange\" is an uncommon term for the exchange of a bishop and knight.\n\nNote that \"the\" exchange differs from the more general \"exchange\" or \"an exchange\", which refers to the loss and subsequent gain of arbitrary pieces, for example to \"exchange queens\" would mean that each side's queen is captured .\n\nThe value of the exchange (i.e. the difference between a rook and a minor piece) has been considered for decades. Siegbert Tarrasch put its value as 1½ pawns in the endgame, but not for the opening or the first part of the middlegame. That is widely accepted today, but Jacob Sarratt, Howard Staunton, and José Capablanca felt that the exchange was worth two pawns. Tigran Petrosian thought that one pawn was the right value. Wilhelm Steinitz said that a rook is slightly better than a knight and two pawns but slightly worse than a bishop and two pawns . Cecil Purdy said that the value depends on the total number of pawns on the board. The reason is that when there are many pawns, the rooks will have limited mobility because there will not be open files. The exchange is barely worth 1½ points when there are 14 or more pawns on the board. Only when there are ten or fewer pawns may the exchange be worth 2 points . Purdy gave the value as 1½ points in the opening and increasing to 2 points in the endgame. In the middlegame the value would be closer to 1½ than to 2 . Edmar Mednis gave the value as 1½ in the endgame , . Max Euwe put the value at 1½ in the middlegame and said that two pawns are more than sufficient compensation for the exchange . Larry Kaufman's computer research puts the value as 1¾ pawns, but only 1¼ pawns if the player with the minor piece has the . Hans Berliner puts the difference between a rook and knight as 1.9 pawns and the difference between a rook and a bishop as 1.77 pawns . In practice, one pawn may be sufficient compensation for the loss of the exchange, whereas two pawns almost always is .\n\nIn the middlegame, the advantage of an exchange is usually enough to win the game if the side with the rook has one or more pawns. In an endgame without pawns, the advantage of the exchange is normally not enough to win (see pawnless chess endgame). The most common exceptions when there are no pawns are (1) a rook versus a bishop in which the defending king is trapped in a corner of the same color as his bishop, (2) a knight separated from its king that may be cornered and lost, and (3) the king and knight are poorly placed .\n\nIn the endgame of a rook and a pawn versus a knight and a pawn, if the pawns are passed the rook is much stronger and should win. If the pawns are not passed, the side with knight has good drawing chances if its pieces are well-placed .\n\nIn the endgame of a rook and a pawn versus a bishop and pawn, If the pawns are on the same file, the bishop has good chances to draw if the pawns are blocked and the opposing pawn is on a square the bishop can attack; otherwise the rook usually wins. If the pawns are passed the rook normally wins. If the pawns are not passed and are on adjacent files, it is difficult to assess but the bishop may be able to draw .\nIn an endgame with more pawns on the board (i.e. a rook and pawns versus a minor piece with the same number of pawns) the rook usually wins . This position is typical. The superior side should remember these things:\n\nIf the minor piece has an extra pawn (i.e. one pawn for the exchange), the rook should win, but with difficulty. If the minor piece has two extra pawns, the endgame should be a draw .\n\nAn \"exchange sacrifice\" occurs when one player gives up a rook for a minor piece. It is often used to destroy the enemy pawn structure (as in several variations of the Sicilian Defence where Black captures a knight on c3 with a rook), to establish a minor piece on a strong square (often threatening the enemy king), to improve one's own pawn structure (creating, for example, connected passed pawns such as in A Yurgis vs. Botvinnik, 1931), or to gain time for development. The exchange sacrifice contrasts with other sacrifices in that during the early-middle to middle game the board is sufficiently crowded to where the rook is not as effective as an active knight or a good bishop, this is why such exchange sacrifices happen usually from moves 20 to 30, and rarely occur in the later moves. When they do occur in the endgame, it is usually to create and promote a passed pawn . Subsequently, the relative importance of the pieces might be different than the standardized Chess piece relative value system and takes advantage of the fluctuating values of the pieces during the progression of the game. The sacrifice might also be used to increase the influence of one's own minor pieces by eliminating opposition from their counterparts (such as in the Petrosian versus Spassky game below, where even a double exchange sacrifice was successful). A common example of this idea is the elimination an opponent's bishop, with the expectation that in doing so one's own bishop will increase in power from being unopposed on the color squares in which it resides. There is often more dynamic play and positional considerations such as pawn structure or piece placement compared to sacrifices due to a mating attack or a pawn sacrifice to gain the initiative. Sometimes the exchange can be sacrificed purely on long term positional objectives, as frequently demonstrated by former world champion Tigran Petrosian.\n\nIn this 2004 game between Ivan Sokolov and World Champion Vladimir Kramnik, White gave up the exchange for a pawn in order to create two strong connected passed pawns. The game continued:\nand White won on move 41 .\n\nTigran Petrosian, the World Champion from 1963–1969, was well known for his especially creative use of this device. He once responded (only half jokingly), when asked what was his favourite piece, as saying \"The rook, because I can sacrifice it for minor pieces!\" In the game Reshevsky versus Petrosian at the 1953 Candidates Tournament in Zurich, he sacrificed the exchange on move 25, only for his opponent to sacrifice it in return on move 30. This game is perhaps the most famous and most frequently taught example of the exchange sacrifice.\n\nThere are no open files in this position for the rooks to exploit. Black sacrificed the exchange with \nWith the rook not on e7, the black knight will be able to get to a strong outpost on d5. From there the knight will be attacking the pawn on c3, and if the white bishop on b2 does not move to d2, it will be of little use. In addition, it will be practically impossible to break Black's defense on the white squares. The next few moves were:\nThe game was drawn on move 41 .\n\nIn the tenth game from the 1966 World Chess Championship between defending champion Tigran Petrosian and challenger Boris Spassky contained two exchange sacrifices by White. Black had just moved \nWhite responded with an exchange sacrifice:\nWhite had no choice: 21. Rf2? Rxf4 22. Rxf4 Qg5+, etc. The game continued:\nAnd now a second exchange sacrifice:\nBlack is helpless, despite being two exchanges ahead. White won back an exchange on move 29. On move 30 White forced the win of the other rook and the exchange of queens. Black resigned because the position was a winning endgame for White (two knights and five pawns versus one knight and four pawns) . Petrosian won the match by one game to retain his title.\n\nIn a 1994 game between World Champion Garry Kasparov and Alexei Shirov, White sacrificed a pure exchange (rook for a bishop) with the move 17. Rxb7!!. As compensation for the sacrifice, Black became weak on the white squares, which were dominated by White's bishop. The exchange sacrifice also deprived Black of the bishop pair and his remaining bishop was a bad bishop. Black returned the exchange on move 28, making the material equal, but White had a strong initiative. Black missed a better 28th move after which White could have forced a draw, but would have had no clear advantage. White won the game on move 38 .\nThe minor exchange refers to the capture of the opponent's bishop for the player's knight (or, more recently, the stronger minor piece for the weaker) . Bobby Fischer used the term , but it is rarely used.\n\nIn most chess positions, a bishop is worth slightly more than a knight because of its longer range of movement. As a chess game progresses, pawns tend to get traded, removing support points from the knight and opening up lines for the bishop. This generally leads to the bishop's advantage increasing over time.\n\nTraditional chess theory espoused by masters such as Wilhelm Steinitz and Siegbert Tarrasch puts more value on the bishop than the knight. In contrast, the hypermodern school favored the knight over the bishop. Modern theory is that it depends on the position, but that there are more positions where the bishop is better than where the knight is better .\n\nThere are some occasions when a knight can be worth more than a bishop, so this exchange is not necessarily made at every opportunity to do so.\n\nA rook and bishop usually work better together than a rook and knight in the endgame , . José Raúl Capablanca stated that a queen and knight work better together than a queen and bishop in the endgame . More recently, John Watson has stated that from his study of this endgame that an unusually large proportion of queen and knight versus queen and bishop endings are drawn, and that most decisive games are characterized by the winning side having one or more obvious advantages (for example, having a knight against a bad bishop in a position, or having a bishop in a position with pawns on both sides of the board, particularly if the knight has no natural outpost). Watson states that positions in this endgame in general \"are very volatile, and often the winning side is simply the one who starts out being able to win material or launch an attack on the opposing king\" . Glenn Flear agrees with that assessment for endgames. He could not find an endgame by Capablanca that supported his statement. The statistics for queen and bishop versus queen and knight endgames are about even. Most decisive games were won because of a significant advantage from the middlegame and only a limited number of positions show an inherent superiority for one over the other .\n\n\n\n"}
