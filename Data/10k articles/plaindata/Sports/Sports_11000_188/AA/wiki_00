{"id": "1084104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1084104", "title": "Bell MTS Place", "text": "Bell MTS Place\n\nBell MTS Place is an indoor arena in downtown Winnipeg, Manitoba. The arena is the home of the National Hockey League's Winnipeg Jets and their American Hockey League affiliate, the Manitoba Moose.\n\nThe arena stands on the former Eaton's site and is owned and operated by True North Sports & Entertainment. The 440,000 square feet (41,000 m) building was constructed at a cost of $133.5 million CAD. It opened on November 16, 2004, replacing the since-demolished Winnipeg Arena. It has a capacity of 15,321 for hockey and 16,345 for concerts.\n\nOriginally known as the \"True North Centre\" during its planning and construction stages, it was named the MTS Centre as part of a naming rights agreement with Manitoba Telecom Services. It was renamed Bell MTS Place on May 30, 2017 following Bell Canada's acquisition of MTS.\n\nWith the bankruptcy of the iconic Eaton's retailer, the famed store that was originally constructed in Winnipeg was emptied in late 2001. Various alternative uses for the building (including residential condominiums) were suggested, but ultimately the arena was deemed to be the most viable and beneficial to the city's struggling downtown by Winnipeg Mayor Glen Murray and True North. After a small, but emotional resistance to losing the Western Canadian landmark Eaton's building by some locals and the Save the Eaton's Coalition, which inspired a \"group hug\" of the \"Big Store\" by a reported 180 people in 2001, the store was demolished in 2002 to make way for the new entertainment complex.\n\nThe MTS Centre officially opened on November 16, 2004, replacing the aging Winnipeg Arena, which had been in operation since 1955. In an effort to recognize the store's history, red bricks were incorporated into the design of the arena façade, evoking the memory of the Eaton's store that had once graced Portage Avenue. An original store window and Tyndall stone surround is mounted in the arena concourse to house a collection of Eaton's memorabilia. In addition, two war memorials were incorporated into the building. The Timothy Eaton statue that was once a main feature of the store is also housed in the MTS Centre, near the spot where it stood in the Eaton's building.\n\n The AHL's Manitoba Moose were the arena's first tenant, from its opening in 2004 to 2011. The team relocated to St. John's prior to the 2011–12 AHL season to make way for the arrival of the Winnipeg Jets. The Moose returned to the MTS Centre for the 2015–16 season, making the arena the first (together with the SAP Center at San Jose) to be home to both an NHL team and its AHL affiliate. Only the lower bowl, which has a capacity of 8,812, is used for the majority of Moose home games.\n\nThe arena hosted the AHL All-Star Classic on February 1, 2006, in which Team Canada defeated Team PlanetUSA, 9-4.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1996, the original Winnipeg Jets played home games out of the now-demolished Winnipeg Arena. Facing mounting financial troubles, the franchise relocated to Arizona after the 1995–96 NHL season and became the Phoenix Coyotes.\n\nThe idea of Winnipeg one day returning to the NHL gained momentum after the MTS Centre opened. David Thomson and Mark Chipman were floated as potential owners of an NHL team, although many questions were raised about the MTS Centre's potential suitability as an NHL venue. The arena's capacity was well below that of the next-smallest NHL arena at that time, the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, which sat 16,170 but lacked modern design elements. Chipman stated that the arena's current size was sufficient for an NHL team due to the unique economics of the local market.\n\nOn May 19, 2011, \"The Globe and Mail\" reported that Mark Chipman and True North were finalizing the purchase of the Atlanta Thrashers, with the intent of moving the team to Winnipeg. Twelve days later, True North chairman Mark Chipman, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, and Premier of Manitoba Greg Selinger held a press conference at the MTS Centre to announce the deal, which was formally approved by the NHL Board of Governors three weeks later. As part of the transition to the NHL, the arena went through some minor renovations to bring it in line with the league's standards, including construction of additional press boxes, shuttered lighting, flexible rink glass, and an upgraded ice refrigeration system. Further improvements were made over the next few years, including concourse improvements, installation of a new high-definition scoreboard, and the replacement of metal rails with plexiglass to eliminate obstructed views around the arena. A total of 278 premium seats were added to the upper level in 2015, slightly increasing the arena's capacity.\n\nPrior to the return of the Jets, the MTS Centre hosted several NHL preseason games. The first was held on September 17, 2006 between the Edmonton Oilers and the Phoenix Coyotes (the former Winnipeg Jets) in front of a sold-out crowd, which the Oilers won 5–0. The NHL exhibition game became an annual event for the MTS Centre, concluding in September 2010 when the defending Stanley Cup Champions Chicago Blackhawks, led by captain and Winnipeg-born Jonathan Toews, played the Tampa Bay Lightning in front of a crowd of 14,092.'\n\nWith a capacity of just over 15,300 for NHL games, Bell MTS Place is the smallest arena in the NHL.\n\nIn international hockey, the arena hosted the 2007 IIHF Women's World Championship, which was won by the host country. Other international matches hosted at the arena included 2005 World Junior Championship pretournament games, the fifth game of the 2007 Super Series between Canada and Russia, and the medal round of the 2011 World U-17 Hockey Challenge.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26312181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26312181", "title": "Bowlmor Lanes", "text": "Bowlmor Lanes\n\nBowlmor Lanes is the upscale brand of ten-pin bowling and entertainment centers operated by Bowlero Corporation. There are currently 18 Bowlmor Lanes centers, nine of which are former AMF 300 centers and three are former AMF Bowling Centers.\n\nBowlmor Lanes centers aim to provide \"high-end\" bowling in a modern lounge setting which includes audiovisual technology, such as plasma screens for automatic scoring and movie screens above the lanes, plus glow lighting, and glow-in-the-dark lanes. Bowlmor Lanes centers also have DJ booths, sports bars and video arcades, miniature golf, bocce, table shuffleboard, ping pong tables, air hockey, billiards, and boardwalk games, private party facilities with catering services, and full service restaurants. Bowlero claims its Bowlmor Lanes brand has a 35-50% return on equity.\n\nIn 1938 Nick Gianos opened the original Bowlmor Lanes in New York City's Union Square. The opening came right at the start of the Golden Age of bowling, the 1940s through the 1960s, when the invention of the automatic pinsetter propelled bowling's popularity to its highest. Bowlmor Lanes was at the forefront of the bowling revolution, hosting the prestigious Landgraf Tournament in 1942 and one of the first televised bowling tournaments, the East vs. West, broadcast on New York City radio station WOR in 1954. In 1958, Vice President Richard Nixon bowled at the center. Through the 70's and 80's Bowlmor Lanes was home to the top bowlers in the sport.\n\nNick Gianos's son John took over the business in 1981, and by 1997 he was feeling the pressure of rising rent and the need to modernize.\n\nThat year, 1992 Darden School of Business graduate Tom Shannon attended a birthday party at the now dilapidated bowling center. Shannon saw the potential in the property and purchased it for $1.4 million \"to inject the tired business with hip design, upscale cuisine, and a full bar, and then market Bowlmor as a party venue.\"\n\nShannon then borrowed $2 million from friends, family, and Bowlmor's sellers to transform the center. Changes included installation of video screens, glow in the dark lanes and balls, and lane-side food and drink service. Shannon eliminated bowling leagues, \"to ease out those who did not cotton to the fancy trappings or higher prices,\" in favor of promotions and events aimed at attracting new fans to the sport. By 1999, Bowlmor Lanes Union Square was the highest-grossing bowling center in the United States. The center was closed in July 2014 when it lost its lease.\n\nWith the success of the Union Square location, Shannon’s company, Strike Holdings LLC, went on to replicate the Bowlmor Lanes concept in other markets. In 2001, Strike Bethesda opened in suburban Washington, D.C. A year later, Strike Long Island was opened in an underground space housing 35 lanes of bowling, a full-service restaurant, and four bars. In November 2004, the 34 lane Strike Miami opened in the Dolphin Mall in the Doral section of the city, featuring a sports themed restaurant. Strike Cupertino (Silicon Valley), California opened at Vallco Shopping Mall in the summer of 2007 and Strike Orange County, CA opened in the summer of 2008. The properties were rebranded as Bowlmor Lanes soon after.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, Strike Holdings opened its largest location in the former New York Times newsroom in New York City's Times Square. The Bowlmor Lanes facility features seven bowling lounges designed with New York themes, from Manhattan Chinatown (featuring a gong that is hit upon bowling a strike) to Art Deco and Central Park (including items purchased from the Tavern on the Green auction) to Prohibition, plus a full stage with dance floor, a sports bar with stadium-style seating, boardwalk games, and a miniature golf course.\n\nBowlmor's revenues rose from approximately $1.9 million from its single facility in the year ending December 31, 1997 (close to double the revenues for the same facility in the prior year under prior management) to approximately $37.1 million for all locations in the year ending December 31, 2012. Bowlmor locations have earned several hundred thousand dollars per lane per year making it one of the highest grossing bowling facility operators in North America.\n\nIn 2013 the much larger AMF Bowling Worldwide was reorganized and combined with Strike Holdings LLC to form Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation), with Tom Shannon as its Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President.\n\nShannon was named Bowling Proprietor of the Year in 2001 and again in 2014 by Bowlers Journal International Magazine and a Top Entrepreneur of 2008 by Crain's New York Business.\n\n"}

It was named in honor of Urbano Caldeira, former player, manager and chairman of Santos, in 1933. The ground, given the nickname \"Vila Belmiro\" due to its location within the Vila Belmiro neighborhood, has been Santos' permanent residence since 1916. However, the club sometimes uses the Pacaembu Stadium located in the city of São Paulo for important matches due to the low capacity of Vila Belmiro.\n\nThe ground underwent several expansions and renovations in the 1990s and 2000s (decade), most notably the renewal of the irrigation and drainage systems, flood-lighting and the replacement of the field. The stadium's current highest attendance was recorded in 1964, when 32,989 spectators watched the Campeonato Paulista match between Santos and Corinthians.\n\nThe Estádio Urbano Caldeira is located on the Princesa Isabel street, in the neighborhood of Vila Belmiro, occupying the block bounded by the streets of Tiradentes, Don Pedro I, and José de Alencar. The venue is 600 feet (182.88 meters) in between the avenues of Senator Pinheiro Machado and Dr. Bernadino de Campos.\n\nSoon after its foundation, Santos held their training in a field located in the neighborhood of Macuco. As the field did not meet the minimum size standards to host official matches, Santos played on the \"Igreja Coração de Maria\" pitch in Ana Costa Avenue. The field, however, was also used by other clubs in town. In 1915, the situation reached its breaking point, when Santos had constant conflicts with other city clubs on when the field could be used, forcing the club to reject several requests for international friendlies. To solve the problem, the leaders began searching for land in the city, with a commission formed by Luiz Suplicy Júnior, Harold Cross, Sebastião Arantes Nogueira and Francisco Viriato Corrêa da Costa. On May 31, 1916, a general assembly approved the purchase of an area of 16,500 square meters, in the neighborhood of Vila Belmiro, approved by club president Agnello Cícero de Oliveira and vice-president Dr. Álvaro Ribeiro. The land acquired belonged to \"Companhia de Habitações Econômicas\", and the field was bought from them at a price of Rs$66,660,000. The board members obtained a 10-year loan which was liquified in 1923 after paying Rs$35,000,000 in interest fees. \n\nThe club, however, did not obtain a nearby area belonging to \"Beneficência Portuguesa\", since the club's finances did not favor this. It would not be acquired until 1989. The original date for the inauguration of the field was August 20; it was postponed until further notice due to the death of Dr. Álvaro Ribeiro. On October 12 of that year, the inauguration of the \"Vila Belmiro\" sports park was celebrated with several ceremonies among the members, including a march by musical corporation \"Humanitária\", to see off playing on Macuco field. The first game was held 10 days later at 13:30 (UTC-3), against Ypiranga for the 1916 Campeonato Paulista, the competition's 491st match, which Santos won 2–1. Ticket prices were set at Rs$2 for bleacher and Rs$1 for the general public. Adolfo Millon Jr. scored the first ever goal on that stadium with Jarbas scoring the second, while Bororó scored for the visiting team. Santos was formed by: Odorico; Américo and Arantes; Pereira, Oscar and Junqueira; Millon, Marba, Tedesco, Jarbas and Arnaldo. Ypiranga was represented by Dionísio; Dario and Ferreira; Loschiavo, Jacintho and Peres II; Ary, Hugo, Bororó, Peres I and Formiga. Demosthenes de Silos was the referee for the match.\n\nThe first major renovation occurred in 1931. On March 21, of that year, the stadium renovated its stands and an illumination system was installed. Twenty hours later, the club's first late match was played against a combined team from the city of Santos, with the club losing to its city counterpart 0–1. Manoel Cruz, a midfielder from Portuguesa Santista, scored the only goal of the match.\n\nAfter Urbano Caldeira died on March 12, 1933, Ricardo Pinto de Oliveira, one of the club board members at that time, wanted to pay homage to Caldeira by naming the stadium after him. After a meeting which included all club members, the naming of the stadium was given a positive vote. Twenty-two years later, the first concrete stand was built where the current electrical score–keeping screen is located at. Called \"A Vila Mais Famosa do Mundo\" (The World's Most Famous Village), the Estádio Urbano Caldeira also came to be called after the era of \"Os Santásticos\" (1956–1973) the \"Alçapão da Vila (The Village Trap) because opposing team often left the ground defeated. Due to the proximity of the stands with the field where the matches unfolds, the pressure that the fans have on opposing teams was said to be incredible. After the golden age, the Vila Belmiro became synonymous with \"Joga Bonito\".\n\nIn that stadium of modest dimensions, stars of past and present such Pelé, Coutinho, Pepe, Giovanni, Pitta, Robinho, Diego, Neymar and Paulo Henrique Ganso became figures for the national team. For many years Vila Belmiro was the place where Pelé demonstrated his skills. On November 21, 1964, at Vila Belmiro, Pelé scored eight goals against Botafogo (SP), when Santos beat the opposing squad 11–0. On October 2, 1974, Pelé played his farewell game at the stadium. In that match, Santos beat Ponte Preta 2–0.\n\nThe stadium's attendance record currently stands at 32,989, set on September 20, 1964 when Santos and Corinthians drew 0–0. However, the record was overshadowed by a tragic event, as part of the stadium bleachers collapsed, resulting in injury to 181 spectators. The match was abandoned and rescheduled 10 days later, in the Pacaembu.\nDuring the 1996 Campeonato Paulista, the stadium was closed because the field was in a poor condition. During this time Santos FC played in many stadiums, including the Estádio Bruno José Daniel in Santo André and the Pacaembu Stadium in São Paulo. After that, the stadium was modified to adopt a system of drainage and irrigation systems controlled by computer. On July 20, 1997, Santos inaugurated the new stadium bleachers, located behind the goal net where, today, the visiting fans are located at. On January 27, 1998, during a game between Santos FC and Delia Tavano, a new illumination system was used, with level of 1,200 lux, more than the FIFA minimum recommendation. \n\nOn November 17, 2003, Santos FC opened the \"Memorial das Conquistas\", a place inside the stadium as the club memorial, containing trophies, medals, documents, shirts, posters, movies and many other items that recount the club's history. Visitors can also enter the team clock room, press room and the pitch, and, at the end of a tour, can buy club products in a club store inside the stadium. In 2009, the new electronic scoreboard was purchased, twice the size of the previous panel, and provides the score of the game, shows materials, promotions and news of Santos. In addition, the stadium has acquired new seats. More than five thousand seats were installed to better serve members of the club. The seats have been approved by FIFA and were imported from Europe.\n\nThe Vila Belmiro was one of the venues of the 1949 Copa América, hosted the 1962 Copa Libertadores final and the 1998 Copa CONMEBOL final. It has also hosted a Copa do Brasil final in 2010. Due to its relative-low capacity, Santos has used other stadiums for high-profile matches such as the Estádio Palestra Itália, Pacaembu and Morumbi, all located in São Paulo, and the Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro. Current Santos President Luís Álvaro Ribeiro and other club directors are agreeing on building a stadium in a city nearby Santos called Cubatão, a stadium for 40,000 people which would become Santos' home field for almost 70% of the games during the season which would increase the team's profit.\n\nSantos built a space to receive visitors and tourists interested in knowing the history and achievements of the club in 2003. Named the \"Memorial das Conquistas\", it is one of the main attractions of the Estádio Urbano Caldeira, inaugurated by Pelé, Cabralzinho and Marcelo Texeira. The museum's collection is distributed over an area of 380 square meters. In addition to trophies, there are life-size photos, banners, documents, uniforms, balls, and other multimedia objects. Visitors are greeted by bilingual guides, available to answer queries regarding the club's history and exhibits at the museum.\n\nThe material is divided into thematic areas.

Davis Stadium is a minor league baseball park in Huntsville, Alabama, United States, which hosted the Huntsville Stars of the Southern League from 1985 until 2014, and then served as a temporary home for the Stars' successor (the Biloxi Shuckers) in 2015.\n\nBuilt in 1985, the stadium is located on the grounds of Huntsville's former airport, adjacent to Huntsville's main north–south thoroughfare, U.S. Highway 231 (S. Memorial Parkway). The stadium is a multi-purpose facility that seats 10,488 with 15 air-conditioned skyboxes. Ticket offices and the general office are located on the second floor of the stadium. Closed circuit television above the main concourse allows for viewing of the game while grabbing a bite at the concession stands. In addition to baseball, Joe W. Davis Stadium has been used for high school football, monster truck rallies, and concerts.\n\nNicknamed \"The Crown Jewel of the Southern League\" upon its construction, the stadium was the oldest venue in the league during its final year of operation.\n\nThe stadium is named for the longtime mayor of Huntsville, Joe W. Davis, who was instrumental in the city's efforts to construct the stadium. Construction came about in 1984 after Nashville Sounds owner Larry Schmittou purchased the Evansville Triplets with the intent of moving the team in 1985 to Nashville, Tennessee to effectively elevate his Double-A Sounds to the Triple-A level. As a result of this move, the existing Double-A franchise needed a new home. Schmittou considered a swap, which would have sent the Double-A team to Evansville, Indiana to replace the Triplets. Evansville city leaders balked at the requested stadium upgrades, leading Schmittou to seek alternate arrangements, which resulted in the franchise's move to Huntsville. The team became known as the Huntsville Stars, and Schmittou continued to own the franchise until selling it to a local ownership group in 1994.\n\nThe first game was held on April 19, 1985. The Stars defeated the Birmingham Barons 10-0 in a game that included a grand slam from future major-leaguer Jose Canseco.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, renovations began on the stadium, including the replacement of all the stadium's box seats. In 2004, Joe Davis Stadium's current scoreboard, a 36-by-48-foot scoreboard complete with LED numbering and a 12-by-18-foot videoboard, was installed.\n\nIn 2014, the Stars were sold to an ownership group with the intent of relocating the franchise to Biloxi, Mississippi at the end of the season. The sale followed years of failed attempts to secure a new ballpark for the team in Huntsville. However, due to construction delays preventing the new Biloxi stadium from being completed in time for the Southern League's 2015 opening day, and because the franchise was still operating under a lease to use Joe Davis Stadium, the newly-christened Biloxi Shuckers played 15 of its first 25 scheduled home games in Huntsville. (The remaining ten home games were played with Biloxi acting as the home team on its opponents' home fields.)\n\nThe final game at Joe Davis Stadium was played on May 25, 2015 – a 7-2 rain-shortened win for the Shuckers over the Barons.\n\nThe Huntsville city government, which has owned the stadium since its construction, planned to demolish it sometime in 2015. As of May 2018, the stadium was still standing as the city continued to consider its fate.\n\n"}

It has been the home of the Rice Owls football team since its completion in 1950 and hosted Super Bowl VIII in 1974.\n\nArchitecturally, Rice Stadium is an example of modern architecture, with simple lines and an unadorned, functional design. The lower seating bowl is located below the surrounding ground level. Built solely for football, the stadium has excellent sightlines from almost every seat. To achieve this, the running track was eliminated so that spectators were closer to the action and each side of the upper decks was brought in at a concave angle to provide better sightlines. It is still recognized in many circles as the best stadium in Texas for watching a football game. Entrances and aisles were strategically placed so that the entire stadium could be emptied of spectators in nine minutes.\n\nIn 2006, Rice University upgraded the facility by switching from AstroTurf to FieldTurf and adding a modern scoreboard above the north concourse. Seating in the upper deck is in poor condition, which led the university to move home games for which large crowds were expected to nearby NRG Stadium.\n\nHigh school football games, especially neutral-site playoff games, are frequently played at Rice Stadium. It can also be used as a concert venue.\n\nRice Stadium replaced Rice Field (now Rice Track/Soccer Stadium), which had a total capacity of less than 37,000, in 1950. The new stadium was subsidized by the City of Houston, and it was designed by Hermon Lloyd & W.B. Morgan and Milton McGinty and built by Brown and Root. In addition to Rice, the University of Houston football team played at Rice Stadium from 1951 to 1965, and the Bluebonnet Bowl was played there from 1959 to 1967 and again in 1985 and 1986. The Houston Oilers also played in the stadium from 1965 to 1967. In 1974, Rice Stadium hosted Super Bowl VIII, in which the Miami Dolphins beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–7. It was the first Super Bowl played in Houston, and it would be 30 years later that the Super Bowl would return to Houston, which was played at Reliant Stadium.\n\nOn July 2, 1988, Rice Stadium hosted a stop on the Monsters of Rock tour. The tour was headlined by Van Halen and also featured Metallica, Scorpions, Dokken, and Kingdom Come. This was also the Texas World Music Festival.\n\nOn September 12, 1962, Rice Stadium hosted the speech in which President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to meet his goal, set the previous year, to send a man to the moon by the end of the decade. In the speech, he used a reference to Rice University football to help frame his rhetoric:\n\"But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the moon! We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.\"\n\nKennedy's comments implied Rice had a history of losing to Texas; however, the two football teams had split 5–5 in their previous 10 meetings and would tie the following month. On the other hand, Kennedy's comments about Rice-Texas might have been as forward-looking as his statements about going to the moon (which did occur in 1969): Since 1963, Rice has gone just 2-42 against Texas, including 28 straight losses between 1966 and 1993 and 12 straight from 1995 to the present.\n\nAs originally built, Rice Stadium seated 70,000, the second-largest stadium in the Southwest Conference (behind the Cotton Bowl). Rice Stadium was built before professional football came to Houston, and 70,000 fans might be expected to attend a college football game there. However, Rice found it increasingly difficult from the 1960s onward to compete against larger schools. In 2006, the end zones seats were covered with tarps, reducing seating capacity to 47,000. However, in the event of larger-than-expected crowds, it can easily be expanded to its full capacity, which is larger than the total number of Rice's living alumni. The average attendance for Rice football games in Rice Stadium was 13,353 in 2007. For the 2008 season, average home attendance was 20,179. During the 2009 season, average home attendance dipped once again to 13,552 per game. However, for the 2012 season it was 20,325.\n\nAround July 2015, construction began on the Brian Patterson Sports Performance Center. This building will make up the north end of the stadium, and contain a weight room, a home team locker room, coaching and staff offices. This will replace the north end seating, and lower possible capacity considerably. However, the seating removed consisted of crude concrete steps, and were rarely used. The building was named for donor and former Rice University football player and alumnus Brian Patterson.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26059", "title": "Roller hockey", "text": "Roller hockey\n\nRoller hockey is a form of hockey played on a dry surface using wheeled skates. Most professional inline hockey games take place on an indoor or outdoor sport court (a type of plastic interlinking tiles used to create a skating surface). Otherwise, any dry surface can be used to host a game, typically a roller rink, macadam, or cement. The term \"Roller hockey\" is often used interchangeably to refer to three variant forms chiefly differentiated by the equipment used. There is traditional \"Roller hockey\" (Quad hockey, Rink hockey), played with quad skates and a ball (without contact), \"Inline hockey\", played with inline skates and puck (without contact) and \"Skater hockey\", played with quad skates or inline skates and plastic ball (with contact like ice hockey). Combined, roller hockey is played in nearly 60 countries worldwide. \n\nRoller hockey is played on both quad skates and inline skates, have different rules and equipment, and involve different types of skating but share the category and name of roller hockey. Roller hockey (quad) is played using traditional quad roller skates, affording greater maneuverability to the player - this results in games filled with fancy footwork, tight maneuvering, and is more similar to football or basketball. The stick is more or less the same as in bandy and shinty. Roller hockey (inline) bears close resemblance to ice hockey and is played on inline skates, uses an ice hockey stick and includes a lot of fast \"racing back and forth\" action. Inline hockey goalies use a glove called a catcher to catch shots made on goal, and a flat, usually square, mitt called a blocker which is used to deflect shots on goal. The Quad hockey goalie uses a flat batting glove that provides rebound characteristics when blocking a shot on goal.\n\nQuad hockey is a variation of roller hockey. Roller hockey is the overarching name for a rollersport that has existed long before inline skates were \"re-invented\" in the 70s (They were actually invented before quads, in the 1760s). Roller hockey has been played on quad skates, in sixty countries worldwide and so has many names worldwide. Sometimes the sport is called Quad Hockey, (PT), (NL), (DE), International Style Ball hockey, (FR), (IT), (CA), (ES), (DA), (S), (ET) and Hardball hockey (US), depending on which region of the world it is played. Roller hockey was a demonstration rollersport in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.\n\nInline hockey is a variation of roller hockey very similar to ice hockey, from which it is derived. It is referred to by many names worldwide, including Ball Hockey, Inline hockey, Roller hockey, Longstick hockey, Deck hockey, Road hockey, Street hockey and Skater hockey depending on which region of the world in which it is played.\n\nLike ice hockey, inline hockey is a \"contact sport\" therefore body checking isn't penalized. It is similar to ice hockey in that teamwork, skill and aggressiveness are needed. Excepting the use of inline roller skates in lieu of ice skates, the equipment of inline roller hockey is similar to that of ice hockey.\n\nThe game is played by two teams, consisting of four skaters and one goalie, on a dry rink divided into two halves by a center line, with one net at each end of the rink. When played more informally, the game often takes place on a smooth asphalt surface outdoors. The game is played in three 15-minute periods or if it is higher standard it's played 20-minutes in each of the three periods. The game rules differ from ice hockey in a few simple ways: there is no icing and it is played in a 4 on 4 player format instead of 5 on 5.\n\nGenerally speaking, only competitive-level inline hockey is strictly bound by the governing body's rules. Recreational hockey leagues may make modifications to certain aspects of the rules to suit local requirements (size of rink, length of periods and penalties). Roller hockey is a growing sport in Britain with teams cropping up all over the country. The fact that it can be played on any dry surface means that it can be played in almost any leisure center.\n\nMost competitive youth hockey teams play in tournaments. The tournaments vary depending on location, but a typical bracket system is usually used. Teams travel to different locations around their state, sometimes even going out of state. There are inner state tournaments and out of state tournaments. There are even national tournaments competitive teams compete for.\n\nThe World Skate is the international association that organize the biggest roller hockey world championship (which is a part of the World Roller Games). Over twenty national teams participate in these two events.\n\nThere are other tournaments located in the U.S but played by players all around the world. Narch and Statewars are two Nationwide tournaments of every skill level and age group. \n\nIn skater hockey, the sport is governed in Europe by the International Inline-Skater hockey Federation.\n\nMany of the same brands that make ice hockey equipment also make roller hockey skates including Bauer, Easton, Mission, Tron and many more. There are also some brands that specialize in roller hockey like el Leon de Oro (Spain), Tour, Alkali, Revision and Mission (but they make some ice hockey equipment also). Other rink hockey brands include Reno, TVD, Meneghini, Proskate and Azemad.\n\n\n"}

Sometimes called a \"dust\" or \"hurling ball\", it resembles a baseball with more pronounced stitching. It is used in the Gaelic games of hurling, camogie, and rounders.\n\nAn official Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) sliotar, as used in top level hurling competitions such as the National Hurling League or the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championships is subject to strict regulations as regards its size, mass and composition.\n\nThe following regulations apply:\n\nApproved sliotars carry a GAA mark of approval. The GAA maintains a list of approved suppliers, based on manufacturers who pass their inspection.\n\nEarly (pre-GAA) sliotars used various materials, depending on the part of the country, including combinations of wood, leather, rope and animal hair and even hollow bronze.\n\nIn the early years of the GAA, there was no specific standard for the size or weight of sliotars. The man credited with initial standardisation of the sliotar is Ned Treston (1862–1949) of Gort, County Galway. He was selected to play in a match between South Galway and North Tipperary in February 1886 in Dublin. Prior the game, there was debate between the teams as regards the size of the sliotar. Treston made a sliotar at a nearby saddler, which was used in the game, and went on to be a prototype for the standard sliotar used from then on.\n\nJohnny McAuliffe (born 1896, Bruff, County Limerick; died 1960, in Limerick) is credited with the modern design. Before his improvements the ball tended to be inconsistent due to poor manufacturing. It was also heavier than modern sliotars (over 200g), and due to being made partly with horse-hair, tended to lose shape during play, and become soggy in wet conditions. The brown colour also meant that players tended to lose sight of the sliotar against crowded backdrops such as the crowd in Croke Park.\n\nMcAuliffe's changes were to introduce a cork core, with a 2 piece white-tanned leather covering as the standard materials. These changes led to a harder wearing ball, which had better visibility (the white-tanned pigskin was impervious to grass stains and water resistant). The construction materials also meant that the ball was only about half as heavy as Treston's version.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the GAA experimented with using sliotars with rubber rather than cork cores; however, it was found that using a rubber core led to a more unpredictable bounce, and moved a lot faster than a ball with a cork core, especially in wet conditions. It was decided to return to a cork ball in light of this.\n"}

It was first shown on the CTV Television Network in Canada as a four-hour miniseries and later on HBO in the United States. Directed by Michael Anderson and written by Chris Bryant, the film stars Steven Bauer and Michael York. The film is based on the book \"Vengeance\" by George Jonas, an account of the incident which has been criticized by some intelligence personnel as fictional, though because of its covert nature is difficult to prove or disprove. In some countries the book was titled \"Vengeance: Sword of Gideon\", from which the movie title is drawn. The story was retold in the 2005 film \"Munich\" by Steven Spielberg.\n\nAvner, an adept Israeli military officer is selected as the leader of a Mossad team of expert agents for a covert mission to avenge the Munich massacre and other recent attacks. They are initially successful in their assassinations but as they progress it becomes harder and harder to find their targets and they themselves are targeted with varying success by their enemies. With Avner and Jean the driver being the only survivors the mission is called off. He wishes to retire from Mossad and rejoin the regular ranks of the IDF, but his case officer is reluctant to let his most valuable asset go.\n\n\nThe film was released on VHS by HBO/Cannon Video under license from Home Box Office. However, HBO lost control of right the film and then in 2004 was released on DVD by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. Currently, the film belongs to Lionsgate Films.\n\n"}

The stadium is used for long track speed skating, short track speed skating, ice hockey, figure skating, ice speedway, and non-sports events. The outdoor rink was opened in 1967, and the indoor stadium was opened in 1986. Several world records were set in the indoor stadium. Annually, Thialf hosts two Speed Skating World Cup events. The arena has a capacity of 12,500 seats. Jan de Jong was the ice rink master at Thialf for many years.\n\nThialf is named after Thialfi, a character in Norse mythology, who was Thor's servant and had to race a giant.\n\nThe construction of the artificial outdoor ice rink was started in 1966 and it was opened on 14 October 1967 by Princess Christina of the Netherlands. It was the third 400m artificial ice rink in the Netherlands, after the Jaap Eden baan in Amsterdam and the IJsselstadion in Deventer. Several national and international tournaments were held in Thialf, but only one world record had been skated on the outdoor rink, by Andrea Schöne on the 5000 m in 1983.\n\nThe roofed stadium, which seats 12,500 people, opened on 17 November 1986, about a year after Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in Berlin, which was the first 400m indoor speed skating oval in the world. Thanks to the indoor conditions, allowing climate control, almost all world speed skating records were broken at Thialf in the first season. Since 1988 it has been overtaken as the \"fastest ice in the world\" by the high-altitude indoor rinks in Calgary and Salt Lake City, which have the additional benefit of low air pressure.\n\nEvery year there are main skating events like the Dutch, European and World championships, and one or two Speed Skating World Cup events in Thialf.\n\nThe 2500-seat ice hockey arena adjacent to the speed skating oval is the home arena of the Heerenveen Flyers, one of the Netherlands' most successful ice hockey clubs. It is also the main arena used in the Netherlands for international ice hockey tournaments, for example it host the IIHF World U18 Championships (Division II, Group A) in late March 2012.\n\nThe stadium was renovated in 2016.\n\n\n\n\nThese are the current track records in Thialf. \n\nThe following world records were set in Thialf.\n\nThe arena has hosted concerts by many famous artists, including Whitney Houston, Prince, André Rieu, TOTO, Trance Energy and Tina Turner, among others.\n\nAlso, the national Miss Universe competition was held in Thialf several times.\n\n"}

{"id": "1231228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1231228", "title": "Utility player", "text": "Utility player\n\nIn sports, a utility player is one who can play several positions competently. Sports in which the term is often used include football, baseball, rugby union, rugby league, water polo, and softball.\n\nThe term has gained prominence in all sports due to its use in fantasy leagues, but in rugby and rugby league, it is commonly used by commentators to recognize a player's versatility.\n\nIn football, like other sports, the utility man is usually a player who can play myriad positions. This will commonly be defence and midfield, sometimes defence and attack. A few outfield players have also made competent substitute goalkeepers, for example Phil Jagielka, Jan Koller (originally trained as a goalkeeper before converting into a striker) and Cosmin Moți. But in the case of goalkeepers playing as outfield players, it is extremely rare. Some may be free kick and penalty specialists (Rogério Ceni, José Luis Chilavert and Jorge Campos), but they do not hold a role in the outfield. John O'Shea, a former Manchester United player, is a famous example for playing in all positions in his United career. More recently, another Manchester United player, Phil Jones, has become a utility player being used as a right back, and centre back as well as taking up both defensive and more attacking midfield roles. The former Bulgarian international and Sporting Lisbon player Ivaylo Yordanov has played in all three outfield roles. Former Scottish international and Rangers captain Lee McCulloch also played in every outfield role for the club. Former Dutch international and Feyenoord, PSV Eindhoven and Milan player Ruud Gullit played as a defender, midfielder and striker, changing his position even within a single game to accommodate the gaps caused by substitutions.\n\nPerhaps an early example (though before the term gained popular usage) was England 1966 World Cup winner Martin Peters (who famously scored in that final), who played in every position- including briefly as goalkeeper- for West Ham United.\n\nIn baseball, a utility player is a player who can play several different positions. In general, each Major League Baseball team has at least one player who can be described as a utility player.\n\nMost professional teams have two types of utility players. There are \"utility infielders\", who usually play all of the infield positions (plus occasionally catcher). Utility outfielders, or fourth outfielders, tend to play all three outfield positions at various times. Occasionally, there will be players who perform a combination of the two duties. Utility players tend to be players who come off of the bench, though this is not absolute. Often, players who do not have high prospects to be a major league star will learn additional positions so they can look more attractive to major league clubs as bench talent.\n\nIn , the Detroit Tigers' Tony Phillips was the first player to start ten games at five different positions in the same season. César Tovar, Cookie Rojas, Bert Campaneris, Shane Halter, Don Kelly, Jose Oquendo and Scott Sheldon all played every position (including pitcher) during their respective careers, with Tovar, Camperanis, Halter and Sheldon all doing it in one game.\n\nIn Chone Figgins started 48 games at third, 45 in center field and 36 at second, and finished 17th in American League Most Valuable Player balloting. Ryan Theriot of the San Francisco Giants has played shortstop, third base, second and outfield at some point in his short major league career. Mark DeRosa for the Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Cardinals Atlanta Braves, and the San Francisco Giants has played most defensive positions. Former third baseman Brandon Inge has played third base, catcher, left field, right field, and center field. Second baseman Ben Zobrist of the Chicago Cubs has played first, third, second, shortstop and outfield, José Bautista of Toronto Blue Jays has played first base, second base, third base, and outfield, and Josh Harrison of the Pittsburgh Pirates has played second base, shortstop, third base, outfield, and pitcher. All three have been named All Stars while playing multiple positions in their All-Star seasons. In , Brock Holt of the Boston Red Sox was the first player ever to be selected to the All Star Game after starting at seven or more positions before the break. Zobrist and Bautista both finished in the top 10 in MVP voting while starting at least 40 games at two different defensive positions. Luis Sojo is considered to be the classic modern utility player in baseball, as he was a natural shortstop, but could also play 3rd base, 2nd base, 1st base, and even left field. It was said that in emergency situations, he could even play a bit of catcher.\n\nA third type of utility player is often seen in youth baseball, and occasionally in college baseball—a player talented enough as a pitcher and position player to play in both roles. The term \"utility player\" is not typically used to describe such an individual, with \"two-way player\" used instead. Two recent examples of two-way players in modern college baseball are A. J. Reed and Brendan McKay, both of whom were consensus national players of the year while playing regularly as first basemen and starting pitchers—Reed in 2014 with Kentucky and McKay in 2017 with Louisville. Both players would win the John Olerud Award as the best two-way college player, with McKay winning the award three times (the only player to win this award more than once). Reed would ultimately become exclusively a first baseman, while McKay is currently being developed in the minor leagues as a two-way player. \n\nEven more rarely, a player can have the talent to play both roles at the top professional level. Babe Ruth began his career as a pitcher, but proved to be such a strong hitter that he briefly alternated in the two roles until becoming a full-time position player. A current example is Shohei Ohtani, who made the Best Nine of Japan's Pacific League as both a pitcher and a hitter in 2016, and is a designated hitter / starting pitcher for the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe term \"utility player\" is rarely used in basketball outside of fantasy basketball leagues. Instead; basketball uses the terms tweener and swingman to refer to a player who can play two or three different positions, with more specific terms being combo guard, forward-center, and stretch four.\n\nIn ice hockey, it is common for centres and wingers to play either position in certain situations. Depending on need, a team may use a natural centreman on the wing if they have too many centres or, conversely, a winger may be pressed to play centre because of a lack of suitable players in that area. Because of the frequency of forwards playing both positions, the term utility player tends to refer not to a player that plays more than one forward position, but to a player that can play both defence and forward. Teams may use a defenceman as a forward, or vice versa, for a variety of reasons.\n\nSometimes a natural defenceman who struggles on the defensive side of the game but possesses strong offensive qualities may be used as a winger. Marc-Andre Bergeron and Kurtis Foster, for example, have proven to be quality offensive defencemen who struggle in defending their own zone. As such, they have dressed as forwards so their teams can continue to use their offensive abilities on the powerplay while still using the standard six defencemen during even strength.\n\nAn extra defenceman may also be pressed to play forward in an emergency situation, where a team has a rash of injuries to their forwards and do not have time to summon a replacement player from a farm team.\n\nIt is very common for teams to use a forward on \"the point\" during the powerplay to provide a greater offensive threat. Though the forward is playing defence in this situation, they aren't necessarily seen as true utility players.\n\nAlong with Bergeron and Foster, other notable defencemen that have played forward at some point in their careers include Phil Housley, Brent Burns, Mark Streit, Christoph Schubert, Ian White and Chris Campoli. Notable forwards who have played defence include Sergei Fedorov, Mathieu Dandenault, Brooks Laich and Sami Kapanen.\n\nIn some cases a player has made a full-time conversion from one position to the other and experienced success. Hockey Hall of Famer Red Kelly spent the first half of his career as an offensive defenceman for the Detroit Red Wings before finishing his career as a strong two-way centreman for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Wendel Clark was a star defenceman in junior before converting to left wing and scoring over 300 goals and 500 points in 15 NHL seasons. (Some junior hockey teams have a tendency to put their best offensive players on defence instead of as forwards, since defencemen generally have more time on the ice.) Dustin Byfuglien is an example of a current player who has made the switch from forward to defence full-time. Jonathan Ericsson of the Detroit Red Wings is another example of a player who converted from forward to defense.\n\nIt is extremely rare for goaltenders to play any position other than goaltender; likewise, it is just as rare for non-goaltenders to suit up in goal, because of the significant difference in skills and equipment required for the position.\n\nIn gridiron football, the utility player is often capable of playing multiple positions, and often they may play both offense and defense. The concept was far more common in the early days of football, when pro teams used their best athletes as many ways as possible, and substitutions were far more restricted, meaning players had to stay on the field for offense, defense and \"special teams\". This was known as the one-platoon system.\n\nThe triple threat man, who could run, pass and kick, was particularly popular during the early days of football from the time the forward pass was invented to the World War II era (see, for instance, Bradbury Robinson, Tommy Hughitt, Sammy Baugh and, during his college years, Johnny Unitas). Most levels of football lifted the substitution restrictions during the post-World War II era in the late 1940s, beginning with \"platooning\" (use of different offensive and defensive units) and eventually transitioning to complete free substitution. Chuck Bednarik, a center and linebacker, was the last full-time two way player in the NFL, having retired in 1962. Despite this, the American Football League of the 1960s frequently used players at multiple positions, particularly kickers and punters (e.g. George Blanda, Paul Maguire, Cookie Gilchrist, Gino Cappelletti, and Gene Mingo, a running back who became the first black placekicker in modern professional football, among others). Because of increased injury risk awareness, since the AFL-NFL merger these types of players are increasingly rare, and true utility players usually end up specializing in one position (for example, Lane Johnson played quarterback, tight end, defensive end and offensive tackle through college but was tagged specifically at offensive tackle when drafted into the NFL). Those that do play multiple positions for any extended period of time are mostly backups (e.g. Guido Merkens, Brad Smith and Joe Webb) or career minor-league players (e.g. Don Jonas, Eric Crouch and Charles Puleri). It is still very common in smaller high schools to see top players play two or even three ways (offense, defense and special teams), in multiple positions, but in college and pro ball, where rosters are larger and the talent pool is more elite, the injury risk outweighs potential benefits.\n\nIn the National Football League, Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots uses the utility player frequently. For instance, Doug Flutie, as a former member of the Patriots, famously switched from quarterback to kicker for one extra-point play in 2006, to deliver the first drop kick in the NFL in sixty years. Belichick has also used his linebackers, including Bryan Cox and Mike Vrabel, as H-backs on offense, and doubled his wide receivers (e.g. Troy Brown and Randy Moss) as cornerbacks and safeties. Additionally, Houston Texans defensive end J. J. Watt lined up at tight end in special goal-line packages in 2014, catching three touchdown passes. The 6' 5\" Watt played tight end in high school before becoming a full-time defensive player.\n\nThe tackle eligible is a special form of utility player; examples of those who used this play notably include Jason Peters, Warren Sapp, Jumbo Elliott, William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry, Mitch Frerotte and Anthony Muñoz. Another example of a type of utility player is the halfback option play, in which a running back performs the passing duties of a quarterback; Walter Payton, LaDanian Tomlinson and most recently Ronnie Brown have used this play multiple times, and this type of play has spawned an entire offensive scheme. Note that generally, a player who plays one regular position as well as special teams is \"usually\" not considered a utility player, nor are hybrid running back/wide receivers such as Reggie Bush; only those who play two distinct offensive and/or defensive positions are considered such, as are those who play an offensive or defensive position and in addition kick or punt.\n\nThe \"offense/offensive weapon\" (also known as OW) is an offensive player that can play multiple different positions. The OW role contains, but is not limited too, players that can play quarterback, running back, tight end, and wide receiver. Kordell Stewart was the first player to be used in this role back in the 1990s, but it became popular in the early 2010s. Back when Stewart played this role, it was known as the \"Slash\" role. The Jacksonville Jaguars' OW Denard Robinson was the first to be officially an OW but other current examples of the OW position include Carolina Panthers Quarterback Joe Webb (has started at WR in the NFL) Minnesota Vikings Tight End and Fullback MarQueis Gray (who started at QB and WR at the University of Minnesota), and New Orleans Saints quarterback Taysom Hill.\n\nThe Arena Football League, for many years, made almost all of its players, with the exception of two players on each side (always a quarterback, a kicker {the quarterback and kicker were never on the field at the same time} and usually a wide receiver and two defensive backs), play both sides of the ball; this was known as \"ironman.\" The \"ironman\" concept was dropped in 2007.\n\nWith the exception of the now defunct NFL Europe almost all European American Football leagues have players that play offense defense and special teams. Especially when the number of \"American\" players is limited they are often on the field for as many snaps as possible both on offense and defense\n\nThe use of utility in rugby league is more expansive because not only would a player play only at backs' (or forwards') positions, some may play in forward and back positions with similar roles (e.g. halfback/hooker), or even play so many different positions as injury cover. Lance Hohaia is a prime example of this as he played in six different positions in his NRL career.\n\nUtility player is a term used mostly in New Zealand. In rugby union, it comes in a form of utility back. It is mostly a back who can cover at least two positions. Notable examples in New Zealand include Daniel Bowden, Luke McAlister and Cory Jane, but Australia also has many utility backs like Adam Ashley-Cooper, Kurtley Beale and Matt Giteau. A South African example is François Steyn.\n\nDespite that, there are forwards who are capable of covering multiple positions. Many players in the back row of the scrum (flankers and number eights) will frequently switch between the two positions. Notable players in English rugby have made the transition between back row to the back line as they possess transferrable skills & are usually the quicker & more mobile of the pack, less often a player may also be capable of playing lock as well as a back-row position, with several modern examples being Sébastien Chabal, Steven Luatua, Kieran Read, and Maro Itoje, all with international caps in both rows of the scrum. However, this description never applies to props who can play both ends of the front row (i.e. Numbers 1 & 3), unless the player has the ability to cover as a hooker (e.g. John Afoa, a prop who could cover as a hooker, or John Smit, primarily a hooker but also capped internationally at both prop positions).\n\nIn fantasy baseball and basketball, a utility player is a player (specifically a batter in baseball) who accumulates statistics without being assigned to a particular position. The batter can play any position; he need not actually be a utility player (for example, if a fantasy manager has two first baseman, he can assign one to the first base position and one to a utility slot). Similarly, a person assigned a utility slot in fantasy basketball need not be a tweener or swingman.\n"}
