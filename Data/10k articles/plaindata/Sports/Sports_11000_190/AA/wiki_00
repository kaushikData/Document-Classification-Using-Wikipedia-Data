The title was won by Bruce Wilhelm from the United States. It was his first title. Bob Young from the United States finished second, and Ken Patera also from the United States third.\n\nOriginally commissioned by Trans World International for CBS, the concept for the World's Strongest Man event came from Scots David P. Webster and Douglas Edmunds. Webster had earned himself a name as an event organiser through his involvement with the Highland games, while Edmunds had experience in professional shot put, discus, and caber tossing. The event was mostly developed for entertainment purposes. \n\nWith no precedent for a worldwide 'Strongman' competition, the concept of a strongman competitor and event was new, and as such, the competitors came from a wide range of existing disciplines, including American football, powerlifting and track and field. This meant that none of the competitors had ever trained for the events taking place during the competition.\n\nIn addition, several of the events in which the athletes competed were poorly thought out or dangerous, as evidenced when Italian Franco Columbu fell during the penultimate event, the Fridge Race, dislocating his knee, forcing him to retire and putting him out of action for three years. The fridge carry was not reintroduced to the competition until 2004, with a crossbar added to stabilise two fridges on either side of the athlete. \n\nQualification to the event was by invite only 'on the recommendation of experts.'\n\n"}

The predecessor competition was the Serbia and Montenegro Cup until that state dissolved. Heavy favorites Red Star defeated Vojvodina to win the tournament and become Serbia's first cup winner and later clinched the Meridian SuperLiga title to claim its tenth domestic double.\n\nThe Final was held at Partizan's Stadium on May 15, 2007 in Belgrade, Serbia.

The official seating capacity is 6,150.\n\nThe park was built for the 1994 season, although it opened several weeks late due to a rough winter that hampered construction. The sod also was unable to take properly that season, and the field did not properly drain, leading to rainouts on evenings where the sun had been out since noon. The drainage problem was fixed in 1995.\n\nThe stadium's original name was \"Mercer County Waterfront Park\" when it opened in 1994. \"Samuel J. Plumeri, Sr. Field\" was added to the original name in 1999 by Trenton Thunder owner, Joe Plumeri (Chairman and CEO of Willis Group Holdings). Samuel J. Plumeri, Sr. was Joe Plumeri's father. In November 2012, the New Jersey-based Arm & Hammer purchased the ballpark's naming rights and will maintain its sponsorship through 2032.\n\nIn June 2014, the park hosted the first-ever, gold– and bronze–medal games in baseball for the Special Olympics USA National Games.

Its headquarters are in Lausanne (Switzerland) and its courts are located in New York City, Sydney and Lausanne. Temporary courts are established in current Olympic host cities.\n\nGenerally speaking, a dispute may be submitted to the CAS only if there is an arbitration agreement between the parties which specifies recourse to the CAS. However, according to rule 61 of the Olympic Charter, all disputes in connection with the Olympic Games can only be submitted to CAS, and all Olympic International Federations (IF) have recognised the jurisdiction of CAS for at least some disputes.\n\nThrough compliance with the 2009 World Anti-Doping Code, all signatories, including all Olympic International Federations and National Olympic Committees, have recognised the jurisdiction of CAS for anti-doping rule violations. Starting in 2016, an anti-doping division of CAS judges doping cases at the Olympic Games, replacing the IOC disciplinary commission. These decisions can be appealed to CAS's ad hoc court in the Olympic host city or, if the ad hoc court is no longer available, to the permanent CAS. The inaugural anti-doping division handled eight cases, of which seven were doping cases within its jurisdiction.\n\nAs a Swiss arbitration organization, decisions of the CAS can be appealed to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. Appeals of arbitration decisions are generally not successful, and no evaluation of the merits is taking place and the evaluation is mainly based on whether procedural requirements have been met, and whether the award is incompatible with public policy. there have been seven successful appeals. Six of the upheld appeals were procedural in nature, and only once has the Federal Supreme Court overruled a CAS decision on the merits of the case. This was in the case of Matuzalém, a Brazilian football player.\n\nThe Federal Court of Justice of Germany ruled against the German speed-skater Claudia Pechstein, recognising a lack of jurisdiction to revisit her case. The Federal Court ruled that CAS met the requirements of a court of arbitration according to German law, and that CAS's independence from the parties was secured by the method of selecting arbitrators and the possibility to appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal.\n\nWith the intermixing of sports and politics, the body was originally conceived by International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch to deal with disputes arising during the Olympics. It was established as part of the IOC in 1984.\n\nIn 1992, the case of \"Gundel v. La Fédération Equestre Internationale\" was decided by the CAS, and then appealed to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, challenging CAS impartiality. The Swiss court ruled that the CAS was a true court of arbitration but drew attention to the numerous links between the CAS and the IOC.\n\nIn response, the CAS underwent reforms to make itself more independent of the IOC, both organizationally and financially. The biggest change resulting from this reform was the creation of an \"International Council of Arbitration for Sport\" (ICAS) to look after the running and financing of the CAS, thereby taking the place of the IOC. , most recent cases that were considered by the CAS dealt with transfer disputes within professional association football or with doping.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport is planning to move its headquarters from the Château de Béthusy to the south part of the Palais de Beaulieu (both in Lausanne).\n\nIt is noteworthy that CAS had already issued an award suspending an athlete based on the longitudinal profiling of the biological markers before the adoption of the ABP by the IFs [international federations]: in CAS 2009/A/1912 & 1913 [Pechstein], the Panel suspended an Olympic athlete after the biological data showed irregular blood values. According to CAS, those abnormal values were not caused by an error occurred in a laboratory, as the athlete asserted, but due to the banned manipulation of the athlete’s blood. The essential difference between ABP judgments and the CAS 2009/A/1912 & 1913 consists in that in the latter case the athlete’s blood data was drawn from a sample the athlete gave at the federations championships and therefore not from data gathered by an official systematic program run by the athlete’s union.\n\n\nThe ad hoc court for the 2016 Olympics had registered 18 cases by 3 August, surpassing the record two days before the Opening Ceremony. 11 of the cases were related to the various bans on Russian athletes related to the allegations of state-sponsored doping documented in the McLaren report. By the end of the Games the total number of cases was 28, 16 of which were related to the eligibility of Russian athletes.\n\n\n"}

It annually hosts the Snake River Stampede, considered one of the nation's top rodeos, during the third week in July. The Stampede moved indoors to the Ford Arena in 1997; it was formerly held in an outdoor stadium (now demolished) near Lakeview Park. Since 1999, the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) has hosted a Built Ford Tough Series (originally Bud Light Cup) event at the Ford Idaho Center in what has been a major stop of the tour.\n\nFord Arena is used for concerts, trade shows, sporting events, and other events.

{"id": "345802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=345802", "title": "John Cena", "text": "John Cena\n\nJohn Felix Anthony Cena Jr. (; born April 23, 1977) is an American professional wrestler, actor, rapper, and television host. He is currently signed to WWE, where he appears for both the Raw and SmackDown brands.\n\nCena gained fame in the WWE in the early 2000s, portraying a trash-talking rapper. This success promoted Cena to act as the company's franchise player and its public face, which later prompted a transition to his current character, which he describes as a \"goody-two shoes Superman\". Under his current incarnation, Cena has attained mainstream fame, and has won 25 championships throughout his career, with 16 reigns as a world champion. His 16 world title wins are tied with Ric Flair's, per WWE records. Cena is a five-time United States Champion and a four-time world tag team champion. He is also a Money in the Bank ladder match winner (2012), a two-time Royal Rumble winner (2008, 2013), and a three-time Superstar of the Year Slammy Award winner (2009, 2010, 2012). He has also headlined WWE's flagship event WrestleMania on five occasions (2006, 2007, 2011, 2012, and 2013) as well as many other WWE pay-per-views. Despite his success, Cena's character is met with mixed critical reception, and he is considered one of the most polarizing professional wrestlers ever.\n\nOutside of wrestling, Cena released the album \"You Can't See Me\" (2005), which gained platinum certification in the United States. Cena has also enjoyed success as an actor, starring in \"The Marine\" (2006), \"12 Rounds\" (2009), \"Legendary\" (2010), \"The Reunion\" (2011), \"Trainwreck\" (2015), \"The Wall\" (2017), \"Ferdinand\" (2017), and \"\" (2018). He has also made several guest appearances on television, and was the host of the reality show \"American Grit\".\n\nCena is also known for his involvement in numerous philanthropic causes, namely the Make-A-Wish Foundation, where he has granted more than 500 wishes, the most in Make-A-Wish history.\n\nJohn Felix Anthony Cena Jr. was born on April 23, 1977, in West Newbury, Massachusetts to Carol (\"née\" Lupien) and John Felix Anthony Cena. He has an older brother (Stephen) and three younger brothers (Dan, Matt, and Sean). His maternal grandfather was baseball player Tony Lupien. He is of English, French-Canadian, and Italian ancestry. Raised Catholic, he attended Central Catholic High School in Lawrence, Massachusetts before transferring to Cushing Academy, a private prep boarding school in Ashburnham, Massachusetts. He then attended Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts. In college, he was a NCAA Division III All-American center on the college football team and wore the number 54, which is still used on some of his WWE merchandise. Cena graduated from Springfield College in 1998 with a degree in exercise physiology and body movement, after which he pursued a career in bodybuilding and worked as a limousine driver.\n\nCena started training to become a professional wrestler in 1999 at Ultimate Pro Wrestling's (UPW) California-based Ultimate University operated by Rick Bassman. Once he was placed into an in-ring role, Cena began using a semi-robotic character known as The Prototype. Some of this period of his career was documented in the Discovery Channel program \"Inside Pro Wrestling School\". He held the UPW Heavyweight Championship for 27 days in April 2000. Cena wrestled for the UPW until March 2001.\n\nOn October 10, 2000, while billed as The Prototype, Cena made his unofficial debut for the then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on a \"SmackDown\" taping in a dark match against Mikey Richardson, which he lost. He received another tryout on January 9, 2001, at a \"SmackDown\" taping in Oakland, California, this time defeating Aaron Aguilera. Cena wrestled again in a dark match at a \"SmackDown\" taping on March 13.\n\nIn 2001, Cena signed a developmental contract with the WWF and was assigned to its developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). During his time there, Cena wrestled under the ring name The Prototype and held the OVW Heavyweight Championship for three months and the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship (with Rico Constantino) for two months. Throughout 2001, Cena would receive four tryouts for the WWF main roster, as he wrestled multiple enhancement talent wrestlers on both WWF house shows and in dark matches before WWF television events. Through the early months of 2002, Cena constantly found himself competing on house shows for the WWF, where he wrestled against the likes of Shelton Benjamin and Tommy Dreamer.\n\nAfter his main roster call up in June 2002, Cena would continue to appear on OVW programming until the September 25 taping of OVW, where he lost to Kenny Brolin in a Loser Leaves OVW match. Cena would appear in a one-off appearance for the developmental farm in November under the ring name Mr. P in a six-man tag team match, where he teamed with future WWE Hall of Famer Big Boss Man and Charlie Haas in a winning effort against Lance Cade, Trevor Murdoch and Sean O'Haire.\n\nOn the June 24 episode of \"Raw\", Mr. McMahon ordered the entire roster to the ring and declared that he needed them to all find some ruthless aggression from within themselves and that he was looking for one of them to stand out from the rest of the pack. Cena made his WWE television debut on the June 27, 2002, episode of \"SmackDown\" by answering an open challenge by Kurt Angle. After declaring that he possessed \"ruthless aggression\", Cena lost by a pinning combination. After the match, Cena was congratulated by Billy Kidman, Faarooq, Rikishi, and The Undertaker. Following the near-win, Cena became a fan favorite and started feuding with Chris Jericho, defeating Jericho at Vengeance. Then, Cena feuded with Los Guerreros (Chavo and Eddie Guerrero) and Cena picked up a victory over Chavo Guerrero on the September 3, 2002, taping of \"Velocity\". On the September 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", Cena teamed with Edge in a losing effort against Los Guerreros, thus ending the feud in the process. Cena went on to defeat the likes of Albert and D-Von Dudley as he was restricted to appearances on \"Velocity\" for the rest of September.\n\nIn October 2002, Cena and Billy Kidman took part in a tag team tournament to crown the first WWE Tag Team Champions of the SmackDown brand, losing in the first round. The next week on \"SmackDown\", Cena turned on and attacked Kidman, blaming him for their loss, becoming a villain for the first and only time in his career. On the October 17 episode of \"SmackDown\", Cena defeated Kidman in a singles contest, but was defeated by Kidman in a rematch on the October 24 episode of \"SmackDown\".\n\nShortly after the Kidman attack on a Halloween themed episode of \"SmackDown\", Cena dressed as Vanilla Ice performing a freestyle rap. The following week on \"SmackDown\", Cena received a new character: a rapper who cut promos while rhyming. As the gimmick grew, Cena began adopting a variant of the 1980s WWF logo – dropping the \"F\" – as his \"signature symbol\", along with the slogan \" Life\". At Rebellion, Cena would team with Dawn Marie in a losing effort against Kidman and Torrie Wilson in a mixed tag team match.\n\nEventually, Cena was joined by an enforcer, Bull Buchanan, who was rechristened B-2 (also written B² and pronounced \"B-Squared\"). B-2 helped Cena kick off 2003 in victorious fashion with a win over Rikishi on the January 2 episode of \"SmackDown\" and a win over Chavo Guerrero on the January 9 episode of \"SmackDown\". Both Cena and B-2 participated in the 2003 Royal Rumble match, but were unsuccessful. Cena and B-2 failed to capture the WWE Tag Team Championship from Los Guerreros, resulting in Cena replacing B-2 with Red Dogg until he was sent to the Raw brand in February 2003.\n\nFor the first half of 2003, Cena sought the WWE Championship and chased the reigning champion Brock Lesnar after WrestleMania XIX, gaining upset wins over Eddie Guerrero, The Undertaker and Chris Benoit, who mocked him by wearing a \"Toothless Aggression\" shirt. Cena won a number one contender's tournament for the right to face off against Lesnar for the WWE Championship at Backlash, but he failed to win the title at the event. After Backlash, Cena entered into a feud with Rhyno and Chris Benoit, which led to Cena, along with Chuck Palumbo and Johnny Stamboli, defeating the team of Spanky, Rhyno and Benoit at Judgment Day. Shortly thereafter, Cena began mocking The Undertaker before and after his matches leading to a match between the two at Vengeance, where he lost a singles match against The Undertaker.\n\nIn a rematch between the two, Cena would once again defeat The Undertaker on the August 5 episode of \"SmackDown\", this time with assistance from A-Train. The feud between the two came to an end on the August 19 episode of \"SmackDown\", when Cena and A-Train defeated Undertaker and Orlando Jordan in a tag team match. Cena then pursued the United States Championship, but lost to then champion Eddie Guerrero in a Latino Street Fight for the title.\nAfter losing to Kurt Angle at No Mercy, Cena became a fan favorite (of which he's remained since) when he joined Angle as a member of his team at Survivor Series, where Cena and Chris Benoit were the survivors. Despite feuding, Cena and Benoit would later join forces as a makeshift tag team and on the November 27 episode of \"SmackDown\" both won a 20-man battle royal to earn a WWE Championship match when, after being the last two men remaining, they would eliminate each other at the same time and were both declared joint winners of the match. However, Benoit defeated Cena the following week on \"SmackDown\" to earn a WWE Championship match against Lesnar that same night.\n\nIn early 2004, Cena participated in the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble, making it to the final six before being eliminated by Big Show. Chris Benoit was the eventual winner of the match. The Royal Rumble elimination led to a feud with Big Show. At No Way Out, Cena faced Big Show and Kurt Angle in a triple threat match for a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania XX, which Cena lost by submission to Angle. Cena won his first singles championship in WWE, the United States Championship from Big Show at WrestleMania XX. He held the title for four months with successful defenses against the likes of Rene Dupree, Rob Van Dam and Booker T, until he was stripped of the title on the July 8 episode of \"SmackDown\" by Angle after he accidentally knocked him over, thus attacking an official. Cena won the championship back defeating Booker T in a best of five series that culminated at No Mercy, only to drop it to the débuting Carlito Caribbean Cool the following week on \"SmackDown\". After the loss to Carlito, the duo began a feud, which resulted in Cena allegedly being stabbed in the kidney while at a Boston-area nightclub by Carlito's bodyguard, Jesús. This worked injury was used to keep Cena out of action for a month while Cena was filming \"The Marine\". Immediately on his return in November, Cena won the United States Championship back from Carlito. Cena later successfully defended the championship against Jesus at Armageddon in a street fight match.\n\nCena took part in the 2005 Royal Rumble match, making it to the final two along with Batista until both went over the top rope at the same time, ostensibly ending the match, which was restarted and won by Batista. The next month, Cena then participated in a number one contender's tournament for the WWE Championship and made to the finals at No Way Out, where he defeated Kurt Angle to earn a spot in the SmackDown brand's WrestleMania 21 main event match, beginning a feud with then WWE Champion John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and his Cabinet in the process. In the early stages of the feud, Cena lost the United States Championship to Cabinet member Orlando Jordan after JBL interfered and hit Cena with his title belt.\n\nCena defeated JBL at WrestleMania to win the WWE Championship, giving Cena his first world championship. Cena then had a spinner WWE Championship belt made, while JBL took the original title belt and claimed to still be WWE Champion, until Cena reclaimed the original championship belt in an \"I Quit\" match at Judgment Day.\nCena was drafted to the Raw brand on June 6, 2005, taking his title with him and became the first wrestler selected in the annual draft lottery. Cena immediately entered a feud with Eric Bischoff, after refusing to participate in the \"war\" against the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) roster at One Night Stand. At Vengeance, Cena made his first successful title defense since coming to \"Raw\", defeating Christian and Chris Jericho in a triple threat match. With Bischoff vowing to make Cena's stint on Raw difficult, he hand picked Jericho to take Cena's championship from him. During their feud, even though Cena was portrayed as the \"face\" (hero) and Jericho as the \"heel\" (villain), a vocal section of live crowds, nonetheless, were cheering Jericho during their matches. Crowds started to heavily boo Cena during his next feud with Kurt Angle, who took over as Bischoff's hand-picked number-one contender after Cena defeated Jericho in a You're Fired match on the August 22 \"Raw\". Cena held on to the WWE Championship through his feud with Angle, losing to him by disqualification at Unforgiven, pinning Shawn Michaels in a triple threat match involving Angle at Taboo Tuesday, and pinning Angle at Survivor Series. The feud with Angle also saw Cena add a secondary, submission based, finishing maneuver – the \"STFU\" (a stepover toehold sleeper, though named for a stepover toehold facelock) – when he was put into a triple threat submissions only match on the November 28 episode of \"Raw\".\nAt New Year's Revolution, Cena participated in the main event Elimination Chamber match where he retained the WWE Championship when he last eliminated Carlito. Immediately after a bloodied Cena won, Edge made his way to the ring to cash in his Money in the Bank contract – a \"guaranteed title match against the WWE Champion at a time and place of the owner's choosing\". Two quick spears allowed Edge to pin Cena and win the championship. Three weeks later, Cena won the championship back at the Royal Rumble. After that, Cena began feuding with Triple H, in which the crowd again started booing Cena and cheering the intended villain, Triple H, after being mostly cheered the last few months. Cena beat Triple H at WrestleMania 22 to retain the WWE Championship. The negative reaction towards Cena intensified when facing Rob Van Dam at One Night Stand. Taking place in front of a boisterous crowd of mostly original ECW fans at the Hammerstein Ballroom, Cena was met with raucous jeering and chants of \"Fuck you, Cena\", \"You can't wrestle\", and \"Same old shit\". When he began performing different moves into the match, the fans began chanting \"You still suck\". Cena lost the WWE Championship to Van Dam at One Night Stand after interference from Edge.\nIn July, Edge won the championship from Van Dam in a triple threat match that also involved Cena, re-igniting the feud between him and Cena from earlier in the year. After Edge went about retaining the title by dubious means—getting himself disqualified (for which championships do not change hands) and using brass knuckles—he introduced his own version of Cena's \"custom\" title belt, this one with his logo placed on the spinner. Cena eventually won the championship back in a match and arena of Edge's choice: a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match at Unforgiven at the Air Canada Centre in Edge's hometown of Toronto, Ontario, Canada after performing the \"FU\" on Edge through two tables off a ladder. The match had a stipulation that, had Cena lost, he would have left the Raw brand for SmackDown. Cena returned his version of the spinner title belt on the next night's \"Raw\".\n\nOn the heels of his feud with Edge, Cena was placed in an inter-brand angle to determine the \"Champion of Champions\" – or which was the most dominant champion in WWE's three brands. Cena, the World Heavyweight Champion King Booker, and the ECW World Champion Big Show engaged in a mini-feud leading to a triple threat match at Cyber Sunday, with the viewers voting on which of the three championships would be placed on the line. At the same time, Cena became involved in a storyline with non-wrestler Kevin Federline, when he began appearing on \"Raw\" with Johnny Nitro and Melina. After getting into a worked physical altercation with Federline on \"Raw\", Federline appeared at Cyber Sunday to hit Cena with the World Heavyweight Championship during the match, helping King Booker retain his championship. 2006 ended with Cena beginning a feud with the undefeated Umaga over the WWE Championship, while 2007 began with the end of his storyline with Kevin Federline. On the first \"Raw\" of the new year, Cena was pinned by Federline with an assist from Umaga, although later in the night he was able to get his hands on Federline performing an \"FU\" on him. At the pay-per-view event, New Year's Revolution, Cena defeated Umaga to end his undefeated streak and retain the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble, Cena defeated Umaga in a Last Man Standing match to retain the title after Umaga was unable to get to his feet before the referee's ten count.\n\nOne night after the Royal Rumble, an impromptu team of Cena and Shawn Michaels defeated Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton) for the World Tag Team Championship, making Cena a double champion. At WrestleMania 23, Cena defeated Michales to retain the WWE Championship after forcing him to submit to the STFU.\n\nThe next night on \"Raw\", Michaels turned on Cena, costing them the championship in the second of two 10-team battles royals, by throwing Cena over the top rope and eliminating the team. The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) eventually won the match and the championship. For the rest of the month, Cena feuded with Michaels, Orton, and Edge until The Great Khali declared his intentions to challenge for Cena's championship attacking and \"laying out\" all three of the top contenders before assaulting Cena himself and stealing the physical title belt. For the next two months, Cena feuded with Khali over the championship, eventually becoming the first person in WWE to defeat him by submission at Judgment Day and then by pinfall at One Night Stand. Later that summer, Randy Orton was named the number one contender for the WWE Championship, starting a feud between the two. Leading up to SummerSlam, Orton delivered a number of sneak-attacks, performing three \"RKOs\" to Cena, who in the actual match retained the championship. A rematch between the two occurred at Unforgiven, with Orton winning by disqualification after Cena ignored the referee's instructions and continued to beat on him in the corner.\n\nDuring a match with Mr. Kennedy on the October 1, 2007, episode of \"Raw\", Cena suffered a legitimate torn pectoral muscle while executing a hip toss. Though finishing the match and taking part in the scripted attack by Orton after the match, surgery the following day found that his pectoralis major muscle was torn completely from the bone, estimating at the time to require seven months to a year of rehabilitation. As a result, Cena was stripped of the title by Mr. McMahon on the next night's episode of \"ECW\", ending what was the longest WWE Championship reign in over 19 years. Cena's surgery was performed by orthopedic surgeon James Andrews at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Two weeks later in a video update on WWE.com, Dr. Andrews and Cena's physical trainer both said that he was several weeks ahead of where he was expected to be in his rehabilitation at that time. Despite his injury, Cena attended the annual WWE's \"Tribute to the Troops\" show filmed at Camp Speicher in Tikrit, Iraq on December 7, and aired on December 24.\n\nCena made a surprise return as the final participant of the Royal Rumble match, winning the match, and the traditional WrestleMania title shot, by last eliminating Triple H. Instead of waiting until WrestleMania, the title shot was cashed in against then WWE Champion Randy Orton at February's No Way Out pay-per-view in a match where Cena won by disqualification, resulting in him not getting the championship. The following night on \"Raw\", Cena was placed back into WrestleMania XXIV's WWE Championship match by defeating Orton in a non-title match with Triple H as special guest referee, making it a triple threat match between the three men, during which he was pinned by Orton. At Backlash, Cena failed to regain the title in a fatal four-way elimination match, in which he was eliminated by Orton. During that match, Cena eliminated JBL, renewing their feud from 2005. Cena defeated JBL at Judgment Day and then at One Night Stand in a First Blood match. However, JBL defeated him in a New York City Parking Lot Brawl at The Great American Bash in July to end the feud. Cena also failed to regain the WWE Championship from Triple H at Night of Champions.\n\nOn the August 4 episode of \"Raw\", Cena became a World Tag Team Champion for a second time, teaming with Batista to defeat Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, but failed to retain the championship the following week against the former champions. Cena lost to Batista at SummerSlam. Shortly after, Cena was named one of four contenders for CM Punk's World Heavyweight Championship in the Championship Scramble match at Unforgiven, but he was replaced by Rey Mysterio after suffering a herniated disc in his neck, which required surgery. Cena underwent successful surgery to repair the injury.\n\nCena made his in-ring return at the November's Survivor Series pay-per-view event, defeating Chris Jericho to win his first World Heavyweight Championship. The two continued their rivalry up to Armageddon, where Cena retained his championship. After defeating JBL at the Royal Rumble, Cena lost the championship at No Way Out to Edge, who attacked Kofi Kingston and took his place in the Elimination Chamber match. Cena received his rematch for the title at WrestleMania XXV in a triple threat match also involving Big Show, which Cena won.\n\nCena lost the championship back to Edge in a Last Man Standing match at Backlash after interference from Big Show, who chokeslammed Cena through a big spotlight. This resulted in Cena beginning a feud with Big Show in which Cena defeated Big Show at Judgment Day and at Extreme Rules in a submission match by applying the \"STFU\". During Cena's feud with Big Show, The Miz challenged him to a match on the April 27 episode of \"Raw\", but as Cena was out due to injury, Miz claimed an unofficial win via forfeit and continued to do this over the following weeks, until Cena defeated him in a singles match at The Bash.\nAt Night of Champions in July, Cena challenged for the WWE Championship in a triple threat match against Triple H and defending champion Randy Orton (a rematch from WrestleMania XXIV), but was pinned by Orton after interference from Orton's protèges Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase. The next night, Cena won a beat the clock challenge to earn another shot at the WWE Championship at SummerSlam, where Orton would use several underhanded tactics to retain his title. A month later at Breaking Point, Cena defeated Orton in an \"I Quit\" match to win his fourth WWE Championship, but lost the title back to Orton in a Hell in a Cell match at the eponymous event. Three weeks later at Bragging Rights, Cena defeated Orton in a 60-minute Iron Man match to regain the championship. Cena successfully defended the title against both Triple H and Shawn Michaels in a triple threat match at Survivor Series, but lost it to Sheamus at in a tables match. The next night, Cena competed in a tournament to crown the 2009 Superstar of the Year, defeating CM Punk in the first round and Orton in the finals later that night to win the honor. He would get his rematch for the WWE Championship against Sheamus on the final \"Raw\" of 2009, where he won by disqualification, but did not win the championship. While Cena regained the title at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view in an Elimination Chamber match, his reign was cut short after Mr. McMahon immediately made him defend the title against Batista, who won the title. Cena defeated Batista at WrestleMania XXVI for the title and successfully defended it at Extreme Rules, in a Last Man Standing rematch. Cena faced Batista one more time, winning an \"I Quit\" match at Over the Limit, thus ending their long-time feud.\n\nOn the June 7 episode of \"Raw\", Cena was suddenly thrust into a new storyline when during his main event match against CM Punk, he was attacked by all eight former contestants of the first season of \"NXT\", with Wade Barrett as their leader. Punk, his follower Luke Gallows and other personnel around the ring were attacked as well, but Cena took the worst of the attack and was carried out on a stretcher. This group later referred to itself as The Nexus. At Fatal 4-Way, Cena lost the WWE Championship to Sheamus in a fatal four-way match involving Edge and Randy Orton after The Nexus interfered. Cena lost to Sheamus in a steel cage match at Money in the Bank after The Nexus again interfered. In retaliation to The Nexus, Cena formed an alliance with Edge, Chris Jericho, John Morrison, R-Truth, The Great Khali and Bret Hart. They defeated The Nexus at SummerSlam with help from the returning Daniel Bryan, a former member of Nexus, who replaced Khali after he was injured.\n\nHoping to end The Nexus, Cena challenged Wade Barrett to a match at Hell in a Cell with the stipulations that if he were to lose, he would join The Nexus. After Barrett defeated Cena, he joined The Nexus, and was forced by the anonymous \"Raw\" general manager to follow their orders or be fired. Cena and fellow Nexus member David Otunga defeated Cody Rhodes and Drew McIntyre to win the WWE Tag Team Championship at Bragging Rights. Later that night, he was forced to help Barrett defeat Orton in a WWE Championship match, giving Barrett the disqualification win, but not the title. The following night on \"Raw\", Cena and Otunga lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to fellow Nexus members Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel, when Barrett ordered Otunga to lay down and lose the title. At Survivor Series, Cena officiated a match for the WWE Championship between Wade Barrett and Randy Orton. Per stipulation, if Barrett didn't win the championship, Cena would be \"fired\" from the WWE.\n\nOrton defeated Barrett to retain the title, thus terminating Cena's WWE contract (kayfabe). The following night on \"Raw\", Cena gave a farewell speech, before costing Wade Barrett the WWE Championship by interfering in his rematch with Randy Orton. A week later, Cena invaded \"Raw\", first as a spectator, but then attacked members of Nexus, explaining that he would still take down Nexus one by one, despite not having a job in the WWE anymore. On the December 13 episode of \"Raw\", Cena was rehired by Barrett in exchange that he would face him on December 19 at in a chairs match, which Cena won.\nOn the December 27 episode of \"Raw\", The Nexus, minus Barrett, announced they were under new management and offered to bury the hatchet with Cena, to which he refused. The Nexus attacked Cena, leaving a Nexus armband in the ring during the process. As the group retreated, CM Punk, who had attacked Cena with a steel chair twice the week before, came to the ring to apparently attack Cena, but instead put on the armband left behind to symbolically announce his allegiance with The Nexus, becoming leader the following week by manipulating Barrett's banishment from the group. On the January 17, 2011 episode of \"Raw\", Cena returned and faced Punk in a match, which ended in a no contest after Cena was attacked by the debuting Mason Ryan, who later joined The Nexus. Cena competed in the 2011 Royal Rumble match at the pay-per-view, which saw Cena eliminate most of the Nexus members, ending his feud with the stable.\n\nDuring the same match at the Royal Rumble, Cena made it to the final five before being eliminated by then WWE Champion The Miz, who was not part of the match. Cena won the Elimination Chamber match at the titular pay-per-view to face Miz at WrestleMania XXVII for the WWE Championship.\n\nOn the February 21 episode of \"Raw\", Cena replied in rap form to comments made by The Rock the previous week, as The Rock returned as the announced guest host of WrestleMania. That night, Cena was placed into a WWE Tag Team Championship match, with him teaming with The Miz, where they defeated Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater to become WWE Tag Team Champions. However, their rematch clause was immediately invoked and they won the title back after The Miz attacked Cena. After weeks of insults, Cena and Rock finally met, where, after a verbal confrontation, and brief attack by The Miz and Alex Riley, Cena attacked The Rock with the \"Attitude Adjustment\". At WrestleMania XXVII, Cena and Miz fought to a double countout, but The Rock restarted the match and performed a \"Rock Bottom\" on Cena, allowing The Miz to retain the title. The next night on \"Raw\", Cena, in response to The Rock \"screwing\" him out of the title, agreed to face him in the main event of WrestleMania XXVIII, making it the first match to be set up for WrestleMania one year in advance. At Extreme Rules, Cena defeated The Miz and John Morrison to become WWE Champion. Cena went on to successfully defend the title against The Miz at Over the Limit in an \"I Quit\" match and R-Truth at Capitol Punishment. Cena then began a feud with CM Punk, who was leaving the company at Money in the Bank, where he defeated Cena to win the WWE Championship, and left the company with the title. After Rey Mysterio won the WWE Championship in a tournament, Cena challenged and defeated him later that night to become WWE Champion for a record-breaking ninth time, only to be interrupted by CM Punk, who also claimed to be champion. Punk again defeated Cena at SummerSlam in a championship unification match. After Alberto Del Rio became WWE Champion by cashing in his Money in the Bank briefcase, Cena became number one contender and beat Del Rio at Night of Champions to win the WWE Championship for the tenth time. He lost it back to Del Rio at Hell in a Cell, in a triple threat Hell in a Cell match also involving CM Punk. Cena lost his rematch to Alberto Del Rio at Vengeance in a Last Man Standing match, due to interference by The Miz and R-Truth. After a few weeks of Miz and Truth attacking Cena and other employees, Cena was allowed to choose his partner to challenge Miz and Truth at Survivor Series and Cena chose The Rock as his partner. Despite exchanging insults in the following weeks, they defeated Miz and Truth, though Rock closed the show by giving Cena a \"Rock Bottom\".\n\nCena then began a feud with Kane, who cited his disgust for Cena's \"Rise Above Hate\" slogan and claimed that Cena would need to embrace the hate in order to defeat The Rock at WrestleMania. Cena fought Kane to a draw at the Royal Rumble, and then defeated him in an Ambulance match at Elimination Chamber. At WrestleMania XXVIII, Cena faced The Rock in the main event match which had been building for a year and was billed as \"once in a lifetime\". The match ended when Cena attempted the \"People's Elbow\" on The Rock, and Rock countered with a \"Rock Bottom\" for the pinfall. The following night on \"Raw\", Cena accepted his loss and invited The Rock to the ring so that he could congratulate him. However, Cena's call was answered instead by the returning Brock Lesnar, who then attacked Cena with an \"F-5\". This resulted in Cena feuding with the \"Raw\" general manager John Laurinaitis, who revealed that he signed Lesnar to bring \"legitimacy\" to WWE and for Lesnar to become its \"new face\". At Extreme Rules, Cena defeated Lesnar in an Extreme Rules match. His feud with Laurinaitis escalated after Big Show cost Cena a match against him at Over the Limit, but Laurinaitis was fired at No Way Out after Cena defeated Big Show in a match with both of their jobs on the line. Cena won the Money in the Bank ladder match at the eponymous pay-per-view, earning a contract for a shot at the WWE Championship anytime within a year. At \"Raw 1000\", Cena cashed in his contract on CM Punk, and won the match by disqualification after Big Show interfered, becoming the first person to cash in a Money in the Bank contract and not win a title. Cena's feud with Punk continued into SummerSlam, where Punk defeated Cena and Big Show to retain the title, and at Night of Champions, where they fought to a draw. After being sidelined with a legitimate arm injury, Cena returned at Survivor Series to be pinned by Punk in a match which also featured Ryback. Cena then feuded with Dolph Ziggler over an alleged relationship with AJ Lee and at , lost to him in a ladder match for his Money in the Bank contract, after AJ turned on Cena. The following night on \"Raw\", Cena teamed with Vickie Guerrero to face Ziggler and AJ in a mixed tag team match which ended in a disqualification after Cena was attacked by the debuting Big E Langston. Cena then defeated Ziggler on the January 7, 2013 episode of \"Raw\" in a singles match, and again in a steel cage match the following week, despite interference from AJ and Langston in both matches to end the feud.\n\nOn January 27, 2013, Cena won his second Royal Rumble match, and later announced that he'd pursue the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 29. Cena, along with Ryback and Sheamus, began feuding with The Shield, which culminated in a six-man tag team match at Elimination Chamber, where The Shield were victorious. On the February 25 episode of \"Raw\", Cena defeated CM Punk to reaffirm his status as number one contender for the Rock's WWE Championship. He then returned to his rivalry with The Rock, with Cena blaming his personal and professional troubles on his loss to The Rock the previous year, going so far as admitting his own vanity had cost him the match. At WrestleMania 29, Cena defeated Rock in their rematch to win his eleventh WWE Championship and shook hands with Rock as sign of respect. Cena then began a rivalry with Ryback, during which Cena suffered a legitimate achilles tendon injury, while also battling The Shield and facing them in losing efforts. Cena retained his championship against Ryback in a Last Man Standing match at Extreme Rules as the match ended in a no contest aftet both men were down for a 10 count. Cena then defeated Ryback in a Three Stages of Hell match at Payback. He defeated Mark Henry via submission at Money in the Bank. At SummerSlam, Cena lost the WWE Championship to Daniel Bryan, with Triple H as the special guest referee ending his reign at 133 days. The following night on \"Raw\", Cena announced that he would undergo surgery for a triceps tear and would be out for four to six months.\n\nCena returned at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view and defeated Alberto Del Rio to win his third World Heavyweight Championship. Cena successfully defended his championship against Damien Sandow on the October 28 episode of \"Raw\", and Alberto Del Rio in a rematch at Survivor Series. Next, Cena challenged then WWE Champion Randy Orton to unify their respective championships, with The Authority agreeing and arranging for a Tables, Ladders and Chairs title unification match at the pay-per-view, which Cena lost. A rematch occurred at the Royal Rumble for the now unified WWE World Heavyweight Championship, where Cena lost after being distracted by The Wyatt Family. The Wyatts continued to interfere in Cena's matches,<ref name=\"http://www.wwe.com/videos/playlists/raw-january-27-2014-highlights\"></ref> and at Elimination Chamber, caused Cena's elimination in the Elimination Chamber match.\n\nAfter Elimination Chamber, Bray Wyatt accepted Cena's challenge for a WrestleMania match, Wyatt wanted to prove that Cena's heroic act was a facade characteristic of \"this era of lies\" while further wanting to turn Cena into a \"monster\". At WrestleMania XXX, Cena overcame interference from Luke Harper and Erick Rowan to defeat Wyatt. The feud continued after WrestleMania based on the story that Wyatt was capturing Cena's fanbase, which was exemplified by Wyatt leading a children's choir to the ring on the April 28 episode of \"Raw\", with the children later putting on sheep masks. At Extreme Rules, Wyatt defeated Cena in a steel cage match, after repeated interference from the rest of the Wyatt Family members and a demonic child. Cena's feud with Wyatt continued with a Last Man Standing match being set up for Payback, where Cena buried Wyatt under multiple equipment cases to win the match.\n\nOn the June 16 episode of \"Raw\", Cena defeated Kane in a stretcher match to qualify for the ladder match for the vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank, where Cena won his 15th world championship. Cena then retained the title at Battleground in a fatal four-way match against Roman Reigns, Randy Orton and Kane. At SummerSlam, Cena lost the championship to Brock Lesnar in a squash match, during which Lesnar hit Cena with sixteen suplexes and two \"F-5s\", ending his reign at 49 days. Cena invoked his title rematch clause against Lesnar for Night of Champions, nearly winning before Seth Rollins attacked him to cause a disqualification, although he became the first wrestler to defeat Lesnar in two WWE pay-per-view events. Cena then began feuding with Dean Ambrose for the right to face Rollins at Hell in a Cell, but Ambrose won the right by defeating Cena in a No Holds Barred Contract on a Pole match. Cena would instead face Randy Orton in a Hell in a Cell match to determine the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which Cena won.\n\nOn October 27 episode of \"Raw\", Cena rejected The Authority's offer to join forces, which resulted in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination tag match between Team Cena and Team Authority at Survivor Series. Cena's team consisted of Dolph Ziggler, Big Show, Erick Rowan and Ryback; at Survivor Series, Show turned on Cena, causing Cena's elimination, but Ziggler eventually won the match for Team Cena with the interfering Sting's help. Thus as per the match stipulation, The Authority were stripped from power and only Cena could bring them back. At , Cena defeated Rollins in a tables match to retain his WWE World Heavyweight Championship No. 1 contender status. It was then announced that Cena would face Lesnar for the title at the Royal Rumble. On the December 29 episode of \"Raw\", Rollins and Big Show held guest host Edge hostage, forcing Cena to reinstate The Authority. On the January 5 episode of \"Raw\", The Authority added Rollins to the title match at the Royal Rumble involving Cena and Lesnar, and Ziggler, Ryback and Rowan were \"fired\" for joining Team Cena at Survivor Series. On the January 19 episode of \"Raw\", Cena won a handicap match against Rollins, Big Show and Kane to retain his title shot at the Royal Rumble and win back the jobs of Ziggler, Ryback and Rowan. At the Royal Rumble, Cena was unsuccessful in capturing the title.\n\nFollowing the Royal Rumble, Cena began feuding with then United States Champion Rusev and at Fastlane, Rusev defeated Cena to retain his title after Cena passed out to his submission, the \"Accolade\", after Rusev hit Cena with a low blow following a distraction from his manager Lana. In the following weeks, Cena challenged Rusev to a rematch, which was declined, and Stephanie McMahon decreed that Cena would not compete at WrestleMania 31 unless Rusev agreed to a rematch. On the March 9 episode of \"Raw\", Cena attacked Rusev, refusing to release the \"STF\" submission hold, causing Lana to grant Cena the match. Cena defeated Rusev at WrestleMania to win the United States Championship for the fourth time, marking Rusev's first pinfall loss in the main roster. The following night on \"Raw\", Cena announced that he would issue an open challenge each week on \"Raw\" with his United States Championship on the line—he successfully defended his title against the likes of Dean Ambrose, Stardust, Bad News Barrett, Kane, Sami Zayn, Neville, Zack Ryder and Cesaro. Cena retained his title against Rusev in a Russian Chain match at Extreme Rules and a \"I Quit\" match at Payback. The following night on \"Raw\", Cena was attacked by then NXT Champion Kevin Owens, setting up a Champion vs. Champion match at Elimination Chamber, where Owens defeated Cena, but Cena defeated Owens in a rematch at Money in the Bank. Cena defeated Owens at Battleground to retain the United States Championship and end the feud. Cena then resumed his feud with then WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins, with Rollins refusing Cena's challenges for the title. On the July 27 episode of Raw, The Authority forced Cena to defend the United States Championship against Rollins. Cena defeated Rollins despite suffering a legitimate broken nose during the match. Cena then faced Rollins in a \"Winner Takes All\" match at SummerSlam, for both the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and the United States Championship, which Cena lost after guest host Jon Stewart, appearing to side with Cena, instead attacked him with a steel chair, ending Cena's reign at 147 days.\n\nCena defeated Rollins to win the title for the fifth time at Night of Champions, a record in the WWE ownership era of the title. Cena then retained his title against Rollins the following night on \"Raw\" and then in a steel cage match at WWE Live from Madison Square Garden, while also restarting his open challenges and successfully defend the title against New Day members Xavier Woods and Big E and Dolph Ziggler. At Hell in a Cell, Cena lost the title to the returning Alberto Del Rio in an open challenge. After a hiatus, Cena returned on the December 28 episode of \"Raw\", defeating Del Rio by disqualification in a rematch for the title. On the January 7, 2016 episode of \"SmackDown\" taped on January 5, Cena aided Kalisto at ringside to victory against Del Rio. That same day, he underwent surgery on a shoulder injury, which would keep him out of action for an undisclosed amount of time.\n\nCena returned at WrestleMania 32, helping The Rock fend off The Wyatt Family. Cena then made his full return on the Memorial Day edition of \"Raw\" on May 30, four months earlier than had been expected for his type of injury. He was confronted by AJ Styles, only to be betrayed by Styles, who joined his former Club teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson in attacking Cena. This set up a match between Cena and Styles at Money in the Bank, which Styles won with interference from Gallows and Anderson. On the July 4 episode of \"Raw\", Cena was again attacked by the Club, but was saved by Enzo Amore and Big Cass. Subsequently, a six-man tag team match was made between the two teams for Battleground. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Cena was drafted to the SmackDown brand, while also defeating Club member Luke Gallows via pinfall in a singles contest. Cena, Amore and Cass defeated The Club at Battleground after Cena pinned Styles. Cena continued his feud with Styles, which resulted in him losing their match at SummerSlam on August 21. With Styles later winning the renamed WWE World Championship, Cena challenged him and previous champion Dean Ambrose in a triple threat match for the title at No Mercy. He lost the match after being pinned by Styles, which came after Ambrose and Cena simultaneously made Styles submit, therefore restarting the match. Cena then took a hiatus from WWE to film \"American Grit\" season 2.\n\nOn the December 13 episode of \"SmackDown Live\" it was announced that Cena would be returning on the December 27 episode. On his return, he addressed rumors about him during the past year, stated that the New Era was \"B.S.\", and then challenged the winner of that night's championship match, which was AJ Styles, for the again renamed WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble. On January 29, 2017, Cena defeated Styles at the Royal Rumble to tie Ric Flair for the most world title reigns at 16, although Flair has actually won the world title several more times with the number 16 having been called \"WWE mythology\". Cena then entered the Elimination Chamber match as WWE Champion. He was eliminated fourth after a \"Sister Abigail\" from Bray Wyatt, who went on to win the championship. Two nights later on \"SmackDown Live\", Cena lost a triple threat match against Wyatt for the championship in a match also featuring Styles. Cena then began a feud with The Miz; after Cena eliminated Miz from both the Elimination Chamber and a 10-man battle royal to face Wyatt at WrestleMania 33, Miz came back in and eliminated Cena. The next week, Miz accused Cena of being a hypocrite due to his movie commitments, while Cena accused Miz of stealing other wrestlers' moves and personalities. Miz's wife Maryse then slapped Cena before Cena and his girlfriend Nikki Bella sent Miz and Maryse retreating. SmackDown GM Daniel Bryan then set up a mixed tag team match between the two pairs for WrestleMania 33, which Cena and Bella won. Cena proposed marriage to Bella after the match and she accepted. Cena then went on a hiatus from WWE to film season 2 of \"American Grit\".\n\nIn July 2017, WWE dubbed Cena a \"free agent\" during the Superstar Shake-up, meaning he would work for both the Raw and SmackDown brands. Following his return he quickly re-entered a feud with former rival Rusev, who Cena would challenge to a flag match with Rusev later accepting the challenge at Battleground, which Cena won. On the August 1 episode of SmackDown Live, Cena faced Shinsuke Nakamura in the main event with the winner going on to face Jinder Mahal in the main event of SummerSlam with Mahal's WWE Championship on the line. Shinsuke would claim the upset victory over Cena with Cena giving Nakamura his seal of approval after the contest.\n\nFollowing this, Cena entered a feud with Baron Corbin. After defeating Jinder Mahal via disqualification on the August 15 episode of SmackDown, Corbin would attempt to cash-in his Money in the Bank briefcase but after interference from Cena, he was unsuccessful. This led to a match between Cena and Corbin at SummerSlam which saw Cena walk away with the pinfall victory, thus ending the fued. After SummerSlam, Cena entered into a feud against Roman Reigns, with a match being set for No Mercy. In the weeks leading up to the match, the two cut various worked shoot promos on each other, going back and forth about what they perceive the other to be and why the crowds react the way they do. Over the course of the rivalry, the duo were also forced to team together in consecutive tag team matches defeating the likes of Samoa Joe and The Miz (on the August 21 episode of RAW) and The Club (on the August 28 episode of RAW). At No Mercy, Reigns defeated Cena after kicking out of a 'Super AA' and delivering a single spear. Despite sparking rumors of his retirement after the match by endorsing Reigns, taking a bow, thanking the crowd, and waving goodbye to them before leaving, Cena returned to SmackDown the next month after Commissioner Shane McMahon named him the final member of Team SmackDown for the men's 5-on-5 elimination match against Team Raw at Survivor Series; at the event, Cena was eliminated by Kurt Angle and Team SmackDown was later defeated.\n\nFrom January until April 2018, Cena was involved in a storyline where he was trying to find his \"path to WrestleMania\". After he lost the Royal Rumble and the namesake Elimination Chamber match to determine the next number one contender for the Universal Championship at Elimination Chamber, as well as a six-pack challenge at Fastlane for the WWE Championship, Cena issued a challenge to The Undertaker for a match at WrestleMania 34. He repeated his challenge over the next several weeks, only to receive no answer from Undertaker. On the March 19 episode of RAW, after calling out The Undertaker yet again, Cena was confronted and choke slammed by Undertaker's storyline brother Kane. This led to a no-disqualification match between the two a week later which Cena won. After the match, Cena called out The Undertaker again to no response. At WrestleMania 34, after Cena drove off Elias in a confrontation, Undertaker returned and accepted Cena's challenge, leading to a shocked Cena losing to Undertaker in just a few minutes. Three weeks later, at the Greatest Royal Rumble, Cena defeated Triple H. After the match he thanked the crowd for sticking by him during a tough period, referencing his loss to Undertaker at WrestleMania and his recent breakup with Nikki Bella. He then went on hiatus to focus on his acting and television career.\n\nOn August 10, it was announced Cena would face Kevin Owens at WWE Super Show-Down in Melbourne, Australia. On August 20, the match was later changed to a tag team contest with Cena teaming with former rival Bobby Lashley to take on the team of Owens and Elias. On September 2, Cena debuted a new finishing move whilst teaming with Lashley and Finn Balor against Elias, Jinder Mahal and Baron Corbin at a live event in Shanghai. Having hyped the match on Twitter over the weeks leading to the event, Cena would declare he was set to unveil his 'sixth move of doom' - a reference to the criticism he has received for the perceived limitations in his move set - the move would end up being a variation of a lightning fist, which he used to pin Elias. At Super Show-Down, Cena and Lashley defeated Owens and Elias, with Cena once again using Lighting Fist as his finishing move. On the October 8 episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that Cena would represent Raw in the interbrand eight-man WWE World Cup Tournament at WWE Crown Jewel. On SmackDown 1000, Cena appeared via satellite where he reminisced on his debut, stating he regretted slapping Kurt Angle but never regretted starting out his career on SmackDown. A week later on \"RAW\", Angle evaluated his World Cup competition, including Cena. On the October 29 episode of \"Raw\", after Bobby Lashley would get himself disqualified in a singles contest against Finn Balor, acting General Manager, Baron Corbin, rewarded Lashley's display of dominance with a spot in the eight-man WWE World Cup Tournament at the expense of Cena who was the only superstar in the tournament who hadn't actually qualified. This was done as Cena had legitimately refused to work the event following the murder of Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nCena's original gimmick portrayed that of a white rapper who wore jerseys, backwards hats, and a chain with a padlock around his neck, was known as the \"Doctor of Thuganomics\". First as \"The Prototype\", and later under his real name, Cena sometimes used underhanded tactics to score victories, such as using his chain as a weapon behind the referee's back. Cena often rapped before his matches, insulting his opponents, events that happened in the media, and even the crowd. Cena also regularly performed \"rap battles\", where he and his opponent took turns rapping on each other. Cena reverted to this persona once during his feud with The Rock. In 2005, shortly after his first debut film, \"The Marine\", his wrestling character was shifted from a rapper to that of a young military upstart. After WWE's change from TV-14 to TV-PG in mid 2008, the name of his finishing move, the \"F-U\", was changed to the \"Attitude Adjustment\" in order to fit with WWE's new policies. During his career, he is known for ending his matches with a sequence of moves, dubbed \"The Five Moves of Doom\". The moves typically go in the order as follows: flying shoulder block, sit-out hip toss, side-release spinout powerbomb, \"Five Knuckle Shuffle\" and \"Attitude Adjustment\". During the summer of 2018, Cena hyped a sixth move. On September 1, Cena executed the move, known as the \"Lightning Fist\", a high-impact left handed jab to the opponent.\n\nCena has portrayed a heroic character throughout his WWE career, with the exception of a villainous run in 2002–2003. Cena's signature ring gear includes jean shorts, sneakers, wristbands, and armbands. Cena also wears a variety of T-shirts and baseball caps, which commonly include one of his catchphrases such as \"never give up\", \"you can't see me\", \"hustle, loyalty, respect\" and \"respect. Earn it\".\n\nCena has a history of returning from actual (and kayfabe) injuries much sooner than expected. In 2016, ESPN reporter David Shoemaker said, \"Never underestimate Cena's recuperative abilities. He's somewhere on the recovery scale between German platelet-rich plasma therapy and Deadpool.\" Big Show stated he felt the most stable to be lifted by Cena, despite Cena being over 200 lbs lighter and almost a foot shorter, a testament to Cena's functional strength.\n\nDuring his WWE career, Cena's attire has attempted to reflect the most current fashions and stylings within the hip hop culture that his character represents. Cena started out wearing \"throwback jerseys\" until WWE produced specific Cena merchandise which he began wearing. While Cena was a member of the \"SmackDown\" brand, one of his WWE produced T-shirts bore the suggestive spoonerism \"Ruck Fules\". Whenever it appeared on television the image was censored, not by the network, but by WWE to sell more shirts under the premise that it was \"too hot for TV\". He also wore a chain with a large padlock, occasionally using it as a weapon, until WrestleMania 21, when it was replaced with a chromed and diamond studded \"Chain Gang\" spinner medallion – reminiscent of the ones worn by members of G-Unit – matching his spinner title belt.\n\nAround the time \"The Marine\" was released, Cena began wearing attire more military related, including camouflage shorts, dog tags, a Marine soldier cap, and a WWE produced shirt with the legend \"Chain Gang Assault Battalion\". Shortly after WrestleMania 23, when promotion for \"The Marine\" ended, the military attire diminished and was replaced with apparel bearing his new slogan \"American Made Muscle\" along with denim shorts, not seen since he was a member of the \"SmackDown\" roster. He then wore shirts that promoted Cenation and his trademark line \"You Can't See Me\".\n\nCena has been named as the greatest professional wrestler of all time by peers Kurt Angle and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, as well as by veteran industry personality Paul Heyman.\n\nWWE Studios, a division of WWE which produces and finances motion pictures, produced Cena's first movie – \"The Marine\", which was distributed theatrically by 20th Century Fox America beginning on October 13, 2006. In its first week, the film made approximately US$7 million at the United States box office. After ten weeks in theaters, the film grossed $18.7 million. Once the film was released on DVD, it fared better, making $30 million in rentals in the first twelve weeks.\nHis second film, also produced by WWE Studios, was \"12 Rounds\". Filming began on February 25, 2008, in New Orleans; the film was released on March 27, 2009.\n\nCena co-starred in his third film produced by WWE Studios, titled \"Legendary\", which was played in selected theaters starting on September 10, 2010, for a limited time, then it was released on DVD on September 28, 2010.\n\nThat same year, Cena starred in the children's film \"\", a film based on Lucas Cruikshank's YouTube videos of the same name, where he plays Fred's imaginary father. The movie was first aired on Nickelodeon in September 2010.\n\nIn 2015, Cena made appearances in the comedy films \"Trainwreck\", \"Sisters\" and a cameo in \"Daddy's Home\".\n\nHe was the pace car driver for the 58th annual Daytona 500.\n\nIn 2017, Cena lent his voice for the animated film, \"Ferdinand.\" He also appeared \"Daddy's Home 2\", reprising his role from the 2015 film.\n\nIn 2018, Cena starred in the comedy \"Blockers\", and will have a leading role in the \"Transformers\" spin-off prequel, \"Bumblebee\".\n\nBefore his WWE debut, Cena made an appearance on the webcast \"Go Sick\" as Bruebaker, an angry, cursing wrestler in 2001.\nDuring his WWE career, Cena has appeared on ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" three times. Cena has also appeared on morning radio shows; including the CBS and XM versions of Opie and Anthony as part of their \"walkover\" on October 10, 2006. Other appearances have included NBC's \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", Fuse's \"Celebrity Playlist\", Fox Sports Net's \"The Best Damn Sports Show Period\", FOX's \"MADtv\", \"G4's Training Camp\" (with Shelton Benjamin), and two appearances on MTV's \"Punk'd\" (August 2006 and May 2007), as the victim of a practical joke. He also served as a co-presenter, with Hulk Hogan, at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards, as a guest judge during the third week of the 2006 season of \"Nashville Star\", and appeared at the 2007 Nickelodeon UK Kids Choice Awards.\n\nIn January 2007, Cena, Batista, and Ashley Massaro appeared representing WWE on an episode of \"\", giving the children of the family whose house was being renovated WWE merchandise and eight tickets to WrestleMania 23. Two months later, he and Bobby Lashley appeared on the NBC game show \"Deal or No Deal\" as \"moral support\" to longtime WWE fan and front row staple, Rick \"Sign Guy\" Achberger. Edge and Randy Orton also appeared, but as antagonists. On April 9, 2008, Cena, along with fellow wrestlers Triple H and Chris Jericho, appeared on the \"Idol Gives Back\" fund-raising special. In March 2009, Cena made an appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" during the show's cold opening sequence. On March 7, 2009, he was a guest on NPR's quiz show \"Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!\" in a Not My Job sequence titled \"Sure, pro wrestling is a good gig, but when you win, do they throw teddy bears into the ring?\".\n\nIn 2001, between his training in Ultimate Pro Wrestling and Ohio Valley Wrestling, Cena was involved in the UPN produced reality show \"Manhunt\", in which he portrayed Big Tim Kingman, leader of the group of bounty hunters who chased down the contestants who acted as fugitives. The show, however, was mired in controversy when it was alleged that the portions of the show were rigged to eliminate certain players, scenes were re-shot or staged to enhance drama and contestants read from scripts.\n\nCena was featured on the ABC reality series \"\", which aired in June 2007, making it to the final round before being eliminated on June 24, placing third in the competition overall.\n\nIn 2007, Cena was interviewed for the \"CNN Special Investigations Unit\" documentary, \"Death Grip: Inside Pro Wrestling\", which focused on steroid and drug use in professional wrestling. When asked if he had taken steroids he was heard to reply, \"I can't tell you that I haven't, but you will never prove that I have\". The day after the documentary aired, WWE accused CNN of taking Cena's comments out of context to present a biased point of view, backing up their claim by posting an unedited video of Cena answering the same question – filmed by WWE cameras from another angle – in which he is heard beginning the same statement with \"absolutely not\". A text interview on the website with Cena later had him saying the news outlet should apologize for misrepresenting him, which CNN refused, saying they felt the true answer to the question began with the phrase \"my answer to that question\". However, they did edit the documentary on subsequent airings to include the \"absolutely not\".\n\nCena hosted the Australian Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards with Natalie Bassingthwaighte on October 11, 2008, in Melbourne.\n\nCena guest starred as Ewan O'Hara, brother of Juliet O'Hara, in an episode of the fourth season of the comedy drama \"Psych\".

A $1 million USD prize was given to the winning team. \"American Grit\" premiered on Fox on April 14, 2016.

The finale of Season 1 aired on June 9, 2016.\n\nCena hosted the ESPN ESPY Awards on July 13, 2016, in Los Angeles.\n\nOn December 10, 2016, Cena was the guest host of \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\") on NBC.\n\nOn January 24, 2017, Nickelodeon announced that Cena would host the 2017 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards ceremony on March 11.

He performed his fifth WWE theme song, \"Basic Thuganomics\", and it was featured on the WWE soundtrack album \"WWE Originals\". He also recorded a song, \"Untouchables\", for the company's next soundtrack album \"\".

In 2009, Cena received the Chris Greicius Celebrity Award.\n\nFrom late 2011 until WrestleMania XXVIII, Cena wore a black \"Rise Above Hate\" T-shirt promoting WWE's \"Be a Star\" anti-bullying campaign. In September and October 2012, Cena wore pink and black with the phrase \"Rise Above Cancer\" in partnership with Susan G. Komen for the Cure as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n\nIn November 2016 Cena appeared in a public service announcement, \"We Are America\", sponsored by the Ad Council as part of its \"Love Has No Labels\" campaign.\n\nIn mid-2015, Cena was the subject of the Internet meme \"Unexpected John Cena\", also known as simply \"Unexpected Cena\" or \"It's John Cena\".\n\nCena resides in Tampa, Florida.\n\nWhile promoting his 2009 film \"12 Rounds\", Cena announced his engagement to Elizabeth Huberdeau. They were married on July 11, 2009. On May 1, 2012, Cena filed for divorce, which was finalized on July 18. The divorce was mentioned on-screen during Cena's feud with The Rock as part of their rematch at WrestleMania 29. In 2012, he began dating fellow wrestler Nikki Bella.

{"id": "4459599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4459599", "title": "Keepmoat Stadium", "text": "Keepmoat Stadium\n\nKeepmoat Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Doncaster, England, with a capacity of 15,231. It cost approximately £20 million to construct, as part of the wider complex it resides within which in total cost approximately £32 million, and is used by Doncaster Rovers, Doncaster Rugby League Club and Doncaster Rovers Belles Ladies Football Club.\n\nThe first match at the stadium was a Rugby League match on 27 December 2006, when Sheffield Eagles beat Doncaster 16–10.\n\nThe official opening of the Keepmoat Stadium was on 3 August 2007, with Doncaster Rovers playing a Manchester United XI in front of a crowd of 13,080. United won the game 2–0.\n\nOn 19 June 2012, it was confirmed that Doncaster Rovers had secured a 99-year operating lease from Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council to lead the management of the stadium with a view to improving operating results across the stadium sports partnership.\n\nAt the Stadium Business Awards 2010, the stadium received the award for Best Matchday Experience.\n\nThe stadium itself is sponsored under a long-term contract by Keepmoat, a company specialising in council housing. They have the rights to the naming of the stadium.\n\nThe East Stand is sponsored by Bartercard UK. The area of the East Stand towards the South East corner is the Families area sponsored by Doncaster Culture and Leisure Trust and is known as the \"DCLT\" Families Stand.\n\nThis is the main match-day reception area with the stand sponsored by Estate.com.\n\nThe South Stand, popularly known as the Black Bank, is sponsored by Polypipe. For Doncaster Rovers matches this is the stand that houses the Black Bank (the Ultras group of Doncaster Rovers supporters) and is decorated with flags and banners on match days, widely known for creating a fantastic atmosphere.\n\nThe North Stand is sponsored by Corsan. The North Stand area closest to the East Stand is the usual location of visiting fans. Depending on the numbers of visitors, the availability of seats in this area are expanded westwards to meet demand.\n\nThe all-seater stadium holds 15,231 spectators, 5,000 more than Belle Vue, with improved legroom and disabled access. Amongst the facilities in the new stadium is a new fans' bar, created to ensure fans have a place where they can enjoy pre-match drinks.\n\nThe pitch itself incorporates a system of synthetic fibres interwoven with natural grass. This helps to maintain the pitch's integrity and prevents the playing surface from deteriorating throughout the course of the season. The pitch however does not have an under-soil heating system in-place, despite being a modern construction. This has resulted in the postponement of a match within the first year of full operation.\n\nA mini-stadium is situated beside the main stadium, featuring a six-lane running track and a 500-seat stand. The mini stadium is used by Doncaster Rovers Belles, Doncaster Rovers Reserves, Doncaster Athletics Club, Doncaster RLFC's academy team, and the Doncaster Mustangs American football team.\n\nThe first game played by Doncaster Rovers in the new stadium was on 1 January 2007 against Huddersfield Town, whom they beat 3–0. The game also saw the first three red cards in the new stadium. Doncaster Rovers' centre forward Mark McCammon was the first player ever to score on the new pitch.\n\nDoncaster's first loss at the stadium came five days later at the hands of Bolton Wanderers when they defeated the Rovers 4–0 in the 3rd Round of the FA Cup.\n\nOn 14 January 2007, Doncaster Rovers Belles' first match in the main stadium resulted in a 5–2 defeat to Leeds United, before a crowd of 1,797. Vicky Exley was the first Belle to score on the new pitch. The stadium hosted the final of the 2012–13 FA Women's Cup.\n\nThe highest ever attendance at the Keepmoat stadium was 15,001 for the visit of Leeds United. Rovers also achieved attendances of over 14,800 at the Keepmoat Stadium in games against Sheffield Wednesday and Newcastle United.\n\nOn 3 March 2010, it hosted England’s under-21s 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 9 match against Greece’s under-21s. The hosts lost 2–1 with the visitors goals coming from Kyriakos Papadopoulos on the 28th minute and Yiannis Papadopoulos on the 49th minute while Nathan Delfouneso scored for the hosts on the 80th minute.\n\nThe opening game played by Doncaster in the new stadium was against Sheffield Eagles, to whom they lost 16–10 in front of 5,400 spectators. Sheffield Eagles (and former Dons') Richard Newlove was the first player to score try at the new stadium.\n\nOn Sunday 27 July 2008, the stadium hosted a semi-final of the Rugby League Challenge Cup between Hull F.C. and Wakefield Trinity. Hull beat Trinity 32–24 in front of a crowd of 14,716.\n\nThe stadium hosted the opening match of the 2009 Gillette 4 Nations on Friday 23 October between co-hosts England and France attracting a crowd of 11,529.\n\nThe stadium hosted the semi-final of the Rugby League Challenge Cup between Castleford and Leeds on Sunday 7 August 2011, Leeds winning 10-8 in front of 13,158 fans; another Challenge Cup Semi-Final between Hull FC and Wigan took place at the stadium on 29 July 2016, Hull running out 16-12 winners.\n\nThe Dons local rivals, Sheffield Eagles, used the stadium as their temporary home during the 2015 rugby league season.\n\nThere have also been a variety of other events held in the Keepmoat Stadium, including two concerts in July 2007 featuring Ronan Keating, Bryan Adams and McFly. In July 2008 there was also a show by Sir Elton John and his band.\n\nIn September 2008, the stadium was used to host the BAFL (British American Football League) finals known as \"Britbowl\".\n\nIn mid June 2009 opened its facilities to accommodate corporate events and private functions, the first of which being the marriage reception of Wesley and Claire Vaughan, June 2009.\n\nIn November 2010, darts superstar Dennis Priestley held a darts exhibition at the Keepmoat Stadium.\n\nOn 30 July 2011, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for Gravity Tour supporting their album Gravity.\n\nOn 11 May 2013, an IBF Bantamweight World Title boxing match between Jamie McDonnell and Julio Ceja took place at the Keepmoat Stadium, with McDonnell the winner.\n\nOn 27 July 2013, an MMA even hosted by UCFC has held at the Keepmoat Stadium, the main event was between Ian Freeman and Ricco Rodriguez\n\nOn 28 April 2016 it was announced that Rugby Union team Doncaster Knights would use the Keepmoat for a maximum of six games next season if they are to win promotion to the Aviva Premiership. This would allow work to be undertaken on their home ground of Castle Park in order to bring it up to at least the minimum seating capacity of 10,000 required by the RFU and the Professional Game Board (PGB) for a premiership venue.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "679469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=679469", "title": "Philadelphia Sphas", "text": "Philadelphia Sphas\n\nThe Philadelphia Sphas, also stylized SPHAs or SPHAS, were an American basketball franchise that existed in professional, semi-professional, and exhibition forms. They played their home games in the ballroom of Philadelphia's Broadwood Hotel. The team's name is an acronym, derived from South Philadelphia Hebrew Association (the group that initially funded the team), and the team's players, at least in its earlier years, were primarily Jewish. Future Philadelphia Warriors owner Eddie Gottlieb founded the team as an amateur group shortly after he and some close friends graduated from high school, and the team evolved into a professional unit that played in many leagues around the Philadelphia area and the East Coast, most notably the Eastern Basketball League and the American Basketball League, between which the Sphas won 10 championships. The Sphas won a total of 12 championships, their first two coming from the early Philadelphia League and Philadelphia Basket Ball League.\n\nWith the 1946 advent of the Basketball Association of America, the immediate predecessor of the NBA, the ABL became a minor-league, and the Sphas would remain there as a semi-professional team until 1949. Gottlieb sold the team in 1950 to Red Klotz, a former Spha. 1949 would be the last year the Sphas were affiliated with a league, but thanks to Gottlieb's friendship with Abe Saperstein, president and owner of the Harlem Globetrotters, the Sphas lived on as one of the exhibition teams that the Globetrotters would play, although they would retain only the franchise name, not the Jewish makeup of the team.\n\nDespite popular wisdom, the Sphas did not directly evolve into the Washington Generals. Instead, Saperstein had asked Klotz to create a separate exhibition team because the Sphas had beaten the Globetrotters on more than one occasion. After creating the Generals, Klotz sold the Sphas to one of his players, Pete Monska, who coached the team \"for a year or two until it disbanded [in October 1959.]\" The Sphas played their last game as the original team on October 17, 1959, losing to the Globetrotters in a double-header exhibition game. The Sphas were then reconstituted as the Baltimore Rockets, another Globetrotters exhibition team.\n\nThe Sphas' existence began in 1917 as an amateur team by neighborhood friends Eddie Gottlieb, Harry Passon, and Hughie Black, who wanted to keep their high school championship team together. The team's first season took place in the American League of Philadelphia, a minor league that comprised six area teams. They were sponsored by the Young Men's Hebrew Association of South Philadelphia, and were called Philadelphia YMHA for that season. The team turned in a 4–11 record, tied for last in the league that year. After that season, the YMHA withdrew its support for the team, citing dissatisfaction with the game's violent nature.\n\nAfter losing their sponsorship from the YMHA, Gottlieb, Passon, and Black approached the South Philadelphia Hebrew Association about sponsoring the team. The association agreed to sponsor the men, and provided funding for uniforms to the team. The new uniforms featured the acronym SPHA in Hebrew (ספהא) across the front. Again, their sponsorial relationship was short-lived, as the SPHA withdrew their sponsorship shortly after for an unspecified reason. The men had better financial solvency this time around, as they opened a sporting goods store, calling it P.G.B. Sporting Goods. With the store, they created new uniforms, but kept the Sphas moniker as a way of paying tribute to their upbringing. Douglas Stark, author of \"The SPHAS: The Life and Times of Basketball's Greatest Jewish Team\", noted that \"[f]or a number of years, the team was known as the Wandering Jews, because the team did not have its own home court.\" The team continued to play in the American League of Philadelphia after losing their partnership with the SPHA, and played in two different leagues during the 1922–23 season: The Manufacturer's League, containing teams from area companies, and the Philadelphia League, which consisted of teams from the greater Philadelphia area, a number of them religious. In their single season in the Manufacturer's League, the team (known as Philadelphia Passon, Gottlieb, Black since they competed through Passon and Black's sporting goods store) turned in an overall 8–6 record, finishing 3rd in the first half of that season and 6th (out of 8) in the second half. Their first season in the Philadelphia League was a disappointing one, turning in an 8–11 record and finishing 2nd in the first half of the season, but last in the second half at 1–8. The Sphas' next season in the Philadelphia League would prove more fruitful (due in part to the increased number of games), as the Sphas turned in a 25–15 record, overcoming a first half slump of 14–13 (5th out of 8) to finish first in the second half of the season with an 11–3 record. They went on that year to defeat the Tri-Council Caseys 2–0 for their first championship.\n\nFor the 1924–25 season, the Philadelphia League reconstituted itself as the Philadelphia Basket Ball League, dropping the number of teams in the league to six. The Sphas continued a strong spate of play, finishing 1st in the first half of the season, and third in the second half. They would go on to be repeat champions that season, winning 2–1 again over Tri-Council. Due to the success of the Sphas against teams in the Philadelphia area, and frustration with playing in the \"poorly managed\" Eastern League in 1924–25, owner Eddie Gottlieb set up games against professional teams from the newly-formed American Basketball League. The Sphas played a six-game stretch against the Brooklyn Arcadians, Fort Wayne Caseys, Cleveland Rosenblums, Washington Palace Five, and a team from New York's Metropolitan League, the Paterson Legionaires. The Sphas won five out of six games in this series, and Gottlieb subsequently scheduled games against two top barnstorming teams of the day, the Original Celtics and New York Renaissance. The Sphas defeated the Original Celtics 2–1 and swept the Rens, 2–0. The team's victories over these top barnstorming teams gave them increased notability in the burgeoning professional basketball community. Riding the wave of victories his team achieved against the ABL and barnstorming teams, Gottlieb entered the Sphas in the ABL, rechristening them the Philadelphia Warriors. During their two years in the ABL as the Warriors, the team performed moderately well, finishing third (14–7) and then fourth (10–11) in the 1926–27 season. For the 1927–28 season, the ABL split into two divisions (Eastern and Western). The Warriors played in the Eastern Division and finished third with a 30–21 record. This allowed them entry into the playoffs, where they lost to the New York Celtics 2–0.\n"}

The most common distances are , , , and , although many races have other distances. The 100 kilometers is recognized as an official world record event by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the world governing body of track and field.\n\nOther distances/times include double marathons, 24-hour races, and multiday races of or even longer. The format of these events and the courses vary, ranging from single loops (some as short as a track), to point-to-point road or trail races, to cross-country rogaines. Many ultramarathons, especially trail challenges, have severe course obstacles, such as inclement weather, elevation change, or rugged terrain. Many of these races are run on dirt roads or mountain paths, though some are run on paved roads as well. Usually, there are aid stations every apart, where runners can replenish food and drink supplies or take a short break.\nTimed events range from 6, 12, and 24 hours to 3, 6, and 10 days (known as \"multi-day\" or \"stage race\" events). Timed events are generally run on a track or a short road course, often one mile (1.6 km) or less.\n\nConsidered to be a tougher event are self-supported ultramarathon stage races where each competitor has to carry all their supplies including food to survive the length of the race, typically a week. A good example of this is the Grand to Grand Ultra, America's first ever self-supported ultramarathon stage race.\nThe International Association of Ultrarunners (IAU) organises the World Championships for various ultramarathon distances, including , , 24 hours, and ultra trail running, which are also recognized by the IAAF. Many countries around the world have their own ultrarunning organizations, often the national athletics federation of that country, or are sanctioned by such national athletics organizations. World records for distances, times, and ages are tracked by the IAU.\n\nRacewalking events are usually 50 km, although 100 km and 100 mile (160 km) \"Centurion\" races are also organized. Furthermore, the non-competitive International Marching League event Nijmegen Four Days March has a regulation distance of 4 × 50 km over three days for men aged 19–49.\n\nThere are four IAU World Championships: the IAU 100 km World Championships, IAU 50 km World Championships, IAU 24 Hour World Championship, and the IAU Trail World Championship.\n\nFor reliable and updated information, see the IAU (International Association of Ultrarunners) annual report of current world records on its newest \"World's Best Performances\" page in statistics.\n\n\nUltra Marathons are run around the world with more than 70,000 people completing them every year.\n\nSeveral ultra distance events are held in Africa.\n\n\nUltrarunning has become popular in Asia recently, and countries such as Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea have hosted IAU World Championships.\n\n\nAustralia and New Zealand are hosts to some 100 organized ultramarathons each year. Additionally a handful of runners have run the entire length of New Zealand, a distance of around . The most recent runners being Lisa Tamati and Andrew Hedgman who both completed the challenge separately in 2009 and 2010.\n\nAustralia\n\nIn Australia, the Westfield Ultra Marathon was an annual race between Sydney and Melbourne contested between 1983 and 1991.
