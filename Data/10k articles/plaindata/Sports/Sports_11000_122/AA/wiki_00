While there have been many selectors of NFL MVPs in the past, today the MVP award presented by the AP is considered the \"de facto\" official NFL MVP award and the most prestigious. Since 2011, the NFL has held the annual NFL Honors ceremony to recognize the winner of each year's AP MVP award, along with other AP awards, such as the AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year and AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year. The current AP NFL MVP is quarterback Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, who won the award for the third time after the 2017 NFL season.\n\nThe AP has presented an award recognizing the NFL's top player since 1957. The award is voted upon by a panel of 50 sportswriters at the end of the regular season, before the playoffs, though the results are not announced to the public until the day before the Super Bowl. The sportswriters chosen regularly follow the NFL, and remain mostly consistent from year to year. They are chosen based on expertise and are independent of the league itself. Voters for the award have included Troy Aikman of Fox Sports; Cris Collinsworth and Tony Dungy of NBC Sports; and Herm Edwards of ESPN. The only player to be voted unanimously is Brady, who received all 50 votes for the 2010 season's award.\n\nDue to voters' tendency to favor offensive positions, the award has been overwhelmingly dominated by offensive players; of the 57 undisputed winners, 54 played an offensive position: 38 quarterbacks and 16 running backs. Two defensive players have won the award: Alan Page in 1971 as a defensive tackle, and Lawrence Taylor as a linebacker in 1986. The sole special teams player to be named AP NFL MVP was Mark Moseley, who won as a placekicker in 1982.\n\nThirteen awardees also won the Super Bowl (or NFL Championship Game prior to 1966) in the same season. However, this has not occurred since 1999, when MVP Kurt Warner won Super Bowl XXXIV with the St. Louis Rams. Since then, nine AP NFL MVPs have led their team to the Super Bowl and were defeated each time. This has led to claims in recent years that there is a \"curse\" preventing the awardee's team from winning the Super Bowl.\n\nThe AP has presented an award recognizing the NFL's top player since the 1957 season, although the pre-1961 awardees are recognized in the \"Official NFL Record and Fact Book\" as winning the AP's \"NFL Most Outstanding Player Award\", and the 1962 winner was recognized as the AP's \"Player of the Year\". The AP considers 1961 to be the first year in which it presented a \"Most Valuable Player\" award. Thus there are numerous inconsistencies among sources regarding each of the first four awards, and whether or not the winners are included in the overall list of AP MVP winners at all. The discrepancies include 1958's winner being either Jim Brown or Gino Marchetti; the 1959 winner as Johnny Unitas or Charlie Conerly; and whether or not Norm Van Brocklin shared the award in 1960 with Joe Schmidt.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9941935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9941935", "title": "Bradbury Robinson", "text": "Bradbury Robinson\n\nBradbury Norton Robinson, Jr. (February 1, 1884 – March 7, 1949) was a pioneering American football player, physician, nutritionist, conservationist and local politician. He played college football at the University of Wisconsin in 1903 and at Saint Louis University from 1904 to 1907. In 1904, through personal connections to Wisconsin governor Robert M. La Follette, Sr. and his wife, Belle Case, Robinson learned of calls for reforms to the game of football from President Theodore Roosevelt, and began to develop tactics for passing. After moving to Saint Louis University, Robinson threw the first legal forward pass in the history of American football on September 5, 1906, at a game at Carroll College in Waukesha, Wisconsin. He became the sport's first triple threat man, excelling at running, passing, and kicking. He was also a member of St. Louis' \"Olympic World's Champions\" football team in 1904.\n\nRobinson graduated from Saint Louis University in 1908 with a medical degree and practiced as a surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nIn World War I, he was commissioned a captain of infantry in the U.S. Army, arriving in France in 1918 where he became an instructor in the use of the newly-developed tank, later serving as a front line infantry officer in the last ten days of the war.\n\nHe remained in the Army until September 1919, during which time he studied advanced medical techniques at the University of Bordeaux. In the early 1920s, he oversaw the medical screening of immigrants while serving on the European staff of Hugh S. Cumming, Surgeon General of the United States.\n\nHe returned to the United States in 1926 and practiced medicine in St. Louis, Michigan, where he was twice elected the city's mayor.\n\nIn the 1940s, Robinson was among the first to warn against the dangers of DDT use in agriculture.\n\nAfter Robinson's birth in Bellevue, Ohio and while still a toddler, his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri where Robinson's father, Bradbury Norton Robinson, Sr. (1842–1925), became general baggage agent for the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. The senior Robinson spent most of his adult life working for railroads. Born in Lowell, Massachusetts, he served one year as a sergeant in Company C of the 6th Massachusetts Infantry at the opening of the Civil War. During the Baltimore Riot of April 19, 1861, one week after Fort Sumter, the 6th Massachusetts became the first Union unit to take casualties in action. After his discharge, he moved his family to Missouri in 1862 to participate in the construction of the Missouri Pacific Railroad from St. Louis to Kansas City.\n\nThe younger Robinson was three years old when the family moved again in 1887 to Baraboo, Wisconsin, to be near his mother's family. Amelia Isabella Lee Robinson (1856–1930) was born in London, England and moved with her parents to the Baraboo area in 1878. She married the senior Robinson at her parent's farm in Merrimack, Wisconsin, some 11 miles from Baraboo, in June 1881. Her husband served as Baraboo City Marshal from 1903 to 1904. The Marshal's office was the predecessor to the city's police department.\n\nBrad Jr. and his sisters, Jennie and Nellie, grew up on the Robinsons' small farm across from the Sauk County Fairgrounds. He attended Baraboo public schools and graduated from high school in 1902. Robinson later joked that Baraboo was \"made famous by the Ringling Brothers Circus ... and myself.\" The Circus was founded the same year that Robinson was born.\n\nRobinson was a sixth great-grandson of Mary Bradbury (1615–1700), a convicted Salem witch who escaped execution.\n\nHe was a first cousin four times removed of Bradbury Robinson (1752–1801), who fought for the patriots at Concord in 1775. Generations of Robinson descendants have included males named \"Bradbury\" in honor of the Concord minuteman.\n\nRobinson enrolled at the University of Wisconsin and played for the Badgers varsity team as a freshman in the 1903 season. His arrival was seen by a sports reporter at the time as something of a godsend. Writing on August 23, 1903, the unidentified journalist reported:\n\n... a temporary disappointment, the information that O'Brien, the best candidate for the place of Center Remp, had decided not to return to the university, but had accepted a place for $500 to coach the Appleton high school eleven. The disappointment was cured, however, by the announcement that Robinson, who weighs nearly 200 pounds, had resigned his place at the state insane asylum at Mendota [now part of Madison, Wisconsin] and would enter the football squad in perfect trim, having systematically trained for the past six weeks.\n\nIn Robinson's first and only season at Madison, \"the Cardinal team\" under Arthur Hale Curtis went 6–3–1, suffering shut-out losses to rivals Minnesota and Michigan. Robinson did get a chance to shine in the Badgers' 87–0 defeat of Beloit on October 17, when he scored two touchdowns. A newspaperman wrote, \"Robinson's star work seems to show [the] second eleven is not far behind the first.\"\n\nIn addition to the Ringling brothers and Robinson, another notable person from Baraboo, Wisconsin was Belle Case La Follette (1859–1931). The suffragette and attorney was, according to \"The New York Times\" at the time of her death, \"probably the least known yet most influential of all the American women who had to do with public affairs in this country\". She taught junior high school in Baraboo before marrying future Wisconsin Congressman, Senator, Governor and Presidential candidate Robert M. La Follette, Sr. Mrs. La Follette played an active role in her husband's political career.\n\nIn the spring of 1904, Robinson was summoned by Governor La Follette to the Executive Mansion, which was just a short walk from the U of W campus. In a February 5, 1946 interview with the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"'s Robert Morrison, Robinson recalled that the Governor's \"wife was from my home town and our families were acquainted ... So at the university football practices, where La Follette used to come occasionally, he would often stop to talk to me.\"\n\nEven so, Robinson was puzzled by the Governor's invitation until, \"he showed me a letter from Teddy Roosevelt. There had been a lot of injuries in football and a movement was on foot to abolish the game. Roosevelt wrote that he did not want it wiped out and he thought it was an excellent game for character building, so La Follette asked me 'what do you think can be done to spread the game out and soften it up a bit?' \"\n\nWriting in his memoirs, Robinson remembered suggesting \"increasing the distance to be gained in a set number of downs, to develop the kicking angle and introducing some of the elements of basketball and English Rugby; with perhaps allowing the throwing of the ball forward.\"\n\nSometime later, Robinson \"met with the Governor and he told me to develop handling and throwing the ball because he was sure that eventually there would be changes in the rules along that line.\"\n\nIt was in the preseason of 1904 that Robinson first completely recognized the potential of the pass. Robinson later wrote:\n\n... there came to the Wisconsin U squad a tall young Irishman from Chicago. His name was H.P. Savage, the same who later ... became the National Commander of the American Legion and was known as \"High Power\" Savage. They were trying to develop me into a kicker at Wisconsin and H.P. generally teamed up with me to catch my punts. I noticed that he could throw my punts back almost as far as I could kick them. Here was the trick I must learn. I got H.P. to show me how he did it.\n\nTwenty-five years later, Robinson told \"St. Louis Star-Times\" sports editor Sid Keener (1888–1981) that Savage threw \"the pigskin to his players with the ball revolving as it sailed through the air.\"\n\n\"From then on,\" Robinson wrote in his memoirs, \"my football hobby became forward passing or anyway passing the ball.\"\n\nA short time after Savage instructed him in the art of throwing a spiral, Robinson got in a fight with the \"school bully\" and was dismissed from the Wisconsin football team. Robinson wrote that the incident occurred in the locker room after a practice in which the bully roughly blindsided a teammate. Robinson warned the miscreant not to repeat such unsportsmanlike play. The bully responded by sucker punching Robinson, who proceeded to defend himself with enthusiasm. At that moment, according to Robinson's memoirs, a coach arrived on the scene and incorrectly identified Robinson as the aggressor and dismissed him on the spot. His teammates later explained the situation to the coach, who withdrew the dismissal but refused to give Robinson the apology he demanded.\n\nAbsent the apology, as a matter of honor, Robinson chose to leave Wisconsin, enrolling as a medical student at St. Louis, where he played the 1904 season, although he sat out many games with a broken shoulder blade. More than half the St. Louis squad consisted of future medical doctors.\n\nSoon after arriving in St. Louis, Robinson met 31-year old sportswriter Ed Wray, beginning a professional friendship that would last for the rest of Robinson's life. Wray was sports editor of the \"St. Louis Globe-Democrat\" from 1904 to 1908, which encompassed all of Robinson's playing years. Wray left that post to rejoin the staff at the rival \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", where he had worked as a sports reporter from 1900 to 1904. He remained at that paper as a sports editor and columnist until his retirement in 1955. As an eyewitness to what he considered football history, Wray wrote extensively about Robinson and the development of the forward pass, both contemporaneously and in retrospective columns published over the next four decades.\n\nDr. David C. Todd, an instructor at the SLU Medical Department, served as an official for most St. Louis area games of the period. He remembered that, \"Robinson spoke to me about the pass the fall he joined St. Louis University (1904).\" Wray described Dr. Todd as \"a factor in St. Louis University athletic circles\" who, along with SLU athletic director Father Pat Burke, set out to build up the football program at St. Louis in the early 20th century. In an interview with Wray, Todd remembered that Robinson, \"came to me and told me he thought the forward pass was going to be a great asset. He told me that he had tried it and found he could throw the ball like he could a baseball. I spoke to Father Burke about it in the presence of one of your reporters, also named Burke (the late Miles Joseph Burke), and he was interested.\"\n\nSt. Louis (under head coach Martin J. Delaney) went 11–0 in 1904, outscoring its opponents 336 to 0 that year—including a win over Kentucky by the score of 5–0, the 17–0 victory over Missouri and a 51–0 defeat of Arkansas.\n\nSome argue that St. Louis University won the Olympic gold medal in American football in 1904,\nRobinson's first season at SLU. Both the third Olympic Games of the modern era and the World's Fair were held in St. Louis – and Blue and White games were played before Exposition crowds. The Spalding Athletic Almanac of 1905 offered this commentary:\n\nThe (Olympic) Department knew perfectly well that it would be unable to have an Olympic Foot Ball Championship, though it felt incumbent to advertise it. Owing to the conditions in American colleges it would be utterly impossible to have an Olympic foot ball championship decided. The only college that seemed absolutely willing to give up its financial interests to play for the World's Fair Championship was the St. Louis University and there is more apparently in this honor than appears in this report. There were many exhibition contests held in the Stadium under the auspices of the Department wherein teams from the St. Louis University and Washington University took part and competed against other teams from universities east and west of the Mississippi River. The Missouri–Purdue game was played in the Stadium on October 28 ... The Olympic College Foot Ball Championship was won by St. Louis University, St. Louis, Mo., by default.\n\nLong after transferring to St. Louis, Robinson maintained an unusually close relationship with his former team. He almost convinced the Badgers to make a last minute alteration to their schedule to play an extra game in 1905 ... at St. Louis on December 2. The so-called \"post-season\" game was announced as all but a done deal by \"Post-Dispatch\" writer J. B. Sheridan. Sheridan quoted St. Louis' Father Burke as saying, \"Robinson, our crack halfback, who played with Wisconsin two years ago, is chiefly responsible for Wisconsin's willingness to play here. He is in close touch with the athletic authorities at the Madison school and, knowing of their desire to play one more game this season, arranged the contest with St. Louis University.\" 1905 St. Louis Coach Tommy Dowd said in the same article that the game was not \"definitely arranged\" and, in fact, it never happened.\n\nDowd coached the Blue and White to what was a disappointing 7-2 record in 1905, which led alumni to offer Dowd's predecessor, Martin Delaney, more than twice his previous salary, if he would return to St. Louis. But fate, and Robinson, had other plans.\n\nEach preseason, back home in Wisconsin, Robinson was invited to work out with the Badgers and the development of the pass and possible pass plays continued at that venue. It was at Wisconsin between the 1904 and 1905 seasons that Robinson first met Eddie Cochems, who had become an assistant coach with the Badgers under Curtis in 1904 before spending the 1905 season as the head coach at Clemson. Robinson recalled, \"What I saw at Wisconsin before returning to St. Louis to school convinced me that Edward B. Cochems had an outstanding football system for that time. Actually years ahead of most of the other coaches of that period.\"\n\nAccording to Frank Acker, Robinson's teammate both at Wisconsin and later at St. Louis, Cochems had also spent the 1904 season preparing for the legalization of the forward pass.\n\nAn unidentified St. Louis sportswriter of the period reported that some feared Robinson might return to Wisconsin to play with Cochems there. \"(Robinson) played with Wisconsin two years ago, and might have filled one of the positions in the back field this year if he had not promised to return to the St. Louis University. \"He received several requests from Phil King (who had resumed his position as Wisconsin's head coach) to return to Madison and play on the Badgers, but would not desert his teammates in St. Louis.\"\n\nRobinson simply could not break his word. So, if he wanted to play in Cochems' \"outstanding football system\", Robinson would have to bring the 29-year-old coach to St. Louis ... so that is exactly what he set out to do.\n\nThe pass was officially legalized in the spring of 1906 by the newly created Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS), which became the NCAA in 1910. This was part of the plan to make the game safer that had been undertaken at the behest of President Roosevelt. Robinson wrote:\n\nAfter the season of 1905 was over the Rules Committee put the forward pass and several other things in the rules. This is what I had been waiting for since 1904. I induced my school to hire Mr. Edward B. Cochems to come to St. Louis as coach. He brought with him 3 or 4 outstanding players. With them and what we already had at St. Louis U he developed the team sensation of the country for the two seasons of 1906 and 1907.\n\n\"It was chiefly through Robinson that Cochems, the assistant coach at Wisconsin last year, was engaged by St. Louis University,\" a newspaper at the time confirmed. \"(Robinson) recommended him to the faculty.\"\n\nTo prepare for the first season under the new rules, Cochems convinced the university to allow him to take his team to a Jesuit sanctuary at Lake Beulah in southern Wisconsin for \"the sole purpose of studying and developing the pass.\" Newbery Medal winning author Harold Keith wrote in \"Esquire\" magazine that, in August 1906, Lake Beulah became the birthplace of \"the first, forward pass system ever devised.\"\n\nSome 20 miles from the Lake Beulah training camp, on September 5, 1906, Robinson threw the first pass in a game against Carroll College at Waukesha, Wisconsin. Jack Schneider was the receiver for the Blue & White (St. Louis would not adopt \"Billikens\" as a nickname for its sports teams until sometime after 1910).\n\nAccording to archives at St. Louis, Cochems (pronounced coke-ems) didn't start calling pass plays in the Carroll game until after he had grown frustrated with the failure of his offense to move the ball on the ground.\n\nThe first Robinson-to-Schneider attempt failed to connect. More than 100 years later, Stephen Jones of \"The Press-Enterprise\" called it \"an incompletion that changed the game of football forever.\" Under the rules at that time, an incomplete pass resulted in a turnover to Carroll.\n\nUndeterred, on a subsequent possession, Cochems called for his team to again execute the play he dubbed the \"air attack\". Robinson took the fat, rugby-style ball and threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Schneider. Interviewed in a Jacksonville, Florida hospital room in 1956, Schneider remembered that first pass reception 50 years earlier.\n\nThe play stunned the fans and the Carroll players. St. Louis went on to win, 22–0.\n\nThe 1906 Blue & White squad built its offensive strategy around \"the new rules.\"\n\nAfter returning to St. Louis, Cochems drilled his players relentlessly in long evening practice sessions \"behind closed gates ... in absolute secrecy\" according to one contemporary newspaper account.\n\nRobinson and the tall and speedy Schneider practiced running \"pass routes.\" Their passes were not the awkward heaves typical of the era, but overhand spirals that hit the receiver in stride. They invented their own drills to develop the new skills they would need. Dr. Todd recalled, \"Pike Kenney, Robinson and Schneider got together and began to work on the pass and soon developed amazing proficiency. Robinson and Schneider used to run the side lines throwing the ball clear across the field as they ran.\"\n\n\"Another Cochemesque feature of the practice,\" according to columnist Dan Dillon, \"was his placing his two star forward pass artists — Robinson and Schneider — in front of the big score board in center field (at Sportsman's Park).\" Writing on October 24, 1906, Dillon was astonished that the pair \"actually pitch the oval much after [the] baseball idea at certain marked spots on the board. The accuracy exhibited by those men in throwing the ball was simply marvelous and if some of the Eastern critics who are reputed opposed to the baseball throw for the forward pass could see this pair execute the play it is certain they would change their views.\"\n\nFrank Acker, who had moved from Wisconsin to St. Louis with Cochems and Schneider, explained the impact of the 1906 rules in an interview with Wray published in September 1945:\n\nBy the time of the interview, Acker was, according to Wray, \"a stocky, broad-shouldered 59-year old guy\" ... a retired Southern California physician and real estate investor. But even 39 years distant, the memories of those early days of college football were fresh.\n\nCochems and his charges took it upon themselves to convert the football world to their belief that the forward pass had fundamentally changed the sport.\n\nIn an early November 1906 newspaper interview, Cochems' enthusiasm was evident. \"I think the forward pass is sensational. My men never think of throwing the ball underhand. They throw it overhand as hard as they can.\"\n\n\"It's really a puzzle to me why the other teams are not given new style plays by their coaches,\" Cochems continued. \"[The] Eastern elevens are using nothing but the old-style formations ... It will be a matter of a season or two until the coaches throughout the country come around to my way of thinking or I will be badly mistaken.\"\n\nCochems was, in fact, badly mistaken. The power teams of the East, who dominated the attention of national sportswriters in the early 20th century, were slow to adopt the forward pass. It would be seven years before Knute Rockne began to follow Cochems' example at Notre Dame. But, the slow adoption of his ideas was not for lack of promotional effort by Cochems.\n\nThe coach detailed his concepts in wires and letters to influential men in the sport.\n\nCochems wrote a 10-page article entitled \"The Forward Pass and On-Side Kick\" for the 1907 edition of Spalding's \"How to Play Foot Ball\", edited by the \"Father of American Football\", Walter Camp. The coach explained in words and photographs (of Robinson) how the forward pass could be thrown and how passing skills could be developed. \"[T]he necessary brevity of this article will not permit ... a detailed discussion of the forward pass,\" Cochems lamented. \"Should I begin to explain the different plays in which the pass ... could figure, I would invite myself to an endless task.\"\n\nThe coach even urged the redesign of the football itself ... to make it better fit the passer's hand ... more aerodynamic ... in other words the football we know today.\n\nThe \"Post-Dispatch's\" W.G. Murphy reported on November 7, 1906 that the prostelitizing included indoctrinating the youngest fans: \"In pursuance with Coach Cochems' plan to popularize the new game, Kenney, Schneider, Acker, Robinson and other members of St. Louis U.'s team visited a number of the local schools Monday and addressed the students on the fine points of the game.\"\n\nThe fundamental change to the sport engendered by the introduction of the forward pass was manifest in St. Louis' 1906 Thanksgiving Day game at Sportsman's Park, where the Blue and White hosted the Iowa Hawkeyes. A year earlier on the same field, Iowa had humiliated St. Louis 31–0 (and Robinson had been carried off the field unconscious after a hard tackle).\n\nIn a newspaper article published the morning of the game, an anonymous writer correctly predicted, \"It is to that leader who has grasped the possibilities of the new rules ... that success may come ... Indications point to a style of attack on Iowa's part which is virtually that of last year.\" The analysis continued, \"No team, unless absolutely preponderant in physical strength and speed can hope to win out against an eleven like St. Louis university ... On the other hand, St. Louis U will, in all probability, spring a variety of play that will do to the visitors what it has not failed to do to every other eleven that has played here — bewilder it.\" The prediction could not have been more on the mark; the 12,000 fans in attendance witnessed St. Louis crush the Hawkeyes 39–0.\n\nHall of Fame coach David M. Nelson (1920–1991) considered the Iowa game to be of historic importance. In his book \"The Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game\", Nelson writes that \"eight passes were completed in ten attempts for four touchdowns\" that afternoon. \"The average flight distance of the passes was twenty yards.\"\n\nCoach Nelson continues, \"the last play demonstrated the dramatic effect that the forward pass was having on football. St. Louis was on Iowa's thirty-five-yard line with a few seconds to play. Timekeeper Walter McCormack walked onto the field to end the game when the ball was thrown twenty-five yards and caught on the dead run for a touchdown.\"\n\n\"Cochems said that the poor Iowa showing resulted from its use of the old style play and its failure to effectively use the forward pass\", Nelson writes. \"Iowa did attempt two basketball-style forward passes.\" The morning after the game, Wray wrote that Iowa's \"weak attempt ... at the forward pass ... was an utter failure.\" On the other side of the ball, Wray observed, \"Although Iowa seemed to know just when the (forward pass) was coming, the members of the Hawkeye team seemed to be unable to form a defense capable of stopping it.\n\n\"The use of the forward pass and the versatility of the St. Louis attack seemed to daze the Iowa team,\" Wray concluded. \"Nearly every one of the plays planned this season by Coach Cochems were unloaded in this, the last game of the season, and Iowa looked on enthralled but impotent.\"\n\nThe 1906 Iowa game was refereed by one of the top football officials in the country ... West Point's Lt. H. B. \"Stuffy\" Hackett. He had worked games involving the top Eastern powers that year and, just the Saturday before, had officiated in Chicago where Coach Amos Alonzo Stagg's national defending champion Maroons thrashed Nebraska 38-5. Hackett had played the game himself, quarterbacking the Army Cadets to a 40-5 rout of Navy in 1903. He was the first-ever winner of the Army Athletic Association Award. He would become a member of the American Intercollegiate Football Rules Committee in 1907 and be prominent in the game for the next three decades. Hackett was thus uniquely qualified to compare St. Louis' passing game with what everyone else in the country was doing in 1906. He was quoted the next day in Wray's \"Globe-Democrat\" article: \"It was the most perfect exhibition ... of the new rules ... that I have seen all season and much better than that of Yale and Harvard. St. Louis' style of pass differs entirely from that in use in the east. ... The St. Louis university players shoot the ball hard and accurately to the man who is to receive it ... The fast throw by St. Louis enables the receiving player to dodge the opposing players, and it struck me as being all but perfect.\"\n\nHackett's analysis was reprinted in newspapers across the country, and when it appeared in \"The Washington Post\", the headline screamed: \"FORWARD PASS IN WEST – Lieut. Hackett Says St. Louis University Has Peer of Them All. – Says that Mound City Champions Showed Nearest Approach to Perfect Pass He Has Seen This Year.\"\n\nWray recalled the interview almost 40 years later: \"Hackett told this writer that in no other game that he handled had he seen the forward pass as used by St. Louis U. nor such bewildering variations of it.\"\n\nAccording to the November 19, 1932 \"Minneapolis Star\", Hackett, who officiated games into the 1930s, once said of Robinson, \"Whew, that chap is a wonder! He beats anything I ever saw. He looks as though 40 yards is dead for him, and he's got accuracy with it.\"\n\nNelson, who served as the Secretary-Editor of the NCAA's Football Rules Committee for 29 years, drives home the singular nature of St. Louis' pass attack: \"During the 1906 season [Robinson] threw a sixty-seven yard pass ... and ... Schneider tossed a sixty-five yarder. Considering the size, shape and weight of the ball, these were extraordinary passes.\"\n\nSports historian John Sayle Watterson agreed. In his book, \"College Football: History, Spectacle, Controversy\", Watterson described Robinson's long pass as \"truly a breathtaking achievement.\"\n\nCoach Stagg, who disputed St. Louis' leading role in developing the forward pass, pointed to Robinson's passing prowess as the real difference-maker: \"It might be true that his passer, Robinson, could throw a longer spiral than anyone else for he was a gifted passer. However, Eddie Cochems was not the originator of the long spiral pass.\"\n\nSome credited Robinson with throwing an all-time record 87-yard missile to Schneider earlier that season in St. Louis' 34–2 win over Kansas before a crowd of 7,000 at Sportsman's Park. The distance was not reported in contemporary newspaper accounts but the 1933 \"Spalding's Football Guide\" listed the throw as official ... 87 yards in the air from passer to receiver ... as the \"Ogden Standard-Examiner\" reported in its November 12, 1933 issue:\n\nA detailed account of the play was given by \"New York Evening World\" sports editor and cartoonist Robert W. Edgren as quoted by columnist Joseph \"Roundy\" Coughlin of the \"Wisconsin State Journal\" in 1934:\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", Edgren was \"(e)ven tempered always, well informed in all sports and ... always told the truth ...\", lending credence to his account.\n\nJ. B. Sheridan's game summary the next day in the \"Post-Dispatch\" also indicates that St. Louis did not pass at all until well into the second half. His description of Robinson's long throw matched Edgren's account in many details, although there was no mention of verbal exchanges with Bruner.\n\nOne pass in particular made by Robinson to Schneider, which resulted in a touchdown, was a marvel of distance, accuracy and result. Standing on the 40-yard line, Robinson waited long. Then he threw right in the goal mouth to Schneider, who was tackled instantly, but fell across the touch line for a score. It was a wonderful play. How they handled the clumsy football on the throw, just as if it were a baseball, surprised me.\n\nSheridan chose to close his article by citing this \"marvel\" of a play – after making reference to earlier 20 and 40-yard passes by St. Louis. If Robinson was standing at \"his own\" 40 yard line when he made the throw, with the 110-yard field of the day, the pass would have traveled about 70 yards in the air.\nDan Dillon's \"How the Game Was Played\" in the \"Post-Dispatch\" the next morning gave no yardage details but he wrote that, \"(a)t this magnificent exhibition of the spectacular forward pass the crowd went wild and Kansas was plainly up in the air on account of the machine-like method with which it was executed for such material gains.\"\n\nSLU team captain Clarence \"Pike\" Kenney (later head football coach at Creighton and Marquette) wrote in the 1907 SLU yearbook that the longest pass of the 1906 season was \"a record 48 yards.\" Nevertheless, he confirmed the 87-yard distance in a 1937 newspaper interview.\n\nRobert Ripley highlighted the toss in his famous \"Ripley's Believe It or Not\" newspaper feature in 1945.\n\nOn October 15, 1947, the \"St. Louis Star and Times\" referred to the play as \"a record that still stands.\"\n\nA Northwestern University football program from the same year lists the 87-yard pass as one of the \"Record Scoring Plays of All Time.\" It also credits \"the late football chronicler Parke H. Davis\" as its source.\n\nRecord-setting or not, Robinson's passing against the Jayhawkers impressed \"The Kansas City Times\" in a post-game analysis: \"The forward pass was perhaps the most effective of (St. Louis') new plays which they used against Kansas. This was started from the punting formation. Robinson, an end, going back to pass the ball. Instead of making the usual basket-ball throw of the oval, however, he shot it straight forward in the same manner as he would throw a baseball, and wonderful indeed was the speed and accuracy with which it would fall into the hands of the backs waiting down the field.\"\n\nProfessor Watterson wrote that, \"Robinson ended up using passes that ranged from thirty to more than forty yards with devastating efficiency\".\n\nIn their book \"Coaching Football\", Super Bowl-winning player and coach Tom Flores and longtime coach Bob O'Connor report that \"Robinson ... was credited with several 50-yard completions in 1906.\" \n\nIn the build-up to the 1906 game with Iowa, the \"Post-Dispatch\" reported that Robinson could \"throw the oval 65 yards.\"\n\nCoach Nelson related that some observers chalked up Robinson's passing prowess to an anatomical advantage. \"St. Louis had a great passer in Brad Robinson,\" Nelson observed. \"He had huge and boney hands, which led other coaches in the area to conclude that it was not possible to excel as a passer without these attributes. Having a passer without huge, boney hands was reason enough not to have an aerial game.\"\n\nRobinson believed his physical advantage was the result of accident as well as genes. He credited his uncanny ability to throw long and accurate passes in part to a crooked little finger on his throwing (right) hand that was the result of a childhood injury. The misshapen pinkie helped impart a natural spiral to his tosses.\n\nReporters of the era also noted Robinson's disciplined preparation, in terms of his drills and workouts. Even when Robinson was in his sixties, his right arm was much more heavily muscled than his left, a testament to years of repeated exercise and practice.\n\nThe Blue & White cruised to an 11-0 record in 1906. Cochems and company led the nation in scoring, collectively outscoring their opponents 407–11.\n\nIn an October 1947 \"Wray's Column,\" the \"Post-Dispatch\" editor wrote:\n\n... the football world in general and the college and professional treasuries in particular are indebted to Cochems and Robinson and St. Louis University ... That's because the tremendous rise of gridiron interest everywhere can be traced directly of the Cochems–Robinson forward passing and to the improved spectacle it has made of this fine and manly game.\n\nSLU compiled a record of 7-3-1 in 1907 and was named Varsity-Trans-Mississippi Champion. The highlight of the season was a 34–0 thrashing of the Nebraska Cornhuskers on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nCochems introduced another innovation at St. Louis that season, having his team wear numbers on their uniforms to allow spectators to identify individual players. The move was called \"a decided innovation\" and was compared to the numbering of jockeys in horse racing.\n\nThe Blue and White traveled to the West Coast for a Christmas Day game against Washington State College, which St. Louis lost 11–0.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the season, and even though most of his team consisted of medical students like Robinson and Schneider, charges were made that Cochems was using professional players. Several Midwestern universities, including Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Wisconsin, refused to schedule games with St. Louis for the 1908 season, \"claiming the team is tainted with professionals.\"\n\nBrad Robinson was not only St. Louis' premier passer. He was also the Blue & White's principal kicker. One sports journalist of the time opined that, \"of the local kickers, Robinson of St. Louis easily excels all others. He is good for at least 45 yards every time he puts his toe to the ball and some of his punts have gone 60 yards.\"\n\nWatching a St. Louis practice in 1906, journalist Dillon observed Robinson \"kicking in fine form and with a slight wind behind him, was dropping them over regularly from the 45-yard line and was averaging close to 50 yards on his punts.\"\n\nRobby's prowess as a ballcarrier was particularly noted by a reporter after a November 11, 1904 victory over the University of Missouri at Columbia: \"Robinson and (John) Kinney, the halfbacks of the visiting team were the fastest seen here in years and the Tigers seemed unable to stop them.\" Another writer at the game observed that Robinson's \"offensive play was fast and in running back punts he gained much ground for his team, besides tackling well while on defensive.\" The \"St. Louis Globe-Democrat\" added, \"Robinson's return of punts electrified the spectators time and time again. He was always good for a gain of 20 yards or more.\"\n\nYears before the term was commonly used by sportswriters, Bradbury Robinson had become the sport's first triple threat. Writing in October 1947, Ed Wray declared that the title belonged to Robinson.\n\nWe believe that Robinson also was the first triple-threat man in history because throughout the [1906] season Cochems used Robinson to pass, kick and run the ball ... He was an A1 punter, too ... And run! ... This three way use of Robby added greatly to the team's offensive deception.\"\n\nIn addition to his exploits on the football field, Robinson was also a standout in baseball and track and field for the Blue & White, and was elected captain of both teams.\n\nUpon his election as captain of the 1907 baseball team, the \"Post-Dispatch\" reported that\n\nAt the time of Robinson's election as track captain, a local writer reported:\n\nDespite his own admirable performance, Robinson's team was not a winner that night ... a loss he attributed to \"overconfidence\" and \"poor luck.\" \"Murray, the crack dash man, was left at his mark owing to the poor service of the pistol,\" Robinson explained after the meet. \"The gun failed to go off three times in succession and when the report finally came it took most of the men unaware and the heat was run in slow time.\"\n\nIn both 1906 and 1907 Robinson and his teammates were the Western AAU Indoor relay champions.\n\nRobinson pursued pre-med studies at Wisconsin before enrolling as a medical student at Saint Louis in 1904, where he earned his bachelor of science and medical degrees in 1908. He was elected to lead SLU's chapter of the Chi Zeta Chi Medical Society (which merged with Phi Rho Sigma in 1929). and was a member of the Phi Beta Pi \"anti-fraternity\" professional society.\n\nAfter graduation, Robinson interned at a local hospital and served as Cochems' assistant coach the following fall, in what was the last year in St. Louis for them both. The Blue and White compiled a record of 7–2–1 in 1908, defeating the Arkansas Razorbacks (24–0), but losing to Pitt (13–0) and to Jim Thorpe and the Carlisle Indian School (17–0).\n\nRobinson then moved to Rochester, Minnesota, where he practiced surgery at the Mayo Clinic's St. Mary's Hospital for the next two years.\n\nOn March 7, 1910, he married Melissa Louise Mills, a strikingly beautiful St. Louis girl, who died just four years later. Their only child, Bradbury N. Robinson, III, was raised by his paternal grandparents. Like his father, he played college football, wearing number 51 as a standout end for the Minnesota Golden Gophers from 1931 to 1933 and was a member of one of the All-America squads in 1931–32. He was chosen for the 1933 East–West Shrine Game played in San Francisco and he played for the East All-Stars in the Century of Progress International Exposition game at Soldier Field in Chicago that same year. He was also a forward on the Gophers basketball team, serving as its captain in 1932–33. \nAfter graduation, Brad Robinson, III, went into the advertising business. He also served as an analyst on college football broadcasts, one season being teamed with play-by-play man Ronald Reagan.\n\nUpon the United States' entry into World War I, Brad Robinson, Jr. enlisted and was sent to the First Officers Training Camp at Ft. Sheridan. There he won his commission as a captain of infantry on August 15, 1917. He was then assigned to the command of Company L, 340th Infantry Regiment of the 85th Division. He was sent overseas in July 1918.\n\nIn France, he became an instructor at the Inter-Allied Tank School in Recloses, until his battalion was ordered to the front on November 1, 1918, ten days before the Armistice.\n\nAfter the war, Robinson elected to remain in France to pursue post-graduate work. He met Yvonne Marie Dewachter (1898–1966) in 1919 while both were students at the University of Bordeaux. Dewachter was the elder daughter of one of Western Europe's leading merchants – and a renowned landscape painter – Louis Dewachter (\"nom d'artiste\" Louis Dewis). While Robinson spoke hardly a word of French, Yvonne Dewachter was fluent in English. A courtship ensued and the couple were married on August 12, 1919 in Paris, a month before Robinson received his discharge from the Army. They had seven children: Lois, Nadine, Richard, Janine, Yveline, Jacqueline and Corrine.\n\nThe growing family moved from one European city to another as Robinson continued clinical studies across the continent from 1920 to 1926, while serving as a surgeon on the staff of Hugh S. Cumming, Surgeon General of the United States. These included stays in Leeds, Liverpool, and London, England; Rotterdam, Holland; Antwerp, Belgium; Bordeaux, Le Havre, Nantes, Paris, and Poitiers, France; Edinburgh, Scotland; and Dublin, Ireland.\n\nCumming had been ordered to Europe to study the sanitary conditions of the ports to prevent the introduction of disease into the United States by returning troops. He also inaugurated a plan for the medical inspection of immigrants abroad in the principal countries of origin. Robinson played a role in both programs. \"The New York Times\" reported his arrival in New York City for a visit to the States in 1922:\n\nRobinson and his family moved to the United States to stay in 1926, locating to St. Louis, Michigan in September of that year. He was drawn to the small city because of its natural mineral-rich water, which he believed would play an important role in his naturopathic and holistic medical practice. A frequent author on medical matters, he opened the Robinson Clinic in St. Louis in 1935, where he stressed a natural diet, cleansing, exercise and weight control. He cited the increased use of refined sugar as a particular threat to good health, an idea scoffed at during his lifetime and decades later, but an observation supported by an exhaustive study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2014 and reported by the Harvard Heart Magazine that year and in 2016.\n\nIn 1947, Robinson became one of the earliest to warn of the dangers of using the pesticide DDT in agriculture. This was a radical view at the time, especially in St. Louis, Michigan. Beginning in 1944, DDT had been researched and manufactured in St. Louis by the Michigan Chemical Corporation, later purchased by Velsicol Chemical Corporation. DDT had become an important part of the local economy.\n\nCiting research performed by Michigan State University in 1946, Robinson, a past president of the local Conservation Club, opined that:\n\n... perhaps the greatest danger from D.D.T. is that its extensive use in farm areas is most likely to upset the natural balances, not only killing beneficial insects in great number but by bringing about the death of fish, birds, and other forms of wild life either by their feeding on insects killed by D.D.T. or directly by ingesting the poison.\n\nSome 15 years passed before the dangers of DDT were the subject of Rachel Carson's 1962 landmark book, \"Silent Spring\". DDT's use in agriculture was banned worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe Gratiot County Landfill just outside St. Louis, in which some of the chemicals from the DDT-producing plant had been disposed, became an Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site in the 1970s. The local population assumed the problem had been solved. But, in 1994, samples of the riverbed taken next to the former chemical plant site revealed that it was still 4% DDT. A local task force pressured the EPA into cleaning up the adjacent waterway, an effort that was still ongoing in 2017, 70 years after Dr. Robinson had published his warning.\n\nHe was a member of the Baptist church, a Knight Templar, a 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason, a Knight of Pythias, an Odd Fellow, and a post commander of the American Legion.\n\nDr. Robinson was a Republican and attended state conventions of that party. He was twice elected mayor of St. Louis, Michigan, in 1931 and 1937.\n\nRobinson died at the Veterans Hospital in Bay Pines, Florida in 1949 from complications following routine surgery. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nRobinson was inducted into the St. Louis Billiken Hall of Fame in 1995. In 2009, \"SI.com\" and \"Sports Illustrated Kids\" listed Cochems' development of the forward pass and Robinson's historic touchdown pass to Schneider as the first of 13 \"Revolutionary Moments in Sports.\" In 2010, \"Complex\" magazine recognized Robinson as the \"Best Player\" on the 1906 St. Louis squad, which the publication ranked among \"The 50 Most Badass College Football Teams\" in history, placing the Blue and White at 38th. \"Complex\" said it chose the teams based on \"style, guts, amazing plays, and players and coaches that did things that just hadn't been done before.\" In 2011, Amy Lamare, writing on Bleacher Report, named St. Louis' 1906 game at Carroll College one of \"The 50 Most Historically Significant Games in College Football.\"\n\n"}

He began his career in art training under the eminent Edinburgh portrait painter Sir Henry Raeburn. He went to Rome for six months, and on return spent the majority of his working life in Edinburgh, having his studio at 19 Scotland Street. Lees also taught drawing.\n\nIn the 1830s \"Charles Lees, portrait painter\" is listed as living at 9 Elder Street in Edinburgh's New Town.\n\nHe died in Edinburgh on 20 February 1880 and was buried with his wife Elizabeth Christie of Baberton, and their children, in Warriston Cemetery. The grave stands on the north side of the main east-west path in the upper section.\n\nCharles Lees achieved initial renown as a portrait painter, his accomplishments leading to his election to the Royal Scottish Academy in 1830. He later served as the Academy's Treasurer.\nLees is perhaps best known for his work specialising in sporting and recreational subjects, particularly golfing and curling, to which he turned from the 1840s.\n\nIn 1847 Lees completed his depiction of the 1844 grand match at St Andrews in an oil painting, \"The Golfers\", which has been cited as being \"the most famous golfing work of art in the world.\" It shows the annual autumn meeting of October 1844, the scene being set at the 'Ginger Beer Hole' on the Old Course at St Andrews.

{"id": "47923662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47923662", "title": "Clutch (sports)", "text": "Clutch (sports)\n\nClutch performance in sports is the phenomenon of athletes under pressure, usually in the last minutes of a game, to summon strength, concentration and whatever else necessary to succeed, to perform well, and perhaps change the outcome of the game. It occurs in basketball, hockey, football, esports, and other sports. The opposite is \"choking\": failing to perform as needed, when under pressure.\n\nIt is a phenomenon that is studied in psychology and in the more specialized area of sport psychology. The term gained popularity due to repetitive use among sports commentators, particularly baseball announcers. Consequently, a portion of the academic literature is focused on baseball, more specifically on clutch hitting, and addresses the academic issue of whether it exists or not.\n\nA great deal of the academic literature shows that is important for athletes to be able to control their anxiety if they are to produce peak performances in clutch moments.\n\nEarly academic literature presents evidence for the clutch player in the Yerkes-Dodson Law. In this 1908 study, psychologists, Robert Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson, found that stress, or arousal (pressure), increases performance to an extent, but too much or too little stress causes a decline in performance. The level of pressure necessary for maximum efficiency increases due to task, with those tasks requiring endurance and stamina being completed with higher levels of arousal. A bell curve is often used to represent the relationship between pressure and performance as indicated by empirical evidence. The Yerkes-Dodson Law suggests that arousal has positive effects on cognitive processes such as motivation, attention, and concentration. In effect, an athlete should be able to play at an elevated level with adequate amount of pressure. Further research is necessary in order to more clearly define the effects of momentum on a player′s in-game performance.\n\nThe Yerkes-Dodson Law spurred further research into its direct application in athletics. As a result, Sport psychologist, Yuri L. Hanin, developed the Zone of Optimal Functioning theory, which states, ″In order for an athlete to perform to their highest capability, they must experience their preferred level of anxiety.″ Hanin used a sport-specific version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory to measure the cognitive and somatic anxiety levels of each player before his or her performance. Hanin determined that each player has a certain range of pre-performance anxiety which leads to optimal performance. Hanin later postulates the functional relationship between emotions and optimal performance differs between each individual based on emotional factors, thus the revised version was called the Individual Zone of Optimal Functioning (IZOF). The newer model better accounts for ″the multidimensionality of emotional constructs″ by accounting for both positive and negative affect in athletes prior to the beginning of the sporting event. The study confirmed the existence of an ″association of the intensity of pre-competition state anxiety to optimal athletic performance.″ \nA majority of elite athletes perform personalized pre-game rituals in order to mentally prepare themselves for gameplay. Players may revert to these rituals immediately before the clutch moment so as to stabilize cognitive and [somatic anxiety] in order to revert to their individual zone of optimal functioning. This type of self-control is what leads to the ability to excel in the clutch.\nHardy et al. (1996) researched the psychological preparation of elite athletes and found that \"Cognitive-behavioral interventions are effective for the purposes of performance enhancement.\" A number of cognitive-behavioral therapies have since been incorporated into the field of athletics in order to help athletes self-regulate their anxiety during sporting events. One of the most common techniques used is mental visualization. Miguel Humara explains that ″Imagery and mental rehearsal of tasks are beneficial for the individual seeking to improve athletic performance. These tactics provide familiarity with the task at hand and also provide positive feedback of their imagined performance.″ Mental visualization allows elite athletes, who are consciously aware of his or her abilities, to complete the task more naturally and with higher coordination. Players are able to boost self-confidence by picturing themselves taking the shot, hitting, throwing, or catching the ball, etc. before the play actually occurs. \nThe situation presented here is ideal when a stoppage of play, such as a timeout, occurs directly before the clutch moment. The timeout situation allows coaches to make adjustments and call plays uniquely designed for late-game situations. Players have often simulated and successfully completed multiple repetitions of the shot or play in practices throughout the season and preseason. In team sports, the previous exposure to the situation at hand, even if only simulated, allows the group to understand the plan and act cohesively when executing. On the individual level, mental visualization enables a player, before action even resumes, to focus on the mechanics and techniques necessary to achieve a favorable outcome. The player may consider situational factors, such as a specific angle and motion to utilize or a speed at which he or she must accelerate. For Kobe Bryant, this may mean making sure that he extends his leg when shooting his signature fade away jumper.\n\nClutch situations are commonly defined from an offensive perspective, but clutch moments may also come in the form of defensive plays. Coaches of the defending team often use the tactic of calling one timeout immediately following another late-game timeout. The latter of the two is called after the players have entered into the playing area but before play resumes, allowing the coaching staff to see how the opposing team sets up their offense and giving them an opportunity to scheme a defensive tactic that gives their team the best opportunity to win. Teams then execute the gameplan and are sometimes able to make remarkable comebacks.\nIn the 2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, the Texas A&M Aggies made an improbable comeback against the Northern Iowa Panthers. The Aggies’ defense forced four turnovers while their offense scored 14 points, all in less than 35 seconds. The 14-2 scoring run tied the game at the end of regulation, although the Aggies had only about a 1-in-3,333 chance of winning just 44 seconds of gameplay earlier. The game extended into double overtime where Texas A&M claimed a 99-88 victory over Northern Iowa.\n\nStatistical Analysis has vastly improved with the evolution of technology. Today, computer software allows statisticians to track, analyze, and compare a broad range of statistics, even in terms of specific game situations. Sports organizations, such as the National Football League, have entire branches devoted to analytics. Sports analytic researchers use sports science to present data on optimal practice lengths and days of rests. During gameplay, they also communicate directly with the coaching staff to make game decisions based on present and potential situations, which can be especially important when determining the play call for the clutch play. Statistical analysis researchers are able to assess the current game situation given data from recent (within the same game) and historical (earlier in the season or in previous seasons) games. Researchers provide information pertaining to where specific players are most effective in a given situation, such as in the clutch. Therefore, they can provide coaches with empirical evidence for choosing certain plays and present them with the probability of alternative options. Statistical analysis helps to highlight the significance of clutch moments. ESPN's \"Sport Science\" host, John Brenkus analyzes hundreds of moments, players, and performances in the world of sports. Players across a number of sports recreate sports circumstances in a lab-like setting. Sport Science simulates in-game situations in a lab-like setting and analyzes, from a scientific perspective, individual aspects of the player's performance, probability of success given the circumstances, and additional influencing factors.\n\n\n"}

Highly teamwork oriented, the game was played between two teams of usually 12 to 14 players each, with one ball and the rules of the game which allowed using hands. Although it was a ball game, it was violent, at least in Sparta. The teams would try to throw the ball over the heads of the other team. There was a white line called the \"skuros\" between the teams and another white line behind each team. Teams would change the ball often until one of the team was forced behind the line at their end. In Sparta a form of \"episkyros\" was played during an annual city festival that included five teams of 14 players. It was played primarily by men but women also practiced it. The Greek game of \"episkyros\" (or a similar game called - \"phaininda\", probably meaning \"deceiving game\", from the verb - \"phenakizo\", \"(I) cheat, lie\") was later adopted by the Romans, who renamed and transformed it into \"harpastum\", the latinisation of the Greek (\"harpaston\"), neuter of (\"harpastos\"), \"carried away\", from the verb (\"harpazo\"), \"(I) seize, snatch\".\n\nA depiction in low relief on the belly of the vase displayed at the National Archaeological Museum, Athens. shows a Greek athlete balancing a ball on his thigh.

Journalist Matt Williams stated that being a gay professional player in football is still a taboo, which journalist Simon Barnes has said will never change. In February 2013, football magazine \"When Saturday Comes\" described homosexuality as a \"continuing taboo\" in the sport. John Amaechi, the first NBA player to come out, has blamed football's \"toxic\" culture for the lack of openly gay players, while Clarke Carlisle has called for more education to be given to players to combat homophobia.\n\nRicharlyson was named on Brazilian television as a homosexual by the manager of a rival team. When Richarlyson undertook legal action, the complaint was thrown out by the judge, who stated \"football was a virile masculine sport and not a homosexual one.\"\n\nIn 2006, PFC Levski Sofia president Todor Batkov felt it acceptable to call referee Mike Riley a \"British homosexual\", following Riley's controversial sending off of Cedric Bardon during the UEFA Cup quarterfinal game against Schalke 04.\n\nAnders Lindegaard is one of the few footballers to have spoken out against the intolerance of homosexuality in football and the absence of openly gay players from the professional game. In a 2012 blog entry the Manchester United goalkeeper wrote: \n\nThe prominent gay rights activist Peter Tatchell joined a Football Association campaign against homophobia in football, but later left stating the organisation does not take the matter seriously.\n\nThe gay rights group Stonewall published a report in August 2009 which described English football as \"institutionally homophobic.\"\n\nEven heterosexual players, such as Graeme Le Saux and Sol Campbell, have been the victim of homophobic abuse; Le Saux by fellow player Robbie Fowler, and Campbell by opposing supporters.\n\nThe Gay Football Supporters Network was founded in 1989 to campaign for gay rights in English football, and it currently organises the GFSN National League, a league consisting of gay teams. Stonewall Football Club is currently Britain's highest ranking gay football team, are on the verge of going semi-professional.\n\nIn August, 2010, Hope Powell, the coach of the England women's team, was named in 68th place on \"The Independent\" newspaper's Pink List of influential lesbian and gay people in the UK.\n\nIn December 2011, a Southampton fan was banned for three years for homophobic chanting.\n\nGerman player Thomas Hitzlsperger stated in January 2014 that he thought it would be a long time before there was an openly gay player in the English Premier League. John Ruddy later stated that openly gay players would be supported in England. Later that month it was revealed that Liam Davis, a non-league player with Gainsborough Trinity, has been out for four years; he is the country's only openly gay semi-professional player.\n\nIn February 2014 it was revealed that only 11 of the Premier League's 20 teams, and only 17 of the Football League's 72 teams, had joined the 'Football v Homophobia' campaign.\n\nCasey Stoney, captain of the England women's team, came out in February 2014.\n\nIn April 2014 Colin Kazim-Richards was found guilty of making a homophobic gesture at Brighton fans.\n\nIn August 2014 Malky Mackay and Iain Moody were accused of sending each other racist, sexist and homophobic text messages. Moody left his job as sporting director of Crystal Palace as a result. Mackay apologised for the texts. The League Manager's Association defended Mackay, claiming that the texts were merely \"banter\"; the LMA had to later apologise for this as well. Mackay later denied being racist, sexist or homophobic.\n\nJustin Fashanu, older brother of fellow footballer John Fashanu, was the first professional footballer to come out as gay, after he agreed to an exclusive with \"The Sun\" tabloid newspaper on 22 October 1990. Fashanu claimed to have had an affair with a married Conservative MP who he first met in a London gay bar. A week later, John Fashanu publicly distanced himself from his brother, describing Justin as an \"outcast\", while Justin's manager Brian Clough famously described him as a \"bloody poof.\"\n\nFashanu was interviewed for the July 1991 cover story of \"Gay Times\", and Fashanu revealed that no club had offered him a full-time contract since the story first appeared.\n\nIn the morning of 3 May 1998, he was found hanged in a deserted lock-up garage he had broken into, in Shoreditch, London, after visiting Chariots Roman Spa, a local gay sauna.

The club's highest profile supporter from within the professional game has been former France national football team player Vikash Dhorasoo (who is heterosexual) whilst a number of leading French professional clubs have signed their charter against homophobia. The club ran into controversy in 2009 however when an amateur side Creteil Bebel refused to play them due to the \"principles\" of Paris Foot Gay.\n\nThe issue returned to the spotlight in 2010 when amateur FC Chooz refused to register Yoann Lemaire, who had been with the club for 14 years, due to him being gay as they claimed it might lead to \"trouble\" with his teammates.\n\nThe Hamburger SV (HSV) player (1947–1991) was the first Bundesliga player to be publicly known as being gay, but only after his death. He played for HSV from 1970 to 1973. He was murdered in his flat in Hannover on 5 December 1991, apparently by a male prostitute, according to police investigators, although the crime has never been solved. The historian Werner Skrentny has said at the time Bonn was playing, journalists had little interest in the private lives of footballers and it would have been unthinkable for him to come out. Today, HSV has is own official LGBT fan club. Blue Pride was founded in 2006. It was renamed Volksparkjunxx in 2012.\n\nMarcus Urban, born 1971, played with the East German national youth football team and as an amateur in the second division club Rot-Weiß Erfurt. From the age of 13, he had been hot-housed at a specialist sports boarding school in Erfurt but at the age of 20, in 1991, when he was about to become a professional footballer, he gave up the sport. He came out to friends and family in 1994, and in 2007 publicly spoke to the media about his homosexuality and the difficulties that gay footballers experience. He said that the pressure of having to pretend to be something he wasn't 24 hours a day was too much for him. He became widely known after a biography titled \"Versteckspieler: Die Geschichte des schwulen Fußballers Marcus Urban\" ('Hidden Player: the story of the gay footballer Marcus Urban') was published in 2008.\n\nUrban is now a spokesperson and campaigner on diversity issues in sport and the workplace. He advises the German Olympic Sports Confederation and the Sports Committee of the German Federal Parliament, as well as businesses and non-profit institutions.\n\nIn December 2006, \"Rund\" magazine published an interview done over a two-year period with two gay footballers living secret lives. One was married and said his wife did not know of his sexual orientation nor realise he was involved in an intimate relationship with his childhood friend. The other often brought a female friend to social events.\n\nIn March 2010, former manager Rudi Assauer said that \"If a player came to me and said he was gay I would say to him: 'You have shown courage'. But then I would tell him to find something else to do. That's because those who out themselves always end up busted by it, ridiculed by their fellow players and by people in the stands. We should spare them these witch hunts.\"\n\nOn 8 January 2014 Thomas Hitzlsperger, who had retired from professional football in September 2013, announced that he was gay. Before coming out, in September 2012, Hitzlsperger had publicly spoken about players coming out. In September 2014 he said that he believed the sport was tackling homophobia.\n\nIn April 2009, former Dordrecht'90 striker John de Bever married his manager and friend Kees Stevens. De Bever played at the 1996 FIFA Futsal World Championship and was named World Futsal player of the year in 1997.\n\nThomas Berling retired from professional football after coming out in 2000, citing widespread homophobia in the football community as the reason.\n\nSeveral female players have come out as homosexual, including Bente Nordby and Linda Medalen.\n\nIn June 2015, a Bærum SK player was given a straight red card for calling his Sandnes Ulf opponent \"gay\" in a Norwegian First Division match.\n\nIn October 2016, Stabæk Fotball became the first European club to host a pride parade before their home fixture against Sarpsborg 08. Since then, a parade has been held before one of the team's home fixtures every season.\n\nEudy Simelane, who played for the South Africa women's national football team, was an openly lesbian player who was raped and murdered.\n\nThe first gay and lesbian football supporters' group to be officially accepted by a Spanish club was founded in February 2009, and supports FC Barcelona.\n\nA popular football chant in Spanish stadiums is \"maricón\", which translates as \"faggot.\"\n\nSpanish women's international Laura del Río is a lesbian.\n\nAnton Hysén, son of former Sweden international Glenn Hysén, came out in March 2011 as gay whilst playing for Utsiktens BK, then a Swedish football Division 2 side.\n\nHalil İbrahim Dinçdağ was a referee with the Turkey Football Federation for 13 years, but was sacked from this position due to his homosexuality. The Trabzon Board of Referees and the Turkish Football Association decided that he was not eligible for the role as he was previously excused from the military service for being homosexual. The Board of Referees came to this conclusion by upholding the private statue of the association, which states that people who do not complete their military duties due to a mental illness (including homosexuality) are not eligible to be a referee, although normally homosexuality is not considered as such by the Turkish constitution.\n\nOne of Turkey's famous football commentators, Erman Toroğlu, argued that he should not be given his referee position back due to the professional reasons such as the possibility for making wrong decisions related to his homosexuality.\n\nIn an interview with the Turkish journalist Canan Danyıldız, one of the famous Turkish football managers, Yılmaz Vural, was asked about the presence of LGBT people in Turkish football. He said that although he has never witnessed any homosexual interaction in the locker rooms, he knows that there exist gay football players in the Turkish League. He added that he does not believe homosexuality inhibits the talents of the players and that everyone should be free to live their personal lives the way that they want to. He finalized his words by saying that gay Turkish football players can never come out of the closet since everyone knows about the case of the former referee Dinçdağ.\n\nAnother important interview about LGBT people in Turkish Football was held between the journalist Elif Korap and the famous former football player and present football commentator Rıdvan Dilmen. When he was asked whether or not he knew of any gay Turkish football players, his answer was straightforward: \"Of course, as there are in any other profession.\" Dilmen criticized other people in the Turkish football industry for not admitting the presence of LGBT people, since they are afraid of being considered as homosexual as well. Although Dilmen said that he does not approve the discrimination against the LGBT people in the Turkish football, on contrary, he argued that he would still disinherit his own kid for being gay once he was reminded about a negative comment he made during an interview in 1989.\n\nFormer MLS player David Testo, having been released by Montreal Impact the previous month, affirmed he was gay in an interview on with the French Canadian division of Radio Canada that was published on November 10, 2011.\n\nOn February 15, 2013, midfielder Robbie Rogers, who had been released by Leeds United a few weeks earlier, came out after announcing his retirement from professional football. Rogers later stated that being openly gay was \"impossible\" in the sport. He has since returned to football, signing a \"multi-year\" contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy. Rogers stated in December 2013 that he had not received any contact from other, secretly, gay players.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "74711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74711", "title": "Horse racing", "text": "Horse racing\n\nHorse racing is an equestrian performance sport, typically involving two or more horses ridden by jockeys (or sometimes driven without riders) over a set distance for competition. It is one of the most ancient of all sports, as its basic premise – to identify which of two or more horses is the fastest over a set course or distance – has been unchanged since at least classical antiquity.\n\nHorse races vary widely in format and many countries have developed their own particular traditions around the sport. Variations include restricting races to particular breeds, running over obstacles, running over different distances, running on different track surfaces and running in different gaits.\n\nWhile horses are sometimes raced purely for sport, a major part of horse racing's interest and economic importance is in the gambling associated with it, an activity that in 2008 generated a worldwide market worth around US$115 billion.\n\nHorse racing has a long and distinguished history and has been practised in civilisations across the world since ancient times. Archaeological records indicate that horse racing occurred in Ancient Greece, Babylon, Syria, and Egypt. It also plays an important part of myth and legend, such as the contest between the steeds of the god Odin and the giant Hrungnir in Norse mythology.\n\nChariot racing was one of the most popular ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine sports. Both chariot and mounted horse racing were events in the ancient Greek Olympics by 648 BC and were important in the other Panhellenic Games. It continued although chariot racing was often dangerous to both driver and horse, which frequently suffered serious injury and even death. In the Roman Empire, chariot and mounted horse racing were major industries. From the mid-fifteenth century until 1882, spring carnival in Rome closed with a horse race. Fifteen to 20 riderless horses, originally imported from the Barbary Coast of North Africa, were set loose to run the length of the Via del Corso, a long, straight city street; their time was about 2½ minutes.\n\nIn later times, Thoroughbred racing became, and remains, popular with aristocrats and royalty of British society, earning it the title \"Sport of Kings\".\n\nHistorically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and displayed the excellent horsemanship needed in battle. Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. The various forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.\n\nThere are many different types of horse racing, including:\n\n\nDifferent breeds of horses have developed that excel in each of the specific disciplines. Breeds that are used for flat racing include the Thoroughbred, Quarter Horse, Arabian, Paint, and Appaloosa. Jump racing breeds include the Thoroughbred and AQPS. In harness racing, Standardbreds are used in Australia, New Zealand and North America, when in Europe, Russian and French Trotter are used with Standardbred. Light cold blood horses, such as Finnhorses and Scandinavian coldblood trotter are also used in harness racing within their respective geographical areas.\n\nThere also are races for ponies: both flat and jump and harness racing.\n\nFlat racing is the most common form of racing seen worldwide. Flat racing tracks are typically oval in shape and are generally level, although in Great Britain and Ireland there is much greater variation, including figure of eight tracks like Windsor and tracks with often severe gradients and changes of camber, such as Epsom Racecourse. Track surfaces vary, with turf most common in Europe, dirt more common in North America and Asia, and newly designed synthetic surfaces, such as Polytrack or Tapeta, seen at some tracks.\n\nIndividual flat races are run over distances ranging from up to , with distances between five and twelve furlongs being most common. Short races are generally referred to as \"sprints\", while longer races are known as \"routes\" in the United States or \"staying races\" in Europe. Although fast acceleration (\"a turn of foot\") is usually required to win either type of race, in general sprints are seen as a test of speed, while long distance races are seen as a test of stamina. The most prestigious flat races in the world, such as the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Melbourne Cup, Japan Cup, Epsom Derby, Kentucky Derby and Dubai World Cup, are run over distances in the middle of this range and are seen as tests of both speed and stamina to some extent.\n\nIn the most prestigious races, horses are generally allocated the same weight to carry for fairness, with allowances given to younger horses and female horses running against males. These races are called conditions races and offer the biggest purses. There is another category of races called handicap races where each horse is assigned a different weight to carry based on its ability. Beside the weight they carry, horses' performance can also be influenced by position relative to the inside barrier (post position), gender, jockey, and training.\n\nJump (or jumps) racing in Great Britain and Ireland is known as National Hunt racing (although, confusingly, National Hunt racing also includes flat races taking place at jumps meetings; these are known as National Hunt flat races). Jump racing can be subdivided into steeplechasing and hurdling, according to the type and size of obstacles being jumped. The word \"steeplechasing\" can also refer collectively to any type of jump race in certain racing jurisdictions, particularly in the United States.\n\nTypically, horses progress to bigger obstacles and longer distances as they get older, so that a European jumps horse will tend to start in National Hunt flat races as a juvenile, move on to hurdling after a year or so, and then, if thought capable, move on to steeplechasing.\n\nThe length of an endurance race varies greatly. Some are very short, only ten miles, while others can be up to one hundred miles. There are a few races that are even longer than one hundred miles and last multiple days. These different lengths of races are divided into five categories: pleasure rides (10–20 miles), non-competitive trail rides (21–27 miles), competitive trail rides (20–45 miles), progressive trail rides (25–60 miles), and endurance rides (40–100 miles in one day, up to in multiple days). Because each race is very long, trails of natural terrain are generally used.\n\nContemporary organized endurance racing began in California around 1955, and the first race marked the beginning of the Tevis Cup This race was a one-hundred-mile, one-day-long ride starting in Squaw Valley, Placer County, and ending in Auburn. Founded in 1972, the American Endurance Ride Conference was the United States' first national endurance riding association. The longest endurance race in the world is the Mongol Derby, which is long.\n\nIn most horse races, entry is restricted to certain breeds; that is, the horse must have a sire (father) and a dam (mother) who are studbook-approved individuals of whatever breed is racing. For example, in a normal harness race, the horse's sire and dam must both be pure Standardbreds. The exception to this is in Quarter Horse racing, where an Appendix Quarter Horse may be considered eligible to race against (standard) Quarter Horses. The designation of \"Appendix\" refers to the addendum section, or Appendix, of the Official Quarter Horse registry. An Appendix Quarter Horse is a horse that has either one Quarter Horse parent and one parent of any other eligible breed (such as Thoroughbred, the most common Appendix cross), two parents that are registered Appendix Quarter Horses, or one parent that is a Quarter Horse and one parent that is an Appendix Quarter Horse. AQHA also issues a \"Racing Register of Merit,\" which allows a horse to race on Quarter Horse tracks, but not be considered a Quarter Horse for breeding purposes (unless other requirements are met).\n\nA stallion who has won many races may be put up to stud when he is retired. Artificial insemination and embryo transfer technology (allowed only in some breeds) has brought changes to the traditions and ease of breeding.\n\nPedigrees of stallions are recorded in various books and websites, such as \"Weatherbys Stallion Book\", the \"Australian Stud Book\" and \"Thoroughbred Heritage\".\n\nThere are three founding sires that all Thoroughbreds can trace back to in the male line: the Darley Arabian, the Godolphin Arabian, and the Byerly Turk, named after their respective owners Thomas Darley, Lord Godolphin, and Captain Robert Byerly. They were taken to England, where they were mated with mares from English and imported bloodlines. The resultant foals were the first generation of Thoroughbreds, and all modern Thoroughbreds trace back to them. Thoroughbreds range in height, which is measured in hands (a hand being four inches). Some are as small as 15 hands while others are over 17. Thoroughbreds can travel medium distances at fast paces, requiring a balance between speed and endurance. Thoroughbreds may be bay, black, dark bay/brown, chestnut, gray, roan, white or palomino. Artificial insemination, cloning and embryo transfer are not allowed in the Thoroughbred breed.\n\nThe Arabian horse was developed by the Bedouin people of the Middle East specifically for stamina over long distances, so they could outrun their enemies. It was not until 1725 that the Arabian was introduced into the United States. Arabians appeared in the United States in colonial times, though were not bred as purebreds until about the time of the Civil War. Until the formation of the Arabian Horse Registry of America in 1908, Arabians were recorded with the Jockey Club in a separate subsection from Thoroughbreds.\n\nArabians must be able to withstand traveling long distances at a moderate pace. They have an abundance of type I muscle fibers, enabling their muscles to work for extended periods of time. Also, the muscles of the Arabian are not nearly as massive as those of the Quarter Horse, which allow it to travel longer distances at quicker speeds. The Arabian is primarily used today in endurance racing, but is also raced over traditional race tracks in many countries.\n\nArabian Horse Racing is governed by the International Federation of Arabian Horse Racing.\n\nThe ancestors of the Quarter Horse were prevalent in America in the early 17th century. These horses were a blend of Colonial Spanish horses crossed with English horses that were brought over in the 1700s. The native horse and the English horse were bred together, resulting in a compact, muscular horse. At this time, they were mainly used for chores such as plowing and cattle work. The American Quarter Horse was not recognized as an official breed until the formation of the American Quarter Horse Association in 1940.\n\nIn order to be successful in racing, Quarter Horses need to be able to propel themselves forward at extremely fast sprinter speed. The Quarter Horse has much larger hind limb muscles than the Arabian, which make it less suitable for endurance racing. It also has more type II-b muscle fibers, which allow the Quarter Horse to accelerate rapidly.\n\nWhen Quarter Horse racing began, it was very expensive to lay a full mile of track so it was agreed that a straight track of four hundred meters, or one quarter of a mile, would be laid instead. It became the standard racing distance for Quarter Horses and inspired their name. With the exception of the longer, distance contests, Quarter Horse races are run flat out, with the horses running at top speed for the duration. There is less jockeying for position, as turns are rare, and many races end with several contestants grouped together at the wire. The track surface is similar to that of Thoroughbred racing and usually consists of dirt.\n\nIn addition to the three main racing breeds above and their crosses, horse racing may be conducted using various other breeds: Appaloosa, American Paint Horse, mules, Selle Français, AQPS and Korean Jeju.\n\nMuscles are bundles of contractile fibers that are attached to bones by tendons. These bundles have different types of fibers within them, and horses have adapted over the years to produce different amounts of these fibers. Type II-b fibers are fast twitch fibers. These fibers allow muscles to contract quickly, resulting in a great deal of power and speed. Type I fibers are slow-twitch fibers. They allow muscles to work for longer periods of time resulting in greater endurance. Type II-a fibers are intermediate, representing a balance between the fast-twitch fibers and the slow-twitch fibers. They allow the muscles to generate both speed and endurance. Type I muscle fibers are adapted for aerobic exercise and rely on the presence of oxygen. Type II muscles are needed for anaerobic exercise because they can function in the absence of oxygen. Thoroughbreds possess more type II-a muscle fibers than Quarter Horses or Arabians. This type of fiber allows them to propel themselves forward at great speeds and maintain it for an extended distance.\n\nThe conditioning program for the different horses varies depending on the race length. Genetics, training, age, and skeletal soundness are all factors that contribute to a horse's performance. The muscle structure and fiber type of horses depends on the breed; therefore, genetics must be considered when constructing a conditioning plan. A horse's fitness plan must be coordinated properly in order to prevent injury or lameness. If these are to occur, they may negatively affect a horse's willingness to learn. Sprinting exercises are appropriate for training two-year-old racehorses, but the number is limited by psychological factors as well as physical. A horse's skeletal system adapts to the exercise it receives. Because the skeletal system does not reach full maturity until the horse is at least four years of age, young racehorses often suffer injuries.\n\nIn the United States, Thoroughbred flat races are run on surfaces of either dirt, synthetic or turf. Other tracks offer Quarter Horse racing and Standardbred racing, on combinations of these three types of racing surfaces. Racing of other breeds, such as Arabian horse racing, is found on a limited basis. American Thoroughbred races are run at a wide variety of distances, most commonly from ; with this in mind, breeders of Thoroughbred race horses attempt to breed horses that excel at a particular distance (see dosage index).\n\nHorse racing in the United States and on the North American continent dates back to 1665, which saw the establishment of the Newmarket course in Salisbury, New York, a section of what is now known as the Hempstead Plains of Long Island, New York. This first racing meet in North America was supervised by New York's colonial governor, Richard Nicolls. The area is now occupied by the present Nassau County, New York, region of Greater Westbury and East Garden City. The South Westbury section is still known as Salisbury.\n\nThe first record of quarter mile length races dated back to 1674 in Henrico County, Virginia. Each race consisted of only two horses, and they raced down the village streets and lanes. The Quarter Horse received its name from the length of the race.\n\nThe American Stud Book was started in 1868, prompting the beginning of organized horse racing in the United States. There were 314 tracks operating in the United States by 1890; and in 1894, the American Jockey Club was formed.\n\nThe Pleasanton Fairgrounds Racetrack at the Alameda County Fairgrounds is the oldest remaining horse racing track in America, dating back to 1858, when it was founded by the sons of the Spaniard Don Agustin Bernal.\nBelmont Park is located at the western edge of the Hempstead Plains. Its mile-and-a-half main track is the largest dirt Thoroughbred race course in the world, and it has the sport's largest grandstand.\n\nOne of the latest major horse track opened in the United States was the Meadowlands Racetrack, opened in 1977 for Thoroughbred racing. It is the home of the Meadowlands Cup. Other more recently opened tracks include Remington Park, Oklahoma City, opened in 1988, and Lone Star Park in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex, opened in 1997; the latter track hosted the prestigious Breeders' Cup series of races in 2004.\n\nThoroughbred horse racing in the United States has its own Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. The Hall of Fame honors remarkable horses, jockeys, owners, and trainers.\n\nThe traditional high point of US horse racing is the Kentucky Derby, held on the first Saturday of May at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Together, the Derby; the Preakness Stakes, held two weeks later at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland; and the Belmont Stakes, held three weeks after the Preakness at Belmont Park on Long Island, form the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing for three-year-olds. They are all held early in the year, throughout May and the beginning of June. In recent years the Breeders' Cup races, run at the end of the year, have challenged the Triple Crown events as determiners of the three-year-old champion. The Breeders' Cup is normally held at a different track every year; however, the 2010 and 2011 editions were both held at Churchill Downs, and the 2012, 2013 and 2014 races were held at Santa Anita Park. Keeneland, in Lexington, Kentucky, hosted the 2015 Breeders' Cup.\n\nThe corresponding Standardbred event is the Breeders Crown. There are also a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers and a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters.\n\nFor Arabians, there is the Arabian Triple Crown, consisting of Drinkers of the Wind Derby in California, the Texas Six Shooter Stakes, and the Bob Magness Derby in Delaware.\n\nAmerican betting on horse racing is sanctioned and regulated by the state where the race is located. Simulcast betting exists across state lines with minimal oversight except the companies involved through legalized parimutuel gambling. A takeout, or \"take\", is removed from each betting pool and distributed according to state law, among the state, race track and horsemen. A variety of factors affect takeout, namely location and the type of wager that is placed. One form of parimutuel gaming is Instant Racing, in which players bet on video replays of races.\n\nAdvanced Deposit Wagering is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets. ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a cut of ADW revenues.\n\nThe most famous horse from Canada is generally considered to be Northern Dancer, who after winning the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Queen's Plate in 1964 went on to become the most successful Thoroughbred sire of the twentieth century; his two-minute-flat Derby was the fastest on record until Secretariat in 1973. The only challenger to his title of greatest Canadian horse would be his son Nijinsky II, who is the last horse to win the English Triple Crown. Woodbine Racetrack (1956) in Toronto is home of the Queen's Plate (1860), Canada's premier Thoroughbred stakes race, and the North America Cup (1984), Canada's premier Standardbred stakes race. It is the only race track in North America which stages Thoroughbred and Standardbred (harness) meetings on the same day. The Canadian International and Woodbine Mile (1981) are Canada's most important Grade I races worth C$1,000,000 each, and have been won by many renowned horses such as Secretariat and Wise Dan respectively. Other key races include Woodbine Oaks (1956), Prince of Wales Stakes (1929), Breeders' Stakes (1889) and Canadian Derby (1930).\n\nHorse racing in Belgium takes place at three venues - Hippodrome Wellington in Ostend (opened in 1883 in honour of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington), Hippodroom Waregem in Waregem in Flanders and Hippodrome de Wallonie in Mons, Wallonia.\n\nThere are 15 racecourses in the Czech Republic, most notably Pardubice Racecourse, where the country's most famous race, the Velka Pardubicka steeplechase, has been run since 1874. Since 1907 races have also held on a central racecourse in Prague, Velka Chuchle. However, the first official race was organized back in 1816 by Emperor Francis II near Kladruby nad Labem. The Czech horse racing season usually starts at the beginning of April and ends some time in November. Racing takes place mostly at weekends and there is usually one meeting on a Saturday and one on Sunday. Horse races, as well as Thoroughbred horse breeding, is organized by Jockey Club Czech Republic, founded in 1919.\n\nFrance has a major horse racing industry. It is home to the famous Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe held at Longchamp Racecourse, the richest race in Europe and the second richest turf race in the world after the Japan Cup, with a prize of 4 million Euros (approximately US$5.2 million). Other major races include the Grand Prix de Paris, the Prix du Jockey Club (the French Derby) and the Prix de Diane. Besides Longchamp, France's other premier flat racecourses include Chantilly and Deauville. There is also a smaller but nevertheless important jumps racing sector, with Auteil Racecourse being the most well known. The sport's governing body is France Galop.\n\nHorse racing in Great Britain is predominantly thoroughbred flat and jumps racing. It was in Great Britain in the 17th to 19th centuries that many of the sport's rules and regulations were established. Named after Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby, The Derby was first run in 1780. The race serves as the middle leg of the British Triple Crown, preceded by the 2000 Guineas and followed by the St Leger. The name \"Derby\" has since become synonymous with great races all over the world, and as such has been borrowed many times in races abroad.\n\nThe Grand National is the most prominent race in British culture, watched by many people who do not normally watch or bet on horse racing at other times of the year. Many of the sport's greatest jockeys, most notably Sir Gordon Richards, have been British. The sport is regulated by the British Horseracing Authority. The BHA's authority does not extend to Northern Ireland; racing in Ireland is governed on an All-Ireland basis.\n\nDespite having an ancient tradition with well-documented history, all racetracks in Greece have ceased operation due to the Greek government-debt crisis.\n\nHungary has a long-standing horse racing tradition. The first horse racing in Pest was noted June 6, 1827. Although racing in Hungary is neither as popular nor as prestigious as it is in Western Europe, the country is notable for producing some fine international racehorses. Foremost of these is Kincsem, foaled in 1874 and the most successful Thoroughbred race horse ever, having won 54 races in 54 starts. The country also produced Overdose, a horse who won his first 12 races, including group races in Germany and Italy, and finished fourth in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot.\n\nIreland has a rich history of horse racing; point to pointing originated there, and even today, jump racing is more popular than racing on the flat. As a result, every year Irish horse racing fans travel in huge numbers to the highlight event of the National Hunt calendar, the Cheltenham Festival, and in recent years Irish owned or bred horses have dominated the event. Ireland has a thriving Thoroughbred breeding industry, stimulated by favourable tax treatment. The world's largest Thoroughbred stud farm, Coolmore Stud, has its main site there (in addition to major operations in the U.S. and Australia).\n\nIn recent years, Irish bred and trained horses have enjoyed considerable success in major races worldwide. Various horses achieved victory in one or more of the British 2000 Guineas, The Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, considered the three most prestigious races in Europe. In the six runnings of the Epsom Derby between 2008 and 2013, Irish horses filled 20 of the first 30 placings, winning the race 5 times.\n\nHistorically, Italy has been one of the leading European horse racing nations, albeit some respects behind Great Britain, Ireland and France in size and prestige. The late Italian horse breeder Federico Tesio was particularly notable. In recent years, however, the sport in the country has suffered a major funding crisis, culminating in its expulsion from the European Pattern.\n\nIn Wassenaar in the Hague there is a grass course at Duindigt.\n\nHorse racing in Poland can be dated to 1777, when a horse owned by Polish noble Kazimierz Rzewuski beat the horse of the English chargé d'affaires, Sir Charles Whitworth, on the road from Wola to Ujazdów Castle. The first regular horse racing was organized in 1841 on Mokotów Fields in Warsaw by Towarzystwo Wyścigów Konnych i Wystawy Zwierząt Gospodarskich w Królestwie Polskim (in English, the Society of Horse Racing in Congress Poland). The main racetrack in Poland is Warsaw's Służewiec Racecourse. The industry was severely limited during the Communist era, when gambling, the major source of funding, was made illegal.\n\nHorse racing in Australia was founded during the early years of settlement and the industry has grown to be among the top three leading Thoroughbred racing nations of the world. The world-famous Melbourne Cup, the \"race that stops a nation\", has recently attracted many international entries. In country racing, records indicate that Goulburn commenced racing in 1834. Australia's first country racing club was established at Wallabadah in 1852 and the Wallabadah Cup is still held on New Year's Day (the current racecourse was built in 1898).\n\nIn Australia, the most famous racehorse was Phar Lap (bred in New Zealand), who raced from 1928 to 1932. Phar Lap carried to win the 1930 Melbourne Cup. Australian steeplechaser Crisp is remembered for his battle with Irish champion Red Rum in the 1973 Grand National. In 2003–2005 the mare Makybe Diva (bred in Great Britain) became the only racehorse to ever win the Melbourne Cup three times, let alone in consecutive years. In harness racing, Cane Smoke had 120 wins, including 34 in a single season, Paleface Adios became a household name during the 1970s, while Cardigan Bay, a pacing horse from New Zealand, enjoyed great success at the highest levels of American harness racing in the 1960s. More recently, Blacks A Fake has won four Inter Dominion Championships, making him the only horse to complete this feat in Australasia's premier harness race.\n\nCompetitive endurance riding commenced in Australia in 1966, when the Tom Quilty Gold Cup was first held in the Hawkesbury district, near Sydney, New South Wales. The Quilty Cup is considered the National endurance ride and there are now over 100 endurance events contested across Australia, ranging in distances from 80 km to 400 km. The world's longest endurance ride is the Shahzada 400 km Memorial Test which is conducted over five days travelling 80 kilometres a day at St Albans on the Hawkesbury River, New South Wales. In all endurance events there are rigorous vet checks, conducted before, during and after the competition, in which the horses' welfare is of the utmost concern.\n\nRacing is a long-established sport in New Zealand, stretching back to colonial times.\n\nHorse racing is a significant part of the New Zealand economy which in 2004 generated 1.3% of the GDP. The indirect impact of expenditures on racing was estimated to have generated more than $1.4 billion in economic activity in 2004 and created 18,300 full-time equivalent jobs. More than 40,000 people were involved in some capacity in the New Zealand racing industry in 2004. In 2004, more than one million people attended race meetings in New Zealand. There are 69 Thoroughbred and 51 harness clubs licensed in New Zealand. Racecourses are situated in 59 locations throughout New Zealand.\n\nThe bloodstock industry is important to New Zealand, with the export sale of horses – mainly to Australia and Asia – generating more than $120 million a year. During the 2008–09 racing season 19 New Zealand bred horses won 22 Group One races around the world.\n\nNotable racehorses from New Zealand include Cardigan Bay, Carbine, Nightmarch, Sunline, Desert Gold and Rising Fast. Phar Lap and Tulloch were both bred in New Zealand but did not race there. The most famous of these is probably Cardigan Bay. Stanley Dancer drove the New Zealand bred horse, Cardigan Bay to win $1 million in stakes in 1968, the first harness horse to surpass that milestone in American history.\n\nOn 25 June 1812, the Champ de Mars Racecourse was inaugurated by The Mauritius Turf Club which was founded earlier in the same year by Colonel Edward A. Draper. The Champ de Mars is situated on a prestigious avenue in Port Louis, the capital city and is the oldest racecourse in the southern hemisphere. The Mauritius Turf Club is the second oldest active turf club in the world.\n\nUndeniably, racing is one of the most popular sports in Mauritius now attracting regular crowds of 20,000 people or more to the only racecourse of the island.\n\nA high level of professionalism has been attained in the organisation of races over the last decades preserving the unique electrifying ambiance prevailing on race days at the Champ de Mars.\n\nMembers of the British Royal Family, such as Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Margaret or the Queen Mother have attended or patroned races at the Champ de Mars numerous times.\n\nChamp de Mars has four classic events a year such as: Duchess of York Cup, Barbé Cup, Maiden Cup and the Duke of York Cup.\n\nMost of the horses are imported from South Africa but some are also acquired from Australia, the United Kingdom and France.\n\nHorse racing is a popular sport in South Africa that can be traced back to 1797. The first recorded race club meeting took place five years later in 1802. The national horse racing body is known as the National Horseracing Authority and was founded in 1882. The premier event, which attracts 50,000 people to Durban, is the Durban July Handicap, which has been run since 1897 at Greyville Racecourse. It is the largest and most prestigious event on the continent, with betting running into the hundreds of millions of Rands. Several July winners have gone on to win major international races, such as Colorado King, London News, and Ipi Tombe. However, the other notable major races are the Summer Cup, held at Turffontein Racecourse in Johannesburg, and The Sun Met, which is held at Kenilworth race track in Cape Town.\n\nHorse racing in one form or another has been a part of Chinese culture for millennia. Horse racing was a popular pastime for the aristocracy at least by the Zhou Dynasty - 4th century B.C. General Tian Ji's strategem for a horse race remains perhaps the best known story about horse racing in that period. In the 18th and 19th centuries, horse racing and equestrian sports in China was dominated by Mongol influences.\n\nThoroughbred horse racing came to China with British settlements in the middle 1800s and most notably centered around the treaty ports, including the two major race courses in Shanghai, the Shanghai Racecourse and the International Recreation Grounds (in Kiang-wan), and the racecourses of Tianjin. The Kiang-wan racecourse was destroyed in the lead-up to the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Shanghai Race Club closed in 1954. The former Shanghai Racecourse is now People's Square and People's Park and the former club building was the Shanghai Art Museum.\n\nAs Hong Kong and Macau are Special Administrative Region, they're allowed to exemption from ban of gambling on mainland China. (See below)\n\nHorse racing was banned in the Republic of China from 1945, and the People's Republic of China maintained the ban after 1949, although allowances were made for ethnic minority peoples for whom horse sports are a cultural tradition. Speed horse racing (速度赛马) was an event in the National Games of China, mainly introduced to cater for minority peoples, such as the Mongols. The race course was initially 5 km, but from 2005 (the 10th National Games) was extended to 12 km. The longer race led to deaths and injuries to participating horses in both 2005 and the 11th National Games in 2009. Also, with the entry into the sport of Han majority provinces such as Hubei, which are better funded and used Western, rather than traditional, breeding and training techniques, meant that the original purpose of the event to foster traditional horse racing for groups like the Mongols was at risk of being usurped. At the 2009 National Games, Hubei won both the gold and silver medals, with Inner Mongolia winning bronze. As a result of these factors, the event was abolished for the 12th National Games in 2013.\n\nClub horse racing reappeared on a small scale in the 1990s. In 2008, the China Speed Horse Race Open in Wuhan was organized as the qualification round for the speed horse race event at the National Games the next year, but was also seen by commentators as a step towards legalizing both horse racing and gambling on the races. The Wuhan Racecourse was the only racecourse that organized races in China. In 2014, the Wuhan Jockey Club organized more than 80 races. Almost all Chinese trainers and jockeys stabled in Wuhan. However, with the demise of the event at the National Games and the government not relenting from the ban on commercial racing, various racecourses built in recent years are all in a state of disuse: The Nanjing Racecourse, which previously hosted National Games equestrian events, is now used as a car park; the Beijing Jockey Club was shut down in 2008. The racecourse in Inner Mongolia has not been active after 2012.\n\nHorse racing eventually returned to mainland China on year 2014 as one-day, five-card event for foreign horses, trainers and jockeys.\n\nThe British tradition of horse racing left its mark with the creation of one of the most important entertainment and gambling institutions in Hong Kong. Established as the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club in 1884, the non-profit organisation conducts nearly 700 races every season at the two race tracks in Happy Valley and Sha Tin.\n\nAll horses are imported since there is no breeding operation.\nThe sport annually draws millions of dollars of tax revenue. Off-track betting is available from overseas bookmakers.\n\nJockey Club of Macau was established for harness racing. It started to conduct horse races in 1989.\n\nHorse racing in India is over 200 years old, making India quite possibly the oldest racing jurisdiction in Asia where racing was conducted under rules. India's first racecourse was set up in Madras in 1777. Today India has a very well established racing and breeding industry, and the sport is conducted on nine racetracks by seven racing authorities.\n\nJapan has two governing bodies that control its horseracing - the Japan Racing Association (JRA), and National Association of Racing (NAR). Between them they conduct more than 21,000 horse races a year. The JRA is responsible for 'Chuo Keiba' (meaning 'central horse racing'), taking place on the ten main Japanese tracks. The NAR, meanwhile, is responsible for 'Chihou Keiba' (meaning 'local horse racing'). Racing in Japan is mainly flat racing, but Japan also has jump racing and a sled-pulling race known as Ban'ei (also called Draft Racing).\n\nJapan's top stakes races are run in the spring, autumn, and winter. These include the country's most prominent race - the Grade 1 Japan Cup, a 2,400 m (about 1½ mile) invitational turf race run every November at Tokyo Racecourse for a purse of ¥476 million (about US$5.6 million), currently the richest turf race in the world. Other noted stakes races include the February Stakes, Takamatsunomiya Kinen, Yasuda Kinen, Takarazuka Kinen, Arima Kinen, and the Tenno Sho races run in the spring and fall. Japan's top jump race is the Nakayama Grand Jump, run every April at Nakayama Racecourse.\n\nIn Malaysia, horse racing was introduced during the British colonial era and remains to the present day as a gambling activity. There are three race courses in Malaysia, namely Penang Turf Club, Perak Turf Club and Selangor Turf Club. Within and only within the turf clubs, betting on horse racing is a legal form of gambling. Racing in Malaysia and Singapore is conducted and governed under the Rules of the Malayan Racing Association and betting in Malaysia is operated and organized by Pan Malaysian Pools Sdn Bhd.\n\nMongolian horse racing takes place during the Naadam festival. Mongolia does not have Thoroughbred horse racing. Rather, it has its own Mongolian style of horse racing in which the horses run for at least a distance of 25 kilometers.\n\nHorse races are held in Pakistan at four different clubs. In Lahore at Lahore Race Club, Rawalpindi at Chakri, in Karachi at Karachi Race Club and in Gujrat at Gujrat Race Club.\n\nHorseracing in the Philippines began in 1867. The history of Philippine horseracing has three divisions according to the breeds of horses used. They are the Philippine-pony era (1867-1898), the Arabian-horse era (1898-1930), and the Thoroughbred-era (1935–present).\n\nHorse racing was introduced to Singapore by the British during the colonial era and remained one of the legal forms of gambling after independence. It remains a highly popular form of entertainment with the local Singaporean community to this day. Races are typically held on Friday evenings and Sundays at the Singapore Turf Club in Kranji. Horse racing has also left its mark in the naming of roads in Singapore such as Race Course Road in Little India, where horse racing was first held in Singapore, and Turf Club Road in Bukit Timah where Singapore Turf Club used to be situated before moving to its current location in 1999.\n\nHorse racing in South Korea dates back to May 1898, when a foreign language institute run by the government included a donkey race in its athletic rally. However, it wasn't until the 1920s that modern horse racing involving betting developed. The nation's first authorised club, the Chosun Racing Club, was established in 1922 and a year later, the pari-mutuel betting system was officially adopted for the first time.\n\nThe Korean War disrupted the development of horse racing in the country, but after the Seoul Olympics in 1988, the Olympic Equestrian Park was converted into racing facilities named Seoul Race Park, which helped the sport to develop again.\n\nThe big race in the UAE is the Dubai World Cup, a race with a purse of US$10 million, which was the largest purse in the world until being surpassed by the Pegasus World Cup, an American race with a $12 million purse that held its first edition in 2017. Other races include the Dubai Kahayla Classic with a purse of US$250,000.\n\nThe Meydan Racecourse in Dubai, reported to be the world's largest race track, opened on March 27, 2010 for the Dubai World Cup race. The race track complex contains two tracks with seating for 60,000, a hotel, restaurants, theater and museum.\n\nThere is no parimutuel betting in the UAE as gambling is illegal.\n\nIn Argentina the sport is known as turf. Some of the most famous racers are Irineo Leguisamo, Vilmar Sanguinetti, Marina Lezcano, Jorge Valdivieso, Pablo Falero and Jorge Ricardo.\nThe Carlos Gardel's tango Por una cabeza is about horse racing, sport of which he was a known fan. Gardel was a good friend of Irineo Leguisamo, who is the most recognized Argentine jockey.\n\nAt many horse races, there is a gambling station, where gamblers can stake money on a horse. Gambling on horses is prohibited at some tracks; Springdale Race Course, home of the nationally renowned Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank) Carolina Cup and Colonial Cup Steeplechase in Camden, South Carolina, is known as one of the tracks where betting is illegal, due to a 1951 law. Where gambling is allowed, most tracks offer parimutuel betting where gamblers' money is pooled and shared proportionally among the winners once a deduction is made from the pool. In some countries, such as the UK, Ireland, and Australia, an alternative and more popular facility is provided by bookmakers who effectively make a market in odds. This allows the gambler to 'lock in' odds on a horse at a particular time (known as 'taking the price' in the UK). Parimutuel gambling on races also provides not only purse money to participants but considerable tax revenue, with over $100 billion wagered annually in 53 countries.\n\nOrganized groups dedicated to protecting animals, such as the Humane Society of the United States and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, target some horse sports with claims of animal cruelty. Horse racing and rodeo are most commonly targeted, due both to their high visibility and to the level of stress and potential physical dangers to the equines involved. Criticism of horse racing and its practices runs a wide gamut; however, while some may consider even fairly drastic discipline of horses non-abusive, others may consider abuse to be anything done against the will of the animal in question. Some people may consider poor living conditions or use of whip abusive, while some may have concern with end-use of horses.\n\nIn 2009, animal rights group PETA released undercover video of alleged abuses of former race horses at a slaughterhouse in Kumamoto, Japan. The group stated that \"as many as 20,000\" horses, including former Thoroughbred race horses, were killed in 2008 in Japan for use as human and pet food (the official figure for 2008 was 15,003 horses). Based on findings of 2009 and fate of 1986 Kentucky Derby Winner Ferdinand, PETA has called ban for exporting race horses to Japan, even though the amount of young horses exported to Japan for racing purposes is insignificant compared to the overall amount and only adult horses exported to Japan are breeding stock.\n\nThere are many dangers in horse racing for both horse and jockey: a horse can stumble and fall, or fall when jumping an obstacle, exposing both jockey and horse to the danger of being trampled and injured.\n\nAnna Waller, a member of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of North Carolina, co-authored a four-year-long study of jockey injuries and stated to the New York Times that \"For every 1,000 jockeys you have riding [for one year], over 600 will have medically treated injuries.\" She added that almost 20% of these were serious head or neck injuries. The study reported 6,545 injuries during the years 1993–1996. More than 100 jockeys were killed in the US between 1950 and 1987.\n\nHorses also face dangers in racing. 1.5 horses die out of every 1000 starts in the US. The U.S. Jockey Club in New York estimates that about 600 horses died at racetracks in 2006. The Jockey Club in Hong Kong reported a far lower figure of .58 horses per 1000 starts. There is speculation that drugs used in horse racing in the US which are banned elsewhere are responsible for the higher death rate in the US.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "307442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307442", "title": "Marylebone Cricket Club", "text": "Marylebone Cricket Club\n\nMarylebone Cricket Club (MCC) is a cricket club founded in 1787 and based since 1814 at Lord's cricket ground, which it owns, in St John's Wood, London, England.\n\nThe club's own teams are essentially \"ad hoc\" because they have never taken part in any formal competition. MCC teams have always held first-class status depending on the quality of the opposition. To mark the beginning of each English season, MCC plays the reigning County Champions.\n\nIn 1788, the MCC took responsibility for the Laws of Cricket, issuing a revised version that year. Although changes to the Laws are now determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the copyright is still owned by MCC. The club was formerly the governing body of cricket in England and Wales and, as the sport's legislator, held considerable global influence.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, commencing with the 1903–04 tour of Australia and ending with the 1976–77 tour of India, MCC organised international tours in which the England cricket team played Test matches. On these tours, the England team was called MCC in non-international matches. In 1993, its administrative and governance functions were transferred to the ICC and the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB).\n\nThe origin of MCC was as a gentlemen's club that had flourished through most of the 18th century, including, at least in part, an existence as the original London Cricket Club, which had played at the Artillery Ground through the middle years of the century. Many of its members became involved with the Hambledon Club through the 1770s and then, in the early 1780s, had returned to the London area where the White Conduit Club had begun in Islington. It is not known for certain when the White Conduit was founded but it seems to have been after 1780 and certainly by 1785. According to Pelham Warner, it was formed in 1782 as an offshoot from a West End convivial club called the \"Je-ne-sais-quoi\", some of whose members frequented the White Conduit House in Islington and played matches on the neighbouring White Conduit Fields, which had been a prominent venue for cricket in the 1720s. Arthur Haygarth said in \"Scores and Biographies\" that \"the Marylebone Club was founded in 1787 from the White Conduit's members\" but the date of the formation of the White Conduit \"could not be found\".\n\nThis gentlemen's club, which was multi-purpose, had a social meeting place at the \"Star and Garter\" on Pall Mall. It was the same club that was responsible for drafting the Laws of Cricket at various times, most notably in 1744 and 1774, and this lawgiving responsibility was soon to be vested in the MCC as the final repose of these cricketing gentlemen. When the White Conduit began, its leading lights were George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea (1752–1826) and the Hon. Colonel Charles Lennox (1764–1819), who later became the 4th Duke of Richmond. White Conduit was nominally an exclusive club that only \"gentlemen\" might play for, but the club did employ professionals and one of these was the bowler Thomas Lord, a man who was recognised for his business acumen (he became a successful wine and provisions merchant) as well as his bowling ability.\n\nThe new club might have continued except that White Conduit Fields was an open area allowing members of the public, including the rowdier elements, to watch the matches and to voice their opinions on the play and the players. The White Conduit gentlemen were not amused by such interruptions and decided to look for a more private venue of their own. Winchilsea and Lennox asked Lord to find a new ground and offered him a guarantee against any losses he may suffer in the venture. Lord took a lease from the Portman Estate on some land at Dorset Fields where Dorset Square is now sited; and the ground was prepared and opened in 1787. It was initially called the New Cricket Ground, perhaps because it was off what was then called \"the New Road\" in Marylebone, when the first known match was played there on 21 May but, by the end of July, it was known as Lord's. As it was in Marylebone, the White Conduit members who relocated to it soon decided to call themselves the \"Mary-le-bone Club\". The exact date of MCC's foundation is lost but seems to have been sometime in the late spring or the summer of 1787. On 10 & 11 July 1837, a South v North match was staged at Lord's to commemorate the MCC's Golden Jubilee. Warner described it as \"a Grand Match to celebrate the Jubilee of the Club\" and reproduced the full scorecard.\n\nOn Wednesday, 25 April 1787, the London \"Morning Herald\" newspaper carried a notice: \"The Members of the Cricket Club are desired to meet at the \"Star and Garter\", Pall Mall, on Mon., April 30. Dinner on table exactly at half past five o'clock. N.B. The favour of an answer is desired\". The agenda is unknown but, only three weeks later on Saturday, 19 May, the \"Morning Herald\" advertised: \"A grand match will be played on Monday, 21 May in the New Cricket Ground, the New Road, Mary-le-bone, between eleven Noblemen of the White Conduit Club and eleven Gentlemen of the County of Middlesex with two men given, for 500 guineas a side. The wickets to be pitched at ten o'clock, and the match to be played out\". No post-match report has been found but, as G. B. Buckley said, it was \"apparently the first match to be played on Lord's new ground\".\n\nA total of eight matches are known to have been played at Lord's in 1787, one of them a single wicket event. The only one which featured the Mary-le-bone Club took place on Monday, 30 July. It was advertised in \"The World\" on Friday, 27 July 1787: \"On Monday, 30 July will be played (at Lord's) a match between 11 gentlemen of the Mary-le-bone Club and 11 gentlemen of the Islington Club\". Buckley stated that \"this is the earliest notice of the Marylebone Club\". As with the inaugural match at Lord's, no post-match report of the inaugural MCC match has been found.\n\nThere have been three Lord's grounds: the original on the Portman Estate and two on the Eyre Estate. All three sites lie to the west of Regent's Park. Thomas Lord leased the original ground, now referred to as Lord's Old Ground, from the Portman Estate in 1787 and MCC played there until 1810 when Lord, after objecting to a rent increase, decided on termination of the lease to lift his turf and move out. Over 200 matches are known to have been played there, mostly involving MCC and/or Middlesex. The Old Ground was on the site now occupied by Dorset Square which is east of Marylebone Station and west of Baker Street. To commemorate the association, a plaque was unveiled in Dorset Square on 9 May 2006 by Andrew Strauss.\n\nLord had been aware some years before 1810 that the Portman Estate intended to let the site on building leases which would command the much higher rent of over £600 per annum. On 15 October 1808, he rented two fields in the North Bank area of the St John's Wood Estate, which belonged to Richard Eyre, a local landowner after whom Eyre's Tunnel on the Regent's Canal was named. Rental on the Eyre site was only £54 per annum for a term of eighty years and free of both land tax and tithe.\n\nThe new ground was ready for use in 1809 and so Lord had two grounds at his disposal for the 1809 and 1810 seasons. The North Bank ground was sub-let to St John's Wood Cricket Club, which eventually merged with MCC. Lord officially took over his second ground on 8 May 1811 by literally re-laying there his turf from the Old Ground. He did this so that \"the noblemen and gentlemen of the MCC should be able to play on the same footing as before\". According to Warner, however, the relocation was unpopular with many MCC members and, as a result, the club played no matches there in either 1811 or 1812. This may have been so but cricket generally was in decline at the time because of the Napoleonic Wars. The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (the ACS) holds that \"(from) 1810 to 1814 the game was all but dead\", largely because of the war and \"the very real threat of civil unrest in England\". The second venue is now generally known as Lord's Middle Ground. In the three years that Lord controlled it, only six matches are known to have taken place there and just three of these (all in 1813) involved MCC. The Middle Ground's exact location is uncertain but it is understood to have been in North Bank at the north end of Lisson Grove and that the Regent's Canal has been cut through it. This means that it was partially on the canal route and somewhere in the area now bounded by Lisson Grove (the B507) to south-west, Lodge Road to north-west, Park Road (the A41) to north-east and the Regent's Canal to south-east. It was less than 300 metres from the site of the modern Lord's ground.\n\nLord was forced to abandon the Middle Ground because of the canal construction. The decision on the route was made by Parliament in 1813. Lord approached the Eyre family who were willing to lease him another plot nearby in St John's Wood, but at an increased rent of £100 per annum. Lord accepted and again removed and relaid his turf in time for the start of the 1814 season. This third ground was the present Lord's, now home to MCC for over 200 years.\n\nMCC is the custodian of, and remains the copyright holder of, the \"Laws of Cricket\". Its Laws sub-committee is responsible for debating and drafting changes to the Laws, with the Main Committee then voting on any changes proposed.\n\nMCC has 18,000 full members and 5,000 associate members. Members have voting rights and can use the Pavilion and other stands at Lord's to attend all matches played at the ground.\n\nIn order to join the waiting list of candidates for membership one must obtain the vote (of which each full member has one a year) of three members, and the additional sponsorship of a person on the List of MCC Sponsors (which consists of members of all MCC Sub-Committees; MCC Committee; MCC Out-Match Representatives; and the Current, Past, and Designate President). As the demand for membership always outstrips supply each year, there continues to be a substantial waiting list for Full Ordinary Membership, currently around 27 years. There are, however, ways to lessen the time it takes to become a full member: one may qualify as a Playing Member, or Out-Match Member (although this carries none of the privileges of membership, apart from being able to play for the club). In addition, membership rules allow a certain number of people each year to be elected ahead of their turn; beneficiaries have included Sir Mick Jagger and, notably, in 2018 prime minister Theresa May. MCC also grants limited honorary membership to people who have had distinguished cricket careers. The club was a male-only bastion until the 1990s but it now recognises achievement in women's cricket with, for example, Charlotte Edwards an inductee in the 2010s.\n\nThe club's members persistently refused to allow female membership well into the 1990s, with club ballots on the change unable to attract the two-thirds majority amongst the membership required for implementation. The move to change was spearheaded by Rachael Heyhoe Flint who applied as \"R Flint\" to slip into the male-only application system. A 70% majority of members eventually voted to allow female membership in September 1998, so ending 212 years of male exclusivity, and 10 honorary life members were immediately admitted, including Heyhoe Flint. Up until this time, the Queen, who is the club's patron, was the only woman (other than domestic staff) permitted to enter the Pavilion during play. In February 1999, five women were invited to join as playing members.\n\nFurther controversy occurred in 2005 when the club was criticised (including by a few of its own members) for siding with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) over the latter's decision to award television rights for Test cricket to British Sky Broadcasting, thus removing Test cricket from terrestrial television. The Secretary and Chief Executive of MCC at the time, Roger Knight, represented the club on the board of the ECB and was party to this controversial and much criticised decision, prior to which Test cricket had been shown free to viewers on British television for more than half a century.\n\nAnother controversy was MCC's decision to allow members and other spectators to continue to bring limited amounts of alcoholic drinks into the ground at all matches. This decision challenged the ICC, which was attempting to implement a ban on this practice at all international matches around the world. MCC has opted to write to the ICC on an annual basis to seek permission for members and spectators to import alcohol into Lord's. No other Ground Authority has thought it necessary to seek permission from the ICC for their members and spectators to import alcohol into their cricket ground, there being money to be made out of selling alcohol themselves.\n\nGiven its heritage, MCC continues to participate in the administration of English cricket, and in 2010 offered Lord's as a neutral venue for Pakistan to stage a \"home\" Test match, as scheduled by the ICC, versus Australia; the club's initial offering was made with the intention that Pakistan, whose terrorist-stricken country had rendered it a no-go area for international cricket, could remain within the international cricketing fold.\n\nThe Secretary & Chief Executive of the club has a place on the administrative board of the England and Wales Cricket Board and it is reported that Keith Bradshaw (the outgoing Secretary & Chief Executive) may have been influential in the removal from office of England Coach Duncan Fletcher in April 2007.\n\nIn 2012, MCC made headlines over a controversial redevelopment plan, \"Vision for Lord's\", that would have increased capacity but included construction of residential flats on some of the MCC site. Internal strife over the process of making a decision on the proposal led to the resignation of former prime minister John Major from the main committee.\n\nMCC has long had a deep involvement in coaching the game of cricket. The club's head coach leads an extensive operation involving the running of an indoor-cricket school and a team of coaches in England and around the world. The club has traditionally produced a coaching manual, the \"MCC Cricket Coaching Book\", a bible for cricket skills, and runs training programmes for young cricketers, including many at its Lord's Indoor Centre. MCC continues to tour around England, playing matches against various state and private schools. This tradition has been followed since the 19th century. The club has other sporting interests with both a real tennis and a squash court on site at Lord's, and golf, chess, bridge and backgammon societies.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 20th century, MCC organised the England cricket team and, outside Test matches, the touring England team officially played as \"MCC\" up to and including the 1976/77 tour of India. The England touring team wore the distinctive red and yellow stripes of the Marylebone Cricket Club as their colours for the last time on the tour to New Zealand in 1996/97.\n\nThe true provenance of MCC's colours is (and probably will remain) unknown, but its players often turned out sporting sky blue until well into the 19th century. The club eventually settled on the now well-recognised colours of scarlet and gold. One theory is that MCC adopted these colours from J&W Nicholson & Co's gin after the company's chairman, MCC benefactor William Nicholson (1825–1909), secured the club's position at Lord's with a loan. Another theory, which chimes with the club's origins, is that MCC borrowed its colours from the livery colours (racing) of a founding patron, Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond, of Goodwood fame.\n\nOften viewed as overly staid and pontifical (i.e. \"Establishment\"), the club has of late improved its image in the eyes of the public and media, partly because it remains a citadel for tradition in a fast-changing landscape and partly because it has made a concerted move towards image-improvement. \"It would be overstating things to claim that the MCC has come full circle,\" admitted Andrew Miller at the beginning of October 2008, \"but at a time of massive upheaval in the world game, the... colours of NW8 have ceased to represent everything that is wrong with cricket, and instead have become a touchstone for those whose greatest fear is the erosion of the game's traditional values.\"\n\nUntil 2013 the MCC was a private members club (and this meant that it had the status of an unincorporated association). This status had several limitations. Since an unincorporated association is not a legal entity, it could not own property (such as Lord's Cricket Ground itself) in its own name. It could not sue anybody, or indeed be sued (any legal action had to be taken against the Secretary & Chief Executive personally). In the event that a claim was successful, the committee and even the members themselves would have had to fund any financial shortfall. The club therefore called a Special General Meeting in June 2012 to consider petitioning the Queen in Council to incorporate the club by Royal Charter. The charter would remove many of the barriers and simplify the administration of the club.\n\nResulting from the petition, in December 2012 the club was granted a Royal charter, two previous attempts having been unsuccessful. As a result, the club became an incorporated association and is now able to hold assets, including the Lord's ground, in its own name instead of via a custodian trustee. It also meant that the individual members, as the club's owners, no longer have a potential liability should the club ever get into serious financial trouble.\n\nSince 2005 the MCC has funded six university cricket academies known as the MCC Universities (MCCUs). (Prior to 2010 they were known as the University Centres of Cricketing Excellence (UCCEs).) They are based at Cambridge, Cardiff, Durham, Leeds/Bradford, Loughborough and Oxford, and incorporate a total of thirteen educational establishments. , all six MCCUs have been granted first-class status by the ECB. Each MCCU plays a trio of matches against professional county sides at the beginning of each season, with first-class status conferred on the first two of these matches.\n\nPresidents serve a twelve-month term and cannot normally serve two terms in succession. Notable exceptions occurred during World War I and World War II. In 1914, Lord Hawke was appointed President and was asked to remain in the post till the end of the war. As a result, Hawke was MCC President for five years from 1914 to 1918 inclusive and was succeeded in 1919 by the former Hampshire slow left-arm bowler Henry Forster, who shortly afterwards succeeded to the title of Lord Forster of Lepe. Throughout the war, Lord's was used for military purposes, including training and recreation. Problems frequently arose but, in \"Wisden's\" view, Hawke was \"the greatest help in giving wise counsel towards their solution\". Hawke's tenure was exceeded by that of Stanley Christopherson who was appointed in 1939 and remained \"in situ\" for seven years until 1945 before he was succeeded by General Ronald Adam. In his \"Barclays World of Cricket\" essay about the MCC Presidency, E. W. Swanton said that \"there is no pretence of democracy about it\" and commented on how few were untitled up to the Second World War. As he said, membership of the aristocracy was a more important factor than any cricketing prowess. In the 21st century there have been MCC Presidents who as players were wholly professional: Tom Graveney, Derek Underwood, Mike Gatting and Matthew Fleming.\n\nEach President is required to nominate his successor at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) which takes place during his term of office. The club chairman and the treasurer serve a three-year term. Both are appointed by the committee (but subject to approval of the voting members). Both can serve terms in succession. The secretary and chief executive (a joint role) is the senior employee of the club and is appointed solely by the MCC committee.\n\nThe committee consists of the above officers plus the chairmen of any other committees that may exist at the time of any meeting plus twelve elected members. Elected committee members are appointed for a three-year term. An elected committee member cannot be re-elected upon retirement unless there is a gap of at least one year between terms of office.\n\n\n\n"}

The water temperature ranges from 15 to 20 °C (59 to 68 °F). \nAlthough the waves in central Chile are bigger, the waves in the north are stronger and are usually better suited for surfing.\nThe cold waters of central and southern Chile can be brutal to surf, therefore, surfers adventuring into those areas are strongly advised on using a protective wetsuit to protect against the elements.\n\nSome of the most popular surfing spots in Chile are:\n\nLocated south west of Santiago, Pichilemu is the number one spot for surfing in Chile. The town is the host of the annual national championships. This location offers something for every kind of surfer. Beginners usually try to catch their first waves at the beaches of \"Las Terrazas\" or \"La Puntilla\". While more skilled usually hang out at Infiernillo, and only the most experienced surfers adventure into Punta de Lobos where the waves can get up to 6 meters high.\n\nJust north of Viña del Mar, Ritoque is one of Chile’s most beautiful places for surfing. On the 13 kilometer long Ritoque beach waves can get as high as 7 meters.\n\nClose by the city of Arica is the \"Playa Gringo\", whereas the name tells many US Americans go to surf.
