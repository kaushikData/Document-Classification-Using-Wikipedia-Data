The phrase is most common in association football, where it is sometimes applied only to the scoreline at half-time. It is sometimes also encountered in other sports where 2-0 is a moderately large lead, such as ice hockey.\n\nThe underlying concept is that, a team which is leading 2-0 will be complacent and have a 'false sense of security' in their lead. If the trailing team then scores to make it 2-1, the leading team can panic and concede further, resulting in a draw, or even a win for the other team. In contrast, a team which is leading 1-0 will tend to concentrate and play with intensity to protect or extend their narrow lead, whilst teams leading by three or more goals have a sufficiently large buffer that comebacks are unlikely.\n\nThe cliché may be invoked by coaches to encourage their players to maintain effort levels after obtaining a two-goal lead. It can also be used in broadcasting, such as by a commentator or studio pundit, to suggest that the final result is still in doubt, thereby maintaining audience interest in a game.\n\nThere is little evidence that 2-0 is the worst lead in practice. In football, a team leading 2-0 at half-time only goes on to lose the game in about 2% of cases. In ice hockey, statistics show that if a team builds a two-goal advantage, they go on to win the game in the majority of instances, and that a one-goal lead is far more dangerous. As a result, the cliché is often used in full knowledge that 2-0 is not in fact the worst possible lead.\n\nThe cliché was popularized by Czech football coach and television commentator Josef Csaplár in the Czech football community. His use of the term suggested that a 2–0 half-time lead could only end in a defeat and the cliché is known in the Czech Republic as \"Csaplár's trap\" (Czech: \"Csaplárova past\").\n\nIn Serbia, the cliché is known for being used by manager and former player Milan Živadinović.\n\nThe cliché was also used by Australian former player and TV broadcaster Johnny Warren. Television pundit and former English footballer Gary Lineker raised the cliché when commenting on a 2016 match between Bournemouth and Liverpool, in which Liverpool led by 2–0 at half-time but ended up losing 4–3.\n"}

It serves as the home ground of the Gold Coast Suns, who compete in the Australian Football League, while also regularly hosting Big Bash League matches. Carrara Stadium received substantial redevelopment work prior to the entry of the Brisbane Bears to the VFL/AFL in 1987, but following the Bears relocation to the Brisbane Cricket Ground in 1993, it was used for other sports including rugby league, rugby union and even baseball. The stadium has hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games as well as the athletics competitions.\n\nIn 1983 the Nerang Bulls Rugby Union Club was formed and were located at Carrara Oval. During 1983 the Bulls would field one senior team. In 1984 the Bulls would field two senior teams. The Bulls would spend two seasons at Carrara before moving to Glennon Park in Nerang in 1985.\n\nOn 7 October 1986 it was announced that Australian rules football club the Brisbane Bears were granted a licence to enter the Victorian Football League for the 1987 VFL season. Bears President Paul Cronin announced on 23 December 1986 that the club would use Carrara Oval as their home ground. The financial backer of the Bears, Christopher Skase, spent $1 million redeveloping Carrara Oval over a 10-week period at the beginning of 1987 which included upgraded player facilities, seating for 6000 spectators and new electronic scoreboard. The Fitzroy Lions defeated the Brisbane Bears in the first VFL game played at Carrara Oval before a crowd of 17,795 on 19 April 1987. (The Brisbane Lions website records this crowd as unofficially 22,684).\n\nIn 1989 the Brisbane Bears and the Albert Shire Council signed off on a 30-year lease for the ground with an option for a further 10 years. Following this announcement Christpher Skase orchestrated the installment of $6 million flood lights which were never paid for; upon the collapse of Skase's company Qintex, he would flee the country to Spain and the flood lights would continue to be unpaid. Liquidators would attempt to extract money from the Gold Coast City Council for the lights, but after an unsuccessful trial it was found cheaper to leave the flood lights at Carrara Stadium. On 15 July 1989 the Bears hosted the first ever night match at Carrara against the Geelong Cats in front of a then record crowd of 18,198.\n\nInsufficient public transport to and from the stadium and the poor on-field performance of the Bears resulted in poor crowds at the Bears games and prompted the local media to refer to it as the Curse of Carrara. The new owner of the Bears, Reuben Pelerman, would lose a further $10 million between the 1990–1992 AFL seasons, and the Bears would move permanently to the Brisbane Cricket Ground in 1993, staving off media rumours of a merger with fellow cellar-dwellers Sydney to form a combined Queensland/New South Wales team, the Northern Swans, or relocation to either Tasmania or Port Adelaide.\n\nIn 1988, Carrara Stadium played host to the very first Touch Football World Cup in which teams from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the USA competed in the Men's, Women's and Mixed Opens as well as Men's Over 35's divisions. Australia won all four division finals which were all played against New Zealand. The Gold Coast Clippers played their 1989–1990 Australian Baseball League (1989-1999) season at Carrara before changing their name to the Daikyo Dolphins and moving to Palm Meadows. For the 1992–93 season they moved back to Carrara as the Gold Coast Cougars. The Cougars stayed at Carrara until the abolition of the Australian Baseball League in 1999. The Brazilian football team set up camp at Carrara Stadium for pre-tournament training before the 2000 Summer Olympics. The Brazilians later commented that the surface at Carrara was one of the best in the world.\nThe ground was owned by the Albert Shire Council and transferred to the Gold Coast City Council when the two local authorities amalgamated in 1995. The field is officially known as Laver Oval after long time Albert Shire Chairman Councillor Bill Laver.\n\nFollowing the folding of the Gold Coast Seagulls in 1995 a newly formed Gold Coast rugby league team named the Gold Coast Chargers were created and began competing out of Carrara Stadium in 1996. They continued to use the ground until the end of the 1998 NRL season when they were excluded from the competition as a part of the rationalisation of the National Rugby League. Rugby league matches continued to be played at the stadium, with pre-season trials being played there annually from 2002 to 2005, and NRL premiership matches played in 2001 and 2005. The ground's capacity was increased slightly during this time.\n\nIn 2005 the NRL announced that a licence would be awarded to the Gold Coast Titans, and that the stadium would be their home ground in 2007 until the completion of the Robina Stadium, which was opened in 2008. In response to the NRL move, the AFL scheduled three AFL 'home games' for the North Melbourne Football Club and a NAB Cup match for Carrara in 2007, and the Queensland State League began hosting grand finals there. The Titans would play ten games at Carrara in 2007 and miss the finals. Following the conclusion of the 2007 NRL season, Titans managing director Michael Searle warned the AFL that if a team were to be started on the Gold Coast it would disappear into the Carrara 'black hole' within five years.\n\nIn 2006 it was announced the North Melbourne Football Club would play nine home games at Carrara between the 2007–2009 seasons. Following the 2007 AFL season the AFL offered the Kangaroos a $100 million package to relocate from Melbourne to the Gold Coast and be based out of Carrara. On 7 December 2007 the newly appointed Kangaroos chairman James Brayshaw announced the club would not be moving to the Gold Coast permanently and would continue to be based out of Melbourne. Subsequently, the Kangaroos games played at Carrara after the announcement suffered poor crowds. The AFL released North Melbourne from the final year of a three-year contract after they drew just 6,354 spectators to their first home match at Carrara for the 2008 season.\n\nCarlton, Richmond and St Kilda subsequently hosted the remaining home games during the 2009 season.\n\nOn 7 May 2009, it was confirmed that the Carrara Stadium would receive a $126 million redevelopment, providing a suitable stadium for new AFL club the Gold Coast Suns. The last event at the old ground was Richmond vs Adelaide in front of 11,174 fans. On 30 October 2009, demolition of the old stadium began. By January 2010, demolition works were complete. Foundations for the grandstands as well as construction for the player and corporate facilities began in May 2010. By October 2010, the eastern grandstand was nearing completion. Just three months later in January 2011 the whole horseshoe-shaped grandstand was completed. By April 2011, the turf had been laid and the , LED-powered high-definition video board had been installed.\n\nThe redeveloped stadium cost $144.2 million to build and seats 25,000 spectators (with the ability to house an additional 15,000 temporary seats). The stadium features an AFL oval capable of accommodating an ICC-compliant cricket oval, an IAAF Athletics field and a FIFA World Cup football field, facilities for 2,000 corporate patrons, AFL team and officials’ changing facilities, AFL media facilities, and team and officials’ suites. Watpac were contracted for the construction, which was scheduled for completion in mid-2011. The stadium then played host to an International rules football in November 2011, with 12,595 watching Ireland defeat Australia by 50 points to 29. MakMax Australia was contracted to complete the fabric roof of the stadium. The stadium was opened for an open day on 22 May 2011, before the first match on 28 May 2011. The ground recorded its biggest ever crowd when 24,032 people watched the Suns play in Round 16 of the 2014 AFL season, a game the suns won by 5 points.\n\nThe venue hosted the inaugural Grand Final of AFL Women's on 25 March 2017. The Adelaide Crows defeated the Brisbane Lions 35 points to 29. The Lions won the right to host the match, but Carrara Stadium was used because the Lions' preferred venue, the Brisbane Cricket Ground, was unavailable. A men's QClash took place at Carrara Stadium on the same evening.\n\nThe Gold Coast's successful bid for the 2018 Commonwealth Games resulted in the stadium being upgraded to a temporary seating capacity of 35,000 which was dismantled after the Commonwealth Games and restored the capacity back to 25,000. The stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the games as well as the athletics.\n\nCarrara is the home ground for Australian rules football club the Gold Coast Suns, who compete in the Australian Football League (AFL), and also hosts events such as junior representative championships and QAFL games.\n\nThe Gold Coast Football Club (nicknamed the Suns) have played their home games at Carrara since mid-2011. The Queensland Government contributed $60 million towards the redevelopment of the stadium, increasing the capacity to around 25,000 of which 23,500 is seated. The Gold Coast City Council also contributed $20 million and the AFL $10 million.\n\nThe Gold Coast Suns played their first game at the reconstructed stadium on Saturday, 28 May 2011, in Round 10 of the 2011 AFL season. The Suns lost the match against by 66 points. A round 18 game against 2010 premiers attracted a then-record crowd of 23,302, selling out two months before game day. On Saturday 11 August 2012, the Suns won their first game at the venue, defeating by 30 points.\n\nCrowds would not reach in excess of 20,000 again until Round 12, 2014, when 21,354 fans watched the Suns take on the Sydney Swans in a game that marked the first time Gary Ablett, Jr. and Lance Franklin went head-to-head since defecting from their original clubs, as well as this being Franklin's first match on the Gold Coast as an AFL player. The record crowd was broken in 2014 when 24,032 attended the Suns' Round 16 game against Collingwood, which the Suns won by five points despite losing their captain Gary Ablett to a season-ending shoulder injury.\n\nThe Gold Coast District Cricket Club was formed in 1990 and shared tenancy of Carrara Stadium with the Brisbane Bears. They would continue to be based at Carrara until 1993 when they moved to Robina. The stadium hosted an international cricket match between Queensland and England in January 1991. Controversy fell over the ground when touring English players David Gower and John Morris chose to go for a joy-ride in two Tiger moth biplanes without telling the England team management and buzzed the stadium in the middle of play. Gower and Morris also posed for press photographs with the plane later that afternoon. Both players were subsequently fined £1000 for the prank, a penalty that could have been steeper had Gower elected to release the water bombs he had prepared.\n\nCarrara hosted its first international cricket match since redevelopment on November 17, 2018 with Australia taking on South Africa in a Twenty20 match in front of 12,866 spectators. For the 2018–19 Big Bash League season, Carrara will host 3 T20 games with 2 games hosted by the Brisbane Heat and another game hosted by the Melbourne Stars. The stadium remains a potential future home ground for a Gold Coast-based Big Bash League side that enters the competition.\n\nCarrara hosted a triple header of entertainment events on the Easter long weekend in 2001. The first night saw KISS perform and become the first international act to play at the Stadium. Former KISS lead guitarist and foundation band member Ace Frehley revealed in his 2011 autobiography that he punched then-tour manager Tommy Thayer in the jaw while in the dressing room at the conclusion of the Gold Coast concert in 2001. The stadium served as the venue for the last leg of the Kiss Farewell Tour and Thayer would later replace Frehley as the lead guitarist in the band. The next night saw rock legend Alice Cooper perform at the stadium. The third and final night of the long weekend saw the Anthony Mundine-Timo Masua boxing match take place at Carrara.\n\nOn 10 December 2011 the Foo Fighters performed at Carrara and set the all-time attendance record for any event ever held at Carrara Stadium, 37,000 people attended the concert. The stadium is also featured in the Foo Fighters film clip of \"These Days\". Filming took place during the concert on 10 December 2011. On 19 January 2014, the venue hosted the Gold Coast leg of Big Day Out for the first, and last, time.\n\nCarrara Stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games as well as hosting the athletics events. The athlete's village was originally going to be located next to Carrara Stadium but instead was constructed in Southport. The stadium was temporarily upgraded to hold 35,000 people prior to the start of the opening ceremony.\n\nThe stadium lacked a naming rights sponsor in its formative decades, bearing the names Carrara Stadium and Gold Coast Stadium between its opening in 1987 and 2011. On 15 March 2011, the Gold Coast Football Club announced that nationally active home builder group Metricon Homes had signed a $3 million, 5-year deal for naming rights of Carrara Stadium, to be known henceforth as Metricon Stadium. In March 2016 Metricon Homes signed a 5-year extension deal with the Suns until 25 March 2020 for the naming rights of the stadium.\n\nThe nearest railway station is Nerang, a 25-minute walk from the stadium. On match and event days, special shuttle bus services from Nerang station and Broadbeach serve the stadium. The shuttle buses travel along Route 745, a route that usually passes the stadium on non-match days. Future transport plans include a ferry service and light rail extension that will stop at the stadium.\n\n\"NOTE: This table does not include stadium attendances at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It sits where the Denver Pacific Railway broke ground on its Cheyenne line in 1868.\n\nOpening on November 8, 1951 with a six day run of Shipstads & Johnson Ice Follies, today the Denver Coliseum is an integral venue of the National Western Stock Show and hosts a multitude of other events including: commencement ceremonies, rodeos, ice shows, motor shows, circuses, concerts, motivational seminars, dances, exhibits and trade shows. Notables include: CHSAA high school volleyball, spirit and basketball playoffs & championships, Disney on Ice, The Denver March Pow Wow, The Denver Coliseum Mineral, Fossil, Gem, and Jewelry Show, Christian events, cheerleading competitions, and roller derby.\n\nWhen McNichols Sports Arena (MSA) opened in 1975, the coliseum continued as an alternate venue to the larger arena for events requiring less seating or overall space. This continues today after the opening of Pepsi Center in 1999 and the subsequent demolition of MSA in 2000.\n\nOn January 10, 1952 June Haver & Walter O'Keefe hosted the official dedication of the Coliseum on the eve of the first stock show in the arena and over the years the Coliseum hosted many celebrities and artists including: Elvis Presley (April 8, 1956 - 2 shows, November 17, 1970, April 30, 1973); The Grateful Dead (November 20 & 21, 1973); The Who (December 4&5, 1971); Frank Sinatra (May 1, 1975); The Rolling Stones (November 29, 1965; June 16, 1972); Led Zeppelin (March 25, 1970, June 21, 1972, May 25, 1973); Stevie Wonder (opening for the Rolling Stones on June 16, 1972, November 3, 1974); The Lovin’ Spoonful; The Monkees; Cream; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (November 26, 1969, May 12, 1970); Ike & Tina Turner; The Jackson 5 (August 20, 1971); Black Sabbath (February 27 & October 18, 1971); The Moody Blues; Pink Floyd (April 17, 1975); Neil Diamond (May 8, 1971); Santana; Jethro Tull; Yes; Eagles (August 2, 1972); Bob Dylan; Eric Clapton; Rammstein (May 20, 2012) and many more. \n\nThe arena has been home ice to several hockey teams from various leagues including the Denver Cutthroats (2012-14), the Denver/Colorado Rangers (1987-89), the Denver Spurs (1968-75), the Denver Invaders (1963-64) and the Denver Mavericks (1959). The coliseum was also an annual stop for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, the host of WCW's Spring Stampede (1998) and the Colorado Wildcats, of the Professional Indoor Football League.\n\nIncidents of note in the coliseum's history have taken place. Former President Dwight Eisenhower stopped in Denver on his tour of western states in support of Republican candidates on October 8, 1962. In 1976, a planned Marvin Gaye concert was canceled after learning that Gaye was at his home in Los Angeles sleeping, led to rioting at the coliseum, a series of lawsuits for fraud and deceiving ticket buyers, and giving the media a field day as the top story. On April 5, 2005, after a women's boxing fight held at the coliseum, boxer Becky Zerlentes died of her injuries following a third-round knockout loss to Heather Schmitz.

The lists in this article examine this definition of a double, while derivative sections examine much less frequent, continental instances. \"The Double\" can also mean beating a team both home and away in the same league season, a feat often noted as \"doing the double\" over a particular opponent.\n\nThe first club to achieve a double was Preston North End in 1889, winning the FA Cup and The Football League in the inaugural season of the league.\n\nThe team who holds the record for the most doubles is Linfield of Northern Ireland, with a total of 24.\n\nIn Afghanistan, there are no national cups. The Afghan Premier League is the only national football competition in the country since 2012.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1997, the double could be achieved in Australia by winning the National Soccer League and the NSL Cup.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2014, Australia had no national cup competition so the traditional league and cup double could not be achieved. Since the formation of the A-League in 2004, a double could be accomplished by winning the Premiership in the regular league season and the Championship in the finals series. The feat of winning the minor premiership and the finals during the NSL era was not officially recognised as a 'double'.\n\nFrom 2014–15, the FFA Cup will take place on an annual basis.\n\nIn Bahrain three teams have won the Double of the Bahraini Premier League and the Bahraini King's Cup.\n\nIn Bangladesh four teams have won the Double of the National Football Championship / Bangladesh Premier League and the Federation Cup.\n\nBhutan has no national cup, the Bhutan National League is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Brunei, two teams have won the Double of the Brunei Premier League / Brunei Super League and the Brunei FA Cup.\n\nIn Cambodia only one team has won the Double of the Cambodian League and the Hun Sen Cup.\n\nIn China, three teams have won the Double of the Chinese Jia-A League / Chinese Super League and the Chinese FA Cup.\n\nIn Chinese Taipei, two teams have won the Double of the Enterprise Football League / Intercity Football League and the CTFA Cup.\n\nNow in East Timor there is no national cup, the Super Liga Timorense is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Guam two teams have won the Double of the Guam Men's Soccer League and the Guam FA Cup.\n\nIn Hong Kong, nine teams have won the Double of the Hong Kong First Division League and the Hong Kong Senior Challenge Shield.\n\nIn India, three teams have won the Double of the National Football League / I-League and the Durand Cup.\n\nIn Indonesia only one team has won the Double of the Indonesia Super League / Indonesian Premier League and the Piala Indonesia.\n\nIn Iran two teams have won the Double of the Azadegan League / Iran Pro League and the Hazfi Cup.\n\nIn Iraq, four teams have won the Double of the Iraqi Premier League and the Iraq FA Cup.\n\nThe Japanese Double is generally considered to be winning the league championship (the Japan Soccer League Division 1 until 1991–92 and the J. League Division 1 since then) and the Emperor's Cup. Winning the league and the Japan Soccer League Cup or its successor the J. League Cup is rare, and rarer still is winning the Emperor's Cup and the second division title.\n\nFirst Division and Emperor's Cup\n\nFirst Division and League Cup\n\nEmperor's Cup and Second Division\n\nIn Jordan, three teams have won the Double of the Jordan Premier League and the Jordan FA Cup.\n\nIn North Korea three teams have won the Double of the DPR Korea League and the Republican Championship / Hwaebul Cup.\nIn South Korea two teams have won the Double of the First Division and the Korean National Football Championship in semi-professionla era.

The establishment of the UFL in 2009 led to annual league and cup tournaments. The institution of the PFF National Men's Club Championship (the national cup) in 2011 (next held in 2013) after years of dormancy meant that a domestic treble could now be contested. In 2013, a super cup is expected to be played, paving the way for a UFL treble.\n\nSince the establishment of the UFL in 2009, a league double has been achieved twice. A domestic double (a title each from the UFL and the PFF) or a domestic treble (a UFL double and a PFF title) has yet to be won.\nIn Qatar, three teams have won the Double of the Qatar Stars League

From 2018, the champions of League1 Ontario and the Première Ligue de soccer du Québec also join the competition. Previously, FC Edmonton the North American Soccer League (NASL) also competed in the Canadian Championship.\n\nFor Canadian teams, the Double may mean either the MLS Double, which is achieved by winning both the MLS Supporters Shield and the MLS Cup, or a league/cup Double of either the MLS Cup or Supporters Shield, in addition to the Canadian Championship.\n\nThe 2017 Double achieved by Toronto FC was part of a Treble.\n\nFive teams from the Cayman Islands have won the double of the Cayman Islands League and the Cayman Islands FA Cup.\n\nIn Costa Rica, no team has won the double of the Costa Rican Primera División and the Costa Rican Cup.\n\nIn Cuba, there is no national cup; the Campeonato Nacional is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Curaçao, there is no national cup, the Curaçao League is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Dominica, two teams have won the Double of the Dominica Premiere League and the Dominica Knock-Out Tournament (defunct).\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, there is no national cup; the Primera División is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn El Salvador, two teams have won the Double of the Salvadoran Primera División and the Copa El Salvador.\n\nIn French Guiana, four teams have won the Double of the French Guiana Championnat National and the Coupe de Guyane.\n\nIn Grenada, is no national cup, the Grenada League is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, six teams have won the Double of the Guadeloupe Division d'Honneur and the Coupe de Guadeloupe.\n\nIn Guatemala, three teams have won the Double of the Liga Nacional de Fútbol de Guatemala and the Copa de Guatemala (defunct).\n\nIn Guyana, only one team has won the Double of the National Super League and the Guyana Mayors Cup.\n\nIn Haiti, four teams have won the Double of the Ligue Haïtienne and the Coupe d'Haïti.\n\nF.C.

For 30 years, a domestic double was not possible since there existed only one national tournament. An exception was the 1967 season, when Palmeiras won the double consisting of the inaugural Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa and the final edition of the Taça Brasil.\n\nSince the founding of the Copa do Brasil in 1989, there has been only one domestic double at national level: Cruzeiro won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A and the Copa do Brasil in 2003 as part of the treble, also taking the title in their state league, the Campeonato Mineiro.\n\nTwo teams have won the Chilean double of the Chilean Primera División and Copa Chile.\n\nMillonarios is the first Colombian club to win the double, taking both the Categoría Primera A and Copa Colombia in 1953 and 1963.\nNacional became the second club in Colombia winning the double, taking both the Categoría Primera A (Apertura and Clausura) and Copa Colombia in 2013.\n\nIn Ecuador, there is no national cup; the Ecuadorian Serie A is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Paraguay, there is no national cup; the Paraguayan Primera División is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Peru, is no national cup; the Peruvian Primera División is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Uruguay, three teams have won the Double of the Uruguayan Primera División and the Copa de Competencia (defunct).\n\nTo complete the double, a club must win the Venezuelan Primera División and the Copa Venezuela.\n\nIn American Samoa, two teams have won the Double of the FFAS Senior League and the FFAS President's Cup (defunct).\n\nIn Cook Islands, five teams have won the Double of the Cook Islands Round Cup and the Cook Islands Cup.\n\nIn Fiji, two teams have won the Double of the League Championship (for Districts) and the FFA Cup.\n\nIn New Caledonia, five teams have won the Double of the New Caledonia Division Honneur and the New Caledonia Cup.\n\nBetween 1970 and 2003, five New Zealand teams have won the double of the national championship (New Zealand National Soccer League (1970–92 and 2000–04), Superclub competition (1993–95), National Summer Soccer League (1996–98) or the New Zealand island soccer leagues National Final (1999)) and the Chatham Cup. From 1993 to 2003, the league champions were determined by a knockout tournament between the top-finishing teams at the end of the season, the team that finished in first place during the league phase of the season were not officially awarded a title.\n\nFrom 2003, the league system in the country was drastically structured and saw the National Soccer League disband, with its teams now competing on a regional basis. The New Zealand Football Championship was formed and became the country's national league, exclusively ran for franchised teams as opposed to the traditional clubs that competed in the National Soccer League.\n\nAs with most franchise leagues, the Football Championship is split into two phases; the Premiership during the regular season and the Championship during the finals phase, which is contested between the top four-placed teams of the Premiership phase. The franchises are ineligible to participate in the Chatham Cup so the teams in the Football Championship don't have a cup competition to compete in.\n\nIn Palau, there is no national cup; the Palau Soccer League is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Papua New Guinea, there is no national cup; the Papua New Guinea Overall Championship is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Samoa, two teams have won the Double of the Samoa National League and the Samoa Cup.\n\nIn Solomon Islands, is no national cup; the Telekom S-League is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Tahiti, nine teams have won the Double of the Tahiti First Division and the Tahiti Cup.\n\nIn Tonga, only one team has won the Double of the Tonga Major League and the Tonga Cup (defunct).\n\nIn Albania, five teams have won the Double of the Albanian Superliga and the Albanian Cup.\nIn Andorra, three teams have won the Double of the Primera Divisió and the Copa Constitució.\nPrior to the breakup of the Soviet Union, Armenian clubs were part of Soviet competition.

Between 1935 and the suspension of cup play in 1944 because of World War II, the Double was won only once.\n\n\nPlay for what had become the DFB-Pokal was resumed following the war in 1953, and up until well after the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963, no club was able to complete the double. A new cup trophy was introduced as it was felt the previous one was associated with the Nazi period.\n\nIn the modern-day Bundesliga era, the double has been won by only four clubs. Bayern Munich holds the record, with 11.\nNote: Bayern Munich's 2013 Double was part of the club's Treble which also included their UEFA Champions League victory.\n\nFollowing World War II, a separate football competition emerged in the Russian-occupied eastern area of Germany.\nThe first division DDR-Oberliga was active from 1947–48 to 1990–91 (not held 1960–61) and saw the introduction of the FDGB-Pokal in 1949. The cup competition was not staged in 1950–51, 1952–53 and 1960–61.

Bohemians managed a similar feat in 1928 season by winning the League, FAI Cup, the League of Ireland Shield and the Leinster Senior Cup. Derry City FC completed 'The Treble' in 1988–89 by also winning the League of Ireland Cup.\n\nIn Israel, the Double can be achieved by winning the Top division championship and the Israel State Cup. The team that has won the most doubles to date is Maccabi Tel Aviv, with seven wins, followed by their city rivals, Hapoel Tel Aviv with four wins. A total of 15 doubles have been won.\n\nFive Italian clubs share eleven doubles of the Serie A championship and the Coppa Italia.\n\nNote: In 2006, Inter finished third in Serie A but were awarded the title as the highest placed club not to be involved in the 2006 Italian football scandal.

As there are no other senior football competitions in the country, and no club have never come close to winning any European tournament, the Double is the ultimate achievement for a Luxembourgian club in one season.\n\nBy far, the most successful club has been Jeunesse Esch, who have completed eight Doubles.\n\nIn the Republic of Macedonia, five teams have won the Double of the First Macedonian Football League and the Macedonian Football Cup.\nIn Malta, six teams have won the Double of the Maltese Premier League and the Maltese FA Trophy.\n\nSheriff Tiraspol were only founded in 1997, but have come to dominate the Moldovan game, winning every title from 2001 to 2010 inclusive. Seven of these were double wins (Moldovan National Division and Moldovan Cup). Sheriff, however, have never won the Moldovan Super Cup in any of their Double-winning years, though one reason for this was the Super Cup was not played in 2009 and 2010. One other club, Zimbru Chișinău, has won the double, in 1998.\n\nIn Montenegro, only one team has won the Double of the Montenegrin First League and the Montenegrin Cup.\n\nIn the Netherlands, six teams have won the Double of the Eredivisie and the KNVB Cup.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, seven teams have won the Double of the Irish League/Premier League/Premiership and the Irish Cup.\n\nIn Norway, seven teams have won the Double of the Tippeligaen and the Norwegian Football Cup.\n\nIn Poland, five teams have won the Double of the Ekstraklasa and the Polish Cup.\n\nUntil now, Legia Warsaw is the only team to achieve Domestic Treble by winning the two trophies and the Polish SuperCup title.\n\nIn Portugal, the Double is called \"Dobradinha\" and is achieved by winning the Primeira Liga and the Taça de Portugal.

Sporting CP was the first side to achieve the Double, in 1941, and the most recent one was Benfica, in 2017.\n\nIn Romania, the Double is called the Event and can be achieved by winning the Liga I and the Cupa României. The team that has won the most doubles to date is Steaua București, with nine wins, followed by their city rivals, Dinamo București with six wins. In recent times, CFR Cluj has won the Double twice, being the fourth non-Bucharest team to do so, after Universitatea Craiova, UTA Arad and Ripensia Timişoara.\nNote: Steaua București initially won the double in 1987–88 but voluntarily gave up their Cupa României title.\n\nFour Russian teams achieved the Double of the Soviet Top League and the USSR Cup in the former Soviet Union. The final Soviet championship was contested in 1991 and, following the break-up of the Soviet Union, newly independent states organised their own national competitions, with UEFA regarding the Russian Premier League and the Russian Cup as the respective successors to the old Soviet league and USSR Cup.\n\nIn San Marino six teams have won the Double of the Campionato Sammarinese di Calcio and the Coppa Titano.\nThree teams have accomplished the double of the Scottish league championship and the Scottish Cup. Only Aberdeen have managed to break the Old Firm trend, following their stint of success in the 1980s.\nNote: Celtic's 1967 Double was part of the club's Quadruple which also included their European Cup and Scottish League Cup victory.\n\nTwo teams in the current Republic of Serbia have won the Double of the Yugoslav First League and Yugoslav Cup (1923–92), the First League of FR Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro and FR Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro Cup (1992–2006), and the Serbian SuperLiga and Serbian Cup (2006–present).\n\nIn Slovakia, seven teams have won the Double of the Czechoslovak First League/Slovak Super Liga and the Czechoslovak Cup/Slovak Cup.\n\nIn Slovenia, three teams have won the Double of the Slovenian PrvaLiga and the Slovenian Football Cup.\n\nIn Spain, four teams have won the Double (\"Doblete\") of La Liga and the Copa del Rey.\nNote: Barcelona's 2009 and 2015 Doubles were part of the club's Treble which also included their UEFA Champions League victory.\n\nIn Sweden, six teams have won the Double of the Swedish championship and the Svenska Cupen.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the Svenska Cupen was not introduced until the 1941 season, while Allsvenskan started for the 1923–24 season. Svenska Cupen was also not played between 1954 and 1966. It should also be considered that winning Allsvenskan did not grant the title of Swedish champions until 1931 and between 1982 and 1992 when the title was given to the winner of other cup tournaments that were organized at the end of the league season. The number of doubles for IFK Göteborg and Malmö FF are affected by this. IFK Göteborg won the Swedish Championship together with Svenska Cupen in one additional season to the table below, they won the two titles in 1983, a year when they did not win Allsvenskan. Additionally while Malmö won Allsvenskan in 1989, they were not Swedish Championships for that season as they did not win the play-off following the ordinary league play. All other teams in the table below won the Swedish Championship in their double-winning seasons. The latest club to win a double is AIK who completed the feat in 2009. In 1982, IFK Göteborg also managed to combine its double with winning the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn Switzerland, eight teams have won the Double of the Swiss Super League and the Swiss Cup.\n\nIn Turkey, four teams have won the Double of the Süper Lig and the Turkish Cup.\nNote: Galatasaray's 2000 Double was part of the club's Treble which also included their UEFA Cup victory.\n\nPrior to the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukrainian clubs were part of Soviet competition. Since 1992, the country has had its own domestic competition. Dynamo Kyiv has four Soviet and eight Ukrainian Doubles among its honours.\n\nIn Ukraine, two teams have won the Double of the Soviet Top League/Ukrainian Premier League and the Soviet Cup/Ukrainian Cup.\n\nIn Wales, seven teams have won the Double of the Division One (1904–92) / Welsh Premier League (1992–present) and the Welsh Cup.\n\nAchieving this and also winning the Welsh League Cup would make a domestic Treble. To date, two clubs have achieved the Treble.\n\nThe Greenlandic Football Championship is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Kiribati, there is no national cup; the Kiribati National Championship is the only national football competition in the country.\n\nIn Northern Cyprus, five teams have won the Double of the Birinci Lig and the Kıbrıs Kupası/Federasyon Kupası.\n\nIn Réunion, four teams have won the Double of the Réunion Premier League and the Coupe de la Réunion.\n\nIn Zanzibar, only one team has won the Double of the Zanzibar Premier League and the Nyerere Cup.\nA rarer (though less coveted) domestic double is that of winning the league championship and the League Cup. In many leagues, this cannot be done as there is no second domestic cup competition (such as in Italy and the Netherlands) or it has been disbanded (such as in Spain and Denmark). The format of league cups and the number of participating teams can vary enormously from one country to another. In the case of Germany, it should be noted that the DFB-Ligapokal was played in the summer months prior to the Bundesliga and therefore was won in the preceding calendar year to the title win.\n\nIn many countries, knock-out competitions exclusive to clubs outside the top division(s) also exist. This gives lower ranked clubs a chance to win a double. Examples include:\n\nA very rare event. A Trans-State double occurs when a club wins a league and a cup which technically belong to two different countries and different associations. This usually happens as a result of a change in the political situation in the club's home country, or if the club has expatriated and is eligible to participate in the competitions of its native country and its adopted one.\n\nIn the same spirit as the European Treble, the European Double consists of winning the top tier European tournament (currently the UEFA Champions League) and domestic league title in a single season or calendar year. This has been achieved on 27 occasions by 15 clubs from 56 European competitions. Barcelona has achieved this on the most number of occasions (5). Ajax and Real Madrid are the only teams that have successfully defended a European Double. José Mourinho has the unique distinction of being the only manager to achieve this double with two different clubs, having done so with Porto (2004) and Internazionale (2010).\n\nIn 1994–95, Louis van Gaal's Ajax with players such as Jari Litmanen, Patrick Kluivert, Marc Overmars, Finidi George, Nwankwo Kanu, Frank de Boer, Ronald de Boer, Edgar Davids, Clarence Seedorf, Winston Bogarde, Michael Reiziger and Edwin van der Sar succeeded an unbeaten double, winning the Dutch Eredivisie with a 27–7–0 record, and the UEFA Champions League with a 7–4–0 record. Van Gaal's dream team was the only club to achieve a European Double with no defeat.\n\nThe UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup), with a domestic league title win, offers the chance for a club to win a lesser European double; but arguably a more prestigious achievement than a domestic double. This has been completed on fourteen occasions.\n\nSimilarly, there were six occasions of clubs winning their League and the now defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (CWC). No club ever won the CWC as part of a recognised treble. In the case of 1. FC Magdeburg and Dynamo Kyiv, it is also worth noting that the domestic Championships they won are also now disbanded, due to German reunification and the disintegration of the Soviet Union respectively.\n\nOutside the UEFA confederation winning the Continental Double may be won in a calendar year, rather than a single season.\n\nThere are various possible combinations of winning two knock-out competitions.\n\nA Domestic Cup Double consists of winning both domestic cup competitions in a single season or calendar year (for seasons when this double was won in conjunction with the league title see Domestic Treble). Examples include:\n\nThere have been several occasions when a club has won its association's cup or league cup and a UEFA trophy but not its League title. For European cup doubles won in conjunction with the League title, see The Treble.\n\nA combination of domestic league or cup and a lesser domestic or continental trophy may be won in the same season. Examples include (this list does not include doubles achieved as part of a treble):\n\n\nA national team cannot usually win a FIFA World Cup and their continental championship in the same year because they are usually not held in the same year (except for the Africa Cup of Nations until 2010), but one which wins both titles consecutively could be said to have \"done the double\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "102243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102243", "title": "Go professional", "text": "Go professional\n\nA Go professional is a professional player of the game of Go. The minimum standard to acquire a professional diploma through one of the major Go organisations is very high. The competition is tremendous, and prize incentives for champion players are very large. For example, the Honinbo Tournament has a grand prize of about $350,000.\n\nAlmost all professional players are from China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This is because until recently, only China (China Qiyuan), Japan (Nihon Ki-in, Kansai Ki-in), South Korea (Korea Baduk Association (Hanguk Gi-Won)), and Taiwan (Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation) had professional Go organizations. In 2012, the AGA Professional System was established in the United States. In 2014, the EGF professional System was established in Europe.\n\nProfessional rankings are separate from the amateur ratings (usually \"30 kyu\" through \"7 dan\"). Professional rankings are \"1 dan\" through \"9 dan\" (sometimes written \"1p\" through \"9p\"). In the past, a \" 1 dan\" professional was roughly equal to a (European) \"7 dan\" amateur. However, since the competition to become a professional has increased since the late-1990s (particularly in China and Korea), it has become the case that new \" 1 dan\" professionals are much stronger than they usually were in the past.\n\nThere have also been professional Go players from the West competing in East Asian professional associations, specifically Romania, Austria, Germany, Russia, Hungary, Australia, Finland and the United States of America.\n\nProfessional dan rankings are normally awarded in Japan, China, South Korea or Taiwan, through one of the professional Go associations. The attainment of professional qualification differs in different countries:\n\nMost professional players begin studying Go seriously when they are children, commonly reaching professional status in their mid to late teens. Some rare students achieve professional status at a much earlier age, such as Cho Chikun.\n\nIn order to qualify as a first dan professional (1p), one must have deep resources of game experience and study. In local positions, professionals are often on close ground with each other, understanding good shape, tesuji, life and death, fuseki and joseki patterns. However, in global positions they often differ in \"positional judgement\"—the global impact and interaction of josekis and differing importance of various parts of the board during the opening and middle game.\n\nThe strength differences between professional levels is usually considered to be no more than 2-3 handicap stones. Therefore, the difference between professional dan levels corresponds to about one-third to one-fourth of a handicap stone.\n\nEach country has different rules for promotion. Ranks may, therefore, differ somewhat from country to country.\n\nProfessionals may also differ in actual strength for a number of reasons, such as promotion not keeping up with actual gains in strength, or the fact that professional ranks (unlike kyu or amateur dan) may rise, but never fall (even if the player grows weaker). This has posed some problems, esp. with regards to international rank discernment. There are currently over one hundred people who have the rank of 9p (the highest professional rank), though many of them no longer play competitively. A further distinction is that some 9p players regularly hold titles, others won some titles, some entered the title leagues, and many 9p never had the fortune to achieve any of the above.\n\nTraditionally it has been uncommon for a low professional dan to beat some of the highest pro dans. But since the late-1990s it has slowly become more common. This trend has been primarily credited to the result of increased competition to become a professional player in China and Korea. The result, that new \"1 dan\" professionals are generally stronger than other \"1 dans\" in the past.\n\nIn Japan, the \"Oteai\" system was reformed in 2004. The goal was to help alleviate some of the rank inflation that had crept in over the years. Today's Japanese system uses various benchmarks; for example, winning certain tournaments or a certain number of games, to be promoted by a rank. The Korean and Chinese systems have also been similarly changed in the past several years. These systems have increased the importance of international tournaments by incentivising rank promotion through international placement. Recent criticism has been given to this aspect, arguing that an individual may increase many professional ranks at once through the virtue of a single competition result (such as Piao Wenyao).\n\nIn theory, professional dans should beat all levels of amateur dans. In reality, the very top amateurs have proven very able. The conventional wisdom is that such players may achieve some of the insight of a pro, though perhaps not the detailed knowledge.\n\nIn China, Korea, and Japan, there are two distinct ranking sets, one for amateur players and one for professional players (who receive a fee for each game they play, bonuses for winning, and fees for other related activities such as teaching).\n\nIn the Japanese professional ranking system, distinction between ranks was traditionally considered to be roughly one third of a handicap stone (making the difference 3 pro dan equal to one amateur dan). The strength of new professionals (1 dan) was usually comparable to that of the highest ranked amateurs. Currently the professional ranks are assumed to be more bunched together, covering not much more than two amateur dans; so that pro 1 dans win some games against 9 dans. There are also a number of amateur players acknowledged as having pro 6 dan understanding of the game.\n\nIn South Korea, there are several amateur systems in use, with the recent introduction of official 7, 6 and 5 dan amateur ranks, each of which is somewhat stronger than the corresponding European grade. A 7 dan amateur will have won three national events, and will be effectively of lower-ranked pro standard. The older gup system does not easily match others. In practice, in Korean clubs, grades may be worked out against the resident strongest amateur.\n\nThe Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation also employs a dan system similar to that in Japan. It ranks its professional players from beginner dan (初段) up to 9 dan, being the highest. However, the amateur ranking system is established by another organization which certifies amateur player through competitions, ranking player from beginner dan (初段) to 6 dan with 7 dan being honorary.\n\nIn Germany and the Netherlands a \"classes\"-system (German: \"Klassen\") was established by Go pioneer Bruno Rüger in 1920. It comprised a further subdivision into Kyu/Dan half-grades with classes 18 and 17 = amateur 1 dan with the 17 being on the stronger side. It was replaced by the Japanese amateur ranking system in the 1970s.\n"}

{"id": "13698728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13698728", "title": "Icing the kicker", "text": "Icing the kicker\n\nIn the sports of American football or Canadian football, the act of icing the kicker or freezing the kicker is a tactic employed by defending teams to disrupt the process of kicking a field goal just prior to the snap. Typically, either a player or a coach on the defending team will call a timeout just as the kicker is about to attempt a game-tying or game-winning field goal. This is intended to either stop the kick immediately as the kicker is mentally prepared, or allow for the kicker to kick immediately after the timeout so that the initial kick does not count, in an attempt to mentally disrupt the kicker for the actual kick. If the tactic is successful, the kicker will miss the kick due to choking. Should the kicker make the subsequent kick, then the attempt to ice the kicker is considered unsuccessful.\n\nThis tactic is also common in basketball, known as icing the shooter. A team may call a time out just before the opposing team's free-throw shooter is given the ball on the final free throw, in an attempt to disrupt the shooter, typically if a missed free throw allows for the calling team to either have a chance to win the game with a successful field goal, or allows the calling team to preserve a lead.\n\nOne variant of this tactic, attributed to former Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan, is to call time out from the sidelines just before the ball is snapped. This prevents the kicking team from realizing the kick will not count until after the play is over. However, this has the potential to backfire: the invalid first kick could miss or be blocked, only to be followed by a successful second kick.\n\nIn their book \"Scorecasting\", Tobias J. Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim analyzed “pressure” kicks from 2001 through 2009 while controlling for the distance of the field-goal attempt. They found that icing the kicker certainly does not produce the desired effect, and in some cases might even backfire. Moskowitz found that when an opposing coach iced the kicker with 15 seconds or fewer left to go in the game, those kickers tended to be more accurate.\n\nA study was also undertaken by Scott Berry, a statistician and the former chairman of the Statistics in Sports section of the American Statistical Association, and Craig Wood, a biostatistician, life-long Pittsburgh Steeler fan, who won the Inaugural Henry Hood Center for Health Research Pillar Award, was published in 2004 in the journal \"Chance\". Berry and Wood looked at every field-goal attempt made in the 2002 and 2003 NFL seasons, including playoffs, and concluded that, for \"pressure kicks\" – those made with 3 minutes or less remaining in the game or overtime period which would tie the game or put the kicking team in the lead – in the 40-55 yard range, icing the kicker caused the percentage of successful attempts to drop by about ten percent for an average kicker on a sunny day. On shorter kicks, the effect was found to be negligible. However, the statistical significance of the difference found – which amounted to four kicks out of 39 attempts – has been questioned, and an examination by Nick Stamms of STATS, Inc. found that \"pressure kicks\" (defined as above except within two minutes, not three) in the NFL regular season from 1991 to 2005 showed an insignificant difference between non-iced kicks (457 out of 637, or 71.7%) and iced kicks (152 out of 211 or 72%).\n"}

He succeeded to the dukedom in 1769 on the death of his uncle, Charles Sackville, 2nd Duke of Dorset. He was the British Ambassador to France between 1783 and 1789 in the lead up to the French Revolution.\n\nHe is best remembered for his love of cricket. He was both a good player and an important patron, but his interest was sharpened by gambling, cricket being a major attraction for gamblers throughout the 18th century. His other sporting interests included billiards and tennis, he also acquired a reputation as a womaniser.\n\nHe was returned unopposed as the Member of Parliament for the county of Kent in 1768, sitting until he became the 3rd Duke of Dorset on the death of his uncle in 1769.\n\nHe was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Kent in 1769, a position he held until 1797. He was Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1789 until his death.\n\nThe young John Sackville was schooled at Westminster, where he first became a noted proponent of cricket. He went on to join Hambledon Cricket Club, based in Hambledon, Hampshire, which was the leading cricket club of the day. He was joined there by Sir Horatio Mann, a Carthusian, and Lord Tankerville of Eton and Surrey, who was his keenest rival.\n\nDorset gained a reputation as a keen competitor. The \"Morning Post\" in 1773 wrote: \"The Duke...having run a considerable number of notches from off strokes, the opposing fielders very unpolitely swarmed round his bat so close as to impede his making a full stroke; his Grace gently expostulated with them on this unfair mode, and pointed out their danger, which having no effect, he, with proper spirit made full play at a ball and in so doing brought one of the gentlemen to the ground\".\n\nIn the same year, Dorset presented the Vine Cricket Ground, Sevenoaks, Kent, to the town, at a peppercorn rent, literally. It is one of the oldest cricket grounds in England. The first nationally reported cricket match had taken place here in the 1734 season when \"The Gentlemen of Kent\" beat \"The Gentlemen of Sussex\". Sevenoaks Town Council still has the Vine Cricket Club, though the rent doubled to two peppercorns after the pavilion was built in the 19th century. They must also pay the Lord Sackville (if asked) one cricket ball on 21 July each year.\n\nIn 1775, a full-scale riot broke out at the Artillery Ground when Dorset's side was not performing too well. In 1782 the \"Morning Chronicle\" noted that \"His Grace is one of the few noblemen who endeavour to combine the elegance of modern luxury with the more manly sports of the old English times\".\n\nDorset's patronage of cricket was expensive — the \"Whitehall Evening Post\" in 1783 noted that the cost to Dorset of maintaining his team, before bets, was £1,000 a year. This was a lot, but less than the amounts some of his contemporaries were spending on racing. The report went to say that Dorset was unrivalled (among noblemen) \"at cricket, tennis and billiards\".\n\nIn 1784 Dorset moved to Paris, surprising his critics with newfound public dedication, to serve as ambassador to France. On 16 July 1789, two days after the Storming of the Bastille he reported to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds, \"Thus, my Lord, the greatest revolution that we know anything of has been effected with, comparatively speaking—if the magnitude of the event is considered—the loss of very few lives. From this moment we may consider France as a free country, the King a very limited monarch, and the nobility as reduced to a level with the rest of the nation.\"\n\nHe continued to promote cricket amongst the locals and British expatriates. In 1786 \"The Times\" reported on a cricket match played by some English gentlemen in the Champs-Elysées:\n\nThe following year \"The Times\" noted that horse-racing was losing popularity in France, with cricket, on Dorset's recommendation, taking its place. In 1789 Dorset planned what might have become the first international cricket tour. His touring side, which included William Yalden, William Bedster and Lumpy Stevens, got as far as congregating on 10 August at Dover. But the French Revolution meant that they never got to France, thereby making his tour the first international cricket tour to be cancelled for political reasons. Just as the American Civil War 80 or so years later destroyed the prospect of cricket becoming popular there, so the French Revolution destroyed any footholds the game had in France.\n\nBack in England, Dorset became one of the first members of the Marylebone Cricket Club; his public life continued in the post of Steward of the Royal Household — in which capacity his main role was to keep an eye on the dissolute Prince of Wales, the future George IV.\n\nDorset was a notorious womanizer. Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton became Prime Minister and his mistress Anne Parsons had the influence, if not the position, of a First Lady in her country. The Duke divorced his wife on the 23 March 1769. Parsons may have become the First Minister's wife had he not discovered that Parsons was having an affair with Sackville.\nSackville's best-known and most enduring mistress was the Venetian ballerina Giovanna Zanerini, who was the principal ballerina at the King's Theatre, Haymarket, and used the stage name Giovanna Baccelli. Dorset commissioned a painting of her in 1780–81 from Thomas Gainsborough, which is reckoned to be one of Gainsborough's later masterpieces. He also commissioned a painting by Joshua Reynolds and a sculpture showing her nude and prone on a divan and cushions; this is still to be found at Knole. When made Ambassador to France, Dorset even took her to Paris with him, and she danced at the Opera by invitation. (When he was made Knight of the Garter (KG), she wore the blue ribbon of the Garter while dancing) Dorset and Giovanna had a son together: John Frederick Sackville (1778–1796), who was raised by his father at Paris and Knole after the couple parted in 1789.\n\nThe Duke was also known for his affair (ca. 1777–1779) with the Countess of Derby, and briefly (ca. 1784) with Lady Elizabeth Foster, daughter of Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol and mistress of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire. The first affair was notable because it did not lead to a divorce. The Countess of Derby was born Lady Elizabeth Hamilton, the only daughter of the 6th Duke of Hamilton and the beauty Elizabeth Gunning. However, the Earl of Derby refused to divorce his errant wife. This meant that Lady Derby was ostracized for the remainder of her life, and Dorset soon lost interest and abandoned his lover. He was received back into society, and even received by his former mistress's betrayed husband Lord Derby.\n\nIn 1790, after returning from France, Dorset married twenty-three-year-old Arabella Diana Cope (1767-1825), daughter and co-heiress of Sir Charles Cope, 2nd Baronet, and stepdaughter of Charles Jenkinson, 1st Earl of Liverpool. Dorset and Arabella had one son together, George John Frederick, who was born on 15 November 1793, and two daughters, Lady Mary Sackville, born on 30 July 1792, and Lady Elizabeth Sackville, born on 11 August 1795. The Duke died in 1799, aged 54, and left a life interest in his estates and free disposition thereof (in case of the death of their young son) to his wife. At his death, Arabella, Duchess of Dorset was thus a very wealthy heiress and from 1799 until her own death in 1825, Arabella, Duchess of Dorset (as she preferred to be known) controlled the Sackville estates and wealth in trust for their son. She remarried 1801 Charles Whitworth, who became 1st Earl of Whitworth, but had no further issue.\n\nGeorge John Frederick became the 4th Duke of Dorset on his father's death at the family seat, Knole House, near Sevenoaks, Kent at the age of only 6 but spent the rest of his life under the legal and financial control of his mother and stepfather. He died in a riding accident in Ireland, aged 21 having just become engaged to Lady Elizabeth Thynne (b. 1795), elder daughter of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath. (She went on to marry October 1816 Lord Cawdor and have many children). Although the dukedom passed to his cousin Charles, Viscount Sackville, the estates remained at the disposition of Arabella until her own death in 1825, when Knole went to her elder daughter Mary, Countess of Plymouth, and Buckhurst and the Middlesex lands (of the Cranfield family) to her younger daughter Elizabeth, Countess De La Warr.\n\nLady Mary Sackville had married firstly Other Windsor, 6th Earl of Plymouth (1789-1833) on 5 August 1811 and secondly her first husband's stepfather William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst on 25 May 1839. She died childless on 20 July 1864, leaving her estates to her sister Countess De La Warr and her heirs male. \n\nThe Countess De La Ware was created Baroness Buckhurst in her own right (a title later inherited by a younger son Reginald who is ancestor of the present Earl De La Warr). Another line stemming from this lady is that of the Barons Sackville, a title created in compensation for losing the Buckhurst title. The 1st Baron Sackville inherited Knole, according to the will of Mary, Countess of Plymouth. (He died unmarried, as did his brother the 2nd Baron). Their nephew, the 3rd Baron Sackville, was father of the writer Vita Sackville-West who created a garden at Sissinghurst. Knole House, still lived in by the Sackville-West family, and Sissinghurst, the family home of Lord Carnock have both been given to the National Trust.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5687182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5687182", "title": "Spectrum Stadium", "text": "Spectrum Stadium\n\nSpectrum Stadium (formerly known as Bright House Networks Stadium) is an American football stadium located in Orlando, Florida, United States, on the main campus of the University of Central Florida. It is the home field of the UCF Knights of NCAA Division I FBS college football.\n\nThe stadium opened in 2007 as a replacement for Camping World Stadium (then known as the Citrus Bowl) in Downtown Orlando, where the Knights had played since their inaugural season in 1979. The steel and brick-clad stadium was designed by 360 Architecture and constructed in 18 months. The stadium underwent an $8 million renovation following the 2014 season. The Wayne Densch Center for Student-Athlete Leadership was built on the east facade of the stadium, and a party deck was added to the east stands. Since the renovations, its seating capacity is 44,206. The attendance record as of the 2017 season was 48,453 for an October 18, 2009 match-up against the Miami Hurricanes. \n\nThe stadium is known as The Bounce House, as it was found to be susceptible to considerable shaking when its crowd jumps in unison. Although it was stated that the stadium was structurally sound and that this effect would not cause long-term damage to the facility, measures were undertaken following the stadium's inaugural season to reduce these effects.\n\nSpectrum Stadium is located on the northeastern edge of UCF's main campus, which is approximately northeast of Downtown Orlando and southwest of Daytona Beach. The stadium is a part of the Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village and is bordered by McCulloch Road on the north side, Knights Plaza on the west side, and Orion Boulevard on the southern and eastern sides.\n\nTo the west in Knights Plaza is the CFE Arena, The Venue, John Euliano Park, and the UCF Track and Soccer Complex. Also located in Knights Plaza are The Towers residence halls, housing 2,000 UCF students, including student-athletes.\n\nOn March 31, 2005, UCF received the results of a feasibility study it commissioned on whether it should build an on-campus football stadium. On April 14, 2005, the UCF Board of Trustees approved the construction of an on-campus stadium. The stadium, initially known as \"UCF Stadium,\" was scheduled to be completed in time for the 2006 football season. However, the Board of Trustees delayed construction until March 2006 due to the concerns from local residents regarding potentially falling property values and noise levels from the stadium.\n\nConstruction on the new stadium began on March 22, 2006. The stadium was originally built without water fountains. The university argued that the building code used when the stadium was approved did not require water fountains. However, this claim turned out to be incorrect because the 2004 Florida building code (in effect in 2005, when the UCF Board of Trustees approved the stadium design) mandated that stadiums and other public arenas must have one water fountain for every 1,000 seats, or half that number of fountains if water was also available for sale.\n\nOn May 9, 2006, it was announced that the Texas Longhorns would be the first opponent for the UCF Knights in the new stadium. The game, the first of three scheduled meetings between the schools, was held September 15, 2007. A sellout crowd of 45,622 saw the Knights put a scare into the Longhorns before falling 35–32.\n\nDuring the opening game, vendors ran out of water at halftime, leading to the hospitalization of 18 people for heat exhaustion. In order to correct the issue, UCF provided a free bottle of water to each person at the next game and immediately began work to install at least 50 water fountains throughout the stadium in order to comply with the 2004 building code requirement.\n\nThe stadium's naming rights were sold to cable provider Bright House Networks, naming the facility Bright House Networks Stadium. In 2016, Bright House Networks was acquired by Charter Communications; in accordance with Charter's trade name for its cable services, the facility was renamed Spectrum Stadium in April 2017.\n\nOn April 7, 2018, the Alliance of American Football (AAF) announced that Orlando would host one of the AAF's first franchises, the Orlando Apollos, and that the team would play at Spectrum Stadium beginning in 2019, the league's inaugural season.\n\nUCF unveiled banners on Roth Tower honoring the team's conference championships, New Year's Six/BCS bowl wins, and their self-declared National Championship at the football team's 2018 spring game.\nThe stadium was designed for a planned expansion to 65,000 seats. UCF plans to begin the expansion by expanding the Roth Tower with more suites and club seating, and also adding an additional 10,000 seats in a third level on the east side of the stadium, increasing the stadium's capacity to 56,000.\n\nThe capacity for the 2015 season dropped by 1,117 seats when UCF removed seats on the east sidelines to construct the \"Carl Black and Gold Cabana,\" which includes a bar, catered barbecue, and padded seats above the bar. In 2017, private field-level cabanas were erected in the south endzone, adjacent to the new J. & J. Rosengren Lounge. In 2018, additional field-level cabanas were added to the north endzone, as well as Loge cabana tables along the top rim of the grandstands.\n\nIn 2016, UCF removed its original scoreboard, located at the north end of the stadium, and replaced it with a full LED scoreboard measuring 114 ft x 36 ft. One year later, UCF replaced the stadium's original auxiliary scoreboard, located at the south end of the stadium, and replaced it with a ribbon board that measures approximately .\n\nIn 2017, the university sued the architects and contractors that designed and constructed the stadium. Cited in the lawsuit were claims of \"defects and deficiencies\" which ostensibly led to \"premature wear of the steel,\" as well as visible rust issues.\n\nThe highest attendance for games played at Spectrum Stadium against the Knights have included the South Florida Bulls, the Miami Hurricanes, and the South Carolina Gamecocks.\n\nThe stadium is also known as \"The Bounce House\" because the stadium vibrates and shakes when fans jump in unison, most notably when Zombie Nation's song \"Kernkraft 400\" is played. While many fans like this feature, some are uneasy with the bouncing. Stadium officials claimed the stadium was structurally sound, and an independent contractor confirmed that the bouncing will not damage the stadium and shorten its expected 50–year useful life. Still, a project was begun prior to the 2008 season to reinforce the stadium superstructure and mitigate the bouncing effect.\n\nWhile the bouncing has been greatly reduced by the stadium reinforcements, it is still noticeable - sometimes enough to shake TV cameras during televised games. For the 2010 Conference USA Football Championship Game, ESPN set up a camera position outside of the stadium to eliminate camera bounce caused by fans.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

{"id": "3750798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3750798", "title": "Star (football badge)", "text": "Star (football badge)\n\nIn football, some national and club sides include one or more stars as part of (or beside) the badge (often referred to as a \"crest\") appearing on their shirt, to represent important trophies the team has previously won. Often this is a unilateral decision by a team itself, rather than a specific privilege earned or sanctioned by any governing body and as such, the relevance of these stars on a club's shirt is somewhat tenuous.\n\nThe first team in association football history to adopt a star was Juventus, who added one above their badge in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, at the time, the new national record. This was an extension of the existing convention by which the reigning champions are entitled to display the scudetto on their shirts for the following season. The star was later formally adopted by some organisations as a symbol for ten titles, and the ratio of one star for ten titles has become the \"most common\" arrangement.\n\nJuventus unofficially won their 30th league title in 2011–12, but a dispute with the Italian Football Federation, who stripped Juventus of their 2004–05 and 2005–06 titles due to their involvement in a 2006 Italian football scandal, left their official total at 28. However, they elected to wear no stars at all the following season. Juventus won their 30th title in 2013–14 and thus earned the right to wear their third star, however, club president Andrea Agnelli stated that the club suspended the use of the stars until another team wins their 20th championship, thus having the right to wear two stars, \"to emphasise Juventus' superiority\". However, for the 2015–16 season, Juventus reintroduced the stars and added the third star to their jersey as well with new kit manufacturers Adidas.\n\nIn Scotland, Rangers displayed five stars above the badge on their shirts in 2003 to symbolise their 50 league titles. Celtic have one star above their badge to represent their triumph in the 1967 European Cup. Aberdeen displayed two stars to commemorate their 1980s wins in the European Cup Winners' Cup and European Super Cup.\nFootball in Germany has two official star systems operating in parallel. In 2004, the DFL, which governs the Bundesliga (the top two divisions), introduced \"Verdiente Meistervereine\" (roughly \"distinguished champion clubs\"). This has a sliding scale of 1, 2, 3, and 4 stars for 3, 5, 10, and 20 titles. It includes only Bundesliga titles, excluding titles from before the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963, and from the former East German League. Dynamo Berlin (playing in the fourth level) unilaterally began wearing three unapproved stars for its East German titles. In November 2005, the DFB, which governs non-Bundesliga football, allowed former champions playing outside the Bundesliga to display a single star inscribed with the number of titles. In 2007, Dynamo Berlin switched to a single approved star inscribed with the number 10. Greuther Fürth retains three silver stars on its club badge, but not on its shirts.\n\nMajor League Soccer's previously informal system, one star per MLS Cup title, was standardised in 2006, with the defending champions wearing the MLS Scudetto, like the Serie A system, for one season before adding a new star. Starting in 2012, the Scudetto was replaced with a single gold star worn by reigning champions above any other silver championship stars. In 2016, this system changed again in recognition of the LA Galaxy's fifth championship title: champion clubs during their title defence will wear a large gold star (featuring the year of the league win) above other smaller stars set in silver; clubs with five championships (presently only the Galaxy) will wear one gold star; and teams with one-to-four MLS Cup wins will wear one silver star for each victory. In Australia, they also use a system based around different coloured stars for different trophy wins: Australian winners of the AFC Champions League will wear a gold star inscribed with the number of wins, while A-League and W-League victory is recognised with a silver star similarly embossed; reigning league or FFA Cup champions will also wear a gold competition emblem in the season following the championship.\n\nIn Norway a team will display a star for every 10 titles in Tippeligaen. Rosenborg is the only team with more than 10 titles. Since 2006, all Swedish football clubs that have won ten or more Swedish championships have added a star above their badge. Malmö FF added a second star following its 20th championship title win in 2017. The same system has applied in the Dutch Eredivisie from the 2007–08 season onwards. This innovation was suggested by PSV, after the club won its twentieth title in 2007. Ajax currently have the right to wear three stars since they have won the league more than 30 times. PSV have the right to wear two stars with their 21 league titles, while Feyenoord and HVV Den Haag can add one for their 15 and 10 titles, respectively. HVV won all titles before 1915 and is currently playing in the fourth level of the Dutch league system. In Malta, Floriana, Valletta and Sliema Wanderers boast 2 Golden Stars on their badges having won 25, 20 and 26 titles, respectively, while Hibernians have one star thanks to their 10 titles. No other team in the Maltese League has the golden star on their badge.\nOccasionally, stars are added to badges of successor or phoenix clubs for the achievements of defunct predecessors. An example of this is the Tampa Bay Rowdies. They added a star to represent the Soccer Bowl, the championship of the original NASL, won by the original Tampa Bay Rowdies in 1975. The club has since added a second star, after the new club won the 2012 edition of the resurrected Soccer Bowl in the new NASL. This approach is atypical: neither the Montreal Impact nor the Seattle Sounders FC franchises retained the stars worn by the old clubs when they joined the MLS. In the case of the Impact, the new team paid tribute to the former team's first title through the stripes on their badge.\n\nAs well as predecessor clubs, victories in the national leagues of defunct countries have also been represented by stars. FC Dynamo Kyiv have two stars, commemorating championships won in the Soviet and Ukrainian football league systems. The same is true of Belgrade clubs Partizan and Red Star who have won titles in Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro and present-day Serbia, while Spartak Moscow's stars refer to their Soviet Top League and Russian Football Premier League achievements.\n\nThe star has given rise to a byword to winning trophies. Examples of this include when Fawaz Al-Hasawi, owner of Nottingham Forest, was quoted as saying \"maybe [Nottingham Forest] will have a third star\", and France international Paul Pogba's comments in the days before the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final: \"Croatia do not have stars – they want one. They have done very well and they want the victory, like us. But I do not have a star. It’s on the shirt, but I did not win it. We want to go looking for it like all players.\"\n\nBrazil had two stars above their badge in 1968. It was used briefly (friendly matches only) and then removed. After winning their third World Cup in 1970, three stars was officially added and Italy did likewise in 1982. Germany added three in 1996, one in each of the German flag's colours. All world champions have since followed suit. Brazil, Italy, and Germany have since added more stars, after they won later tournaments (cf. 1994, 2002, 2006, 2014), while France are the most recent nation to add a star, commemorating their 2018 triumph less than an hour after victory in the Final.\n\nUruguay display four stars, regarding their triumphs in the 1924 and 1928 Olympics as equivalent to their later World Cup wins, as there was no World Cup at the time. \"Eurosport\" claim that FIFA only recognises the two World Cup wins, while the \"Daily Mail\" state that \"when FIFA revised its constitution in 1950, they formally recognised that Uruguay were four-time world champions\".\n\nIn the equipment regulations for FIFA competitions, section 16.1 states \" Those Member Associations that have won one or more of the previous \neditions of the FIFA World Cup™ or the FIFA Women’s World Cup™ may display on the Playing Equipment used by their first men’s or women’s representative teams a five-pointed star, or other symbol as instructed by FIFA, per edition of the FIFA World Cup™ (men’s shirt) or FIFA Women’s World Cup™ (women’s shirt) won by the Member Association\" The form of symbol is now specified, the accompanying illustrative example depicts a gold star.\n\nMore recently, club teams have added stars either upon winning a landmark trophy, or in response to a rival team's having added stars. In the Romanian first league, Steaua uses 2 stars above their badge since they won their 20th title. Since then Dinamo added a star for the 18 championships they won. Manchester United sported a star in their UEFA Champions League matches on their special European home kit between 1997 and 1999. To celebrate their second victory that year, they added an extra star to that kit for the 1999–00 season. Liverpool likewise wore four stars in 2001–02, their first campaign in the competition since the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. They wore five stars in the competition in 2005–06 after their fifth victory. Instead of stars, UEFA introduced a \"multiple winner badge\" in 2000–01 season, currently worn by five teams who have won the Champions League either five times or more in total, or three times in a row.\nOccasionally, stars are temporarily added for one season, usually to commemorative kits to celebrate the anniversary of a particular event in the club's history. Burnley sported two stars on their 2006–07 shirt, for the club's 125th anniversary, to celebrate their two league titles in 1921 and 1960. Likewise Bury in 2009–10, also for their 125th anniversary, commemorating their 1900 and 1903 FA Cup triumphs; Bury have since revived the stars, from 2011–12, after a season's absence. Commemorating anniversaries in this way is not confined to English clubs: Peruvian side Universitario celebrated their 90th anniversary by adding 26 stars to their kits worn home and away. This is not a practice limited to clubs, as in 2004, Denmark wore a star on their shirts specially for Euro 2004, to commemorate their victory in the competition in 1992.\n\nIn women's football, the emerging ad hoc standard is to wear stars on the sleeve instead of above the badge. Two of the four teams that have won the FIFA Women's World Cup to date — Norway and Germany — use this practice, as did three-time Women's World Cup winners, the USA, until moving the stars to the back collar in 2007. The United States has returned its two stars to above the badge on their new uniforms for the 2011 Women's World Cup, and have added a third since their 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup championship.\nThe practice of using stars to signify major titles has spread to other football codes, and to unrelated sports. For example, in 2009, Meath senior Gaelic football team began wearing seven stars on their jerseys, signifying their seven All-Ireland Senior Football Championships. In rugby union, Toulon added a star above its badge after winning the Heineken Cup in 2013, added a second star immediately after winning the same competition in 2014 and a third after winning the inaugural European Rugby Champions Cup in 2015; English rugby union side Sale Sharks wear a gold star in tribute to their sole Premiership title. In basketball, the men's team of Indiana University Bloomington added five stars to its shorts, representing its five NCAA championships, for the 2015 NCAA tournament, and made the stars at that location a permanent fixture for the 2015–16 season.\n\nExcluding the temporary stars, the following teams have chosen to add stars to their shirts:\n\n\"Note: Some women teams, like France, Italy or Brazil, wear the men's stars on their jersey.\"\n\nAmerican club Philadelphia Union has 13 stars that represent the 13 original colonies of the United States. Fellow Major League Soccer franchise Montreal Impact have four stars on their badge, which are symbolic of the nationalities of the peoples who founded the city of Montreal. The four nations are regularly used in Montreal imagery, as the city flag and coat of arms both reference them.\n\nThe badge of Peñarol of Uruguay has 11 stars for the 11 players.\n\nThe badge introduced by Manchester City in 1997 had three stars to give it a \"more continental feel\". The 3 stars do not represent titles or trophies. City brought in a new club badge in 2016 with no stars on it. Sivasspor of Turkey also has three stars on their badge. They do not represent any championships either.\n\nPortsmouth F.C. has featured a star (of various designs) in its badge since 1913. The star does not represent trophies or titles won, instead, the Portsmouth badge was based upon symbols found in the official coat of arms owned by Portsmouth City Council.\n\nFor the 2002–03 season, the badge of Greek club Panathinaikos F.C. had 3 stars. One gold representing the team's partaking in the 1971 European Cup Final, and 2 white stars representing the team's participation at the 1985 European Cup semi-finals and the 1996 UEFA Champions League semi-finals respectively. Because none of these stars represent titles or trophies, opposition fans in Greece mocked this.\n\nJohor Darul Takzim F.C. has 3 stars above its badge, for each time the club changed its name; from PKENJ to Johor and finally Johor Darul Takzim.\n\nFollowing the crash of LaMia Flight 2933, Brazilian club Chapecoense incorporated a star into its badge as a tribute to those who perished in the incident.\n"}
{"id": "2001950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001950", "title": "Tim Noakes", "text": "Tim Noakes\n\nTimothy David Noakes (born 1949) is a South African scientist, and an emeritus professor in the Division of Exercise Science and Sports Medicine at the University of Cape Town. He is also a member of the National Research Foundation of South Africa, who list him as one of their highest-rated members. He has run more than 70 marathons and ultramarathons, and is the author of several books on exercise and diet. He is known for his support of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet, as set out in his books \"The Real Meal Revolution\" and \"Lore of Nutrition: Challenging Conventional Dietary Beliefs\".\n\nNoakes was born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (today Harare, Zimbabwe) in 1949 and moved to South Africa at the age of five. His father had arrived in what was then Southern Rhodesia in 1946, establishing a successful tobacco exporting company that he sold in 1954. As a young boy his main sporting interest was cricket. Noakes attended Monterey Preparatory School in Constantia, Cape Town. One year was spent as a foreign exchange student at Huntington Park High School in Huntington Park, California. Prep school was followed by Diocesan College. He has earned an MBChB (1974), MD (1981), and DSc (Med) (2002).\n\nIn 1980 Noakes was tasked to start a sports science course at the University of Cape Town. Noakes went on to head the Medical Research Council-funded Bioenergetics of Exercise Research Unit, which was later changed to the MRC/UCT Research Unit for Exercise Science and Sports Medicine.\n\nIn the early 1990s Noakes co-founded the Sports Science Institute of South Africa, with former South African rugby player Morne du Plessis. His unit's physiological research has produced over 370 scientific articles since 1996.\n\nHe is a leading researcher on the condition now known as Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). He first recognized this condition in a female runner during the 1984 Comrades Marathon, and published his findings in 1985 in the journal \"Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise\". Noakes hosted the 1st International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference in Cape Town in May 2005.\n\nNoakes is also known for renewing and elaborating the idea first proposed by the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Archibald Hill that a central governor regulates exercise to protect body homeostasis. \nIn 2005 he undertook a series of pioneering experiments in the Arctic and Antarctic on South African (British-born) swimmer Lewis Gordon Pugh to understand the full range of human capability in extreme cold. He discovered that Pugh had the ability to raise his core body temperature before entering the water in anticipation of the cold and coined the phrase 'anticipatory thermo-genesis' to describe it. \n\nIn 2007, Noakes was the expedition doctor for Pugh’s one kilometer swim at the Geographic North Pole.\n\nNoakes has written several books detailing his research in sports science and nutrition. A selected bibliography is given below.\n\n\nThe low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, often referred to as the \"Tim Noakes\", \"Banting\" or LCHF diet in South Africa, has gained considerable popularity in the country since 2010, but has also drawn a significant amount of criticism. Noakes has claimed, among others, that high blood cholesterol is not a contributing factor to heart disease, and he has been criticized for publishing a series of case reports as a scientific paper.\n\nIn an open letter (dated 22 August 2014) to the Cape Times, fellow University of Cape Town (UCT) academics argued against Noakes's dietary ideas. The letter was signed by Wim de Villiers (Dean, Faculty of Health Sciences), Bongani Mayosi (Head, Department of Medicine), Lionel Opie (Hatter Institute of Cardiology, Department of Medicine) and Marjanne Senekal (Head, Division of Human Nutrition). The letter was copied to Noakes and several others. In the letter the academics expressed, among others, \"...serious concern that Professor Timothy Noakes, a colleague respected for his research in sports science, is aggressively promoting this diet as a ‘revolution’, making outrageous unproven claims about disease prevention, and maligning the integrity and credibility of peers who criticise his diet for being evidence-deficient and not conforming to the tenets of good and responsible science. This goes against the University of Cape Town’s commitment to academic freedom as the prerequisite to fostering responsible and respectful intellectual debate and free enquiry.\"\n\nNoakes, also in the form of an open letter to the Cape Times, responded to the criticism by his colleagues. He accused the UCT Faculty of Health Sciences of consistently misrepresenting his public message \"...which is simply the following: a high carbohydrate diet is detrimental to the health of persons with insulin resistance whereas carbohydrate restriction in this group can be profoundly beneficial as it can reverse obesity and in some cases Type 2 diabetes mellitus, the two conditions that will ultimately bankrupt South African medical services unless we take appropriate preventive actions.\" He described the denial by the UCT Faculty of Health Sciences of peer-reviewed evidence in support of his views as \"a classic example of cognitive dissonance.”\n\nIn February 2014 Claire Julsing-Strydom, President of the Association for Dietetics in South Africa (ADSA), reported Noakes to the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) for advising a mother on Twitter that she should wean her child onto low-carbohydrate high-fat foods, which he described as real foods. \"By implication I was saying that the child should not be weaned onto the traditional high sugar, high carbohydrate processed cereals.\" In response to the complaint, the Professional Conduct Committee of the HPCSA, chaired by Advocate Joan Adams, set up a hearing into the allegation of unprofessional conduct against Noakes. The hearing was scheduled for 4 June 2015, but following complaints from Noakes's legal team that the Committee was not properly constituted in accordance with the applicable regulations and the provisions of the Health Professions Act, its commencement was delayed until November 2015. The first session of the hearing took place from 23 to 30 November 2015, after which proceedings were postponed to February 2016. The second session resumed on 8 February and ended on 16 February 2016. The hearing resumed on 17 October 2016. Controversially, on 28 October, the HPSCA mistakenly released a statement announcing that Noakes had been found guilty of misconduct. In a second press release issued over three hours later, the HPSCA apologized for the mistake. The hearing was again postponed until April 2017. Noakes was cleared of misconduct on 21 April 2017.\n\nThe HPSCA filed an appeal on 2nd day of August 2017. 8 June 2018 the appeal was dismissed in a unanimous ruling.\n\nNoakes has challenged some common and old paradigms in the discipline of exercise physiology. In 1996 he was honored by the American College of Sports Medicine when he was asked to present the J.B. Wolfe Memorial Lecture, the college's keynote address at its annual meeting. In 2002 he was awarded a Doctorate in Science (DSc). In 2002 Noakes was awarded the International Cannes Grand Prix Award for Research in Medicine and Water, for his work on Exercise-associated Hyponatremia (EAH). In 2004 Runner’s World (USA) included this work as one of the 40 most important “persons or events” in the sport of running in the past 40 years. In 2008 he was elected an honorary fellow of the Faculty of Sports and Exercise Medicine (UK), the first foreigner to be so recognised. In that year he also received the Order of Mapungubwe (Silver), from the President of South Africa for his “excellent contribution in the field of sports and the science of physical exercise”. In 2011 Noakes was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands. In 2012 he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from South Africa's National Research Foundation for his contribution to sports science research. In 2014 the Southern Africa Association for the Advancement of Science (S2A3) awarded Noakes their prestigious South Africa Medal (gold) for his outstanding contributions to sport physiology.\n"}
