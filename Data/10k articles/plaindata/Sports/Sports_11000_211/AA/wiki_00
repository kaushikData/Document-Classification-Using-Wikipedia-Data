Cheshire first used the ground in 1910 when they played Northumberland in the Minor Counties Championship. Prior to and after World War I, Cheshire played a match annually at the ground, until World War II. Following the war Cheshire returned to the ground in 1951, however this would be their last match there until 1970. In 1972, the ground was selected as a home venue for Minor Counties North in the 1972 Benson & Hedges Cup, where the team played a single List A match against Lancashire. From 1970 to 1988, the ground held one Minor Counties Championship match annually.\n\nCheshire played their first List A match at the venue in the first round of the 1988 NatWest Trophy, which saw them record a famous victory against first-class opponents Northamptonshire. However, Cheshire lost their second round match held at Boughton Hall against Derbyshire. The following season, Cheshire played a further List A match there against Hampshire in the 1989 NatWest Trophy, which ended in defeat.

{"id": "57482751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57482751", "title": "Diceball", "text": "Diceball\n\nDiceball! is a baseball board game where two players roll the dice to face each other on a baseball field. Just like in baseball, there is a visiting team and a home team. Both players use the dice to throw the baseball from the mound to the plate and field the ball on defense. Diceball! was designed to mirror the statistical reality of baseball. A regular game of Diceball! (without extra innings) lasts on average 45 minutes.\n\nThe game was designed on a pizza box by a 16-year old from Rawdon, Québec, Daniel Girard, in 1979, while the Montreal Expos were chasing the pennant in the National League. Daniel Girard brought his game to his High School, where he organized tournaments with other students. Given the popularity of the game in his school, Girard also brought his game to University where it caught fire too. \nThe interest created by the game was noticed by an entrepreneur, Louis Desjardins. Louis Desjardins decided to launch the game alongside Daniel Girard\n\nTo start the game, the visiting team puts a pawn (as a batter and eventually runner) in the batter's box, to get the pitcher's throws. The die replaces the ball. The pitcher rolls the die until 1) the batter is struck out 2) the batter is walked or 3) or the ball is hit. If the ball is hit, the offensive team rolls a die to determine the number of dice to be used to hit the ball.\n\nThe number of dice indicated are rolled and added up. Numbers from 1 to 36 show the location where the ball is hit and the ball is placed on the game board. If the ball is hit on a circle, the ball was hit in the air and an out is recorded. If the ball is hit on a number in a cloud, it means that this is a ground ball and that the batter will have to try to reach a base before the defense throws to that base. If the ball is hit to a star-shaped zone, the runner starts to run around the bases while the defence goes to recover the ball on the star. If the stars are from 27 to 36 it is a homerun and all runners score.\n\nEvery batter who runs around the bases and reaches home plate before three outs score a run. As soon as three outs are recorded, stranded runners are removed from the bases. The teams trade places: the defense becomes the offense.\n\nIn the basic version of Diceball, pawns are used as defensive players and are also used as runners by the opponent. A white pawn is used as a ball. The offense use dice to hit the ball in different spots on the game board and the offensive players try to move the players toward home plate as the defense try to stop the offense by forwarding the ball around.\n\nAn Expert section in the rule book includes more baseball features like the stolen base, the sacrifice bunt and the sacrifice fly.\n\nStrategy plays a role in the game. The ability to decide when to run around the bases or to stop will create momentum or result in outs. Players have the power to try to steal a base, to order a bunt to try to send a runner to second to avoid the double play and/or put a player in a scoring position. A player can also try to advance or score on a sacrifice fly. All these extra plays are subjected to the laws of probability like the rest of the rules of Diceball.\n\nDiceball! got positive reviews upon its launch in the United States and Canada. Games Magazine named it as one of the top Games 100 in the United States in 1991, 1992 and 1993. \nBurt Hochberg, a senior Games magazine editor said in an interview he gave to the Montreal Gazette:\n\nIn January 1994, Diceball was presented in the American International Toy Fair in New York and Daniel Girard, a Diceball inventor, said in an interview to the Montreal Gazette:\n\nThe Unistar Radio Networks of New York (lately Westwood One) described it as the best baseball game on the market:\n\nThe Canadian Toy Testing Council (CTTC), a non-profit agency, that publishes a Toy Report yearly included Diceball in its 1994 report. The game received a three-star rating, the highest score. According to the Montreal Gazette, the game was shipped off to 300 test families in the Ottawa-Hull area for evaluation. Response was excellent across the board, especially from players who liked baseball. Diceball has won the council’s highest accolade, a three-star rating.\nThe game was also reviewed in USA TODAY and got press coverage in Canada's national newspaper, The Globe and Mail, The Toronto Star and The Ottawa Citizen. It was also featured in Quebec in La Presse and Le Journal de Montréal. In Canada, Diceball! had also a lot of television coverage where it was featured on CTV and CBC-Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nBefore it was launched and while it was launched, Diceball! was the center of many tournaments, in schools, colleges and workplaces. Former Expos pitcher Denis Boucher won a Diceball! tournament involving sports reporters in Montreal. After the tournament, Boucher said that you will find in Diceball! all the things that happen in real baseball. He added that playing the game is a great way to spend time with friends. By winning the Diceball! tournament, Denis Boucher was given a $250 cheque that he gave to the Sun Youth Organization.\n\nDiceball! got positive press reviews partly because of its statistical similarities to the actual games of baseball. In Diceball! the batter puts the ball in play 66% of the time compared to 76% in Major League Baseball. The batter is struck out 23% of the time, against 15% in baseball. 11% of the at-bats end up in walks compared to 9% in baseball. The ball is hit a few less times in Diceball! However, the game is balanced out by the greater probability of getting a base hit when the ball is hit (.339 vs. .304).\n\nTaking into accounts strikeouts, the offensive average in Diceball! is almost the same as baseball. .251 versus .254. Since there are more walks and errors in Diceball! than in real baseball, the players on-base percentage is .349 compared to .340 in real baseball. Even the odds of getting an out are realistic. 33.6% of ground balls in Diceball! (34.8% in baseball) 11.7% are flyballs or liners to the infield (14.7% in baseball) and 20.8% are fly balls in the outfield (20.1% in baseball). On average one more runner gets on base from each team in a Diceball! game than in an actual baseball game.\n\nThe more dice you roll on a hit ball, the greater the probability of getting a base hit. With one die, the average is .167; with 2 it is .278; with 3, .287; with 4 dice, it is .356; with 5 dice .351; with 6 dice, your average climbs to .472. The overall average when the ball is hit in play is .319, not counting infield hits. Adding infield hits, the overall average when the ball is hit is .339.\n\nPraised for its statistical accuracy, Diceball! was used in schools in the USA to teach youngsters the virtues of understanding statistics.\n\n"}

During 1986 it was also the home of the short-lived Bristol Bombers American football team.\n\nRovers played their home games at Eastville (nicknamed \"The Ville\") until forced to leave by financial difficulties in 1986. Rovers then spent a decade at Twerton Park in Bath before returning to the city to play at the Memorial Stadium where they remain to this day. The record attendance was 39,462.\n\nBuilt near to a gas holder, the constant smell of town gas in the air gave rise to the name used for Bristol Rovers fans of \"The Gas\" or \"Gasheads\". The nickname \"The Gas\" began as a derogatory nickname used by Bristol City fans, however Rovers fans now refer to themselves as Gasheads as a badge of honour. The number 12 squad shirt has been officially allocated to \"Gasheads\" by the club in honour of the crowd being the 12th man.\n\nAnother unique feature of Eastville was the flower beds behind each goal.\n\nThe Tote End or simply the Tote was a large section of covered terracing behind one of the goals. Originally built in 1935, the Tote End terrace was built following the curve of the greyhound racing track. It had a small covered section in the South-West corner.\n\nThe Totaliser clocks mounted first on the back of the terrace and then after a larger roof was added in 1961 to cover most of the terrace, on the roof fascia, gave it its name.\n\nWith a boisterous and intimidating atmosphere, largely due to it being a favoured spot for the more vociferous Rovers supporters, and given the nature of football in Britain in the 1970s, it became notoriously linked with bovver boys and hooliganism – a period documented by the book \"Bovver\" by Chris Brown.\n\nShortly after Rovers left Eastville in 1986, the Tote End was bulldozed.\n\nRacing started on Saturday June 16, 1928 becoming the second track in Bristol to open after Knowle Stadium. The first ever winner was a greyhound called Vivacious who collected £20 for his connections.\n\nThe totalisator system was introduced in 1932 securing the future of the stadium, this was in contrast to the football club who were in financial difficulties. During 1939 Bristol Rovers F.C negotiated a sale price to the Bristol Greyhound Company, albeit by the chairman, who carried out the deal without the knowledge of his fellow directors. Eastville changed hands for £12,000 and the first General Manager was Lieutenant-Colonel Forsdike who was to become secretary of the National Greyhound Racing Club.\n\nThe Golden Crest competition was introduced in 1937 and became one of the most important races in the provincial calendar. In 1945 Shannon Shore recorded an impressive win by ten lengths in a new track record for 500 yards; the black dog was timed at 28.76secs during the Golden Crest final. A second major competition was introduced in 1946 and this was the Western Two Year Old Produce Stakes.\n\nIn 1947 Oxford Stadium owner Leslie Calcutt was appointed as Director of Bristol Greyhound Racing Association Ltd, a move that would eventually result in Bristol taking over Oxford. The company also acquired Swindon Stadium in 1952 and would be known as Bristol Stadium Ltd following the death of Leslie Calcutt.\n\nEastville became one of the first circuits to abandon grass in 1968, becoming sand based, many tracks would follow suit over the next decade. After selling Oxford Stadium to the council Ian Stevens became General Manager at Eastville in 1975 and in 1980 the track became one of eight tracks to be awarded Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) contracts resulting in a steady income stream. The track suffered a serious fire in August 1980 with the majority of the south stand destroyed causing more than £1 million worth of damage.\n\nWhen trainer Henry Kibble retired his son Terry took over the kennels and provided Eastville with its first English Greyhound Derby finalist in 1991 with Dempsey Duke. The greyhound also won the Blue Riband, East Anglian Derby and Reading Masters.\n\nThe company now known as the BS Group sold Eastville for development, plans were announced for a new Bristol greyhound stadium but never came to fruition. The stadium closed on 27 October 1997 with the entire greyhound operation moving to sister track Swindon. The site became an IKEA superstore.\n\n\nIn 1977 the Newport Wasps speedway team relocated to Bristol as the Bristol Bulldogs and remarkably the speedway track was placed on top of the greyhound circuit and then dug up again every meeting. The speedway only ran for two seasons in the British League before the team withdrew, and speedway has never been run in the city since.\n\n\n"}

The Lady Byng Memorial Trophy has been awarded 88 times to 53 different players since it was first awarded in 1925. The original trophy was donated to the league by Lady Byng of Vimy, then–viceregal consort of Canada.\n\nThe voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10-7-5-3-1 points system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nThe trophy is named in honour of Marie Evelyn Moreton (Lady Byng), wife of Viscount Byng of Vimy, a Vimy Ridge war hero who was Governor General of Canada from 1921 to 1926. Lady Byng, who was an avid hockey fan, decided to donate the trophy to the NHL in 1925.\n\nShe decided the trophy's first winner would be Frank Nighbor of the Ottawa Senators. Late in the season, Lady Byng invited Nighbor to Rideau Hall, showed him the trophy, and asked him if the NHL would accept it as an award for its most gentlemanly player. When Nighbor said he thought it would, Lady Byng, much to Nighbor's surprise, awarded him the trophy.\n\nAfter Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers won the award seven times within eight years, Lady Byng was so impressed that she gave him the original trophy to keep. Lady Byng then donated a second trophy in 1935–36. When Lady Byng died in 1949, the NHL presented another trophy and changed the official name to the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. In 1962, the original trophy was destroyed in a fire at Boucher's home.\n\nBesides Boucher, a number of players have won the award multiple times, including Wayne Gretzky who won it five times, Red Kelly and Pavel Datsyuk with four wins, and Bobby Bauer, Alex Delvecchio, Mike Bossy, Martin St. Louis, and Ron Francis with three each. Because of Boucher's seven wins, the New York Rangers join Detroit as the only two clubs who have won the award fourteen times, followed by Toronto with nine wins, Chicago and Boston tied with eight, and Los Angeles with six. Adam Oates was a six-time finalist for the Lady Byng Trophy but never won.\n\nFive players have won both the Lady Byng Trophy and the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP in the same season: Buddy O'Connor (1947–48), Bobby Hull (1964–65), Stan Mikita (1966–67 and 1967–68), Wayne Gretzky (1979–80) and Joe Sakic (2000–01). Mikita is also the only player to win the Hart, Art Ross, and Lady Byng trophies in the same season, doing so consecutively in the 1966–67 and 1967–68 seasons. Gretzky, Bobby Hull, and Martin St. Louis also won these three awards, but not in the same season. Bobby and Brett Hull are the only father-son combination to win the Hart and Lady Byng trophies.\n\nBill Quackenbush, Red Kelly, and Brian Campbell are the only defensemen to have won the Lady Byng Trophy, with Kelly being the only one to win it multiple times (3 as a defenseman, 4 overall). After Kelly, no defenseman won the award for a 58-year stretch which ended in 2012 when Campbell received the honor, though Nicklas Lidstrom narrowly lost to Joe Sakic in 2001. No goaltender has ever won the award.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6780323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6780323", "title": "Red Bull X-Fighters", "text": "Red Bull X-Fighters\n\nRed Bull X-Fighters is a freestyle motocross motorbike stunt competition, contested in bullrings and famous locations and sites. Created back in 2001, Red Bull X-Fighters is the most popular freestyle motocross event in the world with a 15-year plus history and more than 50 past events on six continents. The riders are invited to compete head-to-head through a series of knockout rounds in front of some of the world's most iconic locations.\n\nX-Fighters was founded in 2001, and became the most famous freestyle motocross event series in the world. The Plaza de Toros de Valencia in Spain was where it began, being the first venue to host the competition. A 12,000 crowd was recorded, with American 'Mad' Mike Jones taking out the inaugural event, and the host nations very own Edgar Torronteras coming second and French rider, Xavier Fabre coming third respectively. After the impact made in 2001, Red Bull X-Fighters returned for a second time. Moving from the bullring in Valencia to Madrid's Las Ventas. The crowd had almost doubled in size from the previous year, with the arena to a full capacity of nearly 20,000. It was another close series of head-to-heads between riders like Mike Metzger and the previous year's champion, Mike Jones. But it was Spain's Edgar Torronteras, that won the event and took the trophy that season. Firmly securing X-Fighters foothold as one of the major events in FMX history and Europe's biggest FMX event.\n2003 was to bring about some major developments to the event. It introduced the line up of events to increase from one to two that year with both Valencia and Madrid staging competitions in their bullrings. But Red Bull X-Fighters and the entire sport of FMX witnessed one of its first major tricks. At Las Ventas in Madrid, a new rider to the competition, the 18-year-old from Phoenix, Arizona, Nate Adams created freestyle world of motocross history after performing the first ever back flip at the event.\n\nThe riders then returned to compete in the bullring of Madrid for the only X-Fighters event of 2004. Having a major impact on the pace of progression in the sport that year that the back flip had gone from what most people didn't think was possible to an almost standard feature in most riders runs. Riders were not only performing back flips with ease, they were laying down back flip combinations. Joining the event was a new face on the Red Bull X-Fighters scene, the well-known Travis Pastrana. It saw him and Adams stage the first of their head-to-head battles, going all in a battle against each other and pulling off spectacular 360's in front of huge crowds. Pastrana took first and Adams second. Ronnie Renner did his first competitive backflip in Madrid that year. The following year, after continuous success in Spain, X-Fighters staged its first event outside of Europe. Bringing the riders in FMX to compete at the biggest bullring on the planet, the Plaza de Toros México in Mexico City. The growing popularity of the sport was proved by the capacity crowd of over 40,000 fans. Once again the riders proved why FMX was becoming one of the most incredible spectator sports in the world by putting on another massive watched competition that was eventually won by Ronnie Renner. After Mexico, Madrid hosted yet another event, which Nate Adams won. Lastly, in 2006, Mexico City and Madrid were to repeat the following year and host the last two events before the World Tour format began.\n\nIn 2007, X-Fighters was becoming a global phenomenon. But the year had a special significance as X-Fighters moved from the exclusive bullring locations into new inspirational arenas. It reached double figures, celebrating its tenth competition in Mexico City. But it was the next stop that was a new direction for the event. Instead of the bullrings that housed every event so far, Red Bull X-Fighters instead built a very different course. Against a backdrop of historic Slane Castle in Ireland. This stunning setting had previously played host to the likes of the Rolling Stones, Madonna, and Guns N' Roses. Although the conditions were wet as rain fell heavily in Slane Castle, dampening most riders ability to really take on the course. But there was one rider that refused to be compromised and displayed the pure pioneer spirit, coming first in the event, Travis Pastrana. After Ireland, the newly world tour ended and rounded off in a return to Madrid. Pastrana again proving he was one of the greatest riders after he rode to yet his second consecutive win that season.\n2008 will always be remembered amongst FMX fans as the year Red Bull X-Fighters truly became a fully fledged international tour. That was the year it went global. Expanding its line up of stops from three in 2007 to six. Taking in Mexico, making its first visit to South America with a trip to the Sambadrome in Rio de Janeiro before coming north of the border to Texas. Then across the Atlantic to the European legs of Spain, Germany and Poland. After Mat Rebeaud's devastating dominance in 2008, the international line-up of riders were competitive and much different as event nineteen marked the start of the 2009 season and a fresh new face joined the line up of riders competing in the monumental Plaza de Toros México. A 17-year-old from New Zealand, Levi Sherwood. As soon as he came out into that arena it soon became clear that he had something that would set the sport a light. His superb debut showing resulted in a worthy win and set the tone for what was going to continue to be a landmark season. After a closely fought contest in Calgary, Canada, the tour rode into Texas. The course built in Fort Worth for the twenty-first Red Bull X-Fighters certainly was known as one of their biggest courses created. With new tricks being performed, Cam Sinclair introduced the double back flip. He successfully pulled it off, being the first rider to do so in a competition run. Moving on to the next event in Madrid, Sinclair again attempted the double back flip but this time got it horribly wrong. He suffered severe head injuries, a ruptured liver, extensive internal bleeding, a broken shoulder and cheekbone, also had brain swelling causing him to be in a coma for seven days. With Sinclair in recovery, the 2009 tour ended with Red Bull X-Fighters twenty-third event and a first for London with a spectacular finale at the iconic Battersea Power Station.\nIn 2010 Red Bull X-Fighters were granted permission to stage an event in Moscow's Red Square right beside the Kremlin, using it as their backdrop. Not only that, they were also given permission to base an event at the Giza Plateau in Egypt with the Great Sphinx of Giza in the background. Red Bull X-Fighters then marked past in its quarter century with another return to its long serving Madrid. Australian Robbie Maddison had a special surprise in store for the Spanish fans pulling off a body varial. A first ever seen trick in the competition, Maddison went on to win the event but it was to be his downfall as he prepared for the following event in London. He bailed in an attempt at the volt badly, ending his season. After the UK stop, X-Fighters wrapped up its twenty-ninth event by rounding off the 2010 tour in Italy where Nate Adams achieved another first to add to his Red Bull X-Fighters career. Being the first rider to claim a second tile for a second consecutive year.\n\n2011 saw Red Bull X-Fighters reach its 10th year anniversary and stadiums and arenas across the world were selling out to a huge international fan base. It brought up its 30th event on Jumeirah Beach in Dubai. The tour then encountered a spectacular show when it staged round two of the championship in front of the Monumental Axis in the Brazil capital, Brasilia. In front of a crowd with over 100,000 people, was the biggest FMX attended event in the history of the sport. Following the events in Rome, Madrid, and Poznań, the tour ended in a grand finale on Cockatoo Island in the heart of Sydney Harbour, Australia. Making the most of competing in front of his home crowd for the first time was Australia's Josh Sheehan. He surprised everyone by pulling off the last win of 2011. But the tour title that year belonged to someone else, Dany Torres. In 2012 the Red Bull X-Fighters tour took a huge leap forward. It started in Dubai with a course that included the biggest jump distance ever built in a competitive freestyle course but the next event was a giant leap of FMX kind. In Glen Helen, Red Bull created the biggest course ever constructed. After the huge course the tour moved to Europe in Madrid where New Zealander Levi Sherwood took a stunning victory and extended his lead in the overall standings. Next up was Munich's Olympic Stadium which became the stage of a night of huge drama and significance in the freestyle world. The leading man was Tom Pagès. The tour was set for another close finale once again on Cockatoo Island in Australia. It saw Jackson Strong perform X-Fighters first front flip and did it again one handed. But it came down to the overall current first and second place riders to meet in the final for a chance to win the World Tour title. It was Sherwood whom bet Pagès after he performed the huge tricks and style when it really mattered to take the 2012 title.\n\nAfter eight spectacular years of the Red Bull X-Fighters World Tour, 2016 concentrated on one season highlight event at the legendary Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas in Madrid on June 24. The Red Bull X-Fighters stop in Madrid marked the 15th straight year that the famous bullring hosted the event of Freestyle Motocross, where the world's best riders have been showcasing new and exciting tricks since 2002. France's Tom Pagès became the first rider in history to win Madrid three consecutive times with his stirring victory in 2015 in front of another sold-out house of 23,000 spectators. Travis Pastrana of the USA had also won Madrid three times but not consecutively while Spanish rider Dany Torres had won the most important stop of the season twice.\n\nIt was Tom Pagès who carved his name into the record books with a spectacular fourth straight Red Bull X-Fighters win in Madrid, the spiritual home of freestyle motocross that celebrated its 15th anniversary in style in front of a full house. At the Las Ventas bullring Pagès treated the crowd to his new Front Flip Flair, the first time ever the trick was performed in competition. In an epic three-way battle featuring the world's best FMX riders, Clinton Moore, the 2015 World Tour champion, came in a close second after a flawless run in the final with his Bundy jump recorded to be 14 meters high by a new Intel high-tech device. Josh Sheehan had to settle for third despite nailing his signature double back flip. Levi Sherwood of New Zealand finished fourth on an unforgettable night at the FMX extravaganza in the Spanish capital.\n\nEach day of every event, riders get opportunities to train. Day one starts off with a briefing. Day two is qualification and day three is competition. In qualification, there is one 90-second qualifying run. All twelve riders ride in their start order. Any rider who misses a qualifying session will be scored in the last place position. Should more than one rider miss the qualifying session then previous year's Tour rank will determine placing, with the lowest ranked rider being scored as the last place. Should no Tour rank exists, and then a draw will take place to establish rank for the purpose of qualifying. The results of the qualification will define the three groups of four riders that will compete in the Cuadrillas Elimination.\n\nThe Cuadrillas Elimination is where each group of four riders will spin a roulette of tricks one time (old-school tricks that are barely shown in competition). All riders have to pull out this trick within their 50-second run. The best two riders of each group qualify for the semi-final. At the completion of each rider's run, the judges award a score. When all riders in this round have completed a scored run, the scores are announced and the top scored rider advances through to the semi-final. Six riders are then qualified in pairs and battle head-to-head in the semi-final, in which there is no mandatory trick. Each rider takes his own run with a pre-determined time limit (75 seconds). The lower seeded rider in each pair ride first. Time starts when the rider takes his first jump. After each run, the rider goes a pre-designated position to watch his replays on the big screen. The second rider in the pair, who is not riding, will wait at the Hot Spot, remove his helmet and watch the other rider's run. After the second rider's run, both wait at a pre-designated position for the judges' decision of whom of the two is in the Final round. The winner from each battle would advance to the final.\n\nThe final consists of three winners from the semi-final that meet in a head-to-head run-off. Each rider takes his own run with a pre-determined time limit (75 seconds). The rider from the semi-final A will ride first followed by the winner of the semi-final B and C. Time will start when the rider takes his first jump. After the 75 seconds each rider can perform a Bonus Trick which is not affected by the time limit. After each run, the rider goes a pre-designated position to watch his replay on the big screen. The second and third riders, who are not riding, will wait at the Hot Spot, remove their helmet and watch the other rider's run. After the third rider's run, all three wait at a pre-designated position for the judges' decision of whom of the three will be celebrated as the winner of the Red Bull X-Fighters competition. Overall the riders can win five helmets. If there is a tie (e.g. two riders win two helmets and one rider 1 helmet) the Bonus Tricks decides on the winner.\n\nJudging in all rounds consist of five judges, each one judging the overall impression based on the following criteria:\n\nThere are two separate judging systems for the Red Bull X-Fighters competition. Round one judging panel comprises five judges, plus one Head Judge. These judges will award each rider a score from 1-100 points. Final score will be represented as a number from 0–100 based on an average of all five judges' scores (From a total of 0 - 500 ÷ 5 judges) In the semi-finals and final, each judge award each of the riders in the heat a score on a scale of 1–100 points. The rider with the highest score from a single judge will win that judge's vote. The rider who gets three or more judges' votes out of five will win the match-up. The Head Judge is solely responsible for indicating when time expires on a run. If, in the mind of the Head Judge, a rider is considered to be 'on approach' to a jump when the time clock reaches zero, then that jump (or series of jumps in a double-double or 6-pack) will count in the rider's final score. The Head Judge will also have the ability to change any single score or group of scores and makes the final decision in any tiebreaker situations. Should two or more riders in Round one have a scoring tie out of 100 points, then the high and low scores for each rider will be eliminated and the remaining three scores averaged to give a score of 100 points. Should this method still result in a tie then the highest single score will break the tie(s). In the event that none of these methods breaks the tie(s) then the Head Judge will break the tie(s)\n\nOverall there has been 25 different locations that have hosted an X-Fighters event. Below shows a list of former and current venues, along with their location and number of times taken part.\n\nDany Torres of Spain is the all-time top points holder on the World Tour, with 7 wins and 1 title. Torres also holds the following records; Most starts, Most head to heads, Most head to heads won, Most head to heads lost, Most quarterfinals, Most semi-finals, Most top three appearances and, Most World Tour top three appearances. He is the most successful rider to hold a total of 9 X-Fighters records. New Zealander Levi Sherwood holds two (Most finals and Most wins), with Nate Adams and Mat Rebeaud both holding one each.\n\nIn all, 86 top riders have competed in at least one X-Fighters event. Of these, eight riders have won the World Tour. With two titles, American Nate Adams is the most successful World Tour rider. Adams (2009 and 2010) is also the only rider to have won two consecutive titles.\n\n\nRed Bull X-Fighters released their very own \"Wall of Fame\" in a video about the history of the competition. There also is a \"Hall of Fame\". There are only 9 Freestyle Motocross riders in the sport's most exclusive club. It is reserved only to the winners of Madrid, the most important FMX stop each year since the inaugural event in 2002. The Hall of Fame in Madrid features plaques hanging on the walls with the names, Spanish nicknames, and portraits of each year's winner, framed in the style of famous bullfighters who have also graced the grounds of the Las Ventas bullring. The Hall of Fame starts with Edgar Torronteras (2002, 'E.T'), Kenny Bartram (2003, 'El Cowboy'), Travis Pastrana (2004/06/07, 'El Prodigioso'), Nate Adams (2005, 'El Destroyer'), Mat Rebeaud (2008, 'Air Mat'), Dany Torres (2009/11, 'El Pajarillo'), Robbie Maddison (2010, 'Mad Dog'), Levi Sherwood (2012/17 'El Chico de Goma') and Thomas Pagès (2013/14/15/16, 'Mr Flair').\n\n"}

On his/her turn, the player tries to get at least one of his/her balls closest to the jack. There are two ways to get one's ball closest to the jack: try to throw one's ball close enough in the first place, or try to knock an opponent's ball or the jack off with one's own ball. A popular tactic is to use one ball to knock an opponent's ball off and the other to get closest to the jack. If a player doesn't get even one of his balls closest to the jack on his/her turn, he/she drops out of the game. The game continues until only one player remains.\n\nTaistelupetankki players describe the game as \"continuing where pétanque left off\".\n\n\nOne of the players, usually the winner of the last game or the youngest player, throws the jack to a place he/she deems worthy. After this, a combination shot happens, where every player throws both of their balls, one at a time, onto the playing field, every player at the same time. It is recommended to watch where the balls land.\n\nThe first proper throwing round is started by the player who has either of his/her balls the furthest away from the jack. Both balls are thrown, one at a time, towards the jack so that at least one of them ends up closest to the jack. If the player fails to do this on his/her turn, he/she drops out of the game.\n\nThe next throwing turn is for the player who has either of his/her balls the furthest away from the jack. This continues until all players have thrown their balls, and this order of throwing continues for the following rounds.\n\nThe player picks his/her ball up from the ground from between his/her feet and throws it where he/she stands. Contrary to normal pétanque, it is allowed to jump during the throw, provided that the player lands on the same spot where he/she started from. The ball must travel in the air at least 10 cm.\n\nThe game can last from five minutes to an hour, depending on the circumstances (skill, terrain conditions, weather, number of successful knocks, the players' mental state...)\n\nThe players act as judges themselves, in order to reach a consensus should controversial situations arise.\n\nThe Finnish Taistelupetankki Association holds competitions open to everyone. There are competitions all year round, mostly based on the capital region. Also individual competitions are held annually at least in Tampere and Tallinn.\n\n"}
