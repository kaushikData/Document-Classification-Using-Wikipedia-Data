The most credible hypothesis talks about how pilgrims brought this tradition thanks to the Camino de Santiago.\n\nBowling is important in Asturian culture as it is mentioned in the Regional mythology, for example with the golden bowls of the xanes.\n\nThe first reference of Asturian bowling, one of the oldest in Spain, dates back to 1495. Alonso de Quintanilla, major book-keeper of the Catholic Monarchs, complains Nuno Bernaldo de Quirós of ruining the coat of arms during a bowling game at \"Campo de San Francisco\" in Oviedo. Thanks to this document, it is known that the pins were called \"byrlos\" and that betting was usual during the games.\n\nIn the 18th century, according to Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, \"in most villages and places of Asturias there's a bowling alley, a place where neighbors meet and play.\" During the 19th century and the early 20th, the Asturian bowling became the most widespread activity in the rural zones of the Region.\n\nAsturian bowling popularity grows during the 20th century with the creation of a Federation, that was dissolved during the Spanish Civil War. When it finished, competitions were reorganized and the Asturian Federation of Bowling was reestablished in 1962.\n\nNowadays, due to the rural emigration, some bowling variations fell into disuse. Despite the emigration, the rise of interest in traditional culture is helping to keep the game, specially in the most played variations like \"cuatreada\", \"birle\" or \"bolo celta\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "62398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62398", "title": "Belmont Stakes", "text": "Belmont Stakes\n\nThe Belmont Stakes is an American Grade I stakes Thoroughbred horse race held on the first or second Saturday in June at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. It is a horse race, open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds. Colts and geldings carry a weight of ; fillies carry . The race, nicknamed The Test of the Champion, and The Run for the Carnations, is the third and final leg of the Triple Crown and is held five weeks after the Kentucky Derby and three weeks after the Preakness Stakes. The 1973 Belmont Stakes and Triple Crown winner Secretariat holds the mile and a half stakes record (which is also a track and world record on dirt) of 2:24.\n\nThe attendance at the Belmont Stakes is among the American thoroughbred racing top-attended events. The 2004 Belmont Stakes drew a television audience of 21.9 million viewers, and had the highest household viewing rate since 1977 when Seattle Slew won the Triple Crown.\n\nThe 150th Belmont Stakes took place on Saturday, June 9, 2018. Justify won the race and became the second horse in four years to win the Triple Crown.\n\nThe first Belmont Stakes was held at Jerome Park Racetrack in The Bronx, built in 1866 by stock market speculator Leonard Jerome (1817–1891) and financed by August Belmont Sr. (1816–1890), for whom the race was named. The first race in 1867 saw the filly Ruthless win, while the following year was won by General Duke. The race continued to be held at Jerome Park until 1890, when it was moved to the nearby facility, Morris Park Racecourse. The 1895 race was almost not held because of new laws that banned bookmaking in New York: it was eventually rescheduled for November 2. The race remained at Morris Park Racecourse until the May 1905 opening of the new Belmont Park, racetrack in Elmont, New York on Long Island, just outside the New York City borough of Queens. When anti-gambling legislation was passed in New York State, Belmont Racetrack was closed, and the race was cancelled in 1911 and 1912.\n\nThe first winner of the Triple Crown was Sir Barton, in 1919, before the series was recognized as such. In 1920, the Belmont was won by the great Man o' War, who won by 20 lengths, setting a new stakes and American record.\n\nStarting in 1926, the winner of the Belmont Stakes has been presented with August Belmont Trophy. The owner may keep the trophy for one year, and also receives a silver miniature for permanent use.\n\nThe term Triple Crown was first used when Gallant Fox won the three races in 1930, but the term did not enter widespread use until 1935 when his son Omaha repeated the feat. Sir Barton was then honored retroactively. Since 1931, the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes, and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1931, the Preakness was run before the Derby eleven times. On May 12, 1917 and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day. On eleven occasions, the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes. The date of each event is now set by the Kentucky Derby, which is always held on the first Saturday in May. The Preakness Stakes is currently held two weeks later; and the Belmont Stakes is held three weeks after the Preakness (five weeks after the Derby). The earliest possible date for the Derby is May 1, and the latest is May 7; the earliest possible date for the Belmont is thus June 5, and the latest is June 11.\nIn 1937, War Admiral became the fourth Triple Crown winner after winning the Belmont in a new track record time of 2:28 3/5. In the 1940s, four Triple Crown winners followed: Whirlaway in 1941, Count Fleet in 1943, Assault in 1946 and Citation in 1948. Count Fleet won the race by a then-record margin of twenty-five lengths. He also set a stakes record of 2:28 1/5, a record tied by Citation. In 1957, the stakes record was smashed when Gallant Man ran the Belmont in 2:26 3/5 in a year when the Triple Crown series was split three ways.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes race was held at Aqueduct Racetrack from 1963 to 1967, while the track at Belmont was restored and renovated.\n\nThe largest crowd of the 20th century was in 1971 with over 80,000 people, supplemented by the city's Latino community, there to cheer on their new hero, Cañonero II, the Venezuelan colt who had won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and was poised to win the U.S. Triple Crown. However, due to a foot infection that had bothered the horse for several days, Cañonero II failed to win the Triple Crown when he struggled across the finish line in 4th place behind Pass Catcher, ridden by Walter Blum. Despite this loss, Cañonero II was named the winner of the first Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse.\n\nOn June 9, 1973, Secretariat won the Belmont Stakes by thirty-one lengths in a record time of 2:24, becoming a Triple Crown champion, ending a 25-year gap between Citation, the Belmont and Triple Crown winner in 1948. Secretariat's record still stands as the fastest running of the Belmont Stakes and an American record for 1½ miles on the dirt. In 1977, Seattle Slew became the first horse to win the Triple Crown while undefeated. Affirmed was the last winner of the Triple Crown in the 20th century, taking the Belmont Stakes in 2:26 4/5 on June 10, 1978. Ridden by eighteen-year-old Steve Cauthen, Affirmed defeated rival Alydar with Jorge Velasquez in the saddle. At the time the race was the third-slowest start and the third-fastest finish with the quarter in 25, the half in 50, 3/4 in 1:14, the mile in 1:37 2/5.\n\nIn 1988, Secretariat's son Risen Star won the Belmont in 2:26 2/5, then the second-fastest time in the history of the race. The next year, Easy Goer lowered the mark for second-fastest time to 2:26. Easy Goer also holds a Beyer Speed Figure of 122 for the race, the best of any Triple Crown race since these ratings were first published in 1987.\n\nFor three years in a row, horses came to the Belmont Stakes with a Triple Crown on the line only to fail. In 2002, Belmont Park hosted what was then the largest crowd in its history when 103,222 saw War Emblem lose to longshot Sarava after stumbling at the start. In 2003, 101,864 watched Funny Cide finish third behind Empire Maker. In 2004, the attendance record was shattered when 120,139 people saw Smarty Jones upset by Birdstone.\n\nIn 2007, Rags to Riches became the first filly to win the race since Tanya in 1905. Three more failed Triple Crown bids followed: in 2008, Big Brown lost to Da' Tara; in 2012, I'll Have Another was withdrawn due to injury; and in 2014, California Chrome was beaten by Tonalist. This fueled debate about whether the series needed to be changed, for example by lengthening the period between races.\n\nAmerican Pharoah won the 2015 race, becoming the 12th horse in history to win the Triple Crown and the first in 37 years. The crowd that year was limited for the first time, to 90,000. His time of 2:26.65 was the sixth-fastest in Belmont Stakes history, and the second-fastest time for a Triple Crown winner. In 2018, Justify became the 13th Triple Crown winner and only the second horse to do so while undefeated.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes has been run at a mile and a half since 1926, having been run at that distance in 1874–1889.\n\nThe race has also been run at the following distances: a mile and five furlongs in 1867–1873; a mile and a quarter in 1890–1892, 1895, and 1904–1905; a mile and a furlong in 1893–1894; and a mile and three furlongs from 1896–1903 and 1906–1925.\n\nThe purse for the first running in 1867 was $1,500 added, meaning the purse was supplemented by nomination and entry fees. This made the total purse $2,500, with the winner receiving $1,850. The purse increased sharply in the Roaring Twenties, from Man O'War's earnings of $7,950 in 1920 to Gallant Fox's take of $66,040 in 1930. Purses declined as a result of the Great Depression, with War Admiral earning only $28,020 in 1937, then began to recover. Throughout the sixties and early seventies, the value to the winner was roughly $100,000, depending on the added money generated by entry fees (larger fields thus leading to higher prize money). The purse was repeatedly raised in the eighties and nineties, reaching $500,000 added, with the winner receiving roughly $400,000. In 1998, the purse was changed to $1,000,000 guaranteed, with the winner receiving $600,000. In 2014, the purse was raised to $1,500,000.\n\nWith one exception, the race has been run at a level weight of 126 pounds (with a 5-pound allowance for fillies) since 1900. The 126 pounds comes from the English Classics, where the standard weight is 9 stone, with one stone equaling 14 pounds. In 1913, the Belmont was run as a handicap with the winner carrying only 109 pounds compared to the runner-up carrying 126 pounds. Races run prior to 1900 had varied weight conditions.\n\nThe first post parade in the United States was at the 14th Belmont, in 1880. Before 1921, the race was run in the clockwise tradition of English racing. Since then, the race has been run in the American, or counter-clockwise, direction. Because of its length (one lap around the enormous Belmont main track), and because it is the final race of the Triple Crown, it is called the \"Test of the Champion\". Most three-year-olds are unaccustomed to the distance, and lack the experience, if not the stamina, to maintain a winning speed for so long. In a long race such as the Belmont, positioning of the horse and the timing of the move to chase for the lead can be critical.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes is traditionally called \"The Test of the Champion\" because of its 1.5 mile length—by far the longest of the three Triple Crown races, and one of the longest for a first-class race in the United States on the dirt. It is also known as \"The Run for the Carnations\" because the winning horse is draped with a blanket of white carnations after the race, in similar fashion to the blanket of roses and black-eyed Susans for the Derby and Preakness, respectively. The winning owner is ceremonially presented with the silver winner's trophy, designed by Paulding Farnham for Tiffany and Co. It was first presented to August Belmont Jr. in 1896 and donated by the Belmont family for annual presentation in 1926.\n\nDespite the fact that the Belmont Stakes is the oldest of the Triple Crown races, its traditions have been more subject to change. Until 1996, the post parade song was \"The Sidewalks of New York\". From 1997 to 2009, the song was changed to broadcast a recording by Frank Sinatra of the \"Theme from New York, New York\" in an attempt to appeal to younger fans. In 2010, the song was changed to Jay-Z's \"Empire State of Mind\" sung by Jasmine V before reverting to \"Theme from \"New York, New York\"\" from 2011 through the present. This tradition is similar to the singing of the state song at the post parades of the first two Triple Crown races: \"My Old Kentucky Home\" at the Kentucky Derby and \"Maryland, My Maryland\" at the Preakness Stakes. The change of song gave rise to \"the myth of Mamie O'Rourke,\" a reference to a character in the lyrics of \"The Sidewalks of New York.\" Before American Pharoah won the Triple Crown in 2015, some claimed that changing the official Belmont song \"cursed\" the Triple Crown and was why no horse had won since Affirmed in 1978. Others note that there was no Triple Crown winner between 1979 and 1996, even though \"Sidewalks\" was still played.\n\nAlong with the change of song in 1997, the official drink was also changed, from the \"White Carnation\" to the \"Belmont Breeze.\" \"The New York Times\" reviewed both cocktails unfavorably, calling the Belmont Breeze \"a significant improvement over the nigh undrinkable White Carnation\" despite the fact that it \"tastes like a refined trashcan punch.\" In 2011, the Belmont Breeze was again changed to the current official drink known as the \"Belmont Jewel.\"\n\nWhile the origin of the white carnation as the official flower of the Belmont Stakes is unknown, traditionally, pure white carnations stand for love and luck. It takes approximately 700 \"select\" carnations imported from Colombia to create the 40-pound blanket draped over the winner of the Belmont Stakes. The NYRA has long used The Pennock Company, a wholesale florist based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to import the carnations used for the mantle.\n\nFrom 1986 until 2005, the Triple Crown television rights comprised a single package. In late 2004, the New York Racing Association withdrew from that agreement to negotiate independently. As a result of this NBC, who was the rights holder for all three events, was only able to keep its broadcast rights to the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. ABC regained the rights to the Belmont Stakes as part of a five-year contract that expired following the 2010 race; NBC has since regained the rights to the race through 2020.\n\nSpeed record:\n\nMargin of Victory:\n\nMost wins by a jockey:\n\nMost wins by a trainer:\n\nMost wins by an owner:\n\n\nOnly 23 fillies have run in the Belmont; three of which have won:\n\nThis gives them a respectable 13% win rate when entered. For context, three fillies have won the Kentucky Derby while five have won the Preakness Stakes. On average, fillies have won between 2% and 3% of the Triple Crown races, with similar numbers for geldings; while about 95% of these races have been won by colts. The last filly as of November 2017 to run in the Belmont was in 2013 when Unlimited Budget ran six behind the winner Palace Malice.\n\n\nA † designates a Triple Crown Winner.A ‡ designates a filly.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1334658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1334658", "title": "Boardshorts", "text": "Boardshorts\n\nBoardshorts are a type of swimwear and casual wear in the form of relatively long (approximately knee length) loose-fitting shorts that are designed to be quick-drying and are generally made from strong and smooth polyester or nylon material. Originally known as surf trunks, later as Jams, and occasionally in British English as swim shorts, boardshorts are a style of men's and, more recently, women's summerwear.\n\nBoardshorts have evolved over the last 50 years and separated themselves from the simpler swim trunks category from which they originated. In the beginning of their history, change happened organically – individual solutions were born out of the need to address environmental requirements and inadequacies in a garment that was increasingly used specifically for surfing. Although they are now considered a popular form of general beachwear, much of today's mass consumer acceptance is based on competing brands marketing themselves as being authentic due to their historical roots within the surfing lifestyle and their product's technical authority. \n\nThe name \"boardshorts\" is based on their use in aquatic sports that use a board, such as surfing. They are also sometimes called \"boardies\" in slang, especially in Australia, and \"baggies\" in South Africa.\n\nBoardshorts are especially popular in North America and spread beyond surfing especially as the skater punk fashion trend got underway. They are also typically worn in men's beach volleyball. They are less popular in other parts of the world, where other suit styles are preferred.\n\nBoardshorts are designed to be quick-drying, and are generally made from strong and smooth polyester or nylon material. They are durable and hold up to wear from contact with a surfboard, yet are comfortable and light-weight. They are well-adapted to use in various active watersports.\n\nBoardshorts do not have an elastic waist like many swim shorts do; instead they have a more rigid waistband which opens at the front, often with a velcro fly. The waistband is also held together at the front with a lace-up tie. This double fail-safe system is in order to ensure that the shorts cannot be pulled off the body by the force of the wave when a surfer is tumbled under water during a wipeout. Another common feature of authentic surfing boardshort design is a very small pocket sealed with velcro and vented with a grommet. This is designed to be a secure place to carry a car key, house key, or hotel key card while in the water. Boardshorts traditionally have no lining, unlike traditional swim shorts.\n\nBoardshorts are normally longer than many shorts or form-fitting speedo styles of swimwear, and often (other than the waist) they have a loose or baggy appearance. The major reason for the extra length is to protect the wearer's legs from wax on the board. Surfboards are covered with a layer of sticky wax, which allows the surfer to stand on the board without slipping off. However, this wax can rip leg hair off a surfer when sitting on the board waiting for waves. Long boardshorts cover the back of the leg when sitting on the board, preventing the wax from ripping out the leg hair. The length of boardshorts is also affected by fashion trends; the length can range from mid-thigh (old school) to below the knee, covering the entire knee. In the 2000s, boardshorts were often worn low in the back, exposing the top of the buttocks. Many designs of board shorts use vibrant color, striking patterns including Hawaiian floral images, and highlighted stitching; however not all boardshorts have these features.\n\nAlthough the basic design for boardshorts remains largely the same, some manufacturers have taken advantage of new technology. Because surfers and other water-sports enthusiasts commonly wear boardshorts without underwear, one of the major complaints has been about the use of velcro for the fly closure which tends to entangle pubic hair. A solution that some manufactures have come up with is to use a neoprene fly, which does not allow the fly to completely open, but provides enough stretch so that the shorts can be easily pulled on and off. Pubic hair does not get caught on the neoprene fly. To remedy another common complaint, about boardshorts stitching in the inseam area which would rub directly against the wearer's skin, many manufacturers switched to a seamless design, or use welding or glue, rather than stitches. Although it is very common for boardshorts to be worn without underwear, some male wearers prefer to wear compression shorts, boxers, a jockstrap or briefs under them. Some female surfers wear a swimsuit or bikini bottom under boardshorts.\n\nSome style of Mixed Martial Arts shorts were developed from boardshorts. Men's physique class in the National Physique Committee also uses boardshorts for onstage competition.\n\nAlmost all swimsuit manufacturers and many designer brands now produce boardshorts. There are even boardshort-specific retailers, which offer an assortment of boardshorts to the surfing and wakeboarding public.\n"}
{"id": "16338120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16338120", "title": "British Universities Snowsports Council", "text": "British Universities Snowsports Council\n\nThe BUSC or British Universities Snowsports Council was active between 1990–2014 with the motto 'Run by students, for students', its sole aim was to promote and increase participation and competition in skiing and snowboarding at all levels for students in the United Kingdom, it was a unique students sporting organisation as it was run by students for students. An annual vote would be held in November at BUDS to elect a new committee, who would commence running BUSC and upholding the BUSC constitution from the following April for one year. In 2014 Wasteland Ski took over running over the event, ending the student led era.\n\nThe main role of BUSC as an organisation was to run events for student snowsports and it was the only BUCS (British Universities Sports Association) recognised organiser of snowsports competitions at the time.\n\nThe BUSC year included races, freestyle competitions, demo days, parties and culminate at The Main Event. This was a two-week event with competitions, ski and snowboard lessons, freestyle exhibitions and night time entertainment.\n\nBritish University Snowsports Championships began over 80 years ago and was set up by Oxford and Cambridge. Originally a Ski Championships (Slalom and Giant Slalom only), they were held annually in the Cairngorm mountains.\n\nIn 1977 two students of English universities, Kareem Gangee of UCL and Anthony Peters of the University of Manchester agreed, during the BUSF championships at Aviemore, that it would be easier and better for English university teams to travel by package tour to France to ski than it was to haul by minibus to Scotland and that the snow conditions would be more reliable. They agreed to try to arrange an English university chamopship event for the pre-Christmas week. Oxford and Cambridge were invited to join but opted to stick with their annual Crystal Cup competition in St Moritz in Switzerland which was held during the same period.\n\nThey approached UAU, the governing body of English university sports, with the idea but it was rejected due to a rule which stated that if a sport could be carried out on the British Isles, it had to be. This defeated the object. The two students agreed therefore to disafiliate skiing from UAU and formed EUSC, the English University Ski Council, and arranged a first championship in Les Arcs in France in December 1979. The championship was won by Manchester who, according to the rules, became responsible for organising the following year's event. \n\nAt the captains' meeting at the close of this week the representative of Bangor university requested that they, as a Welsh team, should be included and the first collective decision taken by the captains' committee was to rename the body English and Welsh Universities Ski Council, EWUSC\n\nPrior to 1991 the BUSF (British University Sports Federation (1962–1994)) Championships had been held during Easter vacation in Scotland. Also held annually were the SUSF (Scottish University Sports Federation (?–2005)) Championships in Scotland and the EWUSC races (1979 –1992) during the first week of the Christmas holidays in the Alps\n\nDue to technical issues at the event in academic year 1989–90 the decision was made to move the event to the Alps, Kings Ski Club provided the organisation for first BUSF Championships to be held abroad. Unfortunately the event was not to the expected standards due to the Tour Op, which resulted in no BUSF championships being held the following year.\n\nThe organisers of the EWUSC Championships decided to invite the Scottish Universities to their event and to form BUSC (British University Ski Championships). The first BUSC Championships were held in 1993 in the French resort of Les Menuires. In 2005, after 3 successful years working with Wasteland Ski, the BUSC committee signed a 25 year contract expiring on 1st June 2029 in which Wasteland would create an sister company called ETC (Events Travel Company), which would share 50% of profits with BUSC, and remain separate from Wasteland Ski management.\n\nIn 2010, with the creation of BUSC Events, the contract was resigned to continue on, unfortunately from 2011 onwards Wasteland took increasingly aggressive steps to manage ETC and BUSC. In 2011, Wasteland took over the BUSC Captains Trip, simply rebranding it as the Wasteland Captains Trip. From 2012 Wasteland ski not only failed to fulfil their side of the contract, but Wasteland management took control of ETC, and had an active participation in the running of BUSC Events. During this time Wasteland Ski began talks with BUCS (British Universities and Colleges Sport) to take over BUSC Events.\n\nIn 2013, talks between the BUSC committee, BUCS and Wasteland Ski began regarding the future of BUSC, with the Outlaw Pt.2 committee agreeing to relinquish control to Wasteland Ski as long as three student intern were hired as a gesture to years gone by. With the final BUSC Alpine Championship (Main Event) being held in 2014 in Alpe D'Huez, France, the smallest Main Event on record, the Outlaw Pt.2 committee went against the constitution and the popular vote, refused to hold a new election and handed over control to Wasteland Ski.\n\nOver the years the Championships evolved from being a Ski (Slalom and Giant Slalom only) event held over a weekend in Scotland into a year of events for skiing and snowboarding, racing and freestyle, but mainly catering to students who wanted to get blind drunk.

Consisted of mornings on the Glacier for Ski and Snowboard Race and Freestyle training and afternoons with other activities and sports like mountain biking, swimming, golf, white water rafting, bungee jumping, climbing, beach volleyball and more.\n\nHeld at the end of October for a weekend on the Glacier in Les Deux Alpes the event allowed the organisers of BUSC's constituent member clubs to meet each other and often signals the start of the election process for the following years organising committee. This event was taken over by Wasteland Ski in 2011 and is now the Wasteland Captain's Trip.\n\nThe British Universities Dry-Slope Championships took place at Hillend near Edinburgh in Scotland over the course over a Friday and Saturday in November.

BUSC was the only organisation able to run British Universities and Colleges Sport(BUCS) sanctioned Snowsports events during its time and so the BUCS Alpine Championships were incorporated into the Main Event.\n\n\nAn end of academic year Ski and Snowboard Freestyle competition built on dry slope, using real snow, next to a beach, in a forest, at Beach Break Live festival in June, this event ran until 2012 when Beach Break Live decided to move locations.\n\nWith BUCS taking the competitions to be run in house, they hired a member of the Outlaw pt.2 committee, but like David Cameron, they fcked it for everyone, then walked away. Wasteland Ski then signed a 5 year contract with a 3 year opt out to be the tour operator for the dryslope, indoor and alpine championships, thus taking control of the remainder of BUSC Events. For the 2014-2015 year, Wasteland hired 3 intern, all BUSC veterans. Wasteland Ski initially offered them a wage below the minimum wage, and asked them all to move to London. They did move to London and work out of the Wasteland Ski office but were paid a slightly more reasonable wage.\n\nIn 2015-2016 they hired 3 more interns, delving outside of the BUSC dedicated, 2 promptly quit and the final became a Wasteland employee. With BUSC solely ran by Wasteland, the student led era had finally ended.\n\nWith 2015-2017 being solely run by Wasteland, this seemed to continue into 2017-2018 until BUCS decided to opt-out of using Wasteland Ski as their tour operator and cancel the Alpine Championships, instead they held a Spring Dryslope Championships in Stoke. Due to a change in what people want from trips and with a regular year on year decline in competitor numbers it looks like the old way of student snowsports has come to an end.\n\n"}
{"id": "844283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=844283", "title": "Cantera", "text": "Cantera\n\nCantera, literally meaning \"quarry\" in Spanish, is a term used in Spain to refer to youth academies and farm teams organized by sports clubs. It is also used to refer to the geographical area that clubs recruit players from. The term is widely used in football but is also applied to other sports, such as basketball. This article, however, is about the football \"canteras\". Notable canteras include those of Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atlético Madrid, Espanyol, Sporting de Gijón, Celta de Vigo and Valencia.\n\nSince 1912, Athletic Bilbao have employed a \"cantera policy\", which has come to be defined in an official (although not legally binding) signing policy whereby they will only recruit players with some link to the Basque Country. One of the main beneficiaries of the policy has been the Spain national team. Athletic has provided numerous players for it, second only to Real Madrid.\n\nDuring the early 1920s, the Basque Country was a breeding ground of great Spanish players. It was the first area where the sport really became popular, and the influx of immigrants from all over Spain was also a factor in the region producing dozens of quality players. In 1920, Spain made their international debut and entered a team in the Olympic Games. Of the 21 players in the squad, 14 were Basques, among them Pichichi, José María Belauste, Domingo Acedo and Félix Sesúmaga.\n\nThroughout their history, Athletic Bilbao have continued to produce many notable players while adhering to their policy. Among them were Telmo Zarra, the then all-time top La Liga goalscorer; José Ángel Iribar, 614 official matches with Athletic and a member of the Spain team when they won the European Championship in 1964; and Andoni Zubizarreta, who made a record 622 La Liga appearances and is also the second most capped Spanish international player. Other notable graduates of the Athletic cantera include Bata, Agustín Gaínza, José Luis Panizo, Andoni Goikoetxea, Julio Salinas, Julen Guerrero, Rafael Alkorta, Andoni Iraola, Fernando Llorente and Kepa Arrizabalaga. Their youth teams continue to be among the most productive in Spain.\n\nAthletic were not the only club to have a cantera policy — fellow Basque club Real Sociedad operated a similar policy until 1989. Neither were Athletic the only Basque club that provided players for the 1920 Olympics squad. Real Sociedad, Real Unión and Arenas Club de Getxo also provided players. In 1928, these four clubs became founding members of La Liga, demonstrating further the strength in depth of the Basque canteras at the time. The saying \"Con cantera y afición, no hace falta importación\", translated as \"With home-grown teams and supporters, there is no need for imports\", made sense during these early days.\n\nThe ability of the Basque Country to produce great players was made clear during the early 1980s when Sociedad and Athletic won four Liga titles in a row between 1981 and 1984. The Sociedad team included, among others, Roberto López Ufarte, José Mari Bakero, Luis Arconada and Jesús María Zamora. Xabi Alonso, a World Cup winner in 2010, is also a product of Real Sociedad's youth system.\n\nAlthough Barcelona and Real Madrid are well known for regularly recruiting foreign players, both are renowned worldwide for producing local players. Along with Athletic Bilbao (see Bilbao Athletic), both clubs have notable reserve teams (Barcelona B and Real Madrid Castilla respectively) that are predominantly made up of Spanish players. \n\nNumerous senior players have graduated through the ranks of Barcelona's \"La Masia\" academy, including Francisco Carrasco, Ramón Calderé, Guillermo Amor, Albert Ferrer, Pep Guardiola, Sergi, Iván de la Peña, Francesc Arnau, Óscar, Roger, Gabri, Gerard, Luis García Sanz, Oleguer, Pepe Reina, Thiago Motta, Fernando Navarro, Xavi, Cesc Fàbregas, Carles Puyol, Víctor Valdés, Mikel Arteta, Andrés Iniesta, Bojan, Jeffrén, Lionel Messi, Giovani dos Santos, Gerard Piqué, Sergio Busquets, Pedro, Cristian Tello, Thiago, Rafinha, Marc Bartra, Gerard Deulofeu and Sergi Roberto, though it should be noted some of these were recruited from overseas before signing professional terms, so are not \"home-grown\" in the traditional sense, if in the technical sense.\n\nSimilarly, numerous notable professional players have graduated Real Madrid's youth academy, known as \"La Fábrica (the factory)\". In 1966, Madrid won the European Cup with a team of 11 Spanish players and a Spanish coach, marking the first time a home-born team had won the competition. Many great homegrown players have since passed through the ranks, among them \"La Quinta del Buitre\" — Emilio Butragueño, Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vazquéz, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. Graduates of the cantera also include Iker Casillas, Álvaro Arbeloa, Esteban Granero, Raúl, Guti, Luis García Fernández, Juan Mata, Kiko Casilla, Borja Valero, Rubén de la Red, Dani Carvajal, Álvaro Negredo, Roberto Soldado, Rodrigo, Dani Parejo, José Callejón, Juanfran, Javi García, Álvaro Morata, Jesé and Lucas Vázquez. The club has also produced some notable managers, including Vicente del Bosque and Rafael Benítez.\n\nAs well as producing players from their own regions, both clubs have also recruited young players from throughout Spain and internationally. Recent examples include Argentines Lionel Messi, Mauro Icardi and Esteban Cambiasso.\n\nEver since the early days of football in Spain, one issue for \"cantera\" clubs is the poaching or recruiting of their players by other clubs. After the cantera has trained a player, another club will step in with a tempting offer and take them away. The potential of the Basque Country as a recruiting ground for players was recognised by the likes of Barcelona, Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid early on. Barça, in particular, has a long history of signing players from the region, dating back to the acquisition of Félix Sesúmaga. Others have included Jesús Garay, Jesús María Pereda, José Ramón Alexanko, Javier Urruticoechea and, in more recent times, Santiago Ezquerro. During the 1980s and 1990s, Barcelona poached a number of top Basque players, among them José Mari Bakero, Txiki Begiristain, Andoni Zubizarreta, Julio Salinas and Ion Andoni Goikoetxea, enabling manager Johan Cruyff to build the legendary \"Dream Team\" around them.\n\nThe successful Atlético Madrid teams of the 1960s also included a notable Basque presence in the form of Miguel Jones and José Eulogio Gárate, both recruited from Indautxu, and Javier Irureta, signed from Real Unión. Real Madrid has also regularly looked north for players such as Rafael Alkorta, Mikel Lasa, Aitor Karanka and Iván Campo.\n\nAthletic Bilbao, however, have also been regularly accused of poaching. The Athletic policy of recruiting only Basque-players has seen them frequently recruit from the canteras of other Basque clubs; indeed, the legendary Athletic player of the 1930s, Guillermo Gorostiza, was actually signed from Arenas Club de Getxo. In 1995, Athletic signed Joseba Etxeberria from Real Sociedad, causing considerable ill feeling between the two clubs.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the poaching of players took on a new dimension. Real Madrid in particular have regularly produced quality players unable to establish themselves with their home club. Some critics have argued that this has partly arisen because these clubs continue to use \"imports\" at the expense of cantera players. As a result, many graduates of the canteras seek their fortune elsewhere and are willing to be poached. Initially, cantera players only moved to other Spanish clubs, but in more recent times, English Premier League clubs have begun recognizing the potential of the canteras. In 2003, Arsenal persuaded Cesc Fàbregas to leave Barcelona B with a much higher salary that Barcelona could not offer due to Spanish contractual law.\n\nMore recently, teenage star Fran Mérida followed Fàbregas' footsteps and played some time for Arsenal's reserve team before returning to La Liga in 2010 with Atlético Madrid. Another emerging Barça B player, Gerard Piqué, subsequently signed for Manchester United, though he has since moved back to Barcelona. Since then, Rafael Benítez, himself a product of the \"cantera\", has recruited Luis García Sanz, Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso and Fernando Torres for Liverpool, while Mikel Arteta established himself at Everton. Luis García Sanz, Reina and Arteta all began their career at Barça; Alonso started out at Real Sociedad; and Torres developed in the Atlético system.\n\nOther important canteras are:\n\nEspanyol (\"youth system\"): Raúl Tamudo, Sergio, Joan Capdevila, Dani Jarque, Alberto Lopo, Javi Guerra, Sergio Sánchez, André Bikey, Enrique de Lucas, Tintín Márquez, Ricardo Zamora, Jordi Gómez, Albert Serrán, Miquel Soler, Bruno, Miguel Palanca, Coro, Daniel Solsona, Jordi Lardín, Joan Golobart, Víctor Ruiz, Raúl Baena, Dídac Vilà, Joan Tomàs, Miquel Robusté, Javi Márquez, Javier Chica, David García, Eric Bailly, Jordi Amat, Álvaro Vázquez, Jonathan Soriano, Jordi Xumetra and Ricardo Saprissa.\n\nSevilla: Sergio Ramos, José Antonio Reyes, Antonio Puerta, Jesús Navas, Diego Capel, Lolo, Carlos Marchena, Alberto Moreno, Sergio Rico, Luis Alberto and Manolo Jiménez .\n\nValencia: Jordi Alba, Juan Bernat, José Luis Gayà, Paco Alcácer, David Silva, Javi Navarro, David Albelda, Raúl Albiol, Pablo Hernández, Sisi, Jaime Gavilán, David Navarro, Vicente Guaita, Andrés Palop, José Molina, Miguel Ángel Angulo, Juan Sánchez, Gaizka Mendieta, Paco Camarasa, Javier Farinós and Fernando.\n\nAtlético Madrid: David de Gea, Abel Resino, Joel Robles, Roberto, Antonio López, Juan Manuel Ortiz, Ignacio Camacho, Mario Suárez, Ibrahima, Rubén Pérez, Mario, Javier Arizmendi, Manu, Diego Rivas, Iván Cuéllar, Gabi, Braulio, Juanma López, Roberto Solozábal, Tomás, Toni, Raúl, Juanito, Koke and Fernando Torres.\n\nOsasuna (\"youth system\"): José Ángel Ziganda, Ion Andoni Goikoetxea, Iñigo Larrainzar, José Mari, César Cruchaga, Javier López Vallejo, Santiago Ezquerro, Marí Lacruz, Patxi Puñal, Tiko, Pablo Orbaiz, David López, Javier Flaño, Miguel Flaño, Raúl García, Oier, Javi Martínez, Nacho Monreal, César Azpilicueta, Roberto Torres, Mikel Merino and Álex Berenguer.\n\n"}

As a child he spent his free time outdoors exploring and playing in the fields and woods around his village. At age 18, Le Corre received a black belt in Karate. Starting at age 19 he did parkour-like training for 7 years with the Parisian stuntman Don Jean Habrey. During this period he also began barefoot running. At age 27, he began a period of training which included sailing, Olympic weightlifting, rock climbing, long distance triathlon, trail running and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.\n\nIn 2004 Erwan Le Corre started researching the physical training method of the French naval officer Georges Hébert. The training developed by Hébert is known as \"la méthode naturelle\" (\"natural method\"). In 2008 Le Corre formally began his physical education system and lifestyle known as MovNat and began teaching it in weekend workshops and weeklong outdoor retreats.\n\nIn the 2010s Le Corre was based near Santa Fe, New Mexico. \n\nAccording to Le Corre, MovNat is \"a school of physical competency entirely based on natural movement, which includes the locomotive skills of walking, running, balancing, crawling, jumping, climbing and swimming, the manipulative skills of lifting, carrying, throwing and catching, and the defensive skills of striking and grappling[,and that t]he most important principles of natural movement are practicality and adaptability.\"\n\nRegarding the difference between Hébert's \"méthode naturelle\" and Le Corre's MovNat, Le Corre has said that \"the main difference resides in the coaching system, which has been updated. It is more elaborate and efficient in MovNat... MovNat's philosophy is formulated to better fit with today using modern forms of communication, for instance video and the Internet.\"\n\nLe Corre is releasing his first book entitled \"The Practice of Natural Movement: Reclaim Power, Health and Freedom.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It is part of the North Charleston Convention Center Complex, which also includes a Performing Arts Center, and is owned by the City of North Charleston and managed by SMG. The Coliseum was built in 1993 (the Performing Arts Center and Convention Center opened in 1999), and is located on the access road to the Charleston International Airport.\n\nThe Coliseum is home to the ECHL's South Carolina Stingrays professional ice hockey team and serves as an alternate home for the Charleston Southern University basketball team. It is the area's primary venue for concerts and other major indoor events expected to draw large crowds. The Coliseum is currently undergoing an expansion project intended to increase concourse space, provide additional points of sale, and create venues for banquets, receptions, and other smaller-scale events. The arena contains 9,875 permanent seats, including 7,175 in the upper deck, and 1,646 riser seats.\n\nThe Coliseum is the current home of the South Carolina Stingrays, a minor league professional ice hockey team that plays in the ECHL. When construction first began on the arena there were no plans to include ice-making equipment. However, after an ECHL franchise application for the city of North Charleston had been pre-approved by the league in April 1992, the city council approved the funds required for the installation of an ice surface into the building that was already well under construction. The Stingrays began play there for the 1993–94 ECHL season.\n\nIt is the alternate home arena for the Charleston Southern University basketball team. Typically, Charleston Southern University uses the Coliseum for non-conference games that draw audiences greater than their home arena's 798-seat capacity, such as cross-town rivals College of Charleston and The Citadel. Furthermore, its size allows them to play major conference teams such as Virginia Tech at home (some major conference arenas do not seat 10,000). In addition, The North Charleston Coliseum has hosted the Big South Conference (1993–94) and the Southern Conference basketball tournaments.\n\nThe Coliseum has previously hosted arena and indoor football teams, as well as a National Basketball Development League team, as well as an all female production of Ben Hur that drew several noise and indecency complaints.\n\nIn addition to sporting events, the arena hosts concerts, comedy shows and various other events. The Coliseum has served as the venue for several televised events, to include pay-per-view after the Florence Civic Center's infrastructure failed (1996), WCW Uncensored (1997), Shania Twain (2004), WWE Raw (2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2013, 2015), PBR Built Ford Tough Series (2006), \"Wheel of Fortune\" (2006), and \"American Idol\" (2007, 2011) and \"The X Factor\" (2013) auditions.\n\nOther major concerts and events have included KISS playing their final show with the original lineup (2000), Oprah Winfrey (2006), Walking with Dinosaurs (2008), a CNN Presidential Debate (2012), a Fox Business Presidential Debate (2016), Kid Rock (2008, 2011), Taylor Swift (2009), The Dave Matthews Band (in 1996, and since 2005), Kenny Chesney (2011), Jay-Z (2013), Brad Paisley (2011, 2014), Prince (2011). and Trans-Siberian Orchestra's winter concerts and Beethoven's Last Night shows (2004-2012).\nThe Coliseum hosted Metallica in '93 Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, Columbia's Hootie & the Blowfish with Greenville's Edwin McCain in '95, Gainesville's Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in '95, Athens GA's R.E.M. in '95, Green Day in '95, Macon GA's Allman Brothers Band in '96, Pearl Jam in '96, Stone Temple Pilots in '97, Jay-Z in '99, and N'SYNC in 2000.\n\nPlanning for the coliseum began in 1985, when a city-sponsored study determined that the city could support a venue seating 10,000-plus people. In October of that year, the McNair Realty and Development company of Greenville, South Carolina, who owned the 400-acre Centre Pointe development tract, donated 30 acres of that land valued at approximately $100,000 an acre to the city for construction of the coliseum. The coliseum was originally planned to be part of a redevelopment dubbed \"City Center,\" which was to include the coliseum, a convention center, a performing arts center, a transportation hub, a library, an art gallery and museum, an arts school, parking garages, and scenic park areas, and was to have been completed by 2000. As of June 2011, only the coliseum, convention center, and performing arts center have been completed.\n\nIn September 1988, the city considered five architectural firms for design and supervision of the coliseum's construction, eventually settling on Odell Associates, Inc. City Council approved a $25 million budget for design and construction of the coliseum and by February 1991 accepted a $19.8 million bid for the construction contract by McDevitt and Street Co. of Charlotte, North Carolina. Construction began on April 29, 1991, with an estimated completion time of 20 months. In September 1992, the City Council approved $879,000 to fund installation of an ice rink in the coliseum, which at that time was scheduled for completion by December 26 of that year. The ECHL Board of Governors met in November 1992 to vote on bringing a hockey franchise (whose application had been pre-approved that April) to the Charleston area. At that meeting, the league approved creation of the expansion franchise for the 1993–94 ECHL season, giving the coliseum its first professional sports team as a tenant.\n\nThe coliseum opened its doors on January 29, 1993 to a capacity crowd with its first event, the World Cup Figure Skating Champions ice skating exhibition. The opening night was plagued by parking issues that resulted in traffic congestion on local roads and up to an hour delay in clearing the parking lots following the show. The following night saw another sellout crowd for a concert featuring country music star Alan Jackson, for which the traffic problems were reduced due to early arrivals and improved traffic direction. The city expedited the expansion of available parking spaces from 4,000 to 5,030 soon after.\n\nOn November 10, 1997, the 5-ton coliseum scoreboard dropped while it was being lowered, landing on and killing Billie Wayne Garrett, a rodeo volunteer from Columbia, South Carolina. Coliseum officials believed the issue was with the board's hoisting mechanism, which was manufactured by a New Jersey company that had recently experienced hoist failures in two of its mechanisms, one resulting in a scoreboard dropping to the floor. The fall also caused a crack in the coliseum floor, but it was repaired and no damage was found to have been done to the piping system that makes ice for the coliseum floor. Garrett's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company that manufactured the scoreboard, the company that had recently inspected and passed the scoreboard, and Ogden Entertainment, the coliseum's managing company. The lawsuit was settled for $3.5 million. An upgraded scoreboard featuring improved video panels and a safer hoisting setup was installed in October 1999. This scoreboard was replaced in 2012 by another video scoreboard, part of a $21 million renovation that saw the addition of two food courts, the largest of which is the 7,400-square-foot Montague Terrace, as well as a new ticket office and upgrades to eight luxury suites.\n\nIn August 2000, Ogden Entertainment—which had managed the coliseum since its opening in 1993—was purchased by Aramark. Aramark urged city officials to transfer management of the coliseum to SMG, of which Aramark was a half owner at the time, in an effort to leverage SMG's entertainment industry connections to bring more concerts to the area. In an effort to bolster attendance at the coliseum, which had been operating at a loss for two years, SMG took over management of the coliseum in late 2001, agreeing to construct a large freestanding marquee visible from Interstate 526 as part of the management contract.\n\nAn ambitious expansion project was approved for financing by the city of North Charleston in 2009. The expansion consists of extensions built onto the Coliseum's north and south entrances, increasing concourse space by and adding up to 40 additional points of sale for concessions. The expansion will allow for renovation of existing suites and upgrades to the Coliseum's sound system, spotlights, and rigging bridges. Construction on the south side extension, dubbed Montague Terrace, commenced in August 2010 with a planned completion date of October 2011. Construction of the north side extension was completed in 2012.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1092645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1092645", "title": "Result (cricket)", "text": "Result (cricket)\n\nThe result in a game of cricket may be a \"win\" for one of the two teams playing, a \"draw\" or a \"tie\". In the case of a limited overs game, the game can also end with \"no result\". Which of these results applies, and how the result is expressed, is governed by Law 16 of the laws of cricket.\n\nThe result of a match is a \"win\" when one side scores more runs than the opposing side and all the innings of the team that has fewer runs have been completed.\nThe side scoring more runs has \"won\" the game, and the side scoring fewer has \"lost\". If the match ends without all the innings being completed, the result may be a draw or no result.\n\nThe result of a match is a \"tie\" when the scores are equal at the conclusion of play, but only if the side batting last has completed its innings (i.e. all innings are completed, or, in limited-overs cricket, the set number of overs has been played or play is terminally stopped by weather or bad light).\n\nThis is unusual in Test cricket: only two tied Tests have ever occurred.\n\nIn some forms of one-day cricket, such as Twenty20, a Super Over or a bowl-out is used as a tiebreaker to decide a result that would otherwise be a tie. In such cases, the result of the match is recorded in official statistics as Tie+W or Tie+L to indicate matches tied and then won or lost in the tiebreaker.\n\nThe result of a match is a \"draw\" if a match is concluded, as defined in Law 16, without being a win or a tie. A draw therefore occurs when the one or both of the teams have not completed their innings by the scheduled end of play. In matches where the number of overs is not limited, therefore, a team unable to win may be able to 'save the draw' by either avoiding being all-out if they are batting (i.e. by having two or more batsmen left at the end of play who are 'not out'), or, if bowling, by slowing down the scoring of the batting team. The match is then drawn regardless of the total of runs accumulated by either side.\n\nA \"no result\" is recorded if a limited over match which has been started cannot be completed. This would usually occur if weather or light interrupts play. The result is effectively the same as a draw.\n\nLimited overs cricket formats require that each team can bat for a sufficient number of overs in order for a result to be possible. As of 2016 this stands at 20 overs in One Day International cricket and five overs in Twenty20 cricket. If each team is able to face at least this number of overs a result is possible and can be calculated using the Duckworth–Lewis method or other competition rules.\n\nA match can be \"abandoned\" if weather or other conditions prevent any play from occurring at all. If the bowler of the first over of play has not started his/her runup when the officials decide to abandon play then the result is termed 'abandoned without a ball being bowled'. Such a game is not included in official statistical records.\n\nBefore July 2004, the same result occurred if the toss had been taken but the match was abandoned before a ball was bowled. Since 2004, the International Cricket Council for International matches has decreed that a match where the toss takes place but which is abandoned without a ball being bowled is either a draw or (for a limited-overs match) a no result. Such games are now included in statistical records, counting, for example, as a game played by the teams and nominated players.\n\nThe umpires also have the power to \"award\" a match to one side where the other side either concedes defeat or in the opinion of the umpires refuses to play, in which case the game can be deemed to have been forfeited by the side in question. (Note that this is not the same as the (voluntary) forfeiture of an innings under Law 15.) This power is very rarely used. Before this rule was introduced there had been cases in the international arena where one team has refused to play, or deliberately stopped playing for a while. One notable incident was when Sri Lanka temporarily stopped play against England when Muttiah Muralitharan was called for throwing by umpire Darrell Hair.\n\nThe only time that a Test match has been won in this manner is when umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove awarded England the Fourth Test against Pakistan on 20 August 2006 after Pakistan refused to take the field at the scheduled time after tea on the fourth day. This was because Hair alleged that Pakistani bowlers tampered with the ball. He did not name a player involved in the incident. Later during the ICC general body meeting in 2008, the result was changed to \"match drawn\", and then in February 2009 changed back to an England win.\n\nLaw 16 allows a team to concede a match. This seldom happens, but it covers the situation where the scoreboard has in good faith displayed an incorrect score which is accepted by the \"losing\" team, who leave the field, thereby conceding the match to the opposition.\n\nThe result of a cricket match is stated in several ways.\n\nIf the side batting last wins the match without losing all its wickets, the result shall be stated as a win by the number of wickets still then to fall. For example, in a single-innings match, if Team A bat first and make 200 runs, then Team B make 201 after losing four wickets out of ten, Team B is said to have \"won by six wickets\", regardless of how many batsmen Team A lost during their innings.\n\nIf the side fielding last wins the match, the result shall be stated as a win by runs. For instance, if Team A bat first and make 200 runs, but Team B make only 192, Team A is said to have \"won by eight runs\".\n\nIf the side batting last has lost all its wickets, but as the result of an award of 5 penalty runs at the end of the match has scored a total of runs in excess of the total scored by the opposing side, the result shall be stated as a win to that side by penalty runs.\n\nIn a two-innings match, if the number of runs scored in its first innings by the side due to bat last is greater than the total runs scored by the opposition in both its innings, the result is stated as a win by an innings and number of runs short. Here \"due to bat last\" includes a team who batted first, but forced their opponent to follow on. If Team A bat first and make 200 runs in their first innings, Team B make 300 runs in their first innings, and Team A only make 95 runs in their second innings, Team B is said to have \"won by an innings and five runs\".\n\nIf the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as \"Match Conceded\" or \"Match Awarded\".\n\nIf a match is unfinished when time expires, the result is a \"draw\" (this does not apply to limited overs cricket, where this is considered to be \"no result\"). If all innings of both teams are completed (either because all batsmen have been dismissed or one/more innings are completed by way of a declaration) \"and\" the totals are exactly equal, the match is a \"tie\".\n"}

{"id": "690195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=690195", "title": "Spin bowling", "text": "Spin bowling\n\nSpin bowling is a bowling technique in cricket and the bowler is referred to as a spinner.\n\nThe main aim of spin bowling is to bowl the cricket ball with rapid rotation so that when it bounces on the pitch it will deviate from its normal straight path, thus making it difficult for the batsman to hit the ball cleanly. The speed the ball travels is not critical, and is significantly slower than that for fast bowling. A typical spin delivery has a speed in the range 70–90 km/h (45–55 mph). However, in 2010 Shahid Afridi of Pakistan bowled the fastest spin delivery of 134  km/h in a T20 match against New Zealand\n\nSpin bowling is divided into four different categories, depending on the particular physical technique used. There is virtually no overlap between the two basic biomechanical techniques of wrist spin and finger spin.\n\nDepending on technique, a spin bowler uses either predominant wrist or finger motion to impart spin to the ball around a horizontal axis that is at an oblique angle to the length of the pitch. This sort of spin means it is also possible for the Magnus effect to cause the ball to deviate sideways through the air, before it bounces. Such deviation is called \"drift\". The combination of drift and spin can make the ball's trajectory complex, with a change of direction at the bounce.\n\nThis variety of trajectories achievable by a spin bowler can bewilder inexperienced or poor batsmen.\n\nSpin bowlers are generally given the task of bowling with an old, worn cricket ball. A new cricket ball better suits the techniques of fast bowling than spin bowling, while a worn one grips the pitch better and achieves greater spin. Spin bowlers are also more effective later in a game, as the pitch dries up and begins to crack and crumble. This again provides more purchase for the spinning ball and produces greater deviation. Spin bowlers that open the bowling are rare, but became a more a viable option with the introduction of Twenty20 cricket when pitch conditions are in their favour, and the ball also generally drifts more in the air.\n\nBoth finger spin and wrist spin bowlers use a range of different angles of spin to confuse the batsman and dismiss him. Many of these variations have direct equivalents in the other discipline, but the names used for the various deliveries may be different.\n\nIn recent times, spin bowling has been a forte of the bowlers from the South Asian sub-continent. The primary reason for that is that the pitches in the sub-continent provide more help to the spin bowlers. The faster the pitch degenerates, the earlier the spinners come into the picture. Australian and South African pitches are usually very hard and bouncy, helping the fast bowlers more. They do not break up very much during the duration of the match. In contrast, pitches in the sub-continent are not that hard. They are not usually held together by the grass as much; hence they break up more quickly and help spin bowlers. In general, leg-spin is considered to be one of the toughest types of bowling in which to keep control of the ball, but it is very effective in picking off wickets.\n\nIt is customary among cricket commentators to describe and judge the quality of spin bowling in terms of the characteristics \"flight\", \"turn\", \"bounce\", \"drift\", and \"dip\". All these are arts to deceive the batsman and require lots of practice. The basic trajectory of spin bowling is two-lines-at-an-angle, but the above characteristics (described below) modify this 'normal' trajectory into more complex shapes.\n\nTurn: How much the ball turns after pitching (e.g. 5 degree deviation after meeting the ground). It depends on the number and direction of revolutions of the ball. The movement and rotation of the ball varies, depending on the position of the wrist and the finger. An occasional unexpected straight ball can usefully be included in an attack, but spin variation is the main technique used to deceive the batsman and take wickets. A high rate of turn is above 33 rev/second, or 2000 rpm, which Graeme Swann consistently spin over 2000 rpm, the most amongst English spinners until Liam Dawson also topped 35 rev/second, or 2100 rpm. Also, the slower the ball, it tends to deviate more. For an offspinner, you will have to bowl from a wider of off-stump to get the ball to turn into the right-handed batsman and force them to nick off the edge to a fielder or into the top of off stump.\n\nBounce: Getting the ball to bounce more than normal, so that the ball meets the batsman at a greater height than expected. Sometimes, if the ball spins horizontally (e.g. a slider), the batsman will not be able to make contact with the ball and it may hit the stumps before the second bounce.\n\nDrift: Getting the ball to move sideways while in air. Late drift causes the batsman to cover the wrong line and the ball may catch the edge of the bat.\n\nDip: Getting the ball to pitch (meet the ground) at a shorter distance than normal. Late dip causes the batsman to misjudge the length of the ball.\n\nFlight: throwing the ball up a bit more than normal, so that its time in the air before pitching is longer. A slow ball with extra flight may deceive the batsman into thinking it is slower than it is and therefore mistiming his shot. This is very effective for offspinners. Usually a spin bowler relies on tricks during flight to produce turn, bounce, drift and dip, or combinations of them.\n\n\n\n"}

Hundreds of people line up along Gumstool Hill (an extremely steep street) in the centre of Tetbury, Gloucestershire to watch the teams. Each competitor must carry a full woolsack on his / her back and race either up, down or up and down the hill.\n\nThe races take place between two public houses, the Royal Oak (the bottom of the hill) and the Crown (at the top). People can take part either as individuals or as part of a team. The individuals race up the hill, the teams (with 4 members swapping places at each end of the course) race up and down the hill twice.\n\nThe men race with a 60 lb woolsack, ladies have 30 lb. There are also youth races where boys ages 16–18 races with a 30 lb sack and a children's class. The weight of the children's woolsack isn't specified but it's probably about the same as a pillow.\n\nRegular competitors include local rugby teams, the British Army and the Norfolk Mountain Rescue Team.\n\nThis website contains information from the 2002 and 2003 Woolsack Races: Link\n\n"}
