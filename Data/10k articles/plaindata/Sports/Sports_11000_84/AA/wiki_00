{"id": "28663179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28663179", "title": "Circuit of the Americas", "text": "Circuit of the Americas\n\nCircuit of the Americas (COTA) is a grade 1 FIA specification motor racing facility located in Elroy, Texas, on the southeastern periphery of Travis County, in Central Texas. COTA plays host to the Formula One United States Grand Prix and the Motorcycle Grand Prix of The Americas, a round of the FIM Road Racing World Championship. It previously hosted the Australian V8 Supercars, the American Le Mans Series, the Rolex Sports Car Series, the FIA World Endurance Championship, and the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.\n\nThe circuit and Grand Prix were first proposed in the middle of 2010. The circuit was the first in the United States to be purpose-built for Formula One. The layout was conceived by promoter Tavo Hellmund and 1993 Motorcycle World Champion Kevin Schwantz with the assistance of German architect and circuit designer Hermann Tilke, who has also designed the Sepang, Shanghai, Yas Marina, Istanbul, Bahrain, Yeongam, and Buddh circuits, as well as the reprofiling of the Hockenheimring and Fuji Speedway. The circuit has FIA Grade 1 license.\n\nIn a news conference on July 27, 2010, Tavo Hellmund announced plans to build the track on about of undeveloped land in southeastern Travis County. The majority of the site had been planned to be developed into a residential subdivision called \"Wandering Creek\". In the same news conference, Hellmund also revealed that Texas billionaire Red McCombs was the project's largest investor. McCombs wished to call the site \"Speed City\", but the owners originally anticipated selling the naming rights to various parts of the facility for $7 million. On April 12, 2011, the track's name was announced as \"Circuit of the Americas\" at a press conference.\nThe circuit homologation design was submitted to the FIA in Geneva for approval on December 17, 2010. HKS, Inc. and Tilke Engineers & Architects designed the track and Austin Commercial, a subsidiary of Austin Industries, was the general contractor. Construction began on December 31, 2010, and was due to be complete by June 2012. Following a stop-work order in December 2011, the completion date was revised to August. The first tasks were building the silt fences, taking core samples, and shredding existing vegetation.\n\nOn January 21, 2011, a $900,000 check was posted with Travis County that permitted grading to begin. The money was to be used to restore the land if the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declined to allow the project to move forward because part of the site lies in a floodplain. FEMA issued a letter on June 28, 2011, stating the project meets its floodplain management criteria.\n\nIn January 2012, Travis County announced that Elroy Road—one of the two primary public access roads to the circuit—would receive an upgrade to handle the volume of incoming traffic, but not before the running of the 2012 race. At the time of the announcement, the unstable clay soils under the road surface had caused Elroy Road to gradually buckle and shift, necessitating the upgrade.\n\nOn June 13, 2012, Charlie Whiting—the FIA-appointed Race Director for Formula One—declared himself satisfied with the circuit's construction, scheduling a final pre-race inspection of the circuit for September 25, sixty days before the first race, which the circuit later passed.\n\nThe first layer of asphalt was completed on August 3, 2012. Construction began laying the final layer of asphalt on August 14, and was finished on September 21. The track was officially opened on October 21, with Mario Andretti running the ceremonial first laps in a Lotus 79, the car he drove when he became the last American to win the World Drivers' Championship in 1978.\n\nA crowd of 117,429 watched the Formula One race in November 2012.\n\nThe Grand Plaza, Observation Structure, Tower Amphitheater, and Main Grandstand were designed by Austin-based architectural firm Miró Rivera Architects.\n\nIn order for the race to take place, the Austin city council was asked to be the sponsoring municipality for the event. Through being a sponsor, the city could apply for money from a state fund, the Major Events Trust Fund (METF), designed to attract major sporting events to Texas that would be used to pay the Formula One race sanctioning fee. This matter was complicated by opponents of the project who filed a lawsuit against state comptroller Susan Combs, claiming that she had promised the funding to the circuit without having been legally authorized to do so, though promoters have responded stating that all necessary guidelines had been followed. On July 1, 2011, a state district court judge declined to enter a temporary restraining order against Combs preventing payments from the METF; nonetheless, Texas Comptroller Combs reconsidered and chose not to make the July 31 advance payment to FOMC/Bernard Ecclestone as previously agreed for the first year's sanctioning fee. The attorney for the project's opponents has stated that he is unsure if they will continue pursuing the lawsuit.\n\nIn June 2011, the Austin city council agreed to allow the circuit to apply to the Texas Major Events Trust Fund but withheld its full endorsement requiring the circuit to pay the financial match normally borne by the local government sponsor. As a part of the endorsement, the sport will pay $15,000 in carbon offsets and $5 million to establish an on-site research project into environmentally friendly technologies.\n\nIn November 2011, Bernie Ecclestone expressed what he called \"minor\" doubt over the future of the United States Grand Prix in Austin after \"disagreements inside the [management] company\". These issues were later confirmed when construction of the circuit came to a halt because of a dispute between the circuit owners, promoter Full Throttle Productions, and Formula One Management. Promoter Tavo Hellmund admitted that his company had been in breach of its contract with Formula One Management since May 2011. The situation further escalated when state comptroller Susan Combs described the planned Grand Prix of America as a threat to the race in Texas, and said that the first $25 million payment from the state sports fund would only be made available after the first Grand Prix at the circuit, despite having previously promised to make the funds available in time for the inaugural event. Bernie Ecclestone later issued an ultimatum to the owners and organizers: find a solution before the December 7 meeting of the FIA World Motorsport Council or else risk being removed from the 2012 calendar. Ecclestone emphasized that if the Circuit of the Americas were removed from the calendar, it would not be added again at a later date.\n\nOn December 7, 2011, the World Motorsport Council released the final calendar for the 2012 season, with the Circuit of the Americas retaining its November 18 date. Further details revealed that the race investors, McCombs and Epstein, had reached a new arrangement with Ecclestone, with work on the circuit scheduled to resume immediately. As a part of the arrangement, organizers paid the sanctioning fee for the 2012 race one year in advance as a show of good faith. At the time of the circuit's reinstatement, there were no reports supporting Tavo Hellmund's continued involvement under the new contract. On March 4, 2012, \"The Austin American-Statesman\" reported that Hellmund had launched legal proceedings against investors Bobby Epstein and Red McCombs, with Hellmund claiming that he was still a part of the management company and had not been paid since September. Further details emerged, reporting that Hellmund was in the process of attempting to acquire Epstein's interest in the company, describing the condition of the circuit as of March 4 as \"teetering\". Epstein responded to the lawsuit by stating that Hellmund had been found to have been in breach of contract by Formula One Management.\n\nIn June 2012, the dispute between Hellmund and Epstein was reported to have been settled out of court.\n\nIn April 2011, plans were unveiled by Tavo Hellmund of Full Throttle Productions and Kevin Schwantz of 3fourTexas for the circuit to host a round of the 2013 MotoGP World Championship, with the race to be known as the Texas Grand Prix. The race was the brainchild of Schwantz, the circuit co-designer, who would serve as event promoter with his company, 3fourTexas. However, following the settlement of the lawsuit between Tavo Hellmund and Bobby Epstein, Schwantz announced that he would be suing Steve Sexton. Schwantz claimed that upon the resolution of the dispute between Hellmund and Epstein, Sexton moved to negotiate directly with MotoGP's commercial rights holder, Dorna Sports, ignoring what he claimed was an existing contract between Dorna and 3fourTexas to hold the race. Circuit representatives denied that there was ever a contract between Schwantz and the Circuit of the Americas, and that his dispute was with Dorna Sports. Dorna later claimed that although a contract for the race between Dorna and Schwantz had existed, the contract had been terminated in July 2012 as they believed Schwantz had failed to acquire the necessary rights from the circuit to hold the race. Schwantz then accused Sexton and the Circuit of the Americas of \"undermining\" him, deliberately blocking his attempts to establish a race in order to have the contract terminated and allowing them to negotiate a more-favourable arrangement with Dorna.\n\nIn October 2012, Dorna Sports announced that they had come to agreeable terms with organisers of the Texas motorcycle Grand Prix, including the race on the 2013 calendar as the Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Americas, but made no mention of the dispute with Schwantz or any outcome of it.\n\nPrior of the 2014 Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Americas, the circuit announced that COTA and Schwantz had amicably settled their legal differences and reached an agreement to collaborate to promote motorcycling racing, with Schwantz taking the role as official ambassador for COTA.\n\nIn an episode of Speed TV's \"Wind Tunnel\" program broadcast on August 22, 2010, Tavo Hellmund revealed that the circuit would be 3.4 miles (5.5 km) long and would be made up of twenty turns with an elevation change of 133 feet (41 m). The final plan of the circuit was released on September 1, 2010, showing a design inspired by the European tradition of sculpting the circuit to the contours of the land. The design draws from several European Formula One circuits, including a recreation of Silverstone's Maggotts-Becketts-Chapel sequence, Hockenheim's arena bends, and a replica of Istanbul's Turn Eight. Other corners were loosely inspired by the Senna 'S' at Interlagos and the Österreichring's Sebring-Auspuffkurve. A feature of the circuit is a deliberate widening of corners, to encourage drivers to follow multiple racing lines. A similar feature was used at the Buddh International Circuit in India, where the circuit widens on the approach to certain corners.\n\nThe circuit was one of only a handful on the Formula One 2012 calendar to be run counter-clockwise, the others being Marina Bay, the Korea International Circuit, Yas Marina, and Interlagos. Because of this, the circuit contains more left-hand turns than right-hand ones, placing greater physical demands on the drivers whose bodies, particularly their necks, are more adapted to the lateral g-forces of clockwise circuits.\n\nFrom the start line, the drivers climb a gradient of over 11% to the first corner—the highest point of the circuit—with the apex of the corner positioned on the crest of the hill. They descend the hill to navigate a series of fast sweepers modeled on Silverstone's Maggotts-Becketts-Chapel complex and through a blind corner at Turn 10, taking them to the far end of the circuit and a hairpin at Turn 11. The drivers then follow a straight back towards the pit and paddock area before entering the final sector of the lap and weaving through a series of corners modeled on Hockenheim's stadium section. This is followed by a downhill, multi-apex corner with limited run-off before the final two corners of the circuit, a pair of left-hand bends that return the drivers to the main straight.\n\nThe reception from drivers ahead of the inaugural race was highly positive. Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton both praised the circuit, suggesting that it would be considerably more difficult to learn than other recent additions to the Formula One calendar. Jenson Button described the first sector as \"spectacular\", but remarked that he felt that starting second would be better than starting first as the placement of pole position put it on a steeper incline than the rest of the grid. Kamui Kobayashi, on the other hand, was less complimentary, claiming that he did not feel intimidated by the steep climb to the first corner as it was no different from Eau Rouge at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, and accusing the media of hyping it up without precedent. Mark Webber was also unimpressed, stating that while he enjoyed driving the first sector of the circuit, the second and third sectors were similar to other circuits on the calendar.\n\nBordered by the track on three sides, the Grand Plaza is a space designed by Miró Rivera Architects of Austin, Texas that includes a large reflecting pool, lawn, and varying landscape zones. A promenade along the north side of the Grand Plaza hosts concessions, retail, restroom facilities, and entrances to spectator seating. From the southeast end of the Grand Plaza, two pedestrian bridges cross over turns 16 and 3 to provide access for visitors to other areas of the circuit complex.\n\nCircuit of the Americas features a observation tower designed by Miró Rivera Architects and built by Patriot Erectors as a landmark for the venue. The structure of the tower consists of an elevator hoist-way surrounded by a double helix staircase of 419 stairs, both of which lead to an observation platform above ground level. The platform provides a 360-degree panorama of the circuit, as well as views to downtown Austin, Texas. The observation platform, which is accessible to the public for an admission fee, can accommodate up to 70 visitors and features glass railings and a partial glass floor. In addition, a \"veil\" consisting of 18 bright red steel tubes runs nearly the full height of the tower, acting as a canopy for both the observation platform and the stage below. The design of the observation tower was inspired by the visual imagery of sports cars and movement, and the red color was selected to mimic the streaks of lights trailing racecars at night.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, COTA announced a booking agreement with Live Nation to book major concerts at an open air amphitheater to be built at the base of the observation tower. Designed by Miró Rivera Architects, the venue opened in April 2013 with a concert by Kenny Chesney.\nThe amphitheater accommodates up to 14,000 people with 5,240 permanent reserved seats. Another 1,700 seats can be configured on the stage-front floor or there is standing room for 2,300. The remaining general admission spots are on a sloping grass area behind the reserved seats. The venue was originally going to be called Tower Amphitheater, but in March 2013, was renamed to Austin360 Amphitheater, with naming rights sold to the entertainment/events website associated with the \"Austin American-Statesman\".\n\nThe primary permanent seating at Circuit of the Americas is located within the Main Grandstand, designed by Miró Rivera Architects. Above-ground construction on the grandstand began in March 2012, and the \"topping out\" occurred in June 2012 with completion in time for the inaugural United States Grand Prix.\n\nThe Main Grandstand is tall, and has a total capacity of approximately 9,000 spectators. The seating is divided into three levels: lower level (capacity ~5400, including Loge Boxes), club level (capacity ~2900), and suite level (capacity ~750). The majority of seating is covered by a tensile fabric canopy. The primary structure is long, while the lower risers extend an additional 500 feet. The grandstand also contains concessions, restrooms, offices, and two lounge spaces located at the second and third levels. The Velocity Lounge on the second level is approximately , and contains a 36-screen video wall and the acrylic painting \"Velocity\" by Dallas-based artist Christopher Martin measuring in length.\n\nBoth the Main Grandstand and the concessions buildings in the Grand Plaza were conceived as a modular system consisting of several components that can be arranged according to need. The concessions, with banners and deep canopies, can be expanded with restrooms, permanent seating or suites. Inherent to this “kit-of-parts” construction system is flexibility allowing the site to grow and change.\n\nIn August 2017, a new soccer-specific stadium was announced to be built between the Amphitheater and the Grand Plaza. A professional soccer team known as Austin Bold FC will start playing in the USL Championship in 2019.\n\nOn September 4th of 2018, IndyCar announced that it has reached a multi-year agreement to add the Circuit Of The Americas to its calendar replacing ISM Raceway, finalizing the IndyCar Series calendar. COTA will debut on the IndyCar Series schedule on Sunday, March 24. It will serve as the second race of the 2019 campaign. The addition of COTA at the end of March fills the large gap between the first and second races that has existed that past couple of years. Often it seemed as if the some of the momentum built by the series at the season-opener in St. Petersburg was lost by the time Indy cars got back on track a month later. Now with COTA in the fold for late-March, there will only be one off week between the season-opener at the second race of the season. This will be the first time since 2014 that 2 tracks in Texas will be on the IndyCar series calendar.\n\n† uses a shorter 3.7 km section of the track.\n\n"}

They can be divided into metal mesh gloves, cut-and-sewn, and seamless knitted gloves.\n\nMetal mesh gloves are a form of chainmail, and are made of rings of stainless steel. They are typically used in food applications.\n\nCut-and-sewn gloves can be made by a cut-resistant material or by conventional materials with full or palm lining of cut-resistant materials. The materials are cut to shape and sewn into a glove.\n\nSeamless knitted gloves are knitted in one piece by a flat knitting machine. The cut protection is provided by high performance materials such as Para aramid (Twaron, Kevlar), HPPE (High Performance Poly Ethylene, Dyneema, Spectra), special PVA yarns (SupraBlock) or steelfibre and fibreglass yarns. Thick gloves are usually knitted on a 10gauge machine while thinner and more flexible styles are knitted on a 13gauge machine. The gloves are usually coated with solid or foamed Latex, Nitrile or Polyurethane.\n\nCut resistance has many dimensions such as force, direction, sharpness of the blade, length of the cut and flexibility of object. Different products should be evaluated in relation to the expected type of cut risk and environment that they are expected to face. It should be noted that the cut resistance in the standards described below as well as resistance to scissors cut has no or limited correlation.\n\nThe cut resistance is evaluated by the EN388:2003 or the ISO 13997 standard. The EN388 use a circular rotating blade of 40mm diameter that rotates against the direction of movement. The blade is moving back and forth over a small distance of about 50mm with load of 5N. The numbers of cut cycles are recorded and compared to a cotton control fabric. The cut resistance is rated between \"0\" and \"5\" depending on the average number of cycles prior to break-through failure: \"0\" means 0 to 1.2 cycles; \"1\" means >1.2 to 2.5 cycles; \"2\" means >2.5 to 5.0 cycles; \"3\" means >5.0 to 10.0 cycles; \"4\" means >10.0 to 20.0 cycles; and \"5\" means >20.0 cycles.\n\nThe EN388 is expected to be updated in 2016 or 2017, the most significant change is an introduction of the ISO 13997 concept. The new EN 388:2016(?) will incorporate a letter A-F to indicate the cut resistance of A<2N, B<5N, C<10N, D<15N, E<22N and F<30N. This is more in line with the new American standard of ANSI 105-15 that is using a system of A1-A9 with interval closely resembling to the proposed EN 388:2016(?)but adding 3 higher levels of A7>4000g, A8>5000g and A9>6000g.\n\n\n"}

It was founded to try to find the best games all-rounder in the world and hence possibly the best games player. It was given a prize fund of £10,000 for the inaugural competition, that equalled\nthat of the highest funded event at the first MSO sponsored by Skandia. However, the other events were spread over multiple playing sessions whereas the Decamentathlon was held over just a single session. This event was initially hailed as the MSO flagship event. Although, the Mind Sports Olympiad's other new event the Pentamind has since become regarded as the more significant event despite not having a fixed format.\n\nThe Mind Sports Olympiad was described as the Olympics of the mind. The Decamentathlon and Pentamind were an attempt to replicate the ideas of the decathlon and pentathlon from athletics.\nUnlike the Pentamind which has a free format allowing competitors to use different events to each other, the Decamentathlon has a fixed format. The Decamentathlon comprises\na 4 hour test which is split into 10 events (see below). Each event was either a reduced version of the full event when played in competition or a written paper. Each event carries a maximum score\nof 100 points so the maximum possible score is 1000 points.\nThe complexity of setting the event and marking it has meant that the only place to have held a Decamentathlon is the Mind Sports Olympiad where the annual world championship is held.\n\nThe Decamentathlon was originally divided into ten tests in the following events:\nbridge, chess, creative thinking, draughts 8x8 / checkers, go, intelligence, mastermind, memory skills, mental calculations, othello.\n\nThe memory section was initially run in a fixed format where competitors have to memorise a single deck of cards and a list of 48 random words (previously the second part was memorisation of a 96 digit number).\nFrom 2008 the Decamentathlon world championships was held using a backgammon test in the place of bridge.\n\nFor 2011 the memory section was switched again, the random words section being replaced by a random 50 digit number to be memorised. The othello and backgammon sections were also removed in favour of a Sudoku test and a Word puzzles test.\n\nThere has been controversy over the claim that the event had an inherent English language bias. This was especially on the sections of creative thinking and intelligence. This view is reinforced by there only having been one non-native English speaker to have won the World Championships, Gert Schnider from Austria. Although, the fact that three of the winners of the Decamentathlon have won the Pentamind in years other than when they won the Decamentathlon implies that this bias might be small.\nThere have also been issues of marking errors and the official answers not being accurate. This has resulted in medals being changed after they have been presented.\n\nThe World Championships have taken place as part of the MSO since 1997.\n\n"}

However talented these individual cricketers were, they were unable to fetch results, resulting in the West Indies being perceived as \"Calypso Cricketers\"; people who were entertaining, but would ultimately lose.\n\nThe early 1970s saw the emergence of a new crop of West Indian cricketers, ones eager to shake the tag of Calypso, and who could dominate world cricket. However, it is said that when you have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the cricket field. That man was Clive Lloyd. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the 1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia.\n\nAustralians Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson destroyed the West Indies with their fast bowling. Frequent bouncers and intimidatory tactics led to the spirit of the team being shattered and the tour ended with Australia winning the six-match test series 5-1. At the end of the series, Clive Lloyd realizes that in order to win, it would be necessary for him to also cultivate fast bowlers as devastating as Lillee and Thomson.\n\nWhen the Indian Cricket Team toured the West Indies in 1976, Clive Lloyd tested his new plan of attack, relentlessly getting his fast bowlers such as Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, and Colin Croft to bowl short-pitched or bouncers to Indian batsman. While playing at Kingston, Jamaica the Indian team declared on a second-innings lead of 12, after the management decided that they would rather not risk sending their bowlers such as Bishen Singh Bedi to face the fearsome fast bowling.\n\nConvinced of the effectiveness of pace bowling as an instrument to success, Clive Lloyd's team departed to their Tour of England in 1976. England Captain Tony Greig's infamous \"grovel\" comment is shown in its entirety, and the effect it had on galvanising the team is described. After some highly aggressive fast bowling against the English batsmen, West Indian fast bowling is seen as being dangerous to the game. However, the West Indians feel that if the Australians could do it, so could they. Viv Richards is shown as dominating the Test series as a batsman, where he scored 829 runs in four tests with two double-centuries. Viv Richards' refusal to be intimidated by fast bowling is also seen as the ideal way for a batsman to deal with West Indian bowling.\n\nThe documentary then describes the struggle with their board for better pay, and how Kerry Packer eventually enticed the team to participate in World Series Cricket in 1977. World Series Cricket turns out to be a fore-runner of changes in cricket that only became permanent in the 1990s; such as coloured kits, day/night matches, and a greater emphasis on professionalism in play. The West Indian team emerges from the tournament fitter, stronger, and with a more professional outlook to the game.\n\nThe 1982 Rebel Tour to Apartheid-ruled South Africa is described. Colin Croft chooses to go, earning him a life ban from the West Indies Cricket Board. The main target of the regime, however, is international superstar Viv Richards. Richards states that he was offered \"a blank cheque\", but decided to not go as it would validate the state-sponsored racism pursued by the South African Government at the time.\n\nIt ends with a description of the West Indies' tour to England in 1984. With the emergence of fast bowling greats such as Joel Garner and Malcolm Marshall to take the place of Croft, the West Indies becomes unstoppable. After Gordon Greenidge's innings of 214 not out at Lord's, the West Indians become an unstoppable force; defeating England 5-0 in the five-test series. In a turn on the regular term \"Whitewash\" to describe such a win, the series was instead dubbed Blackwash.\n\nThe documentary ends with a description of how the West Indians earned the respect, admiration, and love of cricket fans and even opposing teams from across the world. As the end credits roll, Michael Holding describes how between February, 1980 to March, 1995; the West Indies Cricket Team did not lose a single Test series. (it was preceded by the controversial West Indies tour of New Zealand in 1979–80)\n\n"}

{"id": "59044907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59044907", "title": "Kick (running)", "text": "Kick (running)\n\nA kick in a running race is the ability of some athletes to sprint at the end of an endurance oriented race. For those who possess the ability to kick, it is a strategic weapon. For those with the liability not to possess a kick, they must seek different strategies to anticipate and diminish their opponent's kicking power, usually by a long extended surge to break away or exhaust their opponent well ahead of the finish of the race. Similar to a Sprinter in cycling, a kicker has a finite distance they know they are able to sprint, making their strategy to be in the ideal position at that distance to be able to utilize that speed. Sprinting too early could lead an athlete to tie up, a form of rigor mortis before reaching the finish line. Thus team tactics might also intentionally or not, box a kicker, meaning to position other competitors to their outside, to disrupt their positioning and timing. Of course, as the finish is nearing and all athletes are straining, this becomes more difficult to accomplish deliberately.\n\nIn modern history, most championship races turn strategic. Very rarely will an athlete risk going out on their own to attempt to breakaway, therefore leaving the race result to the best timed kick. While the drafting effects of pack running are not as accentuated as they are in a cycling Peloton, the psychological teamwork of a unified group rarely rewards the breakaway athlete. Some notable exceptions include Almaz Ayana, who not known for her sprint speed, broke away to take 2016 Olympic 10,000 metres in world record time. A week later, the same Vivian Cheruiyot she had vanquished in the 10,000m, did not let her breakaway in the 5000. Ruth Jebet also burned off her opponent's kick in the steeplechase.\n\nIn the 800 metres, some athletes develop the reputation for being a kicker because of their apparent speed at the end of the race, when in reality the ran even splits. Most of that speed is relative to the exhaustion as their opponents slow. Dave Wottle, James Robinson, Yuriy Borzakovskiy, Nick Symmonds and Amel Tuka would take the beginning of the race out slowly, re-gaining contact with the rest of the field near the last 200 metres. At the elite men's level, that even pace would be about 26 seconds per 200 meters; a 52 second first lap, as compared with the leaders close to or under 50 seconds. World record holder David Rudisha burned off the kickers during his world record 2012 Gold medal. When he won the 2015 World Championships, he blew away even paced kickers like Tuka with a remarkably fast final 24.34 200 metre true kick of his own.\n\nGenerally most long kickers or extended kickers would accelerate in the penultimate lap or shortly after the bell indicating the last lap has begun. A speed kicker would behave more like an anchor runner in a 4x400 relay, positioning themselves on the shoulder of their opponent and using their burst of speed as late as the final straightaway.\n\nMo Farah developed a reputation as a strategic runner. His finishing kick was not so much a burst of speed, but his extended ability to repeatedly accelerate just enough to discourage anybody from passing him during an intense final lap or so of his races. His Nike Oregon Project teammate Matthew Centrowitz Jr. employed a similar form of holding the lead to win his 2016 gold medal in the 1500.\n\nBecause of the advantage of having the tool of a kick in a competitor's arsenal, the techniques to train to kick are a common discussion among runners and coaches.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "61588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61588", "title": "King Baudouin Stadium", "text": "King Baudouin Stadium\n\nThe King Baudouin Stadium (, ) is a sports ground in north-west Brussels, Belgium. It was inaugurated on 23 August 1930. Crown Prince Leopold attended the opening ceremony. Located in the Heysel section of the Brussels municipality, it was built to embellish the Heysel plateau in view of the 1935 Brussels International Exposition. The stadium hosted 70,000 at the time. A wooden track for cycling races was later added around the pitch.\n\nThe original name was Jubilee Stadium (, ) because it was inaugurated days after Belgium's 100th anniversary, with an unofficial Belgium-Netherlands football match. In 1946 the stadium was renamed Heysel Stadium (French: \"Stade du Heysel\", Dutch: \"Heizelstadion\"). It hosted European Cup finals in 1958, 1966, 1974, and 1985 and Cup Winners' Cup finals in 1964, 1976 and 1980. The highest attendance at a European game was over 66,000 in 1958.\n\nDespite its status as Belgium's national stadium, Heysel was not well maintained. By the time of the 1985 European Cup Final, it was in a very poor state. For example, the outer wall had been made of cinder block, and fans who did not have tickets were seen kicking holes in it to get in. The abject stadium conditions, along with poor crowd control procedures and football hooliganism are widely considered to have contributed to the Heysel Stadium disaster, which resulted in the deaths of 39 spectators before the match. Following the disaster, the ground was only used for athletics (track and field) and it still hosts the Memorial Van Damme every year.\n\nIn 1995, a decade after the disaster, the ground was rebuilt at a cost of BEF 1,500 million (around €37/$50 million in 1995), and at this time renamed King Baudouin Stadium, after the Belgian monarch who had died two years previously. All that remains of the old stadium is a renovated gateway near the main entrance. The new structure combined the football ground with a running track and facilities for field events.\n\nIt was re-opened on 23 August 1995 as the home of the Belgium national football team and is the largest stadium in Belgium; it can seat 50,093 spectators. The remodeled stadium hosted the 1996 European Cup Winners Cup final, as well as the opening game for Euro 2000.\n\nOn 26 May 2006, the Belgian Football Association decided not to use the King Baudouin Stadium anymore for the national team home matches and for the Cup final, because the gates of stand one were too narrow and the stadium was deemed unsafe. The next match of the national team was thus held at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. The city of Brussels complained that contrary to these claims the stadium was safe, and this complaint was upheld in court. On 6 October 2006, the Belgian Football Association met with representatives of the city of Brussels and they agreed to renew the contract and extend it to 30 June 2008. Since 15 November 2006, the Belgian national football team has used the King Baudouin Stadium.\n\nOn 25 August 2007, Belgium played Argentina in rugby union as part of Argentina's 2007 Rugby World Cup preparations. Argentina defeated Belgium 36-8.\n\nThe stadium was scheduled to witness a rugby union milestone on 19 December 2009, when the Parisian club Stade Français planned to take their Heineken Cup home match against Irish club Ulster to the stadium in a match that had sold more than 30,000 tickets. However, heavy snowfall in Brussels on the intended matchday forced the cancellation of what would have been the first Heineken Cup match held in Belgium; the fixture was instead played the following day in Paris.\n\nThe stadium had another shot at hosting a Heineken Cup match in 2012. On 20 October 2012, English club Saracens took their Heineken Cup pool match against Racing Métro 92 to Brussels.\n\nOn 8 July 2010 the stadium played host to the Best of Belgium gala which featured a tennis match originally scheduled to be between Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters. Unfortunately Henin had to pull out and Serena Williams replaced her as the match was played in front of the largest crowd ever for a single match, beating the attendance set at the Battle of the Sexes.\n\nU2 performed at the stadium three times: the first one was on 10 June 2005 during their Vertigo Tour, in front of a sold out crowd of 60,299 people. The second and the third were on 22 and 23 September 2010 during their U2 360° Tour, in front of a total sold out crowd of 144,338 people. The performance of \"Mercy\" from the first 2010 show was recorded for the group's live EP \"Wide Awake in Europe\". The performance of \"I Will Follow\" from the same show was recorded for the group's live album \"\".\n\nThe Rolling Stones, Celine Dion, Madonna, Mylène Farmer, Robbie Williams, Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen, Beyoncé, One Direction, Johnny Hallyday and Coldplay have also played concerts at the stadium.\n\nTo celebrate the 75th anniversary of the stadium the Belgian state released a commemorative coin: the 10 euro 75 years of Heysel Stadium commemorative coin. The obverse depicts an image of a footballer with the stadium in the background. The flags of Belgium and the Netherlands can be seen on top of the stadium as well as the year that the stadium was built.\n\n\n"}

The discovery of these breaches in 2016 by the NRL resulted in it stripping the Eels of the twelve competition points the club has accrued so far in the 2016 NRL season. In addition to being fined $1 million, Parramatta also had its 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title revoked.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2016 NRL season, the Parramatta Eels faced the prospect with starting the season on -4 points due to salary cap indiscretions in 2015, however the NRL was satisfied with governance changes at the Eels and no points were deducted.\n\nHowever, it was revealed in March that third-party payments had been made by several companies to several players, which is strictly prohibited in the NRL.\n\nOn 3 May 2016, NRL CEO Todd Greenberg announced that the club would be docked the twelve competition points they have accrued so far this season, as well as fined $1 million and stripped of the 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title it won in February. In addition, the NRL also announced that the Eels would not be able to accrue any further competition points until they fall under the salary cap, which they were reported to be $500,000 over as of 3 May 2016. Five officials, including chairman Steve Sharp, deputy chairman Tom Issa, director Peter Serrao, chief executive John Boulous and football manager Daniel Anderson, were also sacked.\n\nOn 9 July, after over 2 months of club officials contesting the preliminary penalties, Parramatta were handed their punishment with the addition of their for/against points tally accumulated from rounds 1-9 being deducted.\n\nThe main point of interest in this episode was the manner of the punishment when compared to the Melbourne Storm salary cap breach in 2010, while the Melbourne Storm were not allowed to play for points for the whole season the Parramatta Eels were permitted to play for points as soon as they fell back in line with the cap. It was acknowledged that this change was made due to the demoralising nature of the Storm punishment and having to witness a team running out week after week with nothing to play for.\n\nThe aftermath ended with Parramatta hooker Nathan Peats being squeezed out of the club, so the club would be just under the salary cap and start playing for competition points for the remainder of the season. Though this did very little for the troubled club finishing the NRL season 13th on the ladder winning only six of their last 14 matches.\n\n"}

{"id": "18878999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18878999", "title": "Russian boxing", "text": "Russian boxing\n\nRussian boxing (Russian - Кулачный бой \"Kulachniy Boy\" \"fist fighting, pugilism\") is the traditional bare-knuckle boxing of Russia.\n\nThe earliest accounts concerning the sport date to the 13th century.\nSupposedly, fist fighting was practiced even prior to the Christianization of Kievan Rus', at celebrations dedicated to Perun.\n\nMetropolite Kiril, in 1274, created another one of many personally-instituted rules, declaring expulsion from Christianity for any of those who fist-fight and do not sing a prayer or hymn at the burial of someone who died during a fist fight. The government itself never supported, but also never opposed fist fighting.\n\nRussian boyars used the sport as mass entertainment, and acquired the best fighters for competitions.\n\nThe fights most often took place in holiday times and in crowded places. In winter it took place on ice. First the young children fought, then every pair was more grown up than the previous, ending with the last and most notable fist fighters.\n\nIn two orders released in 1684 and 1686 fist fighting was forbidden, but the sport continued to live.\n\nAll regions had their heroes at the sport, but the region with the most famous ones historically is Tula.\n\nThere are documents saying Peter the Great liked to organize fist fights \"in order to show the ability of the Russian people\".\n\nIn 1751, a mass fist fight took place on a street in Saint Petersburg, which came to the attention of Empress Elizabeth of Russia. After that the Empress forbade the organization of fist fights on the territory of Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\nDuring the reign of Catherine the Great, the popularity of fist fighting was growing again, and it is said that Count Orlov was a good fist fighter himself and even invited notable fist fighters to compare powers.\n\nIn 1832, Nicholas I of Russia completely forbade fist fights as \"harmful fun\".\n\nIn 1941 the most important then Soviet specialist in Boxing, K.V. Gradopolov, wrote a book about the right way to fight with fists. In that book, he offered a new exercise, called \"group boxing\", and he mentioned it was an ancient Russian sport (what he was talking about, was the \"Stenka na Stenku\" version).\n\nEvery region in Russia incorporated different rules unlike the sport of boxing. In some places they fought with bare arms, while in other they stretched the sleeves over the fists. There were cases where participants would cheat by putting iron under their sleeves.\n\nThere are three types of Russian fist fighting: the first is the singles type, a one-on-one fight; the second type is a team fight also known as \"wall on wall\". The third one, \"catch drop\", was the least practiced. There were several versions of the singles fight. One version was like modern boxing, where one fighter hits the other wherever he wants or can. The other version is when the fighters take turns hitting each other. Escaping from a punch, answering it not on turn, and moving aside were not allowed; all that could be done was to use the hands to try to protect one's own body. Victory could come in few cases: when one of the fighters falls, till first blood, or till one of the fighters gives up.\n\nThe \"wall-on-wall\" fight (with anywhere from dozen to several hundreds participants) was performed strictly by rules and could go on for hours. Both \"walls\" had a chief fighter, who served as a tactician and a commanding officer. \"Walls\" themselves were tight straight formations 3-4 ranks deep. Repeated attacks were performed, aiming to push the opposing \"wall\" out of the game area. Basic tactics were used, such as breaching using heavy fighters (who were usually held in reserve), encircling, false retreat and others; but as a rule, tight wall formation never broke. Tactics also included battle planning. The \"wall-on-wall\" fights, while performed for entertainment, were in fact close to military training. For example, notable ethnographer V. Gilyarovsky recalled that during his voluntary service in an infantry regiment soldiers often staged wall-on-wall fistfights with factory workers.\n\nA famous phrase in Russian, \"Do not hit a man when he's down\", has roots in that sport.\n\nAs for centuries fist fighting was so popular and was such a part of Russian folk life, it occurred frequently in Russian literature and art.\n\nThe most famous portrayal of a Russian fistfight is in Mikhail Lermontov's poem, The Song of the Merchant Kalashnikov. There, the fistfight tales place as a form of honor duel between an oprichnik (government police agent) and a merchant. It is notable that, according to Lermontov, both characters use combat gloves ('rukavitsy' — reinforced mittens). Though it may be an example of poetic license, the poem states that the first connected blow by Kalashnikov bent a large bronze cross hanging from his opponent's neck, and the second fractured the opponent's temple, killing him. The fight also features in the opera \"The Merchant Kalashnikov\" by Anton Rubinstein (1880).\n\nIn the 19th century Sergei Aksakov watched famous fist fights in the Kaban frozen lake in Kazan, and later wrote about them in his \"Story about student life\". Some decades later, at the same lake, the young future opera-singer Feodor Chaliapin took part in a similar fight: \"From one side came we, the Russians of Kazan, from the other side the Tatars. We fought hard without feeling sorry for ourselves, but never broke the historic rules of not to hit one that is already down, not to kick, and not to keep iron up one's sleeves\". Later, the young Chaliapin was attacked in a fight over a girl, but thanks to knowing fist fighting he won. He wrote: \"He jumped to beat me, and even though I was afraid of the police, learning fist fighting at the frozen lakes of Kazan helped me, and he humiliatingly lost\".\n\nThe Russian poet Sergei Yesenin in his autobiography notes \"About myself\" told that his grandfather taught him fist fighting.\n\nOne of the heroes in the book \"Thief\" by the Soviet novelist Leonid Leonov said: \"In childhood, it happened, only in fist fights I found real friends... And was never wrong! Because only in a fight the whole human nature comes out\".\n\nClaims have been made that the Russian nobility favoured fistfights over duels, but on the other hand it has been suggested that the nobility actually were against fistfights and preferred weapons.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "623472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=623472", "title": "The Palace of Auburn Hills", "text": "The Palace of Auburn Hills\n\nThe Palace of Auburn Hills, commonly referred to as The Palace, is a defunct multi-purpose arena located in Auburn Hills, Michigan. It was the home of the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Detroit Shock of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), the Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League, the Detroit Safari of the Continental Indoor Soccer League, and the Detroit Fury of the Arena Football League.\n\nThe Palace was one of eight basketball arenas owned by their respective NBA franchises.\n\nBy the time it closed as an NBA venue, the Palace was one of only two arenas which had not sold its naming rights to a corporate sponsor. The other was Madison Square Garden. \n\nThe Pistons court was previously named the \"William Davidson Court\", in honor of the late owner, prior to the home opener on October 28, 2009; however, Davidson's signature, along with the retired numbers, were removed from the hardwood when Tom Gores took over ownership of the Palace, and were re-retired instead atop the Palace rafters as replacement banners.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1978, the Pistons competed in Detroit's Olympia Stadium, Memorial Building, and Cobo Arena. In 1978, owner Bill Davidson elected not to share the new Joe Louis Arena with the Detroit Red Wings, and instead chose to relocate the team to the Pontiac Silverdome, a venue constructed for football, where they remained for the next decade. While the Silverdome could accommodate massive crowds, it offered substandard sight lines for basketball viewing. In late 1985, a group led by Davidson decided to build a new arena in Auburn Hills. Groundbreaking for the arena took place in June 1986. Using entirely private funding, The Palace cost a relatively low price of $90 million. The Davidson family held a controlling interest in the arena until Tom Gores bought it as part of his purchase of the Pistons in 2011.\nThen-Pistons owner William Davidson and two developers privately financed the $90 million construction of The Palace, and did not require public funds.\n\nThe Palace was built with 180 luxury suites, considered an exorbitant number when it opened, but it has consistently managed to lease virtually all of them. In December 2005, the Palace added five underground luxury suites, each containing of space and renting for $450,000 per year. Eight more luxury suites, also located below arena level, were opened in February 2006. They range in size from and rent for $350,000 annually. The architectural design of the Palace, including its multiple tiers of luxury suites, has been used as the basis for many other professional sports arenas in North America since its construction, including the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa, also designed by Rossetti Associates.\nThe Palace opened in 1988. When one of The Palace's basketball occupants won a championship, the number on its address changed. Its current address is 6 Championship Drive, reflecting the Pistons' three NBA titles and the Detroit Shock's three WNBA titles (the Detroit Vipers' 1997 Turner Cup championship has not been officially recognized in the arena's address; the address also remained unchanged despite the Shock's move to Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2010; they moved to Dallas, Texas in 2016, and are now known as the Dallas Wings). The original address was 3777 Lapeer Road.\n\nThe Palace was widely considered to be the first of the modern-style NBA arenas, and its large number of luxury suites was a major reason for the building boom of new NBA arenas in the 1990s. Although the Palace became one of the oldest arenas in the NBA, its foresighted design contained the amenities that most NBA teams have sought in new arenas built since that time. By contrast, of the other NBA venues that opened in 1988-89, Amway Arena, Charlotte Coliseum, and Miami Arena have been demolished, while the Bradley Center and Sleep Train Arena have been replaced, with the former scheduled to be demolished starting in September 2018. All of these arenas were rendered obsolete by the lack of luxury suites and club seating, lucrative revenue-generating features that made pro sports teams financially successful in order to remain competitive long-term, and also being located in suburban rather than downtown areas (the Palace, however, remained one of the successful suburban arenas). \n\nNonetheless, Palace Sports & Entertainment (PS&E) had spent $117.5 million in upgrades and renovations to keep the arena updated. A new high definition JumboTron monitor, new LED video monitors, and more than of ribbon display technology from Daktronics was installed in the mid-2000s.\n\nOn November 19, 2004, a fight broke–out between members of the NBA's Detroit Pistons and Indiana Pacers. As the on-court fight died down, a fan threw a cup of Diet Coke at Pacers forward Ron Artest, who then rushed into the crowd, sparking a melee between players and spectators. The fight resulted in the suspension of nine players, criminal charges against five players, and criminal charges against five spectators. The offending fans were banned from attending games at The Palace. In the aftermath of the fight, the NBA decided to increase the security presence between players and spectators. The fact that the fight took place at The Palace of Auburn Hills led to it becoming colloquially referred to as \"Malice at the Palace\" and \"Basketbrawl\".\n\nThe Palace was also the site of a brawl between the WNBA's Shock and Sparks on July 21, 2008.\n\nAerosmith played the venue 14 times from 1990-2012.\n\nMichael Jackson performed three sold-out shows during his Bad World Tour on October 24-26, 1988.\n\nPink Floyd performed there on 16 and 17 August 1988 as part of their A Momentary lapse of Reason Tour.\n\nBon Jovi performed during their Keep The Faith world tour on March 2nd, 1993, their Crush Tour on November 18, 2000 and their Lost Highway Tour on February 20, 2008.\n\nVan Halen performed 3 shows on their For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Tour on February 21, 1992 and consecutive shows on April 3rd and 4th, 1992. They also performed consecutive shows during their The Balance \"Ambulance\" Tour on April 15th and 16th, 1995.\n\nSting performed during his ...Nothing Like the Sun Tour on August 13, 1988, becoming the very first musical act to perform at The Palace.\n\nThe Cure performed two consecutive shows, during their Wish Tour on July 18–19, 1992, with The Cranes as their opening act. The shows were recorded and released as a live album, entitled \"Show\".\n\nGrand Funk Railroad performed a benefit show for the nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1997 during their Reunion Tour. The show also featured Peter Frampton, Alto Reed, Paul Shaffer, and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. The performance was recorded, and released as the double-live Bosnia album in October of that year.\n\nThe Palace was the site of an attempt on the life of Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, while he was on tour, with former band mate Robert Plant, during their Tour. On March 31, 1995, Lance Alworth Cunningham, a 23-year-old, who thought that Led Zeppelin music contained \"satanic messages\", tried rushing the stage with a knife. He waited until the song \"Kashmir\" started and then made his charge for the stage, waving the weapon. The man was tackled by patrons and security about 50 feet from the stage.\n\nMadonna performed two sold–out shows during her Drowned World Tour on August 25–26, 2001. The shows were recorded and broadcast live on HBO and were later released as a DVD, entitled \"Drowned World Tour 2001\".\n\nIn October 2016, it was reported that the Pistons' ownership were negotiating a possible relocation to Little Caesars Arena, a new multi-purpose venue located in Midtown Detroit built by Olympia Entertainment to replace Joe Louis Arena as home of the NHL's Detroit Red Wings, as soon as the 2017–18 season. On November 22, 2016, the team officially announced that the Pistons would play at Little Caesars Arena in 2017. The final NBA game at The Palace was played on April 10, 2017, with the Pistons losing to the Washington Wizards, 105-101. That game ended a 42-year history of professional sports in Oakland County, dating back to the Detroit Lions' first game at the nearby Pontiac Silverdome in 1975. \n\nOn August 24, 2017, it was announced that Bob Seger would hold the final concert at the venue on September 23, 2017. The last scheduled event at the venue was the Taste of Auburn Hills on October 12, 2017. Palace Sports & Entertainment entered into a joint venture with Olympia known as 313 Presents to jointly manage entertainment bookings and promotions for Little Caesars Arena and other venues owned by the firms. \n\nThe Palace, despite being 29 years old at its closure, is still in top condition as a sporting and concert venue. However, it is located in a northern suburb, relatively far away from the city center, in light of the growing trend of \"walkable urbanism\" where the Pistons want to grow their fanbase. While there have been no official confirmations as of yet, the Palace is likely to end up demolished, and the site could be redeveloped to accommodate a possible new auto supplier headquarters and research and development parks.\n\n"}
