This was the first Games held outside the state of California. It was also the first year for the Masters 35–39 division.\n\nThe men's competition was won by Mathew Fraser, the women's by Tia-Clair Toomey, and Wasatch CrossFit won the Affiliate Cup. Fraser won $309,000 for his efforts and Toomey won $298,000 for her title, as prize money includes both the $285,000 for winning and bonus money ($3,000 for winning, $2,000 for second, and $1,000 for third) in each event. This was the first CrossFit Games in which a podium finisher in the Individual competition was disqualified for using illegal performance-enhancing substances when Ricky Garard tested positive after the Games were complete. As the Games had already concluded, all his finishes were simply voided with all other competitors moving up one position in the final standings as the event points were not redistributed.\n\nAthletes ran to Lake Monona from the Alliant Energy Center, swam around a set of buoys, and then back to the arena. The event was won by Brent Fikowski and Tia-Clair Toomey.\n\nThe event was held nearby in Quann Park and had bikes supplied by Wisconsin-based Trek Bicycle Corporation. The course's obstacles included logs, small wooden hurdles and a sand trap. The event was won by Ricky Garard* and Kristin Holte.\n\nAthletes performed 13 muscle-ups on gymnastic rings and then 13 snatches, followed by 11 muscle-ups and 11 snatches, etc. until finishing the sets of 5. This is a variation of the event \"Amanda\" introduced at the 2010 CrossFit Games as a tribute to former Games athlete, Amanda Miller, who died in 2010 and was known for the pistol tattoos on her hips. The event was won by Dakota Rager for the men and by Jamie Greene for the women.\n\nCompetitors raced head-to-head in three rounds across an obstacle course consisting of a cargo net climb, wall climb, monkey bars, log balances, and a rope ladder. The event was won by Patrick Vellner and Tennil Reed-Beuerlein.\n\nThe event was won by Garret Fisher with a 305-pound lift and Kara Webb with a 203-pound lift.\n\nThe event was a \"chipper,\" a workout involving multiple exercises done sequentially without returning (as in \"chipping away\" at the number of repetitions) for the fastest time. After the 100 pull-ups, the competitors performed 80 sit-ups on a glute-hamstring developer (GHD), a piece of equipment where the feet lock in and the sit-up is performed at a greater range of motion. After the sit-ups, athletes performed 60 one-legged squats, also called \"pistols\", alternating the movement between each leg. The 40-calorie row was performed on a Concept-2 rowing machine. The dumbbells for the push press were 100-pounds for the men and 70-pounds for the women. The event was won by Mathew Fraser and Kara Webb.\n\nThe competitors started on the Assault bike and the calories were 40 for men and 30 for women. After the bike, the athletes used a sledgehammer to hit a weighted block on a recessed track until it had moved 20 feet. The event was won by George Sanchez and Samantha Briggs.\n\nCompetitors had to move a series of strongman elements; a yoke (500 pounds for men, 340 pounds for women), two farmer's logs (200 pounds each for men, 120 pounds each for women), and a sled (400 pounds for men, 310 pounds for women). The objects had to be taken halfway down the field (60 feet) and then the competitor returned using a handstand walk. Once all objects were at the halfway mark, the competitors took the objects to the end of the field, also returning to the middle of the field with a handstand walk. The objects could be moved in any order. Brent Fikowski won the event for the men and Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir for the women.\n\nCompetitors performed each round beginning with four muscle-ups on a pull-up bar followed by two cleans. After each round the weight increased starting with 225 pounds for the men and 145 pounds for the women and ending with 350 and 235 pounds, respectively. Mathew Fraser won the event for the men and Tia-Clair Toomey won for the women.\n\nA heavier version of a previous Open qualifier event in 2017. A double-under is a jumping rope movement where the rope passes beneath the athlete twice per jump. A thruster in CrossFit is a combination of a front squat and push press in one continuous movement and the weights were 125 pounds for the men and 85 pounds for the women. Mathew Fraser won for the men and Kara Webb won for the women.\n\n5 rounds for time of:\n\nAthletes ran around a 450-meter path outside of the stadium. In the stadium, there were five rows of hay bale walls. The athletes would enter the stadium and clean a sandbag up and toss it over the hay bale wall. They would then perform a burpee and then jump over the wall. The hay bale clean burpee would be performed seven times at the same hay bale wall before moving the sandbag to the next wall. After the sandbag is moved, the athletes ran back to the path to make another lap. The sandbags were 100 pounds for the men and 70 pounds for the women. The event was won by Ricky Garard* for the men and Samantha Briggs for the women.\n\n4 rounds of:\n\nThis was an interval event with the first three rounds consisting of two minutes of work and then one minute of rest. The final round was three minutes of work to get as many overhead squats as possible or a total of 75 through all rounds for time. For each round, competitors started with two 20-foot rope climbs. After the rope climbs, the competitors pulled 10 calories for men and 7 calories for women on a SkiErg, a machine built by Concept2 similar to their rowing machines but meant to simulate a cross-country skiing motion. With the remaining time in each interval, they accumulated as many squats as they could with 155 pounds for the men and 105 pounds for the women. The event was won by Mathew Fraser and Katrín Tanja Davíðsdóttir.\n\nMen:\nWomen:\n\nThis event was won by Logan Collins and Ragnheiður Sara Sigmundsdottir. In the men's event, only Collins finished within the six-minute time cap with 2017 Games champion Mathew Fraser ending one lunge from the finish to take second in the event. On the women's side, Kara Webb had been in second-place overall below Tia-Clair Toomey. She edged out Toomey on the event by 0.19 seconds but did not overtake her in total points, finishing two points behind on the final standings.\n\n\n"}

The advert starred Carl Rice and Kevin Staine.\n\nThe advert features two young Liverpool fans with one telling the other that Ian Rush had told him that if he didn't drink milk, he would only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley. The other fan then said \"Accrington Stanley, who are they?\" with the response being \"Exactly.\" According to Rice, Tottenham Hotspur was originally going to be named. However, Tottenham objected, so Accrington Stanley were chosen instead as they were a non-League team at the time and were seen to be a more obscure team. \n\nIt was also claimed by David Lloyd, a non executive director of Accrington Stanley, that the advert earned the club £10,000.\n\nThe advert was popular, and was continually shown for up to six years after it was originally made in 1989. The phrase was seen to make Accrington Stanley the subject of jokes up to the present day. However, residents of Accrington view the reference positively. \n\nIn March 2006, Rice was invited as the guest of honour to watch Accrington Stanley's match against Stevenage Borough and was later invited to Accrington Stanley's last game of the season against Scarborough, as they were promoted to Football League Two. In September 2009, Sky Sports programme \"Soccer AM\" promoted Accrington Stanley's \"Save Our Stanley\" campaign because of the phrase, as they wanted to continue to use it to refer to the club when reading fixture lists.\n\nA shot-for-shot remake advertising Black Cow Vodka, which is made from milk, began airing in September 2016, with a much older Rice reprising his role. The advert was banned from airing in March 2017, due to concerns that it targeted children because of the connection to the original advert, and promoted excessive drinking.\n"}

Several other short-lived pro teams called the city home before World War I, including the Newburgh Taylor-Mades (aka Hill Climbers or Hillies, Hudson River League, 1903–1907); the Newburgh Dutchmen (New York-New Jersey League, 1913) and the Newburgh Hillclimbers (Atlantic League, 1914).\n\nIn 1916, Mrs. Annie Delano Hitch (aunt of Franklin Delano Roosevelt) donated land to the City of Newburgh for a \"driving park\", later known as Delano-Hitch Recreation Park. The stadium was opened in 1926, and has been primarily used for baseball. Four professional teams have called Delano-Hitch home: the Newburgh Hummingbirds in 1946, the Newburgh Nighthawks in 1995-96, the Newburgh Black Diamonds in 1998, and the Newburgh Newts briefly in 2015.\n\nDuring the next half-century, the stadium was used by various amateur and semi-pro baseball teams, as well as by the semi-pro football Newburgh Raiders from 1991-96. (Despite winning four Empire Football League championships, the EFL unanimously voted to boot Newburgh out in 1997 for a variety of reasons, including the fact that Delano-Hitch wasn't really suitable for football.)\n\nIn 1995, owner Bill Cummings brought the Newburgh Nighthawks to town, as a franchise in the new Northeast League (now the Can-Am League). Despite decent attendance figures of about 1,000 per game, Cummings lost over $30,000 and sold the team to Jeff Kunion. The '96 Nighthawks won the NEL first half championship and played the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs for the league title, losing three games to one. The final game of the championship series proved to be the last Nighthawks' game ever, as Kunion, unsatisfied with the pace of stadium renovations, folded the team.\n\nAfter sitting empty in 1997, the stadium got a new team for 1998: the Atlantic League's Newburgh Black Diamonds. However, poor attendance and the league's displeasure with Delano-Hitch's condition sealed Newburgh's fate, despite $150,000 worth of renovations. Minutes before Newburgh's home opener, league president Bud Harrelson announced the Black Diamonds would return in 1999, but only if the team built a new stadium. Instead, the franchise was sent wandering for several years after a proposed stadium in Easton, Pennsylvania was left unfinished after the builders went bankrupt; the team existed as the Road Warriors through 2004, then again in 2006-07.\n\nRecently, Delano-Hitch has been used for amateur baseball, including high school (Newburgh Free Academy), college (Mount Saint Mary College), collegiate league (New York Generals) and American Legion ball. The financial downturn, however, has made it difficult for these teams to afford the rent on the stadium; since 2009, the ballpark has mostly sat empty, except for non-athletic gatherings. On August 7, 2010, Marcus Gill Ministries held a crusade, \"Unity Fest with Minister Marcus Gill\". About 150 people attended the crusade, held to encourage the community to pray for peace and to end crime in Newburgh.\n\nIn 2011, the Newburgh Nuclears American Legion team returned to Delano-Hitch for a series of home games and tournaments, after raising $13,000 for the use of the facility.\n\nIn 2015, Delano-Hitch was briefly the home of the Newburgh Newts of the North Country Baseball League. One of the new league's founding franchises, the Newts' first home game was played May 20 against the Watertown Bucks, kicking off a planned 66-game schedule that was to run through early August. After a series of tiny crowds of around twenty customers per game, the Newts were evicted from Delano-Hitch after three weeks, when their rent check bounced. The franchise continued to operate as a road team (apparently renamed the New York Newts, according to the league website), one of two in the four-team circuit. Despite a slow start and being forced to play all of their contests on the road, the Newts finished 22-17, good enough for a first-place tie with the league's other road team, the Road City Explorers.\n\nIn early August, the Newts won the NCBL championship, sweeping Watertown in a two-game series. The Newts apparently folded after that, as they were not invited to join the four-team Empire Professional Baseball League in 2016.\n\n"}

The stadium is currently home to the Batavia Muckdogs - Class-A short season affiliate of the Miami Marlins; Genesee Community College Cougars - NJCAA; and high school teams including the Notre Dame of Batavia Fighting Irish and Batavia Blue Devils.\n\nThe grandstand and surrounding structure of Dwyer Stadium may be new but the field and area hold over 70 years of professional baseball history. Originally built in 1939 the stadium underwent three names and stood until 1995 when being replaced by the new stadium, keeping the previous name.\n\nState Street Park was built in 1939 and employed 17 local workers to construct. During the first season of play the stadium went unfinished and a snow fence had to be placed for each game to act as the outfield wall while chairs had to be borrowed from a local mortuary for seating. The works project continued through the first season but did not deter fans as 3,000, still a record for Batavia, attended the first game of professional baseball at State Street Park.\n\nDuring World War II the name was changed to MacArthur Stadium after General Douglas MacArthur in an act of patriotism.\n\nBefore the 1973 season the stadium found its final name, Dwyer Stadium, after Edward D. Dwyer, a long time team president that was instrumental in keeping the team in Batavia. The stadium was a wooden and covered grandstand that was famous in old time ballparks.\n\nIn 1995, it was officially announced Batavia would be getting a new $3 million stadium on the same location; the field would remain intact while the grandstand and seating would be torn down and replaced. Auburn and Batavia each got a stadium that was almost carbon copies of one another. The old Dwyer Stadium still has its place in the new stadium as the original Wall of Fame is still present behind the first base bleachers.\n\nDwyer Stadium is primarily used for baseball, though has also been home to area youth football as well throughout its history. Dwyer is the home field of the Batavia Muckdogs minor league baseball team, Short-Season Class-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins and also hosts college games during the spring and fall for the Genesee Community College Cougars as well as local high school games in the spring.\n\nDuring the 2012 season the Triple-A affiliate of the New York Yankees, the Scranton Wilkes-Barre Yankees, were scheduled to play seven games at Dwyer Stadium as the Yankees home stadium PNC Field in Moosic, Pennsylvania underwent renovations. Before the scheduled games the New York Yankees made improvements to the infield and pitchers mound as well as the clubhouse. Due to weather conditions only four Triple-A games were played at Dwyer.\n\n"}

Located at the southeast corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street in the Exposition Park area of Los Angeles, California, United States, it is right across the street from the campus and near the Shrine Auditorium. The Galen Center is the home of the USC Trojans basketball and USC volleyball; in addition it hosts concerts, pageants, theatrical performances, high school graduation ceremonies, CIF championships and the Academic Decathlon. The annual Kids' Choice Awards were held here from 2011 to 2014, and returned in 2017.\n\nUSC had planned to build an on-campus indoor arena for more than 100 years. Before the Galen Center, USC basketball had been played at a variety of locations, including the neighboring Shrine Auditorium stage, the old Pan-Pacific Auditorium in the Fairfax District, and from 1959 onward at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.\n\nThe final push to build the new facility began in 2002, when Louis Galen, a successful banker and longtime Trojan fan, and his wife Helene donated $10 million to the new center immediately after USC football quarterback Carson Palmer won the 2002 Heisman Trophy. The Galens donated an additional $25 million to the project to have the building named after them and later upped their donation an additional $15 million to make sure that a connected practice facility would also bear their name, bringing the total donation to $50 million. Previously, the USC men's and women's basketball teams practiced at the smaller, on-campus North Gym. The Galen Center replaced the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena as the home for USC men's and women's basketball.\n\nGalen Center construction cost an estimated $147 million, which includes the arena, team offices, and a state-of-the-art practice facility. The largest tax revenue would be generated by the city of Los Angeles' 10% parking tax. Other sources of tax revenue will include sales tax, utility users tax, business license tax, and income from advertising. In addition, two new parking structures were built: a 1,200-space structure located between the Radisson Hotel and the arena, with access from Flower Street, and a second structure at the southeast corner of Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard. The additional parking structures also increased the available parking for both the USC campus and the nearby Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThe architectural firm behind the design of the Galen Center is HNTB. Construction officially began on October 31, 2004, with a groundbreaking ceremony including Los Angeles City Council members Bernard Parks and Jan Perry along with Helene and Louis Galen, longtime USC fans for whom the facility is named.\n\nThe first event, a women's volleyball game between USC and Stanford University, took place on October 12, 2006. The first concert at the center was October 21, 2006 and featured Al Green. The first men's basketball was held on November 16 against the University of South Carolina. The first sellout crowd was the men's basketball game against the UCLA Bruins on January 12, 2007 with an attendance of 9,682. The highest attendance in the first year was for the Cal Bears men's basketball game on February 24, 2007 at 10,027.\n\nOn January 31, 2008 the USC men's basketball game against the Arizona Wildcats set the arena's attendance record with crowd of 10,258 in attendance.\n\nOn May 10, 2014 the arena hosted a heavyweight title boxing fight between Chris Arreola and Bermane Stiverne for the vacant World Boxing Council Heavyweight Title. Stiverne won the title after a sixth-round knockout of Arreola, becoming the first Haitian-born boxer to win a world heavyweight championship, as well as the first out of the province of Quebec, to win the WBC world heavyweight championship.\n\nThe Galen Center's basketball court was named after former USC basketball player Jim Sterkel, who played for the Trojans for two seasons in the 1950s, averaging 10 points a game. Two unique factors in the naming rights were the obscurity of the name choice and that the Sterkel family was not aware that the court was named after the late Jim Sterkel until after the facility had already opened. B. Wayne Hughes, a longtime friend of Sterkel's made the $5 million donation under the agreement that his name never be revealed. In an interview with \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Bill Plaschke, who tracked down Hughes but did not reveal his name, 'Anonymous' said that he grew up with Sterkel: both attended Mark Keppel High School, both began at USC in 1955 and were roommates.

An item in the 8 June 1844 issue of Littell's Living Age headed \"The Glaciarium\" reports that \"This establishment, which has been removed to Grafton street East' Tottenham-court-road [sic],was opened on Monday afternoon. The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating\".\nA later rink was opened by John Gamgee in a tent in a small building just off the Kings Road in Chelsea, London, on 7 January 1876. In March, it moved to a permanent venue at 379 Kings Road, where a rink measuring 40 by 24 feet was established.\n\nThe rink was based on a concrete surface, with layers of earth, cow hair and timber planks. Atop these were laid oval copper pipes carrying a solution of glycerine with ether, nitrogen peroxide and water. The pipes were covered by water and the solution was pumped through, freezing the water into ice. Gamgee had discovered the process while attempting to develop a method to freeze meat for import from Australia and New Zealand, and had patented it as early as 1870.\n\nGamgee operated the rink on a membership-only basis and attempted to attract a wealthy clientele, experienced in open-air ice skating during winters in the Alps. He installed an orchestra gallery, which could also be used by spectators, and decorated the walls with views of the Swiss Alps.\n\nThe rink initially proved a success, and Gamgee opened two further rinks later in the year: at Rusholme in Manchester and the \"Floating Glaciarium\" at Charing Cross in London, this last significantly larger at 115 by 25 feet. However, the process was expensive, and mists rising from the ice deterred customers, forcing Gamgee to close the Glaciarium by the end of the year, and all his rinks had shut by mid-1878. However, the Southport Glaciarium opened in 1879, using Gamgee's method.\n\n"}

The opening speedway meeting here was staged on 23 March 1929, when Arthur Franklyn won the Golden Helmet. Following the announcement that Stuart Bamforth had sold the stadium for redevelopment, the last speedway meeting was staged on 1 November 1987, when a double header took place.

Categories include (explicit) icebreaker, parlour (indoor), picnic (outdoor), and large group games. Other types include pairing off (partnered) games, and parlour races. Different games will generate different atmospheres so the party game may merely be intended as an icebreakers, or the sole purpose for or structure of the party. As such, party games aim to include players of various skill levels and player-elimination is rare. Party games are intended to be played socially, and are designed to be easy for new players to learn.\n\nThe characteristics of party games tend to include:\n\n\nTraditional children's party games include:\n\n\"BYTE\" in 1981 called \"Olympic Decathlon\" (1980) \"the first true party game for microcomputers\". Another early example is Starpath's \"Party Mix\". Party video games are commonly designed as a collection of simple minigames, designed to be intuitive and easy to control, and allow for competition between a large number of players. Some of the games (most notably the \"Mario Party\" series) are played out on boardgame boards.\n\nLarge group games are played by a large number of participants and are often used as planned activities in structured environments, especially as educational activities. They are similar to party games, except that large group games are typically planned for larger numbers (perhaps even hundreds) as part of an event.\n\nLarge group games can take a variety of forms and formats.\n\nSome are physical games such as Buck buck.\n\nSome are modeled on the TV game show format, offering points for teams who can answer questions the fastest. Trivia-type games might have questions posed from the stage and each tabletop writing their answers to be collected and scored. Others may take on some of the qualities of Open Space environments and allow participants to wander in a less structured way.\n\nSome are modeled on TV reality shows such as The Amazing Race or Survivor. Participants compete as individuals or in teams to complete challenges that move them towards victory in a competition spanning the entire party. The TV shows on which such parties are based are normally competitions involving elimination, so such events require significant planning to avoid exclusion or boredom.\n\nGroup board games can take on the design of small groups of players, seated at tables of 4 to 6 people, who work together on a problem. There can be large numbers of people (and thus many tables). If properly designed, these scalable exercises can be used for small groups (12 to 20 people) as well as very large events (600 people or 100 tables).\n\nGenerally, for these larger exercises, multimedia projectors, large screens and microphones are required for instructions and communications.\n\nA search for team building events can turn up millions of links to exercises, companies, and all kinds of offerings ranging from paintball competitions to fire walks to outdoor climbing or whitewater adventures. The impact on actual team building can vary widely - a golf outing for corporate executives does not generally accomplish much in the way of organizational improvement while a business simulation might be directly focused on linking the play of the game to issues for corporate improvement.\n\nHoliday groups use a gift exchange party game such as white elephant gift exchange for socializing and sharing gifts. New online party games, based on these holiday games, allow larger groups to gather on the internet to save travel expenses.\n\n"}

It was located in Rainier Valley, on the NE corner of S. McClellan Street and Rainier Avenue S. The longtime home of the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, it hosted the Seattle Pilots during their only major league season in 1969.\n\nThe site was previously the location of Dugdale Field, a 1913 ballpark that was the home of the Rainiers' forerunners, the Seattle Indians. That park burned down in an Independence Day arson fire in 1932, and until a new stadium could be built on the Dugdale site, the team played at Civic Field, a converted football stadium at the current location of Seattle Center's Memorial Stadium.\n\nSick's Stadium first opened in 1938 on June 15 as the home field of the Seattle Rainiers (the renamed Seattle Indians) of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). It was named after Emil Sick, owner of the team and of the Rainier Brewing Company. The Rainiers played at the stadium through 1964, after which they were renamed the Seattle Angels, but continued to play at Sick's through 1968. In 1946, the stadium was briefly the home of the Seattle Steelheads of the short-lived West Coast Baseball Association Negro League, who played at the stadium while the Rainiers were on the road.\n\nAfter Emil Sick died in 1964, and various members of his family shared ownership, the name of the park was changed to reflect that fact, from the singular possessive form \"Sick's Stadium\" to the plural possessive form \"Sicks' Stadium\".\n\nThe city bought the stadium in 1965, in anticipation that part of the property was needed for a proposed freeway.\n\nThe field alignment was southeast, home plate to center field, which results in difficult visibility conditions for the left side of the defense in the early evening hours. The recommended alignment is east-northeast. \n\nOn April 11, 1969, Major League Baseball came to Seattle with the American League expansion Seattle Pilots debuting at Sick's Stadium. Seattle had been mentioned several times as a prospective major league city. The Cleveland Indians almost moved there in the early 1960s, but owner William Daley decided against it because he did not think that Sick's Stadium was suitable for a major league team. Charlie Finley considered moving the Kansas City Athletics to Seattle in 1967, but when he came to scout out Sick's Stadium, he quipped that it was aptly named. He advised Seattle officials to get a new stadium if it wanted a major league team. When the American League granted the franchise in October 1967, it explicitly stated that Sick's Stadium was not suitable as a major league facility, and was only to be used on a temporary basis until a domed stadium could be completed.\n\nIt soon became obvious why Daley (who bought a stake in the Pilots) and Finley were wary about Sick's. The franchise agreement required the Pilots to expand Sick's Stadium to 30,000 seats by the start of the 1969 season. However, due to cost overruns, poor weather and other delays, only 17,000 seats were ready by opening day. Several of the 17,150 people who showed up had to wait three innings to take their seats because workers were still putting them together by the time of the first pitch. In the Pilots' defense, original plans called for them to begin play in 1971. However, the date was moved up two years when Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri demanded that the Pilots' expansion brethren, the Kansas City Royals, be ready for play in 1969. Professional baseball had been played in Kansas City in one form or another from until the A's left for Oakland after the 1967 season, and Symington would not accept the prospect of Kansas City having to wait three years for baseball to return. This forced Seattle to start play in 1969 as well in order to balance the schedule.\n\nThe stadium expanded to 25,000 seats by June, but many of those seats had obstructed views. There were no field-level camera pits, so photographers had to set up their equipment atop the grandstand roof. The clubhouse facilities were second-class. Also, no upgrades were made to the stadium's piping, resulting in almost nonexistent water pressure after the seventh inning, especially when crowds exceeded 10,000. This forced players to shower in their hotel rooms or at home after the game. The visiting team's announcers couldn't see any plays along third base or left field. The Pilots had to place a mirror in the press box, and the visiting announcers had to look into it and \"refract\" plays in those areas. By the middle of the season, it was obvious that Sick's Stadium was completely inadequate even for temporary use.\n\nUnder the circumstances, only 678,000 fans came to see the Pilots, 20th out of 24 teams — a major reason why the team was forced into bankruptcy after only one season. Despite the poor stadium conditions, the ticket prices were among the highest in the major leagues. The team was sold out of bankruptcy court to a Milwaukee-based group on March 31, and the team moved at the end of spring training for the 1970 season and became the Milwaukee Brewers (Milwaukee had lost the Braves to Atlanta after the 1965 season).\n\nThough Sick's Stadium was primarily a baseball venue, it also occasionally held other events, including rock concerts — most famously, an Elvis Presley concert on September 1, 1957 (one of the first concerts to be held at a major outdoor stadium), which was attended by a young Jimi Hendrix. The Sunday night concert followed an afternoon ball game during the Labor Day weekend. Hendrix himself later performed at the stadium in the rain on July 26, 1970, as did Janis Joplin, just months before their respective deaths.\n\nIn boxing, Floyd Patterson knocked out Olympic gold medalist Pete Rademacher in six rounds on August 22, 1957. Future heavyweight champion Sonny Liston defeated Portland's Eddie Machen in a 12-round decision at Sick's on September 7, 1960.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1976, a new Seattle Rainiers team, in the short-season Class A Northwest League, played at Sicks' to sparse audiences. The major leagues returned in 1977 with the expansion Seattle Mariners at the new Kingdome (originally approved by area voters as a condition of getting the Pilots).\n\nThe Washington Huskies baseball team used the venue during the 1973 season while their on-campus venue, Graves Field, was renovated.\n\nIn 1979, Sicks' Stadium was demolished, and an Eagle Hardware & Garden store opened there in 1992, which became a Lowe's home improvement store in 1999. The stadium site is currently marked by a sign (on the corner of Rainier and McClellan) and a replica of home plate (near the store's exit) as well as markings inside the store where the bases were. Sixty feet and six inches (18.44 m) from home plate, near the cash registers, is a circle where the mound and pitching rubber were. The store has a glass display case containing mementos of the Pilots, Rainiers, and Angels.\n\nMost of the primary assets of Sick's were bought for $60,000 in 1978 by Harry Ornest, the owner of the new Vancouver Canadians for use at Nat Bailey Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia. Another purchaser was Washington State University in Pullman, which bought bleachers, fencing, and the foul poles in 1979 to construct the new Buck Bailey Field. The bleachers didn't fit well and were later sold.\n\nSeveral dozen box seats from Sicks' Stadium were transported to Alaska and installed in Growden Memorial Park in Fairbanks, which hosts collegiate summer baseball.\n\n"}
{"id": "1893805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1893805", "title": "Slacklining", "text": "Slacklining\n\nSlacklining refers to the act of walking or balancing along a suspended length of flat webbing that is tensioned between two anchors. Slacklining is similar to slack rope walking and tightrope walking. Slacklines differ from tightwires and tightropes in the type of material used and the amount of tension applied during use. Slacklines are tensioned significantly less than tightropes or tightwires in order to create a dynamic line which will stretch and bounce like a long and narrow trampoline. Tension can be adjusted to suit the user, and different webbing may be used in various circumstances. Slacklining is popular because of its simplicity and versatility; it can be used in various environments with few components.\n\nUrbanlining or urban slacklining combines all the different styles of slacklining. It is practiced in urban areas, for example in city parks and on the streets. Most urban slackliners prefer wide lines for tricklining on the streets, but some may use narrow () lines for longline purposes or for waterlining. Also see the other sections of slackline styles below.\n\nOne type of urbanlining is timelining, where one tries to stay on a slackline for as long as possible without falling down. This takes tremendous concentration and focus of will, and is a great endurance training for postural muscles.\n\nAnother type of urbanlining is streetlining, which combines street workout power moves with the slackline's dynamic, shaky, bouncy feeling. Main focus are static handstands, super splits — hands and feet together, planche, front lever, back lever, one arm handstand and other interesting extreme moves that are evolving in street workout culture.\n\nTricklining has become the most common form of slacklining because of the easy setup of slackline kits. Tricklining is often done low to the ground but can be done on highlines as well. A great number of tricks can be done on the line, and because the sport is fairly new, there is plenty of room for new tricks. Some of the basic tricks done today are walking, walking backwards, turns, drop knee, running and jumping onto the slackline to start walking, and bounce walking. Some intermediate tricks include: Buddha sit, sitting down, lying down, cross-legged knee drop, surfing forward, surfing sideways, and jump turns, or \"180s.\" Some of the advanced tricks are: jumps, tree plants, jumping from line-to-line, 360s, butt bounces, and chest bounces. With advancements in webbing technology & tensioning systems, the limits for what can be done on a slackline are being pushed constantly. It is not uncommon to see expert slackliners incorporating flips and twists into slackline trick combinations.\n\nHighlining is slacklining at elevation above the ground or water. Many slackliners consider highlining to be the pinnacle of the sport. Highlines are commonly set up in locations that have been used or are still used for Tyrolean traverse. When rigging highlines, experienced slackers take measures to ensure that solid, redundant and equalized anchors are used to secure the line into position. Modern highline rigging typically entails a mainline of webbing, backup webbing, and either climbing rope or amsteel rope for redundancy. However, many highlines are rigged with a mainline and backup only, especially if the highline is low tension (less than ), or rigged with high quality webbing like Type 18 or MKII Spider Silk. It is also common to pad all areas of the rigging which might come in contact with abrasive surfaces. To ensure safety, most highliners wear a climbing harness or swami belt with a leash attached to the slackline itself. Leash-less, or \"free-solo\" slacklining – a term borrowed from rockclimbing – is not unheard of, however, with proponents such as Dean Potter and Andy Lewis.\n\nSlackline yoga takes traditional yoga poses and moves them to the slackline. It has been described as \"distilling the art of yogic concentration\". To balance on a piece of webbing lightly tensioned between two trees is not easy, and doing yoga poses on it is even more challenging. The practice simultaneously develops focus, dynamic balance, power, breath, core integration, flexibility, and confidence. Using standing postures, sitting postures, arm balances, kneeling postures, inversions and unique vinyasa, a skilled slackline yogi is able to create a flowing yoga practice without ever falling from the line.\n\nSlackline yoga has been covered in \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Yoga Journal\" and \"Climbing Magazine\".\n\nFreestyle slacklining (a.k.a. “rodeo slacklining\") is the art and practice of cultivating balance on a piece of rope or webbing draped slack between two anchor points, typically about apart and off the ground in the center. This type of very \"slack\" slackline provides a wide array of opportunities for both swinging and static maneuvers. A freestyle slackline has no tension in it, while both traditional slacklines and tightropes are tensioned. This slackness in the rope or webbing allows it to swing at large amplitudes and adds a different dynamic. This form of slacklining first came into popularity in 1999, through a group of students from Colby College in Waterville, Maine. It was first written about on a website called the \"Vultures Peak Center for Freestyle and Rodeo Slackline Research\" in 2004. The article \"Old Revolution — New Recognition - 3-10-04\" describes these early developments in detail.\n\nWindlining is a practice of slacklining performed in very windy conditions. Depending on the intensity of the wind, it can be difficult to remain on the line without being blown off. The sensation one experiences is like flying as the slacker must angle his body and arms in an aerodynamic manner to maintain balance.\n\nWhile rope walking has been around in one manner or another for thousands of years, the origins of modern-day slacklining is generally attributed to a young rock climber named Adam Grosowsky from southern Illinois in 1979. A then sixteen-year-old Adam, the son of the head of Southern Illinois University's Design Department, became obsessed with a photo he found in the university library with the understated caption \"Circus Performers c1890\"; the photo depicted a wire bolted low on a wall on one end and the other terminating in a wristloop held by a performer doing a one-hand handstand on the top of a flagpole with his body canted far to the opposite side counterbalancing the weight of the wire. In the middle of that wire was another performer in a handstand. Adam successfully harassed the small band of local climbers into almost believing they could reproduce this feat. They all set about learning to walk on climbing ropes, webbing, chains and low / high wires, but only Adam managed to carry through with achieving some elements of that historic circus feat, most notably being able to maintain an indefinite handstand on webbing and even getting it rocking side-to-side while in the handstand. Adam carried those bad habits to Olympia, Washington's The Evergreen State College in 1979, where he met fellow climbers Jeff Ellington and Brooke Sandahl. Adam set up his permanent heavy highwire in the woods on campus while the trio continued to perfect walking, handstands, and jump mounts on webbing. Their handstand work focused on flat climbing webbing and they also employed the dynamics and flexibility of the nylon webbing to develop all manner of other tricks, including a three-club passing (juggling) routine between two slackliners balanced simultaneously on the same line. Red Square, Evergreen's central campus plaza, was a convenient between-class practice area where they often drew crowds of spectators. Grosowsky, along with Ellington were fascinated with wirewalking history and circus culture from the start, and in 1981 performed leashless on a highline strung over a concrete floor as part of a project to recreate a traditional one-ring circus in The Evergreen State College's main performance auditorium. During this period Grosowsky, who is now a regionally well-known Northwest artist, devoted much of his lithographic art to themes involving wirewalking and circus culture. The sport blossomed within the West Coast rock climbing community, and then spread to other areas. It got attention during the 2016 Rio Olympics when slackliner Giovanna Petrucci performed on the beach at Ipanema, attracting the attention of the \"New York Times\".\n\nA professional slackliner was credited with climbing a ski lift tower in Colorado and shimmying across a cable to save a man caught by a ski lift in January 2017.\n\nHighlining was inspired by a number of highwire artists who walked steel cable up high in unique places. From 1907-1948, Mr. Ivy Baldwind of Eldorado Springs, Colorado crossed Eldorado Canyon on a high wire numerous times. His final crossing was documented on his 82nd birthday. On August 7, 1974 Philippe Petit set-up and crossed a high wire between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York. In the summer of 1983, Adam Grosowsky and Jeff Ellington set up a high wire at Yosemite's Lost Arrow Spire that was nearly high. However, neither of them were able to completely cross this line because of inadequate guying. In the autumn of 1983, inspired by Jeff and Adam's efforts, a 20-year-old Scott Balcom and 17-year-old Chris Carpenter successfully completed what is believed to be the first documented high walk on nylon webbing, instead of using cable, giving birth to what slackliners now call highlining. This first highline, referred to as The Arches, was a span about long and about above ground in Pasadena, California under the California SR 134 Freeway bridge, between two arches that spanned the trickling Arroyo Seco below. The next summer (1984), Scott Balcom set up a highline on Yosemite’s Lost Arrow Spire with the help of Darrin Carter and Chris Carpenter. Scott’s attempt, however, was unsuccessful (neither Darrin nor Chris made an attempt). On July 13, 1985, Scott Balcom returned and successfully crossed the now-famous Lost Arrow Spire highline. In June 1990, Chris Carpenter purposefully \"surfed\" a highline spanning the gap of Horsetooth Rock in Fort Collins, Colorado. In 1993, Darrin Carter became the second person to successfully cross the Lost Arrow Spire highline. In 1995, Darrin Carter performed unprotected crossings of the Lost Arrow Spire in Yosemite and The Fins, in Tucson, AZ on Mt. Lemmon highway. On July 16, 2007, Libby Sauter became the first woman to successfully cross the Lost Arrow Spire, with Jenna McLennan walking it shortly after. In 2008, Dean Potter became the first person to BASE jump from a highline at Hell Roaring Canyon in Utah. On September 10, 2011, Chris Rigby and Balance Community: Slackline Outfitters owner Jerry Miszewski established the Balance Community Highline Festival in Garden Valley, California. There has been a highline fest each month since; nine highlines are set up, ranging long for highliners from across the U.S. to come train on.\n\nThe last highline record was set by the team Slack.fr in le Cirque de Navacelles in France, the line was 1662 meters long and 334 meters high. \nIn Aiglun, France, on Tuesday, April 19, 2016 , along with Danny Menšík, set a new record for the longest slackline ever – 1020m. The highline was 600 meters high at its highest point.\n\nThe longest highline walked by a woman, with a length of 222m at 400m high was set in Hunlen Falls, in Northern British Columbia on 24 August 2016 by Mia Noblet.\n\nThe longest free solo highline was walked in Hunlen Falls, in Northern British Columbia August, 2016. At a length of 72m and 400m high, it was walked by Friedi Kühne. The longest free solo highline by a female is held by Faith Dickey, who walked a 28-meter-long highline in Ostrov, Czech Republic in August 2012. The line was 25 meters high.\n\nThe highest slackline on record was walked by Christian Schou on August 3, 2006 at Kjerag in Rogaland, Norway. The slackline was high. The project was repeated by Aleksander Mork in September 2007. \n\nThe current record for walking the highest and longest urban highline is held by professional slackliner Alexander Schulz of Germany, who walked a slackline at a height of on December 4, 2016 between the Torre BBVA Bancomer and Torre Reforma in Mexico City, Mexico. Alexander Schulz walked successfully the long slackline that was stretched over the wide avenue Paseo de la Reforma.\n\nThe longest slackline, with a length of , was walked on May 9, 2015 by Alexander Schulz in Mongolia.\n\nThe longest slackline walked by a woman, with a length of , was walked in September 2014 in Lausanne (CH) by Laetitia Gonnon.\n\n\nSlackline Straps \n\n"}

{"id": "40220513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40220513", "title": "The Varsity Polo Match", "text": "The Varsity Polo Match\n\nThe Varsity Polo Match is an annual polo match between the Oxford University Polo Club and the Cambridge University Polo Club, played between teams of four players. Historically it was known as the \"inter-University Challenge Cup\" or \"inter-Varsity polo match\". It is also known as the Oxford-Cambridge Polo Match or by a title that includes the name of its current sponsor (1982 Champagne Taittinger University matches; 1984 Krug Champagne Varsity Polo; from 2010 to 2014, the Jack Wills Varsity Polo, and from 2016 onwards the La Martina Varsity ). Members of both teams are traditionally known as Blues, with Oxford in dark blue and Cambridge in light blue.\n\nThe match is a well-established and popular fixture in the British sporting calendar with up to 5000 spectators in single years and creates an interest which a game between teams of far more seasoned players often fail to do. It usually takes place at the beginning of June at Guards Polo Club. The Varsity Match was most recently contested in June 2018, and was won by Oxford by a margin of 13 – 0. As of 2018 Oxford has won the match 63 times and Cambridge 57 times.\n\nHistorically speaking, the Varsity Polo Match is the second oldest continuing polo match with the inter-regimental match proceeding it by only 7 years. The first Varsity match was played in 1878. The event has been held annually with the exceptions of the two World Wars as well as 1894, 1900, 1960–61 and 1963. The match was originally played at Hurlingham Club, but moved to Woolmers Park as well as to Cowdray Park after World War II. From 1962 onwards, the venue for the match was decided annually, with the choice alternating with each university. Since 1994, the Varsity Match is played at Guards Polo Club.\nThe Match is played for a Challenge Cup presented by the Hurlingham Club in 1920.\n\nThe match format is extremely unusual as it is traditionally not handicapped. Teams are also mixed which is a rare opportunity amongst the Blues sports of both universities. The original conditions are as followed:\nNo player eligible who has been a member of his University for more than four years, or who has not been in residence during the term in which the match takes place. Instituted in 1878. Played generally at Hurlingham, in June. (Modern Polo, 1896)\nNo player eligible who has been a member of his University for more than four years, or who has not been in residence during the term in which the match takes place. The Cup shall be held by the winning University in each year until May 1st in the succeeding year, when it shall be returned to The Hurlingham Club. Play – 6 periods.\nThe main varsity match is preceded by a match between the two Old Blues teams. This match has a similar tradition to the Varsity Match as it is held annually and its records go back to 1879 (with major gaps in the statistic). It was known by the title Old Oxonians vs Old Cantabs. In the past, both teams helped to promote British polo not just on Varsity Day but also in other tournaments and events and were seen as one of the strongest British polo teams until World War II brought an end to that.\n\nA selection of the more frequently cited statistics includes:\n\n\na. At the call of time the score was still one goal all, so the teams met again at Hurlingham a few days later, when Cambridge won by 3 goals to 2.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5871110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5871110", "title": "Wrestling singlet", "text": "Wrestling singlet\n\nA wrestling singlet (or simply singlet) is a one-piece, tight-fitting, colored uniform, usually made of spandex/lycra, or nylon, used in amateur wrestling. The uniform is tight fitting so as not to get grasped accidentally by one's opponent, and allows the referee to see each wrestler's body clearly when awarding points or a pin. Unlike judo, it is illegal to grasp an opponent's clothing in all styles of amateur wrestling.\n\nIn most high school and college wrestling matches, the competitors wear singlets in their team colors. To designate a competitor's color for scoring purposes a red or green anklet is also worn.\n\nOutside school competition (e.g., in international wrestling: freestyle and Greco-Roman) wrestlers bring a red and a blue singlet (or reversible singlet) and are told before the match which color to wear.\n\nSinglets are also common among professional wrestlers (such as Bret Hart, Kurt Angle, and Rob Van Dam). Many of these are much more stylized than those worn by amateurs, although the use of singlets in professional wrestling has declined in the last two decades.\n\nThe singlet did not become common in college wrestling until the late 1960s and early 1970s; in fact, it had been banned by the NCAA for years. Shirtless uniforms, including trunks and tights, were common until the NCAA banned shirtless wrestling in the mid-1960s.\n\nA new style of singlet, known as a double or doublet, has recently emerged in college wrestling that covers more of the upper body. Made of the same Lycra material, this singlet has more of a t-shirt covering than the traditional thin-strap singlet more commonly worn. This type of singlet is usually worn with accompanying tight-fitting shorts. This style of singlet is currently only allowed on the college level, although there is report that some high school wrestlers use this singlet style in practice sessions.\n\nOnly with special permission are wrestlers allowed to wear a t-shirt under their singlet, most commonly for sanitary reasons involving excessive acne on the chest or back.\n\nThere are three different traditional \"cuts\" to wrestling singlets: the high cut, the FILA cut, and the low cut.\n\nThe high-cut covers most of the chest and reaches up to the under-arms on the side.\n\nThe FILA-cut is like the high cut but does not rise up as high beneath the arms.\n\nThe low-cut singlet is a revealing singlet, that allows greater range of mobility, keeps its wearer cooler, tends to be more comfortable when not on the mat (wrestlers tend to wear their singlets under their clothes nearly all day in some circumstances). The low-cut reaches down to the middle abdomen in the front, reaches down to the hips on the sides, and features a single strap that runs up the back that is very thin.\n\nLow-cut singlets can no longer be worn at the Olympics or World Championships. A high-cut or FILA-cut singlet is required for this level. Generally, low-cut singlets are not legal for high school wrestling in the United States and likely will not be legal for off-season wrestling in the near future.\n\nUnderneath the singlet, wrestlers can wear nothing, a jockstrap, compression shorts, or regular briefs. A jockstrap used to be required for youth, high school and college levels. Weigh-ins have been done traditionally with the grappler in just their jockstrap, or in the nude to make weight; however, with recent shifts in trends and with girls being allowed to join wrestling teams, youth and high school programs have changed rules requiring males to have their backsides covered, so at least wearing briefs, but not nude or in a jock. Because of this change, as well as a change in trends, jockstrap use has sharply declined in wrestling. \nDuring a telecast between the Arizona Wildcats and Washington Huskies in Seattle for ESPN commentator Bill Walton wore a Husky singlet while commentating the game. He and announcer Dave Pasch had practiced with the Washington crew team earlier that day.\n\n"}
