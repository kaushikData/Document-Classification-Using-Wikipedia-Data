All earlier rounds of the tournament had been held in 1980. The winner of the tournament would be endorsed by FIDE to challenge the reigning champion, Anatoly Karpov (Soviet Union) to a match for the title of World Chess Champion. The finalists were Viktor Korchnoi (Switzerland) and Robert Hübner (West Germany), who had qualified for the final through an 8-player match knockout tournament. The other players of the tournament were András Adorján, Tigran Petrosian, Lev Polugaevsky (Soviet Union), Lajos Portisch (Hungary), Boris Spassky (France) and Mikhail Tal (Soviet Union). Tal, Petrosian and Spassky were former World Champions. The format of the final was a 16-game match. Hübner abandoned the match after completing games 1 to 8 and partially playing, adjourning and then abandoning unfinished games 9 and 10. This made Korchnoi the winner of the Candidates Tournament. Korchnoi had 4½ points to Hübner's 3½ and had won 3 games, lost 2 games and drawn 3 games.\n\nThe World Chess Championship 1981 was a match contested from 1 October to 19 November between the defending World Champion, Karpov and the challenger, Korchnoi. The first player to gain 6 wins would be awarded the title of World Chess Champion. Like the Candidates final, the match was held in Merano. Anatoly Karpov had been FIDE's recognized World Champion since 1975, when he gained the title by forfeit from Bobby Fischer (United States). Karpov and Korchnoi had both played only one World Chess Championship match prior to 1981, a very close match against one another in 1978 which was won by Karpov (+6 -5 =21).\n\nKarpov, over 18 games, gained the required 6 wins to retain his title. Karpov won 6 games, lost 2 games and drew 10 games. Due to the decisiveness of the match, it was dubbed \"the Massacre in Merano\".\n\nThe Hoogovens tournament was held as a 13-player single round robin tournament in its customary location of Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands. Jan Timman (Netherlands) was the highest Elo-rated participant. The tournament was won jointly by Gennadi Sosonko (Netherlands) and Jan Timman, both with 8/12. Sosonko was also the only player to go unbeaten in every game. Evgeny Sveshnikov (Soviet Union) and Mark Taimanov (Soviet Union) came joint third, both with 7/12.\n\nThe Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting was held in its customary location of Dortmund, Germany. It was won by Gennady Kuzmin (Soviet Union).\n\nThe 21st and final IBM international chess tournament was held in its customary location of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It was won by Jan Timman for the second time.\n\nThe 3rd Linares International Chess Tournament was held in its customary location of Linares, Spain. It was won jointly by Anatoly Karpov and GM Larry Christiansen (United States).\n\nThe 48th and 49th USSR Chess Championship tournaments were, respectively, partially and completely held in 1981. The 48th USSR Chess Championship was held from 25 December 1980 to 21 January 1981 in Vilnius, Lithuania and was won jointly by Alexander Beliavsky and Lev Psakhis, each with 10½/17.\n\nThe 49th USSR Chess Championship was held from 27 November to 22 December 1981 in Frunze (now Bishkek), Kyrgyzstan and was won jointly by Psakhis and Garry Kasparov, each with 12½/17.\n\nThe Women's World Championship was a match held in Tbilisi, Georgia. Defending champion Maia Chiburdanidze (Soviet Union) was seeded into the final match and successfully defended the title, which she had held since 1978, against Nana Alexandria (Soviet Union).\n\nThe World Junior Chess Championship, an Under-20 tournament, was held in Mexico City. It was won by Ognjen Cvitan (Yugoslavia).\n\nThe World Youth Chess Championship (Boys) Under-16 tournament was held in Embalse, Córdoba, Argentina. It was won by Stuart Conquest (England), who was 14 years old.\n\nThere were two Elo rating lists published by FIDE covering the 1981 player ratings; these lists were published in January and July.

{"id": "2285338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285338", "title": "All Star Baseball", "text": "All Star Baseball\n\nAll Star Baseball is one of the two most popular baseball board games of the last sixty years, and has been honored as one of the fifty most influential American board games of all time. It was manufactured by Cadaco-Ellis and designed by baseball player Ethan Allen.\n\nThe game first appeared in 1941 and a special version is still sold today. It was the best-selling baseball board game of all time, and is the only such game to have been distributed through mass market channels and toy stores for any extended period of time. The annual versions of the game were discontinued in the mid-1990s due to the loss of market share to video games and greatly increased player licensing costs, but a commemorative version was issued in 2003.\n\nUnlike more simulation-focused competitors, most notably Strat-o-Matic Baseball, \"ASB\" is aimed at a younger audience and is simpler to play. The initial target audience was boys 9–12 years old. It simulates batters' performance well, but makes no attempt to model the performance of individual pitchers.\n\nNevertheless, many fans passionately bought each year's cards and collected statistics from neighborhood leagues, some amassing as many as 2,500 games worth of paper box scores and comparing those totals with the actual players' statistics.\n\nThe game board for \"ASB\" has two spinners on top of a diagram of a baseball field. A hole for a baserunner peg is cut at the location of each base. A cardboard back panel is inserted into cut-out slots in the board, displays the key to the game cards and cardboard wheels that can be turned to display the correct inning, the number of outs and the score.\n\nEach circular player card has a series of lines and numbers arranged in a circle around its center. The card is placed on a spinner, which the batting player spins. (Aficionados would spin the metal pointers with rubber bands to avoid blisters.) Once the spinner came to rest between two lines, the number for that section defined what happened to that batter.\n\nIf one or more runners were on base, the pitching player would spin the other spinner, which displayed zones that defined whether runners advanced, scored or were out on the play.\n\nSome special plays, as well as attempted steals, required the use of two special pink situation cards, which went on the pitching player's spinner and indicated the result when spun.\n\nThere were no pitching cards nor fielding cards, although pitchers' batting statistics were present on their cards. This made the game inherently less mathematically accurate than its older-audience rivals.\n\nThe chart for the meaning of each number on the cards is below. The earliest versions of \"ASB\" utilized this list:\n\nLater versions featured a simpler chart, augmented by second spins on the fielding player's side (presumably to give that player more to do), with only the \"3\" section fundamentally changed:\n\nFor the 1975 release, the batting chart was reduced to the eight possible results:\n\nAll other rules of the game match those of regular baseball.\n\nUntil about 1980 \"ASB\" had a mix of current Major League stars and Hall of Fame players. As more athletes (and their estates) asserted licensing rights over the use of their names the old-time players were dropped from the game, although a handful of individuals were included occasionally in an annual set.\n\nEach of the then current players were asked to sign off on a release form granting permission to include their batting statistics in the game. This practice continued for almost 50 years after the introduction of the game. Although a few declined, most agreed despite the fact that they were not compensated for being included.\n\nIn 1995 the game came under the MLBPA license, which made the design of the game cards more sophisticated but also added significantly to the cost of production. Since the change in its business model to absorb the MLBPA royalties Cadaco has stopped issuing regular annual updates to the game, and its publishing future remains unclear.\n\nAlthough numbers have varied, the typical \"ASB\" boxed set contained 40 player cards for early sets, and 63 player cards for later sets.\n\nDuring most of its history \"ASB\" has had annual updates of its boxed board game with new players and updated stats. During some eras Cadaco-Ellis has also sold older cards by mail, and in recent years the cards have become popular on ebay.\n\nAs part of the special 2003 commemorative version, Cadaco also issued separate individually packaged sets of player cards for an All-Star Player Pack, the 2003 Ultimate Series (New York Yankees vs. Florida Marlins) and the 2003 Fantasy Series (Boston Red Sox vs. Chicago Cubs). These held action photos to further identify them as being collectible baseball cards.\n\nThere is a significant collectors market for older cards, which are broken down into several eras (all years are approximate) as printing technology evolved:\n\nThe published 1941 game was considered only a first draft. In 1975, Cadaco did try a version with 8 categories instead of 14, but the cards were already collected by dedicated players and the re-design was abandoned by Cadaco. Despite the increases in complexity, the game was intended for boys, not adults.\n\n\n"}

Top ranked player was Hou Yifan, who won the previous three editions of the Grand Prix, but had withdrawn participation after playing in the first tournament. The overall Grand Prix was won by Chinese player Ju Wenjun, who overtok Koneru Humpy at the last tournament. Koneru Humpy thereby finished overall runner-up for the fourth time.\n\nOriginally the Grand Prix was scheduled as a 4-event tour. However, at the March 2016 FIDE Presidential Board meeting, a fifth event was then added, which replaced the Women's Knockout championship. Sixteen women were selected to compete in these tournaments, though with the expansion the total became twenty, along with extras to replace the withdrawn Hou Yifan. Each player agrees to a contract to participate in exactly three of these tournaments. The players must rank their preference of tournaments once the final list of host cities is announced and the dates are allocated to each host city.\n\nEach tournament is a 12-player, single round-robin tournament. In each round players score 1 point for a win, ½ point for a draw and 0 for a loss. Grand Prix points were then allocated according to each player's standing in the tournament: 160 grand prix points for first place, 130 for second place, 110 for third place, and then 90 down to 10 points by increments of 10. In case of a tie in points the Grand Prix points are shared evenly by the tied players.\n\nPlayers only count their three best tournament results. The player with the most Grand Prix points is the winner. FIDE reserved the right to change locations and dates and increase the tournaments to six (6) and players to eighteen (18), each player in four (4) tournaments. Eventually they expanded the Grand Prix but not in the contractual manner specified, deciding to add a fifth stop at their Moscow presidential meeting (March 2016), with approximately 20 players in all taking part, keeping 3 tournaments per player.\n\nPlayers invited base on qualifying criteria were:\n\nIn May, 2016, Hou Yifan announced that she was dropping out of the Women's Grand Prix because she disagrees with the process of determining the Women's World Champion. FIDE has kept every second Women’s World Championship as a 64-player knockout tournament since 2010, which Hou characterized as a \"lottery.\" The winner of the knockout is the Women's World Champion, and then plays the overall winner of the Grand Prix. Hou believes that as the current World Champion she should defend her title against a challenger (as the Men's World Championship is decided), rather than playing in qualifying tournaments and then having to play against the winner of the knockout tournament. Alternatively, under the current setup, if she wins both the knockout tournament and the Grand Prix, she would have to play the woman who took second place in the Grand Prix for the title. In the 2013-2014 cycle, Hou was unable to play in the knockout tournament because she had already committed to play in another venue when the knockout tournament was scheduled; therefore, she lost her title to Mariya Muzychuk temporarily and regained it in a match in 2016 (delayed from 2015). Hou also said she will not be playing in the knockout tournament in this cycle.\n\nThe prize money for the single tournaments and the overall series stayed the same as the previous year, that is €60,000 per single Grand Prix and €90,000 for the overall Grand Prix finish.\nWith the objective of determining a clear, single winner to play in the Challenger Match and in the case of the top two or more players having equal cumulative points, the following criteria (in descending order) will be utilized to decide the overall winner:\n\nLike the men's Grand Prix, the number of tournaments were reduced, here from six to five.\n\nSarasadat Khademalsharieh achieved a 9-game GM norm, her first one.\n\nAt the third tournament it was mentioned top ranked Hou Yifan had withdrawn from the Grand-Prix. Koneru Humpy was leading the table after four tournaments. After winning in the tenth round of the last tournament, Ju Wenjun secured the overall Grand Prix win.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1070567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1070567", "title": "Home advantage", "text": "Home advantage\n\nIn team sports, the term home advantage – also called home ground, home field, home-field advantage, home court, home-court advantage, defender's advantage or home-ice advantage – describes the benefit that the home team is said to gain over the visiting team. This benefit has been attributed to psychological effects supporting fans have on the competitors or referees; to psychological or physiological advantages of playing near home in familiar situations; to the disadvantages away teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and, in some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly. In baseball, in particular, the difference may also be the result of the home team having been assembled to take advantage of the idiosyncrasies of the home ballpark, such as the distances to the outfield walls; most other sports are played in standardized venues.\n\nThe term is also widely used in \"best-of\" playoff formats (e.g., best-of-seven) as being given to the team that is scheduled to play one more game at home than their opponent if all necessary games are played.\n\nIn many sports, such designations may also apply to games played at a neutral site; as the rules of various sports make different provisions for home and visiting teams. In baseball, for instance, the team designated the home team bats second in each inning, whereas the \"visiting\" team bats first.\n\nIn most team sports, the home or hosting team is considered to have a significant advantage over the visitors. Due to this, many important games (such as playoff or elimination matches) in many sports have special rules for determining what match is played where. In association football, matches with two legs, one game played in each team's \"home\", are common. It is also common to hold important games at a neutral site, such as the Super Bowl, in which the location is determined years in advance. In many team sports in North America (including baseball, basketball, and ice hockey), playoff series are often held with a nearly equal number of games at each team's site. However, as it is usually beneficial to have an odd number of matches in a series (to prevent ties), the final home game is often awarded to the team that had the most success over the regular season.\n\nAn example is UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League home and away legs, with weaker teams often beating the favourites when playing at home. The World Cup victories of Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934), England (1966), Germany (1974), Argentina (1978) and France (1998) are all in part attributed to the fact that the World Cup was held in the winner's country. A 2006 study by \"The Times\" found that in the English Premiership, a home team can be expected to score 37.29% more goals than the away team, though this changes depending on the quality of the teams involved. Others have suggested that the increase in British medals during the 2012 Olympics may have been impacted by home court advantage. (However, having home court did not help Canada at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, the only Summer Games at which the hosting country failed to win a single gold medal.)\n\nThe strength of the home advantage varies for different sports, regions, seasons, and divisions. For all sports, it seems to be strongest in the early period after the creation of a new league. The effect seems to have become somewhat weaker in some sports in recent decades.\n\nAdams & Kupper (1994) described home-field advantage as an expertise deficiency. They demonstrated that, in theory and in practice, home-field advantage decreases as superiority of performance increases. They also showed that home-field advantage is not applicable for no-hit major league baseball games for pitchers who either replicated performance by winning two or more no-hitters or amassed a large number of career wins. Their general finding was that home-field advantage is a metric for the inability to maintain performance independent of environment and that this metric is inversely related to variables of expertise.\n\nIn recognition of the difficulty in winning away matches, cup competitions in association football often invoke the away goals rule. Away goals can also sometimes be used to separate teams level on points and goal difference in league competitions.\n\nThere are many causes that attribute to home advantage, such as crowd involvement, travel considerations, and environmental factors. The most commonly cited factors of home advantage are usually factors which are difficult to measure and so even their existence is debated. Most of these are psychological in nature: the home teams are familiar with the playing venue; they can lodge in their homes, rather than in a hotel, and so have less far to travel before the game; and they have the psychological support of the home fans.\n\nOther factors, however, are easier to detect and can have noticeable effects on the outcome of the game. In American football, for instance, the crowd often makes as much noise as it can when the visiting team is about to run a play. That can make it very difficult for the visiting team's quarterback to call audible play changes, or for any player to hear the snap count. In contrast, the crowd is often quiet while the home team is on offense, and that enables the quarterback to use the hard count intended to draw the defense offsides as the defense can hear the hard count. In basketball, when a visiting player is making a free throw, home fans behind the backboard typically wave their arms or other objects in an attempt to break the visiting player's focus on making the shot. Environmental factors such as weather and altitude are easy to measure, yet their effects are debatable, as both teams have to play in the same conditions; but the home team may be more acclimated to local conditions with difficult environments, such as extremely warm or cold weather, or high altitude (such as the case of Denver teams, as well as the Mexico national football team, many of whose home matches are played in Mexico City).\n\nThe stadium or arena will typically be filled with home supporters, who are sometimes described as being as valuable as an extra player for the home team. The home fans can sometimes create a psychological lift by cheering loudly for their team when good things happen in the game. The home crowd can also intimidate visiting players by booing, whistling, or heckling. Generally the home fans vastly outnumber the visiting team's supporters. While some visiting fans may travel to attend the game, home team fans will generally have better access to tickets and easier transport to the event, thus in most cases they outnumber the visitors' fans (although in local derbies and crosstown rivalries this may not always be the case). In some sports, such as association football, sections of the stadium will be reserved for supporters of one team or the other (to prevent fan violence) but the home team's fans will have the bulk of the seating available to them. In addition, stadium/arena light shows, sound effects, fireworks, cheerleaders, and other means to enliven the crowd will be in support of the home team. Stadium announcers in many sports will emphasize the home team's goals and lineup to excite the crowd.\n\nRyan Boyko, a research assistant in the Department of Psychology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, studied 5,000 English Premier League games from 1992 to 2006, to discern any officiating bias and the influence of home crowds. The data was published in the \"Journal of Sports Sciences\" and suggested that for every additional 10,000 people attending, home team advantage increased by 0.1 goals. Additionally, his study proved what many football fans already suspect: that home teams are likely to be awarded more penalty kicks, but crucially, this is more likely with inexperienced referees. So, consideration of referee profiles should clearly be a refinement for home field advantage statistics.\n\nFurther, home players can be accustomed to peculiar environmental conditions of their home area. The city of Denver, being a mile (1609 m) above sea level, has thinner air, enough so that it affects the stamina of athletes whose bodies are not used to it. Although baseball is less aerobically demanding than many other sports, high altitude affects that sport's game play in several important ways. Denver's combination of altitude and a semi-arid climate (the city averages only about 16 in/400 mm precipitation annually) allows fly balls to travel about 10% farther than at sea level, and also slightly reduces the ability of a pitcher to throw an effective breaking ball. The low humidity also causes baseballs to dry out, making it harder for pitchers to grip them and further reducing their ability to throw breaking balls. Consequently, the Colorado Rockies have a very large home advantage, with a 30% better home than away record. This anomaly has been countered with Colorado's innovative use of humidors to keep the baseballs from drying out. Denver's altitude advantage has also come into play in gridiron football; the longest field goal in National Football League history took place in Denver, as did the longest recorded punt. The national association football team of Bolivia also enjoys the advantage of playing at high altitude: at home during World Cup qualifiers at the even more extreme 3,600 m (11,800 ft) altitude of La Paz they have even been known to beat Brazil, a team regularly ranked number one in the FIFA World Rankings. More recently, Bolivia beat Argentina, who were ranked sixth in the world, 6–1 on April 1, 2009, Argentina's heaviest defeat since 1958. In cricket, the condition of the pitch and the behaviour of the ball when it bounces off the pitch varies significantly in different parts of the world, and consequently the players on the visiting team must adjust to the ball behaving in an unfamiliar way to be successful on foreign surfaces; additionally, the home team has the right to adjust the preparation of its pitches in a manner which specifically exacerbates its own strengths or its opponent's weaknesses.\n\nThe weather can also play a major factor. For example, the February average temperature minimum in Tel Aviv, Israel is , while the average at the same time in Kazan, Russia is , with snow being common. This means that when Rubin Kazan played at home to Hapoel Tel Aviv in the 2009-10 UEFA Europa League, Hapoel needed to acclimatize and were therefore at a disadvantage. Hapoel duly lost the match 3-0. This advantage, however, can also be a disadvantage to the home team, as weather conditions can impede the home team as much as the visitors: the Buffalo Bills, whose home stadium (New Era Field) is subject to high and unpredictable winds and lake-effect snow in the late fall and early winter, regularly suffer large numbers of injuries late in the season.\n\nSometimes the unique attributes of a stadium create a home-field advantage. The unique off-white Teflon-coated roof of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome trapped and reflected noise to such an extent that it was distracting or even harmful. This, combined with the color of the roof, caused opposing baseball players to commit more errors in the Dome than in other ballparks. While this is no longer an issue for opponents of the Minnesota Twins with that team's 2010 move to the open-air Target Field, it remained important to the many college baseball teams that played games in the Dome until its late 2013 closing. The parquet floor at the Boston Celtics' former home of Boston Garden contained many defects, which were said to give the Celtics, who were more likely to be familiar with the playing surface, an advantage. During the 1985–1986 season, the Larry Bird-led Celtics posted a home court record of 40-1; this record still stands in the NBA. Memorial Gymnasium, the venue for men's and women's basketball at Vanderbilt University, was built in 1952 with the team benches at the ends of the court instead of along one of the sidelines, a setup that was not unusual at the time. However, the configuration is now unique in U.S. major-college sports, and has been said to give Vandy an edge because opposing coaches are not used to directing their teams from the baseline. Cherry Hill Arena, a New Jersey-based arena in the southern suburbs of Philadelphia, had a number of idiosyncrasies that its home teams used to their advantage but earned the arena an extremely poor reputation, including a slanted ice surface that forced opponents to skate the majority of the game uphill and lack of showers for the visiting team.\n\n\"Sports Illustrated\", in a 17 January 2011 article, reported that home crowds, rigor of travel for visiting teams, scheduling, and unique home field characteristics, \"were not\" factors in giving home teams an advantage. The journal concluded that it was favorable treatment by game officials and referees that conferred advantages on home teams. They stated that sports officials are unwittingly and psychologically influenced by home crowds and the influence is significant enough to effect the outcomes of sporting events in favor of the home team.\n\nOther research has found that crowd support, travel fatigue, geographical distance, pitch familiarity, and referee bias do not have a strong effect when each factor is considered alone suggesting that it is the combination of several different factors that creates the overall home advantage effect. An evolutionary psychology explanation for the home advantage effect refers to observed behavioral and physiological responses in animals when they are defending their home territory against intruders. This causes a rise in aggression and testosterone levels in the defenders. A similar effect has been observed in football with testosterone levels being significantly higher in home games than in away games. Goalkeepers, the last line of defense, have particularly strong testosterone changes when playing against a bitter rival as compared to a training season. How testosterone may influence results is unclear but may include cognitive effects such as motivation and physiological effects such as reaction time.\n\nAn extreme example of home advantage was the 2013 Nigeria Premier League; each of the 20 teams lost at most 3 of 19 home matches and won at most 3 of 19 away matches. Paul Doyle ascribed this to visiting teams' facing \"violent crowds, questionable refereeing and [...] [a]rriving just before kick-off after long road trips, often on hazardous surfaces\".\n\nIn ice hockey, there are at least three distinct rule-related advantages for the home team. The first is referred to as \"last change\", where during stoppages of play, the home team is allowed to make player substitutions after the visiting team does. This allows the home team to obtain favorable player matchups. This rule makes the home team designation important even in games played on neutral ice. Traditionally, the second advantage was that when lining up for the face-off, the away team's centre always had to place his stick on the ice before the centre of the home team. However, in both the NHL and international rule sets, this now applies only for face-offs at the centre-ice spot; when a face-off takes place anywhere else on the ice, the defending centre has to place his stick first. The centre who is allowed to place his stick last gains the ability to time the face-off better and gives him greater odds of winning it. The third advantage is that the home team has the benefit of choosing whether to take the first or second attempt in a shootout.\n\nIn baseball, the home team gets to bat last in each inning. If the game goes into extra innings, this can yield very real advantages when deciding strategies regarding base-stealing and sacrifice hits. In addition, in Major League Baseball, the home league's rules concerning the designated hitter (DH) are followed during interleague games, including the World Series. This puts AL teams at a disadvantage when they play in NL parks, as AL pitchers are typically not used to having to bat. NL teams at AL parks are at a disadvantage because a player who does not play often will have to bat an entire game, usually on consecutive nights. The NL team's DH is a pinch-hitter who bats perhaps once every two or three games during the season, or alternates in a platoon system with other players (such as a catcher who does not start because the starting pitcher uses the other catcher), while the AL team's DH bats three or more times a game throughout the season.\n\nIn baseball, there is always a psychological home advantage when the game is tied or close in the 9th or in extra innings. The visiting team, if they are leading after batting in their half of the inning (the top), must face and record three outs against the home team in order to finish off and win the game. But the home team, upon scoring the go-ahead run in the bottom of the 9th or an extra inning, wins in sudden death without having to take the field defensively following their period at bat. If the home team is in the lead following the top of the 9th, the game ends at this point, and the bottom of the 9th is not played at all. There is no clear-cut, \"physical\" advantage because both teams are given the same number of opportunities (i.e. innings). The advantage is knowing how well one must perform in the last inning, if at all.\n\nFor games at home, the hosting team will have the advantage of playing with their first choice uniform/kit, rather than their alternate colors. A team's identity is often partly or mostly based on its home colors (for example, the All Blacks of New Zealand). In Major League Baseball, by tradition a team's home uniform has the team name on it (i.e. \"Twins\", \"Mets\", \"Braves\") and is typically white in color, while its away uniform has the name of its home city, state or region on it (\"Minnesota\", \"New York\", \"Atlanta\") and is grey or is the \"dark\" jersey (features the team's colors), although there are exceptions.\n\nA rule in American high school football (except Massachusetts and Texas, which play by NCAA rules) requiring the home team to wear dark jerseys and the visiting team to wear white jerseys may work as a \"disadvantage \"to the home team in hot-weather games.\n\nMeasuring the home-field advantage of a team (in a league with balanced schedule) requires to determine number of opponents for which the result at home-field was better (formula_1), same (formula_2), and worse (formula_3). Goals scored and conceded – in so called \"combined measure of home team advantage\" – are used to determine which results are better, same, and which are worse. Given two results between teams formula_4 and formula_5, formula_6 played at formula_4's field and formula_8played at formula_5's field, we can compute differences in scores (e.g. from formula_4's point of view): formula_11and formula_12. Team formula_4 played better at home field if formula_14, and formula_4 played better at away field if formula_16 (for example, if Arsenal won 3–1 at home against Chelsea, i.e. formula_17, and Arsenal won 3–0 at Chelsea, i.e. formula_18, then the result for Arsenal at home was worse). Same approach has to be used for all opponents in one season to obtain formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3.\n\nValues of formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 are used to estimate probabilities as formula_25, where formula_26 is total number of opponents in a league (this is Bayesian estimator). To test hypothesis that home-field advantage is statistically significant we can compute formula_27, where formula_28 is incomplete gamma function. For example, Newcastle in 2015/2016 English Premier League season recorded better result at home field for 13 opponents, same result with 4 opponents, and worse result for two opponents; therefore formula_29 and hypothesis about home team advantage can be accepted. This procedure was introduced and applied by Marek and Vávra (2017) on English Premier League seasons 1992/1993 – 2015/2016.\n\nMarek and Vávra (2018) described procedure which allows to use observed counts of combined measure of home team advantage (formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3) in two leagues to be compared by the \"test for homogeneity of parallel samples\" (for the test see Rao (2002)). The second proposed approach is based on distance between estimated probability description of home team advantage in two leagues ( formula_33) which can be measured by Jeffrey divergence (a symmetric version of Kulback-Leibler distance). They tested five top level English football leagues and two top level Spanish leagues between 2007/2008 and 2016/2017 season. The main result is that home team advantage in Spain is stronger. Spanish La Liga has the strongest home team advantage and English football league two has the lowest home team advantage among analysed leagues.\n\nDuring the regular season for a sport, in the interest of fairness, schedulers try to ensure that each team plays an equal number of home and away games. Thus, having home-field advantage for any particular regular-season game is largely due to random chance. (This is only true for fully organized leagues with structured schedules; for a counterexample, college football schedules often have an imbalance in which the most successful and largest teams can negotiate more home appearances than mid-majors, a situation that was also prevalent in the early, disorganized years of the National Football League).\n\nHowever, in the playoffs, home advantage is usually given to the team with the higher seed (which may or may not have the better record), as is case in the NFL, MLB, and NHL playoffs. One exception to this was MLB's World Series, which between 2003 and 2016, awarded home-field advantage to the team representing the league which won the All-Star Game that year, to help raise interest in the All-Star Game after a tie in 2002 (before 2003, home-field advantage alternated each year between the National League and the American League). The NBA is the only league that has home-court advantage based solely on which team has the best record (using various tiebreakers to settle the question should the teams finish with identical records). \n\nRugby union's European Rugby Champions Cup also uses a seeding system to determine home advantage in the quarterfinals (though not in the semifinals, where the nominal \"home\" teams are determined by a blind draw).\n\nIn many sports, playoffs consist of a 'series' of games played between two teams. These series are usually a best-of-5 or best-of-7 format, where the first team to win 3 or 4 games, respectively, wins the playoff. Since these best-of series always involve an odd number of games, it is impossible to guarantee that an equal number of games will be played at each team's home venue. As a result, one team must be scheduled to have one more home game than the other. This team is said to have home-field advantage for that playoff series.\n\nDuring the course of these playoff series, however, sports announcers or columnists will sometimes mention a team \"gaining\" or \"losing\" home-field advantage. This can happen after a visiting team has just won a game in the series. In playoff series format, the home-field advantage is said to exist for whichever team would win the series \"if\" all remaining games in the series are won by the home team \"for that game\". Therefore, it is possible for a visiting team to win a game and, hence, gain home-field advantage. This is somewhat similar to the concept of losing serve in tennis.\n\nAs an example, suppose that the San Francisco Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers are about to play a best-of-seven series against each other. Four games will be played in San Francisco, while three will be played in Los Angeles. If the home team were to win each game, then the Giants would win four games, the Dodgers would win three games, and the Giants would win the series, so we say that San Francisco has the home-field advantage. However, suppose that the first game is played at the Giants' park and the visiting Dodgers win. Los Angeles now has one win, and there are three games remaining at each park. If the home team wins each of the remaining games, then the Dodgers will have won four games, while San Francisco will have won two (the last game at San Francisco would be omitted, as even if the Giants won, they'd still lose 4 games to 3). Since the Los Angeles Dodgers would win the series in such a scenario, it is said that they have taken home-field advantage away from the San Francisco Giants.\n\nIn some cup competitions, (for example the FA Cup in all rounds prior to the semi-final), home advantage is determined by a random drawing. However, if the initial match is drawn (tied), home advantage for the replay is given to the other team.\n\nFor certain sporting events, home advantage may be removed by use of a neutral venue. This may be a national stadium that is not a home stadium to any club (for example Wembley Stadium hosts the FA Cup Final and semi-finals). Alternatively the neutral venue may be the home stadium of another club, such as was used historically to stage FA Cup semi-finals.\n\nIf the venue is chosen before the start of the competition however, it is still possible for one team to gain home field advantage. For example, in the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, there have been four instances where a club has managed to reach the final hosted in its own stadium (1957, 1965, 1984, and 2012). Most recently Bayern Munich played (and lost) the 2012 final at their home stadium of Allianz Arena, as it was chosen as the venue in January 2010. In the Champions League Final, however, if the \"home\" shirt colors of both teams conflict (e.g. both are red) then there is a draw which assigns one of the teams their \"away\" shirt. Not unlike the UEFA Champions League, the NFL's Super Bowl is played in a venue chosen years in advance of the game. It is possible for a team to reach the Super Bowl when it is played in their home stadium; this has never happened in the history of the game, though two games (XIV in 1980 and XIX in 1985) were played in neutral stadiums in the market area of one of the participating teams. Tickets are allocated equally between both competing teams in the Final, even if one side happens to be the home team.\n\nNeutral-venue matches may arise out of necessity. For example, on December 12, 2010, the roof of the Minnesota Vikings' stadium, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome collapsed due to a snowstorm. The Vikings were supposed to play against the New York Giants at the stadium the next day. The game was moved to the Detroit Lions' stadium, Ford Field. The following week, the Vikings' \"Monday Night Football\" game against the Chicago Bears was moved to the University of Minnesota's TCF Bank Stadium. \n\nFor the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons, the National Hockey League scheduled neutral site games. Each team played 41 home games, 41 road games, and 2 games at neutral sites (for a total of 84 games). The neutral site games were eliminated starting with the 1995–96 season, which reduced the regular season to 82 games per team.\n\nA requirement to play home matches at a neutral venue has been used as a punishment by UEFA for teams whose fans cause disturbances at a previous match. For example, after the violent clashes after the Turkey-Switzerland game in 2005, UEFA punished the Turkish team with playing the next six regular international home matches abroad. It is also required where one team's home location is in a war zone or at high risk of terrorism. In these cases the match is still treated as a \"home\" match for such purposes as implementing the away goals rule. For example, the Ukraine-Kosovo qualifier game for the 2018 World Championships was held in Krakow, Poland, because the Ukraine does not recognize Kosovo and does not admit Kosovar nationals to its territory.\n\nIn the 2018 Major League Baseball regular season, the home team won 1,277 games (52.6%), and the away team won 1,149 games (47.4%). These totals include the season's two tiebreaker games, which are officially counted as part of the regular season, but do not include the six games played at neutral sites (though all of the neutral-site games had a designated home team).\n\n\nIn the 2017–18 NBA regular season, the home team won 712 games (58%), and the away team won 518 games (42%).\n\n\nIn the 2016–17 Premier League, the home team won 187 matches (49%), the away team won 109 matches (29%), and teams drew in 84 matches (22%).\n\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n"}

{"id": "882607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=882607", "title": "Kickball", "text": "Kickball\n\nKickball (also known as soccer baseball in most of Canada) is a game and league game, similar to baseball, invented in the United States by Nicholas C Seuss. As in baseball, one team tries to score by having its players return a ball from home base to the field and then circle the bases; while the other team tries to stop them by tagging them \"out\" with the ball before they can return to the home base. Instead of hitting a small, hard ball with a bat, players kick an inflated rubber ball; this makes it more accessible to young children. As in baseball, teams alternate half-innings. The team with the most runs after a predefined number of innings wins.\n\nKickball is a popular playground game and is typically played among young, school-age children. The lack of both specialized equipment and highly skill-based positions (like pitcher) makes the game an accessible introduction to other sports. It is just as popular among adults, who are more commonly known to play similar games like softball and baseball.\n\n\"The game seems to afford equal enjoyment to the children and it gives a better understanding of the national game (Baseball), and at the same time affords them an exercise that is not too violent and is full of fun.\"\n\nKickball, originally called \"Kick Baseball\", was invented as early as 1917 by Nicholas C Seuss, Supervisor of Cincinnati Park Playgrounds in Cincinnati, Ohio. Seuss submitted his first documented overview of the game which included 12 rules and a field diagram in \"The Playground Book\", published in 1917. Kickball is referred to as \"Kick Base Ball\" and \"Kick Baseball\" in this book.\nAround 1920–1921 \"Kick Ball\" was used by physical education teachers in public schools to teach young boys and girls the basics of baseball. Around this time, the ball that was used was a soccer ball or volleyball. It was played by ten to thirty players and the field included a \"Neutral Zone\": an area not to be entered until the ball has actually been kicked. There was no pitcher as the ball would be kicked from the home area, which was a 3 ft circle. The ball must pass beyond the 5 foot line. Base-runners could only advance one base on infield balls. Teams would switch sides only after all team members have kicked.\nDuring this time, it was played on the same field as baseball except that there was only one base corresponding to a baseball diamond's 2nd base. Multiple players could be on base at a time, but all needed to get home before the last kicker kicked and the kicking order had retired.\n\nThere were also two short stop player positions: one between 1st and 2nd and the other between 2nd and 3rd. Home plate was marked by a 3 ft by 4 ft rectangle on the ground.\n\nPublished in April 1922, Daniel Chase; Supervisor of Physical Education for the New York State Department of Education, describes the earliest known account of adults playing kickball. This game took place at a conference of rural teachers in Mooers Forks, Clinton County, NY where Daniel was teaching games that the teachers could in turn teach to their pupils. They did not have a ball, so they made one out of an old stocking and some rags. The ball was about 7 to 8 inches long and tied off with an old shoelace. The construction of this makeshift ball was demonstrated to the rural teachers by Mr. Braddock Wells. The teachers were assigned numbers to create teams; odd numbers on one team and even numbers on the other. The team captains chose college names to represent each team name. The odds chose Yale & the evens chose Princeton. The game of \"Kick Baseball\" was the last game they played at the conference to decide the championship for the day. 10 players were chosen for each team and the remaining were organized into a cheering section. Yale kicked first. On the field there was no pitcher, but an extra short-stop between first and second. Only three innings were completed in the heat that day, with Yale ending up as the victor winning 3 to 2. The cheering sections showed great sportsmanship, applauding all good plays impartially.\n\nAmerican World War II correspondent Ernie Pyle reported it being played by U.S. soldiers during the Tunisia Campaign, 1942-1943.\n\n\"Kick Ball\" was promoted as an informal game for soldiers by the United States Department of the Army as early as 1943. In this variant of the game, all kicks had to be home runs, by beating the kicked ball back to home after consecutive passes to all basemen before throwing them out at home.\n\nThe game is typically played on a softball diamond with an 8.5 inch to 16 inch diameter inflated rubber ball. As in baseball/softball, the game uses 3 bases, a pitcher's mound, and a home plate. Sometimes, in less formal games, the field is not bounded by a fence as in softball or baseball, but is open. This may result in informal rule changes to accommodate the field. Also it can be played on a rectangular blacktop area with chalk or paint outlines.\n\nThe objective of kickball is to win by scoring more runs than the opposing team, thus kicking (or offensive) strategy is very important. Assuming the rules allow bunting, one popular strategy for putting runners in scoring position is to place fast kickers, particularly those with the ability to bunt the ball in specific directions, near the top of the line-up. Using this strategy, a team might put a fast player who can bunt down the third base line first in the line-up. That player would bunt down the third base line, forcing either the third baseman, the pitcher, or the catcher to field the ball and throw the runner out at first base. This is an optimal play with no outs and no players on base because throwing the ball from third to first base accurately is difficult. A well-placed bunt on the ground also removes the opportunity for the defense to catch the ball in the air for an easy out and can create fielding confusion between the third baseman, the pitcher and the catcher. The runner would then advance as far as their kick and the opposing team's defensive play allows him or her to advance. The next kicker would take stock of the base to which the first kicker has advanced and would try to kick the ball to a place that will maximize the first runner's ability to advance and the second kicker's ability to get on base safely. For instance, if the first kicker is on first base, the second kicker might also kick down the third base line. This would give both kickers a good chance of safely advancing to the next base.\n\nIdeally, a team would have runners on base and fewer than two outs once three to four kickers have kicked following this bunting strategy. At that point in the line-up, it is advantageous to place one or two kickers who can kick the ball into the outfield. The time it takes to field a ball from the outfield will ideally allow runners on base to score, even if the ball is caught in the outfield.\n\nIn the past, kickball was mostly considered a child's game in the United States, although recently many US cities have created kickball leagues only for adults. Some US cities have multiple organized leagues for adults over 21 years of age. It gained prominence in the 1970s.\n\nKickball is popular among youth in South Korea. Known as balyagu [발야구 (foot-baseball)], it is a staple in PE classes within elementary schools. Kickball is referred to as Soccer-Baseball, Chinese Baseball or California Kickball in some parts of Canada. In Japan kickball is played by elementary school students and is known as キックベース(Kickbase). In England, the variation is often played in P.E. lessons in schools and is referred to as 'Football-Rounders', a mix of Association Football and Rounders.\n\n\n"}

The gym's seating capacity was reduced from 4,200 to 500 as part of the renovation. \"McDonald Gym\" has been the home of the Lamar Lady Cardinals Volleyball Team since the renovation. The facility was named after the fourth president of Lamar Dr. F.L. McDonald. (1952-1967) The original construction cost estimate in 1957-1958 was $850,000. Chambers Construction Company of Houston, Texas was the main construction contractor.

In recent years, the Montagne Center also serves as another venue for the tournament. The tournament began in 1952.\n\nAs evidenced by the lopsided won/loss record when it was the home court for Lamar basketball, McDonald Gym was a tough place for an opponent to win. The 1968-69 season was a good example. That year, McDonald Gym was the home court of one of the more memorable seasons in Lamar Cardinals history. In addition to defeating several highly ranked NCAA Division I teams that season, Lamar defeated a previously unbeaten and sixth ranked Tulsa as well 1968 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Final Four team, Houston at McDonald Gym. That season was featured in a February 3, 1969 article in Sports Illustrated.\n\nThe men's basketball team's eighty (80) game home court winning streak started at McDonald Gym on February 18, 1978. Before the Cardinals moved to their new home at the Beaumont Civic Center, McDonald Gym saw the first thirty-seven (37) straight home wins of the streak.

{"id": "575371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=575371", "title": "Squash tennis", "text": "Squash tennis\n\nSquash tennis is an American variant of squash, but played with a ball and racquets that are closer to the equipment used for lawn tennis, and with somewhat different rules. For younger players the game offers the complexity of squash and the speed of racquetball. It also has exercise and recreational potential for older players.\n\nSquash tennis is played in various four-walled courts. The front wall (against which the ball is served) features a telltale (usually clad in tin) at the bottom couple feet from the floor, a service line about from the floor, and an out-of-bounds line around from the floor. The back wall out line is from the floor. There are two required lines on the floor: a service line about from the back wall, and a center court line running at least from the front wall to the service line. Unlike a squash racquets court, there are no service boxes. There are four types of courts:\n\nA North American squash court is . Originally designed for the related game of squash racquets, by the early 1930s the National Squash Tennis Association (NSTA) approved play on this kind of court. The dimensions are quite similar to the official squash tennis court. The only required modifications are the addition of a back wall line (in N. American squash the back wall line is from the floor) and the center court line on the floor. Temporary lines can easily be added with blue painter's tape. The problem today is that as the North American version of squash becomes less popular, new courts are not being built, and many old ones are being converted to other uses.\n\nIn 1910 the NSTA adopted a standard court size of . Although many of these were built in the New York area, after play was authorized on a N. American squash court they began to disappear. It did not make economic sense to maintain a specialty court when a more versatile one was acceptable.\n\nAn International squash court is . The additional lines will need to be added. The extra width of the court makes the various multi-walled shots more difficult or impossible, so experienced players prefer to use a N. American court. However, a court is often the only one generally available, particularly outside North America.\n\nOriginally the game was played on a racquets court, then on fives courts. Before 1911 there were no standards for court size, and ones constructed specifically for squash tennis varied from each other somewhat. They were constructed at private estates and clubs. At least one of these courts survives today in a playable condition. The court at Plum Orchard was fully restored in 2008 with the tins in place and working electric lights. It was added to George Lauder Carnegie's \"Plum Orchard\" estate on Cumberland Island, Georgia, in the winter of 1903/04, and is now owned by the National Park Service. An exhibit on squash tennis history has recently been installed in the mansion, which is occasionally open for public tours.\n\nRequired equipment is fairly simple and inexpensive: junior tennis racquets and standard lawn tennis ball. In decades past, modified tennis balls were manufactured for the game. They had higher pressure and were slightly smaller than tennis balls. The last specially manufactured ball was green, so that it could be more easily seen against white walls. Early courts had dark wood walls so that white tennis balls could be seen. Players now either use a marker to darken a yellow ball, or use colored tennis balls (such as the pink ball sold on a limited basis by Penn to raise money for breast cancer research). Blue painter's tape can be used to add the additional lines on the floor and back wall of squash racquets courts.\n\nSquash tennis is played by two players. An illustrated playing guide with rules was published by the NSTA in 1968 (see external links below).\n\nAt the beginning of the first game, a spin of the racquet is used to decide who serves first. In subsequent games of a match, the player who won the previous game serves first.\n\nThe server stands behind the floor service line, either to the left or right of the center line. Tossing the ball in the air, he strikes it with the racquet before the ball hits the ground. The service is good if the ball:\n\nThis is the major difference between squash tennis and squash racquets. In the latter sport the ball must go beyond the floor service line into the receiver's box. But it is similar to lawn tennis, as the ball is served diagonally and lands in front of the service line. In squash racquets the server also stands in toward the side wall, rather than in the center of the court.\n\nAt the beginning, the server can choose which side he starts, left or right. One fault is allowed if the ball does not go out (i.e. does not hit or go above the out lines, strikes the telltale, nor hits the floor before hitting the front wall). If the server wins the point he must then switch to the opposite side of the court (left or right) before serving again, alternating each serve.\n\nThe standard serve is a gently hit ball that strikes just below the front wall out line, comes back in a high arc, then bounces just in front of the floor service line where it meets the side wall. Slight cut will help the ball hug the wall. A high bounce along the wall is more difficult to return. The receiver cannot strike the ball before it bounces on the floor.\n\nAfter a fair serve the receiver strikes the ball so that it either directly or indirectly hits the front wall before hitting the floor a second time, goes out of bounds, or strikes the tin. Players thus alternate hitting the ball until one fails to make a fair return. The ball can only be played off the back wall if the ball first hits the back wall. A ball may hit anywhere on the back wall if it first bounces off the floor—otherwise it must stay below the back wall out line. Unintentional interference results in a \"let\"—the point is replayed.\n\nA game is played until one player reaches 15 points, except if the score first reaches 13/13 or 14/14. When 13/13 is reached, the receiver decides if the game should go to 15, 16, or 18 points. If it reaches 14/14 (without having been 13/13) the receiver decides on either 15 or 17. One does not have to win by two points. Originally only the server could score; if he lost the rally he would lose the right to serve. Current rules give the point and the serve to the winner of a rally.\n\nA match is best three out of five games.\n\nThe games of squash racquets and its parent sport, racquets, spread to America in the 1880s with the nation's first courts built at St. Paul's School, in Concord, New Hampshire. Due to a delay in shipping the proper racquets' equipment, the boys used balls and racquets for the game of lawn tennis that had also been recently introduced to the country. Even after the proper equipment arrived, some still continued to use tennis equipment on both kinds of courts.\n\nIn the 1890s both squash racquets and squash tennis had spread to adults in Boston, and play started to become more formalized. In 1898, after the construction of a court at the Tuxedo Club in Tuxedo Park, New York, squash tennis became popular among members of New York society. Private courts were built on estates owned by such millionaires as William C. Whitney, J. P. Morgan, and George Lauder Carnegie. By 1905, the Racquet and Tennis Club, Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia Clubs in Manhattan had courts, as did Brooklyn's Crescent A. C. and the Heights Casino.\n\nIn 1911 the National Squash Tennis Association was founded and organized by the banker, John W. Prentiss, Harvard Club of New York. Rules, equipment, and court dimensions became formalized.\n\nBriefly the sport gained popularity and some limited play in other cities such as Detroit, Buffalo, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, but soon squash racquets overshadowed squash tennis. But in New York City the game maintained a strong following during the 1920s and 1930s. A decision to introduce a highly pressurized ball hastened the decline of the sport. A faster ball was preferred by advanced players, but it discouraged novices. In an effort to make the game more accessible, tournament play was authorized on squash racquets courts. But for many years the sport attracted few new players. During World War II the special ball was no longer manufactured, so advanced players started to lose interest.\n\nTwo outstanding champions of the fifties were Robert Reeve and Trudy Porter. League play and tournaments continued with energy supplied by Norman F. Torrance in the 1950s. The sixties saw a revival as younger players took up the game and Jim Prigoff became National Champion and later President of the Squash Tennis Association and Richard C. \"Dick\" Squires became active when a special ball was once again available to players. Prigoff dominated the Nationals in the 1960s beating both Squires and Bacallao until he retired from the game in 1969. But competition by the new game of racquetball prevented these later attempts from making any headway with the public. The annual nationals became the only formal tournament, but became the virtual private property of two men, Pedro A. Bacallao (1969-1980, 1986) and Gary Squires (1982-1983, 1985, 1987-2000) son of Dick Squires.\n\nThe game is virtually extinct. There are no organized tournaments. The game is played on a regular basis only by about a dozen players at the Harvard Club in New York City; although longtime enthusiast Bill Rubin stated that there are a few young, very talented, new players. The NSTA has not held a meeting in several years.\n\nThe basic equipment is inexpensive, however, and for those with access to a squash court it can easily be enjoyed for its recreational and exercise value. Dick Squires published a guide to the sport in 1968. The booklet was not copyrighted, and is available online at Project Gutenberg. The guide includes pointers on how to play the game, history, rules, and a list of all national champions.\n\n\n"}

An example would be a gridiron football player throwing long passes with an empty backfield on first down in the fourth quarter of a game in which his team was already leading by a large margin.\n\nStat padding is also noticeable in online computer games. A group of players might perform a series of actions which generally require little skill in order to raise a player's statistics. For example, in first person shooters, two or more players might join different teams and constantly kill one another, usually followed by a heal, revive, or respawn. Actions such as these are usually done on password-protected or empty game servers. An example of this in the popular online computer game Battlefield 2 would be when three players collude, one as a medic, another from the other team as a killer, and another person from the medic's team, called the \"dummy\", to be the victim. The killer shoots the dummy, and the medic then heals or revives his teammate. The killer shoots the dummy again and the process continues. \n\nIt is also possible to stat pad by completing objectives or performing actions in an empty server, or by co-operating with a player on another team. While co-operating with players on another team may pad stats, this is widely considered a form of cheating.\n\n"}

That expansion continued in 1994 when lights were added. During the summer of 2001, the Field received a facelift when new turf was installed. More recently, bleachers were built into the hill closest to Barbelin Hall and on either end of the field. \n\nDuring the summer of 2008, the field was resurfaced with a FIFA approved surface called TigerTurf, and the track was completely resurfaced. The field will play host to men's and women's soccer and men's and women's lacrosse. The women's field hockey team played its last season on Finnesey Field in 2007. They open on a new playing surface on the Maguire Campus in 2009.\n\nIn 2014, the field was home field for the Philadelphia Spinners of Major League Ultimate for two games. Both games resulted in wins over the Boston Whitecaps. They were two of the highest attended games for the Spinners that season. \n\n2015 boasted a new scoreboard for the field; with added information such as player number and foul counter. The new scoreboard is located to the left of the original one.\n\nOverall, the site has seen 1,053 games entering the 2008-09 academic year, and SJU teams put together a total record of 493-518-42 in 79 years.\n"}

{"id": "19612846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19612846", "title": "Tall Story", "text": "Tall Story\n\nTall Story is a 1960 American romantic comedy film made by Warner Bros., directed by Joshua Logan and starring Anthony Perkins with Jane Fonda, in her first screen role. It is based on the 1957 novel \"The Homecoming Game\" by Howard Nemerov, which was the basis of a successful 1959 Broadway play, called \"Tall Story\", by the writing team of Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse. The film was a considerable departure from Logan's previous two projects, the drama \"Sayonara\", which won multiple Academy Awards, and the blockbuster \"South Pacific\" and was Robert Redford's first film, where he played an uncredited basketball player.\n\nThe film is a farcical social satire of American campus life, making fun of the way college life can become a marriage market for some students. Fonda portrays a character who is the complete opposite of the independent liberated woman she later personified.\n\nAt Custer University, Ray Blent is an honor student and college basketball star. June Ryder has come to the university to study home economics and to find a husband. Both students and faculty are scandalized by Ryder's unashamed pursuit of Blent. She joins the pom-pom girls and attends all the classes taken by Blent to ensure she has maximum contact with him. Everyone is aware of her designs on the sexually naive Blent, except for him. She succeeds in convincing him that she has an intelligent, inquiring mind that he admires, although this is all done through deception. She eventually gets Blent to fall for her and propose marriage. However, they need several thousand dollars to set up a home.\n\nBlent is secretly propositioned, via a radio message, by a gambling syndicate to lose a key game with a visiting Russian team. He refuses to do this, but is unable to return the money as he does not know who is behind the bribe. Rather than deliberately throw the game, he decides to deliberately fail an ethics exam, which automatically disqualifies him from playing. He is the best student in class and the only way he can fail is by copying Ryder's paper. Too late he realizes that his not playing is tantamount to ensuring his team will lose, and that he has given the gamblers exactly what they want.\n\nMeanwhile, his ethics professor, Leo Sullivan, is coming under extreme student and faculty pressure to reverse the failure and give Blent a passing grade. He refuses to do this on principle, but finally consents to give Blent an oral retest while the game is in progress. Blent passes and plays for the last few minutes, achieving a one-point victory for the school.\n\nThe film's working title was \"The Way the Ball Bounces\". Producer/director Joshua Logan originally intended the film to be a vehicle for both Jane Fonda and Warren Beatty to make their screen debuts, but Warner Bros. would not approve the unknown Beatty for the part, and Logan had to settle for his second choice, Anthony Perkins.\n\nFonda had hated the Broadway play, but was pleased that her part in the film script had been expanded. Logan was a good friend of her father, Henry Fonda, and saw Jane as a potential major star. He wanted to guide her through her first film experience – she had been modelling for several years – but Fonda found it a \"Kafkaesque nightmare,\" explaining in her autobiography \"My Life So Far\" that during the making of \"Tall Story\" she suffered from bulimia, sleepwalking and irrational fears that she was \"boring, untalented and plain.\"\n\nCampus scenes were filmed at Occidental College in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles California.\n\nOn its release in 1960, the film was neither a commercial nor a critical success. A \"Time\" magazine reviewer wrote: \"Nothing could possibly save the picture, not even the painfully personable Perkins doing his famous awkward act, not even a second-generation Fonda with a smile like her father's and legs like a chorus girl.\"\n\n\n"}

The final was won by Tan Zhongyi over Anna Muzychuk in the rapid tie-breaks.\n\nAt the FIDE General Assembly during the 42nd Chess Olympiad in Baku in September 2016, the organizational rights to the event were awarded to Iran, who held the Championship in Tehran from 10 February to 4 March 2017.\n\nSome top female players decided not to attend the tournament. Hou Yifan, the outgoing women's world champion and top ranked female player, decided not to enter the tournament because of dissatisfaction with FIDE's Women's World Championship system. The 2015 Women's World Champion, Mariya Muzychuk, and US Women's Champion Nazi Paikidze also elected not to attend, out of protest at the tournament's location in Iran, where it is mandatory for all women to wear a hijab in public (a rule which also applied to the participating players). Other notable absentees were women's world number four Humpy Koneru and seven-time US Women's Champion Irina Krush.\n\nOn 12 May 2017 FIDE suspended the Chess Federation of Iran for non-payment of Women's World Championship prizes. On 2 June 2017, the ban was lifted.\n\nThe tournament was originally placed on the FIDE calendar for October 2016. However, the March 2016 meeting of the FIDE Presidential Board ultimately postponed the event to 2017 due to a lack of organizer. \n\nThe original agenda for the General Assembly made no explicit mention of Iran, only indicating that the event had been postponed until 2017 due to the lack of an organizer, similar to the situations in 2014 and 2015. When the agenda item (5.20.7) for Women's World Championship came up for discussion in Baku, Iran offered to host the event, and after a brief discussion of the applicable dress code, none of the 159 attending delegates objected. Only when FIDE published the General Assembly decisions two weeks later the existence of the Iran offer become widely known, and the issue rapidly became explosive, in part due to the social media activity of Nigel Short, who alternatively claimed that awarding the event to Iran was against FIDE Statutes or the Code of Ethics (or founding Principles) of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nNazi Paikidze, who qualified by finishing tied for 2nd in the 2015 US Women's Championship, was the first female player to protest FIDE's decision to allow Iran to host the event. Through the media she has announced that she will not participate most particularly because of Iran's dress code requiring women to wear a hijab, though initially she also secondarily mentioned the risks to Americans and other foreigners of being detained in Iran because of their nationality. In a later petition on Change.org she included a third item, namely that there could be speech restrictions on women.\n\nChess, like other sports, has had a degree of controversy regarding women's attire. A statement from FIDE Press Officer Anastasiya Karlovich was published at Susan Polgar's site \"Chess Daily News\" on October 1, 2016, indicating that FIDE has not received any official complaints to date (including from prior women's events held in Iran), but that they would be reviewing all possible solutions for the players’ comfort and would discuss all the issues with the organizers in Iran during meetings in the next few weeks. Polgar requested that concerned participants contact the FIDE Women's Commission, of which she is co-chair. \n\nEmil Sutovsky, the president of the Association of Chess Professionals (ACP), hosted discussions at his Facebook page on the matter, and wrote an official letter to FIDE. He also noted that while he has talked to at least half the participants and the vast majority do not want to boycott, the ACP would respect the rights of others too. Natalia Zhukova, Alexandra Kosteniuk, Anna Muzychuk, and Elisabeth Paehtz have all made public comments to Sutovsky, but none to the degree of Nazi Paikidze. Sutovsky was willing to entertain Nigel Short's claims regarding the illegality of FIDE's actions, but simultaneously would not pursue them (either personally or as ACP president) until a proper legal argument was made on the matter.\n\nChessBase India interviewed two of the three qualifiers from that country (Harika Dronavalli and Humpy Koneru), each of whom has played in Iran previously. They indicated a degree of awkwardness and discomfort with the physical aspects of the headscarf while playing (as had Zhukova), but declared the World Championship itself to be more important. Later articles quoted Kosteniuk and Koneru expanding on their views, with the former noting that even exercising for fitness in Iran can be difficult for a woman.\n\n\"The Guardian\" featured 2015 Asian Women's Continental Champion Mitra Hejazipour (of Iran) in an article, describing how a boycott could harm Iranian women's sport. Other Iranian players have also stated that a boycott would not be beneficial to Iranian women.\n\nThe schedule of the tournament:\n\nThe players are selected by five different means: reaching the semi-finals of the most recent knock-out Women's World Championship, junior championships, rating, zonal or continental chess championships, and FIDE wildcards.\n\nBefore the start of the tournament, 48th seed Cristina Adela Foișor died. Because pairing were already announced, there had been no replacement.\n\nThe participants, seeded by their FIDE rating of February 2017, are:\n\nThe prize money is US$3,750 for first round losers, $5,500 for second, $8,000 for third, $12,000 for fourth, $20,000 for losing semifinalists, $30,000 for runner-up, and $60,000 for champion ($450,000 overall), with 20% of such sums being taken by FIDE. All players pay their own costs (travel, accommodation and meals) for the duration.\n\nThe final was the only match of the tournament which consists of four classical games. Those were played on consecutive days with a rest-day between the semi-final tie-breaks and match 1. Eventual tie-breaks were played on 3 March 2017, in the same manner as the whole tournament. Two rapid games of 25+10 (i.e. 25 minutes for the whole game plus 10 seconds increment), the two rapid games of 10+10, two blitz games of 5+3 and an armageddon decider.\n\nAnna Muzychuk, the reigning women's blitz and rapid world champion, had advanced to the final without playing a tie-break. Tan Zhongyi on the other hand played several, including two armageddon matches. One of those in the semi-final against Harika Dronavalli, who had been knocked-out at semi final stage for the third straight time. Before the finals, Tan Zhongyi and Anna Muzychuk had met each other just two times at classical time-control, with both games ending in a draw.\n\nAfter a draw in the first game, Tan outplayed her opponent to win game 2, however Muzychuk came back with a crushing early victory in game 3. Game 4 was a quiet draw, setting the stage for a rapid playoff. In the first pair of rapid matches, Tan Zhongyi won the title. Consequently, she was also awarded the Grandmaster title.\n\nPlayer positions are determined by the January FIDE rating list. No. 1 plays no. 64, 2 plays 63, and so on.\n\n"}
{"id": "52432503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52432503", "title": "World Forum/Communist Quiz", "text": "World Forum/Communist Quiz\n\n\"World Forum/Communist Quiz\" is a Monty Python sketch, which first aired in the 12th episode of the second season of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" on 15 December 1970. It featured four icons of Communist thought, namely Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Ché Guevara and Mao Zedong being asked quiz questions.\n\nA quiz show named \"World Forum\" is hosted by Eric Idle. He introduces his four guests, Karl Marx (played by Terry Jones), Vladimir Lenin (played by Eden Fox), Che Guevara (played by Terry Gilliam) and Mao Zedong (played by Basil Tang). Despite announcing this event as a \"unique occasion in the history of television\" the host then simply starts asking these historical figures trivial quiz questions. Marx is asked which English football team is nicknamed \"the Hammers\". He has obviously no idea (in reality it's West Ham United F.C.). Idle then asks Guevara a different question, namely in which year Coventry City FC last won the FA Cup? When Guevara also fails to give any answer at all Idle throws the question open to the other guests, but still receives no answer from any of then. Idle then says: \"Well, I'm not surprised you didn't get that. It was in fact a trick question: Coventry City have never won the FA Cup.\" With the scores all equal the second quiz round begins. Idle asks Lenin the name of the song by Teddy Johnson and Pearl Carr which won the 1959's Eurovision Song Contest. Lenin has no clue, so Idle once again throws the question open. Unexpectedly Mao rings his buzzer and gives the correct answer: \"Sing Little Birdie\".\n\nIdle then takes Marx to the \"special gift section\" of the quiz. He is able to win a beautiful lounge suite if he is able to answer all questions correctly. The host announces that Marx has chosen questions on the \"workers control of factories\" as his special subject. He asks Marx by what other development the industrial proletariat is conditioned, to which Marx correctly answers: \"The development of the industrial bourgeoisie\". Idle continues asking what kind of struggle the struggle of class against class is, to which Marx again correctly replies: \"A political struggle\". The final question however turns out to be another sports question, when Marx is asked who won the 1949 FA Cup Final? As Marx desperately tries to reply unrelated things like \"the worker's control of the means of production\" and \"the struggle of the urban proletariat\" the host informs him that he lost and that the correct answer was in fact the Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. who beat Leicester City F.C., 3-1. The broadcast closes with stock footage of a crowd cheering over a winning goal during an association football match. A caption announces that \"next week\" the four leading heads of state of the Afro-Asian Nations will be playing against Bristol Rovers at Molineux.\n\nDespite what the host says, the winning song of the 1959 Eurovision Song Contest was not \"Sing Little Birdie\", but Dutch singer Teddy Scholten's \"Een Beetje\". \n\nOn 16 May 1987, 17 years after this sketch was first broadcast, Coventry City F.C. did in fact win the 1987 FA Cup Final.\n\nThe questions asked of Marx in the \"special gift section\" of the quiz are all references to his book \"Communist Manifesto\".\n\nLater in the same \"Flying Circus\" episode, in which a sketch about the First Battle of Ypres is having difficulty getting started, the camera cuts to a quick shot of Marx and Guevara on the World Forum set, who are now kissing and embracing each other. At the end of the episode after the final credits roll, Marx & Guevara are seen in bed together.\n\nAn audio version of the sketch can be heard on the extended US version of \"Another Monty Python Record\" (1971), with live recordings released on \"Monty Python Live at Drury Lane\" (1974) and \"Monty Python Live at City Center\" (1976). \n\nThe sketch was also featured in the 1982 concert film \"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl\", where Eric Idle reprised his role as the quiz host and Terry Jones as Marx. The other roles were portrayed by different actors, though. John Cleese took on the role of Lenin, Michael Palin played Guevara and Terry Gilliam in yellowface acted as Mao. While the sketch mostly follows the same pattern as in the TV broadcast there are some notable differences. Idle's final question to the four guests is the name of Jerry Lee Lewis' biggest hit, to which Mao correctly answers \"Great Balls of Fire\", albeit in an Engrish accent. When Idle shows Marx the lounge suit he might win he adds that it is a \"beautiful non-materialistic lounge suite.\" While Marx didn't say anything after losing in the TV sketch he does react to his loss here, by using the strong language: \"Oh, shit!\" Idle also pushes him away with the aggressive order: \"Get out of here!\", then says: \"Well, no one leaves this show empty-handed, so we're gonna cut off his hands.\" \n\nThe original TV sketch was added to the compilation video \"Parrot Sketch Not Included - 20 Years of Monty Python\" (1989) and \"Monty Python's Flying Circus: Michael Palin's Personal Best\".\n\n"}
