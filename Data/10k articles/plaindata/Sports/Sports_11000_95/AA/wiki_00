India pulled out of the tournament due to political tensions with Pakistan.\n\nPakistan and Sri Lanka both played Bangladesh in the two round robin matches. A win was worth 16 or 12 points, a tie 8 points and no points were awarded for a draw or loss. In addition to this, bonus points were awarded to teams for bowling and batting performances. Pakistan and Sri Lanka qualified for the final after convincingly beating Bangladesh in Multan and Colombo, respectively.\n\nThe final was held at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan. Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 8 wickets to win the second Asian Test championship.\n\nThe 2001–02 Asian Test Championship was originally planned to include all four Asian ICC full-members (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). However, before the tournament started, India's participation was put in doubt.\n\nInitially, the BCCI requested the ACC to change the venue of the final (Dhaka) of the championship. The BCCI requested that if Bangladesh does not reach the final, the match should not be held in Dhaka, and if India and Pakistan were to meet in the final, it should be held in India, and if an India Sri Lanka final was to take place, it should be held in Sri Lanka. The BCCI stated that if the venue for the final was not changed it would be difficult for India to participate in the championship.\n\nFollowing this, the BCCI commented that India's participation in the championship and selection of the team would depend on permission from the Indian government. India's delay in confirming their participation in the championship resulted in the ACC threatening that the tournament would go ahead as scheduled without India. However the BCCI reacted strongly to the threat, claiming that \"[a] decision will be taken shortly\" and that the delay does not \"[construe] that India has pulled out of the championship\".\n\nA week before the championship was scheduled to begin, the BCCI announced that India would not participate in the tournament. This decision was reported to have been taken by the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and other government ministers after a meeting with the BCCI. It was widely understood that India's withdrawal was due to political tensions between India and Pakistan. Indian sports minister Uma Bharti stated that cricketing ties between the two countries would resume after the normalization of political Indo-Pak ties. Additionally, Indian players' security and safety in Pakistan was also noted to be the major concern.\n\nAs expected, the ACC reacted angrily over India's decision, however it was confirmed that the tournament would be rescheduled and go on with only three teams. Jagmohan Dalmiya, the chairman of the ACF, the marketing arm of the ACC, described the government's decision not to allow the Indian team to participate in the Asian Test Championship as an internal matter:\n\n\"It is purely an internal matter between the Government of India and the Indian Cricket Board. The ACC or the ACF has no jurisdiction to deal with the respective governments. I have no comment to make on the decision\"\n\nThe PCB expressed regret over India's decision not to participate in the championship. The PCB chairman, Lt. Gen. Tauqir Zia was dismayed over the Indian government's decision to go back on their commitment, which was a guarantee that India would have no objection playing multilateral tournaments which included Pakistan.\n\nIt was expected the ICC to sanction or fine the BCCI for their actions. The ACC and PCB were expected to experience a financial downfall due to India's decision. Pakistan in particular were unhappy since Pakistan's tour of India in 1999 helped raised millions of dollars in revenue for the BCCI. India had already cancelled a tour earlier in the year to Pakistan. Additionally, after the first Test, the Bangladesh Cricket Board reported that they were fearing bankruptcy due to India's withdrawal from the tournament. The director of the BCB, Ashraf-ul-Haq commented that funds that would have been generated by the ACC from the championship would be used to invest in Bangladesh cricket as well as other minor countries, without which the BCB faced serious financial problems. Ashraf planned on condemning the BCCI in the following ICC executive and ACC meetings.\n\nFormer Pakistan Test players, including Intikhab Alam, Hasib Ahsan, and Wasim Akram, accused India of withdrawing due to fear of losing to Pakistan. Tournament captains, Waqar Younis (Pakistan) and Naimur Rahman (Bangladesh) expressed India's absence as a disappointment.\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board protested the appointment of John Reid as match referee for the 1st match of the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship. John Reid had been involved in controversies involving the Pakistan team; he had fined and suspended Waqar Younis and Azhar Mahmood for ball tampering and had been involved in reporting Shoaib Akhtar's suspect bowling action to the ICC.\n\nPakistan used the precedent that Sri Lanka had successfully removed Australian umpire Darrell Hair from their matches during the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Hair had called Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing during a tour of Australia.\n\nHowever, ICC policies do not permit any member country to veto the appointment of independent referees or umpires. The ICC rejected Pakistan's formal complaint, and the ICC Chief Executive Officer Malcolm Speed assured that the PCB had confirmed that \nJohn Reid would receive the same courtesies that are extended to all ICC officials visiting Pakistan.\n\nJohn Reid did not comment on the protest, but expressed disappointment and that he was still available to go to the match and do the job he had been appointed to.\n\nWasim Akram and Mushtaq Ahmed were left out of the initial Pakistan training squad before the tournament. This was done to make room for younger players, however, Akram did feature in the first Test match but failed to record a wicket. Prior to the championship, the Pakistan Cricket Board formally announced that Richard Pybus would be the new coach of the Pakistan team for at least three series.\n\nThe scoring system used for the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship was a revised version of the first system used in the 1998-99 Asian Test Championship. The Asian Cricket Council approved the revisions brought forward by the technical committee compromising of Sunil Gavaskar (India), Zaheer Abbas(Pakistan), Ashantha De Mel (Sri Lanka) and Gazi Ashraf (Bangladesh). Points for winning the match were kept at 12, however additional points were given for an innings victory. Points for a tie were increased from 6 to 8.\n\nBonus points were awarded to teams for good bowling and batting performances (\"see table below\"). A maximum of 24 points could be gained in one match (including the 16 match winning points). The bonus bowling and batting points were confined to the first 100 overs of the first innings. The two teams with the highest number of points qualify for the final. If two teams are tied on points, the team with a better run rate in the first 100 overs will go through. If the final ends in a draw, the side with the higher bonus points will win. For the 2001–02 Championship, the bonus point system was changed, 400+ runs and 10 wickets to achieve maximum points (increased for 350+ and 9–10 from the previous championship).\n\nThe first Test match of the Championship was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It was held in Multan, at the newly renovated $2.5 million Multan Cricket Stadium. This was the first Test match to be held in Multan since 1980–81 when the West Indies drew a match with Pakistan. Being the first match in the stadium, the nature of the pitch and ground was unknown, however a result was expected.\n\nThis was the first Test match between the two sides. The previous international cricket match between the two sides was at the 1999 Cricket World Cup when Bangladesh upset Pakistan to win its first One Day International against a Test team. Bangladesh was granted Test status only 14 months prior to the championship; this was their fourth Test match, having played India once and Zimbabwe twice losing on all three occasions. Before the match, Bangladesh captain had ruled out the possibility of a repeat upset while batsmen Al Sahariar revealed that the aim for the team was to play the full five days. The Bangladesh team had engaged notable former cricketers Javed Miandad of Pakistan, Andy Roberts of West Indies and Trevor Chappell of Australia as coaches, to strengthen their side. However, monsoon weather had hampered their preparations for the tournament.\n\nFor Pakistan, Saqlain Mushtaq was left out of the side due domestic conflicts in England. Taufeeq Umar and Shoaib Malik were included in the initial 16-man squad; both players earned their first Test cap in this match. Wasim Akram, initially left out of the 27-man training squad, was included in the final 16 and 11, taking Shoaib Akhtar's place, after a positive performance in a first-class match between PCB XI and Bangladesh.\n\nPakistan entered the match as clear favorites, despite having failed to win a Test series at home since 1997, when Wasim Akram captained the side to a 3–0 whitewash over the West Indies. Since then, Pakistan has lost series against Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, England and Australia.\n\nBangladesh won the toss and elected to bat, however they made a poor start to the match, being bowled out for 134 in 41.1 overs. None of the Bangladeshi batsmen scored 20 runs, while Danish Kaneria took 6 wickets. Pakistan made a confident start to their innings, reaching 219/2 at the end of the day. Saeed Anwar top scored on the day, making 101 from 104 deliveries. He reach 4000 Test runs in this innings, joining the likes of Javed Miandad, Saleem Malik, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Zaheer Abbas and Mudassar Nazar as the only Pakistanis to do so. Pakistan ended the day with an 84 run lead with 8 wickets in hand.\n\nPakistan added to their overnight score on the 2nd day, amassing a total of 546/3 (declared), creating a 412 first innings lead. Five players scored centuries: Saeed Anwar (101), Taufeeq Umar(104), Inzamam-ul-Haq (105*), Yousuf Youhana (102*) and Abdul Razzaq (110*). Taufeeq Umar became the 8th Pakistani batsmen to score a century on debut, while Razzaq's was the second fastest century by a Pakistani (after Majid Khan). Inzamam-ul-Haq retired hurt (dehydration) when the score was at 381/3.\n\nThe five centuries in one innings equaled a world record set by Australia in 1954–55 against the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nBangladesh started their innings on the 2nd day with 19 overs remaining. They closed at 55/3 with Habibul Bashar not out on 19.\n\nPakistan won the match when Bangladesh were bowled out on the 3rd day; Man of the Match, Kaneria took 6/52 for a career best match total of 12/94. Habibul Bashar was the only batsmen to offer any resistance, scoring an unbeaten 56. The inning and 264 runs victory was the 6th largest in Test cricket history.\n\nPakistan established four unique records in the match:\n\nAdditionally, the Test match was the hottest ever, with temperatures in excess of 38 degrees Celsius (100 degree Fahrenheit) on each day.\n\nWasim Akram was criticised by the media for a poor performance in which he did not take a wicket. However skipper Waqar Younis backed Akram saying that he was unlucky with a couple of dropped chances. Bangladesh coach Trevor Chappell and captain Naimur Rahman were critical of the Tigers batting performance. Chappell also added that Kaneria did not \"deserve\" 12 wickets. After the match, it was reported that Saeed Anwar's young daughter died. This event led to his eventual move away from cricket.\n\nPakistan received the maximum 24 points for their victory; 16 for winning by an innings and 4 each for batting and bowling performances. Bangladesh received no points:\n\nThe second Test of the Championship was held at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It was the first Test between the two sides and to mark the occasion, the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) allowed free entry at five enclosures at the stadium. The BCCSL also established prize money for the match, with the winning team earning SLR 70,000, the losing team SLR 40,000 and the Man of the Match earning SLR 25,000.\n\nThis Test was the second meeting of the two sides in international cricket; Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh in an ODI during the 1997 Asia Cup. Prior to this match, Bangladesh had lost four Test matches in a row, and their coach Trevor Chappell was expecting this Test to be a learning experience for the side rather than an opportunity to win their first match. Following Bangladesh's batting collapse in the first match of the championship against Pakistan at the hands of leg spinner Danish Kaneria, Bangladesh was expected to perform better with the bat, especially against the in-form Muralitharan who took 23 wickets in 3 Tests against India.\n\nSri Lanka entered the match after a 2–1 series win over India. Sanath Jayasuriya, the Sri Lanka captain warned ahead of the game that his team can not afford to relax and was expecting good performance against the newest Test nation. Historically, Sri Lanka have had a winning record at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, with Chaminda Vaas and Muralitharan taking career bests at this venue. The pitch was not expected to deteriorate in the first three days and was assumed to support fast bowlers.\nBoth teams made changes for the match. Sri Lanka pacer Dilhara Fernando was ruled out due a groin strain and was replaced by Ravindra Pushpakumara. Additionally, under-performing batsman Russel Arnold and fast bowler Dulip Liyanage were replaced by Michael Vandort and Ruchira Perera respectively. For Bangladesh, Akram Khan and Enamul Haque were replaced by Mohammad Ashraful and Al Sahariar. This was the first Test match for Vandort and Ashraful.\n\nAfter both Pakistan and Sri Lanka defeated Bangladesh in their respective round-robin matches, the two teams agreed to play a straight final instead of their meaningless round-robin match.\n\nThe PCB and Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka agreed to play the final match at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan. It marked the return of international cricket to Pakistan after the 2001 US invasion of Afghanistan prompted the cancellation of tours by New Zealand and Sri Lanka, and the rescheduling of the West Indies series to Sharjah.\n\n"}

This was the first time that Slovakia was selected to host a Deaflympic event. But the multi-sporting event was cancelled due to the lack of preparations, lack of readiness and reluctance by the Deaflympic Committee of Slovakia prior to the event. The event was also cancelled mainly due to the alleged fraud by the former President of the Deaflympic Committee of Slovakia, Jaromir Ruda.

After two seasons of early starts to accommodate international competitions, the ANZ Championship returned to its usual format in 2012. The 2012 season comprised 69 matches played over 17 weeks, including an initial 14-week round-robin stage, followed by a three-week finals stage. The competition concluded with the grand final, held on July 22.\n\nDuring the initial round-robin stage, played over 14 weeks, each team plays every other team once, and teams from their home country a second time, with one bye somewhere between Rounds 5–12 inclusive. Teams are awarded 2 points for each win, and 0 points for a loss. Tournament rules do not allow draws; matches that are tied at the end of regular time will extend into extra time until a winner emerges. In 2012, round 6 will be the designated Rivalry Round.

The track is exactly long.\n\nIn 1939, William \"Lefty\" Goldberg and others chose Batavia, halfway between Buffalo and Rochester, for par-mutuel wagering on horse races. Harold Wishman, William Zimmer, Arthur Martin and Frederick Strohm were stockholders in the Monroe-Genesee Breeders Association, a predecessor to the Genesee-Monroe Racing Association, which rented the Genesee County Fairgrounds for racing.\n\nIn 1940, Batavia Downs opened pari-mutuel racing at 8:20 PM on September 20, 1940. Crowds of more than 2,500 attended and $10,411 was wagered on the first card.\n\nIn 1941, Batavia Downs opened to an estimated crowd of about 4,000 and a handle of $20,231. Track lighting was improved.\n\nThe season was cancelled in 1942 and 1943 because of war travel restrictions. \nIn 1944, Pat E. Provenzano borrowed money and bought out stockholder William Weisman, a New York City attorney, for $15,000. Provenzano was elected president of the Genesee Monroe Racing Association. \nIn 1947, Provenzano purchased the racetrack property for $150,000 after the Genesee County Agricultural Society's fair association went bankrupt. Proximity set the then-track record of 2:04. In 1948 she broke her own time record with a time of 1:59 3/5.\n\nIn 1959, Bye Bye Byrd beat Tar Boy and equaled the world record for a half-mile track, 159.2. Attendance for this race was 9,633.\n\nIn 1962, a fire devastated the stables, killing a caretaker, 26 horses, and causing an estimated $625,000 in damages, not including lost revenues. The Downs underwent extensive renovations to prevent fires.\nIn 1963, Batavia Downs welcomed its eight millionth visitor.\nIn 1964, the grandstand was enclosed in glass. \n\nIn 1966, Bret Hanover down under Cardigan Bay set a track record of 1:58.1. Batavia Downs enjoyed its biggest crowd at the time, as 15,228 came to watch and wagered $515,334. \n\nIn 1968, Downs General Manager Herm Grannis was elected president of Harness Tracks of America, where he established the Harness Tracks Security.

{"id": "283786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=283786", "title": "Canoe polo", "text": "Canoe polo\n\nCanoe polo, also known as Kayak polo, is one of the competitive disciplines of kayaking, known simply as \"polo\" by its aficionados. Polo combines boating and ball handling skills with a contact team game, where tactics and positional play are as important as the speed and fitness of the individual athletes.\n\nThe game requires excellent teamwork and promotes both general canoeing skills and a range of other techniques unique to the sport. Each team has five players on the pitch (and up to three substitutes), who compete to score in their opponents goal which is suspended two metres above the water. The ball can be thrown by hand, or flicked with the paddle to pass between players and shoot at the goal. Pitches can be set up in swimming pools or any stretch of flat water.\n\nThe kayaks are specifically designed for polo and are faster and lighter than typical kayaks which give them superior maneuverability. The blades of a polo paddle have thick rounded edges to prevent injury. Paddles are also very lightweight and designed with both pulling power and ball control in mind. Nose and tail boat bumpers, body protection, helmets and face-guards are all compulsory.\n\nIn International Canoe Federation nomenclature used in some European countries, chiefly the United Kingdom, the term canoe can refer to a kayak too. The boats in this game are paddled with a double-bladed paddle and are called \"kayaks\".\n\nThe birth of the modern sport could be considered to be the demonstration event held at the National Canoe Exhibition at the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, London, in 1970.\n\nIn response to the interest created at the Crystal Palace event, the first National Canoe Polo subcommittee of the British Canoe Union was formed, and it was this committee that developed the modern framework of the game. The National Championships were held every year at the National Canoe Exhibition, and this activity led on to the inclusion of Canoe Polo in the demonstration games at Duisburg, Germany in 1987.\n\nThe game is now played in many countries throughout all inhabited continents, for recreation and serious sport. The sport has World Championships every two years and European, Asian, African, and PanAmerican Continental Championships held every year in between World Championship years. Internationally the sport is organized by the Canoe Polo committee of the International Canoe Federation, as one of the disciplines of the sport of canoeing.\n\nThe game is often described as a combination of water polo, basketball and kayaking. The tactics and playing of the game are not unlike basketball or water polo but with the added complexity of the boats, which can be used to tackle an opposition player in possession of the ball, or jostle for position within 6 meters of the goal.\n\nThere are two referees (one on each side-line) and they are on foot rather than in boats. The score is kept by the scorekeeper and the timekeeper monitors the playing time and sending-off times. The goal lines are monitored by two line judges. Before play commences scrutineers check all kit for compliance with regulations.\n\nCanoe polo is played either indoors in swimming pools or outdoors on a pitch which should measure 35 meters by 23 meters. The boundaries of the pitch are ideally marked using floating ropes (similar to lane markers in swimming), although for smaller venues the edges of the pool are frequently used.\n\nThe area approximately 6 meters in front of each the goal can be defined as the Zone. This area is where defending players create formations to defend the goal from attackers.\n\nThe game is officially played as a 14- to 20-minute game consisting of two 7- to 10-minute halves. The teams change ends at the half-time period, which is 1 to 3 minutes long. Each half begins with a \"sprint\" where each team lines up against its goal-line and the ball is thrown into the middle of the pitch by the referee. One player from each team sprints to win possession of the ball.\n\nA shot clock may be used to speed up the game. The attacking team have 60 seconds to have a shot on the goal or they lose possession. The shot clock is reset when the ball is intercepted by the opposing team or the attacking team loses possession. The shot clock is a recent addition to the rules, and due to the expense and complexity of the equipment is not used universally.\n\nThere are several attacking and defensive tactics all with different variations.\n\n\n\nMost of the rules concern the safety of the players involved or are designed to keep the game fast-paced and exciting to play and watch.\n\n\nThree general principles can be applied when determining the severity of a foul.\n\nDeliberate foul – A foul where no effort was made to avoid the illegal play. Any deliberate foul should receive a minimum of a green card- either immediately or at the next break in play if playing advantage.\n\nDangerous foul – Is significant contact with the opponent's arm, head or body that may result in personal injury and is illegal.\n\nSignificant contact – Any high impact or continuous contact, that may result in equipment damage or personal injury.\n\nSpecialized equipment is needed to play Canoe polo. Items required are:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "677936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=677936", "title": "Cramton Bowl", "text": "Cramton Bowl\n\nCramton Bowl is a 25,000-seat stadium located in Montgomery, Alabama. Cramton Bowl opened in 1922 as a baseball stadium and has been home to Major League Baseball spring training, and to minor league baseball. Today, however, its primary use is for American football.\n\nIt is the host of the annual Camellia Bowl for the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, and of Montgomery's five high school squads. It was home to the Blue–Gray Football Classic, an all-star game usually played on Christmas Day, the Alabama State Hornets football team, and hosted the first ever football game played under the lights in the South.\n\nCramton Bowl is named for Fred J. Cramton, a local businessman who donated the land on which the stadium is built. After a conversation with friends about the need for a baseball stadium, Cramton donated his sanitary landfill to the city so a facility could be constructed there. The city held the land for a time and then returned it, stating that Cramton's stadium idea was too big of a project for the city to undertake. Cramton then decided to take matters into his own hands; with the help of the Junior Chamber of Commerce, Cramton raised $33,000 to build the sports venue.\n\nSeating capacity was expanded in 1929 to 7,991. More additions were made in 1946, increasing the seating capacity to 12,000. East stands were added in 1962 bringing the seating capacity up to 24,000. After new renovations were completed in July 2011 the capacity was reduced to 21,000.\n\nThe first baseball game played on the new field was in May 1922 between Auburn University and Vanderbilt University.\nShortly after its completion in 1922 the Philadelphia Athletics decided to move their spring training operations from Eagle Pass, Texas to Montgomery. They used the facility for their 1923 and 1924 spring training and exhibition games before moving to a newer stadium in Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nAfter the departure of the Philadelphia Athletics spring training, Minor League Baseball's newly formed Southeastern League placed a team in Montgomery. They became known as the Montgomery Lions. The Lions played in Cramton Bowl from 1927 to 1930. There was no team from 1931 to 1936 due to problems within the Southeastern League and the ongoing negative economic effects of the Great Depression. The team returned for the 1937 season as the Montgomery Bombers and garnered their first major league baseball affiliation with the Cleveland Indians. The Indians pulled out for the 1938 season and were replaced by the Philadelphia Phillies. After one season the Phillies dropped their affiliation; the team became a co-op franchise and were renamed the Montgomery Rebels. In 1943, the Rebels would disband due to the manpower shortage caused by World War II. On July 11 of that year, the Chattanooga Lookouts moved their home games to Cramton Bowl to play out the rest of the season. The Lookouts managed to move back to Chattanooga and reverse the trend of declining attendance sometime later in the 1940s. The Rebels returned in 1946 through 1949 before moving to the newly constructed Paterson Field located just across the street.\n\nThe eighth and deciding game of the 1943 Negro World Series was held at the Cramton Bowl, with the Homestead Grays defeating the Birmingham Black Barons, 8-4.\n\nOn September 23, 1927, Cramton Bowl became the site of the very first game played \"under the lights\" in the South with Cloverdale taking on Pike Road High School. Former superintendent D. H. \"Sarge\" Caraker remembers fondly, \"[We] used dishpans for reflectors and sent to California for the lamps. We drew 7,200 people from all over the South to see it.\"\n\nCramton Bowl was host to all home games for Alabama State Hornets football, and was the host to all of those for the Faulkner University Eagles. It was also home to the Turkey Day Classic and in 2009 hosted the inaugural HBCU All-star Bowl.\n\nCramton Bowl also provided a location for Alabama Crimson Tide football home games in the capital city. The Crimson Tide played home games at Cramton Bowl in the 1922 through 1932 seasons, in 1934, from 1944 through 1946 and again from 1951 through 1954. Alabama's all-time record at Cramton Bowl was 17 wins and 3 losses.\n\nCramton Bowl probably achieved its greatest fame as the home of the Blue–Gray Football Classic, an annual college football all-star game which was held there each December from 1938 until 2001.\n\nBeginning in 2014, Cramton Bowl began hosting the Camellia Bowl, a college football bowl game which features teams from the Sun Belt Conference and Mid-American Conference.\n\nSeveral area high schools call Cramton Bowl home including the Jeff Davis Volunteers, Lanier Poets, Lee Generals, Park Crossing High School Thunderbirds, and Carver Wolverines. In July 2011, Cramton Bowl hosted the Alabama High School Athletic Association Alabama All-Stars Sports Week football game.\n\nBy the start of the 21st century, Cramton Bowl was widely regarded as being functionally obsolete for major sporting events. The stadium's relatively small capacity was not a concern as much as its age and condition. The stadium was not well maintained for most of its history, and by the dawn of the new millennium it was actually crumbling. These issues were factors, although not the predominant ones, in the Blue-Gray Game not being held in 2002 and its subsequent relocation in 2003 to Troy University's Movie Gallery Stadium, about 50 miles (80 km) from Montgomery.\n\nIn mid-2010 the City of Montgomery approved a measure for a $10 million renovation and addition to Cramton Bowl. The renovations planned for Cramton Bowl were a unique mix of the old and the new. The old structure was revamped and updated with four entrances, a state-of-the-art press box, an aesthetically enhanced plaza area, and a \"Walk of Fame,\" which celebrates Montgomery's sports history and houses various articles of historic sports memorabilia. Perhaps the most important and impressive addition was the multi-purpose sports facility. Demolition of the north endzone and press box began in late November 2010, which was phase one of the project. Phase two began in early January 2011 as crews removed an existing brick wall from the south endzone and dismantled the scoreboard to make way for the new multi-purpose sports facility. Work on the stadium was completed in 2011 while the new multi-purpose facility was finished in 2012.\n"}

It was a six acre site on South Street backing onto Uttoxeter Old Road and cost £65,000 to build. The entrance was at the end of Vernon Street and the construction took six years to complete opening in 1827. The walls were 25 feet high enclosing three acres of land and the gaol held over 300 prisoners.\n\nIt continued to serve as a prison until 1916 but was then used as a military prison. The buildings and cells inside the boundary walls were demolished in 1929 but the curtain wall and large entrance. Within five years the Preston Greyhound Racing Association had purchased the site and built a greyhound stadium within the walls.\n\nThe company who had just opened their Preston track in May 1932 set an opening date of 29 April 1933. The first manager was Ted Rimmer (one of the famous Rimmer brothers within the industry) and facilities included two clubs, one in the grandstand and one in the popular enclosure. The first ever winner was 2-1 shot Tramore Lad over 260 yards after defeating 6-4 favourite Santober by one length in 17.31. Many of the early races were just four dog events.\n\nThe circumference of the track was 385 yards which was laid out on the former exercise yard for the prisoners, other distances were 460 and 650 yards. The onsite kennels adjacent to the track backed onto Sims Avenue; the old prison officer's quarters were now houses for the trainers, a cookhouse, storage and staff rooms.\n\nTrainer Charlie Green provided the track with their first major winner when Silver Wire won the 1939 Scurry Gold Cup at Clapton Stadium. Another track trainer Harold Broadbent looked after the greyhounds housed in the adjoining stadium kennels owned by the company and he would eventually become the head of the RSPCA. After the war a greyhound called Keepers Remorse raced a remarkable 409 times, finishing second 98 times and in 1947 the tote turnover was £452,808.\n\nRacing Managers included Lieutenant-Colonel Prior and George Turnpenny who arrived from Willenhall in the 1950s. The next milestone came in 1968 after the Pat Murphy trained Malaria won the Midland Flat Championship. During the sixties race nights were on Wednesday and Saturday evenings and facilities included three buffet bars and two licensed bars. The circuit circumference was re-measured at 378 yards. In the 1970s Barry Davis was Racing Manager and two principal events were introduced, they were the Derby Plate over 420 metres and the Derby Vase over 590 metres\n\nIn 1984 the ageing stadium was bought by Terry Corden for £300,000, Corden had taken over as General Manager in 1979. Peter Robinson was brought in as Racing Manager and the only remaining trainers housed at the track kennels were Tom Harrison and Pat Murphy following the departure of Frank Heald and Peter Corbett. Corden sold the stadium for £1 million in 1988 to JF Miller properties and Heights of Abraham Limited. Within two years the Derby City Council received a planning application for redevelopment.\n\nThe last race meeting was held on Saturday 7 December 1988 (the same year as former sister track Preston). Today the area is very smart with office buildings contained within the redeveloped area. A beautifully restored entrance called Vernon Gate still marks the entrance of the prison and greyhound stadium.\n"}

It is currently used mostly for football matches. The stadium actually holds approximately 13,000 people and was built in 1945 with the name Braden Copper Company Stadium \"(Estadio Braden Copper Co.)\". The stadium is the home stadium for O'Higgins, the team of the city of Rancagua.\n\nThe stadium hosted seven matches of 1962 FIFA World Cup, where played matches of the group stage and quarter-finals.\n\nIn 2013, the stadium was renovated for hosting the 2015 Copa América, to be played in Chile. Two matches of the group stage will be played in this stadium.\n\nThe stadium, since its construction, was owned by the U.S. copper mining company Braden Copper Company, which operated the mineral-extraction complex \"El Teniente\".\n\nThe designation of the Braden Copper Stadium to host matches in the 1962 FIFA World Cup was due to an emergency. Indeed, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake severely damaged or destroyed facilities in some of the originally-designated host cities of the FIFA World Cup in 1962 including Talca, Concepción, Talcahuano and Valdivia, which caused the original schedule to be discarded and forced its almost complete modification. Further, Antofagasta and Valparaíso were deterred from fulfilling their offers to host because they could not feasibly construct self-funded stadiums, a condition that had been imposed by the Federation due to its own lack of resources. However, given the bleak outlook for the organization, the U.S. mining interests allowed the use of their stadium in Rancagua.\n\nThe Government of Chile acquired in 1967 51% of the shares of Braden Copper Co., as part of the general nationalization of copper, which concluded in 1971. Therefore, the ownership and management of the \"Estadio Braden Copper\" passed to the state-owned coroporation Codelco Chile, which led to the name change to the current one.\n\nOn May 21, 2008, the then-president Michelle Bachelet announced the \"Red de Estadios para el Bicentenario\", a programme in which w new stadiums were built and upgrades planned for others, among which was the Estadio El Teniente. However, remodeling El Teniente was not executed during the term of Bachelet, although this was projected, due to the 2010 Chilean earthquake.\n\nOn September 2, 2012, President Sebastian Piñera announced in Rancagua the final draft of the plans for remodelling the stadium, which will have a capacity of 15 000 spectators.\n\nThe Asociación Nacional de Fútbol Profesional (ANFP) announced in December 2012 that El Teniente had been selected to host the 2015 Copa América, along with Santiago, Antofagasta, La Serena, Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, Concepción and Temuco. Host venue contested with the city of Talca, however Rancagua was chosen due to its closer proximity to the Chilean capital.\n\nIn the inaugural match, O'Higgins played against Lanús for the week 6 of the 2014 Copa Libertadores. The final result was 0–0,\nmarking the elimination of the club from the competition, as they needed a victory to advance to the next round.\n\nThe stadium has 5 sectors since her renovation, the Palco has 375 seats, and the totality of the other four sectors are 13,464.\n\nThe Estadio El Teniente hosted seven games during the 1962 FIFA World Cup, every game of Group 4 and a quarterfinal.\n\nTeams which played in this stadium for the 1962 FIFA World Cup:\n\nThe Estadio El Teniente has hosted three games of the Chile national football team, against New Zealand in 2006, Guatemala in 2008, and the United States in 2015.

{"id": "1936892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936892", "title": "Lynah Rink", "text": "Lynah Rink\n\nLynah Rink (pronounced LIE-nuh) is a 4,267-seat hockey arena at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, that opened in 1957. Named after James Lynah, Class of 1905, who was the director of Cornell athletics from 1935 to 1943, it is home to the Big Red men's and women's ice hockey teams.\nLynah has been home to hockey greats such as Ken Dryden, Joe Nieuwendyk, Matt Moulson, Digit Murphy, and Olympic Gold Medalists Rebecca Johnston and Brianne Jenner.\n\nThe building is a quonset shaped structure covered with multi-colored (orange, tan, black, and brown) brick wall cladding set in a common bond pattern. Projecting from the facade of the structure is a one story rectangular wing flanked on either side by two vertical appendages, which have multi-paned colored glass windows. The one story wing has a strip of casement windows. The stairway is situated on the west side of the building. A white concrete block structure with wall buttresses connects Lynah Rink to Bartels Hall. It was constructed for $500,000 with a donation from Walter S. Carpenter, Jr. whose gift came with the stipulation that he did not want his name on the building. The facility was designed by Van Storch, Evans, and Burkavage of Waverly, PA and constructed by Streeter Associates of Elmira, NY.\n\nThe rink opened on March 21, 1957 with a match between the New York Rangers (NHL) and the Rochester Americans (AHL) in front of 4200 spectators. It was subsequently dedicated on April 6, 1957 and named the James Lynah Skating Hall.\n\nIn March, 2006 Cornell University broke ground on a major renovation project designed to add to the rink. The additions and renovations included 464 new seats, upgraded locker rooms for both the men's and women's squads and their opponents, trainers' rooms, coaches' offices and a study area for players. A new scoreboard was added as well as preferred seating and a tunnel for the players.\n\nFans of Cornell's Hockey program, aptly named the \"Lynah Faithful,\" are among the loudest and most dedicated fans in the country, making Lynah Rink, many believe, one of college hockey's most hostile arenas. The raucous crowd support gives the Big Red one of the largest home ice advantages in college hockey, losing under 20% of their games on home ice since Lynah opened in 1957. The Lynah Faithful are cheered on by one cowbell, usually played by a zealous undergraduate, but only during the second and third periods (including overtime) at approximately mid-period. Many of the other regular chants of the Faithful are listed on a website, which serves as a useful primer in the history and traditions of Cornell Hockey when initiating new students into the Lynah Faithful. After the end of all games at Lynah, when the opposing team leaves the ice, the Cornell team gathers at center ice and raises their sticks to salute the faithful as they applaud the team. This is known as the Lynah salute.\nCornell's men's team has had great success at Lynah Rink, closing in on its 500th win on home ice. Its record at Lynah was 15-0-1 during the 2004–05 season, 15-0-0 during the 2002–03 season, and 14-1-1 during the 2001–02 season. Postseason success at Lynah has been equally impressive. Since Lynah Rink hosted its first postseason game in 1966, Cornell's men's team has a postseason record of 38-7-2 in games played there. During the same period they were 14-1 in single elimination games with the sole loss coming against Providence in 1978 and 12-3 in multi-game series.\n\nCornell has long been criticized for its policies regarding the distribution of season tickets to men's hockey home games. Students often wait in line for nights to get tickets; however, some believe that this is part of the experience of being among Lynah Faithful. It's common to see students wearing T-shirts proudly announcing, \"I did my time in the line.\" In 2005, despite efforts to improve the process over previous years, Cornell was criticized for creating chaos when the Athletic Department announced where students had to go for tickets. In 2006, this was alleviated when the ticket line was preselected at random. During the 2009–10 Hockey season, students did not have to wait in line for season passes given growing concerns over swine flu. Instead the tickets were distributed via a lottery. Beginning in the fall of 2010, Cornell Athletics began distributing tickets via online ticket sales, giving priority to students who had previously purchased season tickets.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1355135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1355135", "title": "Sanderstead", "text": "Sanderstead\n\nSanderstead is a village and medieval-founded church parish in the London Borough of Croydon. It takes in Purley Downs and the Sanderstead Plantation, a large wooded park that includes the animated second-highest point in London. The area sits above a dry valley at the edge of the built-up area of Greater London. Cementing its secular identity from the late 19th century until abolition in 1965 it had a civil parish council. The community had a smaller farming-centred economy until the mid 19th century. \n\nAll Saints' Church's construction began in about 1230 followed by great alterations and affixing of monuments including a poem attributed to John Dryden, the first Poet Laureate nationally; it is protected under UK law as Grade I listed. Sanderstead station is at the foot of the dry valley and has frequent, fast trains to East Croydon, connected to a range of London terminals and interchanges. Sanderstead is claimed to an origin of the English Sanders surname, noting at least four separate geographical clusters formed by the 19th century, two of which were by 1881 far more populous.\n\nSanderstead's Interwar growth coincided with electrification of the Southern Railway leaving largely a suburban community of households having at least one commuter to central London or Croydon.\n\nThere is evidence of prehistoric human activity in and around Sanderstead. In 1958–60 the Sanderstead Archaeological Group excavated in the vicinity of Sanderstead pond and revealed the presence of man as far back as the Mesolithic Period nearly 12,000 years ago, as well as pottery fragments dated between 100 AD and 1300 AD and a bronze belt from the end of the Saxon era. North of the village at Croham Hurst, upon a wooded hill, are circular barrows believed to be from a Bronze Age settlement. This is now part of a public open space and the site is marked by a brass monument. A Romano-British homestead (small farming settlement) was discovered during the construction of the Atwood School. During the 1980s, when the school was extended, further excavation revealed the remains of several round huts, hearths, a brooch, and pottery, some of which hailed from North Africa.\n\nAn Anglo-Saxon reference to Sanderstead can be found in the will, dated 871, of Alfred, an ealdorman. The village lay within the Anglo-Saxon administrative division of Wallington hundred. It later appears to have been given to St Peter's Abbey, Winchester (Hyde Abbey) by Æthelflæd, the wife of Edgar the Peaceful and mother of Edward the Martyr, where it remained after the Norman Conquest.\n\nSanderstead appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \"Sandestede\", and belonging to St Peter's Abbey, Winchester. It had a noted population (probably of just the adult males) of 26 including 21 villagers, 4 slaves and 1 cottager. Its Domesday assets were assessed as 5 hides, and 10 carucates of arable land. It had 9 ploughs and wood worth 30 hogs. Its Domesday entry records that in the time of Edward the Confessor it was valued at 100 shillings, and now 12 pounds; and yet it produces 15 pounds.\n\nThe village was granted to Sir John Gresham by Henry VIII following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. It was passed to his son Richard who subsequently sold it to John Ownsted, the transfer being ratified in 1591. Ownsted died without issue in 1600, and devised his estates to his two sisters and cousin Harman Atwood, with Atwood subsequently purchasing the shares of his joint legatees. The Atwood family had a long association with Sanderstead, with inscriptions at the local church indicating a presence in the village from the reign of Edward II.\n\nOn Monday, 6 September 1731, the nearby Sanderstead Common was the venue for an important cricket match between Surrey and Thomas Chambers' XI, Surrey winning the match by an unknown margin. On Monday, 26 June 1732, Surrey played London on the common. This match was drawn.\n\nThe manor house, known as Sanderstead Court, was substantially remodelled by Harman Atwood. This large country house was probably first constructed in the early sixteenth century. The Atwoods continued to occupy the house until 1778, when it was devised to Atwood Wigsell. It was turned into a hotel in 1928, and before the Second World War it was used by the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was very badly damaged by fire (not a bomb) in 1944 and was demolished in 1958. One very small part of the hotel building does however still stand. On the site now stands \"Sanderstead Court\", a three-storey block of flats.\n\nOne of the more curious aspects of Sanderstead is that it has no pub, unlike nearby Warlingham which has around six. \n\nOn the edge of the village lies the site of the Old Saw Mill now home to a number of private residences and the picturesque setting for Sanderstead Cricket Club. Cricket has been played here since 1883 and continues to the present day with four teams playing in the Surrey Championship and a number of other Colts and friendly teams.\n\nLocated between Limpsfield Road and Kingswood Lane is the large \"Kings Wood\".\nIt derives its name from a small wood to the north of Kings Wood Lodge. In 1823, Ordnance Survey Maps called the wood Sanderstead Wood, but this might be due to a mistake.\nIt covers some 147½ acres, criss-crossed by ancient rides and is on relatively flat ground. It was purchased in 1937 under the Green Belt Act by the local council and is now public open space. There is the site of a Romano-British settlement on the northern boundary, a small farmstead undisturbed for 2000 years.\n\nSanderstead has four schools, namely; Atwood Primary School, Gresham Primary School, Kingsdown Secondary School and Ridgeway Primary School. It is also conveniently placed for a number of others located within a couple of miles from the village including Croydon High School, Harris Academy Purley, Riddlesdown Collegiate, Royal Russell School, The Quest Academy, Thomas More Catholic School, Warlingham School, and Whitgift School.\n\nThe 2011 census showed that White British was the largest ethnic group in Sanderstead ward, forming 76% of the population.\n\nSanderstead has consistently returned Conservative Party MPs to the local seat of Croydon South and has also returned Conservative members to the local council. Since the north of Croydon tends to return Labour councillors, a near-identical split in representation follows. The current MP for Croydon South is Chris Philp.\n\nSanderstead is one of the twenty-four wards constituting Croydon London Borough Council. Three councillors are elected every four years to represent the ward on the Council. The current elected Councillors are:\n\nIn alphabetical order:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58995724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58995724", "title": "Scoring in Gaelic games", "text": "Scoring in Gaelic games\n\nThis page discusses scoring in the Gaelic games of hurling, Gaelic football, camogie, ladies' Gaelic football, international rules football and shinty-hurling. \n\nNote that although rounders and Gaelic handball are considered \"Gaelic games\", they are not listed under this page.\n\nIn hurling, Gaelic football, camogie, ladies' Gaelic football and shinty-hurling, the goalposts are placed apart and are at least tall, with a crossbar at a height of . Playing the ball (a sliotar or Gaelic football, depending on the game) between the posts and below the crossbar scores a goal (), while playing the ball between the posts and above the crossbar scores a point (\"cúilín\"). A goal is worth 3 points. The umpire signifies a goal by waving a green flag, and a point by waving a white flag. These flags have been used since the 1900s; one game in the United States in 1907 used a US flag to signify points, and an Irish flag (presumably the tricolour) for a goal.\n\nIn international rules football there are further posts either side of the goalposts. Playing the ball between the goalposts and these side posts scores a behind. Playing the ball between the centre posts and below the crossbar scores a goal, while playing the ball between the posts and above the crossbar scores an over. A goal is worth 6 points, an over 3, and a behind 1.\n\nThe Irish term for goal is \"cúl\", cognate with Latin \"cūlus\", \"rear.\" \"Point\" is \"cúilín\", a diminutive form.\n\nThe first Gaelic football and hurling rules were published by the fledgling Gaelic Athletic Association in 1885. These specified goalposts similar to soccer goals: for football wide and a crossbar high, while for hurling they were wide and a crossbar high. Goals were the only score possible; this led to a high number of drawn games.\n\nIn 1886 two poles were placed either side of the goals. A goal was scored when the ball was played into the goal; a point was scored when the ball was played above the crossbar, or wide of the goals between the two outer posts. When the ball was played wide of the outer posts, no score was recorded, unless it was played by a defernder, in which case a \"forfeit point\" was awarded.\n\nWhichever team scored most goals won the game; if teams were tied on goals, points were counted, and forfeit points were worth of a point. Forfeit points thus rarely made any difference, although one game in 1887 ended North Tipperary 0-0 (1), Holycross 0-0 (0).\n\nThe score was written in the format \"goals\"–\"points\" (\"forfeit points\"), e.g. Tipperary's score of 1-1 (1) in the 1887 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final\n\nIn 1888 the forfeit point was abolished, replaced by a puck in hurling and a kick in football. Hurling and Gaelic football goals were made the same size: by .\n\nIn 1892 the goal was changed to be worth five points. \n\nIn 1896 the goal was reduced to three points, and has held that value ever since.\n\nIn 1910 the side posts were removed, and the H-shaped goalposts introduced. Now, a point had to go over the crossbar.\n\nIn the 2005 National Hurling League two points were awarded for a point scored from a sideline cut in hurling, in recognition of the difficulty of this skill (typically only about one-fifth of such efforts are successful).\n\nThe idea of increasing the value of the goal to 4 points has come up repeatedly in recent years.\n\nAn oft-repeated aphorism, especially with regard to Gaelic football, is \"points win games\" or \"take your points and the goals will come.\" This has become especially true in recent decades: in the mid-1970s, games in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship averaged 3.5 goals, but in the 2000s this had fallen to 1 goal per game. Martin Breheny observed \"Improved fitness levels, more mobile defenders, and better defensive techniques have combined to seal off attackers' approach routes, making the goal an endangered species.\" Raising the value to 4 or even 5 points has been suggested.\n\nIn hurling, goals per game has decreased from a peak of 4.18 per game in 1983, in part because of a rule change that banned handpassed goals.\n\nA particular notation has been developed over the years by journalists and statisticians to record scoring in Gaelic games.\n\nA team's score is given in the form \"goals-points\", separated by either a hyphen ( - ) or en dash ( – ), for example \"Kerry 2-10 Cork 1-12\". The total points score may be given in brackets afterward for clarity: \"Kerry 2-10 (16) Cork 1-12 (15)\". Unlike other sports, where the home team's name is given before the away team, in Gaelic games the winning team's name is almost always given first.\n\nScores are spoken aloud thus:\n\nIn international rules football, the score is given in the format \"goals.overs.points (total)\", for example the 2014 International Rules Series ended Australia 0.17.5 (56), Ireland 2.9.7 (46).\n\nIn newspaper and other written accounts of games, the score of each individual player is given in abbreviated format. First the total is given, and then it is broken down by dead ball scores.\n\nSo if a report says \"James Kelly 2-5 (1-1f, 1-0pen, 0-2 '45')\", it means that he scored 2 goals and 5 points, of which a goal and a point were from frees, a goal from a penalty, two points from 45-metre kicks, and the other two points were from open play. If no goals are scored, the \"0-\" will be omitted, e.g. \"Michael O'Shea 0-9 (5f, 1 '65', 1 s/l)\". If all scores were of one type, the brackets may be omitted, reading: \"Síle Harrington 0-5f\" (indicating five points, all of which were frees) or \"J. J. Maguire 1-0pen\" (one goal, a penalty) or sometimes \"Sarah Moore 0-4(fs)\".\n"}
{"id": "443056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=443056", "title": "Skimboarding", "text": "Skimboarding\n\nSkimboarding (or skimming) is a boardsport in which a \"skimboard\" (much like a surfboard but smaller and without fins) is used to glide across the water's surface to meet an incoming breaking wave, and ride it back to shore. Wave-riding skimboarders perform a variety of surface and air maneuvers, at various stages of their ride, out to, and back with, the wave. Some of these are known as \"wraps,\" \"big spins,\" \"360 shove-its\" and \"180s.\" Unlike surfing, skimboarding begins on the beach by dropping the board onto the thin wash of previous waves. Skimboarders use their momentum to skim out to breaking waves, which they then catch back into shore in a manner similar to surfing. Another aspect of skimboarding is \"flatland,\" which involves performing tricks derived from skateboarding such as ollies and shove-its on the wash of waves without catching shore breaks. Skimboarding originated in Southern California when Laguna Beach lifeguards wanted to surf the local shore breaks that were too fast and shallow for surfboards. Skimboarding has developed since then to ride waves much like surfing, performing aerial maneuvers and pulling into the barrel of the wave. Professionals have even started getting towed by waverunners into much larger waves. Professional Skimboarder, Brad Domke, displayed the new technique in this video.\n\nRiders typically favor a board length which reaches about their mid-chest height when stood on end.\n\nThickness of the board depends somewhat on the materials used in construction, but typically ranges from 3/8 inch to 1 inch. The most common thicknesses are 5/8\" and 3/4\". A few high-flotation foam core boards and \"soft\" boards have been built with thicknesses in excess of 2 inches. A 5/8 board is capable of sharper turns while sacrificing a little speed. A 3/4 will be able to glide out farther, but turns slightly slower.\n\nMost skimboards will have some nose lift, or rocker. There are three types of rockers generally used for skimboards. There is a constant rocker, which means that the board has a constant curve from nose to tail. Constant rockers are known for better control on bigger waves and steeper slopes. Another type of rocker and the most commonly used is a hybrid rocker. This means that the board has a curve on the bottom through about 3/4 of the board's length, the rest (meaning the flat part) is usually the tail. This type of rocker is good for both speed and control on decent size waves; also the best type of board for flatland tricks. Last of all, a traditional rocker means that the board is almost completely flat except for the nose. A traditional rocker is typically used for east coast conditions where the waves are far out.\n\nThere are many types of dangers that skimboarders can face on a daily basis. It is not uncommon to see fractures or dislocations of the lower limbs, some requiring serious medical attention. Lacerations, twisted ankles and bruises are also common, due to impacts with the board itself, or rocks, logs and other obstacles present on beaches. Hamstring injury is also common due to the fast and extreme movement of a skimboarder's legs when they run toward the water and jump on the board. Drowning amongst skimboarders is not as likely as amongst surfers due to the shallow water in which skimboarding is usually practiced. Also, due to the shallow water, cervical fracture is a very dangerous possibility when riding big waves.\n\nA study was done in a British journal on the dangers of skimboarding, and it states, \"Over a 5 month period—May to September 2003, 10 patients were seen by the fracture team at the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust. Of the 10, eight were male, with an average age 18.7 (range 12–31). There was an equal incidence of left and right sided injuries. All the injuries were closed with no neurovascular symptoms or signs. Eight were to the lower limb, all of which were fractures of the distal tibia, ankle, and mid-foot. Six patients required hospital admission. . . [all of these injuries were from skimboarding]\"\n\nMany injuries that skimboarders suffer happen over a long period of time. Such injuries include: groin strain, fractures, leg pains, shin splints, etc. Some of these injuries can be prevented by stretching before and after a session.\n\nAnother foot injury that can occur is \"skimboard toe\". Much like \"turf toe,\" it develops from overuse and can eventually break bones in your foot.\n\nOther dangers to consider while skimboarding are riptides. They can be very strong in certain areas and bring a skimboarder out to sea very quickly. There have been a few incidences of skimboarders dying from drowning by being caught in a riptide. Many skimboarders recommend asking locals about tides and swells as well as checking tide charts if skimming in a new area. Doing so will also help avoid rocks that are hidden under waves, which are another potential cause of serious injury.\n\nMany consider the center of skimboarding to be located in Laguna Beach, California where skimboarding became popular in the late 1920s when lifeguards would skim across sand on pieces of wood. Every summer, Victoria Skimboards sponsors a contest called the VIC, which is held at Aliso Beach in Laguna; it is one of the biggest skimboarding competitions in the world. Other Laguna hot spots consist of Tenth street, West Street, Treasure Island, Thalia Street, and Crescent Bay. In Dewey Beach, Delaware, every year the World Amateur Championships of Skimboarding are held on New Orleans Street. The Florida Pro/Am is held every year in August, on Vilano Beach, Florida, which is known as the best East Coast skimboarding location. Big skimboarding waves are also found in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, people skim in many other locations throughout North America, Europe (the main locations being Portugal, France, Spain, United Kingdom & the Netherlands), Australia, Asia, and South America. Some people skim inland because of difficulty with shore access. Flatland skimboarding can be done nearly anywhere: lakes, rivers, creeks, ponds, golf courses, puddles, or even wet grass. In the United States, flatland skim scenes have developed primarily in states not bordering the ocean. Flatland has also developed in British Columbia, Ontario, and along The Great Lakes.\n\nAustralia (Melbourne and Parramatta), and Wellington, New Zealand also have dedicated flatland communities and riders. In Europe, the Flatland skim scene is growing fast, with the biggest group of skimboarders situated in Poland. Skimboarding is popular on many beaches where it is impossible to surf, for example, on Boa Viagem, Recife, Brazil, where surfing is banned due to the threat of shark attacks. Beaches that have streams or rivers flowing into the ocean can also make ideal downhill skimming areas.\n\nWave Riding Skimboards\n\nWave riding is the style most popular and best recognized in the sport of skimboarding. There are more athletes and competitions in wave riding than any other division of skimboarding. It is also the hardest and most technical. Today's wave riding boards are a product of years of trials and errors. There isn't much variation in shape because of this. There is a wide variety of beginner to very advanced, high performance boards in this category and it is important to choose the right one for your size, ability and style.\nWave riding skimboarders refer to their board as a \"skimboard.\" However to inland skimborders it is referred to as a \"foamie.\"\n\nThe majority of wave riding skimboard manufacturers use a closed cell foam, which is a high density foam material that resists water absorption and dings. A Fiber-reinforced polymer is commonly used to cover the foam forming a strong outer shell.\n\nFiberglass boards are great, compared to the wooden board. They are faster, lighter, and they have more control on the water. The fiberglass behaves across the sand and water better, which is important for doing tricks and moves with the skimboard when it hit the wave. Its outer shell is strong, but easy to dent with rocks, shells, like any other composite skimboard.\n\nCarbon fiber boards are lighter, stronger, and stiffer than the fiberglass skimboards and faster on the water and on the wet sand but they are one of the most expensive boards. These boards are more commonly used by professional riders that ride big waves.\n\nThere are four essential characteristics specific for riding a variety of waves. The board must be light enough to practically float (skim) on the water, but heavy enough that it will not fly away in the wind. It must be fast, as skimboarders need speed to get to the desired wave and not miss it completely. It must have adequate and appropriate rocker for your desired skimboarding location. It must be flexible according to personal preference based on riding style and ability.\n\nFlatland or Inland Skimboards\n\nInland boards are generally made of wood and are easy to find at a local surf or skate shop, depending on your location. Inland boards tend to be made of wood and have a hpl bottom and, therefore, are called \"woodies\" by wave-riding skimboarders. Wood core can boards are quite rugged. They are meant for grinding rails and doing tricks. They stand up well against rocks and shells, obstacles, and general wear, they are great for beginners because they are simple to make and low-price. They are also used by a lot of professional skimboarders and can learn how to do a lot more tricks such as a \"Bigger Spin\".\n\nThere are two basic sides of the spectrum for board types. The “Trick board,” a board where both sides are symmetrical and the shape is even throughout. This makes it ideal for spinning the board and completing tricks due to its symmetry. The “Cruiser board,” a board where the shape follows the same curves as a surfboard and is either slightly pointed or rounded at the top or tip and the back is slightly rounder. The backside of the board can also have a tail. These boards are typically called pintails.\n\nThe increasing international interest in skimboarding has resulted in the development of a competitive industry, catering for the ever-increasing demand for both quality and cheap skimboards. Each company has what they call team riders. Some famous riders are: Paulo Prietto, a professional skimboarder from California, and Brad Domke, a new rider from Florida which just beat the world record of the biggest wave ridden before, people who skimboard in competitions while representing their company sponsor to promote their boards. They usually have an amateur and professional team who are supplied by the manufacturer with skimboards at no or little cost. However, as a pro-rider the company usually pays for all traveling expenses for their riders on competition tours.\n\nSkimboarding contests are held to establish ranking amongst skimboarders and provide a way for companies to market products. In North America there are two centralized organizations that hold events: United Skim Tour and Skim USA. There are also a lot of minor competitions such as the Virgin River Classic held in St. George Utah. In recent years the United Skim Tour (UST) has focused solely on professional competition while Skim USA has gravitated towards amateur competition. Some events are both Skim USA and UST events, and all Skim USA competitions have a professional division.\n\nIn Europe, the European Skimboard League was created in 2009 to promote skimboarding across the world. Its creation has been seen as one of the finest moments in European skimboarding to date. The 2009 League was won by Emanuel (Mega) Embaixador and in 2010 Hugo Santos. The league consists of 4 stages mostly held in the summer months, although UK & Spanish events tend to happen just outside the holiday season. The stages are held in Portugal, France, The UK & Spain, each hosted at one of the best skimboarding locations found anywhere in the world. The UK event is held at Tolcarne Beach in Newquay, Cornwall. Newquay is a location famous for its surfing scene and Tolcarne Beach is known as the UK Wedge to many surfers, bodyboarders & skimboarders.\n\nThe DB Dash point Open is a flatland contest that takes place in Federal Way Washington, U.S.A at Dash Point State Park once a yearhttps://dbskimboards.com/articles/2016-db-pro-skimboard-contest. The Dash Point Pro/Am contest has been running for thirteen yearshttps://dbskimboards.com/articles/10th-annual-dash-point-proam. The first contest happened in 2003 and the latest in 2016 where Cody Maurer of Utah won first place in the Pro divisionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F8HcymKw3I. Maurer landed a flawless backside 270 big-spin to front board on a launch ramp to double flat bar set-up. This banger helped him win first place.\n\nIn the past The Victoria World Championships determined the World Champion of Professional Skimboarding. The United Skim Tour moved professional skimboarding to a points system in 2012. Most events consist of a set time and date, but, there has been a small movement to start holding waiting period competitions like the Florida Pro/Am held in Vilano Beach, Florida each year, also the DB Pro-AM at Dash Point State Park. The pros all look forward to the first official contest of the year, which until 2013 was held in Cabo San Lucas every spring, but is now held in Brazil. In 2013, Cabo San Lucas was moved to the second contest of the year. The Florida Pro/Am is a skimboarding tournament held each August, on Vilano Beach, Florida. It typically lasts three days, and is the final leg of The Florida Cross Over Tour which includes surfing, skateboarding and skimboarding. The Florida Pro/Am and The Florida Cross-Over Tour are both considered premier skimboarding events. Some well-known skimboarders are Austin Keen, who is the current 2013 UST World Champion, Bill Bryan, Brad Domke, Adrien Raza, Morgan Just, Grady Archbold, James Lovett, Sam Stinnett, Paulo Prietto, Brandon Sears, Brandon Rothe, Jackson Tenney, and Colton Wallace.\n\nThree leading companies are Exile Skimboards, Victoria Skimboards and Zap Skimboards. There are two types of contests; flatland and wave riding contests.\n\n\n"}

It serves primarily as a venue for football, being the home of AS Monaco and the Monaco national football team. From 1998 to 2012, the stadium hosted the annual UEFA Super Cup match.\n\nThe stadium is also used for the Herculis, a track and field meet of the IAAF Diamond League. From 2003 to 2005 it hosted the IAAF World Athletics Final, though certain events, such as the hammer, had to be held elsewhere, due to the stadium's relatively small capacity.\n\nThe original Stade Louis II was opened in 1939 as the home of AS Monaco. The new stadium was built in the early 1980s, close to the site of the old stadium on land reclaimed from the sea, opening fully in 1985. the capacity was about 18,500 all seated, about half of the population of Monaco (about 36,371), and more than any other stadium in the country. The vast majority of the stadium's facilities are located underground, with a large car park directly under the pitch (something that has caused some degree of criticism from managers of AS Monaco's opponents in the past over the state of the pitch).\n\nThe stadium is named after Louis II, Prince of Monaco, who was the Sovereign Prince of Monaco when the original stadium was built.\n\nOn 29 July 2008, Yelena Isinbayeva set the women's pole vault world record of 5.04 metres at the ground.\n\nOn 1 July 2011, The Eagles played at the ground at the wedding of Prince Albert II to Charlene Wittstock.\n\nOn 31 May 2004, an explosion, apparently deliberate, caused damage to the Stade Louis II and a neighbouring building, La Ruche, Fontvieille. No injuries were reported and responsibility for the attack remained unclear. The damage, while relatively extensive to portions of the fabric of the buildings, was verified as not having affected the buildings' respective structures. The Government of Monaco assumed responsibility for repairs to the damage caused by the explosion, without preempting the results of expert investigations, which continued. This explosion constituted a rare exception to the principality's long-established reputation for safety and absence of violence.\n\nThe Salle Gaston Médecin indoor arena is located under the stands of the football stadium. Salle Gaston Médecin is able to host basketball, volleyball, and handball games, as well as judo and fencing matches, and weightlifting and gymnastics competitions.\n\nStade Louis II, containing a large office complex, also houses the International University of Monaco (IUM), which specializes in business education.\n\n"}

Originally built for harness racing in 1826, the first auto race was run in 1903, making it the second oldest auto racing facility in United States history. The track and grandstands were torn down in 2016 by state government officials with the plan to modernize facilities. \n\nThe Syracuse Mile hosted harness racing from its opening until 2005. The Hambletonian Stakes were held from 1926 through 1929. In the early 1970s, a new 16,000-seat grandstand was built as part of an unsuccessful attempt to bring back the Hambletonian Stakes. \n\nIn 1900, a $10,000 bid was awarded to build a dirt track suitable for auto racing on the perimeter of the harness track. \nThe first auto race at the track was held in 1903, and won by Barney Oldfield in his \"Baby Bullet\". Oldfield averaged more than 60 mph in a lap around the mile. Syracuse was one of the several tracks one mile in length that made up the AAA national championship. From 1925 to 1971 the Fairgrounds Board contracted with former Indianapolis driver Ira Vail to promote auto racing. With Vail's promotion, drivers such as Mario Andretti, A.J. Foyt and Al Unser competed for wins during one of the Indianapolis 500's golden era's, putting the Syracuse Mile in the national spotlight. \n\nOn Labor Day 1949 the sportsman modified stock cars took to the track. The New York State Fair Championship then became a Labor Day a tradition that lasted until 2003. Floyd, New York driver Cliff Kotary reigned as State Fair Champion for six straight years (1960-1965). In 1955 the first of three races for what is now referred to as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series at the fairgrounds. Tim Flock, Buck Baker and Gwyn Staley were victorious in the three events held from 55-57. NASCAR's Convertible Stock Series also competed in 56 and 57. Curtis Turner and Possum Jones were victorious in those events. \n\nIn 1972, Glenn Donnelly began promoting races at the fairgrounds adding to the Labor Day event with races on the Fourth of July and Columbus Day weekend. The October race became Super DIRT Week, and continued at the Fairgrounds until 2015. Buzzie Reutimann beat NASCAR Hall of Famer Jerry Cook for the 1972 Championship. Brett Hearn of Kinnelon, New Jersey, became the all-time win leader at the \"Moody Mile,\" after claiming 6 Super Dirt Week main event victories and 6 \"358 Modified\" triumphs, the final coming in 2014.\n\nThe race track was nicknamed \"The Moody Mile\" after driver Wes Moody turned a 100-mile-per-hour lap in 1970. \n\nIn 2015, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a sweeping redesign of the fairgrounds that included taking out what was the 16,000-seat grandstand and mile-long dirt track. The last stock car race was held that year on Columbus day weekend.\n\n"}
