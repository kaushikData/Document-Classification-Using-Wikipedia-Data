{"id": "13095083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13095083", "title": "Birch Lane", "text": "Birch Lane\n\nBirch Lane was a rugby league ground in Bradford, England. It was the first long term home of Bradford Northern Rugby League Football Club, who played there for 26 years from 1908 to 1934 before moving to Odsal Stadium. For a short while it was also home to Bradford F.C. in their first incarnation as a football club. Birch Lane was described as \"notorious\" and a \"poverty-stricken place\" and was never popular either with Northern or Bradford F.C. for the short period they were there.\n\nThere is also a cricket ground at Birch Lane which adjoins the site of the rugby ground, home to Bowling Old Lane Cricket Club. This predates the rugby ground and continues in existence to this day.\n\nThe four acre field at Birch Lane which was to become the rugby and football ground was originally leased by the Bowling Old Lane Cricket Club. The plot, which adjoined the cricket ground, was taken on at the start of the 1886/87 season as a home for their counterpart rugby club.\n\nBradford F.C., the city's senior association football team at the time, spent a season at Birch Lane in 1898/99, when it was banished from its home at Park Avenue. At that time, the ground was generally referred to as Bowling Old Lane. The arrangement did not last. Birch Lane had poor transport connections and no shelter for supporters. Bradford played their last game at Birch Lane on 8 April 1899 when they beat Hunslet 2–1. In 1906, the Bowling Old Lane rugby club switched over to soccer.\n\nBradford Northern first approached the club to rent the ground shortly after their formation in 1907. However, the offer of £50 rent was refused at an AGM on 31 May of that year and the club based itself at Greenfield Athletic Ground instead. The following year, the Bowling Old Lane club relented and offered the field to Northern at a rent of £30. Despite having spent £302 on ground improvements at Greenfield, Northern accepted and approved the move at their AGM of June 1908.\n\nThat summer, an open stand of twelve terraces was built, with a press hut at its centre. Huddersfield were Northern's first visitors on 12 September 1908, when they won 14–11. In August 1913, the capacity of the ground was expanded by 2,000 by moving a boundary fence. Despite this, by 1921 Northern were already finding Birch Lane limiting and were looking for a new home.\n\nBirch Lane's biggest day was 16 February 1924 when 10,807 saw the first round Challenge Cup match with Dewsbury. The ground was unable to handle crowds of this size though and the wooden fencing around the pitch gave way. Later that year, a new embankment at the Cross Street end increased the capacity to 15,000, but Northern still chose to play major games at Valley Parade, home of Bradford City AFC. This included a match against the touring Australians.\n\nThe open stand was finally covered in January 1929, by which time Northern had agreed to move back to Greenfield, only for the move to fall through due to Northern's precarious finances. A move eventually came in June 1933, when Northern signed a lease with Bradford Council for the site that was to become Odsal Stadium, the biggest ground in England outside Wembley, still the club's home to this day. This move has been credited with keeping Bradford Northern in business. During their stay at the ground, Northern had only been kept going through 'mile of penny' schemes, bazaars and subscriptions. Birch Lane at that time, with \"its little stand, its surround of rusty galvanised iron pipe, its insecure unvertical posts and its similarity to a hen-run\" did little to enhance the club's status. Northern lost their last game at the ground 7–8 to St. Helens Recs on 7 April 1934, Tom Winnard scoring the last points at the ground. Bradford Northern Rugby League Football Club had played at Birch Lane for 26 years from 1908 to 1934.\n\nBirch Lane continued to be used for amateur rugby league for a number of years until eventually it was sold for development. Today, while the adjacent cricket ground remains, the former rugby ground is covered by housing and part of Ryan Street School. A stanchion from the stand could still be found in a neighbouring back garden as late as 1992.\n\nOther than Bradford Northern club games, Birch Lane also saw Bradford play host to international touring teams from Australia (sometimes playing as Australasia), New Zealand from 1921–1933.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6830211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6830211", "title": "Female athlete triad", "text": "Female athlete triad\n\nFemale athlete triad is a syndrome in which disordered eating (or \"low energy availability\"), amenorrhoea/\"oligomenorrhoea\", and \"decreased bone mineral density\" (osteoporosis and osteopenia) are present. Also known simply as the Triad, this condition is seen in females participating in sports that emphasize leanness or low body weight. The triad is a serious illness with lifelong health consequences and can potentially be fatal.\n\nThe female athlete triad is a syndrome of three interrelated conditions. Thus, if an athlete is suffering from one element of the Triad, it is likely that she is suffering from the other two components of the triad as well. With the increase in female participation in sports, much of it attributable to Title IX legislation in the United States, the incidence of a triad of disorders particular to women — the female athlete triad—has also increased. Due to this increasing prevalence, the female athlete triad and its relationship with athletics was identified in the 1980s as the symptoms, risk factors, causes and treatments were studied in depth and their relatedness evaluated. The condition is most common in cross country running, gymnastics, and figure skating. Many of those who suffer from the triad are involved in some sort of athletics, in order to promote weight loss and leanness. The competitive sports that promote this physical leanness may result in disordered eating, and be responsible for the origin of the Female Athlete Triad. For some women, not balancing the needs of their bodies and their sports can have major consequences. In addition, for some competitive female athletes, problems such as low self-esteem, a tendency toward perfectionism, and family stress place them at risk for disordered eating.\n\nClinical symptoms of the Triad may include disordered eating, fatigue, hair loss, cold hands and feet, dry skin, noticeable weight loss, increased healing time from injuries (e.g., lingering bruises), increased incidence of bone fracture and cessation of menses. Affected females may also struggle with low self-esteem and depression.\n\nUpon physical examination, a physician may also note the following symptoms: elevated carotene in the blood, anemia, orthostatic hypotension, electrolyte irregularities, hypoestrogenism, vaginal atrophy, and bradycardia.\n\nAn athlete may show signs of restrictive eating, but not meet the clinical criteria for an eating disorder. She may also display subtle menstrual disturbances, such as a change in menstrual cycle length, anovulation, or luteal phase defects, but not yet have developed complete amenorrhea. Likewise, an athlete's bone density may decrease, but may not yet have dropped below her age-matched normal range. These signs can be considered \"occult,\" as no one symptom may be severe enough to seek medical attention, leaving the Triad to go unnoticed or untreated.\n\nEnergy availability is defined as energy intake minus energy expended. Energy is taken in through food consumption. Our bodies expend energy through normal functioning as well as through exercise. In the case of female athlete triad, low energy availability may be due to eating disorders, but not necessarily so. Athletes may experience low energy availability by exercising more without a concomitant change in eating habits, or they may increase their energy expenditure while also eating less. Disordered eating is defined among this situation due to the low caloric intake or low energy availability.\n\nWhile most athletes do not meet the clinical criteria to be diagnosed with an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, many will exhibit disordered eating habits such as fasting, as well as avoiding certain types of food the athlete thinks are \"bad\" (such as foods containing fat). More severe examples of disordered eating habits may include binge-eating; purging; and the use of diet-pills, laxatives, diuretics, and enemas.\n\nBy restricting their diet, the athlete may worsen their problem of low energy availability. Having low dietary energy from excessive exercise and/or dietary restrictions leaves too little energy for the body to carry out normal functions such as maintaining a regular menstrual cycle or healthy bone density.\n\nAmenorrhea, defined as the cessation of a woman’s menstrual cycle for more than three months, is the second disorder in the Triad. Weight fluctuations from dietary restrictions and/or excessive exercise affect the hypothalamus’s output of gonadotropic hormones. Gonadotropic hormones “stimulate growth of the gonads and the secretion of sex hormones.” (e.g. gonadotropin-releasing hormone, lutenizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone.) These gonadotropic hormones play a role in stimulating estrogen release from the ovaries. Without estrogen release, the menstrual cycle is disrupted. Exercising intensely and not eating enough calories can lead to decreases in estrogen, the hormone that helps to regulate the menstrual cycle. As a result, periods may become irregular or stop altogether.\n\nThere are two types of amenorrhea. A woman who has been having her period and then stops menstruating for ninety days or more is said to have secondary amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea is characterized by delayed menarche (the onset of menses during puberty). Delayed menarche may be associated with delay of the development of secondary sexual characteristics.\n\nOsteoporosis is defined by the National Institutes of Health as ‘‘a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture.’’ Low estrogen levels and poor nutrition, especially low calcium intake, can lead to osteoporosis, the third aspect of the triad. This condition can ruin a female athlete's career because it may lead to stress fractures and other injuries.\n\nPatients with female athlete triad get osteoporosis due to hypoestrogenemia, or low estrogen levels. With estrogen deficiency, the osteoclasts live longer and are therefore able to resorb more bone. In response to the increased bone resorption, there is increased bone formation and a high-turnover state develops which leads to bone loss and perforation of the trabecular plates. As osteoclasts break down bone, patients see a loss of bone mineral density. Low bone mineral density renders bones more brittle and hence susceptible to fracture. Because athletes are active and their bones must endure mechanical stress, the likelihood of experiencing bone fracture is particularly high.\n\nAdditionally, because those suffering with female athlete triad are also restricting their diet, they may also not be consuming sufficient amounts vitamins and minerals which contribute to bone density; not getting enough calcium or vitamin D further exacerbates the problem of weak bones.\n\nBone mass is now thought to peak between the ages of 18-25. Thus, behaviors which result in low bone density in youth could be detrimental to an athlete’s bone health throughout her lifetime.\n\nIn addition, ovulation is the primary way that females create the hormone progesterone. When an ovum is released from the ovary, the structure that remains develops into the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum emits the hormone progesterone during the 10-16 days of the luteal phase. Without experiencing regular, ovulatory menstrual cycles, the female is not secreting the hormone progesterone during the luteal phase of her cycle. Progesterone directly stimulates osteoblasts to make new bone. Therefore if the woman is not ovulating, she is not creating progesterone, and misses out on this opportunity to stimulate new bone growth. \n\nGymnastics, figure skating, ballet, diving, swimming, and long distance running are examples of sports which emphasize low body weight. The Triad is seen more often in aesthetic sports such as these versus ball game sports. Women taking part in these sports may be at an increased risk for developing female athlete triad.\n\nAthletes at greatest risk for low energy availability are those who restrict dietary energy intake, who exercise for prolonged periods, who are vegetarian, and who limit the types of food they will eat. Many factors appear to contribute to disordered eating behaviors and clinical eating disorders. Dieting is a common entry point and interest has focused on the contribution of environmental and social factors, psychological predisposition, low self-esteem, family dysfunction, abuse, biological factors, and genetics. Additional factors for athletes include early start of sport-specific training and dieting, injury, and a sudden increase in training volume. Surveys show more negative eating attitude scores in athletic disciplines favoring leanness. Disordered eating behaviors are risk factors for eating disorders.\n\nThe underlying cause of the female athlete triad is an imbalance between energy taken into the body (through nutrition) and energy used by the body (through exercise). The treatment includes correcting this imbalance by either increasing calories in a diet or by decreasing calories burned by exercise for 12 months or longer. Persons with female athlete triad should get treatment from a multi-disciplinary team that includes a physician, dietitian, and mental health counselor, and seek support from family, friends, and their coach.\n\nBecause a symptom of the female athlete triad is menstrual dysfunction, some physicians may recommend oral contraceptives because those pills will regulate the menstrual cycle. However, the underlying cause of the menstrual disorder is an energy imbalance, and using pills to regulate the menstrual cycle without changes in diet and behavior is likely to mask the food deficiency and delay appropriate treatment. A woman taking contraceptives to treat menstrual dysfunction without correcting this energy imbalance will continue to lose bone density.\n\nContinued participation in training and competition depends on the physical and mental health of the athlete. Athletes who weigh less than 80 percent of their ideal body weight may not be able to safely participate.\n\nPersons with female athlete triad are often asked by health care providers to reduce the amount of time they spend exercising by 10-12 percent.\n\nLow energy availability with or without eating disorders, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, and osteoporosis, alone or in combination, pose significant health risks to physically active girls and women. Prevention, recognition, and treatment of these clinical conditions should be a priority of those who work with female athletes to ensure that they maximize the benefits of regular exercise.\n\nPatients are recommended to work with a dietician who can monitor their nutritional status and help the patient work towards a healthy goal weight. Patients should also meet with a psychiatrist or psychologist to address the psychological aspects of the triad. Therefore, it is important that trainers and coaches are made aware of the athlete’s condition and be part of her recovery.\n\nPatients are also sometimes treated pharmacologically. To both induce menses and improve bone density, doctors may prescribe cyclic estrogen or progesterone as is used to treat post-menopausal women. Patients may also be put on oral contraceptives to stimulate regular periods. In addition to hormone therapy, nutrition supplements may be recommended. Doctors may prescribe calcium supplements. Vitamin D supplements may be also used because this vitamin aids in calcium absorption. Bisphosphonates and calcitonin, used to treat adults with osteoporosis, may be prescribed, although their effectiveness in adolescents has not yet been established. Finally, if indicated by a psychiatric examination, the affected athlete may be prescribed anti-depressants and in some cases benzodiazepines to help in alleviating severe distress at mealtimes.\n\nSustained low energy availability, with or without disordered eating, can impair health. Psychological problems associated with eating disorders include low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety disorders. Medical complications involve the cardiovascular, endocrine, reproductive, skeletal, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. The prognosis for anorexia nervosa is grave with a six-fold increase in standard mortality rates compared to the general population. In one study, 5.4% of athletes with eating disorders reported suicide attempts. Although 83% of anorexia nervosa patients partially recover, the rate of sustained recovery of weight, menstrual function and eating behavior is only 33%.\n\nAmenorrheic women can be infertile, due to the absence of ovarian follicular development, ovulation, and luteal function. Consequences of hypoestrogenism seen in amenorrheic athletes include impaired endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation, which reduces the perfusion of working muscle, impaired skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and vaginal dryness.\n\nDue to low bone mineral density that declines as the number of missed menstrual cycles accumulates, and the loss of BMD may not be fully reversible. Stress fractures occur more commonly in physically active women with menstrual irregularities and/or low BMD with a relative risk for stress fracture two to four times greater in amenorrheic than eumenorrheic athletes. Fractures also occur in the setting of nutritional deficits and low BMD.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the AAFP contend that exercise is important and should be promoted in girls for health and enjoyment, however pediatricians should be wary of health problems that may occur in female athlete. The health related issues concerning this topic are grave and can lead to numerous health issues as previously demonstrated. The treatment plan will depend on the severity of the disorder, however some form of treatment has been shown as helpful to produce successful progress towards a better health condition. Clearly, many health problems arise due to disordered eating.\n\nCoaches are discouraged from active participation in the treatment of eating disorders. In addition to conflicts of interest, coaches may be perceived to pressure athletes and potentially perpetuate components of the Female Athlete Triad. For example, in maintaining a place on the team or continued scholarship support, a female athlete may feel compelled to overtrain or restrict eating.\n\n\n"}

It is bordered on the south by Eberswalder Straße, on the north by the Max Schmeling Halle, on the west by Mauerpark, where part of the Berlin Wall once stood. The complex includes a football and athletics stadium as well as several smaller sports fields. The stadium is the second largest in the city after Berlin's Olympiastadion with approximately 20,000 seats, of which 15,000 covered, and has temporarily been used by various Berlin football sides. Following its 2014 advance to the Regionalliga Nordost, Berliner FC Dynamo is now the main user of the stadium, together with Berlin Adler.\n\nFriedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was the venue for the 2018 World Para Athletics European Championships.\n\nSince 1825, the area was used as the drill grounds of the Guard Regiment of the Prussian army. Some housing was constructed on the site late in the 19th century, but this was a short-lived use and the area soon became an open space used for sports. Between 1892 and 1904, the site served as the ground of Hertha BSC. The city of Berlin purchased the land in 1912 and developed it for sports use in 1913.\n\nAfter World War II and the division of the capital city, the area was part of what became East Berlin, in the Soviet zone of occupation. A football and athletics stadium, with a capacity of 30,000 spectators, was built on the site in 1951, for use during the World Youth Festival that year. Known initially as Berliner Sportpark, East German municipal officials renamed the facility the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark the following year, to honour the centenary of the birth of the man known in Germany as the father of gymnastics. The stadium was refurbished in 1988 and its capacity reduced to the present-day number.\n\nFrom 1963 to 1989, the facility hosted the Olympic Day of Athletics competition, modeled on a similar event staged each year in West Berlin. The meet saw the setting of several world records, including Uwe Hohn's record javelin throw of 104.80 meters on 20 July 1984 – the first time a throw of over 100 meters was made.\nEast German first division club Berliner FC Dynamo played its DDR-Oberliga home fixtures here. The wine-reds celebrated nine of its ten consecutive championships (1979 through 1988) in the stadium, except for the 1986/87 season when the stadium was under reconstruction. In the 1970s and 1980 BFC hosted teams such as Red Star, Aston Villa, Hamburger SV, AS Roma, Werder Bremen and Girondins Bordeaux for its European Cup matches in the stadium.\n\nThe national side played ten international matches at the stadium between 1951 and 1990, including its 13 March 1974 contest versus Belgium, which ended with a 5–2 victory in front of a record 30,000 spectators.\n\nThe stadium was used by the Berlin Thunder of the NFL Europe during 1999-2002. The amateur side of Hertha BSC (Hertha BSC II) also use the facility, when they expect an unusually large crowd or where there are security concerns related to a match. The final of the Berlin Cup is also held here each season.\n\nIn 2006 Hertha BSC played its UEFA Intertoto Cup semi-final match against FK Moscow (0–0) here, as well as its UEFA Cup qualification home contest against Georgian club FC Ameri Tbilisi (1–0). In 2016 Hertha played their Europa League qualification match against Brondby at the stadium and won 1-0, however Hertha lost the corresponding fixture away from home 3-1 and were knocked out of the competition.\n\nThe facility also serves as a concert venue and has welcomed performers such as Michael Jackson during his Dangerous World Tour on 4 September 1992, which was watched by 35.000 people.\n\nIn May 2001 stadium hosted the 2001 Speedway Grand Prix of Germany, first GP event at temporary track. The Grand Prix was won by Pole Tomasz Gollob, top German rider, Robert Barth, finished 14th.\n\nIn Juli 2014 it was announced that the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was chosen as the venue for the 2015 UEFA Women's Champions League Final. The final was held on 14 May 2015.\n\nThe stadium is also regularly used for American football and serves as the home venue for the Berlin Adler. It is also the annual venue of the German Bowl since 2012 and was the site of the 2014 Eurobowl final, where the Berlin Adler defeated the New Yorker Lions 20-17.\n\nThe stadium is considered to be in a state of decay, satisfying neither current needs nor future plans. In order to host the 2015 UEFA Women's Champions League final, the stadium was temporary renovated at an estimated cost of €1.5 million - €2 million. This temporary renovation included new paintwork, refurbished player and visitor facilities, a new fire alarm system and a new lawn. That was however only the beginning, as the entire area is planned for a future complete redevelopment.\n\nThe area is highly popular and the needs for sporting facilities in Berlin are many. Even when the stadium is empty, the area around is crowded. The neighboring Mauerpark is popular among the citizens of Berlin. Its flea market attracts more than 40,000 visitors each Sunday. The population pressure of Prenzlauer Berg is also high, with Pankow having the highest birth rate in Berlin. In preparation for the plans, more than 40 users of sport facilities in Berlin have been interviewed.\n\nBeing the second largest stadium in the city, in terms of seating capacity, and with the Olympic Stadium often considered too large, the stadium also plays a crucial role for the possibility of arranging major sports events in Berlin. A redeveloped stadium would fit in Germany's bid for hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics or 2028 Summer Olympics. If Berlin is awarded the 2024 Summer Olympics, the stadium is planned to be the center of the Paralympics.\n\nAccording to a preliminary draft concept, the redeveloped Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is to be an inclusion sports facility, which goes beyond simple accessibility. The plan includes new office spaces for associations and clubs in the grandstand of the stadium and in new buildings, and possibly a new sports hall for clubs and schools with two or three pitches, one or two artificial turf fields, additional tennis, beach volleyball and beach football fields. Further plans includes a day care center and a car park that could possibly also serve the popular Max-Schmeling-Halle.\n\nIn January 2015, it was reported that the entire cost for the redevelopment of the whole area was estimated at up to €150 million. The redeveloped stadium will have a capacity of 20,000 spectators and offer future second division fit. The stadium will have soil heating, completely new seats, fully covered stands and become barrier-free. The distinctive floodlights will be preserved.\n\nIn February 2015 it was reported by the Berliner Zeitung that the Senate of Berlin wants to rebuild the stadium, and that the reconstruction could begin at earliest in 2018 and be completed by 2023. In February 2017, German media reported that the senate is planning to invest €170 million in the redevelopment of the area, including €85 million for a new stadium, and that the current stadium will be demolished by 2020. \n\nThe stadium is located in Berlin, in the locality of Prenzlauer Berg, which forms the southern part of the borough of Pankow. The stadium can be reached via the U-Bahn line U2, station Eberswalder Straße, and via the tramway lines M1, M10 and 12.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "981626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=981626", "title": "Hypermodernism (chess)", "text": "Hypermodernism (chess)\n\nHypermodernism is a school of chess that emerged after World War I. It featured challenges to the chess ideas of central European masters, including Wilhelm Steinitz's approach to the centre and the rules established by Siegbert Tarrasch. \n\nThe Hypermoderns demonstrated their new ideas with games and victories. Aron Nimzowitsch showed that games could be won through indirect control of the center, breaking with Tarrasch's view that the center must be occupied by pawns. Nimzowitsch advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns, thus inviting the opponent to occupy the center with pawns, which can then become targets of attack. This was part of the hypermodern framework, which Nimzowitsch encapsulated in his seminal book \"My System\", which greatly influenced many chess players. It introduced and formalized concepts of the pawn chain, overprotection, undermining, prophylaxis, restraint, rook on the seventh rank, knight outposts, the dynamics of the isolated queen's pawn, and other areas of chess.\n\nAlthough none of the primary exponents of the Hypermodern school ever achieved the title of World Chess Champion, they were among the world's strongest players. World Champion Alexander Alekhine was associated with hypermodernism, but his style was more of a blend with the Classical school.\n\nIn practice, hypermodernism has not replaced the classical theory of Steinitz and Tarrasch. Instead, modern chess textbooks describe hypermodernism as an addition, or extension, to classical theory.\n\nHypermodern openings include the Réti Opening, King's Indian Defence, Queen's Indian Defence, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Nimzowitsch Defense, Grünfeld Defence, Bogo-Indian Defence, Old Indian Defence, Catalan Opening, King's Indian Attack, Alekhine's Defence, Modern Defence, Pirc Defence, Larsen's opening, Sokolsky Opening, and to a lesser degree the English Opening. Openings such as 1.a3 do not constitute hypermodern openings since, although they delay the occupation of the centre with pawns, they also delay piece development.\n\nHoward Staunton and many of his contemporaries understood various ideas associated with hypermodernism . The Hypermodern school of chess theory came to prominence in the 1920s. Leading members were Aron Nimzowitsch, Richard Réti, Savielly Tartakower, Gyula Breyer, and Ernst Grünfeld, who all came from Central Europe . They felt that chess was becoming boring, slow and not worthwhile. They also believed that chess could not be defined by a simple set of laws or principles, such as those laid out by the German Siegbert Tarrasch.\n\nTheir ideas were thus a challenge to the existing orthodoxy popularised by Tarrasch in the 1890s. This orthodoxy was a rather dogmatic distillation of the ideas worked out by chess pioneer Wilhelm Steinitz. Steinitz was the first player who in his play demonstrated a mastery of positional chess, and the ideas he developed came to be known as the \"Classical\" or \"Modern\" school of thought. This school of thought emphasized the importance of \"static\" advantages such as avoidance of pawn weaknesses, strong outposts for knights, and striving for \"good\" rather than \"bad\" bishops in positions with locked pawn structures. This school of thought was in turn a reaction to the earlier swashbuckling style of Adolf Anderssen, Henry Blackburne and others who represented the Romantic school.\n\nIn 1922, Richard Réti published \"Die neuen Ideen im Schachspiel\" (English: \"The New Ideas in Chess\"), an examination of the evolution of chess thinking from the time of Paul Morphy through the beginning of the Hypermodern school. Tartakower's book \"Die hypermoderne Schachpartie\" (English: \"The Hypermodern Chess Game\") was published in 1924. Nimzowitsch's book \"Mein System\" (English: \"My System\") was published in 1925 through to 1927 in five installments. It discusses elements of hypermodernism, but focuses mainly on positional chess.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18933209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18933209", "title": "Olympic medal table", "text": "Olympic medal table\n\nThe Olympic medal table is a method of sorting the medal placements of countries in the modern-day Olympics and Paralympics. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not officially recognize a ranking of participating countries at the Olympic Games. Nevertheless, the IOC does publish medal tallies for information purposes, showing the total number of Olympic medals earned by athletes representing each country's respective National Olympic Committee. The convention used by the IOC is to sort by the number of gold medals the athletes from a country have earned. In the event of a tie in the number of gold medals, the number of silver medals is taken into consideration, and then the number of bronze medals. If two countries have an equal number of gold, silver, and bronze medals, they are ordered in the table alphabetically by their IOC country code.\n\nThe Olympic Charter, Chapter 1, section 6 states that:\n\nThe Charter goes even further in Chapter 5, section 57, expressly prohibiting the IOC from producing an official ranking:\nAccording to Australian IOC member Kevan Gosper, the IOC began to accommodate medals tables in 1992, releasing 'information' based on the 'gold first' standard. The medal tables provided on its website carry this disclaimer:\nEach Olympic Games organising committee (except in 1904) has published an official report after the conclusion of the Games, which among other things list the results of each event. Some early reports included an overall national ranking, including those of 1908, 1912, 1924 (Summer and Winter) and 1928 (Winter). The 1912 and 1924 tables are described as \"official\" while that of 1928 is \"unofficial\".\n\nThe 1932 Winter Games report states, \"There is no official point score in the Olympic Games\" and quotes General Rule 19 of the 1930 Olympic Charter, \"In the Olympic Games there is no classification according to points\". It states that the country-based organisation of teams is \"chiefly for practical convenience\" and that country rankings are \"a grave injustice on the smaller countries\". It continues that \"it has been the experience of all previous Olympic Games that the press of the world insist on exploiting the aspect of national rivalry by creating and publishing a wholly unofficial point score of their own devising, most often on the basis of 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 points for the six places recognized on the table of honor\". The report itself provides such a table \"for ready reference\".\n\nThe sports funding agencies of some nations have set targets of reaching a certain rank in the medals table, usually based on gold medals; examples are Australia, Japan, France, and Germany. Funding is reduced for sports with low prospects of medals.\n\nAfter London's successful bid to host the 2012 Olympics, UK Sport submitted a funding request to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport setting an \"aspirational goal\" of fourth place in the 2012 medals table, to be reviewed after the 2008 Olympics, for which a target of eighth place was set. The British Olympic Association dissociated itself from setting targets. When Britain finished fourth in 2008, the 2012 target was settled at fourth, with the team ultimately finishing third.\n\nAustralia's disappointing 10th-place in the 2012 medals table prompted the Australian Sports Commission to draw up a ten-year plan which included a \"medium-term\" goal of a top-five place in the Summer Olympics and Paralympics and a top-15 place in the winter games.\n\nWhen Tokyo bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the Japanese Olympic Committee set a 2016 target of third place in gold medals, which it retained even after the games were awarded in 2009 to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAs the IOC does not consider its sorting of nations to be an official ranking system, various methods of ranking nations are used. Some sort rankings decided by the total number of medals the country has but most list by the gold medals counted. However, if two or more teams have the same number of gold medals, the silver medals are then judged from the most to the least and then the bronze medals.\n\nThe gold first ranking system described above is used by most of the world media, as well as the IOC. While the gold first ranking system has been used occasionally by some American media outlets, newspapers in the United States primarily publish medal tables ordered by the total number of medals won.\n\nThis difference in rankings has its origins in the early days of the Olympics, when the IOC did not publish or recognise medal tables. Before the 2002 Winter Olympics the difference in ranking system received scant notice, since in recent Olympic history the country that led in total medals also led in the gold count. However, during the 2002 Winter Olympics Germany won the highest number of medals (36), but earned one gold medal fewer than Norway - the latter winning 13. A similar situation occurred at the 2008 Summer Olympics, with China and U.S. topping the gold and total medal tallies respectively, and then again at the 2010 Winter Olympics when Canada and the U.S. finished 1st and 3rd respectively in the \"gold first\" ranking and 3rd and 1st respectively in terms of total medals won. \nOther exceptions are the 1896, 1912, and 1964 Summer Olympics when the United States finished first in gold medal count, but second in the overall medal count.\nIn an August 24, 2008 news conference, IOC President Jacques Rogge confirmed that the IOC does not have a view on any particular ranking system.\n\nSporting success predictions and ratings can be univariate, i.e. based on one independent variable, such as a country's population size and the number of medals is divided by the population of the country, or multivariate, where resources-per-person in the form of GDP per capita and other variables are included. \n\nResources per person in the form of GDP per capita has been included in an article by \"The Guardian\" published during the 2012 Summer Olympics and again by Google's News Lab for the Rio 2016 games. Already in 2002, the research done by Meghan Busse of Northwestern University suggested that both a large population and high per capita GDP are needed to generate high medal totals, and predictive models have been built trying to predict success with multivariate analysis, taking also past results and host-nation advantage into account.\n\nSystematic rankings based upon a weighted point system with the most points awarded to a gold medal have also been devised. Those used in the official reports were:\nThe 1908 and 1924 systems share the points for tied placings: for example, in a two-way tie for second, each gets half the sum of the points for second and third place.\n\nIn 2004, a 3:2:1 system was used by the Australian Geography Teachers Association. This weighting values a gold medal as much weight as a silver and a bronze medal combined. In response to the 2008 controversy over medal rank, Jeff Z. Klein in a \"New York Times\" blog post proposed a 4:2:1 system as a compromise between the total-medals and golds-first methods. These systems have been popular in certain places at certain times, but none of them have been adopted on a large scale.\n\n"}

US$20 million).\n\nAsked by the Turkish Ice Skating Federation, the Metropoiitan Municipality of Istanbul planned to build an ice rink in 1989. The district municipality of Fatih allocated the current site for the building of the venue. However, the government was reluctant to provide the funds required. The planning and the works proceeded only slow since the project proved to be difficult due to lack of technical know-how about the construction of an ice rink.\nShortly before the completion of the construction, a major earthquake in 1999 devastated parts of Istanbul. Due to an expertise, the building was declared unsafe. The structure was then demolished, and the project was abandoned.\n\nYears after, the project to build an ice rink resumed with pressure from the ice skating community and financial support from the government. In 2007, the construction of a new ice skating venue began at the same site in Silivrikapı that was finally completed in September 2009. Shortly after its opening, the venue hosted International Skating Union's Junior Grand Prix of Figure Skating event.\n\nSilivrikapı Ice Skating Hall hosts ice hockey clubs of Istanbul, which carried out their trainings in the past at the Galleria Ice Rink, a small size ice rink in a shopping mall not far from the Silivrikapı Arena.\n\n\n\n"}
