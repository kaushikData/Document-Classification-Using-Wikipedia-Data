Between 1885 and 1902 it developed into a series of sporting books which aimed to cover comprehensively all major sports and pastimes. The books were published in London by Longmans, Green & Co. and in Boston by Little, Brown & Co.\n\nThe series was dedicated to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, \"one of the best and keenest sportsmen of our time\".\n\nThe founder of the Library, the Duke of Beaufort, acted as its overseeing editor, assisted by Alfred E. T. Watson, and chose authors who were authorities in their fields. Explaining his purpose, the Duke said: \n\nThe \"Badminton Library\" was originally published in twenty-eight volumes between 1885 and 1896. To these was later added \"Rowing & Punting\" (1898), superseding \"Boating\" (1888). New volumes for \"Athletics\" (1898) and \"Football\" (1899) supplemented the original \"Athletics and Football\" (1887). In 1902, the final entirely new volume, \"Motors and Motor-Driving\", covered a new sport, and lastly there was a new edition of \"Cricket\" in 1920.\n\nOn the combining of athletics and football in a single volume, Mike Huggins says in \"The Victorians and Sport\" (2004) that it suggests \"...that football's leading place was not yet assured amongst the more literate reading public.\"\n\nThe original volume on \"Cricket\" (1888) has sixteen chapters on topics such as 'Batting', 'Bowling', 'Fielding', and 'Umpires'. It defines the Marylebone Cricket Club as \"The Parliament of Cricket\" and describes the sport as \"Our National Game\". Allan Gibson Steel wrote the chapter on bowling.\n\n\"Cycling\" (1887), by Viscount Bury, notes that riding the tricycle and bicycle, whether by women or by men, \"is by far the most recent of all sports in the Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes. There is none which has developed more rapidly in the last few years.\" It considers that \"England may be looked upon as the Home of Cycling\" and quotes Thomas Huxley's words to the Royal Society: \"Since the time of Achilles, no improvement had added anything to the speed or strength attainable by the unassisted powers of man\", commenting that a bicyclist had recently raced 146 miles in only ten hours.\n\n\"Skating\" (1892) deals first with 'Origins and Development', 'Figure skating', and 'Recreation and Racing', noting that Holland was \"the Skater's Paradise\" and giving a list of racing records since the 1820s, then continues with chapters on Curling, Tobogganing, Ice-Sailing and Bandy.\nLaura and Guy Waterman's \"Yankee Rock & Ice\" (2002) calls the Badminton Library \"a quaint turn-of-the-century British series\", while a review of the publication \"Collectors Guide to the Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes\" says of the books: \n\nA useful series for purposes of comparison is the slightly later \"American Sportsman's Library\".\n\nThe \"Badminton Library\" was published in three different formats:\n\n\nThe name 'Badminton Library' was derived from that of Duke of Beaufort's principal country house, Badminton in Gloucestershire. There is no volume in the series on the sport of Badminton, named after the same house.\n\n\nJ. K. Stanford's fictional game shot George Hysteron-Proteron was said to have been educated at Eton, the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and the \"Badminton Library\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "200151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=200151", "title": "Jenga", "text": "Jenga\n\nJenga is a game of physical skill created by Leslie Scott, and currently marketed by Hasbro. Players take turns removing one block at a time from a tower constructed of 54 blocks. Each block removed is then placed on top of the tower, creating a progressively taller and more unstable structure.\n\nThe name \"jenga\" is derived from \"kujenga\", a Swahili word which means \"to build\".\n\nJenga is played with 54 wooden blocks. Each block is three times longer than its width, and one fifth as thick as its length . Blocks have small, random variations from these dimensions so as to create imperfections in the stacking process and provide additional challenge to the game. To set up the game, the included loading tray is used to stack the initial tower which has eighteen levels of three blocks placed adjacent to one another along their long side and at right angles to the previous level (so, for example, if the blocks in the first level lie lengthwise north-south, the second-level blocks will lie east-west). \n\nOnce the tower is built, the person who built the tower gets the first move. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any level (except the one below the incomplete top level) of the tower, and placing it on the topmost level to complete it. Only one hand should be used at a time when taking blocks from the tower. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place must be returned to its original location before removing another block. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower or after ten seconds, whichever occurs first.\n\nThe game ends when the tower falls, or if any piece falls from the tower other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The winner is the last person to successfully remove and place a block.\n\nJenga was created by Leslie Scott, the co-founder of Oxford Games Ltd, based on a game that evolved within her family in the early 1970s using children's wooden building blocks the family purchased from a sawmill in Takoradi, Ghana. A British national, Scott was born in Tanganyika, where she was raised speaking English and Swahili, before moving to live in Ghana, West Africa. Scott launched the game she named and trademarked as \"Jenga\" at the London Toy Fair in January 1983 and sold it through her own company, Leslie Scott Associates. The blocks of the first sets of Jenga were manufactured for Scott by the Camphill Village Trust in Botton, Yorkshire. The V&A Museum of Childhood has exhibited one of the original sets of Jenga since 1982.\n\nIn 1984, Robert Grebler, an entrepreneur from California who was the brother of a close friend of Scott, contacted her and expressed interest in importing and distributing Jenga in Canada. In April 1985, Grebler acquired from Scott the exclusive rights to Jenga for the United States and Canada, and then in October of that year, Scott assigned the worldwide rights in Jenga to Grebler, which he in turn assigned to Pokonobe Associates. Convinced of Jenga's potential, Grebler had invited two cousins to form Pokonobe Associates with him in 1985 to increase distribution of Jenga. Pokonobe then licensed Irwin Toy to sell Jenga in Canada and to be master licensee worldwide. Irwin Toy licensed Jenga to Schaper in the United States and when that company was bought by Hasbro, Jenga was launched under the Milton Bradley banner in 1987. Eventually, Hasbro became licensee in most countries around the world.\n\nAs of late 2017, according to Pokonobe Associates, owners of the Jenga brand, over 80 million Jenga games, equivalent to more than 4.3 billion Jenga blocks, have been sold worldwide.\n\nThe packaging copy of one edition of the Jenga game claims that Robert Grebler may have built the tallest Jenga tower ever at 40 levels. Grebler built the tower in 1985 while playing with an original Jenga set produced by Leslie Scott in the early 1980s.\n\nThrow 'n Go Jenga is a variant originally marketed by Hasbro. It consists of blocks that are various colors plus a six-sided die. It is currently marketed by Art's Ideas.\nJenga Truth or Dare was an adult variation of Jenga also marketed by Hasbro. This version looked like regular Jenga except there were three colors of blocks instead of just the natural color of Jenga. \n\nJenga Xtreme used parallelogram-shaped blocks that could create some interesting leaning towers.\n\nCasino Jenga: Las Vegas Edition employed roulette-style game play, featuring a felt game board, betting chips, and additional rules.\n\nIn addition, there have been a number of collector edition Jenga games, featuring the colors and logos of the Boston Red Sox, Oakland Raiders, New York Yankees, and John Deere, among others. Hello Kitty Jenga, Transformers Jenga, Tarzan Jenga, Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas Jenga, Donkey Kong Jenga, Bob's Burgers Jenga, National Parks Jenga, Jenga Ocean, and Walking Dead Jenga are some of the licensed variations of Jenga.\n\nJenga XXL and Jenga Giant are licensed giant Jenga games manufactured and distributed by Art's Ideas. There are Jenga Giant variations which can reach or higher in play. Jenga XXL starts at over high and can reach or higher in play. Rules are the same as in classic Jenga, except players can use two hands to move the eighteen-inch-long blocks.\n\nJenga Pass Challenge includes a handheld platform that the game is played on. Players remove a block while holding the platform, then pass the platform to the next player. This variant includes only half the number of blocks, 27, which means the tower starts at nine levels high instead of eighteen.\n\n\"Jenga World Tour\" for Nintendo Wii and DS was released by Atari on December 7, 2007. A version of the Jenga game for the Nintendo Wii from Electronic Arts was part of Hasbro's \"Family Game Night 2\" offering.\n\nAn iOS version exists, released in late 2010 by NaturalMotion Games. NaturalMotion has also released versions for Android phones and Mac computers.\n\n\n"}

It depicts events around the 24 hours of Le Mans race, based largely on a comic about the Michel Vaillant character.\n\nThe racing sequences were shot during the 2002 race.\n\nFor decades, the Vaillant family has been successfully involved in various kinds of motor racing competitions. Their most notorious driver is Michel, the son of the team's founder and owner Henri and younger brother of Jean-Pierre, the team's manager. One night, Michel's mother Elizabeth has a nightmare involving his death in an accident at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, racing against a car bearing the number 13 from Leader, a team with which the Vaillants had a historic rivalry for more than a quarter of a century. Henri conforts her, assuring that they are not planning to race at Le Mans, that Leader has been out of competition for 5 years and that no one has ever used the number 13 at the race. Meanwhile, in Canada, Michel and his best friend and teammate Steve Warson are both competing in WRC cars. Michel's victory spikes the wrath of Bob Cramer, a ruthless competing driver who is blocked by Vaillant's cars during the race. Cramer ends up threatening Michel's co-pilot, David. A few days later, Henri announces that Vaillant will have an engine at time for Le Mans, and promotes David to the driver's seat at the Rally of Italy, promising him a seat at Michel's car in the 24 hour race if he does well. In Italy, Cramer forces David out of the road, causing him to crash. David is caught in the car's explosion and dies. At the funeral, Michel meets Julie Wood, David's wife. She asks him for his husband's place at Le Mans, and Michel convinces his brother to let her on the team. Meanwhile, the Leader team returns to the competition, by the hand of Ruth, Leader's daughter. They announce that they will race at Le Mans with the number 13, hiring Bob Cramer as one of the drivers. Élisabeth worries that her nightmare can become a reality and tries to dissuade Henri from competing, but he refuses to do so. The weekend at Le Mans starts, and Ruth is determined to stop Vaillant from winning, so she sabotages the car delivery. The Vaillants barely make it on time to compete. This doesn't stop Ruth, and she kidnaps Henri, threatening to kill him if his team wins. Michel initially complies, losing a lot of time each lap. He finally tells Jean-Pierre about Ruth's plan and decides to go and save his father, asking Julie to pose as him during the race. Michel tracks his father's location through the GPS in Ruth's car, but she finds him. Michel is forced by Ruth to drive the Leader, posing as Bob Cramer after an accident puts him out of competition. Ruth and Michel find each other on the track and end up colliding violently, just like in Élisabeth's nightmare. Even though the crash was horrific, they both come out of the wreckage unharmed, and Michel goes with Steve and Julie to rescue Henri from Ruth's henchmen, who start shooting as they flee and injure Steve. The race ends with Steve's Vaillant crossing the line with a flat tire, inches before Leader's car, which had an engine failure and is being pushed by its driver. Unbeknownst to everyone, Michel was posing as Steve in the final laps. They all celebrate yet another Vaillant victory, while Ruth stares blankly in defeat.\n\n\nThe soundtrack album for the film was performed by the band, Archive, and released on November 4, 2003.\n\nCD1\n\nCD2\n\nThe film was partly shot during the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in June 2002. Event organizers added two cars to the field specifically to accommodate the filming but the production had to hire 6 professional drivers to drive the cars during the actual race.\n\nThe film was poorly received by critics, who felt it didn't honor the widely successful comics in which it was based on, underdeveloping the main characters and favoring a styilized and advert-like look. However, some of them praised its photography and exciting racing scenes. Despite a strong marketing campaign, it failed to reach 1 million viewers in France.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54042576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54042576", "title": "Montana State Fairgrounds Racetrack", "text": "Montana State Fairgrounds Racetrack\n\nThe Montana State Fairgrounds Racetrack, also known as the Lewis and Clark County Fairgrounds Racetrack and as Helena Downs, is a historic horse racing track located on the outskirts of Helena, Montana, in the United States. Constructed in 1870, the track was part of the Montana State Fairgrounds, now the Lewis and Clark County Fairgrounds. The racetrack was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 20, 2006. Portions of the track were demolished from 2006 to 2008 due to new construction on the fairgrounds.\n\nNative Americans first brought horses to the northern Great Plains in the early to mid 1700s, and horse racing among Native Americans in what later became Montana was common. Horse racing also became popular among white settlers in the area, particularly miners.\n\nSemi-formal local horse flat racing meets first occurred in Montana in Deer Lodge, Helena, and Virginia City in the 1860s. Helena's first permanent horse racing track was Madam Coady's Two-Mile House, a track located a few miles from Helena. The first Montana Territorial Fair was held at the site 1868, and included Montana's first regionally-organized horse flat race. Harness racing was added at the second Territorial Fair in 1869.\n\nIn August 1870, a group of Helena businessmen and civic leaders organized a new association, the Montana Agricultural Mineral and Mechanical Association, to host a new regional fair. Among the trustees of the new organization were such prominent Montanans as Daniel A. G. Floweree, Cornelius Hedges, Anton M. Holter, and Conrad Kohrs. The group purchased property outside Helena (at the current location of the Montana State Fairgrounds), and construction of the racetrack began immediately. The track was built according to the rules of the American Horse Congress and the California State Agricultural Society, had a home stretch, and was wide enough to accommodate eight sulkies. It is unclear if the track was a regular oval or if it had slightly distorted third and fourth turns which gave it an irregular oblong shape. At the time of its construction, it was the only regulation track in the territory.\n\nSeveral other buildings were erected about the same time as the track was constructed. Grandstands were constructed probably at the same as the track, beginning near the starting line and extending eastward. A \"paddock\" was built to the east of the grandstand, and around the first turn were three stables.\n\nRaces were held throughout the summer (not just at fair-time). They attracted horses from as far away as Salt Lake City, and even included some high-quality Kentucky thoroughbreds. By 1884, horse racing tracks had been built in Bozeman and Butte, and a \"Montana Circuit\" for horse racing had evolved. Races at Montana Circuit tracks became more exclusive, and applicant horses had to be vetted by a nomination committee before being allowed to race. The Montana Circuit eventually expanded to 15 regulation tracks. On either side of the finish line were judging stands. These are two-storied structures which gave judging officials a clear view of the finish line so that they might declare which horses won and placed in the race. Initially, these were merely covered platforms, but they were replaced several times over the years with more elaborate, permanent structures with walls, windows, and amenities.\n\nMontana became a U.S. state in 1889, and the fair was renamed the Montana State Fair in 1891 after being sold to a new group of investors. Helena horse racing continued to gain in prestige, with owners in Denver, Colorado, and Spokane, Washington, sending entries. The track was rebuilt that year. A Montana Central Railway spur reached the fairgrounds that same year, and local undocumented tradition claimed that several railroad cars of earth from Kentucky were laid on the track.\n\nThe Panic of 1893 created significant economic disruption in Montana, and the Montana State Fair shut down after the 1895 event. The fairgrounds were mortgaged, and the issuers of the loan foreclosed.\n\nHelena residents raised money in 1903 to buy the fairgrounds, which were donated to the state. By this time, the track had so deteriorated that large amounts of soil had to be trucked in to restore the turns. The state of Montana authorized a subsidized Montana State Fair in 1903, and in 1904 relay races were added. About this time, a two-story raised platform was erected just outside the first turn. This platform was used by racing officials to direct animals and riders before and after races. In 1904, the three stables were moved from the first turn to outside the far stretch and rebuilt as speed barns. A fourth speed barn and three more stables were built at some point thereafter. Two small cottages were erected about this time as well. One was against the north fence between the speed barns and stables, and another was at the end of a long shed built east of the speed barns. The cottage attached to the shed was used by the racetrack veterinarian.\n\nSignificant changes to the viewing area were made after 1904. Three sets of bleachers were erected at the racetrack between 1903 and 1914. The first (the \"long bleachers\") was erected about west of the grandstands, probably in 1904. The second set was erected between 1904 and 1913 to the west of the grandstand, and the third (the \"small bleachers\") to the west of the long bleachers, probably in 1914. The old grandstands were demolished in 1906, and replaced with larger ones. Roughly long and wide, they cost $20,000 ($ in dollars) and were capable of seating 5,000 people. Beneath the grandstands were a small jockey's dressing room (eastern end), a restaurant, and a room with betting windows.\n\nThe horse racing at the Montana State Fair began to decline after the Montana Legislature banned betting on horse races in 1914. The fair's financial situation deteriorated when the state legislature significantly cut the subsidy in 1915, and a worsening decade-long drought led to fewer paying exhibitors. A dirt automobile racing track was built in the horse racing track's infield in 1916, nestled against the first turn. Although horse racing remained popular at the fairgrounds, economic difficulties led to the fair's cancellation in 1926. Organizers managed to host only small fairs 1927 to 1932.\n\nThe ban on gambling was lifted in 1930. That year, more than 350 high-quality racehorses from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico raced at Helena, and parimutuel betting (assisted by an automatic totaliser) first occurred. The \"paddock\" was abandoned the same year, and a true, open-air paddock was built next to it.\n\nThe last Montana State Fair was held in Helena in 1932. The 1935 Helena earthquake and several fires in the 1930s and 1940s destroyed several unspecified structures associated with the horse racing track. In the fall of 1937, the three north stables and veterinarian's cottage burned down. Horse racing ended during this time, and the track was abandoned except for the small section in front of the grandstand (used as part of the automobile race track).\n\nThe largest of the four north barns was relocated to nearby Green Meadow Ranch about 1938. The remaining three north barns either burned down or were demolished by 1951. Both finish-line judging stands were removed by then as well.\n\nIn mid-1953, the Capital City Racing Association constructed a oval stock car racing track inside the 1916 automobile track. It remained in until 1956.\n\nHorse racing returned to the horse track in 1961 after organizers hosted the first Last Chance Stampede at the old fairgrounds. Some newspapers began referring to the horse track as \"Helena Downs\" at this time. Horse racing lasted until 1998, and a year later the state turned the fairgrounds over to Lewis and Clark County.\n\nThe grandstands were demolished in 2000. They had fallen into a decrepit state, and preservationists vigorously asked for them to be preserved. But the cost was too great, and the state declined to assume the cost. New modern, metal bleachers were erected in their place, and in the infield just west of the first turn. The new grandstands, designed to accommodate rodeo activities in the infield, occupied about one-eighth of the horse racing track surface. Both the second turn, home stretch, and backstretch were bulldozed to accommodate rodeo activities.\n\nThe public discussion over the grandstands led the Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Office to conduct a historic assessment of the Montana State Fairgrounds in 2003.\n\nIn 2005, the Lewis and Clark County Fair Board began consideration of a plan to reconfigured the old Montana State Fairgrounds for reuse. The plans called for a new grandstand and a large new exhibition building in the horse track infield, and demolition of the home stretch. Although there was support for the return of horse racing and restoration of the track, the fair board declined to amend the plan to accommodate it. When the county began building an access road across the horse racing track in the fall of 2005 in preparation for construction, an organization named Save the Track Foundation unsuccessfully sued to have the road stopped.\n\nIn November 2006, Lewis and Clark County voters approved a $5.7 million ($ in dollars) tax levy to implement the changes proposed by the fair board. \n\nDespite the partial blockage and demolition of the track, the horse racing track (but not any associated buildings) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in December 2006.\n\nIn 2006, the Save the Track Foundation filed several lawsuits to enjoin Lewis and Clark County from implementing its reconfiguration of the fairgrounds. The group claimed that the fair board had misled voters by failing to disclose that the horse racing track would be partially demolished and the infield used for construction. County officials said the reconfiguration plan saved most of the track for horse racing and preservation purposes, and that a lengthy planning process determined that partial demolition and use of the infield was the best use of the land given current and future needs. A Montana District Court judge declined to issue a temporary injunction halting the plan, and in March 2008 issued a formal ruling in favor of the county. The ruling allowed final construction on the new exhibition building to go forward.\n\nThe Montana State Fairgrounds Racetrack is located in the center of the fairgrounds.\n\nGrandstands, three sets of bleachers, an enclosed \"paddock\", two judging platforms, and three stables were built during the track's early history on the home stretch and first turn. Speed barns, three stables, and two cottages were built adjacent to the back stretch in the first two or three decades of the 20th century. No historic structures associated with the track's history remained as of 2006.\n\nThe Montana State Fairgrounds Racetrack was one of only three tracks west of the Mississippi River in 2005. It was reported to be the oldest of these\n"}

{"id": "625420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=625420", "title": "Paper football", "text": "Paper football\n\nPaper football (also called FIKI football, finger football, flick football, or tabletop football) refers to a table-top game, loosely based on American football, in which a sheet of paper folded into a small triangle is slid back and forth across a table top by two opponents. This game is widely practiced for entertainment, mostly by students in primary, middle school, and high school age in the United States.\n\nDue to the audience and impromptu nature of the game, a paper football is often made out of a single sheet of paper. The paper is folded similar to the way that an American flag is folded to form a triangle. First the paper is folded lengthwise two or three times to form a long rectangle. Then it is repeatedly folded in a diagonal fashion, forming a triangle. Finally, the end of the strip is tucked into the last fold, securing the final paper football in a triangular shape. \n\nIn the absence of paper, sugar packets, matchbooks, and foil-wrapped cookies have also been used to substitute for a ball.\n\nMany variations of the game exist, but generally paper football games vaguely emulate American football. The two opposing teams (usually two opposing players) sit facing each other over the play area. A coin (or, a specially-marked football) is flipped to see who kicks off to start the game. After the kickoff the teams advance the Ball by flicking it across the field. Each flick represents a drive in American football, with the goal being to score a touchdown. Games may be as simple as flicking the ball back and forth in a fashion similar to \"field goals,\" or as involved as including simulations of events from \"touchbacks\" to \"penalties\" to \"first downs\".\n\nA kick off may start the game. The player holds the football under a fingertip of one hand on his end of the table and flicks (kicks) it with a finger from the other hand towards the opposing player's end of the table. The receiving team gets possession where the ball stops. If any part of the ball is overhanging the end of the table a touchback has occurred. The receiving team gets an agreed distance away from their endzone and play continues.\n\nThere are a couple of other ways to perform the kick off; one is by placing the ball on the edge of the table with one corner overhanging, and flicking it towards the opposing side of the table. Other players use a one-handed type of kick off: the ball is held resting in the palm, then it is tossed onto the table by hitting the fingers on the underside of the table. The method used should be agreed upon before playing.\n\nSome play with a \"wind\" rule on kickoffs in which the opposing player can blow the ball backwards as \"wind.\"\n\nThe primary activity of the game is to slide the paper football across the football field by flicking it. The legal flick or shot or throw is any method which advances the ball through flicking or hitting, but pushing the ball is disallowed. The ball is generally flicked either with the thumb and forefinger in a manner similar to shooting marbles, or another manner comfortable to the player. Striking with objects such as pencils is more rare.\n\nPlayers have four chances (downs) to score a touchdown. They may attempt a field goal on fourth down.\n\nA team scores points by the following plays:\n\nA touchdown (TD) is worth 6 points, as in American football. A touchdown is scored when a player advances the ball such that it comes to rest with part of the ball extending over the edge the opponent's end of the table without falling to the ground. If the ball falls to the ground it is considered a touchback. If on fourth down a player feels that they are not close enough to have a good chance at scoring a touchdown then they can attempt a field goal for 3.\n\nWhen the players are unsure whether a touchdown has been scored, a flat object can be slid across the edge of the table nearest the ball. If the object moves the ball, a touchdown is ruled.\n\nFollowing a \"touchdown\", the scoring player usually kicks a field goal for 1 point (an \"extra point\" or \"point-after touchdown\"), or has the option to try for 2 points (a \"two-point conversion\").\nPlay resumes with either a fresh kickoff by the scoring player, or a change of possession, based on house rules.\n\nA field goal is any attempt by a player to hold the ball in one hand (which in turn generally rests on the table), and to flick the ball using the other hand such that it travels through a goalpost formed by the fingers of the opposing player. Field goals generally score 3 points. Implementation of \"field goals\" varies widely, and in some variations the game consists entirely of players kicking \"field goals\" back and forth with no other plays in between. If this is the case, each successful field goal is worth only one point.\n\nVariations:\nA safety is worth two points. This occurs when a player scores a touchdown on his/her own end of the table and not his/her opponent's end. The opposing player earns these two points.\n\nPushing the ball excessively, double flicking, kicking the ball so that it lands far away from the table, or disturbing the ball during an opponent's play may all result in penalties depending on game variation. Most often, a penalty moves the ball toward the offender's side of the table, to the opponent's advantage. If players are using \"downs\", the offending player generally loses a down (or the opponent's play is considered not to have used a down), in addition to letting the opposing player move the ball to a more advantageous position.\n\nGame length varies. A match may last a set amount of time such as 10 points or until the end of a class period in school. A match is often played until someone attains 21 points. Games are generally played quite quickly, especially when played on shorter tables.\n\nVarious methods in turn or in combination can be used to break ties. One is \"sudden death\" - if the game is tied in a timed game, the match goes into sudden death, and the player who scores first wins the game.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

The addition of Major League Baseball teams in Phoenix, Arizona, and St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1998 also created room for Minor League Baseball to expand. Two additional teams were added to the Eastern League for the 1999 season: the Altoona Curve and the Erie SeaWolves. The city of Altoona won the favor of the Eastern League over a bid from Springfield, Massachusetts. The stadium hosted its first regular season baseball game on April 15, 1999, as the Curve defeated the Bowie Baysox, 6–1.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, total seating capacity was listed at 6,176. Prior to the 2003 season, an additional 1,034 seats were created with the construction of the new left-field reserved bleacher section, the third-base picnic pavilion, and the left-field party deck.\nBlair County Ballpark hosted the Eastern League All-Star Game on July 12, 2006, before a record crowd of 9,308 fans. The largest regular-season crowd was 9,255, recorded on August 10, 2003, for a doubleheader against the Harrisburg Senators.\n\nOn January 31, 2012, it was announced that Peoples Natural Gas had signed a naming-rights deal, making the new Peoples Natural Gas Field name official. In addition, Peoples Natural Gas is conducting a study for on-site green energy.\n\nPeoples Natural Gas Field has a façade that resembles an old-fashioned railroad roundhouse that are prevalent throughout the city of Altoona. The stadium is double-decked, with the Diamond Club seating section making up the lower level. The main concourse with concessions and restrooms sits behind this section, and is covered by the upper levels of seating.\n\nPeoples Natural Gas Field is unique because of its roller coaster located beyond the right-field wall. This ride, called Skyliner, is actually part of the Lakemont Park amusement park located next door. The ridges of the Allegheny Mountains can also be viewed from inside the stadium.

It opened in 1965 and was run for about two and a half seasons. The large, futuristically designed structure gave an optimistic look for the 1960s.\n\nOriginally planned to be built for a cost of about $3 million, the facility ended up costing around $10 million. One of the proprietors and visionaries behind the park was James Dunnigan, the renowned New York horseracing financier. Various incentives during the events that were held, such as free parking and admission did initially lead to decent attendance, including an opening day showing of 12,000 people. However, a variety of factors led to the inevitable closing of the track. The hot weather of the desert caused events to be uncomfortable to attendees. The location provided limited means to control rain, leading to floods that caused accessibility problems. The park is also located about 20 miles outside of Phoenix and was built long before any major roads made the area easily accessible to those in the city or its suburbs.\n\nThough closed in 1966, the 194-acre property had been continuously owned by either individuals or corporations/businesses. And with the exception of a brief use for a movie, the property had sat abandoned since its closure. As such, without any care, maintenance, or upkeep, the property showed its age.\n\nThe main building of the park was used in the 1998 Charlie/Martin Sheen movie \"No Code of Conduct\".

This feature is mostly used in North America in National Football League contracts. Most NFL roster bonuses have trigger dates of either March 1 or June 1 of a specific future year. If the player is on the team's roster as of that date, the entire amount of the bonus must be paid, even if he is released the next day.\n\nThe roster bonus has a very specific effect on a team's \"salary cap,\" the amount of its payroll that counts toward the money permitted by league agreement.

{"id": "434184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=434184", "title": "Santa Anita Park", "text": "Santa Anita Park\n\nSanta Anita Park is a Thoroughbred racetrack in Arcadia, California, United States. It offers some of the prominent horse racing events in the United States during the winter and in spring. With its backdrop of the San Gabriel Mountains, it is considered by many the world's most beautiful race track. The track is home to numerous prestigious races including both the Santa Anita Derby and the Santa Anita Handicap as well as hosting the Breeders' Cup in 1986, 1993, 2003, 2008, 2009, and from 2012 to 2014, plus 2016. In 2010, Santa Anita's ownership was moved to MI Developments Inc. (MID).\n\nSanta Anita Park was originally part of \"Rancho Santa Anita,\" which was owned originally by former San Gabriel Mission Mayor-Domo, Claudio Lopez, and named after a family member, \"Anita Cota.\" The ranch was later acquired by rancher Hugo Reid, a Scotsman. Later, it was owned by multimillionaire horse breeder and racer Lucky Baldwin. Baldwin initially built a racetrack adjacent to the present site in what is today Arcadia, outside of the city of Los Angeles, in 1904. It closed in 1909 and burned down in 1912.\n\nIn 1933, California legalized parimutuel wagering and several investor groups worked to open racetracks. In the San Francisco area, a group headed by Dr. Charles H \"Doc\" Strub was having trouble locating a site. In the Los Angeles area, a group headed by movie producer Hal Roach was in need of further funds. These two groups combined and the newly formed Los Angeles Turf Club opened the present day track on Christmas Day in 1934, making it the first formally-established racetrack in California. Architect Gordon Kaufmann designed its various buildings in a combination of Colonial Revival and a type of art deco known as Streamline Modern, painted primarily in Santa Anita's signature colors of Persian Green and Chiffon Yellow.\n\nIn February 1935, the first Santa Anita Handicap was run. The race's $100,000 purse, largest of any race ever in the United States until that time, produced its nickname the Big 'Cap. \nIn its heyday, the track's races attracted such stars Betty Grable, Lana Turner, Edgar Bergen, Jane Russell, Cary Grant, Esther Williams, and other stars. Bing Crosby, Joe E. Brown, Al Jolson, and Harry Warner were all stockholders.\n\nUnder the leadership of Doc Strub, Santa Anita initiated many innovations that are now standard in thoroughbred horse racing, such as the use of starting gates and photo finishes for every race. Paradoxically, the implementation of photo finishes at Santa Anita recorded an increase in dead heats. Santa Anita was so successful that in its first year under Doc Strub's leadership, it paid its investors a 100% dividend on their investment.\n\nIn 1940, Seabiscuit won the Santa Anita Handicap in his last start. Two years later, in 1942, racing at Santa Anita was suspended due to the Second World War, when Santa Anita was used as an \"assembly center\" for Japanese Americans excluded from the West Coast. (See below.) For several months in 1942, over 18,000 people lived in horse stables and military-style barracks constructed on the site, including actor George Takei, then a young boy. After the track reopened in 1945, it went through the postwar years with prosperity. A downhill turf course, which added a distinctly European flair to racing at Santa Anita, was added in 1953.\n\nDue to its proximity to Los Angeles, Santa Anita has traditionally been associated with the film and television industries. The racetrack sequences in the Marx Brothers 1937 classic \"A Day at the Races\" were filmed there, and \"The Story of Seabiscuit\" with Shirley Temple was filmed on location in 1949. It was also featured in \"A Star Is Born\" (1937). Several stars, including Bing Crosby, Spencer Tracy, Errol Flynn, Alex Trebek, and MGM mogul, Louis B. Mayer, have owned horses that raced at the park.\n\nThe 1958 Santa Anita Derby was attended by 61,123 people, making the attendance that day a record crowd. They had come to watch Silky Sullivan come from 28 lengths off the pace and win—going away.\n\nThe 1960s brought about a major renovation of Santa Anita Park, including a much-expanded grandstand as well as major seating additions. In 1968, Del Mar Racetrack relinquished its dates for a fall meeting. A group of horsemen including Clement Hirsch intervened and established the not-for-profit Oak Tree Racing Association. Oak Tree had no facilities of its own and rented Santa Anita Park for its first autumn meeting in 1969. The Oak Tree Association became the operator of the autumn meet at Santa Anita Park. This meet usually ran from the end of September until early November. Many key stakes races were held during the Oak Tree Meeting, including many preps to the Breeders' Cup races. The Oak Tree meet relocated to Hollywood Park for 2010 but the California Horse Racing Board awarded the fall dates to Santa Anita in its own right in 2011. This prompted a renaming of many stakes races held at the fall meeting that were formerly associated with Oak Tree. For example, the Norfolk, Goodwood, Yellow Ribbon, Lady's Secret, and Oak Leaf, were renamed at the FrontRunner, Awesome Again, Rodeo Drive, Zenyatta and Chandelier respectively.\n\nProsperity continued at Santa Anita throughout the 1970s and the 1980s. In 1984, Santa Anita was the site of equestrian events at the 1984 Olympics. The following year, the track set an attendance record of 85,527 people on Santa Anita Handicap Day. However, recognizing the potential revenue boon to the State of California, the California Legislature expanded off track betting, bring operating betting parlors within closer driving distance of the race-day tracks. While the Santa Anita meeting could still draw large crowds, attendance had decreased by a third. Only 56,810 people were at the park for Santa Anita Derby Day 2007 to witness a Grade I event.\n\nIn 1997, Santa Anita Park was acquired by Meditrust when it purchased the Santa Anita Companies for its unique real estate investment trust paired share corporate structure. Following the elimination of the special tax treatment accorded Pair Share REITs, Meditrust sold the track to Magna Entertainment Corp. Magna still owns Santa Anita Park. In 2006, Gulfstream Park and Santa Anita cohosted the Sunshine Millions, a day of competition with $3.6 million in stakes races between horses bred in the State of Florida and those bred in the State of California.\n\nAt Santa Anita standardbred racing was also conducted.\n\nAt Santa Anita Park's European-style paddock there are statues of jockeys George Woolf, Johnny Longden, Bill Shoemaker and Laffit Pincay, Jr. plus a memorial bust of announcer Joe Hernandez and one of trainer Charlie Whittingham with his dog, Toby. There is also a lifesize bronze of Seabiscuit in the walking ring at Seabiscuit Court; a similar bronze of John Henry was unveiled near the Seabiscuit statue in December 2009. Buried near the paddock is Emperor of Norfolk, the best horse Lucky Baldwin ever owned, along with three other great Baldwin horses: Volante, Silver Cloud, and Rey El Santa Anita, all four of them winners of the prestigious American Derby. In 2012, a lifesize bronze of Zenyatta was unveiled prior to the running of the race renamed in her honor.\n\nSince 1950, Santa Anita Park has annually presented the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award to a rider who demonstrates high standards of personal and professional conduct, on and off the racetrack.\n\nSouth African native Trevor Denman served as Santa Anita's full-time announcer from the 1983 Oak Tree meet until his retirement from the position in 2015. Denman is noted for his calls beginning with \"And awaaay they go...\" and his distinctive gravelly voice. Queensland, Australia native Michael Wrona was chosen to succeed Denman in March 2016.\n\nStarting in 2014, Santa Anita began adding more racing cards due to the closure of Hollywood Park Racetrack, hosting Hollywood Park's old spring dates from late April until June.\n\nArcadia High School holds its graduation ceremonies at Santa Anita Park in June and its high school graduating class reunions, organized by the school's alumni association, in October.\n\nAfter President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized military commanders to exclude \"any or all persons\" from certain areas in the name of national defense, the Western Defense Command began ordering Japanese Americans living on the West Coast to present themselves for \"evacuation\" from the newly created military zones. Seventeen temporary \"assembly centers\" were designated to house the evicted population until construction on the more permanent and isolated internment camps was finished. Most, like Santa Anita, were converted from former uses like racing tracks or fairgrounds.\n\nSanta Anita was turned over to the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the government body responsible for oversight of the temporary detention facilities, in March 1942, and army engineers soon after built 500 barracks on the parking lot and converted the horse stables and the area underneath the grandstand into residential \"apartments.\" Inmates began arriving in April, most coming from the surrounding Los Angeles County, and the center's population soon topped 18,000, peaking at 18,719 by August of that year. Six mess halls, each seating approximately 850 at a time, fed some 3,000 people daily at a cost of 33 cents per inmate. The sanitary facilities faced similar overcrowding, with a ratio of 30 inmates to each shower \"after\" the number of showers was increased from 150 to 225 in early July. Consequently, inmates spent a significant portion of their time in Santa Anita waiting in line for meals or to use the sanitary facilities.\n\nThe Assembly Center remained open for seven months, and in the meantime, inmates took up jobs in camp at the camouflage net factory, the hospital or various administrative departments, and set up schools to ensure their children's education would not be interrupted. Transfer to War Relocation Authority camps began on August 26, 1942, when 901 inmates left for Poston, Arizona, and over the next month the remaining Japanese Americans were sent to Poston and several other camps. The Santa Anita Assembly Center closed on October 27, 1942.\n\nSanta Anita has a one-mile (1,609 m) natural dirt main track which rings a turf course measuring 0.9 mile, or . In addition, it has an unusual hillside turf course which crosses the dirt and is used mainly to run turf races at a distance of \"about\" 6½ furlongs (exact distance is ). This type of track is one of the few of its kind in America.\n\nTo comply with a State of California mandate, Santa Anita replaced its dirt racing surface with a new synthetic surface called Cushion Track, a mixture of silica sand, synthetic fibers, elastic fiber, granulated rubber and a wax coating. The new Cushion Track opened for training on Sept 4, 2007 and hosted its first live race on Sept 26, 2007. The track lost 11 racing dates in 2008 due to a drainage problem with the new material, but intensive maintenance and the addition of a liquid binder greatly improved the artificial surface. Santa Anita replaced the artificial surface with a return to an all natural dirt surface in December 2010.\n\nSanta Anita occupies . It has a -long grandstand, which is a historic landmark that seats 26,000 guests. The grandstand facade is rendered in an Art Deco style and is largely the original from the 1930s. The track infield area, which resembles a park with picnic tables and large trees, can accommodate 50,000 or more guests. The Park also contains 61 barns, which house more than 2,000 horses, and an equine hospital.\n\nIn 2000, the racetrack was named to America's \"Most Endangered Historic Places\" list. The Santa Anita Racetrack was determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in 2006, but continued to be threatened by developer's plans. A themed entertainment complex proposal was aborted, but there were new plans are in the works for the parking and support areas adjacent to the historic race track and grandstands.\n\nIn 2006, there was a proposal to close Santa Anita Park and use its location as the site of a new retail/entertainment complex. The Arcadia City Council approved a plan In April 2007 to develop an 830,000 square foot commercial, retail, and office complex in the south parking area, where the barracks that housed interned Japanese Americans during World War II are located. The proposal planned to tear down the South Ticket Gate and the 1938 Saddling Barn, and to install a simulcast facility in the center of the historic grandstand. In April 2008, a plan was approved to use large parts of the existing track parking lot to construct a mall, the \"Shops at Santa Anita\"\n\n, the plans to build another mall next to Santa Anita Park were abandoned. Protests against the project by the Westfield group, owner of the adjacent Westfield Santa Anita Mall (built in 1974 on the site of the old barns and training track), and the bankruptcy of Magna International, owner of Santa Anita Park, were a factor in the decision.\n\nTVG, which acquired Horse Racing TV (HRTV) in 2015, is a 24-hour television based multimedia network dedicated to horse racing which features racing action from many of the sport's greatest racetracks around the world.\nTVG broadcasts live from Santa Anita Park.\n\nTalents from HRTV are now employed by TVG Network or XBTV (Xpressbet TV).

Savage Hall and Centennial Hall) is a multi-purpose arena located in Toledo, Ohio, on the campus of the University of Toledo. The arena opened in 1976 and originally seated 9,000 for basketball and up to 10,000 for concerts. As part of a $30 million renovation and addition to the arena, completed in 2008, the seating capacity was reduced to 7,300 for basketball and up to 8,300 for concerts. It primarily serves as the home venue for the Toledo Rockets men's and women's basketball teams and women's volleyball team, and also hosts concerts, commencement exercises, and other events.\n\nSavage Arena features of space on its arena floor, large enough to accommodate an ice rink, an arena football field, a rodeo ring, five basketball courts, eight volleyball courts, five tennis courts, six racquetball courts, 22 badminton courts, and a 300-yard (274 m) indoor track. There is also a 48x56 foot portable stage. The Joe Grogan Room, which seats 200 for dinners, is located at the arena's south side, above the running track. The glass-enclosed room contains a lounge and a bar. More than $350,000 was spent on building and equipping the Joe Grogan Room. All funds for the room were raised through $5,000 pledges by members of the Rocket Club, the athletic department's main support group that now totals more than 1,000 members.\n\nThe arena is built with long span trusses that support the roof, above the arena floor. The trusses also support the arena's public address and ventilation systems, a catwalk system for service and maintenance, and the arena's center-court scoreboard. The arena is named for John F. Savage, a university alum (Class of 1952) who was instrumental in the arena's construction. The free span is from wall to wall. The building structure and wall systems are constructed of noncombustible material.\n\nIn the first game played in Savage Arena, the men's basketball team defeated defending NCAA champion Indiana 59–57. With that win, the Rockets snapped Bobby Knight and the Hoosiers' 33-game winning streak. At Savage Hall, Toledo has beaten Ohio State, Xavier, Cincinnati, Houston and Pittsburgh. The longest consecutive winning streak by the Rockets in Savage Arena is 16 games, during the 1978–79 season. During that streak, UT outscored opponents by an average of 17 points per game. Between November 30, 1978 and December 1, 1981, the Rockets recorded a 45–3 (.938) home record. Prior to the 1985–86 season, they had lost back-to-back games at home only twice in 146 contests.\n\nToledo has won 73.5% of its games at home, posting a 312–112 record. During the first five years in Savage Arena, UT posted a 71–10 (.877) record, with a 15–1 mark in 1976–77 and 1978–79 and a 14–1 slate in 1979–80. Under former head coach Stan Joplin, the Rockets were 84–22 (.792) at Savage Arena. The Rockets have also ranked among the MAC leaders in attendance, averaging 6,640 fans per game since the arena opened in 1976. Last year, Toledo led the MAC with an average attendance of 5,292.\n\nIn 1980–81, the Rockets set a school record with 147,203 in total attendance, the 30th-best total in the nation, and during the 1999–2000 season the Rockets eclipsed the 2,500,000 attendance mark in arena history.\n\nIn addition to the activity areas, Savage Arena contains athletic department offices, a reception area, press room, sports medicine and therapy rooms, laundry and equipment facilities and locker rooms with showers and saunas for both men and women. It is also the site of convocations and commencement ceremonies, as well as the occasional conventions.\n\nThe facility has hosted five Mid-American Conference men's basketball tournaments: 1985, 1987–1989, and 1995. In addition, the arena hosted U.S. President George W. Bush and Mexican president Vicente Fox in 2001. World Championship Wrestling used Savage Arena as its Toledo stop until its 2001 folding. \n\nAmong the many performers who have played Savage Arena over the years have been Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, Boyz II Men, Steve Winwood, Rod Stewart, Phil Collins, Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Sheryl Crow, Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Van Halen, Alabama, Charlie Daniel's, The Judds, John Schneider and, more recently, Chris Brown, Katy Perry, The Black Keys, P!nk, Eric Church and American Idols Live!. Of note, Savage Arena hosted Crystal Bowersox's homecoming performance when it hosted the 2010 edition of the latter show. As part of their Promises Tour, the Christian rock band Sanctus Real had their homecoming concert at Savage Arena in 2013. Kiss (band) performed at the arena during their 1997 Reunion Tour, a professionally shot recording of which has been widely bootlegged.\n\nOn July 17, 2006, a gift of $5 million, the largest single gift ever made to the UT athletic department, was donated and earmarked for use on the new Savage Hall update project. These funds were used along with those obtained in a capital raising campaign in order to make major repairs and upgrades to the facility, including an all new athletic center. Final plans included new locker rooms, weight rooms, a pro shop, a Rocket Hall-of-Fame, new ticket offices and a professional office area, as well as revamping of the main arena area which modernized every aspect of the Savage Hall experience. The complex was also renamed Savage Arena. The renovations, which totaled $30 million, were completed in time for the 2008-09 basketball season.\n\nThere are also plans in the works to attach an enclosed indoor practice complex for both the basketball and football teams.\n\n\n"}

With the Territorial Draft, local college or professional football players, would end up playing for the state's USFL team.\n\nEach team was assigned a five college pool that were deemed to be in the team's region, from which it could select a predetermined number of players.\n\nThe territorial selections were conducted by the teams, who communicated their choices to the league's office in writing. Once \"drafted\", a player's USFL rights belonged to that club, and were ineligible from selection in the regular college draft. \n\nThe league's office in turn would send out these lists to all teams, prohibiting them from drafting these players in the regular college draft.\n\n"}
{"id": "52561025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52561025", "title": "Valerio Ciccone", "text": "Valerio Ciccone\n\nValerio Ciccone (born Melbourne 1970) is an Australian artist who is best known for his drawings of mass-media events and icons taken from popular culture. He has worked from his Northcote-based studio at Arts Project Australia since 1984, where he has also had numerous solo shows. He has exhibited widely, both nationally and internationally [see Exhibitions] and his work is held in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia, MADMusée, Liège, and the National Sports Museum.\n\nCiccone grew up in the semi-rural suburb of Yarrambat, the third of four children. According to his mother, he began “drawing obsessively” from the age of four or five, and even at this young age his key source of imagery was taken from the mass media (television and newspapers). It was during his childhood that he began creating his collection of rendered logos from favourite television shows, a collection he has continued to expand throughout his life, alongside others, including a collection of music cassettes which extends to over 1000 objects. Ciccone has demonstrated an extraordinary memory for these collections (which remain unlabelled and yet are perfectly organised and accessible for him) and an ability to recall the names of individual persons met briefly, over periods stretching many years. This ability has been noted as a key component of his artwork, informing the connections he draws between figures of public life and popular culture, and the attention to detail in his technical execution.\n\nIn 1984 Ciccone was one of the first artists to take up a studio residency at Arts Project Australia (APA), an organisation devoted to supporting and promoting artists with an intellectual disability. Although he has received little formal training, his participation in the studio program at APA provided him with access to fine art materials and the informal tuition provided by the practicing artists employed by the organisation. He also spent a number of years attending weekly drawing classes at the School of Art at RMIT University. Ciccone’s early works were in watercolour and in the early 1990s he produced a series of monochrome drawings featuring imagery and text taken directly from newspapers. Following a serious illness in 1993 and a lengthy period of rehabilitation, his work underwent a significant change as he introduced colour to his palette. During this time he produced artworks centred on the actions and heroics of Australian Rules Football players, one of which has been acquired for the permanent collection of the National Sports Museum.\n\nGlenn Barkley, Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia, has described Ciccone’s “obsessive engagement” with television and mass media presentations of sporting events as being a quintessential trait of his generation, stating that for “Generation X,” there is “little difference between what we might watch and how we might feel.” He notes the manner in which Ciccone democratises his subjects, describing an oeuvre of works in which “cathedrals are as important as the corner of a studio and lions lie with mice, and elephants, and koala bears.” However, Barkley is careful to point out that Ciccone’s works are not flippant; he attributes his use of low-brow televisual imagery to a project which elevates and finds meaning in banal aspects of contemporary life, claiming that he “celebrates the mundane, the disposable and finds it beautiful.” Stylistically, Ciccone’s rendering of mass media personages and events in soft, layered pastel, work towards this elevation of his subject, transforming the “flatness of newsprint or flickering image on the screen” into something “warm and personal.”\n\nAlthough best known for his works in pastel on paper, Ciccone has worked in a range of mediums including painting, printmaking, ceramics and digital animation. His work has been categorised within the genre of Outsider Art and has been included in Outsider Art exhibitions and fairs, both in Australia and in the USA. However, in recent years his work has also achieved success in more conventional art institutions and has been acquired for major permanent collections at the National Gallery of Australia (Print Archive) and MADMusée, Liège, Belgium.\n\n\"Valerio Ciccone\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2014\n\n\"Valerio Ciccone\": Peripheral Observer, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2012\n\n\"Ball!\" Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 1999\n\n\"Works by Valerio Ciccone\", Pinacotheca, Melbourne, 1996\n\n\"Works on Paper by Valerio Ciccone\", Pinacotheca, 1994.\n\nred ball: the fine art of footy, Red Gallery, Fitzroy North, Melbourne, 2016\n\n\"The 64th Blake Prize\", Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre, Casula, NSW, 2016\n\n\"After…\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2015\n\n\"Melbourne Art Fair\", Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne, 1994 – 2014\n\n\"Renegades: Outsider Art\", national travelling exhibition, 2013 – 2014\n\n\"Into the Vault and Out of the Box\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2014\n\n\"Video Doctor\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2013\n\n\"Classic Albums\", Tank Art Centre, Cairns, QLD, 2013,\n\n\"Classic Albums\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2012\n\n\"Fresh off the press\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2011\n\n\"This Sensual World\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2011\n\n\"Fred, Ginger and Other Stories\", Delmar Gallery, Ashfield, 2011\n\n\"Portrait Exchange\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2010\n\n\"Pictures of You\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2009\n\n\"BloodLines: Art and the Horse\", national travelling exhibition, 2007 – 2009\n\n\"Pearls of Arts Project Australia: The Stuart Purves Collection\", national travelling exhibition, 2007 – 2009\n\n\"Portraits of Artists\", Place Gallery, Richmond, Melbourne, 2008\n\n\"Behind the Scenes\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2008\n\n\"The Dinner Party\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2007\n\n\"Yours, Mine and Ours\": 50 Years of ABC TV, Penrith Regional Gallery & The Lewers Bequest, Penrith, 2006\n\n\"Leo Cussen with Selected Artists\", Australian Galleries, Collingwood, 2005\n\n\"10th Sydney Art on Paper F\"air, Byron Kennedy Hall, Moore Park, Sydney, 2005\n\n\"Amour, gloire et beauté\", MADMusée, Liège, Belgium, 2005\n\n\"Artists’ Books\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2005\n\n\"Figures humaines\", Galerie du MAD, Liège, Belgium, 2004\n\n\"2nd Annual Intuit Show of Folk and Outsider Art\", Chicago, United States, Hosted by the Phyllis Kind Gallery, New York, 2004\n\n\"Printed Matter\", Arts Project Australia, Melbourne, 2004\n\n\"Fair Game\", The Ian Potter Centre; NGV Australia Response Gallery\n\n\"A Sense of Place\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2003\n\n\"Articulations\", Australian Print Workshop, Melbourne, 2000\n\n\"Arterial\", Paralympic Arts Festival, Studio Foyer, Sydney Opera House, Sydney, 2000\n\n\"On Track\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2000\n\n\"Works on Paper\", Australian Galleries, Sydney, 1999\n\n\"Connexions Particulières\", , Liège, Belgium, 1999\n\n\"The Inner View\", Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 1999\n\n\"Ball!
