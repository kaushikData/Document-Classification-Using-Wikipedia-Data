Based in Honolulu, HI, AccesSurf was founded in 2006. Their mission is to “empower people with disabilities by providing adaptive surfing and therapeutic educational programs on water recreation and enriches lives by helping families to access the beach and ocean in a barrier free environment.” AccesSurf educates the general public about how to help people with disabilities and provide the resources necessary to create the opportunities. They have created programs locally and nationally to assist anyone with a physical disability or cognitive disability in the water environment. For the fiscal year of 2013, AccesSurf netted $104,960 with their asset amount of $112,408.\n\nAccesSurf was founded in 2006 in Honolulu, Hi by Mark Marbles. With the help of friends and family, Marbles wanted to create an area where people with disabilities could come out and enjoy the beach. AccesSurf started with their program “Day at the Beach” and eventually expanded by creating a “Wounded Warrior Day at the Beach”. With the growth of both of these events, AccesSurf became the first accredited Paralympic Sports Club in Hawaii in 2012.\n\nAccesSurf offers a wide variety of programs such as the “Day at the Beach” and the “Wounded Warrior Day at the Beach” and is also part of the only Paralympic Sports Club in Hawaii.\n\nThe “Day at the Beach” program is a free monthly service provided by trained volunteers to introduce adaptive aquatic recreation using specialized surfboards, wave skis, and flotation devices for anyone with a physical disability or cognitive disability. Due to the struggle that persons with disabilities and their families experience when attempting to access the beach, AccesSurf repurposed military industrial mats (Mobi-Mats) to create a wheelchair- and stroller-accessible beach path. Along with equipment, AccesSurf provides specially-trained professionals. The intention of the program is to allow people to have a fun and realizing day without having to worry about disabilities.\n\nSimilar to “Day at the Beach,” the “Wounded Warrior Day at the Beach” is another service offered by AccesSurf. This service is for veterans who have been classified Wounded Warriors.\n\nIn 2012, AccesSurf became the first accredited Paralympic Sports Club in Hawaii. With the help of swim coaches from Swim Mechanix, AccesSurf was able to develop swim clinics both in the pool and the ocean.\n\nAccesSurf and its volunteers have been invited to help and sponsor athletes in the first ever adaptive surfing world championship held in La Jolla, California in September 2015.\n\n"}

It was re-opened for the 2011–12 summer season, having undergoing a major refurbishment during 2011. In 1968, the pool, previously called the new Domain Baths, was renamed in honour of Andrew \"Boy\" Charlton, an Australian swimmer who won five Olympic medals during the 1920s.\n\nSince the first European settlement in Sydney there have been 11 different bathing establishments in Woolloomooloo Bay. In the early years, the small sandy beach where the Andrew \"Boy\" Charlton Pool now stands was reserved for the exclusive use of the military of NSW including the Marines, the New South Wales Corps and any British regiments stationed here.\n\nIn the 1820s the use of Woolloomooloo Bay by others was increasing. Two hulks, \"Ben Bolt\" and the \"Cornwallis\" were moored at the swimming place then known as the Fig Tree. Some dressing sheds were also built but the swimming area was not enclosed.\n\nThe first swimming facility planned for the area was a floating public baths called Robinson's Hot and Cold Baths. Thomas Robinson was granted a lease for the area in December 1829 but construction of the baths took another ten years to complete.\n\nBeating Robinson to the jump was the wife of Governor Macquarie's coachman, Mrs Biggs. She opened the first ladies baths, which included a bathing machine, in 1833 on a small flat inlet near the north-western corner of Cowper Wharf. The baths went out of operation in the late 1840s.\n\nIn November 1843, Robinson's baths reopened after a refurbishment which included deepening the ladies pool and the introduction of a shallow children's’ area. Warm showers and a towel were also available for all bathers.\n\nIt was in the \"Gentlemen's Baths\" that Australia's the first official competitive swimming events took place. On 14 February 1846 two races were held, an open event over 440 yards (won by W. Redman in a time of 8 min 43 sec) and a 100-yard event for juveniles. Annual championships were held here for some years afterwards.\n\nIn 1850 the Fig Tree baths and what was left of Mrs Biggs’ women's baths were granted by the Government to Sydney Council with the intention that the Council build new baths on the site. However, with the dismissal of the council in 1853 the project stalled.\n\nIn 1854 Mrs Macquarie's Road was opened to horse-drawn vehicles improving access to the baths. Towards the end of the 1850s Sydney Council, or \"Corporation\" as it was known, built new baths around the wharf at Fig Tree which projected into Woolloomooloo Bay.\n\nThis brought to three the sets of baths in the bay at this time. In addition to the Corporation Baths was a Ladies Baths (not Mrs Biggs’ although near her former site) and a fully enclosed Gentlemen's Baths. Although the Corporation Baths were still there in 1888, more than 30 years later, they were largely unusable because of sewerage discharged into Woolloomooloo Bay. By 1890 there were four baths; the Corporation had a ladies and a gentleman's baths and there were also independent ladies and gentleman's baths.\n\nIn 1901, since the sewer had been diverted to Bondi and no longer emptied into Sydney Harbour at Woolloomooloo, the State Government extended the lease for the baths with Sydney Council. Funding was also provided to remove the haphazard collection of bathing buildings which had accumulated over the years and construct a new baths. These were officially opened in October 1908 and consisted of a fenced swimming area and concrete platform over the old stone one attached to the shore. Another fence provided privacy from the path and there was a timber and corrugated iron change shed.\n\nApart from Australia's first swimming races, the most memorable event to take place in the Domain Baths was in January 1924 when Andrew \"Boy\" Charlton swam against Arne Borg of Sweden. A crowd of 6000 came to see him beat Borg over 440 yards, equal Borg's world record and set a new Australian record.\n\nCharlton was already very popular in New South Wales when he took on Borg. At the age of 14 he beat Hawaiian swimmer Bill Harris over 880 yards setting a new world record in the process. At 15 years of age he beat Olympic swimmer Frank Beaurepaire and won the NSW 800m freestyle title in world record time talking 19 seconds off the old mark. It was his win over Borg, however, that launched him to national stardom. To show that it was no fluke he beat Borg again over 220 yards and 880 yards at the NSW Championships.\n\nCharlton went on to win the gold medal in the 1500m freestyle event at the Paris Olympics later that year and silver in the 400m and 1500m events at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nHis 1924 world record in the Domain baths was the first set there, an achievement which was recognised in January 1968 when, after yet another refurbishment, the pool was reopened and named after him.\n\n\n\n"}

A football drama about the star striker of the national team, who, after a loud failure, leaves the big sport. But he is not able to renounce his vocation and becomes the coach of an unknown team. While teaching it the art of defeating opponents the hero himself learns to conquer his internal breakdowns.\n\nThe forward of the Russian national team Yuri Stoleshnikov makes a mistake in an important match - he does not score a penalty. A scandal erupts, as a result of which Yuri finishes his playing career and leaves for a small town where he accepts the offer to start coaching at the local football club Meteor.\n\nAs a trainer of Meteor, Stoleshnikov will have to start believing in himself again, and rehabilitation doctor Varya will play an important role in this.\n\nThis film is the directorial and screenwriting debut of Danila Kozlovsky.\n\nInitially Danila Kozlovsky thought that he would participate in the project only as an actor and producer. However, in the end, he also became the director of the project, as well as a co-author of the script.\n\nDanila Kozlovsky previously played the role of a football player in the film \"Garpastum\" (2005) directed by Aleksei German Jr.\n\nOlga Zueva, who worked with Danila Kozlovsky in the film \"In the Hood\" (2018), initially asked for the role of Varya. But Danila felt that she did not fit in the style and image, and continued to look for another performer. Meanwhile, Olga Zueva reworked the script, giving the character of her character more strength, courage and a bit of eccentricity. The director positively evaluated the proposals and approved the actress for the role.\n\nAll the workers of the set were dressed in the branded jackets of the Meteor team. If the camera captured one of them when shooting, that person fit into the frame as an employee of the club.\n\nThe project was created with the support of the Ministry of Sport of the Russian Federation, the Russian Football Union and personally Vitaly Mutko. Also the film received financial support from the Cinema Foundation of Russia.\nAbout three thousand professional football players auditioned for a role in the picture, from whom the creators of the project selected about 200 people. Among them were Alan Gatagov and Dmitri Sychev; the latter compared Kozlovsky with Guus Hiddink based on the results of the shooting, who combining exactingness and democracy, managed to lead the national team to bronze medals of Euro 2008. For two months, the team, assembled from athletes and professional actors, lived on a tough athletic regimen. Kozlovsky trained with them too.\n\nThe filming process continued in 2017. The training base of FC \"Meteor\" was shot at the Central Stadium of Novorossiysk - the home arena of FC Chernomorets. In total, six football stadiums were used in the film, including \"Otkritie Arena\", \"Arena Khimki\" and \"Krasnodar Stadium\".\n\nAccording to the calculations of the magazine \"StarHit\", the cost of the crowd scenes amounted to about 5 million rubles. The production budget of the film is 390 million rubles, the projected gross - 680 million rubles.\n\n"}

His performances for the national under-23s instigated a move to Indera SC for the second half of the 2017 Super League season, and found regular playing time there. At the end of the season, he became the league's Best Player by helping Indera to third place, despite only at the club halfway through.\n\nIn February 2018, Haimie joined Brunei's professional side DPMM FC after impressing new head coach Renê Weber at a pre-season trial.

He was not selected for the 2016 AFF Championship qualification matches, nor the 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup; Ishyra Asmin Jabidi was chosen instead.\n\nHaimie's luck made an upturn in 2017 when he was selected to play ahead of Ishyra for the first match of the 2018 AFC U-23 Championship qualification held in Myanmar in July for the Brunei under-23s, against regional giants Australia. He performed admirably, keeping out the Olyroos' 10 chances in the first half alone, before a 53rd-minute penalty by George Blackwood and a Riley McGree strike in the last five minutes sank the Young Wasps to a 2–0 defeat. He drew praise from opposition coach Josep Gombau and subsequently kept his place for the remainder of the tournament.\n\nThe following month, the Under-23s competed in the 29th SEA Games held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Haimie started the opening game of the tournament against the hosts and once again kept the scoreline to a minimum, only conceding twice to the Young Tigers. Two defeats to Myanmar and Laos followed where he let in nine unanswered goals. He was benched for Ishyra in the last deadwood game against Singapore.\n\nIn December 2017, Haimie was recalled to the national team for the 2017 Aceh World Solidarity Tsunami Cup and played in the 4–0 loss against Indonesia. The next year, he was selected for the 2018 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification matches against Timor-Leste in early September. He gained his first full national team cap on 1 September in the first leg at Kuala Lumpur in a 3–1 loss.

Athletes would hold the javelin by the thong and when the javelin was released this thong unwound giving the javelin a spiraled flight.\n\nThrowing javelin-like poles into targets was revived in Germany and Sweden in the early 1870s. In Sweden, these poles developed into the modern javelin, and throwing them for distance became a common event there and in Finland in the 1880s. The rules continued to evolve over the next decades; originally, javelins were thrown with no run-up, and holding them by the grip at the center of gravity was not always mandatory. Limited run-ups were introduced in the late 1890s, and soon developed into the modern unlimited run-up.\n\nSweden's Eric Lemming, who threw his first world best (49.32 meters) in 1899 and ruled the event from 1902 to 1912, was the first dominant javelin thrower. When the men's javelin was introduced as an Olympic discipline at the 1906 Intercalated Games, Lemming won by almost nine metres and broke his own world record; Sweden swept the first four places, as Finland's best throwers were absent and the event had yet to become popular in any other country. Though challenged by younger talents, Lemming repeated as Olympic champion in 1908 and 1912; his eventual best mark (62.32 m, thrown after the 1912 Olympics) was the first javelin world record to be officially ratified by the International Association of Athletics Federations.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, most javelin competitions were two-handed; the implement was thrown with the right hand and separately with the left hand, and the best marks for each hand were added together. Competitions for the better hand only were less common, though not unknown. At the Olympics a both-hands contest was held only once, in 1912; Finland swept the medals, ahead of Lemming. After that, this version of the javelin rapidly faded into obscurity, together with similar variations of the shot and the discus; Sweden's Yngve Häckner, with his total of 114.28 m from 1917, was the last official both-hands world record holder.\n\nAnother early variant was the freestyle javelin, in which holding the javelin by the grip at the center of gravity was not mandatory; such a freestyle competition was held at the 1908 Olympics, but was dropped from the program after that. Hungary's Mór Kóczán used a freestyle end grip to break the 60-meter barrier in 1911, a year before Lemming and Julius Saaristo first did so with a regular grip.\n\nThe first known women's javelin marks were recorded in Finland in 1909. Originally, women threw the same implement as men; a lighter, shorter javelin for women was introduced in the 1920s. Women's javelin throw was added to the Olympic program in 1932; Mildred \"Babe\" Didrikson of the United States became the first champion.\n\nFor a long time, javelins were made of solid wood, typically birch, with a steel tip. The hollow, highly aerodynamic Held javelin, invented by American thrower Bud Held and developed and manufactured by his brother Dick, was introduced in the 1950s; the first Held javelins were also wooden with steel tips, but later models were made entirely of metal. These new javelins flew further, but were also less likely to land neatly point first; as a response to the increasingly frequent flat or ambiguously flat landings, experiments with modified javelins started in the early 1980s. The resulting designs, which made flat landings much less common and reduced the distances thrown, became official for men starting in April 1986 and for women in April 1999, and the world records (then 104.80 m by Uwe Hohn, and 80.00 m by Petra Felke) were reset. The current () men's world record is held by Jan Železný at 98.48 m (1996); Barbora Špotáková holds the women's world record at 72.28 m (2008).\n\nOf the 69 Olympic medals that have been awarded in the men's javelin, 32 have gone to competitors from Norway, Sweden or Finland. Finland is the only nation to have swept the medals at a currently recognized official Olympics, and has done so twice, in 1920 and 1932, in addition to its 1912 sweep in the two-handed javelin; in 1920 Finland swept the first four places, which is no longer possible as only three entrants per country are allowed. Finland has, however, never been nearly as successful in the women's javelin.\n\nThe javelin throw has been part of the decathlon since the decathlon was introduced in the early 1910s; the all-around, an earlier ten-event contest of American origin, did not include the javelin throw. The javelin was also part of some (though not all) of the many early forms of women's pentathlon, and has always been included in the heptathlon after it replaced the pentathlon in 1981.\n\nThe size, shape, minimum weight, and center of gravity of the javelin are all defined by IAAF rules. In international competition, men throw a javelin between in length and in weight, and women throw a javelin between in length and in weight. The javelin has a grip, about wide, made of cord and located at the javelin's center of gravity ( from the javelin tip for the men's javelin and from the javelin tip for the women's javelin).\n\nUnlike the other throwing events (shot put, discus, and hammer), the technique used to throw the javelin is dictated by IAAF rules and \"non-orthodox\" techniques are not permitted. The javelin must be held at its grip and thrown overhand, over the athlete's shoulder or upper arm. Further, the athlete is prohibited from turning completely around such that his back faces the direction of throw. In practice, this prevents athletes from attempting to spin and hurl the javelin sidearm in the style of a discus throw. This rule was put in place when a group of athletes began experimenting with a spin technique referred to as \"free style\". On 24 October 1956, Pentti Saarikoski threw using the technique holding the end of the javelin. Officials were so afraid of the out of control nature of the technique that the practice was banned through these rule specifications.\n\nInstead of being confined to a circle, javelin throwers have a runway wide and at least in length, ending in a curved arc from which their throw will be measured; athletes typically use this distance to gain momentum in a \"run-up\" to their throw. Like the other throwing events, the competitor may not leave the throwing area (the runway) until after the implement lands. The need to come to a stop behind the throwing arc limits both how close the athlete can come to the line before the release as well as the maximum speed achieved at the time of release.\n\nThe javelin is thrown towards a \"sector\" covering an angle of 28.96 degrees extending outwards from the arc at the end of the runway. A throw is legal only if the tip of the javelin lands within this sector, and the tip strikes the ground before any other part of the javelin. The distance of the throw is measured from the throwing arc to the point where the tip of the javelin landed, rounded down to the nearest centimeter.\n\nCompetition rules are similar to other throwing events: a round consists of one attempt by each competitor in turn, and competitions typically consist of three to six rounds. The competitor with the longest single legal throw (over all rounds) is the winner; in the case of a tie the competitors' second-longest throws are also considered. Competitions involving large numbers of athletes sometimes use a \"cut\": all competitors compete in the first three rounds, but only athletes who are currently among the top eight or have achieved some minimum distances are permitted to attempt to improve on their distance in additional rounds (typically three).\n\nOn 1 April 1986, the men's javelin () was redesigned by the governing body (the IAAF Technical Committee). They decided to change the rules for javelin design because of the increasingly frequent flat landings and the resulting discussions and protests when these attempts were declared valid or invalid by competition judges. The world record had also crept up to a potentially dangerous level, by Uwe Hohn. With throws exceeding 100 meters, it was becoming difficult to safely stage the competition within the confines of a stadium infield. The javelin was redesigned so that the centre of gravity was moved forward. In addition, the surface area in front of centre of gravity was reduced, while the surface area behind the centre of gravity was increased. This had an effect similar to that produced by the feathers on an arrow. The javelin turns into the relative wind. This relative wind appears to originate from the ground as the javelin descends, thus the javelin turns to face the ground. As the javelin turns into the wind less lift is generated, reducing the flight distance by around 10% but also causing the javelin to stick in the ground more consistently. In 1999, the women's javelin () was similarly redesigned.\n\nModifications that manufacturers made to recover some of the lost distance, by increasing tail drag (using holes, rough paint or dimples), were forbidden at the end of 1991 and marks made using implements with such modifications removed from the record books. Seppo Räty had achieved a world record of in 1991 with such a design, but this record was nullified.\n\nThe weight of the javelin in the Under-20 category is the same as the senior level.\n\nUnlike other throwing events, javelin allows the competitor to build speed over a considerable distance. In addition to the core and upper body strength necessary to deliver the implement, javelin throwers benefit from the agility and athleticism typically associated with running and jumping events. Thus, the athletes share more physical characteristics with sprinters than with others, although they still need the skill of heavier throwing athletes.\n\nTraditional free-weight training is often used by javelin throwers. Metal-rod exercises and resistance band exercises can be used to train a similar action to the javelin throw to increase power and intensity. Without proper strength and flexibility, throwers can become extremely injury prone, especially in the shoulder and elbow. Core stability can help in the transference of physical power and force from the ground through the body to the javelin. Stretching and sprint training are used to enhance the speed of the athlete at the point of release, and subsequently, the speed of the javelin. At release, a javelin can reach speeds approaching 113 km/h (70 mph).\n\nDue to the fear of liability, the javelin throw is not an event in NFHS high school competition in 36 states, though USATF youth competitions for the same aged athletes do hold javelin competitions. At various points in time, high schools have attempted to create substitute events, including the softball throw, football throw and the grenade throw, throwing different objects under rules similar to javelin throw rules. In those states that do allow high school javelin competition, a few specify that the tip must be of rubber. Further, in age group track meets in the U.S., and in particular with elementary-school children in the Northeast, the Turbojav—a smaller plastic implement with a rubber tip but with similar flying characteristics as a real javelin—is a popular alternative.\n\nJavelin throwers have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the €5 Finnish 10th IAAF World Championships in Athletics commemorative coin, minted in 2005 to commemorate the 2005 World Championships in Athletics. On the obverse of the coin, a javelin thrower is depicted. On the reverse, legs of hurdle runners with the Helsinki Olympic Stadium tower in the background can be seen.\n\n\n\nMarks set using dimpled rough-tailed javelins manufactured by several companies were nullified effective 20 September 1991.\n\nA new model was introduced in 1986, and all records started fresh.\n\nA new model was introduced in 1999 and all records started fresh.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the home ground of Notts County, who have played there since 1910. The stadium was also home to Notts County Ladies F.C. from 2014 until 2017.\n\nIt currently has an all-seated capacity of 19,841 for Football League games. The record attendance is 47,310, who watched Notts lose 1–0 to York City in the FA Cup Sixth Round on 12 March 1955.\n\nMeadow Lane lies just away from the City Ground, home of Nottingham Forest. The two grounds are the closest in England and the second-closest in the United Kingdom after the grounds of Dundee and Dundee United. The Trent End of the City Ground is visible from parts of the Jimmy Sirrel stand and the Spion Kop.\n\nThe stadium also hosts the men's and women's football in the Varsity Series – a sporting series contested by Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham.\n\nPrior to 1910, Notts County played their home games across the River Trent at Trent Bridge as a tenant of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. Cricket took priority on the ground and the football club were often forced to play early and late season fixtures at other venues to avoid a clash.\n\nThe Football League eventually deemed that this practice was inappropriate and demanded that Notts either seek more favourable terms for the use of Trent Bridge or relocate to a new ground on which they could fulfil all of their fixtures.\n\nIn 1910, a plot of land near the cattle market on the opposite side of the River Trent was leased from the city council and a new stadium hastily erected. Part of the new stadium was a temporary stand from Trent Bridge which was literally floated across the river.\n\nOn 3 September 1910, County moved to Meadow Lane, the first game was a 1–1 draw with old rivals Nottingham Forest, played in front of fans paying receipts of £775.\n\nIn 1920 the landlord, Nottingham Corporation, which leased the land to the club, came very close to removing the club from its premises to make way for an abattoir.\n\nThe stadium remained largely the same until 1923 when the Sneinton Side was replaced with a new stand, named the County Road Stand after the newly constructed road behind it.\n\nMeadow Lane was bombed during World War II forcing the club to suspend all fixtures during the 1942 season. The northern side of the Main Stand was badly damaged and the pitch left in an unplayable condition.\n\nThe stadium has played host to Forest games on a number of occasions. After the war, when flooding from the River Trent left the City Ground in an unplayable condition and again in 1968 when the Main Stand at the City Ground was destroyed by fire in a game against Leeds United.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s the stadium became increasingly dilapidated. The Meadow Lane End was demolished in 1978 and replaced by a building which housed new dressing rooms, a social club and a variety of other facilities designed to generate more income. There was no stand at this end for several years and Meadow Lane was reduced to a three sided ground. Eventually a small terrace was installed on this side. The Bradford City stadium fire and Hillsborough disaster brought the safety of football stadia into the public gaze and eventually the Taylor Report required that football clubs modernise their grounds. Meadow Lane was subsequently redeveloped during the early 1990s, although the work was planned before the report was issued. The Meadow Lane End, County Road Stand and Spion Kop were all demolished in the 1992 close season and replaced with the \"Family Stand\", the \"Jimmy Sirrel Stand\" and the \"Spion Kop Stand\" respectively. The Main Stand was replaced during the close season of 1994 by the \"Derek Pavis Stand\".\n\nIn June 2002, as part of a sponsorship deal, the ground was briefly renamed the \"Aaron Scargill Stadium\". However, the ground reverted to its original name when the deal later fell through.\n\nThe Derek Pavis Stand contains a number of conference and function facilities to complement \"The Broken Wheelbarrow\" bar behind the Family Stand. These host numerous functions throughout the year, ranging from social evenings organised by Notts County's supporter organisations, to wedding receptions and meetings of evangelical Christian churches.\n\nAway supporters are normally restricted to the Jimmy Sirrel stand, at the County Road side. This features a triangular gable (a replica of that on the old County Road stand) with the name of the club and its year of formation. Such gables are also present in the stadia of Sheffield Wednesday, Fulham, and Leyton Orient.\n\nThe Family Stand was renamed The Haydn Green Family Stand in 2007, after the man who saved Notts County from liquidation in 2003, by buying the lease on the ground and investing several million pounds. Haydn Green died suddenly in 2007 leaving an estate which still controls the lease on the ground.\n\nOutside the stadium on Meadow Lane is a bronze statue of Jimmy Sirrel and coach Jack Wheeler. Entitled \"Legends of the Lane\", the statue was sculpted by Andy Edwards and unveiled on 5 May 2016.\n\nIn 2006, it was announced that Nottingham Rugby would play a number of home games at the stadium. It was further announced in May 2006 that Notts County and Nottingham Rugby were negotiating making the agreement permanent. In October 2006 it was announced that an agreement had been reached with Notts County, allowing Nottingham Rugby to play the remainder of their 2006/07 home fixtures at Meadow Lane. In 2014 it was announced that the rugby club would move out of Meadow Lane to play at The Bay, West Bridgford.\n\nFor the 2017-18 season, the capacity set by the local authority for football is 19,841. The stadium has a total of 20,211 seats.\n\n"}

A new center-hung scoreboard was installed as well as new corner scoreboards. In addition, current bleacher seating on the north end of the arena was replaced with permanent stadium chairs. The University also received $1.8 million in private donations to upgrade the locker rooms for the men's and women's basketball teams and the volleyball team. It will be called the James and Janice Schaming Athletic Center, named after the largest donor.\n\nPrior to the building of the facility, the men's basketball team played games at various sites around the city, including Pittsburgh Civic Arena (their exclusive home from 1964 to 1988, and used for occasional big games until 2009), Fitzgerald Field House, and Duquesne Gardens, as well as several high school gymnasiums. The first men's basketball game was played in the arena on December 3, 1988, in which Duquesne defeated St. Joseph's 73-69. As of January 2008, Duquesne men's basketball had 132-125 (.514) all-time record at the Palumbo Center. The facility is used for most major sports at Duquesne, and has played host to NIT games, WNIT games, high school post season championships, national wrestling championships, and Atlantic 10 tournament competitions. During the 1994-95 basketball season, the Palumbo Center was the home of the Continental Basketball Association's Pittsburgh Piranhas. In the team's lone season in Pittsburgh, the Piranhas lost to the Yakima Sun Kings in the 1995 CBA finals. The new CONSOL Energy Center is now the home to the annual Pitt Panthers-Duquesne Dukes City Game as well as basketball games of regional interest, such as a men's game played on December 12, 2010 between the West Virginia Mountaineers and Duquesne.\n\nThe Palumbo Center is also home to the women's volleyball team and hosted the Atlantic 10 Championship in 2012, won by Temple.\n\nFor their 2017-18 season and part of the 2018-19 season, the arena will serve as the home of the Robert Morris Colonials men's basketball team for four games while the new UPMC Events Center is constructed on campus.\n\n\n"}

The matches were held on 21 November 1965 and on 24 November 1965, with North Korea winning both (6–1 and 3–1). Because all African teams had withdrawn in protest against FIFA, North Korea automatically qualified for the final tournament, where they reached the quarter-finals.\n\nAmong the facilities are Olympic-size pools for swimming and diving and an indoor volleyball court with a capacity of up to 8,000, now known as the Olympic Stadium Indoor Arena. The diving boards and swimming pools were restored in 2017 after years of disuse, and are now enjoyed daily by the general public.\n\nDuring the Khmer Rouge era, the stadium was used as an execution site where officials of the Khmer Republic formerly led by Lon Nol were killed.\n\nIn the decades following the Khmer Rouge era, the stadium facilities fell into disrepair. In 2000, the stadium complex was redeveloped by a Taiwanese firm, the Yuanta Group, which refurbished the stadium but also redeveloped parcels of the complex into condominiums and commercial properties.\n\nThe stadium has come to be a popular attraction for Phnom Penh residents, who attend daily exercise sessions, as well as football games and other activities.\n\nIn May 2007, the Irish singer Ronan Keating performed in concert in the stadium's Indoor Arena, the first concert by a major international act in Cambodia.\n\nIn November–December 2007, the World Organization Volleyball for Disabled held its world cup in the stadium's Indoor Arena, the first major international sporting event in Cambodia in more than 40 years. Cambodia, seeded fourth in the world, finished third.\n\nIn 2010, the stadium hosted all the football matches for the Cambodian Premier League, known for sponsorship purposes as the Metfone C-League.\n\nThe 2023 Southeast Asian Games will not be held at the Olympic Stadium, but at a new stadium under construction in another part of Phnom Penh, to be known as the Morodok Techo National Sports Complex.\n\n"}
{"id": "11268061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11268061", "title": "Semi-Closed Game", "text": "Semi-Closed Game\n\nA Semi-Closed Game (or Semi-Closed Opening) is a chess opening in which White plays 1.d4 but Black does not make the symmetrical reply 1...d5. (The openings starting 1.d4 d5 are the Closed Games.)\n\nBy far the most important category of the semi-closed openings are the \"Indian systems\", which begin 1.d4 Nf6.\nAs these defenses have much in common and have a great deal more theory than all the remaining semi-closed openings put together, they are treated in a separate article; see Indian defense for details.\n\nThe third most common response to 1.d4 (after 1...Nf6 and 1...d5) is 1...e6. This move is sometimes used by players wishing to play the Dutch Defense (1.d4 f5) without allowing White the option of 2.e4!?, the Staunton Gambit. 1...e6 rarely has independent significance, usually transposing to another opening, e.g. the aforementioned Dutch Defense (2.c4 f5 or 2.Nf3 f5), French Defense (2.e4 d5), or Queen's Gambit Declined (2.c4 d5). Another possibility is 2.c4 Bb4+, the Keres Defence (also known as the Kangaroo Defence), which is fully playable, but also little independent significance, since it often transposes into the Dutch, Nimzo-Indian, or Bogo-Indian.\n\nOther important responses to 1.d4 include the Dutch (1...f5) and the Benoni Defense (1...c5). The Dutch, an aggressive defense adopted for a time by World Champions Alekhine and Botvinnik, and played by both Botvinnik and challenger David Bronstein in their 1951 world championship match, is still played occasionally at the top level by Short and others. The Benoni Defense is also fairly common, and may become very wild if it develops into the Modern Benoni, though other variations are more solid.\n\n1...d6 is reasonable, and may transpose to the King's Indian Defense (e.g. after 2.Nf3 g6 3.c4 Bg7 4.Nc3 d6), Grünfeld Defence (e.g. after 2.Nf3 g6 3.c4 Bg7 4.Nc3 d5), Old Indian Defense (e.g. after 2.Nf3 Nbd7 3.c4 e5 4.Nc3 Be7), Pirc Defense (2.e4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6), or even Philidor's Defense (e.g. 2.e4 Nf6 3.Nc3 Nbd7 4.Nf3 e5). The Wade Defence, a slightly offbeat but fully playable line, arises after 1...d6 2.Nf3 Bg4. Note that the plausible 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5?! dxe5 4.Qxd8+ Kxd8 scores less than 50% for White.\n\nThe remaining semi-closed openings are uncommon. The Polish Defense has never been very popular but has been tried by Spassky, Ljubojević, and Csom, among others. The Queen's Knight Defense is an uncommon opening that often transposes to the Nimzowitsch Defence after 1.d4 Nc6 2.e4 or the Chigorin Defense after 2.c4 d5, although it can lead to unique lines, for example after 1.d4 Nc6 2.d5 or 2.c4 e5. The Englund Gambit is a rare and dubious sacrifice.\n\n\n"}

It is the largest ski resort in Central Asia. It is located in the upper part of the Medeu Valley in the Zaiilisky Alatau mountain range, at an elevation of above sea level. The resort area is about south of Almaty city by Medeo road. It is popular for its mild climate, large quantity of sunny days and great amount of snow through the winter (from November till May).\n\nShymbulak (also known as \"Chimbulak\") was disscovered by amateur skiers in the 1940s. Soon after, it became the first downhill route in the Soviet Union. Skiers originally needed to climb up the mountain tops on foot (which took roughly 3 hours). In 1954 a 1500 meters ski tow was built. Starting from 1961, Shymbulak hosted several USSR Championships and the Silver Edelweisse prize skiing competitions. In 1983 it became the Olympic ski training center for the USSR. During this time, various commodities were built including restaurants and hotels. \n\nThe annual \"Artyemenko\" Prize competition has been held in Shymbulak since 2011. The competition is held on February. Almaty hosted the 2011 Asian Winter Games, bid for 2014 Winter Olympics, considered a bid for 2018 Winter Olympics, but decided to bid for 2022 Winter Olympics instead; Shymbulak was a venue for the Alpine Skiing events (both speed and technical), and would have been for the latter.\nThe Shymbylak ski resort is located in the upper part of the Medeu Valley in the Zaiilisky Alatau mountain range, 25km from Almaty. The resort can be reach by Gondola cars from Meadeu.\n\nThe weather varies from in summer to in winter and the snow base is about .The average snowfall is around 1.5 m. The duration of the ski season is from November to April.\n\nThe ski areas span over 3000 ft of vertical drop (920m) and nearly 7.5 miles (12km) of ski runs. There are three ski lifts at the resort with the highest going to 3200 meters above sea level. There is also a Hotel located at the Resort, enabling those wishing to ski during the day, have a place to stay at night.\n\nIt is popular for its mild climate, large quantity of sunny days and great amount of snow through the winter (from November till May). \nThe resort offers a ski and snowboard school. There is also \"Shymbulak\" hotel (4 stars) and ski, snowboard and sleigh rentals.\n\nThere are three ski lifts, which cumulatively reach Talgar pass ( above the sea level), the highest point of the ski resort. The total length of the lifts is . There are 3 stations of them; the first one is \"Intersection\" Station ( above the sea level) (9 minute trip), then \"20th Prop\" Station ( above the sea level) (16.5 minutes) and \"Talgar pass\" Station ( above the sea level). There is also \"Snow-Park\" for the fans of snowboarding.\n\n\n"}

Cumberland first played at the ground the 1961 Minor Counties Championship against the Lancashire Second XI. The county played four further Minor Counties Championship matches there in the 1960s, before a single match annually there between 1971 and 1994, with the exception of 1977, when no match was played there. Cumberland played four further Minor Counties Championship matches there, the last of which saw them play Suffolk in 2000. Cumberland have played a total of 32 Minor Counties Championship at the ground to date. In 2001, the ground hosted its only List A match when Cumberland played the Warwickshire Cricket Board in the 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, which the Warwickshire Cricket Board won by 17 runs, thanks largely to Jim Troughton's 115 runs and four wickets. The following season, the ground hosted a single MCCA Knockout Trophy between Cumberland and the Yorkshire Cricket Board, however the match was abandoned without a ball bowled.\n\n\n"}
