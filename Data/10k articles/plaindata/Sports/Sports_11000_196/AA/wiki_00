{"id": "702169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=702169", "title": "Appeal (cricket)", "text": "Appeal (cricket)\n\nIn the sport of cricket, an appeal is the act of a player on the fielding team asking an umpire for a decision regarding whether a batsman is out or not. According to Law 31 of the Laws of Cricket, an umpire may not rule a batsman out unless the fielding side appeals. On many occasions when a batsman has otherwise technically been out, the fielding team neglects to appeal, so the umpire does not declare them out. An appeal may be made at any point before the bowler starts their run-up for the next ball. A bowler's appeal combined with the wicket keeper is crucial in umpire's decision.\n\nAccording to the Laws of Cricket, an appeal is a verbal query, usually in the form of, \"How's that?\" to an umpire. Since the taking of a wicket is an important event in the game, members of the fielding team often shout this phrase with great enthusiasm, and it has transmuted into the slightly abbreviated form, \"Howzat?\", often with a greatly extended final syllable. Sometimes one or other syllable is omitted entirely, the player emitting an elongated cry of simply \"How?\" or \"Zat?\". Most players also raise their arms or point at the umpire as part of the appeal. Some players have established their own trademark appeals as well.\n\nAlthough technically an appeal is required for the umpire to make a decision, in practice it is often obvious to all that a batsman is out, and the batsman may \"walk\" off the field without waiting for the decision of the umpire. This is invariably the case when a batsman is out bowled or to an obvious catch. However, the batsman is always entitled to stand their ground and wait for a decision from the umpire. In cases where they consider they might not be out, such as a catch taken low near the grass or where it is not clear whether the ball hit the bat, batsmen will not take the walking option. It is then up to the fielding team to appeal for a decision. Sometimes a batsman will walk even when it is not clear to others that they are out, if in their own mind they are certain they were out; this is considered to be the epitome of sportsmanship.\n\nSome decisions, such as leg before wicket, always require an appeal and the umpire's decision, as no batsman will preempt the umpire on what requires fine judgment of several factors. Run-outs and stumpings are usually appealed and decided by an umpire, unless the batsman is clearly out of their ground and obviously out. Appealing differs vastly from sledging in the context that appealing is not supposed to be offensive or directly taunting to the other team, and more of a celebration to the appealing team. However, excessive appealing is against ICC's Code of Conduct.\n\nUnder the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct, it is considered unsportsmanlike to:\nAny instances of such behaviour are punishable by fines or match bans, as adjudicated and imposed by the match referee.\n\n"}

It is run at Ayr over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.\n\nThe event was established in 1804, and it was originally held at Ayr's former racecourse at Belleisle. In the early part of its history it was restricted to horses bred and trained in Scotland. It was initially contested over two separate heats of two miles, and was subsequently a single race with a two-mile distance.\n\nThe Ayr Gold Cup became a handicap in 1855, and it was shortened to about a mile in 1870. The Belleisle track closed in 1907, and the race was relocated and cut to 6 furlongs in 1908.\n\nThe lightest winning weight in the race since it became a sprint is 6 st 13 lb (44 kg). This was carried to victory by Marmaduke Jinks in 1936. The heaviest is 10 st (63½ kg), the burden of Roman Warrior in 1975.

{"id": "2796593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2796593", "title": "Borchert Field", "text": "Borchert Field\n\nBorchert Field was a baseball park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. The home field for several professional baseball clubs from 1888 through 1952, it became obsolete after the construction of County Stadium in 1953 and was demolished later that year. The site is now covered by Interstate 43.\n\nThe park was built on a rectangular block bounded by North 7th, 8th, Chambers, and Burleigh Streets. Home plate was at the south end (Chambers), with the outfield bounded by the outer fence, making fair territory home-plate-shaped, with short fields in left and right and very deep power alleys, a configuration used by a number of ballparks of the era that were constrained by a narrow block.\n\nThe playing field's approximate elevation was above sea level.\n\nOriginally known as Athletic Park, the park opened for baseball in May, 1888. During winter, it was flooded and served as an ice hockey rink. The ballfield replaced the Wright Street Grounds. (Podoll, p. 46)\n\nThe ballpark operated as the home of the Milwaukee Creams of the Western League, later renamed the Brewers. The Creams/Brewers played there through the 1894 season.\n\nThe ballfield was also sublet to the Milwaukee Brewers club of the major league American Association for the latter part of the 1891 season, replacing the disbanded Cincinnati Kelly's Killers. After the major league American Association merged into the National League in 1892, the Milwaukee franchise was discontinued.\n\nAn independent minor league named the American Association formed in 1902, including a new Milwaukee Brewers club. Meanwhile, another new minor league club, the Creams, began play in a new version of the Western League. The Creams retained the lease on the Lloyd Street property, so the Brewers re-opened their ballpark, initially calling it Brewer Field, although the name Athletic Park endured until around 1920. After the purchase of the Brewers by Milwaukee capitalist Otto Borchert, the club became known as Borchert Field. Its original seating capacity was 4,800 (Pajot; 2009), but was later expanded to 10,000.\n\nBecause Milwaukee was too small to support two ballclubs, the Western League entry folded after 1903. The AA Brewers played for 51 seasons before being displaced by the major league Milwaukee Braves.\n\nAthletic Park / Brewer Field was officially renamed Borchert Field at the start of the 1928 season in honor of previous owner Otto Borchert, who had died the previous year at a baseball dinner that was being broadcast live on the radio (Podoll, p. 218). During the 1920s, the ballpark had been unofficially dubbed \"Borchert's Orchard\" by the media (Podoll, p. 189).\n\nBorchert Field was also home to the Milwaukee Bears, an entry in the Negro Leagues, and the Milwaukee Chicks of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The Chicks won a pennant in their only year of operation.\n\nOne of the more colorful times for the stadium occurred during the early 1940s when Bill Veeck owned the team. The \"PT Barnum of Baseball\" brought an element of whimsy and marketing to the park, including fan giveaways of livestock, butter and vegetables, and staging morning games for third-shift wartime workers. According to his own autobiography, \"Veeck – As in Wreck\", he claimed to have installed a screen to make the right field target a little more difficult for left-handed pull hitters of the opposing team. The screen was on wheels, so any given day it might be in place or not, depending on the batting strength of the opposing team.\n\nThere was no rule against that activity as such, so he got away with it, until one day when he took it to an extreme, rolling it out when the opponents batted, and reeling it back when the Brewers batted. Veeck reported that the league passed a rule against it the very next day. It has been speculated that the story was made up by Veeck; research by two members of the Society for American Baseball Research revealed no evidence of either a movable fence or any gear (pulleys, etc.) required for it to work.\n\nIn that same book Veeck wrote: \"Borchert Field, an architectural monstrosity, was so constructed that the fans on the first-base side of the grandstand couldn't see the right fielder, which seemed perfectly fair in that the fans on the third-base side couldn't see the left fielder. 'Listen,' I told them. 'This way you'll have to come back twice to see the whole team.'\" Veeck's comments referred to the exceptionally high corners, which could theoretically hide the closest outfielder from a given spectator's view at times.\n\nThe Milwaukee Badgers, who played in the National Football League from 1922 to 1926, staged their home games at Borchert Field.\n\nBorchert Field was also the host to the first Green Bay Packers game held in Milwaukee, a 10–7 loss to the New York Giants on October 1, 1933. The Packers played games in Milwaukee at County Stadium starting in 1953 through 1994.\n\nBorchert Field was too small to accommodate Major League Baseball. Milwaukee's city fathers, looking to attract a major league franchise, built County Stadium to replace Borchert Field. It was intended that the Brewers would play in County Stadium in the 1953 season, but early that year their parent club, the Boston Braves, relocated to Milwaukee, so the final season of baseball at Borchert Field also turned out to be the last season of Brewers minor league baseball. The minor league franchise remained the Braves' top affiliate, moving to Toledo, where it was the next incarnation of the Mud Hens for three seasons, through 1955.\n\nFirst slated to become a recreation area, the former site of the stadium (and the entire block) is now fully occupied by Interstate 43, Milwaukee's major north-south freeway, just north of exit 74 (Locust Street).\n\n\n\n"}

Advanced systems may utilize a dedicated room, hitting screen, projector and other paraphernalia.\n\nSimpler simulators typically do not possess built-in software, but measure the movement of the hand-held sensor and feeds the information to the video game. The information received is then translated into an action of some sort, usually hitting the ball. More advanced simulators often come with their own software, allowing the user to use the system as if they were on a driving range. Relying on a battery of environmental sensors, the software tracks each shot and represents the entire shot, from impact to how the ball bounces visually on screen. In this way, the golfer has a detailed analysis of the entire flight of the ball which can be used for practice or training.\n\nIt utilizes a projected landscape, sometimes with natural images. A computer calculates the expected trajectory of the golf ball from data gathered on the swing, and the image of the golf ball flight is then simulated on the screen via a projector. Golf simulators need to present club speed, club path, club face angle at impact, ball speed, ball path, horizontal and vertical launch angle and spin. There are several types of measurement system used in golf simulation to achieve this, such as simulator mats, sonic sound systems, optical sensor arrays, radar and camera ball tracking systems.\n\nMany golf simulator systems use a sensor mat, which is essentially a rectangular mat containing several infrared sensors and microchips that can monitor the speed of the club as it passes the back sensor, the angle of the club and club speed as the ball and club pass the second sensor following impact and the direction of the ball as the club passes the third sensor. Such systems are used by GolfBlaster3D, ProTee United, Dancin' Dogg by Optishot, TruGolf and Unex Golf.\n\nA sonic system uses strategically placed microphones around the impact screen. The system measures and compares the intensity of sound that is produced by the ball hitting the screen. Using 3 or more directional microphones and an interface that can measure the sound amplitude of the impact from each microphone, an XY impact position can be determined. This type of measurement system is rarely used in modern simulators.\n\nA radar sits aside the player to gather launch data. They emmit a microwave that reflects off any moving object which returns to the sensor. The system can then record trajectory, launch angle, speed and direction. Additional physics is applied to these figures to calculate spin, axis and tilt. These types of system can be used indoors or outdoors. They are very useful as launch monitors, and they work very effectively. Several professionals make use of them to analyse their game in real environments. Typical examples are available from TrackMan and Flightscope.\n\nThis method uses two banks of Infra Red sensors that scan across the bay in both X and Y directions. The ball passes through the first set of sensors and its XY coordinate is captured. The ball then passes another set of sensors and the second XY coordinates are captured again. The two co-ordinates are then compared to determine the vertical launch angle, ball path and speed. The system is very accurate very expensive to construct as you need hundreds of optical sensors and emitters to catch the coordinates of the ball in both sensor positions. The main disadvantage is that the ball must always pass through both sensors with a fast shot so that there is no downward curve in the ball's trajectory before hitting the screen.That means that chipping and putting will not work too well.\n\nCameras are becoming the norm in golf simulation. In general, one, two, three or four cameras are used that continuously monitor the play area. The downward swing path, impact, club face angle, launch angle and ball speed are all captured by the high speed cameras, normally running at around 100 to 120 frames per second. Camera data is processed using complex physics algorithms to produce a multitude of data such as back spin, side spin, trajectory, club face angle, swing path, loft, distance, carry and roll. \nThe, most common types of camera measurement system are Triggered and Continuous. With triggered systems, Images are taken only after the club has passed through a trigger point to activate the camera. With continuous systems, the camera records permanently, and data is processed once impact with the ball is observed. Continuous cameras must be capable of frame rates in excess of 100 frames per second per camera. Such systems are used by Bogolf, Visual Sports, Sports Coach Systems and Full Swing Golf. For both methods, one camera is floor mounted facing the ball trajectory from the side, the other is over head mounted and facing down. ProTee United is using a high speed sensor system to read club head information, special floor sensors for putting and two high speed cameras (one on the floor and one on the ceiling) to pick up ball flight information. An alternative method of measuring these two angles is to mount both cameras in the upper left and right corners of the bay. This is known as stereoscopic image processing.\n\nThe typical dimensions of a golf simulator are approximately wide × in length and just over in height. This allows freedom of movement whilst swinging. This space typically allows for both left- and right-handed players with backswings and follow throughs.\n\nThe principal advantage of a golf simulator is the ability to conveniently play and practice in a controlled ambience. Often this means the ability to play without any pressure, green fees, or tee times; however, the advent of \"indoor golf centers\", which provide simulators for commercial play, bring many of these competitive and social aspects into the simulated game. For those who live in wintry climes or urban settings, golf simulators offer the ability to play and practice year-round or within the confines of their locale. The space requirements can range from just needing an ceiling to an entire wall upon which the game's screen is attached. The next important advantage is the player's ability to see each facet of their swing. Many golf simulators measure: angle of attack, angle of the club face, club head speed, spin, club path (inside out or outside in), and more. These measurements help both students and teaching professionals identify exactly what a player needs to know to improve their swing.\n\nThere are a number of different technologies in use presently. Principally they either track ball flight or club head motion. Ball flight is typically tracked via wavelength (infrared), audio, and/or laser sensors. These instruments serve as a means by which the ball's flight properties are tracked, namely launch angle, ball speed and ball direction. Club motion is similarly tracked via wavelength sensors or other devices such tethers, cameras, or lasers, which record the speed and direction of the club's head as well as the impact point of the ball on the club's striking surface. In some cases, based on the location of the sensing devices, it is now possible to capture data on both ball and club for most accurate speed and directional information, and simulated ball flight behavior.\n\nThe data collected is extrapolated to provide ball flight trajectory and roll out according to certain calculated relationships to the ball's flight performance per the tracked motion of the ball or club, adding environmental aspects through which the ball is projected, including terrain, wind, rain and other such influences or obstacles.\n\nThe way that the information is tracked varies as much as having a wall-sized screen recording ball speed and placement upon impact, to sensors that record the moments before, during and after the impact between the ball and club, in which case, the ball is held by a tether.\n\nA key attribute of any simulator is accuracy. Ball flight is the primary determinant of a system's accuracy. Speed of the calculations and a predictable projected image of the ball in flight is one measurement of a system's accuracy. Predictability or the plausibility of prediction is a measure according to known ball flight properties among golf experts.\n\nA ball's flight depends upon many things, including the ball itself, the strike and impact of the club upon the ball, the ball's launch angle, direction, spin rate and velocity, as well as the hitting surface from which the ball is struck and the simulated environment through which the ball virtually flies, suggesting wind, rain, and other environmental aspects that may affect ball flight. The battle for superiority in this market exists between the technologies utilized to track ball flight or club motion.\n\nAn indoor driving range can be a low-ceiling structure in which players hit golfballs into a net at close range, or a large high-ceiling dome, where players are better able to observe the trajectory of the golfball in flight. Because of the nature of being indoors, these structures provide players with the opportunity to practice regardless of the outside conditions. Teaching professionals and computer/video evaluation tools may also be available at these ranges, as well as specialized areas for putting, chipping, and sand shots.\n\nIndoor golf can be found in different areas. Everywhere where there is enough space in order to swing the club, a training area or a golf simulator to be installed.\n\nCommercial Applications:\nCountry clubs, hotels & resorts, offices, fitness facilities and sports bars are among the many commercial uses of golf simulators. These serve both as entertainment for guests and practice for golfers. An indoor golf center consists of several simulators and a golf practice area, often including indoor driving range, chipping area, putting green, or any combination.\n\nResidential Applications:\nIndoor golf simulators have been gaining popularity in residential applications during recent years. As technology advances bring costs down, many avid golfers have chosen to equip their homes with indoor golf training facilities.\n\nIndoor golf greens have recently enjoyed a drastic increase in overall quality and play-ability while also enjoying significant reduction in cost.\n"}

It is owned by the ARC Racing and Leisure Group, formerly Arena Leisure Plc.\n\nLingfield is best known as a winter all-weather flat-racing course; the track is Polytrack, rather than the usual turf found in the UK. There are only five other all-weather courses in the UK, the others being at Southwell, Kempton, Wolverhampton, Newcastle, and Chelmsford City (formerly Great Leighs Racecourse). Lingfield stages flat racing on turf in the summer and National Hunt races are also run on turf. Owned by a fellow called Martin Pollard.\n\nLingfield Railway Station adjoins the course, served by trains from London to East Grinstead via Oxted.\n\nThe racecourse is located in a estate and was opened in 1890 by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), who also agreed to let Lingfield incorporate the Prince of Wales feathers into its official heading. The course initially held jumps racing only, but in 1894 the Jockey Club granted permission for flat racing to be held. Racing has been held continuously ever since, with the only exception being during World War II when the War Office requisitioned the course. Ladbrokes sold the course in 1982 and the new owners installed flood defences on the estate to alleviate the flooding that had become a major problem in the years immediately after the war. A golf course was developed and this opened in June 1987. Arena Leisure purchased the course in 1991, and in 2001 made the decision to replace the Equitrack all-weather surface with Polytrack, opening in November 2001. Other recent developments have been the re-laying of the back straight on the turf course in 2002/2003 and the construction of a £5.5 million grandstand in 2004. In early 2009 the course had another record broken as Matsunosuke became the highest rated horse to win on the all-weather surface rated 112 or 117 by Racing Post rating. This was dubbed as the greatest all-weather horse of all time in the UK.\n\nIn addition, there's now a Marriott hotel based on the racecourse.\n\nThe racecourse is featured in the 1954 film \"The Rainbow Jacket\".\n\n\n"}

These Laws are the agreed upon and maintained by the Rugby League International Federation. The playing field is defined as \"the area bounded by, but not including, the touch lines and dead ball lines\" by Section 2. If the ball or any player in possession of it makes contact with the touch lines or dead ball lines or the ground beyond them it is deemed to be out of play.\n\nThe rugby league field also has markings to denote where restarts, such as scrums, should be placed.\n\nRugby league is played on a field 112–122 by 68 metres (122.5–133.4 × 74.3 yards). The longer boundary lines are \"touch lines\", while the shorter boundary lines are \"dead ball lines\". The touch lines and dead ball lines are out of play.\n\nNear each end of the field is a \"goal line\", or try-line; they are 100 metres (109.4 yards) apart. A scoring area called the \"in-goal area\" extends 6–11 metres (6.6–12 yards) from each try-line to each dead ball line.\n\nMost play will occur within the \"field of play\", this \"is the area bounded by, but not including, the touch lines and goal lines\".\n\nWhen the team in possession of the ball is attempting to score a try, the goal line is included in the in-goal area, grounding the ball correctly on either is a try.\n\nWhen the team in possession is attempting to return the ball to the field of play from their own in-goal area the goal line is part of the field of play. A team caught with the ball in their own in-goal must restart play with a drop kick of the ball from between their posts, this usually results in the other team gaining possession.\n\nBetween the goal lines, broken lines run parallel to each touch line at 10 and 20 metres from touch. Free kicks are taken 10 metres in from the point where the ball entered touch after being kicked out to gain ground from a penalty. If a scrum is required to restart play and the event that caused it occurred \"within 20 metres of a touch line or ten metres of a goal line the scrum shall be brought in twenty metres from the touch line and ten metres from the goal line\".\n\nLines with distance markers transverse the field every 10 metres perpendicular to the touch lines. The distances ascend from each goal line towards the halfway line, which is marked \"50\" (similar to a typical American football field). These lines, as well as the goal lines, dead ball lines and touch lines are 15 centimetres wide and white in colour, the only exception being the 40-metre lines, which are usually coloured red to distinguish them for the determination of 40–20 kicks in play.\n\nThe broken lines 10 metres and 20 metres in from the touch lines are 10 centimetres wide and white in colour.\n\nThe distance markers on the playing field are white with a red outline. These numbers are 2 metres high.\n\nOn each goal line are two goal posts 5.5 metres apart connected by a cross bar 3 metres from the ground. Each goal post is 16 metres in height (however they can be built higher) and for the purpose of judging a goal are considered to extend upwards indefinitely. The posts and crossbar form an \"H\" shape. Goal posts supported by only one post below the crossbar are permissible. The bottom two metres of a goal post is recommended to be padded to protect players from injury. At professional level, these pads are usually cuboids that encase each post.\n\nA corner post is placed at the points where each touch line meets each goal line. The post must consist of non-rigid material and should be at least 1.25 metres in height. The corner posts are \"in touch in-goal\", that is to say they act in the same way as sidelines and the ball-carrier touching them immediately halts play.\n\nDuring the 2010 NRL season, a rule change to the playing field was implemented so that if a player in possession of the ball made contact with the corner post that player would no longer be considered to be touch in-goal. Proponents of the move argued a series a possible future scenarios made this preventative measure necessary, with ARL chief executive Geoff Carr stating, \"no one has thought of the possibility of using the corner post as a weapon to defuse a try and we want to stop it before they do\". One scenario was that a defending player might manipulate the corner post to put an attacker out of play. Another concern cited was that the corner post might be made to make contact with a rolling ball to ensure the defending team gains possession with a 20-metre restart. Corner posts, which sometimes lean to one side, have no upper height limit set and this led to a fear that corner posts might become \"long rubber snakes, biting attackers and sending them into touch\", in the words of Roy Masters. Other laws concerning the corner posts remained unchanged. A ball that makes contact with the corner post while not in the possession of a player will be deemed to be touch in-goal as before. There was no attempt to remove the corner posts from the playing field as they are used to promote sponsors and are also a useful aid for players to judge their kicks. The change was agreed by the NRL Board and approved by the RLIF as an experimental rule. Implementation occurred mid-season following feedback from clubs.\n\n\n\n"}

Initially started to equip little league and school athletic teams, the company's business greatly increased in the 1970s and 1980s. Nine stores in the Georgia cities of Albany, Columbus, and LaGrange and the Alabama cities of Phenix City and Auburn allowed The Game to become one of the most important sports apparel companies in the Southeastern United States.\n\nThe business grew rapidly during the 1970s and early 80’s until Neil had built a small chain of 9 sporting good stores covering Phenix City, AL; Auburn, AL; Columbus, GA; Albany, GA; and LaGrange, GA. The business grew steadily until he had become one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the southeast.\n\nNeil’s Sport Shops grew into multiple divisions, which included a retail segment, team sales, concessions and military. By expanding his business into multiple lines, Neil began to see the growth potential that the sporting goods market had to offer. By 1984, the business had grown significantly and Neil began searching for something opportunities to expand. He sold his company to the W.C. Bradley Company in Columbus, GA and stayed on as an officer. The separate divisions of Neil’s Sport Shops were eventually sold to other buyers. One of the buyers was Neil’s older brother Bill who bought the concession business and managed the concession sales for the majority of the Southeastern Conference Schools. Neil saw the growth that was happening in the concession sales as well as the retail side of the sporting goods business. He had been overseas and seen the opportunity to import products for his stores and soon decided to import sporting goods apparel on his own to sell to the different colleges.\n\nIn 1986, Neil formed The Game and the W.C. Bradley Company agreed to stay involved as a financial partner. The primary focus of The Game was to provide headwear designs for Colleges across the country. This would include everything from the initial design of the caps to the sales force that would call on the individual schools. Neil’s younger brother Phil was an independent salesman for Nike at this time and also agreed to represent The Game. Soon afterwards, Phil helped develop a national sales force for The Game through his contacts with other salesmen throughout the country. Within a matter of months, The Game had its first product designs and a national sales force in place to sell it. All of this happened at a time when the demand for college apparel was about to skyrocket.\n\nThe combination of logo designs and headwear was an instant success in the college markets. Designs such as “The Bar“ helped propel the growth of the company not only in the Southeast, but also throughout the country. Students and fans of colleges began to recognize the red, white and blue “G” logo on the back of their caps and started seeking out these products on a regular basis.\n\nA natural progression for The Game was their move from a college only program into the professional sports programs such as Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association. The addition of these properties also propelled the growth of The Game during a time in which college and professional sports saw phenomenal growth. Soon, The Game could be found not only in college bookstores, but also in major league sporting event venues and in major retailers all across the country.\n\nThe Game also moved into expanding their apparel line by offering complementary products to the headwear such as sweatshirts, sweatpants, shorts, shirts, etc. All of this growth occurred during the period of 1987 to 1991, which saw The Game go from $0 sales in 1986 and a small warehouse to annual sales of over $80 million and a manufacturing facility.\n\nWhen Neil originally started The Game in 1986 and brought in the W.C. Bradley Company as his partner, he had a 5-year agreement with them as President of the company. When it came time for him to renew his contract in 1992, he opted to not renew the contract and “slow down” for a while. At this point, The Game was managed by the W.C. Bradley Company and was eventually sold to Russell Athletic in 1993.\n\nAs Neil began winding down his responsibilities at The Game, friend and founder of Realtree Outdoor Products, Bill Jordan introduced Neil to Tommy Allison who was the cousin and business manager for NASCAR driver Davey Allison. Davey and Tommy were looking for someone to help them with upgrading their licensed merchandise, which was primarily sold at NASCAR races. Over the next few months, Neil, Tommy, Davey and Bill talked and discussed the many opportunities available within NASCAR. By January 1993, Neil had decided retirement was not for him and formed A-Star promotions. The primary purpose of A-Star was to design, manage and sell all of the merchandise for the Davey Allison / Texaco Havoline racing team. This included everything from apparel to bumper stickers and miscellaneous souvenirs. The combination of Neil’s experience in importing merchandise, Davey’s success and fan following in NASCAR and the business management of Tommy Allison and Bill Jordan proved to be an instant success. When Davey’s merchandise began to show up at the races, other drivers and teams wanted to know where they could also get merchandise. The idea to form a separate company was born.\n\nAs business began booming for A-Star, Davey Allison was killed in a helicopter accident at Talladega Superspeedway. Although this ended what began as a strong start for A-Star, it was also the catalyst for forming Kudzu which became the company that began designing, importing and selling headwear and jackets to NASCAR teams just as The Game had done for college and professional sports. For the formation of Kudzu, Neil teamed with Tommy Allison, Neil’s brother Phil and Neil’s son Jeff.\n\nFrom 1993 through 1998 several key events occurred. First, the W.C. Bradley Company sold The Game to Russell Athletic. This was a period marked by baseball strikes, reorganization of the NFL and many new headwear companies focusing on gaining market share in the college arena. Second, NASCAR experienced its greatest growth years with the addition of new racetracks, drivers becoming household names and most races being covered on national television networks. Kudzu’s business also grew exponentially as the company penetrated the majority of all of the leading NASCAR Winston Cup drivers and teams with their products. This also opened up the ability to work with major corporate sponsors on their apparel programs as well.\n\nNeil still longed to be back in the college market with The Game and his original sales force. He would not have to wait long. In 1998, Neil was contacted by Russell Athletic wanting to know if he would be interested in purchasing The Game. By October 1998, a deal was completed and The Game was back with its original owners once again. Since then, Neil, Tommy, Phil, Jeff and the W.C. Bradley Company have been restoring the brand to the prominence it once enjoyed in the college markets. Today, many of the same representatives that began selling The Game products in 1986 are still selling them today.\n\nIn 2008, the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball signed a contract to outfit all eight of its teams with game and batting practice caps produced by The Game. These caps feature The Game's logo in team-specific colors.\n\n"}
{"id": "11071816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11071816", "title": "The Winning Team", "text": "The Winning Team\n\nThe Winning Team is a 1952 biographical film directed by Lewis Seiler. It is a fictionalized biography of the life of major league pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander (1887–1950) starring Ronald Reagan as Alexander, Doris Day as his wife, Aimee, and Frank Lovejoy as baseball star Rogers Hornsby.\n\nIt includes his heroic performance in three games in the 1926 World Series against the New York Yankees, where the 7th inning strikeout of Tony Lazzeri is used as the game-ending, Series-winning pitch.\n\nThe film earned an estimated $1.7 million at the North American box office in 1952.\n\nThis movie starts with \"Alex\" (Ronald Reagan) in his birth home on his parent's farm in Elba, Nebraska. While standing and speaking with his father a man comes up to them and lets them know that there is an exhibition baseball game between the local farmers and those of a minor league baseball team. Grover Cleveland Alexander \"Alex\" runs to where that game is taking place.<br>\n\nThe scene switches to where his fiancé Aimee (Doris Day) is talking with her father. Her father does not have a very good opinion of Alex because he is more interested in baseball than in farming. He is worried for his daughter's future.\nThe game between the farmers and the team is a betting place. Many come to see this game and they know that with Alex pitching they can't lose. As we watch this game Alex strikes out everyone. When he wins the game he returns home.<br>\n\nDoris is at home waiting for Alex. Aimee's father offers to put a down payment on a farm for his daughter. After a small argument Doris switches to her father's side and promises that Alex will not play baseball.<br>\n\nNow we go forward to a Church meeting where an invited guest was to show film shots of his recent journey to Norway. As he begins his presentation the first film is upside down and way out of focus. He begins to speak about that film once it has been fixed to the screen when a noise is heard. It is the sound of a back-firing automobile. Our peek to outside shows this car drive up to the front door of the chapel. the driver gets out and opens the door which causes the light from outside to blur out the picture on the screen. Then the driver announces that he is looking for Alex. After walking from the back of the chapel to the front and announces his search, he finally sees Alex and asks him to come outside with him. While they are standing outside the driver asks Alex if he can really pitch like he did at the earlier game whenever or was it a fluke.<br>\n\nThe next thing we see is Alex pitching to this driver who we now know is the manager of the team he beat. Aimee is shown inside and listening to the presentation which is now interrupted by the sound of a ball hitting a glove over and over again. Alex is offered fifty dollars a month if he will consider playing for his team. Alex agrees to play and is shown playing baseball with the new team, the Galesburg Boosters. He sent a baseball card with his picture along with money on a regular basis so he could buy the farm for him and his fiancé.<br>\n\nDuring one of the games Alex got on base after being walked. He was warned not to slide as he ran the bases by his coach. the next pitch to the next batter was hit and Alex ran to second base. While he ran the second baseman caught the ball to get Alex out and then threw the ball to first base where it hit Alex right in the head. He woke up three days later in the hospital surrounded by Aimee and his mother. That ended his 1909 season of baseball.<br>\n\nDuring the off season between 1909 and 1910 he now has enough money to buy that farm and to marry Aimee. There is a funny part between a car and a wagon here. After arriving at the farm he goes out back while his wife is changing and starts chucking mud balls at a fence. His eyes are out of whack and he sees everything in double. He hires a catcher to catch for him and he is always just a bit off because of his eyesight.<br>\n\nIn 1910 he returns to baseball after he wakes up one morning and his eyes are perfect again. His record during that year was 29-11 as he now played for the Syracuse Stars in the class B New York State League. Then he is sold to the Philadelphia Phillies for 750 dollars.<br>\n\nWe now turn to what Doris Day is known for. The scene is a Christmas at the farm where the family is gathered around and Aimee sings. Now we return to the regularly scheduled movie of baseball.<br>\n\nThe first game with the Phillies is the 1911 City Series. He throws five innings of perfect no hit, no run baseball. His official Major League baseball debut is on April 15th of that year. During one game he is facing Rogers Hornsby. The catcher passes on a tidbit of info that if Hornsby strikes out he will be booted off the team. Alex tells the catcher what the next pitches will be and Hornsby is able to connect with one of them.<br>\n\nIn 1918 Alex spent most of that year in France as a Sergeant with a Field Artillery unit where he was exposed to mustard gas and a shell that exploded near him caused partial hearing loss. As a result of the shell he developed epileptic seizures. This didn't help matters because he also suffered from a drinking problem. He was now back in the states and was still pitching in 1919.<br>\nHe was traded from Philadelphia to Chicago and pitched for the Cubs during the 1920 season where he won the triple crown while pitching. While playing a Game at Forbes Field his hearing problem returns. In the sixth inning while on the mound, Alex falls down and his teammates carry him off the field. It turns out to be an epileptic seizure.<br>\n\nThe next scene shows Alex in his doctor's office. He has just been told that if he wants to live he should probably go back to that farm life he grew up with. Alex is not hearing of that. He tells the doctor that he really doesn't want his wife Aimee to know. <br>\n\nAs Alex is walking down the street, he is in front of a speak-easy and, after letting a couple of people in, the doorman recognizing Alex and invites him in for a drink, \"On the house.\" He is shown totally inebriated. As he lays his head down into his arm a customer is seen walking to a telephone booth. He asks for the sports desk. When the person on the other end answers the person tells the other end that he knows why Alex fell at the ballgame today. It is because, \"He's a Lush.\" The papers are filled with stories of the drinking problems of Alex.\nWe are now taken to a baseball game where Alex fields a ball and basically throws it away to the first basemen. He is removed from the game.<br>\n\nAlex is next shown where drinking seems to be his new pastime. We see him as he stumbles down an alley and then falls as he reaches the end. he is removed from the cubs and sent to a team called the \"House of David.\" All this time his wife is trying to find him because she lost track of where he was.<br>\n\nAimee is finally told where \"Alexander the Great\" is. He is now on a main show liner at a circus. He is touted as the man who can answer all your questions about baseball--and specifically about pitching. Aimee buys a ticket, but when he comes out from the rear of the tent she hides. He spews out many facts and figures about his own career and then asks if anyone has any questions. Aimee leaves without contacting him.<br>\n\nWhen Aimee does get in touch with him she tells him that she knows of his medical conditions. He is contacted by his old friend Roger Hornsby, at the bequest of Aimee, and is offered a pitching job with the St. Louis, Cardinals.<br>\n\nWe are now taken to the World Series of 1926 when the St. Louis, Cardinals and the New York, Yankees are squaring off. Alex pitches the second and the sixth games of the series and they win both of them. At the conclusion of the sixth game Alex and Aimee have a conversation in the tunnel of the stadium. It is here when she learns that he looks to her and gets his strength while pitching during this season. He also tells her that she looks tired because he has relied on her so much.<br>\n\nThe Cardinals tie up the series at 3-3. It is now the seventh game. Aimee is not at the stadium because she is packing their stuff for a vacation that will start as soon as the game is over. Alex is not expected to pitch today at all. It is a close game. They are at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis and in the seventh inning the pitcher of record has allowed the bases to be loaded. Roger Hornsby, player/manager comes in and pulls the pitcher. He somehow gets a message to the bullpen for Alex to come out and pitch them out of the mess. When Alex gets to the mound he looks and finds that Aimee is not there. Aimee is at the street ready to call for a taxi when she reads on the ticker-tape board across the street that her husband has now been called on to pitch. She has the bell hop at the street to get her a taxi right away so she can get to the stadium.<br>\n\nWhile she is in traffic Alex is pitching to this batter without her as his rock. He pitches out of the inning and Aimee arrives at the stadium before the ninth inning. She sits in her chair and he sees her. The Cardinals win the series!<br>\n\nIn the final baseball scene, Alexander is shown striking out a Yankee batter to end the 1926 World Series. The actual final out of the 1926 World Series came when Babe Ruth was caught trying to steal second base.\n\n\n\n"}
