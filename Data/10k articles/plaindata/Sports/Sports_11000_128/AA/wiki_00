Bassett, son of former Toronto Maple Leafs part owner John Bassett. The new owner renamed team the Toros, as its short for Toronto, and it is also a Spanish bull. To attract attention, Bassett signed 18-year-old Toronto Marlboros star Wayne Dillon, and former Maple Leafs defenseman Carl Brewer to anchor the blueline. The Toros also thought they had a deal to sign Maple Leafs star player Darryl Sittler to a five-year, $1 million contract, however, Sittler decided to return to the Leafs.\n\nThe Toros originally planned to move the team into a renovated CNE Coliseum, while Bill Ballard, the son of Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard and was running Maple Leaf Gardens due to his father being in prison, was opposed of the renovation and wanted the team to play in the Gardens. The Toros decided to spend the season at Varsity Arena, which seated 4,860 fans.\n\nAs the Ottawa Nationals the previous season, the team finished in fourth place in the Eastern Division with a 35-39-4 record, losing to the New England Whalers in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThe first game for the Toros was played on October 7, 1973, at Varsity Arena, with Toronto tying the Chicago Cougars 4-4. The Toros would get off to a sluggish start, going 0-2-2 in their first four games before defeating the Los Angeles Sharks 3-0 on the road. The team continued to slump, and through their first twelve games, sat with a record of 2-7-3. Toronto would break out of their slump though, and post a record of 17-11-0 in their next 28 games to go over the .500 for the first time. The Toros would keep up their great play, and end the season in second place in the Eastern Division, with a 41-33-4 record, earning 86 points, which was a twelve-point improvement over the previous season. Head coach Billy Harris won the Howard Baldwin Trophy, presented to the Coach of the Year.\n\nOffensively, Toronto was led by Wayne Carleton, who finished with a team high 37 goals and 92 points and finished sixth in league scoring. Gavin Kirk had another solid season, earning 68 points in 78 games, while rookie Wayne Dillon earned 65 points in 71 games. The defense was led by Brian Gibbons, who had 35 points, while Carl Brewer chipped in with 25 points. Rick Cunningham led the Toros with 88 penalty minutes.\n\nIn goal, Gilles Gratton had the majority of playing time, winning 26 games while posting a GAA of 3.53, along with two shutouts. Les Binkley backed him up, winning 14 games with a team best 3.27 GAA, and a shutout.\n\nThe Toros opened the playoffs in a best of seven series against the Cleveland Crusaders, who finished in third place in the Eastern Division, three points behind Toronto. The series opened at Varsity Arena, with the Toros shutting out the Crusaders 4-0 in the series opener, followed by a close 4-3 victory in the second game to take a 2-0 series lead. The series shifted to Cleveland for the next two games, however, the Toros took the third game 4-2 to put the Crusaders on the brink of elimination. Cleveland managed to avoid being eliminated in the fourth game, winning 3-2 in overtime, however, the series returned to Toronto for the fifth game, with the Toros winning 4-1 to take the series in five games.\n\nNext up for Toronto was the Chicago Cougars, who finished in fourth place in the Eastern Division, five points behind the Toros. The Cougars defeated the first place New England Whalers in seven games to advance to the Divisional Finals. The series opened in Toronto, and the Toros took an early series lead with a 6-4 victory in the first game. The Cougars would win the second game 4-3 to even the series up. The series moved to Chicago for the next two games, and the Cougars took a 2-1 series lead with a 3-2 victory in the third game, however, the Toros won a wild fourth game by a 7-6 score to even the series up again. In the fifth game in Toronto, the Toros took care of the Cougars 5-3 to go up 3-2 in the series. Back in Chicago for the sixth game, the Cougars fought off elimination, easily defeating Toronto by a 9-2 score, setting up a seventh and final game at Varsity Arena. Chicago would upset the favoured Toros, winning the game 5-2 to advance to the Avco Cup finals, ending Toronto's season.\n\nToronto's draft picks at the 1973 WHA Amateur Draft.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42138530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42138530", "title": "Bandy field", "text": "Bandy field\n\nA bandy field or bandy rink is an ice rink used for playing bandy.\n\nOriginally, bandy was played on naturally frozen ice, mainly on lakes. Teams often had to take time to go out and search for the best ice to use. Soon, ice started to be created on soccer pitches in the wintertime, allowing for a more safe place to play. This may be the reason the outer measurements are the same as for a soccer field. The first artificially frozen bandy field was created in Budapest, Hungary, in 1923. In the 1980s, indoor arenas started to be built, allowing for a longer season. The world's first indoor bandy arena, the Olimpiyskiy, was built in Moscow for the 1980 Summer Olympics but has hosted many bandy events since.\n\nThe size of a bandy field is regulated in section 1.1 of the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the Federation of International Bandy It shall be rectangular and in the range ( by ), about the same size as a football pitch for association football and considerably larger than an ice hockey rink. For international play, the field must not be smaller than times . The field is outlined with distinct and unbroken lines according to section 1.1. These lines are red and between wide, according to section 1.1 D.\nAlong the sidelines, section 1.2 of the Rules prescribes the use of a high border (board, vant, sarg, wand, wall) to be placed to prevent the ball from leaving the ice. It should not be attached to the ice, it should be able to glide upon collisions, and should end away from the corners, to allow for corner-strokes. The top should have soft protection, to avoid players getting hurt if touching it when coming at high speed. The border was originally only used in Russia, but was introduced to other countries in the 1950s when the rules of the game were standardized and the international governing federation was founded. It allows for a faster game, as the ball stays in play instead of easily leaving the field, which means it would have to be collected and thrown in.\n\nIf the border is frozen to the ice during play, this can be hazardous to the players, and the referee can therefore decide to start or continue the game without such border. The same applies if strong wind relocates the border, under such circumstances the match can also be started or continued without border. This is regulated in comment section C1.8 of the Rules.\n\nThe border is made of sections which each should be about long according to section 1.2 of the Rules. Section 1.3 of the Rules prescribes where players must and must not enter or leave the field: Four of these sections of the border shall be painted red on the front side as well as on the backside. These four sections are placed at the middle of the side-line on one side of the field, in front of the players' benches. All exchange of players from both teams must take place over these red-painted border pieces, i.e. over a part of the border which is about 16 m long. According to comment section C3.3 of the Rules, a player who is to be replaced, shall have left the rink before the replacing player can enter the game. Section 1.3 also states that the erroneous exchange of players is to be punished with a penalty of 5 minutes for the in-going player (this length of penalty is shown by the referee displaying a white penalty card).\n\nA centre spot denotes the centre of the field and a circle of radius is centered at it. A centre-line is drawn through the centre spot and parallel with the shortlines.\n\nAt each of the corners, a radius quarter-circle is drawn, and a dotted line is painted parallel to the shortline and away from it without extending into the penalty area. The dotted line can be replaced with a long line starting at the edge of the penalty area and extending towards the sideline, from the shortline.\n\nCentered at each short-line is a wide and high goal cage, regulated to size, form, material and other properties in section 1.4 of the Rules. The cage may be made of wood, aluminium or steel and has a net to stop the ball when it has crossed the goal-line. The goal-line is the line between the goalposts; section 1.1. The cage shall be of an approved model; the approvement is made by the appropriate governing body. It shall be fitted with small spikes on underside to prevent the goal from being moved by the wind or by minor touch of a player, so that it stays in place. As long as the goal cage stays in place, the match can go on. For safety reasons, the goal-posts shall not have any sharp edges. The goal cage also has two ball baskets, one on each outer side; section 1.4 A. Balls are stored there for the goal-keeper to use when he is to set a ball in play if the ball has been shot over the end line at the side of the goal by a player from the opponent team. This allows the game to start up quicker when this has happened.\n\nIn front of the goal cage is a half-circular penalty area with a radius. A penalty spot is located in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a circle.\n\nEspecially for naturally frozen ice, it may occur that the ice is in too bad condition to play on. The ice shall be inspected by the referee before the game. If the referee deems that the condition of the ice is too bad, comment sections C1.1 and C1.2 allows him to decide that the match has to be cancelled. No one but the referee is allowed to decide on cancellation because of the condition of the ice (but this does not mean that either team is unable to alert the attention of the referee regarding some part of the condition of the ice).\n\nDeficiencies of the rink, including inferior ice quality, are the responsibility of the organiser of the match and according to comment section C1.4 deficiencies shall be reported to the administrative authority.\n\nOriginally, bandy was played on frozen lakes, but soon football fields were started to be used, by pouring water on them in the wintertime to get a good, flat and safe ice surface.\n\nStarting in the 1980s, and increasingly since 2000, more and more indoor bandy arenas have been built, especially in Russia and Sweden.\n"}

{"id": "426825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=426825", "title": "Caretaker manager", "text": "Caretaker manager\n\nIn association footballing terms, a caretaker manager is somebody who takes temporary charge of the management of a football club, usually when the regular manager is dismissed, or leaves for a different club. However, a caretaker may also be appointed if the regular manager is suspended, ill or unable to attend to their usual duties. Caretaker managers are normally appointed at short notice from within the club, usually the assistant manager, a senior coach, or an experienced player. In other sports, the term \"interim manager\" is more commonly used.\n\nCaretaker managers in Eastern Europe are head coaches that carry prefix title performing duties or sometimes temporary performing duties. These managers do not have a required license (UEFA Pro Licence) to be full pledged head coaches (managers).\n\nFamous examples include long-standing Arsenal assistant manager Stewart Houston, who stepped in after George Graham was abruptly sacked in the middle of the 1994–95 season and guided the club to the 1995 European Cup Winners' Cup Final. Tony Barton was appointed manager of Aston Villa after the departure of Ron Saunders and led the club to win the 1982 European Cup after only three months in charge. Club Director Trevor Brooking was appointed as caretaker manager of West Ham United following Glenn Roeder's illness at the end of the 2002–03 season, then again following his dismissal early in the 2003–04 season.\n\nIf a caretaker proves to be particularly successful during their spell in charge, they are sometimes given the manager's job permanently. Glenn Roeder was appointed permanent manager of Newcastle United after having taken over as caretaker following Graeme Souness' dismissal in 2006. This also occurred when Ricky Sbragia got the Sunderland job permanently after Roy Keane's resignation in November 2008 but he resigned himself at the end of the season 2008–09. This also happened in the 2010–11 Premier League; on 8 January 2011, Roy Hodgson was sacked by Liverpool after a run of poor results, and with Liverpool languishing in 12th place, Kenny Dalglish was appointed the caretaker manager of Liverpool for the remainder of the season. After an impressive run of results, which saw Liverpool rise to 6th on the table, Dalglish was appointed the permanent manager of Liverpool, on a three-year contract.\n\nIn Norway, a notable example occurred in 2006 when Rosenborg BK manager Per-Mathias Høgmo announced he was taking a leave of absence in mid-season, citing health concerns. At the time, Rosenborg were ten points behind leaders SK Brann. His assistant Knut Tørum was appointed on an interim basis, and proceeded to lead Rosenborg to a furious comeback, clinching the league title with one match to spare. Høgmo announced his resignation two days after Rosenborg clinched, and Tørum was named permanent manager after the season.\n\nOn the other hand, Tony Parkes was named caretaker manager of Blackburn Rovers on six separate occasions between 1986 and 2004, without ever being given the role in a permanent capacity. He is still yet to be given a permanent managerial role.\n\nIn November 2007, Sandy Stewart led St Johnstone to victory in the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup in his only game in charge as caretaker manager.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, Cevat Güler won Süper Lig as Galatasaray's caretaker manager. He was in charge for the last five matches of the season due to Karl Heinz Feldkamp's resignation.\n\nIn the 2007 Hazfi Cup final, Sepahan's head coach, Luka Bonačić had travelled to his country, Croatia for personal reasons and was unavailable to manage the team in the second leg. Mansour Ebrahimzadeh who was assistant to Bonačić served as caretaker manager for that match. Sepahan won the match and the title.\n\nGuus Hiddink was caretaker manager of Chelsea in 2009, leading his team to the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League where they shut out FC Barcelona at Camp Nou and tied them back at Stamford Bridge (the latter being a very controversial game, the match official being Tom Henning Øvrebø, with Chelsea eliminated on away goals), and finished off his tenure with the team as they won the FA Cup The club was reported happy to have Hiddink as manager even on a temporary basis.\n\nRoberto Di Matteo won the Champions League and FA Cup as caretaker manager of Chelsea in 2012, leading to him being appointed permanent manager on a two-year contract. He was sacked a few months into the new season, being replaced by another caretaker manager, Rafael Benítez, who led his team to victory in the Europa League, as well as guiding the team to a third-place finish in the league, thus ensuring direct qualification for next year's Champions League. Benítez was not offered a contract as permanent manager, instead being replaced by José Mourinho who went back to Chelsea for a second term.\n\n"}

{"id": "1471550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1471550", "title": "Colo-Colo", "text": "Colo-Colo\n\nClub Social y Deportivo Colo-Colo () is a Chilean football club based in Macul, Santiago. Founded in 1925, they play in the Chilean Primera División, from which they have never been relegated. The team has played its home games at Estadio Monumental David Arellano since 1989. Colo-Colo is regarded as the most successful club of Chilean football.\n\nColo-Colo has won more Primera División de Chile (32) than any other Chilean club and a record eleven Copa Chile titles. It was the first Chilean team to win a continental tournament conquering the 1991 Copa Libertadores after beating Club Olimpia 3–0 on 5 June with Mirko Jozić as manager. Next year, the club went on to win two international titles that were 1992 Recopa Sudamericana and 1992 Copa Interamericana, completing the club's three international honours.\n\nThe club's most successful player is Luis Mena with eleven titles, the historic top scorer is Francisco Valdés with 208 goals, and the player with most appearances is the former goalkeeper Misael Escuti with 417 games.\n\nColo-Colo is the team with most supporters in Chile, and holds a long-standing rivalry with Club Universidad de Chile. The club also holds a traditional rivalry in matches against C.D. Cobreloa and Club Deportivo Universidad Católica. The IFFHS ranked the team in 14th place in 2007. In 2009, that same institution named the team as the 20th century's top club of its country, and also within the top twenty clubs in South American football history.\n\nThe team was founded in early 1925 by Magallanes' footballer David Arellano, who led a group of young players leaving that club after institutional problems. Finally, on 19 April, Arellano and the other youths officially established the institutions after meetings and negotiations, where Luis Contreras chose the name Colo-Colo for the club, which refers to the eponymous Mapuche cacique Colo Colo.\n\nThe team began to play friendly games, but in 1926, Colo-Colo took part in the Metropolitan League of Honour, where they were proclaimed champions (in unbeaten way) and earned the nickname of \"invincible\". The following year, Colo-Colo became the first Chilean football team to participate in a tour across Europe. However, on 2 May, during an exhibition match against Real Unión Deportiva at Valladolid, the team founder and captain David Arellano was critically injured after suffering a collision with an opposing player, which caused him peritonitis. The inflammation led him to his death the next day. Despite the great impact caused by Arellano’s death, the club won the Central League of football tournament – then renamed Asociación de Football de Santiago – in the 1928, 1929 and 1930 seasons.\n\nIn the 1931–32 season, Colo-Colo suffered its first institutional crisis due to financial problems, which led to a salary reduction for first team footballers and board members, with their consequent resistance. That season the team played another tournament final against Audax Italiano. However, due to a platform collapse at Estadio Italiano and the subsequent bracas between the fans, it was decided the game suspension. In that moment, Colo-Colo were winning 2–1. That day's tragedy resulted in 130 injuries and three deaths. The match was canceled and the champion position for that year remained vacant. Other authors however declared that both Audax Italiano and Colo-Colo were declared champions.\n\nIn 1933, Colo-Colo alongside six clubs from Santiago decided to create the Chilean professional football league. On 23 July, the team won the Campeonato de Apertura (Copa Chile precursor), after defeating 2–1 to Unión Española. However, in the first Primera División official tournament, Colo-Colo finished first alongside Magallanes, which forced the \"Cacique\" to play a tie-breaker match. That match was lost 2–1 by Colo-Colo. In 1937 the team was undefeated, and reached its first league title. Two seasons later, in 1939, Colo-Colo won for second time a league title, now under the guidance of the Hungarian coach Francisco Platko, and with Alfonso Domínguez as goalscorer with 20 goals in 24 matches. After another title in 1941 with Platko as coach, the club went on to win the titles of 1944 and 1947. The following year Colo-Colo organized the South American Club Championship – Copa Libertadores background – in Santiago, which brought together the 1947 continent’s champions. In 1945, the club had the worst season in its history, finishing penultimate in eleventh place only ahead of weak Badminton.\n\nIn the early 1950s, club's president Antonio Labán hired Newcastle United striker George Robledo, paying £25,000 for its signing. Robledo’s performances led the team to the titles of 1953 and 1956. During that age, the club acquired a terrain at Macul, where began the construction of Estadio Monumental. Besides the acquisition, the directive invested in a headquarters located at Santiago Centro (located at Cienfuegos 41) in 1953. The next decade Colo-Colo win the titles of 1960 and 1963. The 1963 team broke two top-tier records: Luis Hernán Álvarez scored 37 goals in a single season (the highest number of goals scored by a Colo-Colo footballer during a season) and the netting of the highest number of goals scored by a club in a season (130). The team won its tenth honour in 1970.\n\nIn 1972, now under the orders of coach Luis Álamos and with figures like Carlos Caszely and Francisco Valdés, the club won another championship. It also obtained the country's attendance record of 45,929 people for a single season. That team was the basis of the so-called \"Colo-Colo 73\", the first Chilean team to reach a Copa Libertadores final, where it lost against Independiente of Argentina. After Colo-Colo's brilliant campaign, the club went into a competitiveness and institutional crisis not being able to win another league title until 1979. That team featured the talented Brazilian midfielder Severino Vasconcelos alongside a returning Caszely. Nevertheless, in 1975, the construction of Estadio Monumental was finished and the stadium was inaugurated in a league match against Deportes Aviación, but due to problems with the infrastructure and other basic services the stadium was indefinitely closed.\n\nIn the 1980s, the club obtained the league titles of 1981 and 1983 with coach Pedro García, and the 1986 and 1989 honours under Arturo Salah. The 1987 Alianza Lima air disaster claimed the lives of sixteen players and Colo-Colo was the first to help the Peruvian team, loaning them 4 players. Nonetheless the team won four Copa Chile titles in that decade. During that period, the greatest disappointment was at the continental tournament level with the team only exceeding the first stage in the 1988 Copa Libertadores. On September 30, 1989, the Estadio Monumental was re-inaugurated in an exhibition match against Peñarol, which Colo-Colo won 2–1 with goals by Marcelo Barticciotto and Leonel Herrera, the son of a 1970s legendary former defender of the same name.\n\nThe 1990s was the most successful decade in the club's history for the national and international honours achieved. Croatian Mirko Jozić arrived as coach, leading the team towards its first \"Bicampeonato\" for winning two national titles in a row. On June 5, 1991, after beating Olimpia 3–0 at Monumental with two goals by Luis Pérez and one by Leonel Herrera, Colo-Colo became the first Chilean team to win a Copa Libertadores. That same season, the \"Albos\" lost the Intercontinental Cup final against Yugoslavian club Red Star Belgrade, after being defeated 3–0 in Tokyo. At the local level, the club won the 1991 league, its third-consecutive title thus achieving its first \"Tricampeonato\". The following season, the club won the Recopa Sudamericana, after beating Brazil's Cruzeiro in a penalty shootout, and also obtained the Copa Interamericana, after winning 3–1 against Puebla in Mexico. The last title won by Jozić in Colo-Colo was the 1993 league title, thus closing a successful spell in South America.\n\nAfter Jozić's departure came a little drought in national titles, but the team managed to get an unforgettable 3-0 win over arch rivals Universidad de Chile in 1995. The team was champion of the 1994 Copa Chile and reached the 1994 Copa Libertadores quarterfinals. The following season saw the arrival of Paraguayan coach Gustavo Benítez, who obtained the 1996, 1997-C and 1998 league titles. The team advanced to the semifinals of the Supercopa Libertadores in 1996, and of the Copa Libertadores in 1997, being eliminated both times by Cruzeiro. In 1999, Colo-Colo relived something like 1994, finishing fourth in the Chilean league and having three coaches during that single season: Brazilian Nelsinho Baptista, the caretaker manager Carlos Durán and then Fernando Morena of Uruguay, who remained until 2001.\n\nIn 1999, after Benítez's departure, the club entered a serious financial crisis. In 23 January 2002, after years of economic mismanagement under the leadership of Peter Dragicevic as president, the club was declared bankrupt. Justice named Juan Carlos Saffie as syndic responsible for the institution allowing it not to lose its legal status. Despite the bankruptcy, under Jaime Pizarro as coach – key player in the obtaining of the 1991 Copa Libertadores – Los Albos won the Torneo de Clausura, with an almost completely juvenile squad. Three years later, in 2005, the joint-stock company Blanco y Negro took over the administration, concessioning all club assets for thirty years in exchange for paying all debts through an opening process at the Santiago Stock Exchange. In the first half of 2006, the judiciary court declared the bankruptcy over.\nWith the Argentine Claudio Borghi as coach since 2006, and with players like Matías Fernández and Humberto Suazo, Colo-Colo obtained a \"Bicampeonato\" winning the Apertura and Clausura tournaments. The squad reached another international final, the Copa Sudamericana, losing 2–1 to Mexico's side Pachuca. That season, \"El Cacique\" was recognized by the IFFHS as the world's club of the month. The following season Colo-Colo won two more consecutive tournaments, winning a \"Tetracampeonato\" for winning four back-to-back championships, being the first Chilean team to achieve that.\n\nAfter Borghi's departure, the club obtained its 28th title after defeating Palestino in the 2008 Torneo de Clausura finals under the coaching of Marcelo Barticciotto, and with Lucas Barrios as principal scorer, who equaled Luis Hernán Álvarez's record of highest number of goals scored by a Colo-Colo footballer during a single season with 37 goals. The following season, the club became the first professional team to play on Easter Island. After a poor Torneo de Apertura 2009 – not reaching the play-offs for the first time – Los Albos started the Clausura very close to relegation positions. However, the team reached the tournament's finals against Universidad Católica, beating them 4–2 in Santa Laura, with players like Esteban Paredes, Macnelly Torres and Ezequiel Miralles, coached by Hugo Tocalli. Colo-Colo's last championship was in 2014 after winning the Torneo de Clausura. It was the team's 30th Chilean League title.\n\nThe club's badge represents Mapuche chieftain Colo Colo, an important Wall Mapu member who battled in the Arauco War against the Spanish empire (1536–1818). On 19 April 1925, when the club was established, Luis Contreras – one of the players that founded the club – defined the team's badge, in representation of the chief and the country's indigenous people.\n\nThroughout its history, Colo-Colo’s uniform has been a white shirt and black shorts. The uniform was originally designed by Juan Quiñones following the recommendations of David Arellano.\n\nIn 1927, after Arellano’s died while playing against Real Unión Deportiva (currently Real Valladolid), it was decided then that the badge will wear a black horizontal band over it forever, to represent the institution's eternal mourning.\n\nThe team’s away kits have varied through its history, from green between 1927 and the mid-1970s and to red from 1975 to 1988.\n\nColo-Colo initially played on a field called Estadio El Llano but in January 1928 moved to the Campos de Sports de Ñuñoa. The team later moved to Estadio Nacional where it played from 1939 to the late 1980s. In 1946 the club bought a stadium from Carabineros de Chile – then called \"Fortín Mapocho\" – which was closed according security reasons. It was intended to build a 30,000 seat stadium at the site. However, a municipal ordinance prohibited construction in the area. For that reason, Colo-Colo sold the stadium in order to raise funds for the future Estadio Monumental.\n\nIn 1956, club's president Antonio Labán acquired a 28 ha terrain at Macul, close to the intersection between Vicuña Mackenna and Departamental. The new stadium was originally planned with a capacity of 120,000. Due to the work's high cost and lack of a government subsidy the project was halted. In 1960, after Chile's successful proposition to hold the World Cup, several congressmen proposed to build a 52,000-seat stadium at Colo-Colo's site. However, the 9.5 Valdivia earthquake and a willingness from congress stopped the initiative.\n\nColo-Colo's brilliant campaigns in 1972 and 1973 allowed the stadium construction to resume. It was inaugurated in a league match 1975 which Colo-Colo win 1–0 over Deportes Aviación with Juan Carlos Orellana, who become the first player to score a goal in Monumental's history. However, the stadium was closed due to lack of basic services and infrastructure. It was not reopened until 1989 thanks to Hugo Rubio's transfer to Bologna which allowed the club to receive US$1 million to repair the problems mentioned. The stadium was called \"Monumental David Arellano\" in honour of its founder and its definitive inauguration was in a match against Uruguay's Peñarol which Colo-Colo won 2–1.\n\nSince its definitive opening, the stadium has seen the 1991 Copa Libertadores and 1992 Copa Interamericana titles as well as several league honors.\n\nMonumental's public record attendance was in 1992 for a derby match with Universidad de Chile which registered an attendance of 70,000 fans approximately. That record was closely followed in August 1993 during a 2–0 exhibition match win over Real Madrid with a 67,543 attendance. Several remodeling works and stricter security brought down the total capacity to 47,347.\n\nThe Chilean national team usually use the stadium for its games since 1997. The stadium was also used during the 2015 Copa América.\n\nColo-Colo is the club with the largest following in Chile, with approximately 42% of the total Chilean football fans according to research published in August 2012 by Spanish newspaper agency Marca. The study showed a 4% growth in comparison to 2006 research by Fundación Futuro that ranked the club in first place with the 38% of the preferences, leaving its rival Universidad de Chile in second place.\n\nSince the early 1960s, the club has had organized fan groups, which evolved in the mid-1980s into the so-called \"Garra Blanca\". They attended Colo-Colo's games and generally rioted, especially in derbies, turning Estadio Monumental surroundings into battlefields against the military police. In 2000, the group was declared as Barra brava.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2575024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2575024", "title": "Energy Brands", "text": "Energy Brands\n\nEnergy Brands, also doing business as Glacéau, is a privately owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company based in Whitestone, Queens, New York that manufactures and distributes various lines of enhanced water. Founded in May 1996 by J. Darius Bikoff with an electrolyte enhanced line of water called Smartwater, Energy Brands initially distributed its products to health food stores and independent retailers in the New York area. Adding Fruitwater and Vitaminwater to its line in 1998 and 2000, respectively, the company expanded to nationwide distribution in the early 2000s.\n\nBy 2002, the Glacéau line of waters were the top selling enhanced water brand in the United States, with the company's Vitaminwater being its best selling product. In 2006, the company earned US$350 million in revenues. The company then began its global expansion, launching its products in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2008, France in 2009 and Argentina in 2011.\n\nEnergy Brands is owned primarily by Bikoff, employees, and small investors. Rapper 50 Cent obtained a minority share of the company as part of an endorsement deal in the company. 30% of the equity was sold to LVMH sometime in the 2000s, which in turn sold those shares. The shares eventually were sold to India-based Tata Group in August 2006, which held the shares until May 2007 when The Coca-Cola Company purchased the company as an independent subsidiary, leaving its actual operations with its existing management including Bikoff.\n\nJ. Darius Bikoff, a self-proclaimed health nut born on September 21, 1961, first conceived of the idea of vitamin enhanced water in 1996. According to him, he was feeling \"run down\" and concerned he was catching a cold, so he took some Vitamin C and drank some mineral water. As he consumed the items, he started thinking about the idea of having them together instead of having to take them separately. He founded Energy Brands in May 1996 using his personal savings and contracting with an aquifer in Connecticut for the base water used. The individual products carried the Glacéau name, with the company's first product being Glacéau Smartwater.\n\nReflecting on the company's early history, Bikoff notes that it was \"very tough\" as he struggled with founding the company having no actual experience in beverage manufacturing, beyond working in an aluminum fabrication factory. While launching his company, he was also having to deal with personal struggles including a divorce and having to file for bankruptcy. He started by personally introducing Smartwater to smaller independent natural food stores around New York, moving to a statewide launch when the product became successful. He used this same basic method, adding in \"mom-and-pop stores\", for the launches of Fruitwater and Vitaminwater in 1998 and 2000, respectively. By 2001, the company's drinks were sold in over 4,000 retail stores in the New York area. According to Bikoff, this enabled his products to go unnoticed by the large beverage makers until the product was firmly established when he could then cultivate relationships with various independent distributors opening the way for nationwide distribution.\n\nBikoff eventually allowed LVMH to buy a 30% equity share in the company. LVMH later sold the stake to another investor, who in turn sold it again. The shares ended up in the hands of India-based Tata Group in August 2006, which paid $677 million for the 30% equity, seeking to expand its American business interests.\n\nOn May 25, 2007, the company was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company for $4.1 billion in cash.\n\n$1.2 billion of the sales went to the Tata Group for its 30% minority ownership, which Tata agreed to sell. Under the purchase agreement, Energy Brands remains nearly autonomous as a subsidiary of Coca-Cola, with Coca-Cola primarily operating with a hands off method, leaving Bikoff and Energy Brands principal operating officers in charge. In discussing the role of Coca-Cola, Bikoff states: \"We run independently, we have our own offices. If Coca-Cola don't call me, I don't call them.\"\n\nIn 2008, Energy Brands began launching its products in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2008, with France following in 2009 and Argentina in 2011. The company eventually plans to expand to Canada and Mexico.\n\nOn April 5, 2006, Energy Brands filed a lawsuit against PepsiCo in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan alleging that PepsiCo's SoBe \"Life Water\" packages infringed its trade dress for similar drinks. In the subsequent settlement Pepsi agreed to change its packaging.\n\nOn January 14, 2009, the Center for Science in the Public Interest filed a class-action lawsuit against Energy Brands' parent company in the Northern District of California Court. The suit alleges that the marketing of the drink as a \"healthful alternative\" to soda is deceptive and in violation of Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The consumer group states that \"according to CSPI nutritionists, the 33 grams of sugar in each bottle of Vitaminwater do more to promote obesity, diabetes and other health problems than the vitamins in the drinks do to perform the advertised benefits listed on the bottles\". Coca-Cola dismissed the allegations as \"ridiculous,\" on the grounds that \"no consumer could reasonably be misled into thinking Vitaminwater was a healthy beverage\" and an attempt by the group to increase its readership.\n\nIn 2011, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered the coordination of different lawsuits against Coca-Cola Co. that alleged it misled the public about the nutritional benefits of Vitaminwater.\n\nAs a privately owned company, Energy Brands has never been required to release information about its sales figures or other financial information. Bikoff himself never stated what percentage of the company he owned before it was sold. \"Forbes\" magazine once reported that he owned only 25% of the company, but in an interview with \"The Times\", he denied this stating: \"Did anyone say I had less than 50%? Look, I maintained control of the company and I maintain it today. But I don’t talk about my share as every story becomes one about personal wealth.\" In 2006, the company was reported to have an annual sales revenue of $350 million.\n\nBefore the sale to Coca-Cola, 70% shares of the company were held by company employees and smaller investors, with 30% held by the Tata Group. In October 2004, rapper Curtis Jackson—known as 50 Cent—was given a minority share in the company in exchange for becoming a spokesperson after learning that he was a fan of the beverage. The health conscious Jackson noted that he first learned of the product while at a gym in Los Angeles, and stated that \"they do such a good job making water taste good.\" After becoming a shareholder and endorser, Jackson worked with the company to create a new grape-flavored \"Formula 50\" variant of VitaminWater and mentioned the drinks in various songs and interviews. It's unknown how much Jackson made from the purchase of his shares by Coca-cola, with estimates in the financial press mainly in the $100 – 400million range. Though he no longer has an equity stake in the company, Jackson continues to act as a spokesperson for Vitaminwater, enthusiastically supporting the product including singing about it at the BET Awards and expressing his excitement over the company's continuing to allow his input on products.\n\nEnergy Brands' first product was Glacéau Smartwater, vapor-distilled water with added electrolytes, which was released at the company's launch in 1996. Glaceau Fruitwater, adding zero-calorie fruit flavors to the core Smartwater, followed in 1998. In 2000, Vitaminwater was launched, adding vitamins and natural flavors with Smartwater. Designed to \"fill the gap\" between soft drinks and water for people who knew they should be drinking more water but weren't, Vitaminwater was targeted primarily at adults. With fewer calories than soda, the company states that the drink both hydrates consumers and provides nutrients they are likely to be missing.\n\nIn 2002, Energy Brands' Glacéau drinks were the top selling brand of enhanced water. Vitaminwater is considered its most successful of the four products. On April 2, 2009, Glacéau Vitaminwater introduced a new line for the weight-conscious market called Vitaminwater10 that has 10 calories per eight-ounce serving, and later Vitaminwater Zero, a calorie-free drink, down from the older line that serves 50 kilocalories. Both drinks include Truvia as a sweetener. Vitaminwater Zero also uses Erythritol. In September 2010, a rebranded version of the 10 calorie drink was introduced to the Canadian market, although Vitaminwater Zero is still exclusively a US product.\n\nVitaminWater is a mineral water product distributed by Energy Brands and was introduced in 2000. Some ingredients are added according to the flavor and intended purpose of the drink.\n\nIn 2008, the Australian consumer organisation Choice gave one of its annual 'Shonky' awards to VitaminWater, saying that, despite the claim that the drinks were healthy, \"one bottle contains about a third of the recommended daily sugar intake for an average adult woman ... and none contains more than 1% fruit juice\". Choice also noted that the label on one flavour blatantly mocked food regulations designed to protect consumers by stating, \"We are prohibited from making exaggerated claims about the potency of the nutrients in this bottle\", before making exaggerated claims about the potency of the nutrients in the bottle.\n\nIn January 2011, the United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that a Summer 2010 advertisement that claimed VitaminWater was \"nutritious\" was misleading due to the high sugar content (23 g per 500 ml) of the drink. The ruling banning the advertisement stated: \"Because Vitamin Water contained about a quarter of a consumer's GDA (guideline daily amount) for sugar as well as the added vitamins, we considered that the description of Vitamin Water as 'nutritious' was misleading\".\n\n\n\nSmartwater is vapor-distilled water with electrolytes added for taste. It is not a significant source of fat, \"trans\" fat, cholesterol, dietary fiber, vitamin D, calcium, iron and potassium. It is available in 600 mL, 700 mL, 850 mL, 1 L, 1.5 L, and 20 oz bottles.\n\nJennifer Aniston has been the spokesperson of the brand since 2007.\n\nvitaminenergy is an energy drink which consists of many of the same ingredients as vitaminwater, such as crystalline fructose, electrolytes, natural flavors, and vitamins (Vitamin B3, B5, B6, B12, and C) along with natural caffeine and ribose. Specific ingredients are added according to the flavor of the drink. Either 16 oz, 200 calories and 150 mg caffeine per can, or 2 oz, no calories. The vitaminenergy website does not show ingredients or amount of caffeine for the 'shot' product.\n\n\nfruitwater is a less sweetened version of Vitaminwater but is a sparkling water drink. It consists of the same ingredients only with a light fruit flavor and less crystalline fructose. Aside from “natural flavor,” fruitwater does not contain any actual fruit juice. Ingredients include Guarana seed, which has twice as much caffeine as coffee.\n\n"}

{"id": "46198746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46198746", "title": "Hajo Seppelt", "text": "Hajo Seppelt\n\nHajo Seppelt (born 1963 in Berlin) is a German journalist and author.\n\nSeppelt is the son of Alfred Seppelt, who was the head of the Berlin Chess Federation from 1984 to 2004.\n\nIn 1981, he obtained his college preparatory degree (Abitur) at the in Berlin's Lankwitz neighborhood. He studied sports, social studies, journalism and French at the Free University of Berlin for a few semesters but did not complete a degree.\n\nSince 1985, Seppelt has worked as a sports reporter for Germany's premier public broadcaster ARD. He has also worked for the Berlin public broadcaster Sender Freies Berlin and its 2003 successor Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg. After working for many years as a live commentary for swimming events for ARD, he was stripped of this duty in the early summer of 2006. Seppelt said that this was in reaction to a private email, in which he criticized ARD's uncritical reporting on doping, becoming public. Since 2006, he has worked as a freelance journalist for ARD and has made a number of reports and documentary films about doping.\n\nTogether with former Canadian swimmer Karin Helmstaedt, Seppelt made the documentary film \"Staatsgeheimnis Kinderdoping\" (State Secret Child Doping) about the perpetrators and victims of doping in East German swimming. It was broadcast by ARD. Together with Holger Schück, he published the book \"Anklage: Kinderdoping. Das Erbe des DDR-Sports\" (Indictment Doping: The Legacy of East German Sports) in 1999. It also dealt with the topic of state doping in Communist East Germany.\n\nIn 2006, Seppelt reported extensively about the doping problem in cycling. Among other things, his research led to the identification of the German physician Markus China as a member of the doping network organized by Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes. In November of that year, he was awarded the \"Leuchtturm für besondere publizistische Leistungen\" (\"Lighthouse Prize for Special Journalist Achievement\") by the journalists’ association Netzwerk Recherche for his research, reports and exclusive revelations about cyclists Jan Ullrich and Floyd Landis and Eufemiano Fuentes.\n\nIn the documentary “Mission: Clean Sport“ Hajo Seppelt and Jo Goll documented the work of German doping control officers. The film highlighted flaws in Germany's doping-control system and caused heady public discussions, which contributed to structural changes in Germany's National Anti Doping Agency (NADA). The report won the \"Silver Chest Award 2007\" at the International Television Film Festival in Plovdiv and the international \"Sports Movie and TV Award 2007\" in Milan. The film was also nominated for the \"German Television Prize\" and the \"Prix Europa\".\n\nIn mid-January the German Skiing Association (DSV) took legal action, and a Hamburg court issued an injunction against Seppelt for refusing to make a cease-and-desist declaration demanded by the DSV about suspicions that German cross-country skiers and biathletes had engaged in blood doping in a Vienna laboratory. A superior court in Hamburg overturned that ruling in Seppelt's favor, concluding that DSV had no right to demand the cease-and-desist declaration because it was not affected by the journalist's reporting. The ruling was based constitutional guarantees of journalist freedom in cases of anonymous sources. The judgement also overturned an injunction from October 21, 2008. Seppelt's suspicion could not be proved after extensive investigations.\n\nIn January 2012 Seppelt and colleagues from the Western German public broadcaster WDR had reports featured on ARD and WDR sports programs about the blood of thirty athletes being exposed to ultra-violet radiation by a sports doctor in the Eastern German city of Erfurt. Several of the athletes concerned were named. In the wake of the broadcasts, a discussion arose as to whether such procedures were banned according to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) code. WADA itself considered them to be. Anti-doping investigations of the athletes ended up with discontinuations and acquittals due to extenuating circumstances, and a criminal investigation of the doctor concerned was also discontinued. Nonetheless, many experts declared that blood treatments were banned in principle by the laws governing sports. The doctor tried to get a superior court in Cologne to issue an injunction against WDR, but the broadcaster won out, and the report was allowed to contain references to “forbidden blood treatments.”\n\nParallel with the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, ARD broadcast the 45-minute-documentary \"Olympia im Reich der Mittel: Doping in China\" (\"Flying High in the Middle Kingdom: Doping in China\"), which Seppelt made with Jo Goll. The film reported about doping and doping controls in China, in particularly above proven case of stem-cell manipulation carried out on top athletes. At the International New York Film Festival, it won a world gold medal for long-form reporting. It was also awarded the main prize at 2009 Sportfilm Liberec 2007 - World Facts Challenge festival.\n\nIn the spring and summer of 2012, Seppelt and Kempe reported for the first time about doping among Kenyan track-and-field athletes. The focus was primarily on practices among doctors in the background. One athlete told of widespread doping among Kenyan long-distance runners. The reports caused intense reactions in Kenya and met with considerable international resonance. As a result, doping controls were stepped up in the country.\n\nThe documentary \"Doping - Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics\" shows that it is relatively easy to obtain banned performance-enhancing drugs in Kenya. It traces the story of an impoverished young runner who seems to have died from the side effects of taking EPO.\n\nKenyan athletics authorities refused to speak with Seppelt about the issue, and his film presents circumstantial evidence of corruption among Kenyan sports functionaries. Former Boston marathon winner Rito Jeptoo asserts that Kenyan athletes are not subjected to blood tests while training. Another Kenyan runner claims that the national federation suppresses positive doping results in return for bribes.\n\nSeppelt also suggests the International Association of Athletics Federations isn't doing enough to address the problem of doping in endurance disciplines. After evaluating data on athletes' blood collected at major athletics competitions over a number of years, two Australian scientists conclude that doping is the only plausible explanation for some of the measurements. The IAAF also refused to speak with Seppelt about his suspicions.\n\nIn August 2015, he presented a nearly hour-long report questioning athletics in general and Kenya's long-distance runners in particular.\n\nShortly before the IAAF World Championships in London, German broadcaster ARD aired a new episode of \"Doping Top Secret\" in August 2017, titled \"The Big Money Run. Africa's Athletes on Sale.\" The feature by Hajo Seppelt, Benjamin Best, Ulrike Unfug, and Grit Hartmann particularly examines people surrounding and influencing African Athletes in track and field disciplines. It focuses not only on doping, but also delves into shady practices of managers and into the numerous changes of nationality that occur in this core Olympic sport.\n\nIn 2014, with the help of athletes who told their stories in front of the camera, Seppelt reported about widespread doping in Russia. In December of that year, ARD broadcast Seppelt's film \"Geheimsache Doping: Wie Russland seine Sieger macht\" (\"The Doping Secret: How Russia Makes its Winners\"). In this 60-minute documentary, whistleblowers testified to systematic doping in athletics and other sports in Russia. The film presents evidence for these allegations in form of footage and audio recordings secretly made by the whistleblowers as well as official documents. The documentary, which was followed a short time later by films in ARD and WDR, attracted substantial global media resonance and was broadcast worldwide in a number of languages. After its broadcast in Germany, several figures in international sports organizations and anti-doping institutions either resigned their posts or were suspended.\n\nIn March 2016, in its Sport Inside program, the WDR broadcast the third part of the series on doping in athletics with a focus on Russia: “Geheimsache Doping: Russlands Täuschungsmanöver” (“The Doping Secret: Russia’s Red Herrings”). In it, Hajo Seppelt, together with co-author Florian Riesewieck, showed how Russian coaches and officials avoided conditions of the World Athletics Federation IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA. The 30-minute documentary once again received an extensive international echo and was broadcast in several countries.\n\nIn November 2016 the documentary \"Doping - Top secret: The protection racket\" (by Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck, Olga Sviridenko and Felix Becker) is aired in ARD's weekly programme \"Sportschau\". It is based on a joint investigation by the French newspaper \"Le Monde\" and the ARD doping editorial team. The documentary is about criminal activities linked to doping and cover up in international athletics.\n\nIn May 2018 the German broadcaster ARD announced that Russia declared a visa void which was issued on request of the broadcaster so Seppelt could report on the 2018 FIFA World Cup, citing Russia that Seppelt is on the list of unwanted persons.\n\nIn May 2018 Hajo Seppelt and Florian Riesewieck produced another episode of the documentary series „Doping Top Secret“ in ARD – titled „Russia‘s Football Friends“. This time they focused on suspicious facts in football in Russia, host country of the World Cup.\n\nPrior to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, ARD broadcast the 45-minute-documentary “Flying High in the Middle Kingdom: Doping in China”, which Hajo Seppelt produced with Jo Goll. The film reported about doping and doping controls in China, in particular, about proven cases of stem-cell manipulation carried out on top athletes. At the International New York Film Festival, it won a world gold medal for long-form reporting. It was also awarded the main prize at the 2009 Sportfilm Liberec 2007 – World Facts Challenge Festival. \n\nPrior to the 2009 World Athletics Championships in Berlin, ARD broadcast the documentary “Doping Top Secret: The String-Pullers in Athletics“ by Hajo Seppelt and Robert Kempe about the people who pull the strings in doping in track-and-field.\n\nPrior to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, ARD broadcast the 30-minute feature “Geheimsache Doping Eiskalter Betrug” (“Doping Top Secret: „Ice-Cold Cheating”). In it, Hajo Seppelt, Robert Kempe and Jochen Leufgens took a look behind the scenes at winter sports.\n\nIn the wake of research by Seppelt in September 2010 about the world's top cyclist Alberto Contador, the Union Cycliste Internationale UCI had to admit that the Spanish Tour de France winner had turned up positive in doping tests. It emerged that the UCI had wanted to keep a positive test by Contador for the substance Clenbuterol at the Tour de France in July 2010 under wraps. In February 2012, Contador was retroactively banned for two years, from August 2010 to August 2012, by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for Clenbuterol use.\n\nIn May 2011, Seppelt and co-filmmaker Kempe had the chance to film footage about sports for a week in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. The result was the documentary film \"Sport in Nordkorea - Einblicke in eine unbekannte Welt\" (\"Sports in North Korea – A Look at an Unknown World\"), which was broadcast by ARD in July 2011.\n\nIn 2013, Seppelt and Kempe completed a critical documentary about Thomas Bach, shortly before he was elected president of the International Olympic Committee.\nIn January 2017 Germany's ARD television aired another part of its “Doping Top Secret” series. The new episode focussed on Russian whistleblower Andrey Dmitriev. Frustrated with the persistence of doping in his home country's athletics community, the runner made secret video recordings. The footage enabled him to prove that a big-name coach suspended due to doping links is still working with athletes.\n\nIn April 2017, Hajo Seppelt and his colleague Thilo Neumann revealed the existence of positive doping tests for Clenbuterol in the context of follow-up checks during the 2008 Olympic Games in Peking. The journalists also uncovered that the IOC kept these results a secret in consultation with WADA. Research showed that the IOC did not follow up on these cases, even though the organization's regulations demand further investigation in case of positive doping tests. Among the athletes who were tested positive, there was at least one Jamaican sprinter. The IOC's declaration, stating that the positive tests were a result of the athletes’ consumption of meat from China which supposedly contained Clenbuterol and that therefore there where no investigations concerning other possible causes, engendered worldwide criticism.\n\nIn June 2017 the German Broadcaster a new Episode of „Doping Top Secret“, titled „Brazil’s dirty game“, was aired by ARD. The documentary by Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck und Thilo Neumann examined the topic of doping in the host country of the last Football World Championships and of the last Olympic Games. Massive failings and shortcomings of Brazil's doping prevention plans where substantiated. Additionally, a multitude of indications for a culture of doping, deeply rooted in Brazili Football and stretching up to the national elite could be found.\n\nIn June 2018 on occasion of the Football World Cup in Russia ARD German TV aired a documentary titled „Doping Top secret: Brazil’s Twelfth man“ (Authors: Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck, Edmund Willison) about doping in Brazilian football.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Doping – Top Secret: How Russia makes its winners” and “Doping – Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48339", "title": "Parachute", "text": "Parachute\n\nA parachute is a device used to slow the motion of an object through an atmosphere by creating drag (or in the case of ram-air parachutes, aerodynamic lift). Parachutes are usually made out of light, strong fabric, originally silk, now most commonly nylon. They are typically dome-shaped, but vary, with rectangles, inverted domes, and others found. A variety of loads are attached to parachutes, including people, food, equipment, space capsules, and bombs.\n\nA drogue chute is used to aid horizontal deceleration of a vehicle including fixed-wing aircraft and drag racers, provide stability, as to assist certain types of light aircraft in distress, tandem free-fall; and as a pilot triggering deployment of a larger parachute.\n\nThe earliest fictional account of a parachute type of device was made some 4,000 years ago when the Chinese noticed that air resistance would slow a person's fall from a height. The Western Han Dynasty writer Sima Qian in his book \"Historical Records\" recounts the story of Shun, a legendary Chinese emperor who ran away from his murderous father by climbing onto the top of a high granary. As there was nowhere to go, Shun grabbed two bamboo hats and leaped off and glided downward to safety.\n\nThe earliest evidence for the modern parachute dates back to the Renaissance period. The oldest parachute design appears in an anonymous manuscript from 1470s Renaissance Italy (British Museum Add. MSS 34,113, fol. 200v), showing a free-hanging man clutching a crossbar frame attached to a conical canopy. As a safety measure, four straps ran from the ends of the rods to a waist belt, marked improvement over another folio (189v), which depicts a man trying to break the force of his fall by the means of two long cloth streamers fastened to two bars which he grips with his hands. Although the surface area of the first design appears to be too small to be effective and the wooden frame is superfluous and potentially harmful, the basic concept of a working parachute is apparent.\n\nShortly after, a more sophisticated parachute was sketched by the polymath Leonardo da Vinci in his \"Codex Atlanticus\" (fol. 381v) dated to ca. 1485. Here, the scale of the parachute is in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper. Leonardo's canopy was held open by a square wooden frame, which alters the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal. It is not known whether the Italian inventor was influenced by the earlier design, but he may have learned about the idea through the intensive oral communication among artist-engineers of the time. The feasibility of Leonardo's pyramidal design was successfully tested in 2000 by Briton Adrian Nicholas and again in 2008 by the Swiss skydiver Olivier Vietti-Teppa. According to the historian of technology Lynn White, these conical and pyramidal designs, much more elaborate than early artistic jumps with rigid parasols in Asia, mark the origin of \"the parachute as we know it.\"\nThe Croatian polymath and inventor Fausto Veranzio (1551–1617) examined da Vinci's parachute sketch and kept the square frame but replaced the canopy with a bulging sail-like piece of cloth that he came to realize decelerates a fall more effectively. A now-famous depiction of a parachute that he dubbed \"Homo Volans\" (Flying Man), showing a man parachuting from a tower, presumably St Mark's Campanile in Venice, appeared in his book on mechanics, \"Machinae Novae\" (\"New Machines\", published in 1615 or 1616), alongside a number of other devices and technical concepts.\n\nIt was once widely believed that in 1617, Veranzio, then aged 65 and seriously ill, implemented his design and tested the parachute by jumping from St Mark's Campanile, from a bridge nearby, or from St Martin's Cathedral in Bratislava. In various publications it was errantly claimed the event was documented some thirty years later by John Wilkins, founder and secretary of the Royal Society in London, in his book \"Mathematical Magick or, the Wonders that may be Performed by Mechanical Geometry\", published in London in 1648. However, Wilkins wrote about flying, not parachutes, and does not mention Veranzio, a parachute jump, or any event in 1617. Doubts about this test, which include a lack of written evidence, suggest it never occurred, and was instead a misreading of historical notes.\n\nThe modern parachute was invented in the late 18th century by Louis-Sébastien Lenormand in France, who made the first recorded public jump in 1783. Lenormand also sketched his device beforehand.\n\nTwo years later, in 1785, Lenormand coined the word \"parachute\" by hybridizing an Italian prefix \"para\", an imperative form of \"parare\" = to avert, defend, resist, guard, shield or shroud, from \"paro\" = to parry, and \"chute\", the French word for \"fall\", to describe the aeronautical device's real function.\n\nAlso in 1785, Jean-Pierre Blanchard demonstrated it as a means of safely disembarking from a hot-air balloon. While Blanchard's first parachute demonstrations were conducted with a dog as the passenger, he later claimed to have had the opportunity to try it himself in 1793 when his hot air balloon ruptured and he used a parachute to descend (this event was not witnessed by others).\n\nSubsequent development of the parachute focused on it becoming more compact. While the early parachutes were made of linen stretched over a wooden frame, in the late 1790s, Blanchard began making parachutes from folded silk, taking advantage of silk's strength and light weight. In 1797, André Garnerin made the first descent of a \"frameless\" parachute covered in silk. In 1804 Jérôme Lalande introduced a vent in the canopy to eliminate violent oscillations.\n\nIn 1907 Charles Broadwick demonstrated two key advances in the parachute he used to jump from hot air balloons at fairs: he folded his parachute into a pack he wore on his back and the parachute was pulled from the pack by a static line attached to the balloon. When Broadwick jumped from the balloon, the static line became taut, pulled the parachute from the pack, and then snapped.\n\nIn 1911 a successful test took place with a dummy at the Eiffel tower in Paris. The puppet's weight was 75 kg; the parachute's weight was 21 kg. The cables between puppet and the parachute were 9 m long. On February 4, 1912, Franz Reichelt jumped to his death from the tower during initial testing of his wearable parachute.\nAlso in 1911, Grant Morton made the first parachute jump from an airplane, a Wright Model B piloted by Phil Parmalee, at Venice Beach, California. Morton's device was of the \"throw-out\" type where he held the parachute in his arms as he left the aircraft. In the same year, Russian Gleb Kotelnikov invented the first knapsack parachute, although Hermann Lattemann and his wife Käthe Paulus had been jumping with bagged parachutes in the last decade of the 19th century.\n\nIn 1912, on a road near Tsarskoye Selo, years before it became part of St. Petersburg, Kotelnikov successfully demonstrated the braking effects of a parachute by accelerating a Russo-Balt automobile to its top speed and then opening a parachute attached to the back seat, thus also inventing the drogue parachute.\n\nOn March 1, 1912, U.S. Army Captain Albert Berry made the first (attached-type) parachute jump in the United States from a fixed-wing aircraft, a Benoist pusher, while flying above Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis, Missouri. The jump utilized a knapsack style parachute stored or housed in a casing on the jumper's body.\n\nŠtefan Banič, an immigrant in the United States, from Slovakia patented an umbrella-like design in 1914 and sold (or donated) the patent to the United States military which later on modified his design, resulting in the first military parachute. Stefan Banic had been the first person to patent the parachute. Stefan Banic's design was the first to properly function in the 20th century.\n\nOn June 21, 1913, Georgia Broadwick became the first woman to parachute-jump from a moving aircraft, doing so over Los Angeles, California.\nIn 1914, while doing demonstrations for the U.S. Army, Broadwick deployed her chute manually, thus becoming the first person to jump free-fall.\nThe first military use of the parachute was by artillery observers on tethered observation balloons in World War I. These were tempting targets for enemy fighter aircraft, though difficult to destroy, due to their heavy anti-aircraft defenses. Because it was difficult to escape from them, and dangerous when on fire due to their hydrogen inflation, observers would abandon them and descend by parachute as soon as enemy aircraft were seen. The ground crew would then attempt to retrieve and deflate the balloon as quickly as possible. The main part of the parachute was in a bag suspended from the balloon with the pilot wearing only a simple waist harness attached to the main parachute. When the balloon crew jumped the main part of the parachute was pulled from the bag by the crew's waist harness, first the shroud lines, followed by the main canopy. This type of parachute was first adopted on a large scale for their observation balloon crews by the Germans, and then later by the British and French. While this type of unit worked well from balloons, it had mixed results when used on fixed-wing aircraft by the Germans, where the bag was stored in a compartment directly behind the pilot. In many instances where it did not work the shroud lines became entangled with the spinning aircraft. Although a number of famous German fighter pilots were saved by this type of parachute, including Hermann Göring, no parachutes were issued to Allied \"heavier-than-air\" aircrew, since it was thought at the time that if a pilot had a parachute he would jump from the plane when hit rather than trying to save the aircraft.\n\nAirplane cockpits at that time also were not large enough to accommodate a pilot and a parachute, since a seat that would fit a pilot wearing a parachute would be too large for a pilot not wearing one. This is why the German type was stowed in the fuselage, rather than being of the \"backpack\" type. Weight was – at the very beginning – also a consideration since planes had limited load capacity. Carrying a parachute impeded performance and reduced the useful offensive and fuel load.\n\nIn the U.K., Everard Calthrop, a railway engineer and breeder of Arab horses, invented and marketed through his Aerial Patents Company a \"British Parachute\" and the \"Guardian Angel\" parachute. Thomas Orde-Lees, known as the \"Mad Major,\" demonstrated that parachutes could be used successfully from a low height (he jumped from Tower Bridge in London) which led to parachutes being used by the balloonists of the Royal Flying Corps, though they were not available for aircraft.\n\nIn 1911, Solomon Lee Van Meter, Jr. of Lexington Kentucky, submitted for and in July 1916 received a patent for a backpack style parachute – the Aviatory Life Buoy. His self-contained device featured a revolutionary quick-release mechanism – the ripcord – that allowed a falling aviator to expand the canopy only when safely away from the disabled aircraft.\n\nOtto Heinecke, a German airship ground crewman, designed a parachute which the German air service introduced in 1918, becoming the world's first air service to introduce a standard parachute. Although many pilots were saved by these, their efficacy was relatively poor. Out of the first 70 German airmen to bail out, around a third died, including aces such as Oberleutnant Erich Löwenhardt (who fell from after being accidentally rammed by another German aircraft) and Fritz Rumey who tested it in 1918, only to have it fail at a little over . These fatalities were mostly due to the chute or ripcord becoming entangled in the airframe of their spinning aircraft or because of harness failure, a problem fixed in later versions.\n\nThe French, British, American and Italian air services later based their first parachute designs on the Heinecke parachute to varying extents.\n\nIn the UK Sir Frank Mears who was serving as a Major in the Royal Flying Corps in France (Kite Balloon section) registered a patent in July 1918 for a parachute with a quick release buckle, known as the \"Mears parachute\" which was in common use from then onwards.\n\nThe experience with parachutes during the war highlighted the need to develop a design that could be reliably used to exit a disabled airplane. For instance, tethered parachutes did not work well when the aircraft was spinning. After the war, Major Edward L. Hoffman of the United States Army led an effort to develop an improved parachute by bringing together the best elements of multiple parachute designs. Participants in the effort included Leslie Irvin and James Floyd Smith. The team eventually created the Airplane Parachute Type-A. This incorporated three key elements.\n\nIn 1919, Irvin successfully tested the parachute by jumping from an airplane. The Type-A parachute was put into production and over time saved a number of lives. The effort was recognized by the awarding of the Robert J. Collier Trophy to Major Edward L. Hoffman in 1926.\n\nIrvin became the first person to make a premeditated free-fall parachute jump from an airplane. An early brochure of the Irvin Air Chute Company credits William O'Connor as having become, on August 24, 1920, at McCook Field near Dayton, Ohio, the first person to be saved by an Irvin parachute. Another life-saving jump was made at McCook Field by test pilot Lt. Harold H. Harris on October 20, 1922. Shortly after Harris' jump, two Dayton newspaper reporters suggested the creation of the Caterpillar Club for successful parachute jumps from disabled aircraft.\n\nIn July 4, 1924 (patent №1607) Gleb Kotelnikov of Russia became the first parachutist to apply the soft packing of a parachute instead of a hard casing.\n\nBeginning with Italy in 1927, several countries experimented with using parachutes to drop soldiers behind enemy lines. The regular Soviet Airborne Troops were established as early as 1931 after a number of experimental military mass jumps starting from August 2, 1930. Earlier the same year, the first Soviet mass jumps led to the development of the parachuting sport in the Soviet Union. By the time of World War II, large airborne forces were trained and used in surprise attacks, as in the battles for Fort Eben-Emael and The Hague, the first large-scale, opposed landings of paratroopers in military history, by the Germans. This was followed later in the war by airborne assaults on a larger scale, such as the Battle of Crete and Operation Market Garden, the latter being the largest airborne military operation ever. Aircraft crew were routinely equipped with parachutes for emergencies as well.\n\nIn 1937, drag chutes were used in aviation for the first time, by Soviet airplanes in the Arctic that were providing support for the polar expeditions of the era, such as the first manned drifting ice station North Pole-1. The drag chute allowed airplanes to land safely on smaller ice-floes.\n\nToday's modern parachutes are classified into two categories – ascending and descending canopies. All ascending canopies refer to paragliders, built specifically to ascend and stay aloft as long as possible. Other parachutes, including ram-air non-elliptical, are classified as descending canopies by manufacturers.\n\nSome modern parachutes are classified as semi-rigid wings, which are maneuverable and can make a controlled descent to collapse on impact with the ground.\n\nRound parachutes are purely a drag device (that is, unlike the ram-air types, they provide no lift) and are used in military, emergency and cargo applications. Most have large dome-shaped canopies made from a single layer of triangular cloth gores. Some skydivers call them \"jellyfish 'chutes\" because of the resemblance to the marine organisms. Modern sports parachutists rarely use this type.\nThe first round parachutes were simple, flat circulars. These early parachutes suffered from instability caused by oscillations. A hole in the apex helped to vent some air and reduce the oscillations. Many military applications adopted conical, \"i.e.\", cone-shaped, or parabolic (a flat circular canopy with an extended skirt) shapes, such as the United States Army T-10 static-line parachute. A round parachute with no holes in it is more prone to oscillate and is not considered to be steerable. Some parachutes have inverted dome-shaped canopies. These are primarily used for dropping non-human payloads due to their faster rate of descent.\n\nForward speed (5–13  km/h) and steering can be achieved by cuts in various sections (gores) across the back, or by cutting four lines in the back thereby modifying the canopy shape to allow air to escape from the back of the canopy, providing limited forward speed. Other modifications sometimes used are cuts in various sections (gores) to cause some of the skirt to bow out. Turning is accomplished by forming the edges of the modifications, giving the parachute more speed from one side of the modification than the other. This gives the jumpers the ability to steer the parachute (such as the United States Army MC series parachutes), enabling them to avoid obstacles and to turn into the wind to minimize horizontal speed at landing.\n\nThe unique design characteristics of cruciform parachutes decrease oscillation (its user swinging back and forth) and violent turns during descent. This technology will be used by the United States Army as it replaces its older T-10 parachutes with T-11 parachutes under a program called Advanced Tactical Parachute System (ATPS). The ATPS canopy is a highly modified version of a cross/ cruciform platform and is square in appearance. The ATPS system will reduce the rate of descent by 30 percent from to . The T-11 is designed to have an average rate of descent 14% slower than the T-10D, thus resulting in lower landing injury rates for jumpers. The decline in the rate of descent will reduce the impact energy by almost 25% to lessen the potential for injury.\n\nA variation on the round parachute is the pull-down apex parachute. Invented by a Frenchman named Pierre-Marcel Lemoigne, it is called a Para-Commander canopy in some circles, after the first model of the type. It is a round parachute, but with suspension lines to the canopy apex that apply load there and pull the apex closer to the load, distorting the round shape into a somewhat flattened or lenticular shape.\n\nSome designs have the fabric removed from the apex to open a hole through which air can exit, giving the canopy an annular geometry. They also have decreased horizontal drag due to their flatter shape and, when combined with rear-facing vents, can have considerable forward speed.\n\nSport parachuting has experimented with the Rogallo wing, among other shapes and forms. These were usually an attempt to increase the forward speed and reduce the landing speed offered by the other options at the time. The ram-air parachute's development and the subsequent introduction of the sail slider to slow deployment reduced the level of experimentation in the sport parachuting community. The parachutes are also hard to build.\n\nRibbon and ring parachutes have similarities to annular designs. They are frequently designed to deploy at supersonic speeds. A conventional parachute would instantly burst upon opening and be shredded at such speeds. Ribbon parachutes have a ring-shaped canopy, often with a large hole in the centre to release the pressure. Sometimes the ring is broken into ribbons connected by ropes to leak air even more. These large leaks lower the stress on the parachute so it does not burst or shred when it opens. Ribbon parachutes made of Kevlar are used on nuclear bombs, such as the B61 and B83.\n\nRam-air parafoils are steerable, and have two layers of fabric—top and bottom—connected by airfoil-shaped fabric ribs to form \"cells\". The cells fill with higher-pressure air from vents that face forward on the leading edge of the airfoil. The fabric is shaped and the parachute lines trimmed under load such that the ballooning fabric inflates into an airfoil shape. This airfoil is sometimes maintained by use of fabric one-way valves called \"airlocks\". The first ram-air test jump was performed by United States Navy test jumper Joe Crotwell.\n\nPersonal ram-air parachutes are loosely divided into two varieties – rectangular or tapered – commonly called \"squares\" or \"ellipticals\", respectively. Medium-performance canopies (reserve-, BASE-, canopy formation-, and accuracy-type) are usually rectangular. High-performance, ram-air parachutes have a slightly tapered shape to their leading and/or trailing edges when viewed in plan form, and are known as ellipticals. Sometimes all the taper is on the leading edge (front), and sometimes in the trailing edge (tail).\n\nEllipticals are usually used only by sport parachutists. They often have smaller, more numerous fabric cells and are shallower in profile. Their canopies can be anywhere from slightly elliptical to highly elliptical, indicating the amount of taper in the canopy design, which is often an indicator of the responsiveness of the canopy to control input for a given wing loading, and of the level of experience required to pilot the canopy safely.\n\nThe rectangular parachute designs tend to look like square, inflatable air mattresses with open front ends. They are generally safer to operate because they are less prone to dive rapidly with relatively small control inputs, they are usually flown with lower wing loadings per square foot of area, and they glide more slowly. They typically have a lower glide ratio.\n\nWing loading of parachutes is measured similarly to that of aircraft, comparing exit weight to area of parachute fabric. Typical wing loading for students, accuracy competitors, and BASE jumpers is less than 5  kg per square meter – often 0.3 kilograms per square meter or less. Most student skydivers fly with wing loading below 5  kg per square meter. Most sport jumpers fly with wing loading between 5 and 7  kg per square meter, but many interested in performance landings exceed this wing loading. Professional Canopy pilots compete with wing loading of 10 to over 15 kilograms per square meter. While ram-air parachutes with wing loading higher than 20 kilograms per square meter have been landed, this is strictly the realm of professional test jumpers.\n\nSmaller parachutes tend to fly faster for the same load, and ellipticals respond faster to control input. Therefore, small, elliptical designs are often chosen by experienced canopy pilots for the thrilling flying they provide. Flying a fast elliptical requires much more skill and experience. Fast ellipticals are also considerably more dangerous to land. With high-performance elliptical canopies, nuisance malfunctions can be much more serious than with a square design, and may quickly escalate into emergencies. Flying highly loaded, elliptical canopies is a major contributing factor in many skydiving accidents, although advanced training programs are helping to reduce this danger.\n\nHigh-speed, cross-braced parachutes, such as the Velocity, VX, XAOS, and Sensei, have given birth to a new branch of sport parachuting called \"swooping.\" A race course is set up in the landing area for expert pilots to measure the distance they are able to fly past the tall entry gate. Current world records exceed .\n\nAspect ratio is another way to measure ram-air parachutes. Aspect ratios of parachutes are measured the same way as aircraft wings, by comparing span with chord. Low aspect ratio parachutes, \"i.e.\", span 1.8 times the chord, are now limited to precision landing competitions. Popular precision landing parachutes include Jalbert (now NAA) Para-Foils and John Eiff's series of Challenger Classics. While low aspect ratio parachutes tend to be extremely stable, with gentle stall characteristics, they suffer from steep glide ratios and a small tolerance, or \"sweet spot\", for timing the landing flare.\n\nBecause of their predictable opening characteristics, parachutes with a medium aspect ratio around 2.1 are widely used for reserves, BASE, and canopy formation competition. Most medium aspect ratio parachutes have seven cells.\n\nHigh aspect ratio parachutes have the flattest glide and the largest tolerance for timing the landing flare, but the least predictable openings. An aspect ratio of 2.7 is about the upper limit for parachutes. High aspect ratio canopies typically have nine or more cells. All reserve ram-air parachutes are of the square variety, because of the greater reliability, and the less-demanding handling characteristics.\n\nMain parachutes used by skydivers today are designed to open softly. Overly rapid deployment was an early problem with ram-air designs. The primary innovation that slows the deployment of a ram-air canopy is the slider; a small rectangular piece of fabric with a grommet near each corner. Four collections of lines go through the grommets to the risers (risers are strips of webbing joining the harness and the rigging lines of a parachute). During deployment, the slider slides down from the canopy to just above the risers. The slider is slowed by air resistance as it descends and reduces the rate at which the lines can spread. This reduces the speed at which the canopy can open and inflate.\n\nAt the same time, the overall design of a parachute still has a significant influence on the deployment speed. Modern sport parachutes' deployment speeds vary considerably. Most modern parachutes open comfortably, but individual skydivers may prefer harsher deployment.\n\nThe deployment process is inherently chaotic. Rapid deployments can still occur even with well-behaved canopies. On rare occasions, deployment can even be so rapid that the jumper suffers bruising, injury, or death. Reducing the amount of fabric decreases the air resistance. This can be done by making the slider smaller, inserting a mesh panel, or cutting a hole in the slider.\n\nReserve parachutes usually have a ripcord deployment system, which was first designed by Theodore Moscicki, but most modern main parachutes used by sports parachutists use a form of hand-deployed pilot chute. A ripcord system pulls a closing pin (sometimes multiple pins), which releases a spring-loaded pilot chute, and opens the container; the pilot chute is then propelled into the air stream by its spring, then uses the force generated by passing air to extract a deployment bag containing the parachute canopy, to which it is attached via a bridle. A hand-deployed pilot chute, once thrown into the air stream, pulls a closing pin on the pilot chute bridle to open the container, then the same force extracts the deployment bag. There are variations on hand-deployed pilot chutes, but the system described is the more common throw-out system.\n\nOnly the hand-deployed pilot chute may be collapsed automatically after deployment—by a kill line reducing the in-flight drag of the pilot chute on the main canopy. Reserves, on the other hand, do not retain their pilot chutes after deployment. The reserve deployment bag and pilot chute are not connected to the canopy in a reserve system. This is known as a free-bag configuration, and the components are sometimes not recovered after a reserve deployment.\n\nOccasionally, a pilot chute does not generate enough force either to pull the pin or to extract the bag. Causes may be that the pilot chute is caught in the turbulent wake of the jumper (the \"burble\"), the closing loop holding the pin is too tight, or the pilot chute is generating insufficient force. This effect is known as \"pilot chute hesitation,\" and, if it does not clear, it can lead to a total malfunction, requiring reserve deployment.\n\nParatroopers' main parachutes are usually deployed by static lines that release the parachute, yet retain the deployment bag that contains the parachute—without relying on a pilot chute for deployment. In this configuration, the deployment bag is known as a direct-bag system, in which the deployment is rapid, consistent, and reliable.\n\nA parachute is carefully folded, or \"packed\" to ensure that it will open reliably. If a parachute is not packed properly it can result in a malfunction where the main parachute fails to deploy correctly or fully. In the United States and many developed countries, emergency and reserve parachutes are packed by \"riggers\" who must be trained and certified according to legal standards. Sport skydivers are always trained to pack their own primary \"main\" parachutes.\n\nExact numbers are difficult to estimate because parachute design, maintenance, loading, packing technique and operator experience has a significant impact on malfunction rates. Approximately one in a thousand sport main parachute openings malfunctions, requiring the use of the reserve parachute, although some skydivers have many thousands of jumps and never needed to use their reserve parachute.\n\nReserve parachutes are packed and deployed somewhat differently. They are also designed more conservatively, favouring reliability over responsiveness and are built and tested to more exacting standards, making them more reliable than main parachutes. Regulated inspection intervals, coupled with significantly less use contributes to reliability as wear on some components can adversely affect reliability. The primary safety advantage of a reserve parachute comes from the probability of an unlikely main malfunction being multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction. This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction, although there is also a small possibility that a malfunctioning main parachute cannot be released and thus interfere with the reserve parachute. In the United States, the 2017 average fatality rate is recorded to be 1 in 133,571 jumps.\n\nInjuries and fatalities in sport skydiving are possible even under a fully functional main parachute, such as may occur if the skydiver makes an error in judgment while flying the canopy which results in a high-speed impact either with the ground or with a hazard on the ground, which might otherwise have been avoided, or results in collision with another skydiver under canopy.\n\nBelow are listed the malfunctions specific to round parachutes. \n\nOn August 16, 1960, Joseph Kittinger, in the Excelsior III test jump, set the previous world record for the highest parachute jump. He jumped from a balloon at an altitude of (which was also a manned balloon altitude record at the time). A small stabilizer chute deployed successfully, and Kittinger fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds, also setting a still-standing world record for the longest parachute free-fall, if falling with a stabilizer chute is counted as free-fall. At an altitude of , Kittinger opened his main chute and landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The whole descent took 13 minutes and 45 seconds. During the descent, Kittinger experienced temperatures as low as . In the free-fall stage, he reached a top speed of 614 mph (988 km/h or 274 m/s), or Mach 0.8.\n\nAccording to \"Guinness World Records\", Yevgeni Nikolayevich Andreyev (Soviet Union) held the official FAI record for the longest free-fall parachute jump (without drogue chute) after falling for 24,500 m (80,380 ft) from an altitude of 25,457 m (83,523 ft) near the city of Saratov, Russia on November 1, 1962, until broken by Felix Baumgartner in 2012.\n\nFelix Baumgartner broke Joseph Kittinger's record on October 14, 2012, with a jump from an altitude of 127,852 feet (38,969.3 m) and reaching speeds up to 833.9 mph (1,342.0 km/h or 372.8 m/s), or nearly Mach 1.1. Kittinger was an advisor for Baumgartner's jump.\n\nAlan Eustace made a jump from the stratosphere on October 24, 2014, from an altitude of 135,889.108 feet (41,419 m). However, because Eustace's jump involved a drogue parachute while Baumgartner's did not, their vertical speed and free fall distance records remain in different record categories.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "436436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436436", "title": "Scotiabank Arena", "text": "Scotiabank Arena\n\nScotiabank Arena, formerly the Air Canada Centre, is a multi-purpose arena located on Bay Street in the South Core district of Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Toronto Rock of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). In addition, the minor league Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Raptors 905 of the NBA G League play occasional games at the arena. The area was previously home to the Toronto Phantoms of the Arena Football League (AFL) during their brief existence.\n\nThe arena is owned and operated by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd. (MLSE), the same group that owns both the Leafs and Raptors, as well as their respective development teams, and is in size. In 2008, the Scotiabank Arena was the fifth busiest arena in the world and the busiest in Canada. It is also the most photographed location in Canada on Instagram according to BuzzFeed. Scotiabank Arena is connected to Toronto Union railway station, subway station and bus terminal via the PATH.\n\nScotiabank Arena has, from its initial design to completion, revolutionized many concepts included in new arenas and stadiums built since then. These features include luxury suites accessible on the ground floor, splitting the main scoreboard into several sections, rotating all sponsor signage in the bowl at once (to allow dominant messaging or \"neutralization\" for events that disallow commercial advertising), and multiple restaurants in and out of the main arena bowl view.\n\nScotiabank Arena also hosts other events, such as concerts, political conventions and video game competitions.\n\nThe arena site was once occupied by Canada Post's Toronto Postal Delivery Building (designed by Charles B. Dolphin). The Canada Post building was built in 1938, in hope that it would assist in the recent population growth of Toronto and its surrounding area. The building was briefly handed over to Department of National Defence for war storage purposes upon completion in 1941, but returned to Canada Post in 1946. Modifications were added to the Canada Post building in order for it to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered due to the Department of National Defence. After the work was completed in 1948, the building now posed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. In the early 1990s the building was in need of major renovations, so in order to cut costs Canada Post decided to close the faciliy and move operations to an alternate letter processing plant. This processing plant, which had been constructed in the 1970s, was located on Eastern Avenue and eventually all of the old building's work was transferred here. In the early 1990s, real estate developers Bramalea Ltd and Trizec arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post with equal ownership, and redevelop the site into a office, retail and residential space. The financial and development details of the purchase had various conditions around the property being rezoned by the city, and remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post before any development.\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the building ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993. The Toronto Raptors purchased the building from Canada Post the next year.\n\nConstruction of Air Canada Centre, now called Scotiabank Arena, was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman John Bitove. In 1995, it was decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and the lot size. Other venues such as Exhibition place, North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for $60 million. The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now Rogers Centre) while the arena was constructed. Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the Art Deco facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along Bay Street) and south (Lake Shore Boulevard) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing Union Station) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of facadism. The original building is protected under the \"Ontario Heritage Act\".\n\nWhile construction was in progress, the Raptors and their partially completed arena were purchased by MLSE, which was contemplating building their own arena for the Maple Leafs to replace the aging Maple Leaf Gardens. MLSE subsequently ordered major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217 million, MLSE increased the budget to $265 million after taking control. The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.\n\nIn December 1998, the building's construction was completed and the opening basketball game, hockey game and first concert took place early the next year. The opening hockey game took place February 20, 1999 (Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Montreal Canadiens), the opening basketball Game took place February 21, 1999 (Toronto Raptors vs. Vancouver Grizzlies), and the opening concert took place February 22, 1999 (The Tragically Hip). Features of the new building consist of a 65,000-square-foot arena and a 165,000-square-foot office tower. There is also east-west covered, climate controlled galleria and walkway onsite that contains restaurants, the ticket office, and other commercial units. The Galleria also connects the Scotiabank arena to popular locations in the downtown core such as Union Station, Bay street and York Street. Scotiabank Arena is connected to the underground PATH network. The Galleria also acts as a historical museum by displaying numerous artifacts from the old Canada Post building.\n\nIn its first ten years of operation, the new arena had an estimated economic benefit of $2.4 billion. This boosted Toronto's economy and led to the motivation of further construction in the downtown core. It led to many projects in the area getting completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13 million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto. These projects included the Bay West Teamway, Union Plaza, the Galleria (shopping centre), and Bremner Boulevard.\n\nAir Canada purchased naming rights to the arena for US$30 million for 20 years. \n\nIn 2003, MLSE completed a $5 million upgrade of the arena, including a new LED signage system. During the summer of 2015, a $10 million upgrade of the arena was carried out, which included the installation of a new scoreboard four times as large as the previous one. The old scoreboard was later installed at Ricoh Coliseum.\n\nIn the winter of 2003, The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario handed over a seven-day penalty to the area. This was because of the arena “permitting drunken patrons to be in the licensed patrons.” This was said to have occurred in the fall of 2002 at a Toronto Maple Leafs game and also a Rolling Stones concert. As a result of these misdemeanours, there was no alcohol to be served at the arena from December 21-28, 2003. The venue had multiple major events during this time frame which included a Toronto Raptors-Orlando Magic game on Dec. 21, a Toronto Maple Leafs-Florida Panthers game on Dec. 23, and Disney On Ice: Toy Story 2, which ran from Dec. 25-Jan. 1. \n\nOn September 6, 2014, a group of statues known as \"Legends Row\" was unveiled outside the arena at the southwest corner of the building. The statues were situated in multiple waves from 2014 to 2016 and include Ted Kennedy, Johnny Bower, Darryl Sittler, Borje Salming, Syl Apps, George Armstrong, Mats Sundin, Dave Keon, Turk Broda, and Tim Horton. In 2017, the final four statues were unveiled including Red Kelly, Frank Mahovlich, Charlie Conacher, and Wendel Clark. \"Legends Row\" now features 14 life-sized statues of former Maple Leaf players alongside a granite players' bench.\n\nOn August 29, 2017, it was announced that the Air Canada Centre would be renamed Scotiabank Arena on July 1, 2018. The landmark 20-year sponsorship agreement between Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment and Scotiabank is worth about C$800 million. This is believed to be the highest-priced annual building and team sponsorship in North American sports history. The arena is the third in Canada to bear naming rights to Scotiabank.\n\nIn late 2005, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment announced that they would be renovating the western side of the Air Canada Centre during the 2008 off-season to connect it with the Maple Leaf Square development. Maple Leaf Square is jointly owned by MLSE, Cadillac Fairview and Lantera Developments. The $500 million development includes two restaurants, Hotel Le Germain at Maple Leaf Square boutique hotel, extensive retail shopping, including a Leafs, Marlies, Raptors, and Toronto FC store, two 54-storey condominiums, a Longo's supermarket, and a public square. It opened in 2010. The two-year, $48 million renovation of the ACC added a new atrium that includes a High-Definition broadcast studio for Leafs Nation Network (formerly Leafs TV), NBA TV Canada and GolTV Canada.\n\nThe outside wall of the atrium features a video screen overlooking the plaza, which often broadcasts games taking place inside the arena. During NHL and NBA playoff runs, the square attracts thousands of Leafs and Raptors fans, respectively, sometimes broadcasting away playoff matches featuring the Leafs and/or the Raptors as well. A section of the square is designated Ford Fan Zone at Maple Leaf Square, with naming rights given to the Ford Motor Company of Canada. During Raptors playoff runs, the square has acquired the nickname \"Jurassic Park\" after the 1993 film adaptation that inspired the team's name.\n\nIn 2003, the governing Liberal Party of Canada held their leadership convention at the Air Canada Centre. Paul Martin was elected as the new leader of the party and thus also became prime minister, succeeding Jean Chrétien.\n\nThe first Maple Leafs home game took place on February 20, 1999, versus the Montreal Canadiens, won by the Leafs 3–2 on an overtime goal by Steve Thomas. Maple Leaf home games are generally sold out, and despite their lack of appearances in NHL playoffs and the Stanley Cup, there is a waitlist since the start of 2015 for Season Ticket Holders for upcoming seasons. The first Raptors game took place the following night versus the then-Vancouver Grizzlies. The Raptors won 102–87 in front of a sell-out crowd. The facility hosted the 2000 NHL All-Star Game, the championship game of the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, all games of the 2016 World Cup of Hockey and the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, the first NBA All-Star Game held outside of the United States.\n\nThe Toronto Rock also moved to the Air Canada Centre from Maple Leaf Gardens for the 2001 NLL season. The Rock's first game was a 17–7 win over the Ottawa Rebel on December 21, 2000.\n\nOn October 3, 2003, Air Canada Centre had a power outage during the third quarter of a Raptors pre-season game against the Athens-based club Panathinaikos. The game was called final, because the power was not restored in time and the Raptors already had a 30-point lead.\n\nAir Canada Centre hosted the 2015 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships for the first time, as well as hosted the final match of that tournament, in which Canada was crowned champion, defeating Russia. The ACC co-hosted that tournament with Bell Centre in Montreal, and both venues co-hosted the 2017 edition of the same event, though the ACC did not host the medal rounds.\n\nIn 2017, the Air Canada Centre hosted the opening and closing ceremonies for that year's Invictus Games.\n\nOn September 23, 2017 the ACC presented the opening ceremony as a live two-hour event spectacular. This ceremony was designed to welcome and honour the 550 competitors and their families who come from 17 different competing nations. The show featured hundreds of cast members, including honorary men and women from the Canadian Armed Forces. The cast showed a display of ceremony in multiple different productions and the raising of the flag. Other guests of the event included celebrities, world dignitaries, headline music stars and other special guests. They gathered to celebrate the service and stories of the members of the 2017 Invictus Games. Headline performers included Laura Wright, Alessia Cara, The Tenors, Sarah McLachlan, and La Bottine Souriante.\n\nThe ACC hosted the Invictus Games Toronto 2017 Closing Ceremony on September 20, 1017. The event featured an arrangement of international headline music artists, coming together to celebrate and recognize the Invictus Games competitors. The closing ceremony featured headline musical guests Bachman & Turner, Bryan Adams, Coeur de Pirate, Bruce Springsteen, and Kelly Clarkson. This celebration also included words from world dignitaries as the Games are passed to the host nation of the Invictus Games 2018, Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe arena has also played host to five Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) events.\nOn August 27 and 28, 2016, Air Canada Centre hosted the sixth season of the Summer North American Championship Series of \"League of Legends\" (LoL), marking the first professional \"League of Legends\" competition in Canada. \"League of Legends\" is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) PC game by American video game developer Riot Games; \"League of Legends\" competitions are among the most viewed among professional video game competitions worldwide. During the final round, Team SoloMid (TSM) defeated Cloud9 (C9) three matches to one in a best-of-five format. The Summer North American Championship Series serve as the qualifiers for the annual League of Legends World Championship for North American teams.\n\n"}

{"id": "771067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=771067", "title": "Tee", "text": "Tee\n\nA tee is a stand used to support a stationary ball so that the player can strike it, particularly in golf, tee ball, American football, and rugby.\n\nThe word tee is derived from the Scottish Gaelic word \"taigh\" meaning house and is related to the 'house' (the coloured circles) in curling. This would make sense, as the first golf tees were within a \"circle\" of one golf club length round the hole. Nowadays, modern courses have separate, designated tee boxes for each hole. For example, the ninth hole of a course is played from the ninth tee to the ninth green, and similarly for the other holes.\n\nIn golf, a tee is normally used for the first stroke of each hole. The area from which this first stroke is hit is in the rules known as the teeing ground. Normally, teeing the ball is allowed only on the first shot of a hole, called the tee shot, and is illegal for any other shot; however, local or seasonal rules may allow or require teeing for other shots as well, \"e.g.\", under \"winter rules\" to protect the turf when it is unusually vulnerable. Teeing gives a considerable advantage for drive shots, so it is normally done whenever allowed. However, a player may elect to play his/her tee shot without a tee. This typically gives the shot a lower trajectory.\n\nA standard golf tee is 2.125\" (two and one eighth inches = 5.4 cm) long, but both longer and shorter tees are permitted. Ordinary tees can be made from wood or from durable plastic. There are also many biodegradable, ecological and recycable golf tees that diminish the number of trees cut down to manufacture the tees and allow golf courses to lower costs by not having to deal with the broken wooden tees on their courses.\n\nAccording to the R&A rule book, for a tee to be legal, \"It must not be longer than 4 inches (101.6 mm) and it must not be designed or manufactured in such a way that it could indicate the line of play or influence the movement of the ball.\"\n\nThe development of the tee was the last major change to the rules of golf. Before this, golf balls were teed up on little heaps of sand that were provided in boxes. This explains the historical name \"tee boxes\" for what is today known as \"teeing ground\". \n\nThe earliest golf tees rested flat on the ground and had a raised portion to prop up the ball. The first patent for this kind of tee is dated 1889, and was issued to Scotsmen William Bloxsom and Arthur Douglas. The first known tee to pierce the ground was a rubber-topped peg sold commercially as the \"Perfectum.\" This was patented in 1892 by Percy Ellis of England. In 1899, an African-American dentist, Dr. George Franklin Grant, obtained a patent for an \"improved golf tee\". This tee consisted of a wood cone with a rubber sleeve to support the ball, but it is not known to have ever been marketed. \n\nThese and other variations failed to catch on, as most golfers—whether because of tradition, habit, or concerns about the rules—continued using heaps of sand. It took a strong marketing effort by Dr. William Lowell, Sr. in the 1920s to bring manufactured tees into widespread use. Sales of his \"Reddy Tee,\" a simple wooden peg with a flared top, took off after Lowell hired professional golfers Walter Hagen and Joe Kirkwood, Sr. to promote the product during exhibition matches. It was copied around the world, and remains the most common type of golf tee.\n\nTee Ball is based on baseball, with the main difference being the use of a tee in the place of a pitcher. Much larger than a golf tee, the Tee Ball tee is a rubber stand attached to the home plate which supports the baseball at a suitable height for the batter to hit. It is adjustable to allow for variations in batter height.\n\nA kicking tee is a rubber or plastic platform, often with prongs and/or a brim around an inner depression.\n\nIn American football and its variants, a tee may be used on kickoffs to raise the ball slightly above the playing surface (up to one inch, by NFL and NCAA rules). First use of the tee is attributed to Arda Bowser, a member of the Canton Bulldogs NFL championship team of 1922. The CFL and some high school leagues also allow the use of tees on field goal and extra point kicks, where another player (the holder) places one end of the ball on the tee (usually just a rubber block) and holds the opposite end.\n\nTees may also be used for place kicks in rugby league football and rugby union football.\n\nThe largest golf tee in the world was created by Jim Bolin in Casey, Illinois, USA. It measures at 9.37 m (30 ft 9 in) long with a head diameter of 1.91 m (6 ft 3 in) and a shaft width of 64 cm (2 ft 1 in).\n\n\n"}

United States, 574 U.S. ___ (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court construed 18 U.S.C. § 1519, a provision added to the federal criminal code by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to criminalize the destruction or concealment of \"any record, document, or tangible object\" to obstruct a federal investigation. By a 5-to-4 vote, the Court stated that the term \"tangible object\" as used in this section means an object used to record or preserve information, and that this did not include fish.\n\nPetitioner John L. Yates, a commercial fisherman, was operating in the Gulf of Mexico when a federal agent conducted an offshore inspection and found that the ship's catch had undersized red grouper, in violation of United States federal conservation regulations. The federal agent instructed Captain Yates to keep the undersized fish segregated; Yates instructed his crew to throw the undersized fish overboard, resulting in Yates being charged under 18 United States Code §1519. This provision, originating from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, states that a person may be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years if the person \"knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence\" a federal investigation.\n\nAt trial, Yates sought an acquittal for the §1519 charge arguing that fish were not tangible objects related to record-keeping. The District Court denied the acquittal motion. Yates was found guilty by a jury of violating §1519 and sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction, holding that fish have a physical form and are therefore a tangible object under a dictionary definition.\n\nAssociate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg authored the plurality opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, holding that \"within §1519's compass,\" a tangible object is \"one used to record or preserve information.\" Among other things, the plurality relied upon traditional canons of statutory construction including the canons \"noscitur a sociis\" (\"a word is known by the company it keeps\") and \"ejusdem generis\" (\"general words following a list of specific words should usually be read in light of those specific words\"), as well as the section's enactment as part of a statute dealing with financial fraud and its location within title 18.\n\nAssociate Justice Samuel Alito filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.\n\nAssociate Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas, dissented. Justice Kagan concluded that a tangible object is \"any object capable of being touched.\" Citing the United States Code and other U.S. laws, Kagan argued that tangible object \"invariably covers physical objects of all\nkinds\" and that the surrounding language of §1519 makes it clear that Congress \"meant the term to have a wide range.\"\n\nThe dissenting opinion suggests that the plurality opinion acknowledges that a tangible object is \"a discrete thing that possesses physical form.\" Kagan continues this line of argument by holding that a fish \"is, of course, a discrete thing that possesses physical form,\" citing Dr. Seuss's book \"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish\" (1960) as general evidence. Kagan's view is that under the \"ordinary meaning of the term,\" a tangible object in §1519 covers fish (including undersized red grouper).\n\n"}
