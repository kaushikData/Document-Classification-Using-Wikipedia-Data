It was held in Caracas, Venezuela from February 5 to February 10 at Estadio Universitario, featuring the original members of the first stage. Puerto Rico was represented by the Leones de Ponce, while the host Navegantes del Magallanes represented Venezuela. The Dominican Republic debuted in the Series and was represented by the Tigres del Licey to complete a three-team tournament. The format consisted of 12 games, with each team facing the other competitors three times. Because the series was so small, each team had to face each other in one night. \nFor the first time, Venezuela captured the competition with a record of 7-1 behind strong pitching performances by Orlando Peña (2-0, 2.00 ERA in 18.0 innings pitched), Aurelio Monteagudo (2-0, one shutout, 16 SO, 0.00 in 12 2⁄3 IP), Jay Ritchie (one-hit, nine-SO shutout), and Larry Jaster (1-0, 3.30 ERA in 16 1⁄3 IP). With Carlos Pascual as manager, 1B Gonzalo Márquez was voted Most Valuable Player after leading Series hitters with a .478 batting average (11-for-25). Other contributions came from 2B Gustavo Gil (.387, four runs, seven RBI), CF César Tovar (.349, five runs, three stolen bases), C Ray Fosse (.391, four runs), and 3B Dámaso Blanco (five runs, five RBI). Also in the roster were infielder Chico Ruiz, outfielder Jim Holt, and pitchers Don Eddy, Mike Hedlund and Luis Peñalver.\n\nThe team of Puerto Rico, with Jim Fregosi at the helm, finished second with a 4-4 mark. The pitching staff was led by Wayne Simpson, who went 2-0 with a 1.12 ERA and two complete games, including a four-hit shutout. Also in the roster were pitchers Mike Cuellar, Paul Doyle and Clyde Wright; catcher Pat Corrales; infielders José Cruz (1B), Sandy Alomar Sr. (2B), Tony Pérez (3B) and Jackie Hernández (SS), and outfielders Julio Roque (LF), Luis Meléndez (CF) and Bernie Carbo (RF). Meléndez led the Puerto Rican offensive with one home run, six runs and six RBI.\n\nDominican Republic, led by outfielder/manager Manny Mota, ended in last place with a 1-7 record. The team's only victory came behind a strong pitching effort from Reggie Cleveland, who threw nine innings of one-hit, one run ball against Puerto Rico. The team featured players as Matty Alou, Rico Carty, César Cedeño, Elvio Jiménez and Freddie Velázquez.\n\n\n\n  \n"}

It is the home of the Montana State Bobcats of the Big Sky Conference; the primary venue for men's and women's basketball and indoor track and field.\n\nThe arena regularly has numerous tournaments, concerts, plays, speaking engagements, and trade shows throughout the year; it annually hosts the high school all-class state volleyball tournament and the MSU Spring Rodeo. The Big Sky men's basketball tournament finals were played here in 1988, 1996, and 2002, and the women's in 1993.\n\nOn the south side of campus, its elevation at street level is above sea level.\n\nThe building was the inspiration of architect Oswald \"Ozzie\" Berg Jr. and Montana State College (MSC) president Roland Renne, who dreamed of an indoor facility large enough for college football games. Though there was not enough funding to build it big enough to house a full-sized football field, the fieldhouse was the largest clear-span wooden structure in the world, since surpassed by other buildings such as the Walkup Skydome in Flagstaff, Arizona, and the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington.\n\nOpened in 1957 as the MSC Fieldhouse, it was named for longtime basketball coach John \"Brick\" Breeden in 1981. The main arena was named Worthington Arena in 1985 in honor of Max Worthington, a starting guard on Montana State's 1928-29 national championship team. Both were members of the 1929 \"Golden Bobcats\" basketball team, named national champions by the Helms Foundation. Breeden later coached the Bobcats basketball team and served as athletic director, and Worthington, also a former coach, served as a school administrator and longtime booster.\n\nFrom 1959-1960, the fieldhouse hosted indoor Little League games.\n\nIn 1960, the arena drew national attention as it hosted a National Boxing Association middleweight title bout between Gene Fullmer and Joey Giardello on April 20. It was the first title fight held in Montana in 37 years, since the infamous Jack Dempsey vs. Tommy Gibbons heavyweight bout, which bankrupted the small town of Shelby in 1923. With a national television broadcast guarantee of $100,000 and a sellout attendance of 12,122, the fight, which was declared a draw, was a tremendous financial success.\nThe College National Finals Rodeo was annually held in the fieldhouse from 1970 to 1996, with the exception of 1979, when it was in Lake Charles, Louisiana. MSU's annual Spring Rodeo takes place in the arena in April.\n\nThe main floor was originally dirt, which was not uncommon for a collegiate multi-purpose field house in that era; Hec Edmundson Pavilion in Seattle long had an unfinished earthen floor. With its usage as a rodeo venue, the dirt surface in Bozeman was practical at the time.\n\nA portable raised basketball court was assembled in the center of the space and wooden boardwalks led spectators from the entrance to the concession stand and bleachers. Basketball players were obliged to wipe their feet after emerging from the dressing rooms and before stepping up to the court.\n\nIn 1980, the entire arena floor was covered with a hard tartan (polyurethane) surface and new folding bleachers were installed on the main level. Other than the new floor, the facility changed very little in its first forty years.\n\nIn 1998, a $13.2 million renovation was completed that transformed the building into a modern multi-purpose arena. A new main entrance was constructed on the south side that brings spectators into the arena at the mezzanine level. Elevators and other features were added to make the building handicapped accessible. Old bleacher and chairback seats were replaced. The building's mechanical systems were upgraded, and additional fire, life-safety, and seismic features were added to bring the building up to modern codes. The renovation also featured new administrative and coaches offices, locker room improvements, better concession stands, new reception areas, and a new Hall of Fame. The arena can be converted quickly from athletic events to concerts, to theater performances.\n\n\n"}

Reserves, Stockport County Reserves and Oldham Curzon Ladies. \n\nThe stadium formerly used Baspograss, on which Hyde United played Darlington in the 1st Round Proper in 1994, the last non-qualifying FA Cup game on an artificial surface for twenty years, until Maidstone United played Stevenage on their artificial surface in 2014. \n\nIt also hosted an American football team, the Manchester Spartans, in the 1980s after a surge in the sport's popularity in the UK following Channel 4's coverage of live NFL games. A Rugby League Super League game between Oldham and Sheffield was staged at the stadium in 1997.\n\nThe stadium holds 4,250 people, with 530 seats.\n\nEwen Fields is made up of five stands, the Main Stand, the Scrattin Shed, the Tinker's Passage End, the Leigh Street Stand and the Walker Lane End. All of the stands are covered.\n\nThe Main Stand is the only seated stand at Ewen Fields. It also houses the players' dressing rooms, board room and sponsors lounge as well as a refreshments bar and toilets.\n\nNext to the Main Stand is the Scrattin' Shed, although it is more commonly known as the Shed End, despite not actually being at the end of the ground. This is where the most vociferous home fans usually congregate. The Social Club is behind the Shed, and traverses the boundary wall. There is a door inside the ground, and one in the car park.\n\nThe Tinker's Passage End (named after the footpath which runs behind the stand) is behind the goal nearest to the Scrattin' Shed. Unusually, the stand runs at an acute angle to the goal line. This is because the pitch prior to the Astroturf was not a perfect rectangle, and the stand, which used to be parallel to the goal line, shows the extent of this previous irregularity. Away fans are housed in the Tinker's Passage End on the rare occasions that games at Ewen Fields are segregated.\n\nRunning opposite to the Main Stand and Scrattin' Shed is the Leigh Street Stand, behind the home and away dugouts where another set of home fans stand. A second refreshments bar is also on this side.\n\nThe Walker Lane End (sometimes referred to as the Baths End due to the leisure centre behind the stand) is behind the goal at the opposite end to the Tinker's Passage End. When the Astroturf was laid, and the pitch realigned, it was also lengthened at this end. As a result, the Walker Lane Stand was built afterwards, and is parallel to the goal line.\n\nIn 2010, Hyde United changed their name to Hyde F.C. and had a kit change to black and white. Ewen Fields had a make over in summer 2010, funded by Manchester City as part of the clubs' partnership. In 2015, the club reverted to being called Hyde United.\n\n"}

Groundbreaking and construction began on June 18, 2016, and the arena received its certificate of occupancy on June 5, 2018. It is the home of the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team of Marquette University. The arena opened on August 26, 2018.\n\nDespite being one of the premier NBA facilities when completed in 1988, the BMO Harris Bradley Center was one of the oldest active NBA arenas by the end of the Bucks' tenancy in 2018. Only Madison Square Garden in New York City and Oracle Arena in Oakland were older than the Bradley Center; however, both Madison Square Garden and Oracle Arena were substantially renovated during their lifetimes, although Oracle Arena is scheduled to be replaced by the new Chase Center in San Francisco in 2019. The funds for the building of the BMO Harris Bradley Center were donated by Jane Bradley Pettit and husband Lloyd Pettit without any provision for the building's long-term capital needs or annual operating expenses. Although the facility was self-sufficient, the BMO Harris Bradley Center tenants, such as the Bucks, were at a disadvantage compared with other NBA teams because of the arrangement.\n\nBuilding a new downtown arena was proposed by former Bucks owner and former U.S. Senator Herb Kohl. There was considerable discussion in the region about the idea of a publicly funded arena and ultimately no resolution was reached. In 2009, Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle included a provision in the state's capital budget seeking $5 million in state bonding support to renovate the Bradley Center. The Bradley Center's board of directors told state officials that the building needed $23 million in renovations, so they reportedly agreed to raise the remaining $18 million on their own.\n\nOn September 18, 2013, then-deputy NBA commissioner Adam Silver toured the arena and said it was a few thousand square feet short of NBA standards, and also lacked numerous amenities. On April 16, 2014, Kohl announced an agreement to sell the franchise to New York City hedge-fund investors Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens. The deal included provisions for $100 million each from Kohl and the new ownership group, for a total of $200 million, toward the construction of a new downtown arena. Soon afterward, the NBA gave the Bucks an ultimatum—get a new arena, or be close to completing a new arena, by the start of the 2017–18 season. If not, the league would buy the franchise from Lasry and Edens and sell the Bucks to one of two prospecting ownership groups; one in Las Vegas and the other in Seattle, which would have meant the certain departure of the Bucks from Milwaukee. On July 15, 2015, the Wisconsin Senate approved funding for the new arena by a 21–10 margin, and on July 28, 2015, the Wisconsin State Assembly approved funding by a 52-34 margin. On August 12, 2015, Governor Scott Walker signed the arena spending plan at Wisconsin State Fair Park in West Allis, Wisconsin.\n\nThe Milwaukee city council voted 12-3 on September 22, 2015, to approve the plan. The city's Plan Commission gave unanimous conditional approval to the Bucks' general development plans for land in the Park East Corridor on November 23, while acknowledging possible parking problems in the area.\n\nOn April 13, 2016, the Bucks signed a 30-year lease to play in the new arena. In addition Marquette University has agreed to lease the arena for its home games, beginning in 2018.\n\nThe official groundbreaking was during the 2nd annual Bucks Block Party on June 18, 2016.\n\nOn May 2, 2017, Milwaukee Bucks President Peter Feigin stated that construction of the arena remained on schedule and on budget. Feigin's announcement was from the site of the new arena, after the first roof truss was installed and bolted into place. The roof was officially topped off on August 24, 2017. On August 26, 2018, Fiserv Forum was officially opened in a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the 4th annual Bucks Block Party. The first live event at Fiserv Forum was The Killers with Violent Femmes on September 4, 2018.\n\nThe Bucks played their inaugural game at the Fiserv Forum during the preseason against the Chicago Bulls on October 3, 2018. They won the game 116–82. Their regular season home opener was played on October 19, 2018, against the Indiana Pacers. The Bucks won, 118-101.\n\nLocal companies including Johnson Controls, Miller Brewing, Harley-Davidson, and BMO Harris Bank have agreed to be partners with the Bucks, but not for naming rights. On July 26, 2018, the Bucks agreed to a 25-year naming rights deal with Fiserv.\n\nAfter the official name was announced, fans nicknamed the building the \"Four-One-Forum\", a reference to the city's area code.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks released the first images and details of their vision for the development of a new multi-purpose arena and sports and entertainment district to revitalize downtown Milwaukee on April 8, 2015. The images depicted early conceptual drawings of a new multi-purpose venue and entertainment district that will anchor a new development vision activated by sports, entertainment, residential and office uses. The site, which primarily sits between 4th Street and 6th Street from State Street to McKinley Avenue, will seamlessly link with active development on all sides, including Old World Third Street, Schlitz Park, The Brewery, the Milwaukee riverfront, Water Street and the Wisconsin Center.\n\nPopulous and HNTB, two firms from Kansas City, lead the arena design team with participation from Milwaukee firm Eppstein Uhen. The arena is intended to be the focal point of a \"live block\" zone that includes public space surrounded by both commercial and residential development. Initial renderings of the arena showed a transparent facade and a curved roof and side meant to evoke the water forms of nearby Lake Michigan and the Milwaukee River.\n\nFiserv Forum holds 17,500 people and has fewer luxury suites, but more club seating than the BMO Harris Bradley Center.\n\nIt also features a layout and equipment for an NHL/NCAA-regulation ice hockey rink and ice shows such as \"Disney on Ice\", thus it still will be able to host the NCAA Frozen Four as the BMO Harris Bradley Center did in the past in 1993, 1997 and 2006. However, the American Hockey League's Milwaukee Admirals returned to the UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena in the 2016-17 season as they were not approached to play games in the arena. The Bucks are contractually bound not to recruit current tenants of the Panther Arena to move their events to the Fiserv Forum.\n\nFiserv Forum has the largest symmetric scoreboard in the NBA.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3102587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3102587", "title": "Frontenis", "text": "Frontenis\n\nFrontenis is a sport that is played in a 30 meter pelota court using racquets (a tennis racquet or a similar frontenis racquet) and rubber balls. It can be played in pairs or singles, but only pairs frontenis is played in international competitions. This sport was developed in Mexico around 1900, and is accredited as a Basque pelota speciality.\n\nIn frontenis, one player of the pair hits the ball with the racquet toward the front wall. The ball must strike the playable surface of the front wall and return to the playable area of the court. The opposing players must strike the ball before it bounces a second time on the floor of the court. As with other racquet sports, the best stroke is one that the opponent cannot return. Frontenis demands having a great mobility, skill, physical agility, mental agility, coordination and training.\n\nFor many years, frontenis was played only in Mexico, Spain, Argentina, and a few other countries, but now it is played in approximately eighteen countries worldwide.\n\nFrontenis was created in Mexico in 1900. Several famous tennis players (Buttlin, Sharp, Crowle, Pérez Verdia, Maldonado, Clifford, etc.) started playing with rackets and a tennis ball hitting it against a wall. This new game, with its first modern pelota court, built in Fernando Torreblanca’s house (Mexico), was called “frontontenis” (from \"fronton\" and \"tenis\" — “pelota court” and “tennis” in Spanish, respectively), and later its name was reduced to “frontenis”.\n\nBecause of the increase of the number of pelota players, pelota courts proliferated, and frontenis expanded from Mexico to neighboring countries and later to Europe. Frontenis was introduced into the Iberian Peninsula in the 1940s by way of the Canary Islands. In the 1960s, Olympic ball was introduced in Mexico, and many Mexican players travelled to Spain to teach the technique. The game and all its innovations were taken from Spain to the other countries of Europe.\n\nEvery European country that plays pelota is member of the Union of European Basque Pelota Federations (UEBPF), and all the countries that play Basque pelota are members of the International Federation of Basque Pelota (IFBP).\n\nFrontenis (recognized by the IFBP) started being played in international competitions in 1952, with the First World Championship held in Donostia-San Sebastian (Spain).\n\nFrontenis has its own rules, like every sport. There are international rules, national rules and territorial rules, and they differ from each other in several things.\n\nThe court used in frontenis is a pelota court of the Very Short type — 30 meters long, 10 meters wide and 10 meters high. Its walls must have signs to establish the distances of service, and to help the player to situate itself in the court. There are several parts that form the court:\n\nThis is the wall at the front of the court faced by the players. Every ball hit by a player must strike this wall before touching the ground to be valid. The front wall measures 10 meters wide by 10 meters high. The lower 60 centimeters of this wall is not a legally playable surface. The upper limit of this non-playable surface is covered with a 10-centimeter-wide metallic sheet (\"chapa\" in Spanish, \"txapa\" in Basque) that audibly indicates an impact on the upper part of the non-playable surface.\n\nThe wall is to the players' left as they face the front wall. It is marked with lines every 3.5 meters, measured from the front of the court. On its upper rim is located a 10 centimeter wide metallic sheet that signals a ball striking outside of the playable area. This wall with its markings helps players situate themselves within the court.\n\nIt is the wall situated in the back of the court. It has no markings and is the same size as the front wall. It has 10 centimeter metallic sheets on its rims to give an audible indication of a ball striking outside of the playable area. Many pelota courts lack this wall, and are therefore not used for official competitions.\n\nThe racquet used in frontenis is, according to Spanish Pelota Federation (SPF), “similar or equal to tennis racquets, made of wood, fiber, metal or graphite. Weight and stringing are not limited, and double strings can be used. The racquets' length and width are not limited.”\n\nRacquets have evolved considerably since the beginning of professional frontenis in 1900. Much of this evolution has paralleled standard tennis racquets\n\nAt first, racquets were made of wood and the strings were made of animal gut. These were very heavy and did not provide comfortable play, but they were used for more than thirty years until the great player Jose, the “Poison” Becerra revolutionized the sport. Manufacturers that made tennis products started to manufacture parallel products for frontenis when Becerra started to win championships. In the 1990s a Mexican company, “Master Pro”, was created exclusively to manufacture frontenis products. Recently, other companies have appeared specializing in frontenis equipment.\n\nSimple strings is used in Preolympic frontenis, and the tension varies depending on the ball — Penn strings require 15-19 kilos, VIP strings require 17-21 kilos, and Champion Elite strings requie 17-23 kilos. Double strings (duplication of 4 horizontal strings and 3 vertical strings) are used in Olympic frontenis in order to give more effect to the ball. Double stringing demands higher tensions, between 21 and 27 kilos.\n\nThe ball in Olympic frontenis (the only modality accepted by the IFBP) is the Olympic ball.\n\nOriginally, the sport was played with ordinary tennis balls, but the fiber cover of these balls slowed them excessively, reduced their bounce, and made the game very slow. To speed the game, the fabric cover of the tennis balls was removed. Later, balls made of oilcloth were imported from England and the United States with the goal of further speeding the game.\n\nDuring the Second World War, ball imports ceased, and Francisco Beltran was forced to look for substitutes. He experimented with pressurizing rubber balls. After the Second World War, Beltran started manufacturing improved balls.\n\nA few years later the first frontenis ball company, “201”, was founded by Francisco Beltran who contributed his ball designs and Doctor Jesus Ledezma who provided financing. Ball design continues to evolve.\n"}

{"id": "21014798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21014798", "title": "History of wrestling", "text": "History of wrestling\n\nWrestling and grappling sports have a long and complicated history, stretching into prehistoric times. \nMany traditional forms survive, grouped under the term folk wrestling. \nMore formal systems have been codified in various forms of martial arts worldwide, where grappling techniques form a significant subset of unarmed fighting (complemented by striking techniques).\n\nThe modern history of wrestling begins with a rise of popularity in the 19th century, which led to the development of the modern sports of Greco-Roman wrestling on the European continent and of freestyle wrestling and collegiate wrestling in Great Britain and the United States, respectively. \nThese sports enjoyed enormous popularity at the turning of the 20th century. In the 1920s, show wrestling as a form of sports entertainment, now known as professional wrestling, separated from competitive sport wrestling, now known as amateur wrestling.\n\nWrestling as a type of mock combat and display behaviour among males has anthropological roots, and is also seen in non-human Great Apes. \nIts documented history however necessarily begins with the history of pictorial representations. Cave paintings in the Bayankhongor Province of Mongolia dating back to Neolithic age of 7000 BC show grappling of two naked men and surrounded by crowds. \nIn the Ancient Near East, forms of belt wrestling were popular from earliest times. A carving on a stone slabe showing three pairs of wrestlers was dated to around 3000 BC. A cast Bronze figurine, (perhaps the base of a vase) has been found at Khafaji in Iraq that shows two figures in a wrestling hold that dates to around 2600 BC. The statue is one of the earliest depictions of sport and is housed in the National Museum of Iraq.\nPortrayal of martial arts sporting in Egypt has begun by the time of the 5th Dynasty mastaba tombs at Saqqara, circa 2400 BC. After a boat joust scene recorded in the tomb of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep, who were manicurists to King Nyuserre, six pairs of boys wrestle in the nearby tomb of Akhethotep and Ptahhotep. Another early piece of evidence for wrestling in Egypt appears at 11th and 12th Dynasty Beni Hasan (2000 BC, images at right and above), where wrestling scenes in several tombs are elaborated to cover much of a wall. During the period of the New Kingdom (1550-1070 BC), additional Egyptian artwork (often on friezes), depicted Egyptian and Nubian wrestlers competing. Carroll notes striking similarities between these ancient depictions and those of the modern Nuba wrestlers. On the 406 wrestling pairs found in the Middle Kingdom tombs at Beni Hasan in the Nile valley, nearly all of the techniques seen in modern freestyle wrestling could be found.\n\nTextual description of wrestling begins with the ancient classics, especially the Greek and Sanskrit epics. The Mahabharata describes the encounter between the accomplished wrestlers Bhima and Jarasandha.\nShuai Jiao is a legendary wrestling style of Chinese antiquity used by the Yellow Emperor during his fight against the rebel Chih Yiu. This early style of combat was first called \"jiao ti\" (butting with horns).\n\nGreek wrestling was a popular form of martial art in which points were awarded for touching a competitor's back to the ground, forcing a competitor out of bounds (arena). Three falls determined the winner. It was at least featured as a sport since the eighteenth Olympiad in 704 BC. Wrestling is described in the earliest celebrated works of Greek literature, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Wrestlers were also depicted in action on many vases, sculptures, and coins, as well as in other literature. Other cultures featured wrestling at royal or religious celebrations, but the ancient Greeks structured their style of wrestling as part of a tournament where a single winner emerged from a pool of competitors. Late Greek tradition also stated that Plato was known for wrestling in the Isthmian games.\n\nThis continued into the Hellenistic period. Ptolemy II and Ptolemy III of Egypt were both depicted in art as victorious wrestlers. After the Roman conquest of the Greeks, Greek wrestling was absorbed by the Roman culture and became Roman Wrestling during the period of the Roman Empire (510 BC to AD 500). By the eighth century, the Byzantine emperor Basil I, according to court historians, won in wrestling against a boastful wrestler from Bulgaria.\n\nGlíma is the name of the Scandinavian martial art used by the Vikings. The word glíma in Old Norse means glimpse or flash, which describes the systems techniques. Glima as a sport covers several types of Scandinavian folk wrestling: Lausatök, Hryggspenna, and Brokartök. Glima was the most widespread sport in the Viking Age (800AD-c. 1050), and was practiced by men and women of all ages. Wherever Vikings gathered, Glima was a big part of the entertainment. Glima was so important for Viking society that their most popular god, Thor, was also the Viking god of wrestling. \"Glima\" is first mentioned in 9th century Viking poetry about the Norse god Thor and his journey to Utgards-Loki, where Elli defeats Thor in a wrestling match. Glima in Iceland is almost unchanged since Viking times. The original Norwegian settlers in Iceland took Viking wrestling and the Glima combat systems with them, according to the Jónsbók law book from 1325, and the book of laws known as Grágás, which refers to a collection of earlier Norwegian laws with rules for Viking wrestling.\n\nThere is ample evidence of wrestling practiced throughout medieval Europe, both by the nobility and the lower classes. \nWrestling remained popular during the Renaissance, and for much of the 16th century.\nIn 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold pageant, Francis I of France threw Henry VIII of England in a wrestling shoes match. \nIn Henry VIII's kingdom, wrestling in many places was widely popular and had a long history.\n\nThe German tradition has records of a number of master-\"Ringer\" of the 15th to 16th centuries specializing in unarmed combat. Unarmed combat was divided in two categories, sportive grappling or \"geselliges ringen\" and serious unarmed combat or \"kampfringen\" (where \"kampf\" is the Early Modern German term for \"duel\").\nWhile sportive grappling had fixed rules that prohibited dangerous techniques, usually starting in grappling hold and ending with a throw or submission,\n\"kampfringen\" can be considered a system of unarmed self-defense including punches, joint-locks, elbow strikes, chokeholds, headbutts and (to a limited extent) kicks.\n\nOne of the primary men to have shaped kampfringen at the dawning of the German Renaissance appears to have been Austrian master Ott Jud. He is said to have developed a system of grappling to be used in combat, including joint breaks, arm locks and throws designed to cause serious injury. No treatise from Ott's own hand has survived, but his system is taught by several fencing masters of the later 15th century.\nPaulus Kal counts him among the \"society of Liechtenauer\", saying that he was wrestling teacher to the \"lords of Austria\". (possibly under Frederick III).\nOther treatises that contain material both on \"ringen\" and on swordsmanship include those of Fiore dei Liberi (c. 1410), Fabian von Auerswald (1462), Pietro Monte (c. 1480), and Hans Wurm (c. 1500).\n\nIt was only with the beginning Early Modern period, specifically the more \"dignified\" code of behaviour the upper classes imposed on themselves in the Baroque period that wrestling was abandoned by European nobility, and it became a pastime of rural populations, developing into the various surviving forms of European folk wrestling. \nA late treatise on \"ringen\" is that by Johann Georg Passchen, published in 1659. Maybe the last book which deals with Ringen as a deadly martial art, is possibly \"Leib-beschirmende und Feinden Trotz-bietende Fecht-Kunst\" from Johann Andreas Schmidt, which was published in Weigel, Nürnberg in 1713.\n\nMany of the world's oldest depictions of wrestling can be found in the Middle East. Carvings and statues show that forms of belt wrestling existed in the region since ancient times, in addition to matches between humans and animals. Wrestling is also mentioned in the epics of Gilgamesh and the Shahnameh. Oil wrestling as practiced in present-day Turkey and Central Asia is recorded in ancient Sumeria and Babylon. In Persia, Pahlavani traditional grappling or koshti (کشتی) was practiced by both the upper and lower classes both for sport and as training for battle. In training halls known as \"zourkhaneh\", soldiers practiced resistance exercises and grappling in a tradition now called varzesh-e bastani (ورزش باستانی; lit. \"ancient athletics\"). Ancient Iranian combat-wrestling (\"koshti-ye jangi\") included not only grabs but also punches and low kicks. As Iranian influence spread with the Achaemenid Empire and later the Persian Empire, the practice was adopted in the Indian subcontient as pehlwani.\n\nClassical Chinese wrestling or \"jiao li\" (角力) was a public sport in the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC) held for court amusement as well as for recruiting the best fighters. Competitors wrestled each other on a raised platform called a lei tai. The term \"shuai jiao\" was chosen by the Central Guoshu Academy of Nanjing in 1928 when competition rules began to be standardized.\n\nWrestling in the Indian subcontinent was differentiated into four types that progressed from sport (\"malakride\") to combat (\"malla-yuddha\"). Mughal conquerors introduced more groundwork and referred to their grappling style as kusti. Competitors still wrestle as in ancient times, on dirt floors while wearing only kowpeenam or loincloth.\n\nThe term \"jūjutsu\" was coined in the 17th century, after which time it became a blanket term for a wide variety of grappling-related disciplines in Japanese martial arts. Prior to that time, these skills had names such as , , , , , , and even the (as early as 1724, almost two centuries before Kanō Jigorō founded the modern art of Kodokan Judo).\nThe systems of unarmed combat that were developed and practiced during the Muromachi period (before 1573) are today referred to collectively as .\n\nThe Lancashire style of folk wrestling may have formed the basis for Catch wrestling also known as \"catch as catch can.\" \nThe Scots later formed a variant of this style, and the Irish developed the \"collar-and-elbow\" style which later found its way into the United States.\n\nWrestling as a modern sport developed in the 19th century out of traditions of folk wrestling, emerging in the form of two styles of regulated competitive sport, \"freestyle\" and \"Greco-Roman\" wrestling (based on British and continental tradition, respectively), now summarized under the term \"amateur wrestling\" by the beginning of the modern Olympics.\n\nA tradition of combining wrestling and showmanship originates in 1830s France, when showmen presented wrestlers under names such as “Edward, the steel eater”, “Gustave d’Avignon, the bone wrecker”, or “Bonnet, the ox of the low Alps” and challenged members of the public to knock them down for 500 francs. \nIn 1848, French showman, Jean Exbroyat formed the first modern wrestlers’ circus troupe and established a rule not to execute holds below the waist — a style he named \"flat hand wrestling\". This new style soon spread to the rest of Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Italy, Denmark and Russia under the names of Greco-Roman wrestling, Classic wrestling or French wrestling.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, this modern \"Greco-Roman\" wrestling style went on to become the most in fashionable sport in Europe. Because of that and the rise of gymnasiums and athletic clubs, Greco-Roman wrestling and modern freestyle wrestling were soon regulated in formal competitions. On continental Europe, prize money was offered in large sums to the winners of Greco-Roman tournaments, and freestyle wrestling spread rapidly in the United Kingdom and in the United States.\nA \"Golden Age\" for the sport followed, cut short with the breakout of World War I in 1914.\nIn 1898 the Frenchman Paul Pons, “the Colossus” became the first Professional World Champion.\nLeading wrestlers during this time, such as Georg Hackenschmidt, Stanislaus Zbyszko, William Muldoon, Frank Gotch, Constant Lavaux, had the status of popular heroes.\n\nIn the United States, wrestling was dominated by Martin \"Farmer\" Burns and his pupil, Frank Gotch. Burns was renowned as a competitive wrestler, who, despite never weighing more than 160 pounds during his wrestling career, fought over 6,000 wrestlers (at a time when most were competitive contests) and lost fewer than 10 of them. He also gained a reputation for training some of the best wrestlers of the era, including Gotch, known as one of America's first sports superstars. Gotch, regarded as \"peerless\" at his peak, was the first to actually claim the world's undisputed heavyweight championship by beating all contenders in North America and Europe. He became the world's champion by beating European wrestling champion Georg Hackenschmidt, both in 1908 and 1911, seen by modern wrestling historians as two of the most significant matches in wrestling history.\n\nProfessional wrestlers during this time would participate both in sportive competition and in shows focusing more on spectacle and entertainment, as wrestling was introduced to the public as part of a variety act to spice up the limited action involved in the bodybuilder strongman attractions. One of its earliest stars was a Cornish-American ex-miner named Jack Carkeek, who would challenge audience members to last 10 minutes with him. It is in this period that the origin between the later division between \"professional wrestling\" (non-competitive acrobatics and showmanship) and \"amateur wrestling\" (competitive) originates. \nGeorg Hackenschmidt, world champion after his 1905 win over Tom Jenkins, associated himself with British promoter and entrepreneur Charles B. Cochran. Hackenschmidt took a series of bookings in Manchester for a then-impressive £150 a week. Noting Hackenschmidt's dominant style of wrestling threatened to kill crowd interest, Cochran persuaded Hackenschmidt to learn showmanship from Cannon and wrestle many of his matches for entertainment rather than sport; this displayed the future elements of sports entertainment.\n\nThe separation of \"worked\", i.e. purely performative, choreographed wrestling from competitive sport begins in the 1920s.\nThe success of the more worked aspects of professional wrestling in America, like gimmickry and submission holds, were introduced to British wrestling. Amateur wrestler, Sir Atholl Oakley got together with fellow grappler Henry Irslinger to launch one of the first promotions to employ the new style of wrestling which was coined \"All-in wrestling\". The great demand for wrestling meant there were not enough skilled amateurs to go around, and many promoters switched to more violent styles, with weapons and chairshots part of the proceedings. Women wrestlers and mud-filled rings also became commonplace. In the late 1930s, the London County Council banned professional wrestling.\n\nWhen the First Modern Olympic Games held in Athens in 1896, Greco-Roman wrestling was introduced as an Olympic discipline. After not being featured in the 1900 Olympics, sports wrestling was seen again in 1904 in St. Louis; this time in freestyle competition. Since then, Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling have both been featured (with women's freestyle added in the Summer Olympics of 2004).\n\nThe popularity of wrestling experienced a dramatic decline in 1915 to 1920, north due to the World War, and as its reputation had suffered especially among the American public because of widespread doubt of its legitimacy and status as a competitive sport.\n\nFollowing the retirement of Frank Gotch, professional wrestling in the United States (except in the Midwest) was losing popularity fast. In response, three professional wrestlers, Ed Lewis, Billy Sandow, and Toots Mondt, joined to form their own promotion in the 1920s, modifying their in-ring product to attract fans. The three were referred to as the \"Gold Dust Trio\" due to their financial success. \nThis marks the beginning of \"professional wrestling\" as an entertainment industry separate from competitive wrestling, and to a revival of public interest in wrestling in the interwar period.\nWrestling did not, however, rise to its pre-war level of popularity again, being eclipsed by Boxing, which sport now experienced its own Golden Age.\n\nSince 1921, the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) has regulated amateur wrestling as an athletic discipline.\nIn 1927, Dr. Raymond G. Clapp published the rules for collegiate wrestling, and the next year, the first NCAA Wrestling Team Championship took place on March 30 to March 31 on the campus of Iowa State College. The rules of collegiate wrestling marked a sharp contrast to the freestyle wrestling rules of the International Amateur Wrestling Federation (IAWF) and the AAU. From then on, collegiate wrestling emerged as a distinctly American sport. College and high school wrestling grew especially after the standardization of the NCAA wrestling rules, which applied early on to both collegiate and scholastic wrestling (with high school modifications). More colleges, universities, and junior colleges began offering dual meets and tournaments, including championships and having organized wrestling seasons. There were breaks in wrestling seasons because of World War II, but in the high schools especially, state association wrestling championships sprung up in different regions throughout the 1930s and 1940s. As amateur wrestling grew after World War II, various collegiate athletic conferences also increased the number and quality of their wrestling competition, with more wrestlers making the progression of wrestling in high school, being recruited by college coaches, and then entering the collegiate competition.\nBoth freestyle wrestling and its American counterpart, collegiate wrestling, did not have a scoring system that decided matches in the absence of a fall until the introduction of a point system by Oklahoma State University wrestling coach Art Griffith that gained acceptance in 1941, and influenced the international styles as well. By the 1960s international wrestling matches in Greco-Roman and freestyle were scored by a panel of three judges in secret, who made the final decision by raising colored paddles at the match's end. Dr. Albert de Ferrari from San Francisco who became vice president of FILA, lobbied for a visible scoring system and a rule for \"controlled fall\", which would recognize a fall only when the offensive wrestler had done something to cause it. These were soon adopted internationally in Greco-Roman and freestyle.\n\n"}

{"id": "332305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332305", "title": "Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum", "text": "Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum\n\nThe Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, often referred to as the Oakland Coliseum, is a multi-purpose stadium in Oakland, California, United States, which is home to both the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). It opened in 1966 and is the only remaining stadium in the United States that is shared by professional football and baseball teams. The Coliseum was also home to some games of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer in 2008–2009 and hosted games at the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum complex consists of the stadium and the neighboring Oracle Arena.\n\nThe Coliseum has 6,300 club seats, 2,700 of which are available for Athletics games, 143 luxury suites, 125 of which are available for Athletics games, and a variable seating capacity of 47,170 for baseball, 56,057 for football, and 63,132 for soccer. In seating capacity, Oakland Coliseum is the second smallest NFL stadium, larger only than StubHub Center, the temporary home of the Los Angeles Chargers, but the eighth largest MLB stadium.\n\nOn April 3, 2017, Opening Day, the Athletics dedicated the Coliseum's playing surface as Rickey Henderson Field in honor of MLB Hall of Famer and former Athletic Rickey Henderson.\n\nThe Coliseum features an underground design where the playing surface is actually below ground level (21 feet/6 meters below sea level). Consequently, fans entering the stadium find themselves walking on to the main concourse of the stadium at the top of the first level of seats. This, combined with the hill that was built around the stadium to create the upper concourse, means that only the third deck is visible from outside the park. This gives the Coliseum the illusion of being a short stadium from the outside.\n\nBusiness and political leaders in Oakland had long been in competition with neighbor San Francisco, as well as other cities in the West, and worked for Oakland and its suburbs (the greater East Bay) to be recognized nationally as a viable metropolitan area with its own identity and reputation, distinct and separate from that of San Francisco. Professional sports was seen as a primary way for the East Bay to gain such recognition. As a result, the desire for a major-league caliber stadium in the city of Oakland intensified during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nBy 1960, a non-profit corporation was formed to oversee the financing and development of the facility (rather than city or county government issuing taxpayer-backed bonds for construction). Local real estate developer Robert T. Nahas headed this group (which included other prominent East Bay business leaders such as former US Senator William Knowland and Edgar F. Kaiser), which later became the governing board of the Coliseum upon completion. It was Nahas' idea that the Coliseum be privately financed with ownership transferring to the city and county upon retirement of the construction financing.\n\nRobert T. Nahas served 20 years as President of the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Board. On the death of Nahas, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\"'s Rick DelVecchio quoted Jack Maltester, a former San Leandro mayor and Coliseum board member, \"If not for Bob Nahas, there would be no Coliseum, it's really that simple.\" Nahas had to be a diplomat dealing with the egos of Raiders owner Al Davis, Athletics owner Charles O. Finley, and Warriors owner Franklin Mieuli.\n\nPreliminary architectural plans were unveiled in November 1960, and the following month a site was chosen west of the Elmhurst district of East Oakland alongside the then-recently completed Nimitz Freeway. A downtown site adjacent to Lake Merritt and the Oakland Auditorium (which itself, many years later, would be renamed the Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center) was also originally considered. The Port of Oakland played a key role in the East Oakland site selection; The Port swapped at the head of San Leandro Bay to the East Bay Regional Park District, in exchange for of park land across the freeway, which the Port in turn donated to the City of Oakland as the site for the Coliseum sports complex.\n\nThe Oakland Raiders of the American Football League moved to Frank Youell Field, a makeshift stadium near downtown Oakland, in 1962, and the Coliseum was already being heralded in the local media as the Raiders' future permanent home. Baseball was also a major factor in the planning of the Coliseum. As early as , the American League publicly indicated that it wished to include Oakland in its West Coast expansion plans. In , American League president Joe Cronin suggested that Coliseum officials model some aspects of the new ballpark after then-new Dodger Stadium, which impressed him, though these expansion plans seemed to fade by the middle of the decade.\n\nAfter approval from the city of Oakland as well as Alameda County by 1962, $25 million in financing was arranged. Plans were drawn for a stadium, an indoor arena, and an exhibition hall in between them. The architect of record was the San Francisco office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (with Myron Goldsmith the principal design architect) and the general contractor was Guy F. Atkinson Company. Preliminary site preparation began in the summer of 1961. Construction began in the spring of 1962. The construction schedule was delayed for two years due to various legal issues and cost overruns; the original design of the Coliseum had to be modified slightly in order to stay on budget. (For details on the indoor arena, now known as Oracle Arena, refer to that facility's article.)\n\nIn , it was rumored that the Cleveland Indians might leave Cleveland for a West Coast city (such as Oakland), but the Indians ended up remaining in Cleveland. Charlie Finley, owner of the Kansas City Athletics, unhappy in Kansas City, impressed by Oakland's new stadium and personally convinced to consider Oakland by Nahas, eventually got permission after several unsuccessful attempts and amid considerable controversy, to relocate his American League franchise to the stadium for the season (for details on the controversy, see the separate articles for the A's and the Kansas City Royals, the expansion franchise created to replace the A's in Kansas City).\n\nIn its baseball configuration, the Coliseum has the most foul territory of any ballpark in Major League Baseball. Thus, many balls that would reach the seats in other ballparks can be caught for outs at the Coliseum. The distance to the backstop was initially , but was reduced to in 1969.\n\nFrom 1968 through 1981 and in 1995, two football configurations were used at the stadium. During Raider preseason games and all regular season games played while the baseball season was still going on, the field was set up from home plate to center field (east/west). Seats that were down the foul lines for baseball games became the sideline seats for football games, which started up to 120 feet away from the field (most football-only stadiums have sideline seats that start around 60 feet away). Once the A's season ended, the orientation was switched to north/south: i.e. the football field ran from the left field line to the right field line; seats were moved from behind first and third base to create corners for the end zone to fit into (these seats were then placed to fill in the space that was normally behind home plate and near the foul poles for baseball games). Temporary football bleachers were then added in front of the baseball bleachers to form the sideline on the east (visitors') side, and the baseball bleachers were not sold. Raiders season ticket holders would thus have two season ticket locations in different parts of the stadium that roughly corresponded to the same location in relation to the field. Since stadium expansion in 1996, the field has run north/south throughout the season.\n\nFor more than its first three decades (1966–1998) the stadium was known as Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum.\n\nIn September 1997, UMAX Technologies agreed to acquire the naming rights to the stadium. However, following a dispute, a court decision reinstated the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum name. In 1998, Network Associates agreed to pay US$5.8 million over 5 years for the naming rights and the stadium became known as Network Associates Coliseum, or, alternately in marketing and media usage as, \"the Net\".\n\nNetwork Associates renewed the contract in 2003 for an additional five years at a cost of $6 million. In mid-2004, Network Associates was renamed McAfee, restoring its name from before its 1997 merger with Network General, and the stadium was renamed McAfee Coliseum accordingly.\n\nMcAfee was offered a renewal of the naming contract in 2008, but it was declined. The name reverted to the pre-1997 name of Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum on September 19, 2008. The stadium retained its original name until April 27, 2011, when it was renamed Overstock.com Coliseum via a 6-year, $7.2 million naming rights deal with online retailer Overstock.com.\n\nThe Coliseum was renamed O.co Coliseum on June 6, 2011, after Overstock.com's marketing name. However, due to a contract dispute with the Athletics regarding the Overstock/O.co naming rights deal, the A's continued to refer to the stadium as the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum in all official team communications and on team websites.\n\nOverstock opted out of the final year on their naming rights deal on April 2, 2016, and the stadium once again became the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum.\n\nThe Athletics dedicated the Coliseum's playing surface \"Rickey Henderson Field\" in honor of MLB Hall of Famer and former Athletic Rickey Henderson as part of Opening Day on April 3, 2017.\n\nThe A's then-new owner Lewis Wolff made the A's first official proposal for a new ballpark in Oakland to the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority on August 12, 2005. The new stadium would have been located across 66th Avenue from the Coliseum in what is currently an industrial area north of the Coliseum. The park would have held 35,000 fans, making it the smallest park in the major leagues. Plans for the Oakland location fell through in early 2006 when several of the owners of the land proposed for the new ballpark decided not to sell.\nThroughout 2006, the Athletics continued to search for a ballpark site within their designated territory of Alameda County. Late in 2006, rumors began to circulate regarding a parcel of land in Fremont being the new site. These rumors were confirmed by the Fremont city council on November 8 of that year. Wolff met with the council that day to present his plan to move the A's to Fremont into a soon to be built ballpark named Cisco Field. Wolff and Cisco Systems conducted a press conference at the San Jose-based headquarters of Cisco Systems on November 14, 2006 to confirm the deal, and showcase some details of the future plan. However, on February 24, 2009, after delays and increased public opposition, the Athletics officially ended their search for a stadium site in Fremont. The Athletics later took their Cisco Field plan to a site in downtown San Jose located near SAP Center (home of the NHL's San Jose Sharks). The San Jose plan was opposed by the San Francisco Giants whose territory San Jose is in and on October 5, 2015, the United States Supreme Court rejected San Jose's bid on the Athletics.\n\nDuring that time, the City of Oakland continued to propose new ballpark ideas that ranged from a proposal to build on a waterfront site in the Jack London Square area called Victory Court to a three stadium proposal called \"Coliseum City\" on the Coliseum site. Both plans went nowhere. \n\nThe Athletics signed a 10-year lease to stay in Oakland and at the Coliseum on July 22, 2014. The deal required that the team look into a new stadium, but only in the city limits, which made it more difficult for the Raiders to tear the Coliseum down for a football-only facility. The A's began talks with an architect on August 6, 2014, to build a baseball-only stadium at the Coliseum site, according to Wolff. \n\nGoing into 2016, John J. Fisher took majority control of the team and made Dave Kaval team president and the person in charge of the stadium hunt. On September 12, 2017, it was announced that a site near Laney College and the Eastlake neighborhood had been chosen for the new ballpark (tentatively called Oakland Ballpark) with the A’s proposing to construct a 35,000 seat stadium on the site of the college's administrative buildings which the A's would relocate to a spot of the college's choosing. However, the Laney College Board of Trustees abruptly ended talks with the Athletics in December, 2017. The surprised A's were forced to look at alternatives for a new stadium location. \n\nOn November 28, 2018, The Athletics announced that the team had chosen to build it's 34,000 seat new ballpark at the Howard Terminal site at the Port of Oakland. The team also announced it's intent to purchase the coliseum site and make the site into a tech and housing hub, preserving Oracle Arena and reducing the Coliseum to a low-rise sports park as San Francisco did with Kezar Stadium.\n\nUnder any such replacement proposals, the Oakland Raiders would have presumably continued to play football in the Coliseum, although there were proposals for the Raiders to play at Levi's Stadium, the home of the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara as well as rumors regarding the Raiders' possible return to Los Angeles.\n\nThe Raiders proposed a 50,000-seat stadium in the same spot of the Coliseum in 2013. It would have cost $800 million, with $300 million coming from the Raiders, $200 million coming from the NFL's stadium loan program, and the final $300 million coming from the city..\n\nAfter the failure of the stadium plan, Raiders owner Mark Davis met with officials with the city of San Antonio on July 29, 2014, to discuss moving the Raiders to the city in time for the 2015 season; they would have temporarily played home games at the Alamodome until a new permanent stadium was built.\n\nOn September 3, 2014, the city of Oakland claimed it had reached a tentative deal to build a new football stadium in Oakland, which would have resulted in the Coliseum being demolished. The claim was met with silence from the Raiders, who continued to explore San Antonio, and opposition from Alameda County.\n\nOn February 19, 2015, the Raiders and the San Diego Chargers announced plans for a privately financed $1.7 billion stadium that the two teams would have built in Carson upon being approved to move to the Los Angeles market. Both teams stated that they would continue to attempt to get stadiums built in their respective cities. The stadium was approved by the Carson City Council but was defeated by the NFL who voted in favor of building Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park and relocating the St. Louis Rams back to Los Angeles with the Chargers as the second LA team. \n\nIn January 2016, Mark Davis met with Las Vegas Sands owner Sheldon Adelson about building a domed stadium on the UNLV campus for the Raiders and the UNLV Rebels. The stadium location was later moved to a site across Interstate 15 from Mandalay Bay. After the approval of $750 million from the state of Nevada and backing from Bank of America after Adelson pulled out of the project, the Raiders submitted papers for relocation to Las Vegas in January 2017, and on March 27, 2017, the Raiders' relocation to Las Vegas was approved. The team plans to continue to play at the Coliseum through the 2019 NFL season and relocate to Las Vegas in 2020.\n\nThe Raiders played their first game at the stadium on September 18, 1966. In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics moved to Oakland and began play at the stadium. The Athletics' first game was played on April 17, 1968. The stadium complex cost $25.5 million to build and rests on of land. On April 17, 1968, Boog Powell hit the first major league home run in the history of the Coliseum. On May 8 of that year, Catfish Hunter pitched the ninth perfect game in Major League history at the Coliseum. The Coliseum hosted the 1967 and 1969 AFL championship games. Additionally, the venue had hosted the second match of the NPSL Final 1967.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1972 the stadium hosted 3 college football benefit games featuring Bay Area schools versus historically black colleges.\n\nThe Coliseum hosted the 1971 East–West Shrine Game on January 2, 1971.\n\nIn 1972, the Athletics won their first of 3 straight World Series championships and their first since their years in Philadelphia.\n\nThe awkwardness of the baseball-football conversion, as well as the low seating capacity (around 54,000 for football) and that the prime seating on the east side consisted of temporary bleachers led the Raiders to explore other stadium options. One such option was Memorial Stadium on the UC Berkeley campus. Several preseason games were played there in the early 1970s along with one regular season game in 1973 (a 12-7 victory over the Miami Dolphins during September while the A's regular season was going on). However, in response to traffic and parking issues associated with these games (while Cal games drew a large number of students who live on or near campus and walk to the games, Raiders games attracted fans from a larger geographic area who were used to tailgating at the Coliseum and were more likely to drive to games), the City of Berkeley passed a Professional Sports Events License Tax in which the city collected 10% of all gate receipts, making the staging of professional games inside the city cost-prohibitive. The Raiders were granted an injunction from the city collecting the tax, arguing that the tax was a regulatory measure rather than a revenue measure, and was therefore an improper regulation on land held in trust by the Regents of the University of California. However, the grant of the injunction was reversed by the California Court of Appeals, who found it to be a revenue measure, despite the fact that the city had made the measure immediately effective \"due to danger to the public peace, health, and safety of the City of Berkeley as a result of the holding of professional sports events there\".\n\nThe stadium was not well maintained for most of the late 1970s. Its condition was most noticeable during baseball season, when crowds for A's games twice numbered fewer than 1,000. On April 17, 1979, only 653 fans attended the game versus the Seattle Mariners. During this time, it was popularly known as the \"Oakland Mausoleum\".\n\nIn 1980, the Raiders won Super Bowl XV. Two years later, the Raiders moved to Los Angeles, leaving the A's as the only remaining tenants of Oakland Coliseum. Only days later, Finley agreed to sell the A's to Marvin Davis, who planned to move the A's to Denver. However, city and county officials were not about to lose Oakland's status as a major-league city in its own right, and refused to let the A's out of their lease. Finley sold the team instead to the owners of San Francisco-based Levi Strauss & Co.. After the 1986 Major League Baseball season, the original scoreboards were replaced. A new American Sign and Indicator scoreboard and message center was installed behind the left-field bleachers, while the original right-field scoreboard was replaced with a manually operated out-of-town scoreboard. Between the centerfield flagpoles, a new Diamond Vision videoscreen was installed.\n\nThe 1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held at the stadium. From 1988 to 1990, the venue saw 3 more World Series. In 1989, the Athletics won their 4th Series since moving to Oakland, sweeping the San Francisco Giants in the earthquake-interrupted \"Battle of the Bay\" Series.\n\nIn the 1990s, several major concerts were held, but these were not \"Days on the Green\", by definition, because they occurred at night.\n\nIn July 1995, the Raiders agreed to return to Oakland provided that Oakland Coliseum underwent renovations. In November 1995, those renovations commenced and continued through the next summer until the beginning of the 1996 football season (more info below). The new layout also had the somewhat peculiar effect of creating an inward jog in the outfield fence, in left-center and right-center. There are now three distance markers instead of one, at various points of the power alleys, as indicated in the dimensions grid. The Raiders' return also heralded the creation of the \"Black Hole\", a highly recognizable group of fans who occupy one end zone seating during football games.\n\nAlong with the since-demolished Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, the stadium features the unusual configuration of laying the football field on a line from first to third base rather than laying it from home plate to center field, or parallel to one of the foul lines, as with most multipurpose facilities. Thus, a seat behind home plate for baseball is behind the 50-yard line for football. With the Miami Marlins opening their own ballpark in 2012, the stadium became the last remaining venue in the United States that hosts both a Major League Baseball and a National Football League team.\n\nOn April 2, 2006, the broadcast booth was renamed in honor of the late Bill King, a legendary Bay Area sportscaster who was the play-by-play voice of the A's, Raiders and Warriors for 44 years.\n\nSan Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer, announced in November 2007 that they would be playing their \"big draw\" games, such as those featuring David Beckham and the Los Angeles Galaxy, at the stadium instead of their then-home Buck Shaw Stadium (capacity roughly over 10,000) in Santa Clara. Since then the Quakes moved to their new home of Avaya Stadium and play their bigger games in nearby Stanford Stadium.\n\nMidway through the decade, the stadium established a \"no re-entry\" policy. Each ticket can only be used once, after which a second ticket must be purchased in order to re-enter the Coliseum.\n\nOn May 9, 2010, almost 42 years to the day of Catfish Hunter's perfect game, Dallas Braden pitched the 19th perfect game in Major League history at the Coliseum. A commemorative graphic was placed on the baseball outfield wall next to Rickey Henderson's retired number on May 17, their next home game.\n\nAs part of a new 10-year lease signed by the Athletics with the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Authority in 2014, the Oakland Coliseum had a new $10 million scoreboard system (two large outfield scoreboards, 36 feet tall and 145 feet wide, and two ribbon scoreboards) installed for the start of the 2015 MLB season. Also part of the new lease, the Coliseum Authority agreed to pay $1 million a year, with 5% annual increases, into a fund to maintain the stadium.\n\nFor the 2017 Major League Baseball season, the tarp covering a large amount of the baseball configuration has been removed, increasing the capacity to over 47,000 for the first time since 1995. The tarp remains on the football-only Mt. Davis.\n\nCommencing in 1973, the stadium hosted an annual Day on the Green concert series, presented by Bill Graham and his company Bill Graham Presents, which continued on into the early 1990s.\n\nMarvin Gaye made his official return to live performing and touring at the Coliseum on January 4, 1974 and the Coliseum was the basis for his 1 million-selling live album, \"Marvin Gaye Live!\" At the time, music industry executives cited the tour as a \"heralded event\" as Gaye made a comeback to live touring nearly 4 years after the death of his late singing partner Tammi Terrell.\n\nLed Zeppelin played what turned out to be their final North American concerts with twin shows during their 1977 North American Tour. This was due to the brutal assault on Peter Grant's 11-year-old son Warren by a Bill Graham roadie, and the sudden death of Robert Plant's young son Karac in the UK.\n\nParliament-Funkadelic recorded half the album \"\" at the Oakland Coliseum on January 21, 1977. The album was released in April of that year.\n\nThe stadium played host to Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! Benefit Concert on September 23, 1988. The show was headlined by Sting and Peter Gabriel and also featured Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, Tracy Chapman, Youssou N'Dour, Roy Orbison and Joan Baez.\n\nMetallica and Guns N' Roses brought the Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour to the Coliseum on September 24, 1992, with Body Count as their opening act.\n\nU2 played two nights in June 1997 at the Oakland Coliseum as part of their \"PopMart\" tour. They were supported by Oasis, one of the first shows of their \"Be Here Now\" tour.\n\nThe stadium played host to The Gigantour on September 8, 2006, featuring performances by Megadeth, Lamb of God, Opeth, Arch Enemy, Overkill, Into Eternity, Sanctity and The SmashUp.\n\nU2 performed during their 360° Tour on June 7, 2011, with Lenny Kravitz and Moonalice as their opening acts. The show was originally scheduled to take place on June 16, 2010, but was postponed, due to Bono's emergency back surgery.\n\nOn August 5, 2017, Green Day played a homecoming concert at the Coliseum. The show was part of the band's summer tour in support of their third number 1 album, Revolution Radio.\n\nThe stadium holds the distinction of hosting the most concerts by The Grateful Dead with 66 shows between 1979-1995.\n\nRichard Marx shot the video for \"Take This Heart\" on the baseball field of the Coliseum.\n\nThe stadium was the location for the 1994 Disney movie \"Angels in the Outfield\". Although Angel Stadium of Anaheim (known as Anaheim Stadium at the time) was where the Angels actually played, it was damaged in the 1994 Southern California earthquake. Anaheim Stadium was used for views from the outside and aerial views, while the Coliseum was used for interior shots.\n\nThe Coliseum was also used for scenes in the 2011 film \"Moneyball\".\n\nThe stadium has hosted an AMA Supercross Championship round since 2011.\n\nIn recent years, the Coliseum has been criticized as being one of the \"worst stadiums in baseball\". Problems cited include the large amount of foul territory and the addition of Mount Davis. The former allows for more foul-outs while the latter has been criticized for \"ruining\" the ambience of the original configuration.\n\nOne feature of the 1996 expansion was the addition of over 10,000 seats in the upper deck that now spans the outfield in the baseball configuration, enclosing the stadium. Due to the stands' height and the loss of the Oakland hills view, A's fans have derisively nicknamed the structure \"Mount Davis\", after late Raiders owner Al Davis. It has been criticized as an area which has made the Oakland Coliseum look ever more like a football stadium, and not at all one for baseball.\n\nIn 2006, the Athletics covered the entire third deck with a tarpaulin (tarp), reducing capacity to 34,077—the smallest capacity in MLB at the time. Even if a game was otherwise sold out, the A's would not sell any seats in the area. It would remain covered except if they made the World Series. The A's said that closing off the upper deck would create a \"more intimate environment\" for baseball. This drew criticism from fans, the Oakland City Council, and sports marketing analysts baffled at owner Lew Wolff's decision, with some stating that this was cover for a possible move to San Jose (see Cisco Field). There were 20,878 seats covered up by the tarp which would otherwise have been usable for baseball. In 2017, new team President Dave Kaval decided to remove several sections covered by tarps. This increased capacity by 12,103 to 47,170.\n\nIn February 2013, the Oakland Raiders announced that they would cover 11,000 seats in the Mount Davis section with a tarp to avoid blackouts. This reduces capacity to 53,250, by far the smallest in the NFL (league rules require a minimum capacity of 50,000, and no other stadium, barring the temporary-use StubHub Center, seats fewer than 61,000). Under NFL rules, the tarps have to stay in place all season long, no matter if they make the playoffs or not.\n\nOn June 16, 2013 following the game against the Seattle Mariners, the Coliseum experienced a severe sewage backup. This led to pipes leaking out puddles of sewage into the showers, offices, visitor training room and storage areas on the clubhouse level of the stadium, all of which are 3 feet (1 m) below sea level. After the game, the A's and Mariners were forced to share the Oakland Raiders locker room, located on the stadium's second floor. According to Coliseum officials, the stadium's aging plumbing system was overtaxed after a six-game homestand that drew close to baseball capacity crowds totaling 171,756 fans.\n\nThis was not the first time sewage problems cropped up at the stadium. For instance, on one occasion the Angels complained about E. coli in the visiting team's training room after a backup. Backups occur even when no events are taking place there. For instance, Wolff wanted to go to dinner on June 12, 2013 (while the A's were on the road) at one of the Coliseum's restaurants, only to find out that food service had been halted due to a sewage leak in the kitchen.\n\n"}
{"id": "731192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=731192", "title": "Olympic symbols", "text": "Olympic symbols\n\nThe Olympic symbols are icons, flags, and symbols used by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to elevate the Olympic Games. Somesuch as the flame, fanfare, and themeare more commonly used during Olympic competition, but others, such as the flags, can be seen throughout the years.The Olympic flag was created under the guidance of Baron Coubertin in 1913 and was released in 1914.But it was first hoisted in 1920 in Belgium at the Antwerp Olympic games in the main stadium.\n\nThe Olympic motto is the hendiatris \"Citius, Altius, Fortius\", which is Latin for \"Faster, Higher, Stronger\". It was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin upon the creation of the International Olympic Committee in 1894. Coubertin borrowed it from his friend Henri Didon, a Dominican priest who was an athletics enthusiast. Coubertin said \"These three words represent a programme of moral beauty. The aesthetics of sport are intangible.\" The motto was introduced in 1924 at the Olympic Games in Paris. A more informal but well-known motto, also introduced by Coubertin, is \"The most important thing is not to win but to take part!\" Coubertin got this motto from a sermon by the Bishop of Pennsylvania during the 1908 London Games.\n\nThe rings are five interlocking rings, coloured blue, yellow, black, green, and red on a white field, known as the \"Olympic rings\". The symbol was originally designed in 1912 by de Coubertin. He appears to have intended the rings to represent the five continents: Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and America. According to Coubertin, the colours of the rings together with the white of the background included the colours composing every competing nation's flag at the time. Upon its initial introduction, Coubertin stated the following in the August 1912 edition of \"Olympique\":\n\nIn his article published in the \"Olympic Revue\" the official magazine of the International Olympic Committee in November 1992, the American historian Robert Barney explains that the idea of the interlaced rings came to Pierre de Coubertin when he was in charge of the USFSA, an association founded by the union of two French sports associations and until 1925, responsible for representing the International Olympic Committee in France: The emblem of the union was two interlaced rings (like the vesica piscis typical interlaced marriage rings) and originally the idea of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung: for him, the ring symbolized continuity and the human being.\n\nThe 1914 Congress was suspended due to the outbreak of World War I, but the symbol and flag were later adopted. They would first officially debut at the Games of the VII Olympiad in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1920.\n\nThe symbol's popularity and widespread use began during the lead-up to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Carl Diem, president of the Organizing Committee of the 1936 Summer Olympics, wanted to hold a torchbearers' ceremony in the stadium at Delphi, site of the famous oracle, where the Pythian Games were also held. For this reason he ordered construction of a milestone with the Olympic rings carved in the sides, and that a torchbearer should carry the flame along with an escort of three others from there to Berlin. The ceremony was celebrated but the stone was never removed. Later, two American authors, Lynn and Gray Poole, when visiting Delphi in the late 1950s, saw the stone and reported in their \"History of the Ancient Games\" that the Olympic rings design came from ancient Greece. This has become known as \"Carl Diem's Stone\". This created a myth that the symbol had an ancient Greek origin.\n\nThe current view of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is that the symbol \"reinforces the idea\" that the Olympic Movement is international and welcomes all countries of the world to join. As can be read in the Olympic Charter, the Olympic symbol represents the union of the \"five continents\" of the world and the meeting of athletes from throughout the world at the Olympic Games. However, no continent is represented by any specific ring. Prior to 1951, the official handbook stated that each colour corresponded to a particular continent: blue for Europe, yellow for Asia, black for Africa, green for Australia and Oceania, and red for the Americas; this was removed because there was no evidence that Coubertin had intended it (the quotation above was probably an afterthought). Nevertheless, the logo of the Association of National Olympic Committees places the logo of each of its five continental associations inside the ring of the corresponding colour.\n\nThe Olympic flag was created by Pierre de Coubertin in 1925.\nThere are specific Olympic flags that are displayed by cities that will be hosting the next Olympic games. During each Olympic closing ceremony in what is traditionally known as the Antwerp Ceremony, the flag is passed from the mayor of one host city to the next host, where it will then be taken to the new host and displayed at city hall. These flags should not be confused with the larger Olympic flags designed and created specifically for each games, which are flown over the host stadium and then retired. Because there is no specific flag for this purpose, the flags flown over the stadiums generally have subtle differences, including minor color variations, and, more noticeably, the presence (or lack) of white outlines around each ring.\n\nThe first Olympic flag was presented to the Jr National Olympics at the 1920 Summer Olympics by the city of Antwerp, Belgium. At the end of the Games, the flag could not be found and a new Olympic flag had to be made for the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. Despite it being a replacement, the IOC officially still calls this the \"Antwerp Flag\" instead of the \"Paris Flag\". It was passed on to the next organizing city of the Summer Olympics or Winter Olympics until the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway, when a separate Olympic flag was created to be used only at the Winter Olympics \"(see below)\". The 1924 flag then continued to be used at the Summer Olympics until the Games of Seoul 1988 when it was retired.\n\nIn 1997, at a banquet hosted by the US Olympic Committee, a reporter was interviewing Hal Haig Prieste who had won a bronze medal in platform diving as a member of the 1920 US Olympic team. The reporter mentioned that the IOC had not been able to find out what had happened to the original Olympic flag. \"I can help you with that,\" Prieste said, \"It's in my suitcase.\" At the end of the Antwerp Olympics, spurred on by teammate Duke Kahanamoku, he climbed a flagpole and stole the Olympic flag. For 77 years the flag was stored away in the bottom of his suitcase. The flag was returned to the IOC by Prieste, by then 103 years old, in a special ceremony held at the 2000 Games in Sydney. The original Antwerp Flag is now on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, with a plaque thanking him for donating it.\n\nThe Oslo flag was presented to the IOC by the mayor of Oslo, Norway, during the 1952 Winter Olympics. Since then, it has been passed to the next organizing city for the Winter Olympics. Currently, the actual Oslo flag is kept preserved in a special box, and a replica has been used during recent closing ceremonies instead.\n\nAs a successor to the Antwerp Flag, the Seoul flag was presented to the IOC at the 1988 Summer Olympics by the city of Seoul, South Korea, and has since then been passed on to the next organizing city of the Summer Olympics. The Seoul flag is currently on display at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building.\n\nAs a successor to the Seoul Flag, the Rio flag was presented to the IOC at the 2016 Summer Olympics by the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and has since then been passed on to the next organizing city of the Summer Olympics, Tokyo.\n\nFor the inaugural Youth Olympic Games, an Olympic flag was created for the junior version of the Games. The flag is similar to the Olympic flag, but has the host city and year on it and was first presented to Singapore by IOC President Jacques Rogge. During the closing ceremony on 26 August 2010, Singapore officials presented it to the next organizing committee, Nanjing 2014.\n\nFor the inaugural winter Youth Olympic Games, an Olympic flag was presented to the IOC at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics by the city of Innsbruck, Austria, and has since then been passed on to the next organizing city of the Winter Youth Olympics.\n\nThe modern tradition of moving the Olympic flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue began with the Berlin Games in 1936. Months before the Games are held, the Olympic flame is lit on a torch, with the rays of the Sun concentrated by a parabolic reflector, at the site of the Ancient Olympics in Olympia, Greece. The torch is then taken out of Greece, most often to be taken around the country or continent where the Games are held. The Olympic torch is carried by athletes, leaders, celebrities, and ordinary people alike, and at times in unusual conditions, such as being electronically transmitted via satellite for Montreal 1976, submerged underwater without being extinguished for Sydney 2000, or in space and at the North Pole for Sochi 2014. On the final day of the torch relay, the day of the Opening Ceremony, the Flame reaches the main stadium and is used to light a cauldron situated in a prominent part of the venue to signify the beginning of the Games.\n\nThe Olympic medals awarded to winners are another symbol associated with the Olympic games. The medals are made of gold-plated silver – for the gold medals – silver, or bronze, and are awarded to the top three finishers in a particular event. Each medal for an Olympiad has a common design, decided upon by the organizers for the particular games. From 1928 until 2000, the obverse side of the medals contained an image of Nike, the traditional goddess of victory, holding a palm in her left hand and a winner's crown in her right. This design was created by Giuseppe Cassioli. For each Olympic games, the reverse side as well as the labels for each Olympiad changed, reflecting the host of the games.\n\nIn 2004, the obverse side of the medals changed to make more explicit reference to the Greek character of the games. In this design, the goddess Nike flies into the Panathenic stadium, reflecting the renewal of the games. The design was by Greek jewelry designer Elena Votsi.\n\nOlympic diplomas are given to competitors placing fourth, fifth, and sixth since 1949, and to competitors placing seventh and eighth since 1981.\n\nThe \"Olympic Hymn\", officially known as the \"Olympic Anthem\", is played when the Olympic flag is raised. It was composed by Spyridon Samaras with words from a poem of the Greek poet and writer Kostis Palamas. Both the poet and the composer were the choice of Demetrius Vikelas, a Greek Pro-European and the first President of the IOC. The anthem was performed for the first time for the ceremony of opening of the 1896 Athens Olympic Games but wasn't declared the official hymn by the IOC until 1958. In the following years, every hosting nation commissioned the composition of a specific Olympic hymn for their own edition of the Games until the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley.\n\nOther notable Olympic anthems and fanfares include:\n\n\nSeveral other composers have contributed Olympic music, including Henry Mancini, Francis Lai, Marvin Hamlisch, Philip Glass, David Foster, Mikis Theodorakis, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Vangelis, Basil Poledouris, Michael Kamen, and Mark Watters.it had oath too : we swear that we will take part in the Olympic Games in loyal competition, respecting the regulations which govern them and desirous of participating in them in the true spirit of sportsmanship for the honour of our country and for the glory of sports.\n\nThe \"kotinos\" (), is an olive branch, originally of wild olive-tree, intertwined to form a circle or a horse-shoe, introduced by Heracles. In the ancient Olympic Games there were no gold, silver, or bronze medals. There was only one winner per event, crowned with an olive wreath made of wild olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Aristophanes in Plutus makes a sensible remark as to why victorious athletes are crowned with a wreath made of wild olive instead of gold. The victorious athletes were honoured, feted, and praised. Their deeds were heralded and chronicled so that future generations could appreciate their accomplishments.\n\nHerodotus describes the following story which is relevant to the olive wreath. Xerxes was interrogating some Arcadians after the Battle of Thermopylae. He inquired why there were so few Greek men defending Thermopylae. The answer was \"All other men are participating in the Olympic Games\". And when asked \"What is the prize for the winner?\", \"An olive-wreath\" came the answer. Then Tigranes, one of his generals uttered a most noble saying: \"Good heavens! Mardonius, what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour.\"\n\nHowever, in later times, this was not their only reward; the athlete was rewarded with a generous sum of money by his country. The kotinos tradition was renewed specifically for the Athens 2004 Games, although in this case it was bestowed together with the gold medal. Apart from its use in the awards ceremonies, the kotinos was chosen as the 2004 Summer Olympics emblem.\n\nThe Olympic salute is a variant of the Roman salute, with the right arm and hand stretched and pointing upward, the palm outward and downward, with the fingers touching. However, unlike the Roman Salute, the arm is raised higher and at an angle to the right from the shoulder. The greeting is visible on the official posters of the games at Paris 1924 and Berlin 1936.\n\nThe Olympic salute has fallen out of use since World War II because of its strong resemblance to the Nazi salute. It was used for the last time by the French team in the opening ceremony of the 1948 Winter Olympics.\n\nSince the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France, the Olympic Games have had a mascot, usually an animal native to the area or occasionally human figures representing the cultural heritage. The first major mascot in the Olympic Games was Misha in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Misha was used extensively during the opening and closing ceremonies, had a TV animated cartoon and appeared on several merchandise products. Nowadays, most of the merchandise aimed at young people focuses on the mascots, rather than the Olympic flag or organization logos.\n\nThe Olympic movement is very protective of its symbols; as many jurisdictions have given the movement exclusive trademark rights to any interlocking arrangement of five rings, and usage of the word \"Olympic\". The rings are not eligible for copyright protection, both because of their date of creation and because five circles arranged in a pattern do not reach the threshold of originality required to be copyrighted.\n\nThe movement has taken action against numerous groups alleged to have violated their trademarks, including the Gay Games; the Minneapolis-based band The Hopefuls, formerly The Olympic Hopefuls; the Redneck Olympics or Redneck Games; Awana Clubs International, a Christian youth ministry who used the term for its competitive games; and Wizards of the Coast, publisher at the time of the IOC's complaint of the card game \"Legend of the Five Rings\".\n\nIn 1938, the Norwegian brewery Frydenlund patented a label for its root beer which featured the five Olympic rings. In 1952, when Norway was to host the Winter Olympics, the Olympic Committee was notified by Norway's Patent Office that it was Frydenlund who owned the rights to the rings in that country. Today, the successor company Ringnes AS owns the rights to use the patented five rings on its root beer. In addition, a few other companies have been successful in using the Olympic name, such as Olympic Paint, which has a paintbrush in the form of a torch as its logo, and the former Greek passenger carrier Olympic Airlines.\n\nCertain other sporting organizations and events have been granted permission by the IOC to use the word \"Olympics\" in their name, such as the Special Olympics, an international sporting event held every four years for people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIn recent years, organizing committees have also demanded the passing of laws to combat ambush marketing by non-official sponsors during the Games – such as the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 – putting heavy restrictions on using any term or imagery that could constitute an unauthorized association with the games, including mere mentioning of the host city, the year, and others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3467548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3467548", "title": "Priority draft pick", "text": "Priority draft pick\n\nThe priority draft pick is a type of draft selection in the Australian Football League's AFL Draft. Priority draft picks are additional draft picks, located at or near the start of the draft, which are given only to the poorest performing teams, to provide additional help for those teams to improve on-field performances in future years. Prior to 2012, a team automatically received a priority draft pick if its win-loss record met pre-defined eligibility criteria; since 2012, priority draft picks will be awarded on a discretionary basis by the AFL commission.\n\nThe priority draft pick has been the consistent subject of controversy, as several poor-performing teams have been accused of tanking during the later part of the season to ensure that they qualify for the additional draft pick.\n\nAt the conclusion of each AFL season, there are three AFL drafts: the National Draft, the Pre-Season Draft and the Rookie Draft. The National Draft is the most important of the drafts, as it is the primary recruitment method for prospective young players once they reach the age of 18.\n\nIn the draft, the selections are arranged into rounds, with each team having one selection per round. Selections in each round are arranged in reverse ladder position order.\n\nUnder current AFL rules, enacted from the 2012 season onwards, a club can receive a priority draft pick at the discretion of the AFL Commission.\n\nA formula which will assist with determining whether or not a team receives a priority draft pick, and at which round in the draft that pick will be taken, has been developed that takes into account such factors as:\n\nIn 2016, the Brisbane Lions became the first club to be awarded a priority draft pick under the current rules. However, through a series of trades in that year's AFL draft, the Sydney Swans, who had finished as minor premiers in the season that had just passed and reached the Grand Final, ended up with it instead. The Swans used this pick to draft Will Hayward.\n\nThe draft was established in 1986 in an attempt to reduce the inherent inequities of the league under zoning, where the clubs with the most successful zones, such as Carlton, Collingwood and Essendon, were able to perennially dominate the competition, while teams with weaker zones, such as St Kilda, Sydney and Footscray, were perennially close to or at the bottom of the ladder. The draft was intended to give the weakest teams access to the best prospective players.\n\nBy 1993, some of the weakest teams (e.g. Sydney Swans, Brisbane Bears and Richmond) were still enduring prolonged periods of poor performance, so the priority draft pick was introduced in the Draft of that year to further assist these teams. In its first incarnation:\n\nIt became clear, however, that a team with reasonable prospects could finish with five wins and receive a roster boosting priority draft pick as a result of an isolated poor season due to key players suffering injuries, internal dissent and/or other off-field trouble. This was unfair and counterproductive to the initial \"raison d'être\" of the priority pick, which was to help consistently poor teams with minimal or no prospects to rebuild.\n\nFor this reason, the AFL made further amendments to the priority pick rules in 2006.\n\nFrom the 2006 draft, a club became eligible for a priority draft pick in the National Draft if it finished a season with fewer than 16.5 premiership points (four wins). The location of the priority draft picks within the overall National Draft now depended upon the team's performance over the previous two years: \n\nAnother way to describe this is that in a sequence of consecutive poor seasons, the priority draft pick in the first season would be taken after the first round, and any second or subsequent priority draft picks would be taken before the first round.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the AFL, the priority draft pick became controversial in the late 2000s and early 2010s because of the potential for corruption, as it could be automatically awarded based on the performance of the club over the past two seasons with a defined cut-off point (16.5 premiership points or four wins).\n\nIn the 2012 pre-season, the AFL, with the unanimous support of the 18 clubs, removed the provision for priority picks automatically based upon finishing results, and with the AFL commission retaining the power to award priority picks on a discretionary basis.\n\nTo allow for this situation, a formula has been developed that takes into account such factors as:\nTo eliminate the perception of tanking, the formula for priority picks is kept confidential by the AFL Commission.\n\nIn 2016, the Brisbane Lions became the first club to be given a priority draft pick under the current rules, with that pick located after the first round (although ended up with the pick after the trade period).\n\nThere was annual speculation that poor performing teams manipulated their results after they were eliminated from finals contention, in order to ensure they remain below the eligibility criterion and receive a priority pick under the pre-2012 format; this was referred to as \"tanking.\"\n\nThere are a wide variety of behaviours which could be considered to be tanking. These include:\n\nWhile all of these behaviours can be interpreted as an attempt to avoid winning matches, all but the first point can also be justified as a sensible player management and development strategy for a team with no chance of playing finals, which complicates the debate about tanking. In addition, tanking has the significant issue that fans of these clubs sometimes openly support against their teams on game day; however, this could also be justified as a sign of fan dissatisfaction at the club's poor performance and/or its administration.\n\nAlso complicating the debate is the fact that different people have different opinions on what is acceptable behaviour. When speaking about 's 2010 priority draft pick, coach John Worsfold openly defended his right to play young players in unfamiliar positions to assist their development; but, when speaking about 's 2007 priority draft pick, assistant coach Tony Liberatore said he personally thought it was wrong to play younger players in place of senior players whose niggling injuries would not be bad enough to force their omission if the team were playing finals, and Brock McLean revealed that he requested to be traded away from the Melbourne Football Club because he disagreed with similar strategies in the lead-up to Melbourne's 2009 priority draft pick.\n\nThe legal implications of tanking on sports betting is also a significant problem, and in 2009 a betting agency temporarily suspended betting on the wooden spoon when it became concerned about the potential legal ramifications if tanking or other corruption were ever proven. The penalty for any player or official found to have been involved in tanking is a possible lifetime suspension and/or a fine of $100,000 for each offence.\n\nBy shifting the Priority Round from before to after the First Round in 2006, the AFL reduced the incentive to tank, but did not eliminate it; the incentive was reduced further with the 2012 reform. The AFL has the endorsement of the Victorian Commission for Gambling Regulation that the integrity of the game is sufficiently protected under the priority system.\n\nSome members of the media, particularly from the \"Herald Sun\", previously called for the priority draft pick to be scrapped altogether, and some journalists call for a draft lottery to be applied in the first round for the bottom five or six teams. When asked in 2011, the AFL Players Association's official position was that it would like to see the priority pick abolished due to the perception of tanking and its impact on the public's confidence in the game, rather than any suggestion of actual corruption.\n\nIn 2011, sacked coach Dean Bailey stated that he coached to \"ensure the club was well placed for draft picks\" in 2008 and 2009, and admitted to playing players in unusual positions, but he never claimed that the team had deliberately lost matches. Tony Liberatore made similar statements in 2008, when he claimed that he felt like \"winning wasn't the be all and end all\" when Carlton received a priority pick in 2007, but he also said that he'd never seen anything to suggest that players were deliberately losing matches. In both cases, the statements were seen as an admission of guilt to tanking by some, but in the absence of an explicit directive to deliberately lose, acceptable by others, and the AFL was satisfied that neither team had broken its tanking rules.\n\nThe Round 22, 2007 match between and , nicknamed the Kreuzer Cup, was the most controversial match in the tanking debate. It was the last match of the regular season, and both Melbourne and Carlton had a record of 4–17, meaning that whichever team won the match would lose the chance at a priority draft pick, and both clubs had already avoided the ignominy of the wooden spoon, as had secured it with a final record of 3–18–1. Overall, this meant that there was no benefit for either club to win, but a significant benefit to losing.\n\nThe stakes were particularly high in Carlton's case, because the club had also received a priority pick in the 2006 season; as such, if it lost this match, it would receive the No. 1 draft pick as its priority pick. In Melbourne's case, the priority pick it could have received would be the No. 18 pick; the No. 1 pick would go to wooden spooners Richmond if Melbourne lost the match. The match became known as the Kreuzer Cup, named after Northern Knights' ruckman Matthew Kreuzer, who had been expected to be (and was eventually, by Carlton) selected with the No. 1 pick in the 2007 AFL Draft.\n\nThe match was high scoring, played with low intensity, poor skills and very little defensive pressure, and two players (Carlton's Heath Scotland and Melbourne's Travis Johnstone) gathered more than 40 disposals. Melbourne had a five-goal lead by quarter time, and ended up winning the match 21.13 (139) to 15.18 (108). Carlton went on to recruit Kreuzer with the No. 1 pick in the draft.\n\nMelbourne entered the match with a record of 3–14. Because it had received a priority draft pick in 2008, it had the potential to receive a priority draft pick at the start of the draft if won no more than one of its final five matches.\n\nThe match was close for much of the game, but Melbourne kicked away to lead by a few goals in the final quarter. Richmond was then able to make a comeback, and an after-the-siren goal by Jordan McMahon gave Richmond a four-point win. The \"Herald Sun\" later accused coach Melbourne coach Dean Bailey of making positional changes in the final quarter which were so nonsensical that they could only have been designed to ensure Richmond would make a comeback: this included moving key defenders James Frawley and Matthew Warnock into the forward-line, resting key midfielders, and using Brad Miller as a ruckman.\n\nIn late 2012 and early 2013, Melbourne was thoroughly investigated for its conduct in this and other games which occurred in late 2009. The club was found not guilty of tanking, but guilty of bringing the game into disrepute and was fined $500,000, with Bailey (who was fired as coach in 2011) being suspended for 16 matches and football operations officer Chris Connelly being suspended for 12 months.\n\n"}

{"id": "30861539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30861539", "title": "Serve (tennis)", "text": "Serve (tennis)\n\nA serve (or, more formally, a service) in tennis is a shot to start a point. A player will hit the ball with a racquet so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net. Normally players begin a serve by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the highest point of the toss). The ball can only touch the net on a return and will be considered good if it falls on the opposite side. If the ball contacts the net on the serve but then proceeds to the proper service box, it is called a \"let\"; this is not a legal serve in the major tours (but see below) although it is also not a \"fault\". \nPlayers typically serve overhead, but serving underhand, although rare, is allowed. The serve is the only shot a player can take their time to set up instead of having to react to an opponent's shot. But as of 2012, there is a 25-second limit to be allowed between points.\n\nThe serve is one of the more difficult shots for a novice, but once mastered it can be a considerable advantage. Advanced players can hit the serve in many different ways and often use it as an offensive weapon to gain an advantage in the point or to win it outright. Because of this, players above beginner level are expected to win most of their service games, and the ability to break an opponent's serve plays a crucial role in a match.\n\nFor any serve, the server stands behind the baseline without touching it. For the first point of any game, the server stands to the right of the center point of the baseline and serves diagonally across the net to the left side (from the server's perspective) of the court, into the service box which extends to the service line about midway into the opponent's court. For the second point of the game, the serve is diagonally from the left to the right side of the court, and for each subsequent point of the same game the positioning is the opposite of that on the previous point.\n\nAn attempt at a serve may result in one of the following outcomes:\n\nA \"good serve\" occurs when a legally delivered ball lands in the cross-court service box or on any line bounding it without touching anything in flight. Once a \"good serve\" is hit, the play begins.\n\nA \"let\" occurs when a legally delivered ball lands in the cross-court service box having touched the net cord (but not the net post or any other object). Play stops immediately, and the server is allowed another attempt. The umpire (or opposing player when there is no umpire) will usually say \"let\" or \"net\" to signal to the server a let has occurred. Lets occur more often on first serves, as the server is more cautious on the success of a second serve.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why a service attempt may result in a fault.\n\nAfter a fault, play stops immediately. If there has been only one fault on this point, the server is then allowed another attempt. If there have been two faults on this point, the point is awarded to the receiver: this is known as a \"\".\n\nOn a service, the receiver is required to allow the ball to bounce before attempting to hit it. In the extremely rare event of the receiver's racket or body touching a legally delivered ball before it bounces, the point is immediately awarded to the server.\n\nA \"first serve\" is made when there has been no fault on the point; a \"second serve\" occurs when there has already been one fault on the point. On a second serve, the server is in danger of losing the point if there is another fault.\n\nThe rules make no distinction between the first and second serve. However, the tactics used are different. The first serve is typically struck with the maximum power, skill, and deception the player is capable of with the aim of winning the point either outright or on the next stroke, by forcing the receiver into a disadvantageous position. The second serve is usually more conservative to avoid getting a double fault, and is typically hit with less power or a higher curve. Second serves often have more topspin and kick on the ball.\n\nThere are two popular stances in the tennis serve: the platform stance and the pinpoint stance.\n\nIn the platform stance the feet are kept about shoulder-width apart throughout the serve, providing stable support and easy weight transfer from the back to the front foot. The hips rotate, and sometimes the back foot swings forward to complete the hip rotation.\n\nIn the pinpoint stance, the feet start apart, but as the serve unfolds, the back foot slides or steps forward until it is adjacent to or slightly behind the front foot. As a result, the feet provide a very small base of support and balance may be a problem.\n\nThe pinpoint serve provides better velocity, since the feet come together as a single unit, allowing them to push harder against the ground and gain more leg power. However, the center of gravity moves more than in the platform stance, so the player must have good body control in order to contact the ball consistently.\nPlayers will sacrifice some power with the platform serve, but their balance will be better so they should be more consistent. It's still possible to produce good power with the platform serve—some big servers, such as Milos Raonic and Roger Federer, use a variation of a platform stance.\n\nThe serve each player uses will depend on their individual abilities and what they need the most—power or consistency.\nIf they already have good body control but would like to produce extra power, they could try the pinpoint stance. If consistency is their problem, they can use the platform stance.\n\nPlatform stance and the pinpoint stance are closed stances. Fore a very long time, players who used an open stance to serve has been regarded as a sign of tennis beginner. Things have changed in recent years. At elite level, Venus Williams had used semi-open stance to serve in the past (she went back to use traditional closed stance and stayed to the old way currently). Beside Venus, Nikola Mektic and Viktor Troicki both have abandoned closed stance to use open stance to serve.\n\nIn the game of tennis, there are four commonly used serves: the \"flat serve\", the \"slice serve\", the \"kick serve\", and the \"underhand serve\". All of these serves are legal in professional and amateur play.\n\nThe term \"kick serve\" is ambiguous. It may be used as a synonym for the twist serve or the American twist. However, \"kick serve\" is commonly used to refer to any serve with heavy topspin or kick on it.\n\nServers can gain a tactical advantage by varying the type of serve and the ball's placement. The flat serve and slice serve are used primarily as first serves because they are more likely to yield an ace or force an error, although they require high accuracy. Second serves usually have topspin or kick on them, which makes them less likely to land in the net or out of bounds. Kick serves also make a good change-up as a first serve.\n\nA flat serve is hit with a Continental grip (holding the racket as if it were an axe) and a swing path directly through the ball, which causes the ball to cut quickly through the air without spinning. Some professional players can hit flat serves at speeds near .\n\nA flat serve must come close to the net therefore having a small margin for error. Therefore, flat serves are usually hit straight across the center, where the net is lowest. They are usually delivered as first serves, when the server does not risk a double fault. The ball is thrown straight above and slightly forward for the optimal serving point.\n\nA slice serve is hit with sidespin, which requires the server to brush the back of the ball toward their dominant side with the racket. It is commonly hit with the Continental grip or the Eastern backhand grip (using the forehand face of the racket). The ball is thrown slightly to the dominant side of the server then is struck laterally on the server's dominant side.\n\nFor a right-handed player, a sliced serve's sidespin causes the ball to curve leftward. When the ball bounces, it skids and curves farther leftward. The curve of a good slice serve can draw the receiver wide of the singles sideline to play the ball. Since a slice serve has little or no topspin on it, it cannot be aimed high over the net and has little margin for error. Therefore, it is generally used as a first serve. It can be used to ace the receiver, to draw the receiver out of position, or to \"jam\" the receiver with a serve curving sharply towards his or her body.\n\nThe reverse slice serve (or inside-out serve) is analogous to the screwball pitch in baseball. It is hit with the opposite spin of the slice serve. The server must pronate his or her racket arm and sweep the racket across his or her body while striking the ball when hitting a reverse slice serve. Because the direction of spin applied is reversed relative to the standard slice serve, a reverse slice serve from a right-handed player will have the same motion as a slice serve from a left-handed player, and \"vice versa\".\n\nIn professional and amateur tennis, the reverse slice serve is rarely used except as a novelty. As the word \"reverse\" is defined, one must hit opposite to the side and opposite to the path of the slice struck serve.\n\nHolcombe Ward and Dwight Davis introduced the kick/American twist serve in the late 1800s. The kick (or topspin) serve is generated by tossing the ball over the head, then hitting it laterally on the server's non-dominant side brushing upward toward the dominant side. When hit correctly, the ball clears the net in a high arc with heavy topspin, causing the ball to dive into the service box. Upon hitting the surface of the court, the ball may bounce high directly toward the receiver for a kick serve, or to the left for the receiver for an American twist serve. The physics of the spinning ball in flight involves the Magnus effect because the spinning ball creates a whirlpool of air around itself. The twist serve is a more extreme version of the kick serve, which involves more brushing of the ball from the 7–8 o'clock position to the 1–2 o'clock position, and faster swing speeds. If performed exceptionally, it can completely change the direction of the ball movement away from the other player, although this requires a very strong and flexible back.\n\nKick/topspin serves are often used as both first and second serves. As a first serve, a player will put more pace on the ball, while it is a consistent second serve since the spin brings it into the service box with high net clearance.\n\nThe reverse kick/American twist serve is rarely used except as a novelty. As the word \"reverse\" is defined, one must hit opposite to the side and opposite to the path of the kick struck serve.\n\nThe underhand serve is struck below shoulder level. In children's tennis, young children may be encouraged to use the underhand serve on courts. Although this serve is legal, it may be seen as unsportsmanlike in adult tennis. Some notable examples include Michael Chang's in the Round of 16 at the 1989 French Open against Ivan Lendl, and Martina Hingis was booed by the crowd for hitting one at the 1999 French Open.\n\nA pat-a-cake serve is a serve in which the racket is not swung behind the head (as in a proper serve). The player will simply toss the ball up and \"pat\" or tap it over the net to get it in play. It is often used by beginning players, or players who never had proper instruction. The term is usually employed belittlingly.\n\n\nSince the server has the advantage of being the initial aggressor, for his opponent to return the ball and to keep it in play often involves the defensive endeavor of minimizing the opponent's advantage. \nThis may involve simply lunging to get the racket on the ball before it passes. If a controlled return of service is possible, a hard groundstroke to one side or the other of the opponents's baseline may be performed. If the server rushes the net immediately upon hitting the serve, the returner has several options: return the ball at the feet of the server not far past the net, forcing him to hit a half volley (which is hard to do aggressively); lob the ball over the rushing server's head; or hit a passing shot hard and low over the net too far to the left or right for the server to hit it.\n\n\n"}

The stadium is divided into two stands: North, which consists of 2,500 seats among which is the press box along with the team pads, and the South, which consists mainly of the Pelister supporters and seats about 5,000.\n\nThe stadium was built back in 1937. \n\nA record attendance of 9,700 was set in March 1991 for the Marshals Cup match against Hajduk Split. \n\nPelister have hosted European cup matches at Tumbe Kafe on four occasions. Swiss club St. Gallen was the last team to visit the stadium back on 9 August 2001 for the UEFA Cup. The stadium is most remembered for the violence that occurred back on 13 June 1993, before a Macedonian First League fixture between eternal rivals Pelister and Vardar. The match never got started because Pelister supporters Čkembari set fire to the wooden bleacher seats, collapsed the old protective fence and clashed with the police. During the incident, most of the south stand was destroyed.\n\nIn June 2010, several necropolises were discovered at Tumbe Kafe that may date back to the third century.\n\nOn 2 June 2012, the stadium was host to a relegation/promotion play-off match between FK Teteks and FK Skopje.\n\nOn 8 April 2014, Bitola mayor Vladimir Taleski along with architectural firm MEGARON Engineering from Skopje, promoted a new stadium reconstruction. According to the plan, the construction work is set to begin in June 2014 and the investment is worth over €8 million. The stadium will have a capacity of 12,000 seats and would be a UEFA category two standard which means it will be able to host European and international matches. Three new stands are to be built and the current southern stand is to be overhauled, along with adding an athletic track around the pitch. In the press release Taleski stated, \"We are going to build a stadium that Bitola has never had since the time of Heraclea. The realization of the project will start on June 1, where the largest investment and contents are related to the northern stand which is to amount to about €4.5 million, while the total amount of the whole stadium is around €8 million.\" \n\nIn April 2015, renovations began of UEFA's \"Hat-trick 4\" project.\n\nIn 2014, citizens of Bitola began an internet campaign called \"Sakame Stadion\", or \"We Want a Stadium\". The main reason for the campaign was to generate support for building a new stadium in Bitola. It was also to bring notice of the current stadium's deteriorating condition and put pressure on mayor Taleski to fulfil his campaign promise from 2012. The \"Sakame Stadion\" motto has now been used on hundreds of occasions, by fans, citizens and representatives of the Macedonian diaspora around the world. Photos of people holding the message on paper are published regularly online, among those from famous sportsmen (most notably footballers Goran Pandev and Gonzalo Higuaín), reporters, celebrities, officials and football clubs from Macedonia and beyond.\n\n"}
