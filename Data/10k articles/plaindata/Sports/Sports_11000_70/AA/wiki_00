It was the first time Venezuela hosted the competition (which it did again in 1982), and a new military shooting range had been constructed in the suburbs of Caracas for the event.\n\nAfter their successful debut in the 1952 Summer Olympics, the Soviet Union now participated for the first time in the World Championships, and won 20 of the 30 gold medals. Rifle shooter Anatoli Bogdanov, the star of the 1952 shooting competitions in Helsinki, dominated once again with six individual and four team victories. He broke the world record in the 300 metre rifle three positions match with a margin of nine points. In the shotgun events, the United States and Italy were still on top, but the shooting greatness of especially Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries had now diminished, shifting the tide eastward.\n\nAs in most other events, the Soviet team won the team championship in 25 metre center-fire pistol. The American marksman Arthur Jackson commented that the western shooters watched with a mixed sense of pity and relief as the Soviet team shot their archaic Nagant M1895 revolvers in the pre-event training. On the match day they revealed their practical joke and instead brought brand new American Smith & Wesson match revolvers, shooting the same kind of gun and ammunition as the individual champion, and winning three points ahead of the American team.\n"}

Their large size and light weight take little effort to propel; they travel very slowly and generally must be caught with two hands.\n\nThey became popular in the beach-themed films of the 1960s starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. These movies include \"Beach Party\", \"Muscle Beach Party\", \"Beach Blanket Bingo\" and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini\".\n\nBeach balls range from hand-sized to over across or larger. They generally have a set of soft plastic panels, with two circular end panels, one with an oral inflation valve, intended to be inflated by mouth or pump. A common design is vertical solid colored stripes alternating with white stripes. There are also numerous other designs, which include but are not limited to beach balls in a single solid color, promotional beach balls with advertisements or company slogans, as globes or as Emojis.\n\nSome manufacturers specify the size of their beach balls (which is often confused with the diameter) as the tip-to-tip length of a deflated ball (approximately half the circumference), or even the length of the panels before they have their ends cut and joined into a beach ball. Thus the actual diameter may be about formula_1 (≈ 0.6366…) of the nominal \"⌀\".\n\nMoreover, other sizes of beach balls exist, ranging from smaller to larger ones. There are beach balls that have a diameter of or even .\n\nThe world's largest beach ball was made in London, England on May 30, 2017. It was carried by a barge on River Thames. It had a diameter of with the word \"Baywatch\" written all over it. It was produced by Paramount Pictures to promote the 2017 movie \"Baywatch\". The record was registered by Guinness and the certificates were given to the members of the film's cast.\n\nBeach ball sports include water polo and volleyball. While they are much less expensive than the balls used in professional sports, they are also much less durable as most of them are made of soft plastic. Giant beach balls may be tossed between crowd members at concerts, festivals, and sporting events. Many graduates use beach balls as a prank during ceremonies, hitting them around the crowd. They are bounced around crowds at cricket, baseball and football games but frequently confiscated and popped by security. Some security personnel at these events might even inspect the beach ball's interior after tearing it, most likely searching for illegal items (e.g. narcotics) that might be transported inside the beach ball. The guards may also do this so that the beach ball cannot end up on the field and obstruct or distract players, as happened in August 1999, in a baseball game between the Cleveland Indians and the Los Angeles Angels, where the distraction caused by a beach ball on the field resulted in the Angels' defeat.\n\nTheir light weight and stability make beach balls ideal for trained seals to balance on their noses, which has become an iconic scene. Beach balls are also a popular prop used in swimsuit photography and to promote or represent beach-themed events or locations.\n\n"}

Boldenone itself has never been marketed; as a pharmaceutical drug, it is used as boldenone undecylenate, the undecylenate ester.\n\nLike other AAS, boldenone is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). The activity of boldenone is mainly anabolic, with a low androgenic potency. Boldenone will increase nitrogen retention, protein synthesis, increases appetite and stimulates the release of erythropoietin in the kidneys. Boldenone was synthesized in an attempt to create a long-acting injectable metandienone, for androgen deficiency disorders. Boldenone acts similar to metandienone with fewer adverse androgenic effects. Although commonly compared to nandrolone, boldenone lacks progesterone receptor interaction and associated progestogenic side effects.\n\nBoldenone, also known as Δ-testosterone, 1-dehydrotestosterone, or androsta-1,4-dien-17β-ol-3-one, is a naturally occurring androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically testosterone with a double bond between the C1 and C2 positions. A related compound is quinbolone, the 17-cyclopentenyl enol ether of boldenone.\n\nBoldenone occurs naturally in the scent gland of \"Ilybius fenestratus\", a species of aquatic beetle.\n\nCiba reportedly patented boldenone in 1949. It subsequently developed several experimental esters of the drug in the 1950s and 1960s. One of these was boldenone undecylenate, which was introduced for clinical use under the brand name Parenabol and saw some use in the late 1960s and early 1970s. However, it was discontinued before the end of the 1970s.

This is also where the track announcer entertained and informed the spectators of the action. All this was considered 'New Technology\" in 1961.

After this initial exposure to the Tongan people several clubs began to form or switch from rugby union to rugby league and by 1988 the nation had enough depth in their player pool to begin playing national fixtures and would decide to enter the 1988 Pacific Cup competition held in neighbouring Samoa in their capital Apia.\n\nDuring that Pacific Cup the Tongans would play in three fixtures winning a sole match against the American Samoans 38-14 that would double as their first international victory; the team would however fail to win their other two matches against Western Samoa 40-30 and the New Zealand Maori 42-16.\n\nOver the next two years the national side sporadically played international fixtures but it would not be until the 1992 Pacific Cup when they would again begin playing with some regularity. At the 1992 Cup competition the side would show significant improvement on their previous inaugural cup effort with victories over Niue, Cook Islands, Fiji and the New Zealand Maori. This run of victories would earn them a place in the final of the 1992 Pacific Cup against the Western Samoan side but they would eventually lose a close fought match by four points 18-14. The following tournament two years later would see the Tongan side show further improvement with several comfortable victories again earning them a spot in final of the Pacific Cup this time against the Fijians who had never defeated the Tongans at that time. The final would be a tough affair but the \"Mate Ma'a\" would again be victorious over Fiji 34-11 and would claim their maiden Pacific Cup title.\n\nDuring 1995 Tonga qualified for their first World Cup that year and were seeded in the strong group B with both New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. While Tonga failed to win a match at the World Cup they earned copious amounts of respect after they only narrowly lost to the New Zealand team by a single point and earn a draw against Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe next four years saw the Tongan side appear in a further Pacific Cup in 1997 and then qualify for the 2000 World Cup with comfortable victories over the Cook Islands, Tokelau and American Samoa. Prior to appearing at the 2000 competition the Tongans arranged a friendly fixture against the New Zealand side that they had come so close to defeating during the previous World Cup but this time sustained their heaviest defeat to date going down 74-0 and suffering a large dent in confidence prior to the competition.\n\nAfter the heavy defeat to New Zealand their next international fixture would be during their second World Cup where the Tongans would again be placed in another tough group with France, Papua New Guinea again and the South Africans. Tonga would face South Africa in their first match of the tournament where they would be comfortable victors in a 66-18 drubbing, however the rest of the tournament would not be so kind to the Tongan side with losses to both France and Papua New Guinea meaning the Tongans would again fail to make it past the first stage of the tournament.\n\nWith a disappointing World Cup behind them the \"Mate Ma'a\" regrouped and again entered the Pacific Cup four years later in 2004. The tournament saw the Tongans again qualify for the tournament final with victories over both the Cook Islands and Fiji but the side would suffer a heavy defeat at the hands of neighbouring Samoa 51-18. 2006 saw the Tongan side re-enter the Pacific Cup where again they performed strongly qualifying for their second consecutive final where this time they reversed their previous effort with a strong victory over Fiji 22-4 giving them their second Pacific Cup title.\n\n2006 would continue to be a busy year of international fixtures for the Tongans which saw them gain qualification into the 2008 World Cup after they would finish top of their Pacific group ahead of the Cook Islands, Fiji and Samoa and then defeat the Samoans 18-10 in the qualifying final. They would also enter the inaugural Federation Shield competition along with England, France and Samoa and eventually finish second to the English in a tough final which would eventually end 32-14 and saw several Tongan players sin binned. During the tournament they also achieved a good victory over neighbouring Samoa and a surprising victory over the French that also saw them take their fourth place world ranking.\n\nThe Tongan war cry, the Sipi Tau is accompanied by a traditional dance similar in style to the New Zealand Haka.\n\nMate Ma'a Tonga War Cry\n\nHii\nMate Ma'a Tonga War Cry (FULL)\n\n\n"}

It is the largest sailing event in the world, and also one of the largest Volksfeste in Germany, attracting millions of people every year from all over Germany and neighbouring countries.\nKiel Week is held annually in the last week in June, and opens officially on the preceding Saturday with the official \"Glasen\", followed by the \"Holstenbummel\". The \"Soundcheck\" is on the Friday before the official opening; it is a music festival across all the stages within the city. Kiel Week ends with a large fireworks display at 11 p.m. on Sunday, fired from pontoons or the quays at the Howaldtswerke, visible all across the Bay of Kiel.\n\nMost ship races begin at the Olympic Harbor of Schilksee, also the center of most sporting activities during Kiel Week. As Schilksee is located outside of the inner city and most sailing competitions take place yet further out, only some races - mainly of smaller boat types - can be viewed from shore, namely from along the Kiellinie at the west coast of the Bay of Kiel.\n\nKiel Week usually gathers around 5,000 sailors, 2,000 ships, and about three million visitors each year. The event is organized in joint effort by the Yacht Club of Kiel, the Norddeutscher Regattaverein, the Hamburger Sailing Club, and the Verein Seglerhaus am Wannsee.\n\nWhile Kiel Week started out as a ship racing championship, it has long since become a large festival with many popular bands playing on public stages. They often play for free, although the corporate sponsors (many from the Schleswig-Holstein media and telecommunications industry) usually display their involvement prominently. Most of the stages can be found at the Kiellinie (the western side of the Kieler Förde from the Düsternbrook yacht harbor past the Schleswig-Holstein parliament building to the big inner city ferry harbor), and as of late, across the Hoernbridge to the Germania harbor and the Hörn. Another area of rich cultural activity is the city center (Rathausplatz, Holstenbrücke) and the area connecting the city center with the ferry harbor (Alter Markt, Dänische Straße, Schloßpark). Between the public stages and especially on the \"International Market\" on the Rathausplatz, food specialties from different countries can be eaten. Small street performances and street comedy are performed in many places. A special children's program is available at the \"Spiellinie\".\n\nKiel Week is also one of the largest tall ship conventions in Germany, attracting many German and international traditional ships, mainly sailing ships. Many of them spend the week doing day tours out of Kiel, thus berthing much more in view of the festival visitors than the racing boats at Kiel-Schilksee. More than 100 traditional ships and hundreds of yachts usually participate in the Tall Ships Parade (\"Windjammer‎parade\") on the day before the closing day of the Kiel Week, i.e. usually on the second Saturday of Kiel Week. The Parade was first held in 1972, under the name of \"Operation Sail\", and was organized in celebration of the Olympic Summer Games in Germany that year, whose sailing competitions took place in Kiel. It was the first large gathering of tall ships since the time of the windjammers, and its success led to the annual Parade and to the foundation of the first sail training organization in Germany (Clipper DJS). Today, the Parade is often headed by the \"Gorch Fock\", a sister ship to the German-built \"USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)\".\n\nSince 1948, advertises an annual Kiel Week poster for the festival week.

Based on the 1960 novel of the same name by David Storey, which won the 1960 Macmillan Fiction Award, it recounts the story of a rugby league footballer, Frank Machin, in Wakefield, a mining town in Yorkshire, whose romantic life is not as successful as his sporting life. Storey, a former professional rugby league footballer, also wrote the screenplay.\n\nThe film stars Richard Harris, Rachel Roberts, William Hartnell and Alan Badel. The film was Harris's first starring role, and won him the Best Actor Award at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. He was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Roberts won her second BAFTA award for \"This Sporting Life\" and an Oscar nomination for best actress. Harris was nominated for the BAFTA that year as well. The film opened at the Odeon Leicester Square in London's West End on 7 February 1963.\n\nSet in Wakefield, the film concerns Frank Machin (Harris) a bitter young coal miner from the West Riding of Yorkshire. Following a nightclub altercation, in which he takes on the captain of the local rugby league club and punches a couple of the others, he is recruited by the team's manager, who sees profit in his aggressive streak.\n\nAlthough at first somewhat uncoordinated at league, he impresses the team's owner, Gerald Weaver (Badel), with the spirit and brutality of his playing style during the trial. He is signed up to the top team as a loose forward (number 13) and impresses all with his aggressive forward play. He often punches or elbows the opposing players.\n\nOff the field, Frank is much less successful. His recently widowed landlady, Mrs Margaret Hammond (Roberts), a mother of two young children, lost her husband in an accident at Weaver's engineering firm but received no financial compensation, because the death was ruled a suicide. Frank eventually has sexual relations with Margaret but in her grief she cannot return any affection. She sometimes insults him, referring to him as \"just a great ape\" and finds his boorish behaviour at a smart restaurant off-putting. He is occasionally violent towards her. He leaves and stays at a homeless men's shelter after a row over her late husband. He has another quarrel with Weaver and his predatory wife, whose advances he rejects much to her chagrin. Intending a reconciliation with Margaret, he finds that she is in a hospital. She is unconscious, having suffered a brain haemorrhage shortly after their split and she dies without regaining consciousness. In the end he is seen as \"just a great ape on a football field\", vulnerable to the ravages of time and injury.\n\nThis was Anderson's first feature film as director, although he had won an Oscar for his short documentary, \"Thursday's Children\" (1954), one of the documentaries he had made in the previous decade. The project had first been discussed by The Rank Organisation as a possible project for Joseph Losey and then Karel Reisz who, reluctant to direct another film with a similar setting and theme to \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\" (1960) suggested that Lindsay Anderson direct it with himself serving as producer.\n\nAmong the supporting cast is William Hartnell, who shortly afterwards began his role as \"Doctor Who\". It was his role in \"This Sporting Life\" that brought Hartnell to the attention of \"Doctor Who\" producer Verity Lambert. The film also features Arthur Lowe, later to star in \"Dad's Army\", who appeared in four later films directed by Anderson.\n\nMany of the scenes in \"This Sporting Life\" were filmed at Wakefield Trinity's stadium, Belle Vue and at the Halifax stadium Thrum Hall. The scene where Frank (Richard Harris) leaps from a bus to buy a newspaper, then leaps back onto the bus was filmed at the top of Westgate, Wakefield. The location is still instantly recognisable and has changed little in the decades since. The houses used for filming the outdoor scenes in \"This Sporting Life\" were in Servia Terrace in Leeds. The riverside location where Frank takes the family for an outing in his new car is Bolton Abbey in the Yorkshire Dales.\n\nAnthony Sloman wrote\n\nA description of the editing says\n\nAnderson wrote in his diary on 23 April 1962, after the first month or so of production, \"the most striking feature of it all, I suppose, has been the splendour and misery of my work and relationship with Richard\". He felt that Harris was acting better than ever before in his career, but feared his feelings for Harris, whose combination of physicality, affection and cruelty fascinated him, meant that he lacked the detachment he needed as a director. \"I ought to be calm and detached with him. Instead I am impulsive, affectionate, infinitely susceptible.\"\n\nThe response from critics was favourable. In the United States, copy from the Reuters news agency described it as being praised unanimously by the critics for New York City publications. \"Variety\" praised its \"gutsy vitality\" and praised the production of Reisz and the directorial feature début of Anderson, who \"brings the keen, observant eye of a documentary man to many vivid episodes without sacrificing the story line\".\n\nHowever, on first release the film was a commercial flop with British audiences, and did not recoup its cost. The Chairman of the Rank Organisation, John Davis, announced that the company would not venture further with \"kitchen sink\" film projects. Nor would his company make such a \"squalid\" film again. More generally, it ended producers willingness to back such British New Wave films.\n\nJohn Russell Taylor in 1980 thought it a mistake to link \"This Sporting Life\" with the \"kitchen sink\" films released in the preceding few years, because its \"emotionalism\" made it \"unique\", apart from Anderson's other work\n\nOn 22 January 2008, the film was released as a Region 1 DVD by The Criterion Collection.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1836579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1836579", "title": "Up the Down Steroid", "text": "Up the Down Steroid\n\n\"Up the Down Steroid\" is the second episode in the eighth season of the American animated television series \"South Park\". It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 24, 2004. In the episode, Jimmy enters the special Olympics but starts using steroids to improve his performance. Cartman, believing he will have an advantage over the other children, disguises himself as handicapped so he can enter and win the cash prize. The title of the episode is a parody of the book \"Up the Down Staircase\".\n\nTimmy and Jimmy, two disabled children in South Park, are eager to participate in the Special Olympics in Denver. Cartman decides to fake being disabled and attempt to beat all the handicapped children in the events to win the $1,000 prize. Jimmy is talked into taking steroids by Nathan to increase his chances of winning. He manages to keep his use of it a secret from everyone except for Timmy (who discovers the drugs after he accidentally dropped the bag and spilling the contents). While Timmy frowns on this, being unable to say anything other than his name and Jimmy's name, he is unable to explain the situation to the school counselor Mr. Mackey.\n\nJimmy begins to neglect his girlfriend and studies as a result of his steroid use. When his girlfriend grows tired of neglect and announces she is leaving him, Jimmy flies into a steroid rage and savagely attacks his girlfriend and mother. Kyle repeatedly tries to talk Cartman out of his plans but is ignored. At the Special Olympics, the prizes are given by Mark McGwire, Jason Giambi and Barry Bonds. Jimmy sets multiple records and is declared the winner. Cartman, on the other hand, is so out-of-shape that his plan fails miserably when the more athletic handicapped contestants beat him; he nevertheless wins a \"spirit award\" - consisting of a gift voucher - for coming last. When he goes to collect the prize, Jimmy recognizes Cartman and is about to attack him, but Timmy intervenes, and Jimmy realises that he is just as much of a cheater himself. Jimmy confesses his drug use to the crowd and returns his medal, asking for his records to be cancelled and that people who use steroids are \"pussies\" (all the while the camera focuses on McGwire, Giambi, and Bonds during his speech). The people give Jimmy a standing ovation for being honest, and he says he will be back next year. Cartman then claims to Stan and Kyle that he pretended to be handicapped in order for Jimmy to learn his lesson, but Stan and Kyle don't buy his lies; in anger, Cartman calls them \"assholes\" and tells them to \"grow up\".\n\nThere was some controversy surrounding \"Up the Down Steroid\" and the 2005 film \"The Ringer\", as both feature the same plot: someone pretending to be disabled in order to compete in the Special Olympics. \"The Ringer\" was written and filmed months before this episode was aired, although, \"The Ringer\" was not released to the public until after this episode aired. According to the episode's DVD audio commentary, series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not think that they ripped off \"The Ringer\", since the idea to them did not seem hard to come up with, and they did not even think it was big enough for a twenty-minute episode let alone a two-hour film. In the opening scene, the boys are playing the same \"Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis\" funtime game as they did in the season four episode \"Cartman Joins NAMBLA\".\n\nThe episode's title refers to the 1964 young adult novel \"Up the Down Staircase\", by Bel Kaufman, which was adapted into a film in 1967 starring Sandy Dennis. Trey Parker admitted he had to perform this story in a high school play and hated it. Stone admitted in the commentary that he once pretended to be disabled to get into Six Flags Magic Mountain for half price.\n\n\"Up the Down Steroid\", along with the thirteen other episodes from \"South Park\"s eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.\n\n"}
