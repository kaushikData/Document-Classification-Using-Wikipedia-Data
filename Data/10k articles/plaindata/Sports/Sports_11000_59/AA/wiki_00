By applying shaking forces the shaker can emulate banking loads, lateral load transfer, longitudinal weight transfer and ride height sensitive downforce to emulate specific racetracks.\n\nThe 7 post shaker is used for many vehicles in different driving conditions. Earlier versions were the 5 post shaker and the 4 post shaker. The 4 post shaker is commonly used by vehicle manufacturers to investigate squeaks and rattles. Manufacturers do not normally use a 7 post rig for road cars because these vehicles are not normally subject to the same aerodynamic effects as a race car operating at high speeds. This technology was first used in Formula 1 in the late 1990s, and is now also used by other series such as NASCAR and the Indy Racing League. NASCAR teams with 7 post rigs include Hendrick Motorsports, Richard Childress Racing, Chip Ganassi Racing, Furniture Row Racing, and Roush Fenway Racing. The car driven by Jeff Gordon is shown on a 7 post rig in this video.\n\nVehicle designers use the results of the testing on the 7 post shaker to adjust spring rates, shock valving and steering ratio to best suit conditions of a specific emulated track.\n\nThe 7 post shaker places forces on a vehicle and records the forces that the vehicle puts back into the system. The 7 post applies lift, downforce, road irregularity forces and load transfer due to braking, acceleration and cornering. The vehicle suspension and drivetrain components respond to these forces, chassis and suspension frequency oscillations (under 30 Hz), and tire, engine, transmission and drive axle vibrations at higher frequencies. The forces applied are calculated from a model of the racetrack, the weight of the car and driver, tire pressure, engine RPM, and driveline RPM. The forces that the testing engineers want are placed on the car through the use of four main hydraulic actuators capable of generating of force with a maximum velocity in excess of that act on the tires. While the actuators are capable of producing frequencies as high as 500 Hz, this is not necessary as the elasticity of the rubber and air in the tires will absorb most inputs above 50 Hz. The remaining three posts are known as aeroloader actuators, and are responsible for the sprung mass of the vehicle. The forces that these three actuators represent are inertial loads that come from entering a curve or aerodynamic loading and unloading in the form of downforce or lift from a wing. These forces are small on road cars where speeds are not normally greater than , but are significant on a race car where speeds can exceed .\n\nThe very basic parameters that need to be initialized are the vertical input forces to the vehicle from the road surface. The drivers and engineers want to look at how the car reacts to specific tracks, as the car will respond differently at the tri oval at Talladega Superspeedway where speeds can approach than Bristol Motor Speedway where the corners are banked 24 to 30 degrees. This data is extremely hard to collect and assemble as the road surface is highly irregular. Once a racetrack is loaded into the testing computer, the vehicle can be loaded onto the 7 post, in the absence of actual track data swept-sine waves can be used. Further variables are eliminated by using ballast for the weight of the driver and the weight of the fuel in the tank. The test lab temperature is highly regulated to standard temperature of . Once the unit is started transducers in the form of accelerometers and strain gauges, convert the mechanical movement of the vehicle into an electrical signal. This signal is sent to a processor which converts and amplifies the signal, and sends it on to the computer.\n\nAlso of particular interest to the engineer is the force between the tire and the road. This is of interest to the car designer because it reflects the grip that the tire has on the road surface. This is more difficult to test because the sampling frequency has to be at least five times as high as the highest frequency. In this case the incoming frequency is 100 Hz, so the sampling frequency must be at least 500 Hz.\n\nIn vibration analysis, as in all engineering problems, the output data must be looked at in a methodical way. When testing on the 7 post shaker, all variables are inter-related and can be analyzed while the effects of the actual installation can be quantified. The damping force curve can be extracted from the data to understand how installation stiffness and other variables affect the damping force. Some seemingly unimportant trends need to be verified so the engineers can be sure that the trend will not continue or that the trend is expected.\n\nThe analysis path in this case is:\n\n\n"}

Cage balls typically have a diameter of 48\" or 60\", though 72\" diameter models are available. The inventor of the cage ball is Doctor Emmett Dunn Angell.\n\nPhysical education teachers will make many uses of cage balls, but perhaps the most common use is to employ it in a pseudo-soccer game. Because of its size, the ball is virtually impossible to dribble downfield, and students simply push against it with their bodies, often with several children climbing on the ball at once. As normally inflated, the ball yields easily to pressure. Some teachers use a rule under which children are permitted only to use their legs and not kick the ball. Cage balls are also used in \"cooperative games\".\nCage balls are often used to play crab soccer in American schools.\n\nCage balls have an internal rubber bladder to contain the air. The outside is sometimes vinyl, though for many years the covering was only made of canvas. Although spherical (when not being pushed), the cage ball shares the American football's \"laces\", which hold the bladder in.\n\nIn addition to pseudo-soccer, there is also Omnikin, a Canadian game.

{"id": "1437871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1437871", "title": "Cori cycle", "text": "Cori cycle\n\nThe Cori cycle (also known as the Lactic acid cycle), named after its discoverers, Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Cori, refers to the metabolic pathway in which lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis in the muscles moves to the liver and is converted to glucose, which then returns to the muscles and is metabolized back to lactate.\n\nMuscular activity requires ATP, which is provided by the breakdown of glycogen in the skeletal muscles. The breakdown of glycogen, a process known as glycogenolysis, releases glucose in the form of glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P). The G-1-P is converted to G-6-P by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. G-6-P is readily fed into glycolysis, (or can go into the pentose phosphate pathway if G-6-P concentration is high) a process that provides ATP to the muscle cells as an energy source. During muscular activity, the store of ATP needs to be constantly replenished. When the supply of oxygen is sufficient, this energy comes from feeding pyruvate, one product of glycolysis, into the Krebs cycle.\n\nWhen oxygen supply is insufficient, typically during intense muscular activity, energy must be released through anaerobic metabolism. Lactic acid fermentation converts pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Most importantly, fermentation regenerates NAD, maintaining the NAD concentration so that additional glycolysis reactions can occur. The fermentation step oxidizes the NADH produced by glycolysis back to NAD, transferring two electrons from NADH to reduce pyruvate into lactate. (Refer to the main articles on glycolysis and fermentation for the details.)\n\nInstead of accumulating inside the muscle cells, lactate produced by anaerobic fermentation is taken up by the liver. This initiates the other half of the Cori cycle. In the liver, gluconeogenesis occurs. From an intuitive perspective, gluconeogenesis reverses both glycolysis and fermentation by converting lactate first into pyruvate, and finally back to glucose. The glucose is then supplied to the muscles through the bloodstream; it is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. If muscle activity has stopped, the glucose is used to replenish the supplies of glycogen through glycogenesis.\n\nOverall, the glycolysis part of the cycle produces 2 ATP molecules at a cost of 6 ATP molecules consumed in the gluconeogenesis part. Each iteration of the cycle must be maintained by a net consumption of 4 ATP molecules. As a result, the cycle cannot be sustained indefinitely. The intensive consumption of ATP molecules indicates that the Cori cycle shifts the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liver.\n\nThe cycle's importance is based on the prevention of lactic acidosis in the muscle under anaerobic conditions. However, normally before this happens the lactic acid is moved out of the muscles and into the liver.\n\nThe cycle is also important in producing ATP, an energy source, during muscle activity. The Cori cycle functions more efficiently when muscle activity has ceased. This allows the oxygen debt to be repaid such that the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain can produce energy at peak efficiency.\n\nThe Cori cycle is a much more important source of substrate for gluconeogenesis than food. The contribution of Cori cycle lactate to overall glucose production increases with fasting duration before plateauing. Specifically, after 12, 20, and 40 hours of fasting by human volunteers, gluconeogenesis accounts for 41%, 71%, and 92% of glucose production, but the contribution of Cori cycle lactate to gluconeogenesis is 18%, 35%, and 36%, respectively. The remaining glucose production comes from protein breakdown, muscle glycogen, and glycerol from lipolysis.\n\nThe drug metformin can cause lactic acidosis in patients with renal failure because metformin inhibits the hepatic gluconeogenesis of the Cori cycle, particularly the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1. The buildup of lactate and its substrates for lactate production, pyruvate and alanine, lead to excess lactate. Normally, the excess lactate would be cleared by the kidneys, but in patients with renal failure, the kidneys cannot handle the excess lactic acid.\n\n\n"}

The story recounted in Il Puttino must have occurred around 1575, thus, published by Salvio some 60 years later. \"Il Puttino, altramente detto il Cavaliere errante\" is a nickname used by Alessandro Salvio for Giovanni Leonardo. According to Alessandro Salvio, Giulio Cesare da Lanciano accompanied Giovanni Leonardo on his way to Madrid until Genoa.\n\nAfter returning to Rome around 1584, Polerio became a chess player and writer in ordinary of Giacomo Boncompagni, Duke of Sora and son of Pope Gregory XIII (born Ugo Boncompagni).\n\nPolerio wrote a number of codexes in which a lively international chess is described (exchanges of ideas among Italy, Portugal, and Spain). In these codexes, besides of own and new ideas in chess openings, some matches played by himself are noted by the hand of Polerio.\n\nIn the Puttino, Salvio mentions that, starting in 1606 from \"Città di Piazza\", after a long travel on his way to Rome (p. 43) ... (p. 44: \"il detto Signor Cascio poi andando a Roma, vinse Giulio Cesare compagno del Puttino il primo a Roma, in casa dell'Eccelenza del Sig. Giacobo Buoncompagno Duca di Sora\") this Mr. Geronimo Cascio, on his way to Rome, beat Giulio Cesare (Polerio), companion of Il Puttino, the best in Rome, in the house/court of his Excellence Giacomo Boncompagni, Duke of Sora.\n\nThe first systematic investigation of the Codexes of Polerio was published by Antonius van der Linde in 1874. The subject of the investigations by Van der Linde can be found at the Bibliotheca Van der Linde-Niemeijeriana, part of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands.\n\nThe current systematics of the Codexes of Polerio has been performed and published by Alessandro Sanvito in 2005.\n\nThe systematic organisation of overall seven Codexes, described and called A-G by Van der Linde, and attributed to Polerio in 1874, had major impact on the further description of chess history, and history of chess theory. A relevant part of the work of Van der Linde was to compare Codexes of Polerio and Gioacchino Greco even superfine. According to this investigation, most of the analytic work of Polerio was mediated outside of Italy, up to 1874, via Gioacchino Greco. The clue, which potentially could link both chess players, may be seen in the person Giacomo Boncompagni, or the Duchy of Sora respectively.\n\nOn p. 186 of \"Das Schachspiel des XVI. Jahrhunderts\" van der Linde wrote in 1874:\n\n\"D. Polerio-Gambit\n\n224\n\n1. e2-e4 e7-e5\n2. f2-f4 e5-f4:\n3. Sg1-f3 g7-g5\n4. Lf1-c4 g5-g4\n5. 0-0! g4-f3:\n6. Dd1-f3: \"e cosi ancor che habbia perso un pezzo resta con buonissima postura di poter uencere il gioco sapendo guidarlo à presso, il che sarebbe superfluo inogni modo se si uolesse mostrare la fine di tutti giochi, e per questo basta insino à un certo che, tanto che si conosca apartemente il uantagio del gioco, si come per la postura di dette giochi ogni giudicioso giocatore lo potrà facilmente cognoscere\".\")\n\n... in modern terms:\n\n\"Polerio Gambit: 1. e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0! gxf3 6.Qxf3 +/-\"\n\nExactly this move order was also found later even in a second Polerio Codex discovered and described by J.A. Leon in 1894.\nOf note is that the position after 1. e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Qxf3 may be considered by most recent grandmasters as a forced win for White - provided that 5.0-0 would mean \"free castling\", i.e. bringing the White King from e1 to h1. Actually, Polerio did claim 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Qxf3 to be favourable for White although the White King of Polerio did stand, after 5.0-0, on h1 but not on g1 (i.e. castling as defined in our days).\n\nHowever, in 1874, the move order 1. e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0! was already occupied by the term \"Muzio Gambit\". This term derives from a translation of a work of Alessandro Salvio, supposedly the third book of the reprint of 1723, by Sarrat in 1813. On page 209 Jacob Henry Sarratt (translated) and wrote:\n\n\"SALVIO states that the following Gambit was sent to him by Signor Muzio, ...\"\n\nActually, Alessandro Salvio never stated this. Rather, in the third book of the Il Puttino he wrote that Signor Mutio d'Alessandro did see that Geronimo Cascio did play the move order (with free castling, also called \"Italian method\" of castling).\n\nWith p. 165, vol. 2, of the 1821 edition of A New Treatise of the Game of Chess the term Muzio Gambit was coined by Jacob Henry Sarratt. And with the latter work of Sarrat, in 1821 the modern theory of the \"Muzio Gambit\" with castling according modern rules started - an idea and a position already Polerio analysed in 1579/80.\n\nThus, Antonius van der Linde, changed the view on the historical development of the move order 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 in 1874, most notably in the last editions of the Handbuch. Thereafter, a trend can be seen to call this move order either with hyphenated terms such as Muzio-Polerio, Polerio-Muzio, or simply Polerio Gambit. Such a terminology is both in honour of Giulio Cesare Polerio and partially misleading since the major body of the theory of this opening was generated in the time span in-between 1821 and 1874. The number of games played by Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy, and Wilhelm Steinitz with 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 or 5.d4 in the time span 1821-1874 was already rather high. The rules for Chess opening nomenclature, and their historical development, should be taken into account while assessing van der Linde's claim of 1874 \"D. Polerio-Gambit\".\n\nIn 1874, Van der Linde suggested as well (p. 188) to rename the move order 1. e4 e5 2. f4 ef 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 Bg7 5.h4 h6 6.d4 d6 7.Nc3 e6 8.hg hg 9.Rxh8 Bxh8 10.Ne5 into \"Polerio's second Gambit\". This suggestion is based on the observation that \"im Handbuch (1864, S.. 366, § 3)\" this move order is called \"das Gambit des Calabresen\". This is a rather interesting observation since in the \"Handbuch\" in its 2nd edition as of 1852, on p. 205 it is mentioned that the move order 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 f5 can be found \"at the Calabrese\". That's a rather wise wording since both 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 f5 and 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5, according to Codexes of Polerio, occurred in games of \"Gio. Leonardo\" (games 236-238, p. 190 in van der Linde). Both Giovanni Leonardo and Gioacchino Greco derived from Calabria, the first from Cutro, the second from Celico(?).\n\n"}

Slindon, featuring Richard Newland, won \"almost in one innings\". \n\nIn 1762 there is another Guildford reference at Merrow Down with the Guildford club losing by two runs to Chertsey.\n\nThe first actual reference to Guildford Bason is the game played 31 July – 1 August 1769 between Caterham and Hambledon. Hambledon won by 4 wickets thanks to \"the batting of Messrs Small and Bayton\". \n\nSussex lawyer John Baker, a regular spectator at Georgian matches, described some of them in his diary. One is the All-England v Hampshire game in July 1772 which Baker attended with his parson friend, John Woodward. He writes that Hambledon was already batting when they arrived. It was a cheerful scene and \"the Basin on Merrow Down\" was ringed by a big crowd of spectators, most of them standing. Indeed, contemporary paintings of matches show no sign of seating accommodation for the ordinary folk. The local publicans were doing good business in their booths, some of them rented by the local nobility and thus the equivalent of the present-day sponsors’ tents or boxes. As in our own times, the occupants were often more interested in the food and drink than in the cricket. Guildford had fixed up a small grandstand \"with benches above one another over his booth below\", but it was already full. Baker then talks about \"finding a small booth where we had a good cold dinner and good cider and ale\". He says this was better and cheaper than the one they had on the following day in the \"White Hart\" booth.\n\nThe last known use of Guildford Bason for a first-class match is the All-England v Hampshire match in August 1777. This produced a tense finish with Hampshire scoring 162-9 in the last innings to win by 1 wicket. Tom Taylor scored 62 and it required several runs by the last pair (Tom Sueter and Richard Nyren) to secure the win with Lumpy bowling to them.\n\n\n"}

It is named after the first Prime Minister of India. It is a 60,000 seat stadium, designed and constructed to meet the international standards for stadiums set by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). In terms of seating capacity, it is the fourth largest stadium in India, 27th largest stadium in Asia and the 103rd largest stadium in the world.\n\nThe Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was constructed by the Government of India to host the athletic events and ceremonies of the 1982 Asian Games. It also hosted the 1989 Asian Championships in Athletics. The stadium was renovated for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, hosting the track and field events and opening and closing ceremonies. The cost of the renovation was around US$150 million, making it as the most expensive stadium ever built in India and South Asia. \n\nThe stadium was redesigned by the German architectural companies Gerkan, Marg and Partners and Schlaich Bergermann & Partner. The stadium is a part of the Jawaharlal Nehru sports complex which houses the headquarters of the Sports Authority of India, the field arm of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and Indian Olympic Association.\n\nThe stadium is used by the Indian national football team for international competition and Indian Athletics. Since 2014, It has also been the home ground of the Indian Super League football club Delhi Dynamos. The stadium hosted some matches of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. The stadium can also hold concerts with up to 100,000 spectators, and due to its oval shape, it is suitable to host other sporting events such as cricket.\n\nThe Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was constructed by the Government of India to host the 1982 Asian Games. A total of 3,411 athletes from 33 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these games, competing in 196 events in 21 sports and 23 disciplines. This was the first Asian Games to be held under the aegis of the Olympic Council of Asia. The stadium hosted the athletic events and opening and closing ceremonies. The capacity of the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was 78,000 during the games.\n\nThe stadium also hosted the 1989 Asian Championships in Athletics. 19 nations participated in the championships.\n\nDelhi was selected as the host city of the 2010 Commonwealth Games on 14 November 2003 during the CGF General Assembly in Montego Bay, Jamaica, defeating bid from Hamilton, Canada. In 2006, the Indian government decided to renovate the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium for the Commonwealth Games. \n\nThe Indian government chose the design of the German architectural company Gerkan, Marg and Partners. Renovation of the stadium started in 2007. Nearly 4,000 construction workers worked on the stadium in double shifts. The remodelled stadium was inaugurated on 27 July 2010. The stadium was given a new roof, improved seating, and other facilities to meet international standards as it hosts the athletic events and the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. The capacity of the stadium was reduced from 78,000 to 60,254. The cost of the renovation was around US$150 million (₹961 crores).\n\nThe 53,800 m² Teflon-coated roof, designed by the German structural engineering and consulting firm Schlaich Bergermann & Partner, was built at a cost of US$48 million (₹308 crores). Taiyo Membrane Corporation supplied and installed the PTFE glass fibre fabric roof. It is the one of the largest membrane roof system in the world. 8,500 tonnes of steel were used in the construction of the stadium's roof and its support structure. The support structure for the new roof is similar to London's Olympic Stadium. In case of emergency, the construction allows spectators to evacuate within 6 minutes.\n\nA new Electro-Voice professional audio system by Bosch Communications was set up in the stadium. A new 10-lane synthetic track, synthetic warm-up track, and a synthetic lawn ball field were added. A 400-metre warm-up track was also constructed. A 150 metre long tunnel was constructed for the opening and closing ceremonies. The design is similar to Foshan Stadium in China, built by the same designers. \n\nTwo new venues were constructed next to the stadium for the Games: four synthetic greens for the lawn bowls event and a 2,500-seat gymnasium for the weightlifting event. The stadium is a part of the Jawaharlal Nehru sports complex which houses the headquarters of the Sports Authority of India, the field arm of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and Indian Olympic Association.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru Stadium was the main venue for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. It hosted the opening and closing ceremonies as well as athletics events for the games. The stadium underwent massive redesign and reconstruction for the biggest multi-sport event hosted by India to that date. It was opened to the general public on 27 July 2010.\n\nIn July 2010, the first-ever Asian All Asian Athletics Championship was held. Over 1,500 students from schools came to see the event. The opening ceremony of the 2010 Commonwealth Games has been held. Security for the ceremony used NSG, CRPF and Delhi police personnel. Tickets were checked by electronic ticket checking machine similar to the ones used in the Delhi Metro. There are over 350 CCTV cameras in the venue. Delhi was closed, in the sense that all the malls, shops, offices, and call-centers in Delhi were closed before and during the ceremony.\n\nI League matches have also been played here. The stadium was the main venue for the 2011 South Asian Football Federation Cup.\n\nOn 10 January 2012, the Government of India, and Audi, co-hosted a friendly football exhibition match between the Indian National Football Team and Bayern Munich at Jawaharlal Nehru stadium. In this one-sided affair, the German club has defeated Indian team by 4-0 in front of 30,000 spectators. This was the farewell match to Baichung Bhutia as Indian National Football Team captain.\n\nSince 2014 Indian Super League season, it has been home ground for Delhi Dynamos FC.\n\nThe stadium hosted 8 matches (including 2 Round of 16 matches) of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup.\n\nAt the end of 2017–18 Indian Super League season, the football pitch in the stadium was named as \"Best Pitch\" in the league by ISL itself.\n\nThe Indian team will play its home matches in the Nehru Stadium after it was handed over by Sports Ministry to the AIFF. India's first match in the new stadium was to be played against UAE in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification play-off in July 2011. However, this match was shifted to Ambedkar Stadium because of the unplayable conditions at the Nehru stadium. The 2011 SAFF Cup was held here from 2 - 11 Dec 2011, with the Indian team emerging victorious. The 2012 Nehru Cup was held from 23 August to 2 September at this venue.\n\nThe stadium played host to Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! Benefit Concert on 30 September 1988. The show was headlined by Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, and also featured Sting and Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, Youssou N'Dour, and Ravi Shankar.\n\nThe project was led and managed by Mr. Ramji Lal from CPWD.\n\nMichael Jackson was scheduled to perform 2 concerts at the stadium in December 1993 as a part of his Dangerous World Tour. Some tickets were also sold. This would have been the first time Jackson would have performed in India. MTV India and other T.V. channels played Jackson's music videos months before the concert which created mass hysteria and anticipation in the public for the concerts and Jackson's visit to India. \nBoth the concerts were expected to be sold out. These two concerts were scheduled to be the last performances of the tour. Unfortunately the concerts in Delhi along with the dates for Indonesia and Australia were cancelled due to Jackson's health problems.\n\nThe Stadium has hosted two One Day International matches featuring India against Australia in 1984 which incidentally, was the first day night one day international in India. and South Africa in 1991, again the fixture being a day night one (also being the second ever day-night cricket match in India) . Batsman Kepler Wessels played in both the matches but for different countries and scored 107 for Australia and 90 for South Africa.\n\nA special feature of the ground was the running track being used as a part of the cricket playing area, which the ICC playing regulations eventually discontinued and thus the stadium was felt no longer suitable for cricket.\n\n"}

{"id": "5348646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5348646", "title": "Kennington Common", "text": "Kennington Common\n\nKennington Common was a large area of common land mainly within the London Borough of Lambeth. The area was notable for being one of the earliest venues for cricket within London and top-class matches were played there from 1724 to 1785. The common was also used for public executions, fairs and public gatherings.\n\nIn 1600, the common was bounded on the south west by Vauxhall Creek. It extended over marshy land to the south west of the Roman road called Stane Street, now Kennington Park Road. There is a 1660 record of a common keeper being paid for grazing. In 1661, the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens were laid out nearby (its location is noted as the Vauxhall End at The Oval). The large open space was often used for a variety of purposes by people living on the southbank of the River Thames.\n\nCricket has been played at Kennington since the late 17th century although there are no definite records. In 1725 players were known to use the Horns tavern as their clubhouse. This was recorded a year after the first known cricket match had taken place. Other sports to have been periodically played on the common included quoits and bowls.\n\nPeople would gather at the common to listen to public speakers. In 1739, the Methodists John Wesley and George Whitefield preached to an audience of 30,000.\n\nOn 10 April 1848, Irish Chartist leader, Feargus O'Connor addressed up to 50,000 people at Kennington over a petition in support of the Land Plan.\n\nThe \"Surrey gallows\" were located on the common. These were the south London equivalent of Tyburn when the entire area was still part of the County of Surrey (prior to the formation of the London County Council in 1889).\nThe gallows stood on the site of St. Mark's Church not far from Oval tube station. Records show public executions were conducted frequently throughout the period that the common was also hosting cricket matches. In total 129 men and 12 women were executed at Kennington but there may well have been others. The first person was Sarah Elston who was burned at the stake for the killing her husband on 24 April 1678. The last person executed was a forger on 5 August 1799.\n\nIn 1746, the Jacobite officer Francis Towneley, along with other members of the Manchester Regiment, who had been captured during the failed Jacobite rising of 1745, were convicted of high treason and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered on the common on 30 July. However, by then executioners possessed some discretion as to how much the condemned should suffer before death. Towneley was killed before his body was eviscerated. His head was placed on a pike on Temple Bar.\n\nThe earliest recorded use of the common for cricket was the London v Dartford match on 18 June 1724. This has been classified a first-class match given that it featured the two leading clubs of the time.\n\nIn August 1726, a combined London and Surrey XI played the Kent XI of leading patron Edwin Stead for a purse of 25 guineas.\n\nIn 1729, the 7 August edition of the \"London Evening Post\" reported: \"On Tuesday was played a great cricket match on Kennington Common between the Londoners and the Dartford men for a considerable sum of money, wager and bets, and the latter beat the former very much\".\n\nThere was a very close contest on the common in August 1730 when London defeated Surrey by 1 run. The report said that it \"was thought to be one of the completest matches that ever was played\".\n\nThe London v Sevenoaks game on 12 July 1731 is the first known to have been played in an enclosed ground. The report said \"the ground will be roped round and all persons are desired to keep without side of the same\".\n\nThe Surrey v London game on 28 September 1731 was promoted as \"likely to be the best performance of this kind that has been seen for some time\". The ground was again enclosed: \"for the convenience of the gamesters, the ground is to be staked and roped out\". It seems therefore that enclosure quickly became common practice in 1731. In addition, the advertisement refers to \"the whole county of Surrey as London's opponents\". The Prince of Wales was expected to attend and this is his first recorded involvement in cricket.\n\nNewspaper reports of the time were more concerned with odds than results and players were hardly ever mentioned by name. There was an exception on 7 August 1735 when the \"General Evening Post\" announced a single wicket match on the common the following Monday involving seven players of the London Club. The game would be three against four with Mr Wakeland, Mr Dunn and Mr Pool against Mr Marshall, Mr Ellis and two others. Ellis is known to have been London's best bowler while Dunn was a noted batsman.\n\nIn June 1736, a report of a single wicket match names Mr Wakeland, the distiller, and Mr George Oldner playing together against two famous Richmond players who are \"esteemed the best two in England\" (one of them may have been William Sawyer). Unfortunately the esteemed pair were not named, though one of them suffered serious facial injuries in this game when the ball came off his bat and hit his nose. The report rails against \"human brutes who insisted he should play on despite his injuries\". This is a reflection of gambling's stranglehold on the sport at the time.\n\nWhen Surrey played Kent on 20 September 1736, three soldiers apprehended a deserter but the crowd turned on them, rescued the deserter and \"after a severe discipline let them go about their business\"! Meanwhile, Surrey won the match by 2 wickets and, unusually for the time, the team scores are known: Kent 41 & 53; Surrey 71 & 24-8.\n\nFrom this time on, the London club increasingly used the Artillery Ground for its home matches and that also became the main venue for the highly popular single wicket contests of the 1740s. The common became one of several home venues used by Surrey: for example, Moulsey Hurst, Laleham Burway and others. Very few major matches were played on the common thereafter. Executions did continue and it is possible that this association eventually drove the cricketing patrons away, especially given their subsequent withdrawal from the Artillery Ground because of its reputation for uncontrolled gambling.\n\nThere was one particularly violent execution on 30 July 1746 when nine men of the Manchester Regiment who had joined the Jacobite Rising were hanged, drawn and quartered. There are no reports of cricket on the common that year but a match did take place at the Artillery Ground on the same day.\n\nIn all, 22 first-class matches were played on the common until the last in May 1785 which was, curiously, not a Surrey game but Middlesex v Essex. Numerous minor matches were also recorded there.\n\nThe common continued to stage executions until the end of the 18th century while fairs, orators and other popular events continued into the 19th century.\n\nUnder a scheme sponsored by the royal family, the common was enclosed in the mid 19th century. Kennington Park was opened in 1854. It was created using the land between Kennington Park Road and St Agnes Place. However, with the growth of London throughout the next century, the remaining parts of the common have been consumed by urbanisation.\n\nCricket remains at Kennington. In 1845 the newly formed Surrey County Cricket Club established The Oval (formerly the Kennington Oval) on part of the old common that was used as a market garden.\n\n"}

The South African national team has also been investigated.\n\nIn the 18 months prior to February 2013, Europol investigated 680 matches in 30 countries. In November 2013, 11 men were charged in Estonia with fixing 17 matches.\n\nThe problem is often attributed to criminal gangs based in Asia, who generate \"hundreds of billions of euros per year.\"\n\nPlayers who have publicly rejected bribes have been praised.\n\nIn September 2018, the BBC reported on match fixing in Algerian football.\n\nOn 30 November 2017, Keshla FK confirmed that they had terminated the contracts of Nizami Hajiyev and Mirhüseyn Seyidov due to suspicion of match manipulating, with both also being arrested.

Despite its name, the CSL is not a national league as the teams are located solely in Southern Ontario. On September 12, 2012, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that a CSL game held in September 2009 was fixed. On January 31, 2013, the CSA announced it was decertifying the league. Following the 2013 announcement, the Canadian MLS teams Toronto FC and Montreal Impact both withdrew their academy teams from participation in the CSL.\n\nThe CSL continued to operate after decertification by the CSA. The International Centre for Sport Security (ICSS) later reported that 42% of matches in the \"rogue league's\" 2015 season showed signs of suspicious betting activity. In 2016, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police opened investigations in the alleged CSL match fixing.\n\nSix people, including three current players and ex-player Delroy Facey, were arrested in November 2013 on suspicion of match fixing. Two Singaporean men were later charged, while two non-league footballers for Whitehawk were also charged in December 2013. As a result of this investigation, three people were jailed in June 2014.\n\nLater that month, professional footballer Sam Sodje was investigated after he was filmed by an undercover journalist claiming to have fixed matches; a total of six people were arrested, including active player DJ Campbell. Campbell was later cleared of all allegations. Cristian Montaño was also named as one of those arrested, and he was later sacked by club Oldham Athletic. Montaño later denied the accusations. In March 2014 the six players were re-arrested, alongside seven new players, all based in North-West England. The seven new players arrested were later named as John Welsh, Keith Keane, Bailey Wright, David Buchanan, Ben Davies and Graham Cummins (who all play for Preston North End), and Stephen Dawson (who plays for Barnsley); all seven stated they were innocent. The men were late released from bail. In January 2015 all 13 players were released without charge.\n\nRepresentatives from a number of sports met in December 2013 to discuss the issue, while former player Alan Shearer stated there should be a \"zero tolerance\" approach to the problem. Darren Bailey of the FA also stated that the country's gambling laws did not help in tackling match fixing in the sport.\n\nIn June 2014, it was announced that 13 games were believed to have been fixed in British football during the 2013–14 season.\n\nOn 1 September 2014 former professional player Delroy Facey was charged over alleged match fixing. The trial began in April 2015, when he was accused of being a \"middleman\" for others who had already been convicted of the crime. After being found guilty later that month he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail.\n\nIn November 2014, the presidents of Ligue 2 clubs Caen and Nîmes were amongst several arrested on suspicion of match fixing. The arrests followed a 1–1 draw between Caen and Nîmes in May 2014, a result very beneficial for each club.\n\nCorruption has long been endemic in Greek football.\n\n\nIn June 2018, prosecutors began investigating Parma in relation to alleged match-fixing. In July 2018 Parma player Emanuele Calaiò received a two-year ban after being found guilty of match fixing for “eliciting reduced effort” through text messages to Spezia players in their final match of the 2017–18 Serie B to gain promotion; Parma received a 5-point deduction for the 2018–19 Serie A. On 9 August, Parma had the 5-point deduction expunged and Calaiò's ban reduced, expiring on 31 December 2018.\n\nOn 14 October 2015, the Kathmandu Police arrested five Nepalese national team players suspected of match fixing in the world cup qualifiers 2011. The arrest was based on information coming from AFC and their collaboration with Sportradar Security Services.\n\nOn November 2015, these five Nepalese players appeared in court charged with match-fixing.\n\nIn 2004, Polícia Judiciária (Portuguese Judiciary Police) launched the operation Apito Dourado and named several Portuguese club presidents and football personalities as suspects of match fixing, most notably FC Porto's chairman Pinto da Costa. Some of the wiretaps used as proof, which were deemed unusable in court, can be found on YouTube.\n\nIn January 2008, the president Ratko Butorović of Serbian first division side Vojvodina Novi Sad, stadium director Milan Čabrić and referees Mihajlo Jeknić, Borislav Kasanski and Goran Kovačević were amongst several arrested on suspicion of match fixing.\n\nRatko Butorović nicknamed \"Bata Kankan\" was arrested on suspicion of bribing referee Mihajlo Jeknic with 4,000 Euros to lead the match at Lučani on December 12 last year in favor of Butorović's Vojvodina Novi Sad that was a visitor.\n\nIn October 2009, Serbia beat Romania in a suspicious 5–0 in Belgrade in a FIFA World Cup 2010 qualifying match.

'People have known about match-fixing for a long time, but this is the first time that players talk about it in public. Unfortunately, there is a lot of crime and there are a lot of hooligans in Serbian football. Many of those who know something, have no courage to talk about fixed matches, because of their personal safety. Some of the players have received threatening text messages: if they do not keep quiet, they will suffer serious consequences.'\n\nIn July 2014 a total of 15 people were indefinitely suspended by the Sierra Leone Football Association over allegations of match-fixing - 4 players (Ibrahim Kargbo, Ibrahim Koroma, Samuel Barlay and Christian Caulker) as well as 3 referees and 8 officials, including Rodney Michael. Koroma later denied the allegations, and an inquiry into the allegations was also announced. The bans on the 15 players was lifted in March 2015.\n\nIn May 2018, 35 Ukrainian clubs were accused of match-fixing.\n"}

{"id": "3376653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3376653", "title": "Nine's Wide World of Sports", "text": "Nine's Wide World of Sports\n\nNine's Wide World of Sports is a long running sports anthology brand on Australian television, aired on the Nine Network. All major sports, events and series covered by the network are broadcast under this brand, the flagship sports being rugby league (National Rugby League) and Australian Open Tennis. Previous sporting rights include the Australian Football League, Australian Cricket Team home season, spring and autumn horse racing, swimming until 2008, and golf (U.S. Masters) since 2018.\n\nWide World of Sports (WWoS) is a long-used title for Nine's sport programming. All sports broadcasts on Nine air under the WWoS brand. It was also the name of a popular sports magazine program that aired most Saturdays and Sundays. This program filled many of the summer daytime hours. The program premiered at 1:00 pm on Saturday, 23 May 1981, and was initially hosted by Mike Gibson and Ian Chappell, before being hosted in the 1990s by Max Walker and Ken Sutcliffe. Ian Maurice was the regular anchor at the WWOS Update Desk. The show ended in 1999, due in large part to the rise of Fox Sports (which Nine's owner owned half of) and other subscription sport channels., but the show returned in 2008 on Sunday mornings.\n\nFrom the early 1970s, the main sport aired nationally under the WWoS brand was cricket. Nine's majority owner Kerry Packer created World Series Cricket in part because he couldn't obtain the rights to Australian test matches at home, even though he offered the Australian Cricket Board a $1.5 million 3-year contract which was rejected by the ACB who signed a 3-year deal with the ABC to broadcast test matches. This led to Packer signing in secret some of the world's best cricket players for a breakaway competition. The ABC and Nine then signed a truce after a long dispute in 1972, with Nine securing the exclusive rights to telecast Australian cricket.\n\nFrom that point until 2006, Nine based its summer schedule around broadcasts of cricket internationally and domestic. Its cricket broadcasts in that era revolutionised the way the sport was covered, featuring cameras placed at both ends of the field (after Packer famously complained about seeing \"cricketer's bums\" every second over), instant replays, and other innovations. World Series Cricket made many other changes to cricket, having a huge impact on the game.\n\nIn 1984, Billy Birmingham (\"The Twelfth Man\") released a best-selling comedy album making fun of the cricket portion of the show. He went on to release a series of albums ridiculing all aspects of Wide World of Sports, calling the show \"Wired World of Sports\". From the first to the most recent (2006), all have reached number one on the Australian album chart.\n\nJanuary 1995 saw the beginning of Premier Sports Network, the channel that was to become Fox Sports. It secured the rights to Australia's cricket tour of the West Indies, Nine's first challenge since winning its World Series war. Nine tried to stop the broadcast under Australia's \"anti-siphoning\" rules, which exist to stop certain popular sporting events being screened exclusively on pay television. But it failed when Premier Sports Network came to an agreement to broadcast the tour free to air on Network 10. \n\nWWoS's other main sport was and is rugby league. This was challenged in 1997 by the establishment of Super League, the repercussions of which led to Nine's parent company owning half of Fox Sports that year, and ultimately Nine's move away from popular live sport.\n\nThis partial purchase of Fox Sports roughly coincided with the end of Nine's traditional Saturday and Sunday daytime schedule of sports programming. What had once filled it now filled subscription channels, mainly Fox Sports. Old movies and other low rating programs filled much of the space.\n\nBetween the late 1970s and 1997, when Australians had wanted to watch continuous sport at home on a summer weekend, they had largely done so by tuning to Nine. Those in NSW, Queensland and the ACT did this all year round, due to rugby league's popularity in those areas. Now Fox Sports had that mantle, and gave viewers continuous sport all week long.\n\nOn 25 January 2001, The Nine Network acquired broadcast rights for Friday night and Sunday games in the Australian Football League, the elite Australian rules football competition in 2001. They shared the rights with Network Ten and Foxtel from 2002 through to 2006, but the deal assigned the rights for finals matches to Network Ten, a deal which reportedly flabbergasted Nine boss Kerry Packer.\n\nAs it also had the rights for all major swimming competitions until 2008, with major swimming competitions shown in primetime. During the early to mid-2000s, Nine for the first time had the FTA rights to the highest competitions of Australia's four biggest spectator sports: rugby league, Australian rules (shared with Ten), cricket and swimming.\nWhile Nine no longer had the volume of sport it once had, during the 2000-2006 period it dominated non-Olympic sport broadcasting in Australia.\n\nIn January 2006, the Seven Network and Network Ten exercised their \"first and last\" rights agreement with the AFL to trump the Nine Network's $780 million bid for broadcasting rights for the years 2007 to 2011. If Seven and Ten were unable to match the AFL's \"quality of coverage\" demands by 5 May 2006 (better coverage into regional areas, northern states and on pay television, as promised in the Nine bid) the AFL would have been allowed to award the broadcasting rights back to Nine. The Seven/Ten consortium, however, obtained the rights, with Nine broadcasting its last AFL match on a Sunday hosted by Tony Jones with a guest appearance from Nine's then chief executive and former AFL commentator Eddie McGuire.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2006-2007 cricket season, Nine no longer broadcast Australian domestic cricket but replaced the coverage with delayed National Basketball League matches. The domestic cricket matches, long a mainstay of Nine's summer programming, moved exclusively to Fox Sports.\n\nIt was thought that the Seven Network would continue its tradition of airing the Olympic Games for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. However, Nine in joint partnership with Foxtel, has secured broadcasting rights which the network has described as the most comprehensive coverage of the Olympics. The partnership also won the rights to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\nFor more than 40 years, the Nine Network had also broadcast the prestigious Wimbledon tennis tournament before ultimately dropping it after the 2010 tournament, citing declining ratings. The last Wimbledon match televised by Nine was the men's singles final played between Rafael Nadal and Tomáš Berdych, which Nadal won. The Seven Network have since picked up the broadcasting rights to Wimbledon, from 2011 onwards.\n\nAfter a ten-year hiatus, it was announced that the \"Wide World of Sports\" program would return to Nine on 16 March 2008. This show is hosted by the previous host Ken Sutcliffe, with footy show star James Brayshaw as well as former Australian cricketer Adam Gilchrist.\n\nIn 2009, revolving co-hosts included former swimmers Giaan Rooney, Nicole Livingstone and former cricketer Michael Slater. The show originally aired for 90 minutes but was recently extended to two hours. It airs on Sunday mornings at 9am till 11am.\n\nWide World of Sports returned for another year in 2009. Michael Slater and Grant Hackett joined the team as co-hosts alongside Ken Sutcliffe and Giaan Rooney. Nicole Livingstone did not return to the program in 2009, as she joined Network Ten as a commentator. Giaan Rooney resigned from the Nine Network at the end of 2012 to join the Seven Network.\n\nThe show was nominated for the \"Most Popular Sports Program\" award at the 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015 Logie Awards, being beaten by \"The NRL Footy Show\" on all occasions.\n\nThe show is no longer airing as of 2017. Sports Sunday replaced the show in the Sunday 10am timeslot.\n\n\"Nine's Wide World of Sports\" holds broadcast rights to the following events:\n\n The Nine Network televised the 2011 US Open final between Serena Williams and Samantha Stosur in its entirety.\n\n\"Nine's Wide World of Sports\" has presented the following recurring programs:\n\"Nine's Wide World of Sports\" has hosts and commentators for a variety of sporting events. The following is a list of past and present personalities featured:\n\n\n\nVarious Nine programs including \"Today\", \"Mornings\", \"Millionaire Hot Seat\", \"The Footy Show\", \"60 Minutes\" and \"Australia's Funniest Home Videos\" went on hiatus during Nine's broadcast of the 2012 London Olympics. A daily two-hour highlights package \"London Gold\" aired at 9am weekdays following the live overnight coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its primary competitor is PepsiCo's Gatorade brands.\n\nIn 1988, Powerade became the official sports drink of the Olympics, alongside Aquarius, another sports drink made by Coca-Cola. It is a rival of another sports drink, Gatorade.\nIn July 2001, The Coca-Cola Company launched a new formula for Powerade including vitamins B, B and B, which play a role in energy metabolism.\n\nIn July 2002, The Coca-Cola Company updated the bottles of the standard Powerade (previous logo styling) to a new sport-grip bottle.\n\nIn 2002, The Coca-Cola Company introduced Powerade Option to the United States, in response to Gatorade's popular Propel. Option is a \"low Calorie sports drink\" that is colorless and sweetened with high fructose corn syrup, sucralose, and acesulfame potassium, to provide sugar-conscious consumers with another rehydration choice. Powerade Option took 36% of the Fitness Water category behind Propel's 42%.\n\nIn 2007, Powerade Zero was released, a sports drink with electrolytes, which contains no sugar, no calories and no carbohydrates. Powerade Option was subsequently discontinued.\n\nIn June 2009, The Coca-Cola Company bought Glacéau, owner of brands such as VitaminWater and SmartWater, for $4.1 billion, a price tag that signaled the company’s seriousness in pursuing growth of non-carbonated beverages. Since then, the company has also given its Glacéau management team control of its Powerade sports drink brand.\n\nPowerade's main competition is Gatorade marketed by the Quaker Oats Company, a division of PepsiCo. Gatorade, which was branded at the University of Florida in 1965, was the first commercially available sports drink in the United States. It now holds a commanding share of the market. As of 2011, Gatorade held a 70 percent market share to Powerade's 28.5 percent.\n\nAll Sport is a competitor marketed by All Sport, Inc. and distributed by the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group. All Sport was marketed by PepsiCo until 2001, when Gatorade's maker, the Quaker Oats Company was acquired by PepsiCo. All Sport was sold to the Monarch Beverage Company soon after. Powerade and All Sport have each been distributed through their own direct store deliver channels. It was subsequently purchased by Gary Smith, the Chairman & CEO of All Sport, Inc. based in Austin, Texas.\n\nOutside the United States the Lucozade energy drink (manufactured since 1927 by the pharmaceutical company now known as GlaxoSmithKline) competes with Powerade. Lucozade's formulation differs in that it uses primarily glucose and contains caffeine. The more direct competitor to Powerade and Gatorade is Lucozade Sport.\n\n\n\n\"Note: Standard 8 ounce servings meet the FDA definition of 'low sodium' and have less sodium than a glass of chocolate milk. \"\n\nCurrently, there are sixteen flavors of Powerade available in the United States:\nIn addition, there are five flavors of Powerade Zero, a zero calorie version of Powerade:\n\nDiscontinued flavors previously available in the United States:\n\n\n\nDiscontinued Flavours\n\n\nDiscontinued Flavors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike its main competitor, Gatorade, Powerade is made with sugar, syrups and salt.\nOne Powerade ad campaign saying that Powerade ION4 is superior to Gatorade has been accused of being deceptive and false by Pepsi, the parent owner of Gatorade. The courts ruled in favor of Powerade as of August 2009.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3496672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3496672", "title": "The Jackie Robinson Story", "text": "The Jackie Robinson Story\n\nThe Jackie Robinson Story is a 1950 biographical film directed by Alfred E. Green (who had directed \"The Jolson Story\", \"one of the biggest hits of the 40s\") and starring Jackie Robinson as himself. The film focuses on Robinson's struggle with the abuse of bigots as he becomes the first African-American Major League Baseball player of the modern era.\n\nThe film is among the list of films in the public domain in the United States. However a new copyrighted \"restored and in color\" version was released in conjunction with the Jackie Robinson Foundation in 2008.\n\nThe film begins with Robinson as a boy. He is given a worn-out baseball glove by a stranger impressed by his fielding skills. As a young man, he becomes a multi-sport star at UCLA, but as he nears graduation, he worries about his future. His older brother Mack was also an outstanding college athlete and graduate, but the only job he could get was that of a lowly street cleaner.\n\nWhen America enters World War II, Robinson is drafted, serving as an athletic director. Afterward, he plays baseball with a professional African-American team. However, the constant travel keeps him away from his college sweetheart, Rae.\n\nThen one day, Brooklyn Dodgers scout Clyde Sukeforth invites him to meet Branch Rickey, president of the Major League Baseball team. At first, Robinson considers the offer to be a practical joke, as African Americans are not allowed to play in the segregated major leagues. When he is convinced that the opportunity is genuine, he and Rickey size each other up. After thinking over Rickey's warning about the hatred and abuse he would have to endure \"without\" being able to strike back, Robinson signs with the Dodgers' International League farm team, the Montreal Royals. Though he wants to delay marrying Rae to shield her, she insists on an immediate wedding so she can support her man in the trying times ahead.\n\nRobinson leads the league in hitting in his first year, and despite the grave concerns expressed by the Commissioner of Major League Baseball, Rickey goes ahead and promotes him to the Dodgers. Reviled at first by many of the fans and some of his own teammates, Robinson gets off to a shaky start, playing out of position at first base and going through a hitting slump, but then gradually wins people over with his talent and determination. The team goes on to win the pennant, with Robinson driving in the tying run and scoring the winning one in the deciding game.\n\nAt the end, Robinson is invited to address the United States House of Representatives in Washington, D.C.\n\nPrincipal photography for the film took place in the off-season following his third season with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Much of the film was shot at Gilmore Field, home of the PCL Hollywood Stars.\n\nEven during its initial release—in the era of racial segregation—the film received critical praise and fared well at the box office.\n\nAccording to Bosley Crowther, \"What is surprising...in this new film ...is the sincerity of the dramatization and the integrity of Mr. Robinson playing himself. Too often, in films of this nature about sports figures, fanciful or real, the sentiments are inflated and the heroics glorified. Here the simple story of Mr. Robinson's trail-blazing career is re-enacted with manifest fidelity and conspicuous dramatic restraint. And Mr. Robinson, doing that rare thing of playing himself in the picture's leading role, displays a calm assurance and composure that might be envied by many a Hollywood star.\"\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nOn April 19, 2005, 20th Century Fox and Legend Films released a colorized version of the film, donating a portion of the proceeds to the Jackie Robinson Foundation, a charity that benefits education for gifted students. An \"official\" version remains in release by MGM Home Entertainment (whose sister company, United Artists, produced this film).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18704592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18704592", "title": "West Park Oval", "text": "West Park Oval\n\nWest Park Oval is an Australian Rules football, cycling and athletics venue located on the shores of Bass Strait in Burnie, Tasmania.\nIt is the current home of the Burnie Dockers in the Tasmanian State League and previously in the NTFL and in the original TFL Statewide League.\n\nWest Park Oval was also home of the former Cooee Football Club (later renamed Burnie Hawks in 1987 and the former Burnie Tigers Football Club in the North West Football Union (NWFU) and later of the NTFL until both clubs amalgamated in early 1994.\n\nThe ground hosted five Tasmanian State Grand Finals between 1961 and 1978, including the final State Premiership decider held in 1978, and was also the site of some of Tasmanian football's most infamous matches.\n\nDuring an NWFU match in 1936 a hurricane hit West Park in the final quarter of a match between Burnie Tigers and Penguin, and as players were unable to keep their feet in the blinding rain and wind, many lay flat in the mud as there was great panic in the crowd as the hurricane threatened to demolish the Main Stand. Burnie (finishing the match with eleven men on the field) won 8.10 (58) to Penguin (who finished with six men on the field) 2.5 (17).\n\nArguably, Tasmanian football's most controversial match was the 1967 Tasmanian State Premiership Final between Wynyard and North Hobart, where hundreds of Wynyard fans invaded the field and tore down the goalposts as North Hobart's Dickie Collins went back to take a kick after the siren with Wynyard leading by one point. Umpires, players, team officials and police attempted to clear a path for Collins to take his kick, but Collins was eventually escorted from the ground under police protection, taking the match ball with him as a souvenir. The Tasmanian Football League declared the match a \"no result\" and withheld the 1967 State Premiership.\n\nIn 1967, a ground record crowd for a football match of 12,951 attended an exhibition match between the North Western Football Union representative team and the defending Victorian Football League premiers, . St Kilda 35.27 (237) defeated NWFU 13.7 (85).\n\nIn 1996, visiting side Hobart became the first side in the TFL in 38 years not to register a goal in a senior match, managing a paltry 0.5 (5) against the Burnie Dockers and losing by 97 points in atrocious conditions.\n\nThe lowest attendance ever recorded at a TFL final was recorded at West Park in atrocious weather conditions in 1997 where only 1,010 braved the elements to see the Burnie Dockers defeat Clarence 14.4 (88) to 2.8 (20) in the Qualifying Final (the two sides would meet again three weeks later in the Grand Final at North Hobart Oval and fight out a 38-goal thriller, with Clarence turning the tables on the hapless Dockers). \nIt hosted AFL pre-season practice matches in the early 1990s, with over 12,000 attending the Carlton v St Kilda match in 1991. \nWest Park was the first Tasmanian football venue to install lights for night football, the first night match was played between Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) in a Foster's NFL Shield match on 9 June 1989 where the visiting team won by 14 points in wet and cold conditions. \nIt became the first ground to host a night match in TFL history on 15 May 1993 when Burnie Hawks defeated coastal-rival Devonport by 51 points.\nWest Park is also the home of the Burnie Athletics Club and the City of Burnie Cycling Club; the ground hosts the Burnie Gift and Burnie Wheel each year.\n\nIn 1977 cyclist Danny Clark staged one of the most memorable moments in Tasmanian sporting history when he surged from the rear of the pack, 100m behind on the final lap to scream home to take out the 1977 Burnie Wheel before almost 15,000 screaming fans on 1 January 1977. The legendary call of the finish of the race by North West Coastal sporting identity Harold 'Tiger' Dowling is etched in Coastal sporting folklore.\nWest Park has three grandstands, the 1914-built Burnie Athletic Club Memorial Stand on the Bass Strait side of the ground, an open stand on the opposite wing opened during the 1960s and the newly built The Point members pavilion opened in 2009.\n\nA State cricket match between Tasmania and New South Wales was held at the venue on 4 December 2010. \nAfter losing the toss Tasmania were put in and scored 189 in the hybrid one-day format. New South Wales won by 7 wickets. The crowd was 4,552, the highest crowd at the venue since the former TFL Statewide League. The match was played under foggy but clearing skies to a fine 26 degrees. Glenn McGrath was a special guest at the match. Since the small boundary towards the Southern End is approximately 70 metres, Phil Hughes hit a ball onto the Bass Highway to the delight of the crowd. The ground is scheduled to hold another List A match in November 2011 between Tasmania and South Australia in the 2011–12 Ryobi One-Day Cup.\n\n"}
