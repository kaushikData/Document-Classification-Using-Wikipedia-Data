It is the most prestigious award for individual players in the AFLW. It is also widely acknowledged as the highest individual honour in the sport of women's Australian rules football.\n\nTo determine the \"best\" player, the three field umpires (not the goal umpires or boundary umpires) confer after each home-and-away match and award three votes, two votes and one vote to the players they regard as the best, second-best and third-best in the match, respectively. On the awards night, the votes from each match are tallied, and the player or players with the highest number of votes is awarded the trophy (subject to eligibility – see below).\n\nThe current voting system, which is the same as that of the Australian Football League (AFL)'s Brownlow Medal, has been used since the award's inception. If two or more eligible players score the equal highest number of votes, each wins a trophy.\n\nThe \"fairest\" component of the trophy is achieved by making ineligible any player who is suspended by the AFL Tribunal during the home-and-away season.

Its Registered address is Osbourne House, 143-145 Stanwell Road, Ashford, Middlesex TW15 3QN. The company provides tickets and arranges touring parties for some of its members to follow the English cricket team in the UK and overseas. The name is also applied to followers of the team who join in with match day activities in the crowd, but do not necessarily travel as part of an organised tour. The term \"barmy\" is English slang for \"mad\".\n\nThe group, then less organised, was given its name by the Australian media during the 1994-1995 Test series in Australia, reportedly for the fans' hopeless audacity in travelling all the way to Australia in the near-certain knowledge that their team would lose, and the fact that they kept on chanting encouragement to the England team even when England were losing quite badly. It was co-founded by Paul Burnham.\n\nThe Barmy Army, which is now a limited company, states that it wants to \"make watching cricket more fun and much more popular\". The group uses flags, banners, songs and chants to encourage the team and crowd participation in their activities. In contrast to the reputations of some sports fans for hooliganism, the Barmy Army organisers actively discourage and avoid such behaviour.\n\nThe group engages in charity work and has gained a good reputation among most cricket administrators. However, many cricket followers find their constant chanting to be annoying and disruptive, particularly during the afternoon sessions of Test matches when the chanting of the Barmy Army, fuelled by their consumption of large amounts of alcohol, often becomes a repetitive, irritating background noise; among others, the renowned cricket writer/commentator Christopher Martin-Jenkins accused them of \"demeaning English cricket\".\n\n\"Barmy Army\" was a football chant sung by fans at many grounds, originally sung at Hillsborough by Sheffield Wednesday in the early 1980s. This was because Howard Wilkinson, known as Sergeant Wilko, who was manager at the time inspired the chant, \"Sergeant Wilko's Barmy Army\". In conjunction with the increasing appearance of English football shirts at cricket grounds in the early 1990s, the song's droning, repetitive cry of \"Barmy Army, Barmy Army, Barmy Army\" transferred to domestic Test cricket arenas at Old Trafford and Headingley. It was particularly apparent during the 1993 Ashes tour.\nThroughout the 1990s, increased spending power, via a stronger British Pound at the time, enabled fans to take the song overseas when following tours of the English national cricket team. Because of that particular song, and the fact that it seemed to represent English fans' activity of standing in the hot sun, drinking lager all day, until they were sunburnt and unwell, it became a description as well as a song. David Lloyd and Ian Botham used the tag to describe the supporters whilst commentating for Sky Sports during England's tours from 1993 to 1995.\n\nOnly in the mid-1990s was the tag recognised as an official title for English touring cricket fans and adopted by what is now recognised as the official Barmy Army.\n\nIn the late 1990s performers Richard Stilgoe and Peter Skellern recognised the need for an anthem for the loyal supporters of a team that regularly seemed to lose and wrote a stirring song called \"The Barmy Army\" which they included in their touring repertoire. It can be found on their 1999 CD \"A Quiet Night Out\" and humorously celebrates the English team's skill at \"snatching defeat from the jaws of victory\".\nMost grounds now set aside areas especially for Barmy Army fans apart from Lord's.\n\nSupporters of English national teams in other sports are also subsidiaries of Barmy Army. The rugby equivalent was formed in 2014, they also form part of the Army to support British and Irish Lions, while there is another separate subsidiary for Rugby League.\n\n"}

The Michigan State Spartans college baseball team also plays select home games at Cooley Law School Stadium. The stadium is situated in downtown Lansing in the Stadium District on a relatively narrow strip of land between and below Larch and Cedar streets.\n\nIt is primarily used for baseball, though it has also hosted an ice skating rink, an outdoor movie theater, a haunted house, and served as a concert venue for the annual Common Ground Music Festival. Due to the dimensions of the city block in which the stadium was constructed, the right and left field fences 'notch' sharply into distances of at each foul pole.\n\nThe stadium replaced a block of storefronts along Michigan Avenue. Originally budgeted $10 million for construction, the construction costs rose slightly to $12.8 million.\n\nGroundbreaking for the stadium took place on April 3, 1995, and it was officially opened exactly one year later on April 3, 1996. Its first game was between the college baseball teams of the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. Two days later, the Lansing Lugnuts had their first game at the venue against the Rockford Cubbies.\n\nOn February 22, 2010, Lansing mayor Virgil Bernero announced that the stadium would be renamed Thomas M. Cooley Law School Stadium, a result of the park's new sponsorship agreement. In March 2010, Lansing-based Jackson National Life Insurance Company purchased the rights to name the field \"Jackson Field\" for 1 year. Thus, the full name of the venue is Jackson Field at Thomas M. Cooley Law School Stadium.\n\nOn March 12, 2014, a $22 million renovation proposal for the stadium was announced named The Outfield. It would include $11 million in public bonds for renovation of the actual stadium structure including new turf, and updated locker rooms, concessions and new box seats. $11 million in additional private investments which would include 80 apartments, a year-round bar and grill, and a new scoreboard. The proposal also includes the city negotiating a new contract with the team which is proposed to bring in an additional 25% revenue for the city.\nOn October 19, 2018, the Michigan State Spartans and Michigan Wolverines had their rivalry match, the Battle for the Mitten, at Cooley Law School Stadium.

Such variations are often quieter than other lines because the early release of tension minimizes the possibility of surprise tactics or sharp, forcing lines, particularly where it results in a symmetrical pawn structure. \nWhite may choose an exchange variation as a relatively risk-free way to try to exploit White's first-move advantage. Players such as Mikhail Botvinnik and Yasser Seirawan used the Exchange Variation of the Slav Defense this way.\n\nWhite may also play an exchange variation in an effort to draw the game. This approach is not without risks. International Master John L. Watson has written that in the Exchange Variation of the French Defense, \"Black can always make the struggle an unbalanced one if he chooses\". Moreover, playing so blatantly for a draw may place a psychological burden on White: \"White has already ceded the advantage of the first move, and he knows it, whereas Black is challenged to find ways to seize the initiative.\"\n\nNot all exchange variations are quiet; the Exchange Variation of the Grunfeld Defense is regarded as one of White's sharpest and most aggressive options, since it allows White to build up a massive pawn center, which Black will try to undermine. The Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined often involves attacks by one or both sides on the enemy king.\n\nExchange variations involving the exchange of pawns often lead to symmetrical central pawn structures, as in the Slav Defense and the French Defense, among others. The resulting pawn structures may also be asymmetrical, as in the Caro-Kann Defense and Queen's Gambit Declined. In the Ruy Lopez, Exchange Variation pieces (White's bishop and Black's knight) rather than pawns are traded. In the Exchange Variation of the Grunfeld Defense, both a pair of pawns and a pair of knights are traded.\n\nThe diagram at right shows a position in the Exchange Variation of the French Defense, after the moves:\n\nThe position is completely symmetrical and White's advantage is limited to his right to move. The Exchange French is usually regarded as a passive alternative selected by a White player eager for a draw, but Paul Morphy and more recently Garry Kasparov have used it as a winning try.\n\n"}

It is the most common form of sailboat racing and contrasts with match racing and team racing.\n\nFleet racing can take place in two main formats. In the \"One-Design\" basis, all boats in the fleet are of the same class (i.e., the same design, length, and sail area). Alternatively, different classes of boats can race on a handicap basis, where faster classes give time to slower classes either by starting the race later or having their finishing times adjusted after the race's completion. Racing can occur around or between buoys or geographical features such as islands, and take place over short inshore courses or long distances offshore (such as the Volvo Ocean Race). \n\nThe rules for fleet racing are set by World Sailing and can be supplemented by race-specific rules set by the organisers of a particular race. Contraventions of the rules are resolved either by a boat voluntarily taking a penalty during the race, or by protest lodged and heard after the race. The rules of match racing, on the other hand, are normally enforced by umpires issuing penalties during a race.\n\nFleet racing involves fewer strategic and tactical considerations for the sailor than match racing. In fleet racing, the most important factor in the outcome of a race is usually the speed of each boat. Three-time Olympic sailing gold medallist Ben Ainslie, who made a foray into match racing for the 2007 America's Cup, has described the differences between fleet racing and match racing as \"huge\".\n\nIn the 2008 Olympics, all eleven sailing events were One-Design fleet races. On the other hand, the America's Cup is sailed as a series of match races.\n"}

Typically these titles are honorary in nature, meaning that they do not confer rank, but rather distinguish the individual as very highly revered in their school, system, or style.\n\nAsian martial arts traditionally use terms that are usually translated as \"teacher\" and the use of \"\" was a Western invention derived from 1950s United States war veterans returning home \nwith stories of the incredible martial feats of certain individuals and groups. Subsequently, they found their way into martial arts culture as marketing tactics to the extent that the titles are aligned to the 'elderly martial arts master' stock character. In Asian countries, such titles are more commonly reserved for religious leaders and saints.\n\nThe use of \"master,\" \"grandmaster,\" etc. is decided within an individual art or organization. The use may be self assigned; for example having promoted a student to 'teacher' level, or may be assigned by a governing body in arts with a more formalised structure, and some do not use it at all, for historic reasons or to avoid the 'elderly master' stereotype. The modern use of \"Dan\" rankings and Black belt and Red belt in martial arts both derive from Judo where they were adopted by its founder Kanō Jigorō.\n\nThere are many terms similar or equivalent to 'grandmaster' used by various martial arts traditions. Some of these terms derive from older systems, while others are relatively modern.\n\nJapanese martial arts commonly use Sensei (先生) meaning \"teacher\" or literally translated, \"born first\" or \"one who has gone before\". A \"Sensei\" is a person who has knowledge and is willing to teach that knowledge to another. A \"Sensei\" assists students in \"ken shiki\" \"the pursuit of knowledge\". Some organizations, such as the Bujinkan, Kodokan (Judo), and Shodokan Aikido, use the term shihan for high-ranking or highly distinguished instructors.\n, meaning \"the head family [house],\" is sometimes used to refer to \"founder of a style\" because many modern sōke are the first generation headmasters of their art, but most correctly refers to the current head. A sōke is considered the ultimate authority within their art and has the authority to issue a \"menkyo kaiden\" certificate indicating that someone has mastered all aspects of the style.\n\nThe actual Korean word for a student's master is sonsaeng. This term is only used by the student when speaking to the instructor. The student is \"hakseang\". (학생 HakSaeng 學生) Many Korean titles are often mistakenly translated as \"grandmaster\" (태사님 TaeSaNim 太師님). Sonseang-nim (선생님 SeonSaengNim 先生님) is a general term for a teacher of any subject as well as a respectful form of the word \"you\". Martial arts instructors (in Korea 4th Dan and above) are called \"Sabom-nim\" (사범님 SaBeomNim 師範님).\n\nVarious dialects of the Chinese language use different terms.\n\n\"Sifu\" is a common romanization, although the term and pronunciation are also used in other southern languages. In Mandarin Chinese, it is spelled \"shifu\" in pinyin. Using non-rhotic British English pronunciation, in Mandarin it would sound something similar to \"sure foo\". Using IPA, 'shi' is pronounced 'ʂɨ'. The 'i' is a short vowel. Many martial arts studios incorrectly pronounce this like \"she foo\". In Cantonese, it is said as \"see foo\" (almost like \"sea food\", without the \"d\" on the end).\n(師傅 or 師父; Pinyin: \"shīfu\", Standard pinyin: \"si1 fu6\") a modern term for \"teacher\".\n\nThe term \"Shifu\" is a combination of the characters \"teacher\" and \"father\" (師父) or a combination of the characters \"teacher\" and \"mentor\" (師傅). The traditional Chinese martial arts school, or \"kwoon\" (館, guǎn) is an extended family headed by the Shifu. The Shifu's teacher is the \"師公 honorable master\" or \"Shigong\". Similarly the Shifu's wife is the \"Shimu\" \"teacher mother\" and the grandmaster's wife is known as: 師姥 shi lao; or 師婆 shi po. Male and female students who began training before you and are thus senior, are 師兄\"Shixiong\" \"teacher older brothers\" and 師姐 \"Shijie\" \"teacher's sisters\". Women in traditional society did not have the same status as males (despite what modern movies depict). Students junior to you are your \"Shidi\" and \"Shimei\". The pattern extends to uncles, aunts, cousins, great uncles, and so forth (see above for a complete list of relational terms).\n\nSuch titles may be, to some extent, aligned to the \"elderly martial arts master\" stock character in fiction. In Oriental martial arts, traditional titular systems vary between nations and arts, but terms such as \"teacher\" were more common than \"master.\" The modern use came from Eastern to Western society in the 1950s with stories of martial feats seen in Asia.\n"}

Hiking apparel is usually selected to suit predicted weather conditions, taking into account UPF rating (Ultraviolet Protection Factor), weight, water and wind resistance. Today's hiking apparel is more advanced than previous years, having material that can be wind resistant, water-repellent and yet breathable, and lightweight. Some hiking apparel is designed to be \"breathable\", drawing moisture away from the body while protecting from the weather. \n\nUsually three layers of apparel are worn on a rough-weather hike, the first being mostly of synthetic material drawing moisture from the body, the second being of material with high thermal insulation capacity, and the third being of wind- and water-resistant material.\n\nToday's hiking boots have been designed to give maximum ankle support, and to be durable but light in weight. Many have a long-lasting hardened rubber sole. \n"}

It also refers to the defensive unit of players that are positioned in the region: first baseman, second baseman, shortstop, third baseman. Sometimes it includes the catcher and pitcher who (as a tandem) are often referred to separately as the battery.\n\nIn baseball the physical infield is where most of the action in a baseball game occurs, as it includes that area where the all-important duel between the pitcher and batter takes place. The pitcher stands on the pitcher's mound (a raised mound of dirt located at the center of the infield) and from there he pitches the ball to his catcher, who is crouched behind home plate sixty feet, six inches away at what might be called the cutlet of the diamond-shaped baseball field. To the left and right of the catcher are chalk boxes in the dirt called batter's boxes. The opposing team's batter must stand in one of the two boxes and from there he will attempt to hit the pitched ball with his bat. The umpire, who officiates the game, stands behind the catcher. The other important parts of the infield are the three bases, first base (to the pitcher's left, looking toward home plate), second base (behind the pitcher) and third base (to the pitcher's right). Together, home plate and the three bases form a diamond around the pitcher, with each side of the diamond measuring 90 feet.\n\nIn cricket infield is a central oval on the cricket field, the reference point for fielding restrictions in short forms of the game; in contrast to the more distant \"outfield\"\n\nInfield can refer to a region inside a closed horse racing or auto racing track, or to an area encircled by the track of a roller coaster.\n"}

It is in Reykjavík and seats 9,800 with a total capacity of 15,000.\n\nThe idea of building a sport venue in Laugardalur, along with some other entertainment facilities, dates back to 1871. At that time, the population of Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland, was only about 2,000. Laugardalur was also nearly 3 km (1.9 mi) away from residential areas. Little came out of this proposal the next 60 years or so.\n\nIn 1943, the town council set up the Laugardalsnefnd committee. Its task was to make proposals and ideas for the area. The committee then delivered the result later, which included building a new football stadium and a new swimming pool.\n\nConstruction of the field started in 1949 and lasted until 1952. A year later in 1953, construction of a new stand started. The stand had a capacity of 4,000 when completed.\n\nThe first match was played on Laugardalsvöllur in 1957 when the Iceland men's national football team played against Norway, two years before the official opening on 17 June 1959. A few years later, the stand was renovated and expanded, starting from 1965 to 1970.\n\nUnder the new stand there was opened a track-and-field facility, which operated until 2007, although there has always been all-weather running track around the pitch (upgraded in 1992). Later the year 1992, floodlights were inaugurated for the match against Greece.\n\nIn 1997, another new stand was built against the old stand, across the pitch. Constructions started a year earlier. It has a capacity of 3,500. At the same time, the old stand was relieved by matching it with the new stand by seating capacity.\n\nBig renovation and expansion of the old stand started in 2005. After the completion in 2007, the stadium has a capacity of 9,800. Additional capacity can be added by bringing in two temporary stands seating 1,500 each, giving the stadium a maximum capacity of 15,000 but after the new requirements of FIFA for national football stadiums, this addition method has been forbidden. No major renovations or expansions have occurred since 2007.\n\nThe largest attendance for a football match ever seen by Laugardalsvöllur was 20,204 in 2004 in a friendly match between Iceland and Italy. The largest attendance for the venue about 25,000 during a concert in 2007.\n\nOn 24 July 2018, American rock band Guns N' Roses played at the stadium in font of 25,000 people, at that time the largest rock concert ever held in Iceland. \n\nThe stadium comprises two big stands facing each other. West Stand is the main stand and the larger one. It is the only stand to hold all the facilities needed for the stadium, excluding stadium seating. For the purpose of football matches and other competitions, the stand has 4 changing rooms for players (mainly) and 2 others for referees, which also have the capability of accommodating facility for a doctor or drug test. There are two other rooms for football matches and athletics tournaments administration.\n\nThere have been plans to renovate and expand Laugardalsvöllur since Iceland men's national football team reached play-off for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in 2013. The team's success kept going until they went to UEFA Euro 2016 and reached quarter-finals. Both Icelandic football fans and KSÍ (the Football Association of Iceland) have been asking for new stadium because seats have sold out for nearly all official matches (even friendly matches) since 2013.\n\nSeveral ways are available, but all of them have at least two things in common: removing the running track and cover the stadium. KSÍ has stated that it wants a retractable-roof stadium for the possibility of multi-purpose stadium, that would increase the utilization of seating capacity in the long term.\n\nThere are stadiums in Europe that can be used as a guide for Iceland. They are all big and extremely expensive on the local scale. The upcoming construction of Laugardalsvöllur is, for instance, expected to cost about 8 billion ISK (about €62 million). If built, the new national football stadium of Iceland is likely to have a capacity of 20,000 or more.\n\nThe pitch itself would have to be dug many meters in the ground since the running track is to be removed and the bottom edge of the stadium will be moved closer to the pitch. By doing that, the stadium will have a lot more capacity. The new pitch is expected to be heated if natural grass is selected, due to hard winters in Iceland and also because of the new requirements of UEFA, which indicates that matches for some teams in the qualification competition, for the UEFA European Championship, shall also be played in the winter. The grass would then be maintained itself with an automatic irrigation sprinkler system.\n\nBecause the new stadium requires a retractable roof to cover the costs, it is possible that all present structures of Laugardalsvöllur will be demolished and a new, solid, oval-shaped stadium will be built; neither of the existing stands are specially designed to support additional roof that can roll back and forth on tracks, that can open and close the stadium altogether. \n\n"}

Schumacher entered Formula One with the Jordan racing team in 1991, qualifying seventh in his debut race at the Belgian Grand Prix. Following this race, he was signed by Benetton for the rest of the season. His first Grand Prix win came the following year at the same venue as his debut race. Schumacher won his first Formula One World Championship in 1994, a season in which he won eight races. His victory was controversial, as he was involved in a collision with fellow championship contender Damon Hill at the final race in Adelaide. Both drivers had to retire their cars which resulted in Schumacher securing the championship. He won his second championship the following year, winning nine races, and became the youngest double world champion at the time.\n\nSchumacher joined Ferrari in 1996. He finished third in the championship, winning three races, in a season dominated by the Williams team. His victory at the Spanish Grand Prix, which Schumacher won by 45 seconds, is noted as one of the great Formula One wet weather drives. In the 1997 season, Schumacher won five races but was disqualified from the championship after the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile concluded that he had deliberately collided with Jacques Villeneuve, his championship rival, at the European Grand Prix in Jerez. The following year, he won six races. Schumacher won his third world championship in 2000; the first for a Ferrari driver since 1979. He followed this with four consecutive championships from 2001 to 2004. During the 2001 season, at the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher won his 52nd Grand Prix, breaking Alain Prost's record for the most career Grand Prix wins. His 2002 season, in which he was on the podium in every race, included eleven race victories. The latter broke the record for the most wins in a single season. Schumacher surpassed this with thirteen race victories in 2004. His final Grand Prix win was at the 2006 Chinese Grand Prix; at the end of that season he retired from Formula One. Although he made a return to Formula One racing with Mercedes between 2010 and 2012, this did not result in any further victories.\n\nSchumacher contested 308 races in his career which included 91 Grand Prix wins; the majority of his race victories were for the Ferrari team with 72. His most successful circuit was Magny-Cours where he won eight times in his career. Schumacher's largest margin of victory was at the 1994 Brazilian Grand Prix, a race in which he lapped the field, and the smallest margin of victory was at the 2000 Canadian Grand Prix when he beat teammate Rubens Barrichello by 0.174 seconds.\n\nKey:\n\n"}

Rules are similar to tennis or ping-pong but is played in shorter matches of 3 games.\n\nThe game was invented in 1922, during the Taisho era (1912-1926), on the Hitachi Ltd. factory campus in Japan. Pan-Pon was started as a lunch exercise but has grown into a local sport in Ibaraki Prefecture. Tournaments within Hitachi plants, between plants, and among citizens in Ibaraki prefecture in Japan are organized. Outside Japan the sport is little known, but tournaments have been organized in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, United States, connected to the Hitachi Automotive plant there.\n\nPan-pon is played on a rectangular flat court, normally outdoors on asphalt alternatively indoors on plastic floor.\nThe court is 7 x 2.5 m with an inner serve area of 5.5 x 1 meter. The net is made of a 3-meter wooden plank, placed 40 cm above ground.\n\nPans from the kitchen are made of wood, 30 x 20 cm and ca 10 mm in thickness. A simple ledge can be mounted on one of the short sides to make it easier to hold.\n\nThe ball is an air-pumped rubber ball, size like a tennis ball (ca 70 mm diameter).

With over 8,464 acres of skiable terrain, 144 runs, snowcat skiing, side country skiing, backcountry tours and two terrain parks, Powder Mountain is the largest ski resort in the US by skiable acreage. Powder Mountain consistently tops \"Ski Magazine’s\" “Best Value Resort” category, taking home the honor five out of the past six years. With more than 300 inches of annual snowfall, Powder Mountain was ranked #2 for “Snow” and #4 for “Character” while also ranking 9th best by readers for Overall Satisfaction in 2012.\n\nPowder Mountain had its beginnings as the winter range for Frederick James Cobabe’s sheep herd. Between 1902 and 1948, Cobabe continually accumulated land around Eden, Utah. Old timers say that his property was severely overgrazed by previous owners and hardly a blade of grass could be found. The watershed was so poor that Wolf Creek dried up each fall. Fred’s soil conservation practices greatly improved the vegetation and Powder Mountain now is known as one of the best watersheds in the Wasatch Mountains.\n\nFred’s son, Dr. Alvin F. Cobabe, bought the livestock company with its 8,000 acres in 1948. While horseback riding with friends along Lightning Ridge in the 1950s, someone casually mentioned that the terrain would make a great ski resort. The idea rang true with Dr. Cobabe and he began to amass adjacent property adding to the thousands of acres acquired from his father. When the resort opened on February 19, 1972, he owned 14,000 acres.\n\nOnly the Sundown lift was open during Powder Mountain’s first season. The area was lit for night skiing and a ski school was established. Food was prepared on an outdoor barbecue. The Main Lodge, the Sundown Lodge and the Timberline lift were added to operations in the 1972–73 season.\n\nDr. Alvin Cobabe, at age 88, sold Powder Mountain, Inc in 2006 to Western American Holdings. The resort remained under the same management team, led by Aleta Cobabe, daughter of Alvin, during the 2006–07 season. \nWestern American sold Powder Mountain to events company Summit in 2013.\n\nPowder Mountain currently has six chair lifts (one triple, four fixed quad, and one detachable quad), and an additional three surface tows. Beyond lift accessed terrain, Powder Mountain also offers all-day Snowcat Powder Safaris, single ride cat skiing and inbound and backcountry guided tours through their Adventure Center. \n\nThe slopes on both sides of the road leading up to the resort—known as Powder Country—are served by a bus that will pick riders up at a waiting area halfway down the access road. There is also an $25 per-ride Snowcat service up Lightning Ridge (very close to James Peak). James Peak is one of the premier powder bowl runs in Utah.\n\nPowder Mountain’s terrain within the lift accessible area offers a wide variety of runs for riders of every skill level, including a large assortment of green, blue and black runs. With over 2,500 inbound vertical feet available and over 400 inches of annual snowfall, Powder Mountain is largely considered to be one of the premier powder skiing destinations in the world.\n\nPowder Mountain also offers ski-in, ski-out condos for rent at the summit, making it a convenient getaway for skiers of all levels. \n\n1971–72 season\n\n\n1972/73 Season\n\n1975/76 Season\n\n1981/82 Season\n\n1984/85 Season\n\n1986/87 Season\n\n\n1994/95 Season \n\n1999/2000 Season\n\n2006–07 season\n\n2012–13 season\n\n2016-17 season\n\n"}

Opened in October 1922, the stadium is recognized as a National Historic Landmark and a California Historic Civil Engineering landmark. At a modern capacity of an all-seated configuration at 90,888 (making it one of the rare stadiums in college football to have such a seating arrangement; many such stadiums have bench-style seating) the Rose Bowl is the 17th-largest stadium in the world, the 11th-largest stadium in the United States, and the 11th largest NCAA stadium.\n\nOne of the most famous venues in sporting history, the Rose Bowl is best known as a college football venue, specifically as the host of the annual Rose Bowl Game for which it is named. Since 1982, it has also served as the home stadium of the UCLA Bruins football team. The stadium has also hosted five Super Bowl games, second most of any venue. The Rose Bowl is also a noted soccer venue, having hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final, 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final, and the 1984 Olympic Gold Medal Match, as well as numerous CONCACAF and United States Soccer Federation matches.\n\nThe stadium and adjacent Brookside Golf and Country Club are owned by the city of Pasadena and managed by the Rose Bowl Operating Company, a non-profit organization whose board is selected by council members of the city of Pasadena. UCLA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses also have one member on the company board.\n\nThe game now known as the Rose Bowl Game was played at Tournament Park though January 1922, about southeast, adjacent to the campus of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association, the game's organizer, realized the temporary stands were inadequate for a crowd of more than 40,000, and sought to build a better, permanent stadium.\n\nThe stadium was designed by architect Myron Hunt in 1921. His design was influenced by the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut, which opened in 1914. The Arroyo Seco was selected as the location for the stadium. The Rose Bowl was under construction from Feb. 27, 1922 to October 1922. The nearby Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum also was under construction during this time and would be completed in May 1923, shortly after the Rose Bowl was completed. Originally built as a horseshoe, the stadium was expanded several times. The southern stands were completed in 1928, enclosing the stadium into a complete bowl.\n\nThe field's alignment is nearly north-south, offset slightly northwest, and the elevation at street level is approximately above sea level.\n\nThe stadium's name was alternatively \"Tournament of Roses Stadium\" or \"Tournament of Roses Bowl\", until being settled as \"Rose Bowl\" before the 1923 Rose Bowl game, in reference to the unusually named (at the time) Yale Bowl.\n\nThe stadium is extremely difficult to access due to the traffic caused by single-lane residential street access. It has no dedicated parking lot for visitors and parking issues have routinely caused visitors to spend two to three hours completing the last mile to the stadium on game days. In 2016, Rose Bowl contracted ParkJockey to streamline parking in and around the stadium.\n\nThere are also shuttles to help visitors get to the stadium and mobile lights powered by generators to provide visibility for people walking on the golf course at night.\n\nThe first game was a regular season contest in 1922, when California defeated USC on October 28. This was the only loss for USC and Cal finished the season undefeated. California declined the invitation to the 1923 Rose Bowl game and USC went instead. The stadium was dedicated officially on January 1, 1923, when USC defeated Penn State \n\nThe stadium seating has been reconfigured several times since its construction in 1922. The South end was filled in to complete the bowl and more seats have been added. The original wooden benches were replaced by aluminum benches in 1969. All new grandstand and loge seats had been installed since 1971. New red seat backs had been added on 22,000 seats prior to the 1980 Rose Bowl. A Rose Bowl improvement was conducted because of UCLA's 1982 move and the 1984 Summer Olympics. This resulted in new seat backs for 50,000 seats.\n\nFor many years, the Rose Bowl had the largest football stadium capacity in the United States, eventually being surpassed by Michigan Stadium (107,601). The Rose Bowl's maximum stated seating capacity was 104,091 from 1972 to 1997. Some of the seats closest to the field were never used during this time for UCLA regular season games, and were covered by tarps. Official capacity was lowered following the 1998 Rose Bowl. Slightly different figures are given for the current capacity, for the lower level seats behind the team benches are not used for some events since the spectators can not see through the standing players or others on the field. UCLA reports the capacity at 91,136. The Tournament of Roses reports the capacity at 92,542. The 2006 Rose Bowl game, which was also the BCS championship game, had a crowd of 93,986. In the 2011 contest between TCU and Wisconsin, the listed attendance is 94,118. As of 2008, the Rose Bowl is the 11th largest football stadium, and is still the largest stadium that hosts post-season bowl games. For concerts held there, the Rose Bowl holds almost 60,000 people. The stadium's 2014 remodeling removed the lower \"lettered row\" seats on each side behind the players' benches and provide access in and out of the stadium for the lower sections of the Rose Bowl, restoring its original design.\n\nThe press box was updated before the 1962 Rose Bowl with an elevator and two rows. The cost was $356,000. The Press Box was refurbished for UCLA's move in 1982 and the 1984 Summer Olympics. In 2011 and 2012, the press box was undergoing renovation as part of the larger renovation originally budgeted at $152 million in 2010. Costs had increased to $170 million during construction. Work proceeded during the 2011 football season, and was expected to be completed before the UCLA Bruins' first home game in 2012. Some unforeseen problems had been encountered due to the stadium's age and some renovations done in the early 1990s. Most of the planned renovations were completed in 2013. Because of the increased construction cost, items deferred for the future are additional new restrooms, the historic field hedge, new entry gate structures, and additional new concession stands. The stadium has started \"The Brick Campaign\" to help pay for some of the cost of the renovations. The Brick Campaign, completed in 2014, features a large logo of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses and the donor bricks arranged by universities in front of the south main entrance to the stadium. A large 30 feet tall by 77 feet wide LED video display board was added to the north end of the stadium as a part of the renovation.\n\nThe Court of Champions is at the stadium's south end. Rose Bowl game records along with the names of the coaches and the MVP players, are shown on the plaques attached to the exterior wall. The Hall of Fame statue is also at the Court of Champions. The 2014 renovation allows more plaques to be placed on the wall and floor for future games.\n\nThe seven-story Terry Donahue Pavilion is named for the former UCLA football head coach, who is the most successful coach in UCLA and Pac-12 history. It houses the press boxes, broadcast booths, premium seating, boxes and suites. The radio and TV booths will be renamed \"The Keith Jackson Broadcast Center\" in December 2015. Jackson, the former ABC-TV sportscaster, coined the phrase \"The Granddaddy of Them All\" for the Rose Bowl game.\"\n\nIn 1999, \"Sports Illustrated\" listed the Rose Bowl at number 20 in the Top 20 Venues of the 20th Century. In 2007, Sports Illustrated named the Rose Bowl the number one venue in college sports.\n\nThe Rose Bowl stadium is best known in the U.S. for its hosting of the Rose Bowl, a postseason college football game. The game is played after the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year's Day, or, if January 1 is a Sunday, on the following Monday January 2. The stadium's name has given rise to the term \"bowl game\" for postseason football games, regardless of whether they are played in a bowl-shaped or \"Bowl\"-named stadium. The Rose Bowl Game is commonly referred to as \"The Granddaddy of Them All\" because of its stature as the oldest of all the bowl games. Since its opening, the Rose Bowl stadium has hosted the bowl game every year except the 1942 Rose Bowl, when the game was moved to Durham, North Carolina, at the campus of Duke University. Duke, which played in the game on January 1, volunteered to host the contest because of security concerns on the West Coast in the weeks following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Since 1945, the Rose Bowl has been the highest attended college football bowl game.\n\nStarting with the 1998 season, the Rose Bowl became part of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The 2002 and 2006 games also were the BCS Championship games, matching the #1 and #2 BCS teams in the nation. The 2010 BCS National Championship Game was played six days after the Rose Bowl game as a completely separate event from the Tournament of Roses, though it managed the event. The stadium hosted the 2014 BCS National Championship Game, the final game before the BCS was replaced by the current College Football Playoff, when it celebrated its 100th anniversary of the Rose Bowl game.\n\n\"Note: *USC later vacated all wins during the season.\"\n\nThough the Rose Bowl is eligible to bid on hosting the College Football Playoff Championship Game in years it is not hosting a semifinal, it has no plans to do so.\n\nThe Rose Bowl Game is one of the six primary bowls of the College Football Playoff (CFP), which replaced the BCS effective with the 2014 season. Every three years, the Rose Bowl will match two of the top four teams selected by the system's selection committee to compete for a spot at the national championship game. The first CFP semifinal game at the Rose Bowl was the 2015 Rose Bowl, whose winner advanced to the championship game on January 12 at AT&T Stadium in Texas.\n\nThe Rose Bowl stadium has been the home football field for UCLA since 1982. The UCLA Bruins had played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since 1928. There was an attempt to build a 44,000 seat stadium on campus, at the site where Drake Stadium eventually was built. However, the proposal was blocked by influential area residents, as well as other politicians.\n\nAt the start of the 1982 NFL season, with the Oakland Raiders scheduled to move in, UCLA decided to relocate its home games to the Rose Bowl Stadium. The Bruins went on to play two straight Rose Bowl games in their new home stadium, the 1983 Rose Bowl and the 1984 Rose Bowl. UCLA has participated in five Rose Bowl games since moving to the stadium. The stadium is the host of the UCLA–USC rivalry football game on even numbered years, alternating with the Coliseum. In the first rivalry game at the stadium between UCLA and USC in 1982, USC fans sat on the west side of the stadium and UCLA fans sat on the east side of the stadium, mirroring an arrangement that existed when the teams shared the Coliseum. Both teams also wore their home uniforms. In 1984, USC fans were moved to the end zone seats, which ended the tradition of shared stadium. Because of the shared arrangement, and the participation of USC in a number of Rose Bowl games, both schools have winning records in each other's home stadium. The Bruins travel 26 miles from campus to Pasadena to play home games, but only 14 miles to their biggest road game at USC every other year.\n\nCaltech, a university located in Pasadena, played most home games in the Rose Bowl from the time of its construction until the school dropped football in 1993. Caltech jovially claimed to play before the greatest number of empty seats in the nation.\n\nThe stadium hosted the Junior Rose Bowl from 1946 to 1971 and 1976 to 1977. Between 1946 and 1966 and 1976 and 1977, the game pitted the California Junior College football champions against the NJCAA football champions for the national championship. It was organized by the Pasadena Junior Chamber of Commerce. The Junior Rose Bowl became the Pasadena Bowl from 1967 to 1971; it was billed as the Junior Rose Bowl the first two years, but instead two teams from the NCAA College Division competed (then later the University Division, usually featuring teams that were not invited to other major bowls).\n\nThe Rose Bowl stadium is the only site west of the Mississippi River to host an Army–Navy Game (1983). The city of Pasadena paid for the traveling expenses of the all students and supporters of both the U.S. Naval Academy and U.S. Military Academy. The attendance was 81,000. The game was brought to the Rose Bowl as there are a large number of military installations and servicemen and women, along with many retired military personnel, on the West Coast.\n\nThe stadium has hosted the Super Bowl five times. The first was Super Bowl XI in January 1977, when the Oakland Raiders beat the Minnesota Vikings 32–14. The game was also played there in 1980 (XIV), 1983 (XVII), 1987 (XXI) and 1993 (XXVII). The Rose Bowl is one of two venues (with Stanford Stadium) to host a Super Bowl though having never served as the full-time home stadium for an NFL or AFL team (Stanford Stadium hosted one San Francisco 49ers game after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake).\n\nBecause the NFL has a policy limiting the hosting of a Super Bowl to metropolitan areas with NFL teams, the Super Bowl has not been played at the Rose Bowl since the Rams and Raiders departed the Los Angeles area in . The most recent Super Bowl held in southern California was XXXVII in San Diego in January 2003. The next L.A.-based Super Bowl (LVI) is scheduled for February 2022 at the Rams' and Chargers' new stadium in Inglewood (the Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016, the Chargers the following year).\n\nThough best known as an American football stadium, the Rose Bowl is also one of the most decorated soccer (association football) venues in the world. The stadium hosted the prestigious 1994 FIFA World Cup Final (an event watched by over 700 million people worldwide), the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final, and the 1984 Olympic Gold Medal Match, making it the only venue in the world to host all three of international soccer's major championship matches. The United States men's national soccer team has played 17 games in the Rose Bowl, the fourth most of any venue. It has also hosted MLS Cup 1998 and the 2002 and 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup Finals. Mexico has played a number of friendlies in the stadium against nations other than the United States.\n\nIn the past, it was also the home ground of two North American Soccer League clubs, the Los Angeles Wolves in 1968 and the Los Angeles Aztecs in 1978 and 1979. From 1996 through 2002, the stadium was the home ground of Major League Soccer club Los Angeles Galaxy, who still host occasional matches there.\n\nThe Rose Bowl is one of two stadiums to have hosted the FIFA World Cup finals for both men and women. The Rose Bowl hosted the men's final in 1994 and the women's final in 1999. (The only other stadium with this honor is the Råsunda Stadium near Stockholm, Sweden, which hosted the men's final in 1958 and the women's final in 1995.) Both Rose Bowl finals were scoreless after extra time and decided on penalty shootouts; Brazil defeating Italy in the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final, and the United States defeating China in the 1999 women's final.\n\nThe Rose Bowl also hosted group stage matches of the Copa América Centenario in 2016. It also hosted several matches including the final of the 1984 Olympics men's soccer tournament. On July 27, 2016, the Rose Bowl hosted a 2016 International Champions Cup match between Chelsea and Liverpool. Chelsea won the match 1-0. The Rose Bowl also hosted a 2018 International Champions Cup match between F.C. Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur where Barcelona won 5-3 in penalty kicks after a 2-2 draw. It has also regularly featured CONCACAF Gold Cup matches including two finals.\n\nThe Rose Bowl is a candidate to host matches in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and will be a venue in the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe Rose Bowl has hosted the Pasadena \"Americafest\" Independence Day celebration annually since 1927. The annual fireworks show is considered one of the top fireworks shows in the nation. Another local event is the Rose Bowl Flea Market held the second Sunday of each month, on the stadium parking lots. Hosted by promoter R.G. Canning, it claims to be the largest Flea market on the West Coast. The stadium host the annual \"Turkey Tussle\" homecoming football game between John Muir High School and Pasadena High School, in early November. The Rose Bowl hosted its annual graduation ceremonies for Blair High School, John Muir High School and Pasadena High School until 1984, before staging it at the individual schools until 1998. Currently all three high schools along with John Marshall Fundamental School held their graduation ceremonies at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in early June.\n\nThe Rose Bowl was the track cycling venue for the 1932 Summer Olympics.\n\n! width=12% style=\"background:#ED1C24; color:#FFFFFF; border:2px solid #008348;\"|Date\n! width=10% style=\"background:#ED1C24; color:#FFFFFF; border:2px solid #008348;\"|Performer(s)\n! width=10% style=\"background:#ED1C24; color:#FFFFFF; border:2px solid #008348;\"|Opening act(s)\n! width=16% style=\"background:#ED1C24; color:#FFFFFF; border:2px solid #008348;\"|Tour/Event\n! width=10% style=\"background:#ED1C24; color:#FFFFFF; border:2px solid #008348;\"|Attendance\n! width=20% style=\"background:#ED1C24; color:#FFFFFF; border:2px solid #008348;\"|Notes\n"}

{"id": "1220922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1220922", "title": "Skins game", "text": "Skins game\n\nA skins game is a type of scoring for various sports. It has its origins in golf but has been adapted for disc golf, curling and bowling.\n\nIn golf, a skins event has players compete for prize money on each individual hole. \n\nThere was an annual skins game for male professional golfers which took place in November or December each year after the end of the official PGA Tour season (1983–2008). It was recognized by the PGA Tour but did not count towards the official money list.\n\nThere is an annual skins game in Canada for male professional golfers which takes place in June or July each year. It is recognized by the PGA Tour but does not count towards the official money list. It is currently sponsored by Telus and is officially known as the Telus World Skins Game, hosted at a different golf course each year within Canada. \n\nOver the past two years the Telus Skins Game has also incorporated a theme, which has been a \"world\" theme. The \"world\" theme incorporates 5 golfers located from different regions across the globe (5 golfers from different countries).\n\nThe popularity of the tournament led to the term \"skins game\" being used to refer to progressive jackpot events where if a prize is not won, it is carried over to the next round for a combined jackpot.\n\nAt least in the early versions of the Jack Nicklaus Golf series of computer games, players were given a choice of stroke play or Skins rules (and in the initial set-up of a game, could set any value for any hole).\n\nA skins game format has also been adapted to the game of curling. In this format, teams play for ends, not scoring within an end, though points (or in some competitions, prize money as in golf's version) may be assigned to each end. To win an end, the team that has \"the hammer\" — the one which throws the last stone in the end, an inherent advantage — must score at least two points (under normal scoring rules) to win the end. The other team may win the end by stealing one point. If the team with the hammer gets only one point or the end is blanked, then the game points or prize money associated with that end carry over to the next, as with the golf skins game. If there are unclaimed skins after the final end, they are usually played off with a \"draw to the button\" — each team throws a single stone into an empty house (target), with the stone coming closest to the button (center) winning.\n\nScoring in curling skins games is done in one of two methods: in one method, an \"S\" is denoted if a team wins a skin, and a \"C\" is denoted for the team with the hammer if there is a carryover. In any event, a \"0\" is denoted for the other team, and an asterisk is placed beside the team with the hammer. In the other method, an \"X\" is denoted if a team wins a skin, and a \"0\" is denoted if the skin is carried over (under the team with the hammer), with the other team's entry for the end being blank. This method, however, does not keep track of which team will have the hammer in an end (which instead must be determined based on the score markings).\n\nThe Continental Cup of Curling is the best-known bonspiel to utilize the skins format. In this bonspiel, the skins portion is played for a total of 30 points, with point values assigned to each end as follows: One half point each for the first six ends, one point each for the seventh and eighth ends. There are 6 skins games with 5 skins available each game. These points are combined with those earned in earlier matches of mixed doubles, singles skills and traditional team games to determine the winner of the Cup. \n\nThe TSN Skins Game was an annual tournament which featured skins games. The Network was restarted in 2007.\n\nThe Skins Game was thought to have been invented by Doug Maxwell, a noted innovator in the sport. Early skins games often consisted of ten ends, the standard length of a modern competitive curling game. Today, largely on account of the influence of television, eight end games (the usual length of a recreational or semi-competitive curling game) has become the standard for skins competition.\n\n"}

Multiple efforts were made in the 1960s to start women's football clubs in South Africa, but they proved fleeting. The 1970s saw some growth, with new women's leagues in Nigeria and an expansion of women's football into Western African countries, including Senegal. One local club in Dakar played a match against an Italian club in 1974; five years later, an early match between African nations was played by the Dakar side and a team from Guinea.\n\nDespite a lack of support from Nigerian officials, 28 clubs played women's football in the country by 1989, and Nigeria's national team competed in the 1991 Women's World Cup. More women began playing football in the 1990s, in countries like Nigeria and South Africa. In 1998, CAF introduced an official African Women's Championship, following two unofficial versions of the tournament earlier in the 1990s; host country Nigeria won, beginning a stretch of five consecutive titles in the event.

Built in 1933, as a World War I War memorial in the form of a multi-purpose hall, the Auditorium has a , proscenium. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as part of the Institutional District.\n\nIn 2009 Lincoln Square was listed as one of the \"Most Endangered Historic Resources\" in the state by Preservation Massachusetts because of the three historical buildings in the square that are all empty or underutilized. The Auditorium was most recently used to house Massachusetts State Trial Court records and a small after-school program.\n\nThe Worcester Auditorium was designed as a World War I War memorial in the form of a multi-purpose hall. The building is built in the Classical Revival style, but with Art Deco bas-relief ornamentation. The interior murals in the Auditorium were created by the artist Leon Kroll, and took three years to complete between 1938 and 1941. When finished the main mural was the largest of its kind in the United States.\n\nSince the Auditorium opened, it has been home to the Bay State Bombardiers of the Continental Basketball Association and the Holy Cross Crusaders before the Hart Center opened in 1975. It has also hosted Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue and has served as a shelter after the Worcester tornado hit. There is another small performance space known as the \"Little Theater\" attached to the Auditorium, which can seat 675 people, but it is currently empty as well.\n\nIn 2013, a scene for the film American Hustle was filmed in the Worcester Auditorium.\n\nMany plans have been weighed for the future of the Auditorium. These included a canceled plan for Higgins Armory to move to the Auditorium from its current location, the creation of a Faneuil Hall style marketplace, and even the creation of a research center because of the proximity of Worcester Polytechnic Institute's nearby Gateway Park. One of the largest problems with the Auditorium is that it has a flat, as opposed to a sloped audience floor, which makes it not well suited to be a modern theater. To convert the Auditorium to office space would cost $6.2 million, while converting it to a \"museum, memorial or theater\", would cost more than $12 million, much of which could be covered by tax credits. While some call for the demolition of the Auditorium, even a partial one that would spare the memorial wall and murals, they are a tiny minority. In 2016, renewed efforts were launched to rekindle interest and appreciation for the building and its 106-rank Kimball Pipe Organ.\n\n"}
