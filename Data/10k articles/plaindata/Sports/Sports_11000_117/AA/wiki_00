{"id": "1009736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1009736", "title": "12th man (football)", "text": "12th man (football)\n\nThe 12th man or 12th player is a term for fans of teams in eleven-a-side sports games, particularly association football (soccer) or American football. As most football leagues allow a maximum of eleven players per team on the playing field at a time, referring to a team's fans as the 12th man implies that they have a potentially helpful role in the game. Infrequently, the term has referred to individuals having a notable connection to their football team. In Canadian football, 12 players are usually on the field at one time and the term 13th man is often used to refer to fans. Similarly, in Australian rules football, 18 players are on the field and the fans are often referred to as the 19th man. The term has a different meaning in cricket, referring instead to the first substitute player who fields when a member of the fielding side is injured (the term 6th man has a similar connotation in basketball).\n\nThe presence of fans can have a profound impact on how the teams perform, an element in the home advantage. Namely, the home team fans would like to see their team win the game. Thus these fans will often create loud sounds or chant in hopes of distracting, demoralizing and confusing the opposing team while they have possession of the ball; or to persuade a referee to make a favorable decision. Noises are made by shouting, whistling, stomping and various other techniques.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term \"twelfth man\" was a magazine published by the University of Minnesota in September, 1900, that referred to \"the mysterious influence of the twelfth man on the team, the rooter.\" Later, in the November 1912 edition of The Iowa Alumnus, an alumni publication of the University of Iowa (then known as State University of Iowa), E.A. McGowan described the 1903 game between Iowa and the University of Illinois. In his article, titled \"The Twelfth Player\" McGowan wrote: \"The eleven men had done their best; but the twelfth man on the team (the loyal spirited Iowa rooter) had won the game for old S.U.I.\"\n\nThe 1922 Dixie Classic served as the setting for an event later referred to as \"The story of the 12th Man.\" This football game featured the top-ranked Centre College and The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (later known as Texas A&M). During the game, A&M coach Dana X. Bible realized that one more injury would leave him without another backfield player to send into the game. . Bible called E. King Gill, a sophomore basketball player, down from the stands to stand ready as a substitute. Gill was ready in uniform on the sidelines if his team ever needed him. Gill never went in the game, but his spirit that lives on in the \"12th Man.\" \n\nIndividuals have occasionally been labeled by local media as the \"Twelfth Man\" of their team. In 1930, W. H. Adamson, Principal of Oak Cliff (Dallas) High School was called the \"Twelfth Man\" of the school's American football team by a local reporter due to the rousing pre-game speeches he would give to the players.\n\nIn the 1935 Princeton- game before 56,000 fans who braved the snow and cold, spectator Mike Mesco was initially reported to have left his seat from the stands to join the Dartmouth defensive line and was referred to in a local newspaper as the \"Twelfth Dartmouth Man.\" As it turned out it was not Mesko but George Larsen of Cranford, N.J., who dashed from the stands to aid Dartmouth in her game with Princeton. Asa Bushnell III, Princeton class of 1947, wrote of the incident in 1960 for the Princeton Athletic News: \"Strange as it may seem, it was a young architect from Cranford, N.J., a refugee from the University of Cincinnati, no less - who immortalized the activities in Palmer Stadium on November 23, 1935. It was he who, midway through the fourth period that tingling afternoon, left the other 55,999 spectators in their seats to assist the Dartmouth Indians in a determined goal-line stand. It was he who lined up with the Hanoverians on the two yard stripe and prevented Jack White from scoring - and White boasted interference from the awesome likes of Johnny Weller and Homer Spofford. It was the daring \"twelfth man\" who, though escorted unceremoniously off the field and out of the stadium without further ado, gained a nationwide American football reputation in a single play.\"\n\nThe December 18, 1938, \"Dallas Morning News\" said \"Whether they play now on a team, used to play back in the day, follow the game closely or just quarterback from the grandstand occasionally, every American football enthusiast well knows how much that twelfth man in the stands means to any American football team. But that backing means unusually much in the traditional Thanksgiving game between the University of Texas and Texas A&M. With an uncertain monotony that has long since made game forecasters exceedingly skittish, these two win where their twelfth men help most.\" Thus, in this single instance, the term \"Twelfth Man\" was used to refer to the fans of both schools playing.\n\nThe term \"12th man\" is commonly used in football to refer to the fans and occasionally the manager. A notable club famous for the twelfth man reference comes from Aston Villa, referring to the Holte End stand at Villa Park. Large European and Asian teams such as Bayern Munich, Foolad, Malmö FF, Hammarby IF, Werder Bremen, Aberdeen, Rangers, Paris Saint-Germain, Lazio, Feyenoord, Ferencvárosi TC, FC Red Star, Fenerbahçe S.K., and Sporting CP have officially retired the number 12 to the fans. Stockport County fans are registered as official members of their squad with the number 12. Portsmouth F.C. has also retired its number 12 shirt, and lists the club's supporters, \"Pompey Fans\", as player number 12 on the squad list printed in home match programmes, while Plymouth Argyle have theirs registered to the \"Green Army\" (the nickname for their fans). Number 12 is also reserved for the fans at many other clubs, including CSKA Moscow and Zenit Saint Petersburg in Russia, Bristol Rovers and Grimsby Town in England, as well as Aarhus Gymnastikforening (AGF), Odense Boldklub, also known as OB, in Denmark, Malmö FF and Hammarby IF in Sweden and Perth Glory in Australia. On Hammarby IF's, Feyenoord and Werder Bremen's home games, the stadium speaker announces number 12 as \"the fans\" during team lineup announcements.\n\nDynamo Dresden in Germany also keeps number 12 for their fans, as well as the official team anthem being \"We are the 12th man\". Aberdeen F.C. supporters commonly display a large banner in the shape of a football shirt with the text \"Red Army 12\" in place of a player's name and number. The fans of the Northern Ireland national football team and Derry City are referred to as the 12th man as well. In the League of Ireland Shamrock Rovers F.C. retired the number 12 jersey in recognition of the fans who took over the club in 2005. Cork City F.C., Clube Atlético Mineiro and Clube de Regatas do Flamengo also retired the number 12 for the fans. The most vociferous fans of Boca Juniors in Argentina are known as the \"Jugador Numero 12\" (Spanish for \"Player Number 12\") or simply \"La Doce\" (\"The 12\"). On September 18, 2004, U.S. Lecce, an Italian team currently playing in Serie A, retired the number 12 to the fans, which was handed to them by the former captain Cristian Ledesma. They symbolically represent a 12th Man in the field. In the beginning of 2009/2010 season, Happy Valley AA introduced the club's mascot, a panda, on squad list as the fan club captain wearing the number 12 jersey. As of the end of the 2011/2012 season Rangers F.C announced that the number 12 jersey would be retired in honour of the fans support throughout a period of financial difficulty.\n\nThe term has been used by various American football teams including the University of Minnesota, the University of Iowa, Baylor University, Dartmouth College, Simmons College, Texas A&M and the NFL's Seattle Seahawks, Green Bay Packers, Buffalo Bills, Denver Broncos, Washington Redskins, Indianapolis Colts, Miami Dolphins, and Chicago Bears in marketing practices in reference to their supporters. The Bears currently use the phrase \"4th Phase\" (with the first three phases being offense, defense, and special teams), and the Seahawks currently use the phrase \"The 12s.\" \n\nMany high schools in the United States incorporate 12th Man language into their booster, supporter, or rooter clubs. Examples of such \"12th Man Clubs\" include the Alta Loma Braves, Dana Hills Dolphins, Washington Panthers, Richwood Knights, Diamond Bar Brahmas, Fairfield Falcons, and Brentwood Bruins.\n\nThe Campbellsville University Tigers of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics also have a 12th Man Club.\n\nOn December 12, 1992, (12/12/1992) the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League honored their 12th Man as the seventh inductee into the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame, located inside of New Era Field. Their fans were inducted because of their loyal support during the team's early '90s Super Bowl runs. In 2008, the Bills renamed their \"12th Man Walk of Fame\" as \"Tim Russert Plaza,\" in honor of the Buffalo native and lifelong fan. The team continues to refer to their fans as the \"12th Man,\" with their independent, international fan clubs known as \"Bills Backers Chapters.\" The Bills have a licensing agreement with Texas A&M over the use of the \"12th Man\" term.\n\nFans of the Indianapolis Colts of the NFL are known as the 12th Man. The Colts created a Ring of Honor on September 23, 1996, after playing 13 seasons in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 2007, the Colts inducted their 12th Man as the sixth entrant into the team's Ring of Honor, then located on the interior facade of the RCA Dome. The Ring of Honor currently encircles Lucas Oil Stadium, the team's home venue. The organization also designates a \"12th Man Fan of the Game\". On November 12, 2015, Texas A&M announced the filing of a lawsuit against the Colts based on the team's usage of the term. On February 17, 2016, the lawsuit was settled with the Colts agreeing to remove the phrase from their Ring of Honor and to immediately cease all other uses of the trademarked phrase.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks retired the number 12 jersey on December 15, 1984, in honor of their fans. In 2003, the Seahawks installed a giant flagpole in the south end zone of what is now CenturyLink Field, and began a tradition of raising a giant flag with the number 12 on it in honor of the fans, but one of whom is Sam Adkins, the former Seahawks quarterback who did wear the number 12. Usually, a local celebrity or a season ticket holder raises the flag during pregame ceremonies. In recent years, 12th Man flags have been seen all over Seattle whenever the Seahawks make the playoffs, including atop the Space Needle. In 2014, Boeing painted a Boeing 747-8 freighter with a special Seahawks livery, with the number 12 on the tail, and they later flew it over eastern Washington in a flight path spelling the number 12. When the Seahawks took the field for Super Bowl XLVIII, they were led by LB Heath Farwell carrying the team's 12th Man flag per team tradition.\n\nThe Seahawks' 12th Man has twice set the Guinness World Record loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers\n\nThe first known instance of Texas A&M referring to its fanbase as the \"12th Man\" is contained on page 17 of 25 November 1921 edition of \"The Battalion\", the Texas A&M campus newspaper. Ever since the day E. King Gill left the stands in 1922, the entire student body has stood throughout the game to symbolize their \"readiness, desire, and enthusiasm\" to take the field if needed. A statue of E. King Gill stands on the campus.\n\nFootball coach Jackie Sherrill created the \"12th Man Kick-Off Team\" in the 1980s, composed of non-athletic scholarship students who tried out for the team. Coach Sherrill has written a book entitled \"No Experience Required\" which details this team and the tradition. These students were placed on the roster for the sole purpose of kickoffs. The squad was nicknamed \"the suicide squad\". These students often had little regard for their safety and were determined to make a tackle at any cost. The 12th Man Kick-Off Team was extremely successful and eventually held opponents to one of the lowest yards-per-return average in the league during kickoffs. Later, head coach R. C. Slocum changed the team to allow only one representative of the 12th Man on the kick off team who wears uniform number 12. The player is chosen based on the level of determination and hard work shown in practices. Under Dennis Franchione, the 12th Man Kick-Off Team composed of walk-ons was brought back, though used only rarely when the team was up by quite a few points.\n\nOn June 30, 2014, Texas A&M bought the domain name 12thman.com, which then became its official athletics website.\n\nIn 1986, the Washington Redskins released a video entitled \"Thanks to the 12th Man\". A blogger on NFL.com considered it to be among the worst sports videos of all time.\n\nIn American football, the sideline is sometimes also referred to as the \"12th man\" or \"12th defender\": since a player is considered down when he steps out of bounds, the sideline effectively acts as an extra defender. This usage is less common than the one referring to the fans. The term can also be construed to mean the referee, implying that the match official favours one team and is not impartial.\n\nThe effects of the \"12th man\" vary widely, but can be put in two categories. The first is simply psychological, the effect of showing the home team that they are appreciated, and showing the away team that they are somewhat unwelcome. The second directly relates to the deafening effects of a loud crowd.\n\nIn association football, the crowd is very passionate and often sing throughout the whole match. Some occasions where the crowd noise is extra loud can be before kickoff; during the buildup to and scoring of a goal; when encouraging the team to come back from defeat; to discourage an opposition penalty taker; or to harass a referee giving a free kick to the opposition team.\n\nIn American football, fans are most incited by physical play, especially good plays made by the defense. Additionally, the home team can derive energy from the loud noise of their fans; former American football players have described the feeling of their adrenaline pumping after hearing the fans yell, which is \"like you have a reserve energy tank.\"\n\nThe noise of the crowd can have a significant impact on the players on the field. In American football, an extremely loud crowd can prevent the offensive linemen from hearing the snap count. This can have the effect of making the player slower to react when the ball is snapped, and his eventual response may be weaker than normal because each play is begun \"with some indecision and doubt\". The noise can also prevent players from hearing audibles and can make it difficult for the team's offense to coordinate plays in the huddle. The effect of the noise can often be measured in mistakes, such as false start penalties.\n\nCoaches can take steps to minimize the effect of the crowd noise on their teams. Some American football teams bring large speakers to their practice fields and broadcast loud noises such as jet engines to prepare their teams for the anticipated noise level. Crowd noise tends to diminish after a long lull in play, such as a pause for instant replay. Former NFL player Brian Baldinger speculates that some coaches draw out reviews as part of a coaching strategy to quiet the crowd for their next play.\n\nA researcher from Harvard University discovered in a study that some football referees appeared to be impacted by crowd noise. His studies revealed that a home team acquired an additional 0.1 goal advantage for every 10,000 fans in the stadium.\n\nDelia Smith, Norwich City's joint major shareholder, received some attention when she took to the pitch during a half time interval, with a microphone in hand and Sky TV cameras in tow, to tell fans the side \"need their twelfth man\". \"Where are you?\" she cried. Norwich City lost the game in the final seconds, but Smith's passion worked to increase the affection the fans held for her.\n\nThe current naturally loudest football stadium is the Turk Telecom Arena, in Turkey, host of the Galatasaray team. As a prepared attempt, the current world record for crowd noise at an athletic event was set on September 29, 2014, when the Kansas City Chiefs hosted the New England Patriots. Noise during that event reached a high of 142.2 decibels during a timeout.\n\nTexas A&M University applied on December 26, 1989, for trademark U.S. Ser. No. related to usage of the term. The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the September 4, 1990, to Texas A&M. Four additional Trademark claims related to the \"12th Man\" term were also filed and granted at later dates by Texas A&M University (See U.S. Ser. Nos. , , and ), the first three of which have achieved Incontestable Status as a result of its section 15 affidavit with the Patent and Trademark Office. According to former Texas A&M Athletic Director Bill Byrne, he contacted the Chicago Bears and Buffalo Bills about halting their \"12th Man\" themes. Byrne stated that, \"they responded quickly with our requests to stop using our Twelfth Man trademark.\" Texas A&M sent requests to stop using the phrase to the Seattle Seahawks in both 2004 and 2005. The Seahawks did not respond to the requests.\n\nIn January 2006, Texas A&M filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the Seattle Seahawks and in May 2006, the dispute was settled out of court. Neither side admitted any fault or liability. In the agreement, the Seahawks licensed the phrase in exchange for $100,000, along with public acknowledgement as to Texas A&M's ownership rights of the phrase, and an additional annual fee. The compensation amounted to $5,000 per year. The agreement, which expired in 2016, limited the Seahawks' usage to seven western states and forbid them from selling any \"12th Man\" merchandise. In August 2015, the Seahawks shifted towards calling their fans the \"12s\", and replaced their \"Home of the 12th Man\" stadium sign with a new \"Home of the 12s\" sign.\n\nOn November 12, 2015, Texas A&M filed suit against the Indianapolis Colts after repeated cease and desist requests were ignored by the NFL club. On February 17, 2016, the lawsuit was settled with the Colts agreeing to remove the phrase from their Ring of Honor and to immediately cease all other uses of the trademarked phrase.\n\nIn August 2016, the Seahawks agreed to a new five year trademark licensing agreement with Texas A&M. As part of the agreement, the Seahawks agreed to pay Texas A&M $140,000 for limited rights to use the trademarked term. This agreement, like the previous agreement, prohibits the Seahawks from using the \"12th Man\" term on any merchandise. The new agreement, however, also prohibits Seattle from using the term on social media, nor are they allowed to use the term on any signage within their stadium, including their Ring of Honor.\n\n\n"}

Buckaroo! is made by Milton Bradley, a division of the toy company Hasbro.\n\nThe game centers on an articulated plastic model of a mule named \"Roo\" (or \"Buckaroo\"). The mule begins the game standing on all four feet, with a blanket on its back. Players take turns placing various items onto the mule's back without causing the mule to buck up on its front legs, throwing off all the accumulated items (the toy has a spring mechanism that is triggered by significant vibration). The player who triggered this buck is knocked out of the game, and play resumes. The winner is the last player remaining in the game. In the (unlikely) event that a player manages to place the last item onto the mule's back without it bucking, that player is the winner.\n\nThe toy has three sensitivity levels that are adjustable via a switch located on the side of the mule's body, under the blanket. The switch adjusts the location of the lever to which the blanket is attached in relation to the trigger mechanism attached to the spring.\n\nThe items which players must place on the mule's back are (variations in names from 2007 UK version in parentheses):\n\nOf these, the saddle must be placed first. It has a number of articulation points on which the subsequent items are hung. These other items may be placed in any order.\n\nIt was originally released in 1970 by Ideal Toy Company using a white mule, this has now been replaced with a brown one.\n\nIn 2006, Buckaroo! was considered dangerous, due to the objects getting flung off the mule when the spring is triggered. On \"Good Morning America\" and CTV News, it was mentioned that an object had hit a child in the eye, in North Carolina, causing the 8-year-old boy to have surgery. The game was discontinued until 2008 when the instructions were adjusted.\n\n\n"}

Following his return, Ulsan won the league that year. Choi also became the top scorer for the Hauzen Cup, which is the Korean League Cup. It seemed definite that Choi would become Ulsan's icon, but he moved to Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma, which made many Ulsan supporters extremely angry at the board.\n\nChoi helped Seongnam become the runner-up that season. However, after his disappointing 2008 season Choi announced he would join the army in 2009, which angered many Seongnam fans. He moved to Gwangju Sangmu, the army team at the beginning of the 2009 season. There, his partnership with Kim Myung-Joong was the core of Gwangju's surprising performance.\n\nIn late 2010, he returned to Seongnam and participated in the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup. He scored in the quarterfinal against United Arab Emirates side Al-Wahda.\n\nChoi moved to Suwon Samsung Bluewings prior to the 2011 season.\n\nChoi was implicated in a match-fixing scandal while playing for the military team, Sangmu. He denied his involvement when media reports raised the allegations about throwing matches, but soon admitted it as the scandal deepened. Consequently, he was tentatively dropped from his team.\n\nIt was officially announced in August 2011 that he would not be able to play in the all league systems in South Korea permanently.\n\nOn 16 January 2012, it was announced that Choi would join Macedonian side FK Rabotnički It was to be his first club in Europe of his career. However, his move fell through after the Football Federation of Macedonia rejected the player's registration after K-League revealed Choi had been banned from playing professional football in any league by FIFA. As of 16 March 2012, Choi Sung-Kuk future football career is in doubt.\n\n"}

During this time the Dual Box became one of the most recognized and successful frame designs in speed skating, with 45 athletes winning their Gold, Silver and Bronze medals at the 2001 World Speed Skating Championship on the frames.\n\nSince 2003, the Rollerblade company has produced Dual Box frames under licence from Mogema and has specified Dual Box technology in their high-performance skate product lines.

{"id": "1892274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892274", "title": "Fantasy wrestling", "text": "Fantasy wrestling\n\nFantasy wrestling is an umbrella term representing the genre of role-playing and statistics-based games which are set in the world of professional wrestling. Several variants of Fantasy Wrestling exist which may be differentiated by the way they are transmitted (through websites, message boards, e-mail, postal mail, face-to-face, etc.), the method in which the storyline is determined, (via roleplay, \"angles\", strategy- or statistics-based systems, etc.) and how the roster is composed (are characters created by the players, are real wrestlers \"imported\" into the game, etc.).\n\nFantasy wrestling's roots lie in the play-by-mail wrestling games often featured in professional wrestling magazines that became prominent in the mid-to-late 1980s during one of professional wrestling's boom periods. By the late 1980s, fantasy wrestling games had started to appear on the Internet. In the early 1990s, the advent of national bulletin board services like Prodigy, AOL, and Compuserve allowed players to use e-mail and bulletin boards to more easily trade information and post roleplays. As technology progressed and the internet evolved, fantasy wrestling enthusiasts took advantage, using websites and newsgroups to connect and build broader communities for gameplay.\n\nIn order to begin fantasy wrestling, one must create a custom character. Some people will elect to use pro-wrestlers over their own, custom characters; this can be either allowed or rejected by the administrator of the federation. Usually, one will decide the following: physical appearance (height, weight, sex; these can be copied through \"renders\" - images of pro-wrestlers - or through their imagination/CAW mechanics through wrestling games), moveset (style, signature moves, finishing moves, etc.), fan reaction (heel or face; booed or cheered), and entrance music. Once this is all decided, the character is named and the player can begin to promo in the federation. Some players create multiple characters, either for choice for playing or to freshen the experience/start new.\n\nEarly versions of the game began in the 1980s using play-by-mail formats. Based on the moves and any strategies applied the adjudicator would then decide the outcome. Play-by-mail leagues often included a 'pay to play' model where handlers paid a fee per match and/or 'strategy' applied. The later expansion into email was a natural progression, often using the same mechanics as the pbm format.\n\nIn the late 1980s, e-wrestling got started on the Internet, played by email and often advertised via Usenet, including rec.games.pbm and rec.games.frp. The early games followed the model of a simplified role-playing game with \"combat systems\" of varying complexity, resolved by the Federation Head, or \"Fedhead.\" The role-playing aspect was significant and the fast turn-around of email allowed for collaboration in the creation of \"promos\" and the formation of tag-teams and \"stables\" made up of multiple players. The term e-wrestling was coined about this time, probably by Scott Baxter, since there were enough federations active to require a collective noun. By 1989, there was enough activity for a dedicated Usenet group, rec.sports.pro-wrestling.fantasy, to be created.\n\nEmail play persisted, as was still common enough in 1995 to rate the occasional mention in annual reviews, although not always favourably.\n\nFantasy wrestling expanded in the early 1990s with the rise of nationwide message boards based on PRODIGY, AOL and Compuserve. Originally connected to message boards focused on professional and amateur wrestling, fantasy wrestling's popularity caused specific subforums to be created on PRODIGY's Wrestling BB and AOL's Grandstand. The games based on the online boards had some differences from the federations operating on the Internet via email and Usenet. Many stat-based systems found ways to integrate roleplay as a factor into determining match winners, paralleling similar developments in some of the Internet email federations. Eventually, roleplay became the primary factor for many leagues.\n\nAs the previously isolated message board services began to connect to the Internet, the disparate communities began to overlap, and much of the activity began to migrate to the World Wide Web. The use of roleplay and promos became a larger factor in the operation of many leagues and determining results.\n\nThe first websites featuring fantasy wrestling began to pop up as the World Wide Web started to develop. Early examples include \"The Wild World of e-Wrestling,\" which was devoted to the Internet-based games. and “FW Central,” a site devoted to the PRODIGY-based fantasy wrestling community based on PRODIGY. These sites offered new places for players to interact and expand the hobby, providing online news and resources.\n\nAs the web matured, so did sites devoted to the hobby. The various federations, which had been exclusively text-based, or nearly so, began to integrate Poser images of created wrestlers, animated videos, audio shows, and vlogs.\n\nFantasy wrestling continues to evolve. Traditionally, most roleplays (referred to as \"promos\") revolved around more traditional pro-wrestling topics, focused on trash talking an opponent and hyping an upcoming match, although extensive storylines existed, and gag advertising was fairly common. Longer form roleplay has continued to gain in popularity, resulting in detailed stories and arcs.\n\nHowever, roleplay is not the only form of fantasy wrestling currently available. There are also federations based around angles and booking, there are turn-based sites that allow you and an opponent to alternate between different parts of the match until a moderator decides who wins. Another niche is match-writing federations. Seen as one of the more challenging types, match-writing federations require you to write your match against your opponents and the winner's match is seen as canon. Stat or dice based federations continue to thrive, as well, sometimes deliberately harkening back to the earlier days of the hobby.\n\nAnother method of fantasy wrestling currently used is called \"E-Fedding\" (a slang term for E-Federations, internet groups that identify as fictional companies). Individuals roleplay with promos, written similar to a screenplay of a movie, and the moderators/administrators of the forum/group decide the winner(s) based on the promos written, storylines in play/building, along with other factors that may present themselves. On Facebook, several E-Federations can be found.\n\nSome players have created social media accounts now to live out the lives of their characters in ways a typical roleplay could not show.\n\nIn 2004, World Wrestling Entertainment began its own fantasy wrestling game focused on selecting WWE Superstars as part of a team and receiving points based on their involvement on the WWE television shows. WWE singled out \"real wrestling\" E-Feds who used the names and likenesses of WWE Superstars and began sending them cease-and-desist letters. WWE later disbanded its fantasy wrestling game.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling also operated their own fantasy wrestling game. The game operated from the promotion's message boards and was based on real wrestlers. The game never gained notoriety and was removed along with the message boards from the promotion's website in late 2006. In June 2011, TNA relaunched their fantasy wrestling game as a part of their Impact Wrestling campaign.\n"}

The company was located on Kossuth Street in Bridgeport's East Side, where nearby schoolchildren tossed the plates around and yelled \"Frisbie\" to alert others to avoid the spinning tins. The game the children played made its way to nearby college campuses.\n\nIt has been noted that Frisbie supplied pies to many Connecticut retailers and restaurants, including the Yale University campus. Yale students discovered that the pie tins, inverted, had an airfoil shape which enabled them to be thrown, with practice, in various trajectories.\n\nThe name Frisbie was picked up by Wham-O, a California-based firm who had acquired the rights to the \"Pluto Platter\". As the pie tin was the same shape, it was discovered that children were already using the term for the flying disc and therefore a spelling amendment to avoid trademark infringement gave birth to the name Frisbee.\n\nThe Bridgeport pie factory closed in 1958; Frisbie brand pies were bought out by Table Talk Pies.\n\nIn 2016, Dan O’Connor, a Fairfield, Connecticut resident, Frisbee player, and historian acquired the license and distribution rights to the Frisbie Pie Co. He re-launched the company in November 2016 in Bridgeport, Connecticut and began distributing pies throughout the region in early 2017. They sell pies based on the original Frisbie Pie Company recipe.\n\nIn \"Back to the Future Part III\", Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) while time-travelling to the Wild West, finds amusement in seeing the word \"Frisbie\" at the bottom of a pie plate. He later throws the plate at a derringer held by outlaw Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), foiling his attempt to shoot Doctor Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd).\n\n"}
{"id": "3510191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3510191", "title": "Harpastum", "text": "Harpastum\n\nHarpastum, also known as \"harpustum\", was a form of ball game played in the Roman Empire. The Romans also referred to it as the small ball game. The ball used was small (not as large as a \"follis\", \"paganica\", or football-sized ball) and hard, probably about the size and solidity of a softball. The word \"harpastum\" is the latinisation of the Greek ἁρπαστόν (\"harpaston\"), the neuter of ἁρπαστός (\"harpastos\"), \"carried away\", from the verb ἁρπάζω (\"harpazo\"), \"to seize, to snatch\".\n\nThis game was apparently a romanized version of a Greek game called \"phaininda\" (Greek: φαινίνδα), or of another Greek game called ἐπίσκυρος (\"episkyros\"). It involved considerable speed, agility and physical exertion.\n\nLittle is known about the exact rules of the game, but sources indicate the game was a violent one with players often ending up on the ground. In Greece, a spectator (of the Greek form of the game) once had his leg broken when he got caught in the middle of play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general impression from these descriptions is of a game quite similar to rugby. Additional descriptions suggest a line was drawn in the dirt, and that the teams would endeavor to keep the ball behind their side of the line and prevent the opponents from reaching it. This seems rather like an \"inverted\" form of football. If the opponents had the ball on their side of the line, the objective would seem to be to get in and \"pass\" it to another player, or somehow get it back over the line. The ancient accounts of the game are not precise enough to enable the reconstruction the rules in any detail.\n\nIn an epigram, Martial makes reference to the dusty game of \"harpasta\" in reference to Atticus' preference for running as exercise:\n\"No hand-ball (\"pila\"), no bladder-ball (\"follis\"), no feather-stuffed ball (\"paganica\") makes you ready for the warm bath, nor the blunted sword-stroke upon the unarmed stump; nor do you stretch forth squared arms besmeared with oil, nor, darting to and fro, snatch the dusty scrimmage-ball (\"harpasta\"), but you run only by the clear Virgin water (the Aqua Virgo aqueduct).\"\n\nIn the Croatian town of Sinj, a Roman tombstone found in the ruins of the military camp Tilurium, near the modern day Trilj, shows a boy holding a \"harpastum\" ball in his hands. The ball that is shown on this monument has hexagonal and pentagonal patterns, similar to a modern-day football (soccer).\n\n\n"}

Prior to the opening of Assembly Hall in 1963, it was home to the basketball team as well.\n\nCurrently Huff Hall is used for a variety of sporting events, including men's and women's gymnastics, men's wrestling, and women's volleyball. At each athletic event banners are hung of past Illini heroes to remind the crowd of the rich tradition that Illini athletics have had.\n\nEvery March from 1926 to 1962, Huff Gymnasium played host to the state finals of the Illinois High School Association boys' basketball tournament.\n\nHuff Hall also served as the home of the women's basketball team. Beginning in the 1970s and continuing through the mid-1990s, the team once again used Huff Hall for home games, as it struggled to fill up the Assembly Hall. Since 1997 the team has used the Assembly Hall exclusively, although it struggles with a losing record and to fill up the Assembly Hall.\n\nFrom 1927 to 2002 Huff Hall was also home to a 25-yard swimming pool which served as the home of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign Underwater Hockey club and the University of Illinois Water Polo Club.

It is used in activities such as breakdancing, gymnastics, martial arts, professional wrestling, and freerunning, and in action film fight sequences.\n\nNot only does the kip-up require muscle activation and strength, but it also requires proper technique for successful completion. A practitioner must perform the preparation phase (initiation of movement until directly before flight), aerial phase (time spent in flight), and landing phase (time from touchdown of the feet to maintenance of balanced standing) using specific accelerations, angular velocities, and joint positions of the extremities in order to land on their feet.\n\nThe performer draws both legs (which may be either in extension or flexion) anterior to the chest, rotates back onto the shoulders, and optionally places hands on the floor proximal to the ears. The performer then moves from hip and knee flexion to hip and knee extension while elevating the body away from the floor. The performer creates force against the ground by pushing off with the hands and simultaneously moving the elbows from flexion to extension.\n\nThe leg motion during the thrust involves increasing the joint angle of the hip from flexion to extension. When the thrust is completed, the rotation of the legs with respect to the trunk is terminated and, as a result, the angular momentum of the legs is transferred to the entire body. The linear momentum of the thrust carries the body into the air feet first while the angular momentum causes the airborne body to rotate. The spine moves into greater lordosis so that with sufficient thrust, back curvature, and body rotation, the performer will land on the feet.\n\nWith body face-down, the performer creates forces against the floor with fists or palms while kicking back the legs so as to develop momentum that carries the body into the air. The performer lands with the feet in contact with the floor, and knees in flexion.\n\nHop back variations all involve the practitioner starting in a standing position, possibly jumping in the air and rotating posterior in order to land on their shoulders/back. After maintaining the supine position the practitioner executes the standard kip up variation in order to return to their feet.\n"}

{"id": "2967156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2967156", "title": "Mike Leach (American football coach)", "text": "Mike Leach (American football coach)\n\nMichael Charles Leach (born March 9, 1961) is an American college football coach. He is the head coach of the Washington State Cougars football team. Previously, he was head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team, leading the Red Raiders to winning seasons in every year of his tenure.\n\nBorn to Frank and Sandra Leach in Susanville, California, Mike Leach claims Cody, Wyoming, as his hometown. He graduated from Cody High School before studying at Brigham Young University (BYU), where he closely followed the exploits of the BYU Cougars football team. The Cougars, guided by head coach LaVell Edwards and offensive coordinator Norm Chow, played a pass-oriented offense, which was unique to college football at that time. Leach graduated in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in American studies.\n\nIn 1986, Leach earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from Pepperdine University School of Law. Leach is also one of the most prominent graduates of the United States Sports Academy, from which he earned a Master's of Sports Science in Sports Coaching in 1988. Leach is married with four children. He was raised a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nLeach is atypical among NCAA Division I head football coaches in that he did not play football at the college level. He is one of only four such coaches along with Paul Johnson at Georgia Tech, David Cutcliffe at Duke, and Chad Morris at Arkansas.\n\nFamous among fans for his fascination with 18th-century pirates such as Blackbeard and Calico Jack, Leach has lectured his players on the history of pirates, and told them before games to \"swing their swords.\" His office has been described as a museum of pirate paraphernalia. In particular, Leach admires the teamwork exhibited by pirates: \n\nLeach's affinity for pirates came to bear in a cameo he made on the TV series \"Friday Night Lights\". In the show's fourth season, he portrays a \"random loon\" at a gas station who implores a despondent coach Eric Taylor to \"swing your sword\" and \"find your inner pirate.\"\n\nLeach spends time during each off-season learning as much as he can about various things that interest him. Aside from pirates, he has researched topics such as Native American leader Geronimo, American pioneer Daniel Boone, grizzly bears, chimpanzees, whales, and American artist Jackson Pollock.\n\nLeach is known for building potent offenses, directing passing-oriented teams that have broken school and NCAA records at Valdosta State and Kentucky where he was offensive coordinator under Hal Mumme, developing their \"Air Raid Offense\", at Oklahoma under head coach Bob Stoops, and Texas Tech, where he became head coach in 2000. Leach's spread offense relies heavily on passing and he has seen several of his quarterbacks post NCAA records. At Kentucky he tutored prospect Tim Couch into a No. 1 NFL draft pick. At Oklahoma, Josh Heupel became an NFL draft pick following a year under Leach's tutelage.\n\nLeach's tenure at Texas Tech produced most of the Red Raiders' school leaders in passing and receiving.\n\nThe Leach-coached Red Raiders' best finishes came with three nine-win seasons in 2002, 2005, and 2007 and an 11-win season in 2008. In 2002, Tech swept its in-state conference rivals Baylor, Texas, and Texas A&M for the first time since 1997 and then defeated Clemson, 55–15, in the Tangerine Bowl. It was the Red Raiders' first postseason win since 1995 when they beat the Air Force Falcons in the Copper Bowl. In 2005, the Red Raiders opened their season with a 6–0 record, their best start since 1998. Leach built a strong passing offense at Tech, where the Red Raiders led the NCAA in passing yardage for four years in a row.\n\nHe inserted Kliff Kingsbury at quarterback for three years. Kingsbury broke the NCAA records for completions in a career. Kingsbury was succeeded at the position by B. J. Symons, who produced the most passing yards in a season in NCAA history. Sonny Cumbie followed, leading the Red Raiders to an upset of the then-4th ranked California in the Holiday Bowl. Cody Hodges succeeded Cumbie, and subsequently lead the NCAA in passing. Graham Harrell, the first non-senior starting QB since Kingsbury, struggled early in the 2006 season. However, he showed steady improvement beginning with the game against Iowa State and ended the season with a record-setting comeback victory over the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Harrell also set NCAA records for passes completed in a season and career amongst others.\n\nUnder Mike Leach, Texas Tech was known for its high-scoring offense and come-from-behind victories. A 70–35 win over TCU in 2004 began with TCU leading 21–0 with eight minutes remaining in the second quarter. Before Tech's scoring drives started, a TCU defensive back was caught mouthing into a TV camera, \"They aren't going to score.\" Later in the season, Texas Tech beat Nebraska, 70–10, forcing the Cornhuskers to give up more points in a single game than they had before in their 114-year history. In 2005, the Red Raiders were losing to Kansas State, 13–10, late in the second quarter but won the game 59–20. Also in 2005, Tech had a halftime lead of 14–10 over Texas A&M. By the end of the game, they increased the margin to 56–17. It was the Aggies' worst loss to the Red Raiders in the 64-year-old series.\n\nMike Leach was chosen to coach the South team during the 2007 inaugural Inta Juice North-South All-Star Classic game.\n\nAt the end of the 2008 season, Leach was 76–39 with the Red Raiders, including 7–2 against the Texas A&M Aggies and 2–7 against the Texas Longhorns. With a 5–4 record, he is the all-time winningest coach in postseason play in Tech football history. Leach was one of only sixteen active college football coaches who had never had a losing season after he left Texas Tech. This was followed by a 3–9 season in his seminal year with Washington State. Of those, he is among nine who have been a head coach for at least five seasons.\n\nIn February 2009, Leach signed a three-year contract extension with Texas Tech that would pay him at least $2.5 million per year if he stayed in place through 2013. Leach's guaranteed compensation would have been $1.6 million in 2006, $1.65 million in 2007, $1.75 million in 2008, $1.85 million in 2009 and $2.15 million in 2010.\n\nDuring his post-game press conference after the 2007 game against Texas, Leach used most of his time to rail against the officiating crew for what he felt were bad calls. He speculated that the officials may have favored Texas because the head official lived in Austin, because they were incompetent, or possibly because the conference wanted Texas to appear in a BCS bowl because of the increased appearance fees that such a bowl generates for the conference. Jim Vertuno of the Associated Press wrote \"Leach was upset officials disallowed two Tech touchdowns in the third quarter. The first was overruled when video replay clearly showed the receiver let the ball hit the ground. On the next play, a touchdown pass was negated by a holding penalty. Leach also wanted, but didn't get, a flag for roughing the quarterback.\" The \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\" reported, \"Big 12 policy prohibits coaches from commenting publicly about game officials, so Leach's actions leave him open to reprimand, fine or worse.\" ESPN reported, \"Big 12 official spokesman Bob Burda did not immediately respond to telephone messages seeking comment. Leach's rant will likely draw a fine from the league and possibly a suspension.\"\n\nOn November 13, 2007, the Big 12 fined Leach $10,000, the largest fine in Big 12 history. Leach also received a reprimand and was warned that further violations could result in suspension. In a Big 12 coaches' conference call that day, Leach added that he did not regret making any of the comments. Leach announced that he would appeal the fine. Tech alumni and fans began raising money to aid Leach in paying the penalty in the event that it was upheld. Optionally, the proceeds raised could be used charitably. So, just before Christmas 2007, Leach requested that the nearly $5,000 raised to that point be spent on 400 hams to be given free to families in Lubbock, Texas. Future donations were to go to the university or athletic department. Following the 2008 Gator Bowl, in which Virginia scored twice on penalties against Tech for intentional grounding in the end zone, Leach joked, \"I felt like we had a back there on the one safety, but I don't comment on officiating. I just give out hams is what I do.\"\n\nLeach, along with players Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree were featured on the cover of the 2008 edition of \"Dave Campbell's Texas Football\". The magazine predicted that the 2008 Red Raider football team would be the best in Texas and would challenge for the Big 12 South title. Following a 9–0 beginning to the season, including a win over the undefeated #1 Texas Longhorns, Texas Tech Athletic Director Gerald Myers announced that the university would renegotiate Leach's contract following the conclusion of the football regular season and give him an extension.\n\nThe Red Raiders ended the 2008 regular season with 11 wins and 1 loss, the best in school history. The season also marked the first win over a #1 ranked team. Tech, along with Oklahoma and Texas, shared the Big 12 Conference South division title. On December 2, 2008, the Associated Press named Leach the Big 12 Coach of the Year. He received 16 votes for the honor by the agency's panel, while Texas' Mack Brown got 4. He won co-Coach of the Year honors from the Big 12 coaches; Oklahoma's Bob Stoops received the same recognition for the same season. The \"Dallas Morning News\" named him Coach of the Year as well. He garnered the 2008 George Munger Award, which is given annually to the top college coach of the year by the Maxwell Football Club.\n\nAfter much controversy about how the tie-breaker should be handled between Texas, Oklahoma, and Texas Tech fans, the Red Raiders ended up being left out of the BCS because of a rule that states only two teams from each conference could enter BCS play per season. Oklahoma won the tie-breaker on account of their higher BCS ranking, ultimately losing to Florida in the national championship. Texas Tech also ended up losing that year in the Cotton Bowl to Ole Miss 47–34, making Texas the only team of the three to win their bowl game.\n\nLeach interviewed for the University of Washington head coaching job, which was vacated by Tyrone Willingham. ESPN reported that Leach withdrew his name from the coaching search following his interview. Auburn, where Tommy Tuberville resigned, had also been rumored to have contacted Leach. In an interview with the Associated Press, Tech quarterback Graham Harrell stated that there was a \"great chance\" Leach could leave. Harrell noted that Leach might leave for a newer challenge. After Leach withdrew his name from consideration for the Washington job, Harrell retracted his statements and believed Leach would remain the Red Raiders' coach.\n\nTech athletic director Gerald Myers had indicated that he would give a raise to Leach before Tech's bowl game, which he later negotiated. Leach and the university settled on a 5-year extension worth $12.7 million after months of negotiations over the clauses of the contract.\n\nOn October 31, 2009, after the Red Raiders' win over Kansas, Leach tied his predecessor Spike Dykes as the all-time winningest coach in Texas Tech's 85-year football history. On November 21, 2009, Leach passed Dykes for first all-time on the school's wins list with a win over Oklahoma.\n\nOn December 28, 2009, Leach was suspended indefinitely by Texas Tech pending investigation of alleged inappropriate treatment of Adam James, son of former SMU and New England Patriots running back (and former ESPN college football analyst) Craig James. On December 16, James suffered a concussion. He was examined the next day, and told not to practice that afternoon due to the concussion. According to a James family source, Leach ordered him to stand in the equipment room near the Raiders' practice facility.\nAccording to the \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\", school officials claim they gave Leach an ultimatum to apologize to James in writing by December 28 or Leach would be suspended. His attorney, Ted Liggett, disputed the characterization of events as reported by the university and other news sources, and said that James had been treated reasonably in light of his condition.\n\nLeach immediately sought an injunction that would allow him to coach in the 2010 Alamo Bowl. However, on December 30, Texas Tech fired Leach, calling his refusal to apologize to James \"a defiant act of insubordination.\" This was the day before Leach was reportedly owed an $800,000 tenure bonus and over $1,700,000 for contractual guaranteed income for 2009. Texas Tech lawyers handed a termination letter to Liggett just minutes before the two sides were to appear in a Lubbock courtroom for a hearing. Liggett was also told that Leach would not be allowed to coach in the Alamo Bowl regardless of how the hearing turned out. School officials later said that other incidents had come to light during its investigation of Leach, but declined to elaborate. Defensive coordinator Ruffin McNeill was named interim head coach and led the team during their appearance in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nIn a statement, Leach said that he believed the firing was motivated in part by simmering acrimony over the contract negotiations. He also said he planned to sue Texas Tech for wrongful termination.\n\nOn December 31, Leach spoke with \"The New York Times\" in his first interview since being fired from Texas Tech. He said that he did not know where James had been taken, having only ordered him taken \"out of the light.\" He claimed the controversy stemmed from Craig James' constant lobbying for more playing time for his son, whom he characterized as lazy and feeling entitled.\n\nOn January 8, 2010, Leach formally filed suit against Texas Tech for wrongful termination and other claims. He claimed that school officials not only fired him without cause, but issued defamatory statements in a willful attempt to keep him from being hired elsewhere. During a deposition for the case obtained by the \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\", Adam James admitted under oath that he found the closet incident \"funny.\" In May 2010, District Judge Bill Sowder dismissed all but one of Leach's claims on the grounds of sovereign immunity, but he allowed Leach's claim for breach of contract to proceed, finding that Texas Tech had waived its immunity on this claim by its conduct. The judge also dismissed Leach's claims against three university administrators. Both parties have taken steps to appeal the decision, although Leach's attorneys have said they would drop their appeal if Texas Tech would do likewise and allow the breach of contract claim to proceed to a jury trial. Early in 2011, Texas 7th Court of Appeals ruled that Texas Tech was immune from Leach's claim of breach of contract but that Leach can claim non-monetary reparations; Leach attorney Paul Dobrowski announced his intention to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas.\n\nIn February 2012, The Texas Supreme Court rejected Leach's appeal without comment signifying their belief that Leach's lawsuit(s) were without merit. After that ruling, Texas Tech attorney Dicky Gregg stated \"As we've said from the beginning, we were right on the law and the facts, and the (Texas) Supreme Court has just held that we were correct on the law.\"\n\n\"Friday Night Lights\" series creator Peter Berg has hinted that he has written a movie script for the characters from the TV series that is based on Leach's firing from Texas Tech.\n\nOn August 6, Judge Sowder issued a summary judgement dismissing Leach's lawsuits against ESPN, Spaeth Communications, and Craig James. Leach's attorneys indicated they would appeal.\n\nIn August 2010, Leach joined CBS College Sports Network, where he worked as a color analyst with play-by-play announcer Roger Twibell.\n\nIn 2010, Leach joined host Jack Arute to co-host \"College Football Playbook\" on SiriusXM College Sports Nation Channel 91, which airs weekdays 12 pm – 3 pm ET.\n\nIn 2011, Leach released an autobiographical book, \"Swing Your Sword: Leading the Charge in Football and in Life\", through Diversion Books. The book debuted at #6 on The New York Times Best Seller list.\n\nLeach was considered by many in the national media to be a candidate for the head coaching vacancies at University of Miami, University of Maryland, and University of Minnesota following the 2010 regular season. After at least two interviews at Maryland, he was considered the frontrunner for that job until the administration decided instead to hire Randy Edsall away from University of Connecticut. Leach was mentioned in connection with a number of other vacancies in head-coaching positions during 2011, including Washington State, Arizona, Ole Miss, Kansas, Penn State, and Tulane.\n\nLeach agreed to terms with Washington State on November 30, 2011 and began coaching for the 2012 season. His five-year rollover contract made Leach the fourth-highest paid coach in the Pac-12.\n\nLeach's first season was a controversial one. Washington State was 3–9 overall and 1–8 in Pac-12 play; the lone wins were against FCS Eastern Washington, UNLV, and an upset of rival Washington in the Apple Cup. At the end of the season, more allegations of player abuse erupted on November 10, 2012 when star wide receiver Marquess Wilson quit the team citing \"physical, emotional and verbal abuse\" by the coaching staff. Immediately after the allegations were made, Washington State University President Elson Floyd issued a statement indicating that he had requested investigations into the alleged incident(s) from both the WSU Athletic Department and the Pac-12 Conference. The investigations determined that the claims made against Leach were without merit, and Wilson later recanted the allegations. Leach received a 2-year contract extension on November 18, 2013 after leading the Washington State Cougars to their best record since 2006.\n\nIn 2013, Leach led WSU to a 6–6 regular season that had the Cougars Bowl eligible for the first time since 2003. The Cougars were led on offense by Connor Halliday, who set school and conference records for passing. The Cougars defeated the University of Southern California Trojans, Southern Utah, The Idaho Vandals, The California Golden Bears, Arizona Wildcats, and the Utah Utes for a 4–5 conference record. The Cougars were invited to the New Mexico Bowl where they dropped a close game to the Colorado State Rams 48–45 after leading for much of the game. Leading by 16 points with under three minutes to play, the Colorado State Rams mounted an all-time great comeback, winning with a field goal as time expired in regulation. The Cougars led the nation in passing offense and total offense and Leach was awarded a pay raise for the Cougars 2013 performance.\n\nThe 2014 season saw the Cougars regress back to a 3–9 record. The Cougars defeated Portland State 59–21, Utah 28–27, and Oregon State 39–32.\n\nIn 2015, the Cougars had their breakthrough season of the Leach era with a 9–4 overall, 6–3 Pac-12 record. The Cougars were invited to the Sun Bowl where they beat Miami (FL) 20–14. This was the best Cougar record since the 2003 team went 10–3.\n\nThe Cougars began the season 0-2, but rallied off 8 consecutive wins before dropping their final two games. The success of their season, led by Luke Falk at quarterback, landed them in the Holiday Bowl where they lost to Minnesota 17–12. They finished 7–2 in the Pac-12, with an overall record of 8–5 for 2016. Notable wins occurred against Oregon and #15 Stanford. The 2016 season was the Cougars best finish in Pac-12 conference play since the 2003.\n\nWashington State finished 6-3 in the Pac-12 and 9-4 overall. They were invited to the Holiday Bowl where they lost to Michigan State 42-17.\n\nLeach recruited graduate transfer Gardner Minshew at quarterback in time for the 2018 season and it paid big dividends. The Cougars won a school record-tying 10 games, the first time they had won that many in the regular season since 2002. They also surged as high as seventh in major polling. The Cougars went into the Apple Cup with a chance to clinch the Pac-12 North title and a shot at the Rose Bowl, but lost to rival Washington 28-15.\n\nIn June 2018, from his Twitter account, Leach retweeted a doctored hoax video of Barack Obama's speech, produced by a conspiracy theory website and giving the appearance of Obama saying the opposite of what he actually meant. In the tweet Leach invited his followers to share their thoughts about the video, and he then spent several hours arguing with the critics of the video. Leach removed his original tweet of the video the next day and admitted that the video was ``incomplete\". Leach did not apologize for the original tweet and engaged in a public dispute with the USA Today reporter Dan Wolken, who criticized the tweet, and Leach challenged Woken to a twitter debate. In a subsequent interview to Seattle Times Leach stated that he was “not particularly sorry” for the initial tweet of the video. Shortly after the initial controversy, the Washington State University administration issued a statement saying that “As a private citizen, Mike Leach is entitled to his personal opinions\" and that “Coach Leach’s political views do not necessarily reflect the views of Washington State University students, faculty and staff.” In November 2018 the university President Kirk Schulz and Vice President Phil Weiler confirmed that as result of Leach's tweet about $1.6 million of planned donor estate gifts to Washington State University have been cancelled, although ``no one who had made a cash gift has asked for their money back\".\n\n\n\nAlthough he did not play college football, Leach played wide receiver under John McDougall the long time coach at Cody High School in Cody, Wyoming, Under Coach MacDougall, Cody played in two top division state championships while Leach was a student, winning one in 1976 in triple overtime against legendary coach John Deti's Laramie Plainsmen.\n\nHead coaches under whom Mike Leach served:\n\nAssistant coaches under Mike Leach who became NCAA head coaches:\n\nPlayers under Mike Leach who became NCAA head coaches:\n\n"}

The arena is mostly known for being the home to EuroLeague team Olympiacos, and is the central venue of the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex. It opened in 1985.\n\nThe arena complex also contains a 942-seat amphitheater, a weight training room, a full practice facility, three auxiliary courts that house the Olympiacos youth clubs, and the Olympiacos team office.\n\nThe Peace and Friendship Stadium opened in 1985, and its construction cost was €25,000,000 in 1983 prices. It was designed by the architectural firm \"Thymios Papagiannis and Associates\". The arena is built opposite to the Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus, located in the western end of the Phaleron Bay, in the coastal zone of Attica. It was inaugurated on February 16, 1985, at the first Panhellenic Athletics Indoor Championship, and hosted the 1985 European Athletics Indoor Championships in March. Originally it was designed and operated for a dual use as a ice hockey rink and as basketball stadium. The first Greek Ice Hockey Championship was held in the stadium in 1989. The operation of the skating rink was stopped for the use of other sports.\n\nIn 1991, the arena won the Golden Award from IAKS, the International Association for Sports and Leisure Facilities.\n\nSince the 1991–92 season, the Peace and Friendship Stadium has been the home court to Greek League and EuroLeague professional basketball club Olympiacos. The arena was closed from April 2002, to early 2004, for renovation works, at a total cost of €7,300,000, and hosted the indoor volleyball tournament during the 2004 Summer Olympics. During the period that the arena was closed for renovations, Olympiacos played at the Glyfada Makis Liougas Sportshall, during the 2001–02 season, and at the Korydallos Sports Hall, during the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons.\n\nThe arena's total capacity varies, depending on the collapsible bleachers used in the lower level, besides its 11,640 permanent seating in the mid and upper levels, with additional temporary seating, it currently seats a total of 12,000 people for basketball games.

{"id": "3808989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3808989", "title": "RZD Arena", "text": "RZD Arena\n\nRZD Arena () is a football stadium in Moscow, Russia. It is the home stadium of Lokomotiv Moscow and was the home ground of the Russian National Team for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. The stadium was reconstructed in 2002 and holds 27,320 people, all seated. The reconstruction of the stadium was funded by the Russian Transportation Ministry at a cost of $150–170 million.\n\nIn 1935, at the site where the Lokomotiv Stadium resides today, an electric workers union decided to build a stadium which was named \"Stalinets\" or \"Stalinist Stadium\". At that time Stalinets held about 30,000 spectators.\n\nAfter holding several key matches and establishing itself as a symbol of football in Moscow, Stalinets was demolished to make way for a more modern stadium. Thus, Lokomotiv stadium was built. It was opened on 17 August 1966 with a capacity of 30,000 people. However, in the mid-90's the capacity of the stadium was reduced by 6,000 to 24,000, as the wooden benches were replaced by plastic seats.\n\nThe inaugural match played at the Lokomotiv stadium was between Lokomotiv Moscow and Dynamo Kiev. As years rolled on, Lokomotiv held several important matches such as Russian National team home matches, Lokomotiv matches and others. The stadium also played host to a European Cup Qualifier between FC Spartak Moscow and Swiss club FC Sion. The match finished 2-2; however, the Swiss club then forced UEFA to measure the posts for compliance with international standards. Indeed, the size of the posts were shown to infringe international standards. Eventually, UEFA ordered a replay, which Spartak won 5-1.\n\nDespite the fact that Lokomotiv Stadium was still of good quality, the Lokomotiv Moscow board felt that a new stadium would be the best option. The construction was backed by the Russian Transport Ministry. The new stadium held its first match on July 5, 2002 when Lokomotiv Moscow welcomed Uralan Elista. The home team won 1-0 and the first official goal scored at the new stadium was an own goal by Dmitry Semochko.\n\nOn 5 August 2017, Lokomotiv announced that the stadium has been renamed to RZD Arena following a deal with Russian Railways\n\nLokomotiv was designed solely for football matches and thus has no running tracks. The pitch, which is 104mx68m, is surrounded by two-tiered four all-seater stands, the North Stand, the South Stand, the East Stand and the West Stand. The South Stand is home to the Lokomotiv Moscow ultras. On the other hand, travelling fans generally reside in the North Stand. All the stands are covered by a roof, by thus protecting the fans from the Russian harsh weather elements. The total areas of the glass roof is 20,000 square metres. A unique characteristic of the stadium are the VIP-Boxes found in between the upper and lower tiers of all the stands, with one of them being even a restaurant. Furthermore, the stadium comprises other three VIP-sectors, one of them being of soft-seats. Altogether they total to 974 VIP-seats. Furthermore, there are 156 seats available for the press. Thus in all the stadium holds 30,000 people.

{"id": "3419284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3419284", "title": "Schollmaier Arena", "text": "Schollmaier Arena\n\nEd & Rae Schollmaier Arena, formerly known as Daniel–Meyer Coliseum, is a basketball arena located on the campus of Texas Christian University (TCU) in Fort Worth, Texas, United States. The arena is part of the Daniel-Meyer Athletics Complex and sits between Amon G. Carter Stadium and Sam Baugh Indoor Practice Facility. The arena is home to the TCU Horned Frogs Men's and Women's basketball teams. It was built in 1961 and originally named after former TCU football and basketball coach Dutch Meyer and former TCU board member Milton Daniel. As part of the 2015 renovation, the facility was renamed for lead donors Ed & Rae Schollmaier. The facility currently seats 6,700 people.\n\nPrior to the TCU vs. KU men’s basketball game on February 6, 2013 the TCU men’s basketball team was 9-12 (0-8 Big 12) with their last win being Sunday, December 30 against Mississippi Valley State. University of Kansas was 19-2 prior to playing TCU, coming off a loss at home, in Lawrence, Kansas, against the Oklahoma State Cowboys.\n\nThe TCU men's basketball team took out the Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team, ranked #5 at the time, in the Daniel–Meyer Coliseum on February 6, 2013. The game was scheduled to tip off at 8:00 pm CT and air on ESPNU. It took the Jayhawks over seven minutes from the start of the game to make a field goal. The score going into halftime was 22-13 in TCU’s favor. Kansas head coach Bill Self sounded furious with the play of his Kansas Basketball team, as he said in a post game interview, “It was the worst team that Kansas ever put on the floor, since Dr. Naismith was there.” \n\nSenior guard Garlon Green, whose brother is Gerald Green, scored a team high with 20 points on his 100th consecutive game for the Horned Frogs. The final score was 62-55 in TCU’s favor, and as soon as time expired, TCU students and fans rushed the court to celebrate their first Big 12 victory. The highest ranked squad TCU had beaten prior to the game was #6 Oklahoma on December 27, 1987.\n\nDaniel–Meyer Coliseum had a record crowd of 7,412 fans on February 6, which broke the previous record of 7,267 from December 1, 2003 against Kansas. In the 2014 game against Kansas, there were 7,494 fans in attendance, breaking the record set on February 6, 2013. TCU lost in the team’s second Big 12 game against the University of Kansas at the DMC 69-91. Andrew Wiggins scored a game high 27 against the Horned Frogs.\n\nThe TCU Lady Frogs faced the Oklahoma State women’s basketball team on February 20, 2013. TCU came into the game with a 7-17 record (0-13 in the Big 12). The game tipped off at 8:00 pm ET, with TCU still winless in Big 12 women’s basketball, but the TCU Lady Frogs scored 11 unanswered points to beat OSU 64-63 and win their first Big 12 game. Delisa Gross scored the game winner with 1:04 left to put the Frogs up by one. The Oklahoma State Cowgirls women’s basketball team was ranked #23 going into the game.\n\nTCU went on to beat the Iowa State Cyclones 61-58 in the Daniel–Meyer Coliseum on Saturday, March 2, 2013. The Cyclones were ranked #23 at the time of the game, with a record of 20-6 (11-5 in the Big 12). Zahna Medley scored 18 points for the Lady Frogs to help secure a win over Iowa State. Delisa Ross contributed 15 points of her own for the Lady Frogs on her final game in the DMC as a TCU Horned Frog. This was the second, and last, Big 12 win for the Lady Frogs of the 2012-13 basketball season.\n\nThe DMC has a four-panel LED scoreboard, along with LED sideline boards. The cost of the new screens came to be $1.5 million. The screens are used during the games to show the live feed, highlights, and company promotions.\n\nOn April 16, 2013, the university announced plans for a $45 million renovation to the arena. The project transformed the 53-year-old facility into a modern arena, with widened concourses, additional bathrooms and upgraded concessions. The proposed facade remade the outdated exterior of the venue into something resembling the brick and art deco architecture of the neighboring Amon G. Carter Stadium. The court was lowered several feet to accommodate additional rows of seating that would fill in the large curves currently on either side of the court, giving fans courtside seating and much closer views of the action. Among the many additions and upgrades were a courtside club on the floor level for season ticket holders and new offices for TCU athletic staff coaches of sports such as soccer, tennis and golf. New locker rooms for both TCU and visiting teams and team meeting rooms were added. TCU was forced to play at another area arena during the 2014-15 season.\n\nThe project was formally approved by the university on November 7, 2013, with construction beginning in March 2014. There are fences around the arena with outdoor print of the future design of the Daniel–Meyer Coliseum. The new arena's renovation is scheduled for completion in October 2015. During the renovations, the university agreed to play games at Wilkerson-Greines Activity Center, a 4,759-seat arena adjacent to Tarrant County College and owned by the Fort Worth Independent School District and located approximately 15 minutes southeast of campus.\n\nOn July 30, 2015, TCU revised the total cost of the renovations to over $80 million, and announced the facility would be renamed as Ed & Rae Schollmaier Arena for the project's lead donors. The renovated facility was re-opened on December 20, 2015 when the men's basketball team played Abilene Christian.\n\n\n"}

The track was the first to be floodlit in Britain and often holds meetings in the evening.\n\nThe course has a Tapeta surface, and is one mile (1,609 m) in circumference, with left-hand turns — giving it greater commonality with most racetracks found in the United States than with other venues in the UK.\n\nThere has been a racecourse in Wolverhampton since 1825, in what is now the West Park, where the Park Road follows the line of the track. This was sold to the Corporation in 1878 and, after a gap of nine years, a new course was formed at Dunstall Park.\n\nIn December 1993 the course was re-vamped with floodlights and a new all-weather Fibresand track that ran alongside the turf track. A hotel, new grandstand, restaurant and executive boxes were also built at this time. In 1999 the course was bought from private ownership by Arena Leisure. In 2004 the Fibresand and turf tracks were replaced with a single Polytrack surface, as well as refurbishment of the hotel and conference facilities. Since that time the course has only held flat all weather races. In 2014, citing dissatisfaction with the degradation of the Polytrack surface, the course was closed for several months while a new artificial surface, Tapeta, was laid down. The course reopened on 11 August 2014.\n\nThe course has been granted planning permission by Wolverhampton City Council, to expand the hotel from 54 to 170 bedrooms and to tarmac the over-spill car park. The £26 million project also includes plans for a casino which would create the first racino in the UK.\n\n\n"}
