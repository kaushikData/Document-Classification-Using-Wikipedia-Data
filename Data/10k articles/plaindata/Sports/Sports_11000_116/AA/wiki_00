The match took place from 29 January to 2 February 1988 and was drawn. It did not count as part of The Ashes series, in the same way as the Centenary Tests in 1977 and 1980 also were excluded from the Ashes lists.\n\nThe match was played in the middle of an England tour to New Zealand, where the team later played three Test matches, all of them also drawn. Previously the same winter, the England team had toured Pakistan, and Australia had hosted Tests and One Day Internationals against New Zealand and Sri Lanka (the single Test against Sri Lanka came after the Bicentennial Test, but all other matches were before it).\n\nSydney's reputation for favouring spin bowling led both sides to pick two specialist spin bowlers and to favour medium-pace or fast-medium bowling over out-and-out speed.\n\nEngland were captained by Mike Gatting, fresh from his finger-wagging confrontation with umpire Shakoor Rana, and lacked several of the big name players of recent years, such as Graham Gooch, David Gower, Allan Lamb, and Ian Botham.\n\nThe team was, in batting order: \n\nAustralia were captained by Allan Border. The team, in batting order, was:\n\nEngland won the toss and batted. Broad shared stands of 93 with Moxon, who made 40, and 99 with Robinson, who made 43, on his way to a century on the first day. Wickets fell more steadily across the second day, including Broad for 139. Broad reacted angrily to his dismissal, and flattened the leg stump with his bat as he departed: he was fined the maximum permitted (£500) by the tour manager. England's final total of 425 contained no other scores of more than 50: the next highest after Broad was French with 47.\n\nOn the third day, Australia batted poorly and lost wickets regularly to shots more suited to one-day cricket. Jones made 56, but when bad light ended play two hours early, the side was 164 for seven wickets, 62 runs short of the follow-on. In tense cricket on the fourth morning, they failed to reach that figure by 12 runs, and Gatting enforced the follow-on. With the pitch getting slower and easier, Marsh and Boon put up a first-wicket partnership of 162 and after Marsh went for 56, Boon batted on and on across the final day, eventually reaching 184 not out, his then-highest Test score, as Australia got to 328 for two to save the match. They were helped by the loss of more play to bad light (when Gatting recalled fast bowler Dilley to the attack), injuries to both Dilley and Foster and lack of penetration among the other England bowlers. \n\nThe match was watched by 103,831 people, well below the forecast figure.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3402793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3402793", "title": "Blue (university sport)", "text": "Blue (university sport)\n\nA blue is an award earned by athletes at a university and some schools for competition at the highest level. The awarding of blues began at Oxford and Cambridge universities in England. It is awarded at British, and some Canadian, Australian and New Zealand universities.\n\nThe first sporting contest between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge was held on 4 June 1827, when a two-day cricket match at Lord's, organized by Charles Wordsworth, nephew of the poet William, resulted in a draw. There is no record of any university \"colours\" being worn during the game.\n\nAt the first Boat Race in 1829, the Oxford crew was dominated by students of Christ Church, whose college colours were dark blue. They wore white shirts with dark blue stripes, while Cambridge wore white with a pink or scarlet sash. At the second race, in 1836, a light blue ribbon was attached to the front of the Cambridge boat, probably as it was the colour of Eton. These colours — light blue for Cambridge, and dark blue for Oxford — became the official colours of the two boat clubs, and through the rivalry of the Boat Race, the colours became inextricably linked with the universities and contests between the two.\n\nAthletes at the University of Cambridge may be awarded a full blue (or simply a blue), half blue, first team colours or second team colours for competing at the highest level of university sport, which must include being in a varsity match or race against the University of Oxford. A full blue is the highest honour that may be bestowed on a Cambridge athlete, and is a much-coveted and prestigious prize. In general, the full blue standard is approximately that of being successful at a national level of student competition, and the half blue standard is that of being successful at county or regional level.\n\nOnce light blue had been chosen as the colour of Cambridge's Boat Club, the other university sport clubs followed suit, though out of courtesy would request permission from the Boat Club before awarding such a \"blue\". In the 1860s the three senior sports — rowing, cricket and athletics — were awarding blues, and the presidents of each formed an informal \"Blues Committee\" to oversee such awards. By 1880 a number of smaller clubs involved in varsity matches had successfully requested the right to award \"half blues\".\n\nThe criteria for awarding blues are different for men and women. Awards are made at the discretion of the men's and women's Blues Committees. The Men's Blues Committee is formed from one representative of each of the full blue sports, and the Women's from one representative of each of the full blue and half blue sports. Each committee meets to discuss issues relating to Cambridge sport.\n\nIn some sports with full blue status, the varsity match second team is awarded second team colours.\n\nThe awarding of a full blue often requires a person to fulfill a number of requirements in the same academic year, particularly in sports with discretionary full blue status. If, for whatever reason, an exceptional athlete is of or above full blue standard but does not fulfill all the requirements for the 'automatic' award of a full blue in any given year, the committee has the authority to grant an extraordinary full blue to that person subject to scrutiny of the particular case. The individual's case must be presented to the Blues Committee in person and must be backed up by substantial evidence and references. The award is unlikely to be made unless the person is of world-class or at least international standard.\n\nEach sport has specific criteria for each award; the general categorisation of men's and women's sports is laid out below, though the status of each sport is subject to frequent review.\n\nThe winner of a blue or half blue is entitled to wear a blues blazer, which is one of the most recognisable and distinctive garments associated with Cambridge University. Full blue blazers are completely coloured Cambridge Blue. Half blue blazers have a number of different designs, depending on the wearer's sport; a typical design is an off-white blazer with Cambridge blue lapels and trimmings. There is a variety of other blue and half blue paraphernalia, including scarves, ties, pullovers, bow ties, caps and squares. Such items are worn with pride.\n\n, the colour recognised officially by the University as Cambridge Blue actually has a slight green tint.\n\nIn 2008 in Cambridge an alumna launched Oxbridge Blues Jewellery specifically for women's blues and half blues at the two Universities. These are the only blues item to have been licensed by the University of Cambridge.\n\nMen holding blues, half blues or second team colours in a Full blue sport are eligible to join the Hawks' Club. Women holding any of these awards are eligible to join The Ospreys, which was founded in 1985.\n\nAt the University of Oxford, the committees for awarding blues and half blues work on much the same principles as the Cambridge committees. The principal difference between the two men's committees is that, at Oxford, all Captains, regardless of their status as full, discretionary, or half blue must attend meetings of the Committee. Until recently, the voting was broken up according to blues status with full blue captains being allowed to vote on all matters while all the other captains could only vote on matters directly relating to half blue sports. In Michaelmas Term 2006, the committee finally allowed discretionary full blue captains the right to vote on matters directly relating to discretionary full blue sports. This has ended many years of inequality for discretionary full blue status captains and was largely welcomed by the committee.\n\nThe committees are administered by an elected president, secretary and treasurer who serve one year. Unlike at Cambridge, where the president of Cambridge University Boat Club holds the position, at Oxford, any captain can be elected president, regardless of sport or status.\n\nThe role of the president is to call and serve as chair of any meeting of the committee, of which there are normally 3 per year (6 for the women). They also serve as the representative of the committee and sit on the University Sports Strategy Committee and the Executive Committee of the Sports Federation. Both Presidents along with the Director of Sport represent Oxford at any meetings of a Joint Blues Committee held with Cambridge. The purpose of the Joint Blues Committee is to discuss issues of eligibility for the varsity match and to settle any disputes between the sporting communities of the two universities.\n\nThe colour of an Oxford full blue blazer is dark blue. The Oxford half blue blazer can be one of two designs. Either it is composed of thick vertical stripes of dark blue and off-white, as in the adjacent image, or it can be dark blue, as the full blue blazer, with two white stripes above the club badge on the left breast.\n\nThe Oxford range of Oxbridge Blues Jewellery was launched in Oxford at the Women's Blues Award Ceremony in the Natural History Museum in 2012. The range is the same as the Cambridge design except that the semi-precious stones are navy blue and white.\n\nThe club associated with the Oxford blue is Vincent’s Club, although its membership is not restricted to blues, and there are wider criteria for election. \"Atalantas\" is a club for sportswomen at Oxford, and also is not restricted to blues.\n\nThe Adelaide University Sports Association at the University of Adelaide in Adelaide, South Australia awards a blue and a half blue for outstanding sporting achievement, and a club letters for both sporting achievement and service.\n\nLa Trobe University has awarded blues and half blues since its early years, with the first blues being awarded in 1968. The annual Blues and Sports Awards Night recognises the elite sports men and women who have represented La Trobe via the university's clubs, intervarsity sporting competitions and the World University games. There are also awards for Outstanding Service which recognise the outstanding service to sports clubs by members of the La Trobe Community.\n\nThe Melbourne University Sports Association (originally known as the 'Sports Union') awards blues and half blues at the University of Melbourne, for outstanding performance in inter-university events (primarily through the Australian University Games and Australian University Championships). A 'distinguished service award' may be made (including to non-students) for outstanding service to a sporting club (or clubs), the Sports Association, and/or sport at the university generally.\n\nBlues were first awarded in 1904, as one of the first items of business of the newly formed Sports Union, with retrospective awards made back as early as 1870. Initially, awards were made automatically to all participants in an intervarsity contest, with the level (full or half blue) dependant on the sport. In 1911, this model was replaced with the formation of a 'Blues Advisory Board' to determine the awards based on an individual's performance. The BAB continues to serve this role today.\n\nBlues and half-blues have been awarded at the University of Queensland since 1912. Blues have been awarded for outstanding performances in club fixtures, representative games, and inter-university competitions as well as for international representation whilst studying at the University. The University of Queensland blue is the highest sporting accolade an athlete can receive from the university. In recent years, UQ Sport through its Blues Advisory Committee, has developed a selection method and criteria to ensure that blues and half blues at the university are of the highest standard. Each year these awards are presented at the UQ Sport Blues Awards Dinner.\n\nSince 1919 the New Zealand Universities Blue has been awarded to NZ University students who have achieved excellence both on and off the field of play. Currently University Sport New Zealand is responsible for presenting this award\n\nIn addition, individual universities will award their own blues. For example, University of Otago blues date from 1907, therefore pre-dating the New Zealand Universities blue.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Shoemaker Center, which was also the name of the arena until 2005, when it was named for Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank)\n\nThe facility hosted the 1994 Great Midwest Conference men's and women's basketball tournaments, the 1998 Conference USA men's basketball & volleyball tournaments, the 1999 NCAA Mideast Women's Basketball Regional, the 2003 NCAA West Women's Basketball Subregional, and the 2006 Big East volleyball championship.\n\nAs of March 2, 2017, the Bearcats are 392–77 (.836) all-time at Fifth Third Arena, including a 42-game win streak from 1997 to 2000. In the 1999–2000 season, every Bearcat home game was sold out. During the Bob Huggins era, it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation due to the high decibel levels typical of his tenure.\n\nA new basketball court was installed prior to the 2003–2004 season. It is a similar floor to ones used in the NBA. Like its predecessor, it is named Ed Jucker court, in honor of the coach who led the Bearcats to their two national championships.\n\nThe building housing the arena is named for Myrl H. Shoemaker, the former lieutenant governor of the state of Ohio. Prior to the building of The Shoe, the Bearcats played off-campus at Riverfront Coliseum (now U.S. Bank Arena) and the Cincinnati Gardens. Their previous on-campus arena, Armory Fieldhouse, has been renovated for recreational use, and is located adjacent to the arena to the north.\n\nOn October 31, 2014 WLWT reported that the arena, could be in line for a $70 million facelift. The project would reduce the amount of seating, but improve visibility in the arena. It would also upgrade club areas, restrooms, and even add a new roof.\n\nOn June 23, 2015, WXIX-TV reported the price rose to $80 million. The new capacity would be 10,818. Per the Fifth Third Arena RFQ (Ohio Facilities Construction Commission) Construction was scheduled to start in March 2016 with completion by September 2017. The Bearcats would play games off campus during the 2016–17 season during renovations.\n\nOn August 25, 2015, The university officially kicked off the multimillion-dollar fundraising campaign for the renovation. The UC Board of Trustees approved an interim $2.2-million funding request to allow for completion of documents in the design development phase. $15 million has been raised toward the project, an additional $25 million must be raised before the board gives full approval in December. UC teams under the renovation plan would vacate Fifth Third Arena for the 2016–17 season. UC Athletic Director Mike Bohn said that U.S. Bank Arena, Cincinnati Gardens, Cintas Center or BB&T Arena are possibilities as a temporary home. No timetable was provided on when a decision would be made on where events will be held.\nOn June 16, 2016, the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority approved a contract to acquire the Cincinnati Gardens for $1.75 million. The arena will be demolished and the 19-acre site will be repurposed for future light manufacturing. The sale and imminent demolition of the Cincinnati Gardens eliminated the possibility of the facility being used as a temporary home arena during the renovations of Fifth Third Arena\n\nOn December 15, 2015, the UC Board of Trustees approved an $87-million, privately funded renovation of Fifth Third Arena. Proposed improvements to the facility, include the creation of a 360-degree seating bowl, new HD scoreboard, ribbon boards, sound system, an LED lighting system which will allow for enhanced gameday presentation, new restroom and concession facilities, a new upper-level concourse with its own fan amenities, expanded food and beverage options and a new main entrance and plaza with centralized ticketing and guest services. The renovated arena also would feature upgraded locker room spaces, expanded premium seating options, including a courtside club, arena club and concourse club as well as enclosed suites, loge seating, a new Bearcats Lounge and super suites. During the meeting, trustee Rob Richardson Jr. said the upgraded facility would support the university's objective to join a power athletic conference and in student-athlete recruitment. Construction was set to begin in April 2017 and be completed in fall 2018. Construction was originally scheduled to start in March 2016 with completion by September 2017, but the timeframe was pushed as a result of the project's complexity and pace of fundraising. Lesson's learned from the renovation of nearby Nippert Stadium drove a desire not to rush the renovation of 5/3rd Arena, given the uniquely tight quarters of UC's campus. \n\nA first phase of the renovation was completed prior to the start of the 2016-2017 season, adding four 18-seat luxury suites on the sixth floor of the arena behind the north baseline of the court, which formerly housed the UCATS Club. Each suite features granite countertops, a flat-screen television, along with custom cabinets and furniture. These suites were used during the 2016-2017 season. Men's and women's basketball and volleyball home events would be conducted off campus during the 2017–18 season while the rest of the renovation was performed. Major renovation work began after the 2016–17 season and is set to be completed by November 2018. On February 10, 2017, the university announced that home men's basketball games would be moved to BB&T Arena on the campus of Northern Kentucky University in Highland Heights, Kentucky during the renovations of Fifth Third Arena. In April 2017, the university announced that the women's basketball and volleyball teams will play their home games in the St. Ursula Academy Gymnasium & Convocation Center near campus.\n\nOn October 2nd, 2018, UC announced the array of new concession options for the renovated Fifth Third Arena. This selection included local staple eateries such as Skyline Chili, Taste of Belgium, and Frisch's Big Boy as well as local craft brewery selections at their new in arena bars including Rhinegeist and Madtree Brewing. \n\nOn October 24th, 2018, ahead of the home opener for the renovated Fifth Third Arena, the University of Cincinnati announced record breaking season ticket sales for the upcoming 2018-2019 season, surpassing the previous record set in the Bob Huggins era with a new benchmark of just under 9000 season tickets sold.\n\nThrough the 2016–17 season, the Bearcats men's basketball team has a record of 392 wins and 77 losses in the arena, a winning percentage of 83.6%. They have finished undefeated in home games on four occasions. \nOVERALL: 392–77 () \n\n\n"}
{"id": "37688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37688", "title": "Gaelic football", "text": "Gaelic football\n\nGaelic football (Irish: \"Peil Ghaelach\"; short name \"Peil\" or \"Caid\"), commonly referred to as football or Gaelic, is an Irish team sport. It is played between two teams of 15 players on a rectangular grass pitch. The objective of the sport is to score by kicking or punching the ball into the other team's goals (3 points) or between two upright posts above the goals and over a crossbar above the ground (1 point).\n\nPlayers advance the football, a spherical leather ball, up the field with a combination of carrying, bouncing, kicking, hand-passing, and soloing (dropping the ball and then toe-kicking the ball upward into the hands). In the game, two types of scores are possible: points and goals. A point is awarded for kicking or hand-passing the ball over the crossbar, signalled by the umpire raising a white flag. A goal is awarded for kicking the ball under the crossbar into the net, signalled by the umpire raising a green flag. Positions in Gaelic football are similar to that in other football codes, and comprise one goalkeeper, six backs, two midfielders, and six forwards, with a variable number of substitutes.\n\nGaelic football is one of four sports (collectively referred to as the \"Gaelic games\") controlled by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), the largest sporting organisation in Ireland. Along with hurling and camogie, Gaelic football is one of the few remaining strictly amateur sports in the world, with players, coaches, and managers prohibited from receiving any form of payment. Gaelic football is mainly played on the island of Ireland, although units of the Association exist in other areas such as Great Britain, North America and Australia.\n\nThe final of the All-Ireland Senior Championship, held annually at Croke Park, Dublin, draws crowds of more than 80,000 people. Outside Ireland, football is mainly played among members of the Irish diaspora. Gaelic Park in New York City is the largest purpose-built Gaelic sports venue outside Ireland. Three major football competitions operate throughout the year: the National Football League and the All-Ireland Senior Championship operate on an inter-county basis, while the All-Ireland Club Championship is contested by individual clubs. The All-Ireland Senior Championship is considered the most prestigious event in Gaelic football.\n\nUnder the auspices of the GAA, Gaelic football is a male-only sport; however, the related sport of ladies' Gaelic football is governed by the Ladies' Gaelic Football Association. Similarities between Gaelic football and Australian rules football have allowed the development of international rules football, a hybrid sport, and a series of Test matches has been held regularly since 1998.\n\nWhile Gaelic football as it is known today dates back to the late 19th century, various kinds of football were played in Ireland before this time. The first legal reference to football in Ireland was in 1308, when John McCrocan, a spectator at a football game at \"Novum Castrum de Leuan\" (the New Castle of the Lyons or Newcastle) was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard. A field near Newcastle, South Dublin is still known as the football field. The Statute of Galway of 1527 allowed the playing of \"foot balle\" and archery but banned \"hokie'—the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves\" as well as other sports.\n\nBy the 17th century, the situation had changed considerably. The games had grown in popularity and were widely played. This was due to the patronage of the gentry. Now instead of opposing the games it was the gentry and the ruling class who were serving as patrons of the games. Games were organised between landlords with each team comprising 20 or more tenants. Wagers were commonplace with purses of up to 100 guineas (Prior, 1997).\n\nThe earliest record of a recognised precursor to the modern game date from a match in County Meath in 1670, in which catching and kicking the ball was permitted.\n\nHowever even \"foot-ball\" was banned by the severe Sunday Observance Act of 1695, which imposed a fine of one shilling (a substantial amount at the time) for those caught playing sports. It proved difficult, if not impossible, for the authorities to enforce the Act and the earliest recorded inter-county match in Ireland was one between Louth and Meath, at Slane, in 1712, about which the poet James Dall McCuairt wrote a poem of 88 verses beginning \"Ba haigeanta\".\n\nA six-a-side version was played in Dublin in the early 18th century, and 100 years later there were accounts of games played between County sides (Prior, 1997).\n\nBy the early 19th century, various football games, referred to collectively as \"caid\", were popular in Kerry, especially the Dingle Peninsula. Father W. Ferris described two forms of \"caid\": the \"field game\" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees, and; the epic \"cross-country game\", which lasted the whole of a Sunday (after mass) and was won by taking the ball across a parish boundary. \"Wrestling\", \"holding\" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.\n\nDuring the 1860s and 1870s, rugby football started to become popular in Ireland. Trinity College, Dublin was an early stronghold of rugby, and the rules of the (English) Football Association were codified in 1863 and distributed widely. By this time, according to Gaelic football historian Jack Mahon, even in the Irish countryside, \"caid\" had begun to give way to a \"rough-and-tumble game\", which even allowed tripping. Association football started to take hold, especially in Ulster, in the 1880s.\n\nLimerick was the stronghold of the native game around this time, and the Commercials Club, founded by employees of Cannock's Drapery Store, was one of the first to impose a set of rules, which was adapted by other clubs in the city. Of all the Irish pastimes the GAA set out to preserve and promote, it is fair to say that Gaelic football was in the worst shape at the time of the association's foundation (GAA Museum, 2001).\n\nIrish forms of football were not formally arranged into an organised playing code by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) until 1887. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject \"foreign\" (particularly English) imports. The first Gaelic football rules, showing the influence of hurling and a desire to differentiate from association football—for example in their lack of an offside rule—were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the \"United Ireland\" magazine on 7 February 1887. The rules of the aforementioned Commercials Club became the basis for these official (Gaelic Football) rules who, unsurprisingly, won the inaugural All-Ireland Senior Football Final (representing County Limerick). The very first game of Gaelic Football under GAA rules (developed by Maurice Davin) was played near Callan, Co Kilkenny in February 1885.\n\nOn Bloody Sunday in 1920, during the Anglo-Irish War, a football match at Croke Park was attacked by British forces. 14 people were killed and 65 were injured. Among the dead was Tipperary footballer Michael Hogan, for whom the Hogan Stand at Croke Park (completed in 1924) was named.\n\nBy 1958, Wembley Stadium hosted annual exhibition games of Gaelic football in England, before tens of thousands of spectators.\n\nLadies' Gaelic football has become increasingly popular with women since the 1970s.\n\nThe relationship between Gaelic football and Australian rules football and the question of whether they have shared origins has been debated. What is known is that in 1967, Australian journalist, broadcaster and VFL umpire Harry Beitzel, inspired by watching the 1966 All-Ireland senior football final on television, sent an Australian team known as the \"Galahs\" to play an Irish team, which was the first recorded major interaction between the two codes. \n\nWhat then followed is the current International Rules Series between players of both codes and utilizing rules from both codes, which also gives them a chance to represent their country. The GAA chooses the team to represent Ireland, while the AFL chooses the team to represent Australia. The two countries take turns hosting the series, and both countries' and sports' respective most prestigious venues – Croke Park and the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) – have hosted series Tests. What is known as the Irish experiment also occurred, with Australian rules football clubs recruiting Gaelic football players. Irishmen who have distinguished themselves in both codes include Dublin's Jim Stynes – a 1984 minor All-Ireland football champion who became the 1991 Brownlow Medallist, a recipient of the Medal of the Order of Australia and a member of Melbourne's Team of the Century – and Kerry's Tadhg Kennelly, the first man to become both a senior All-Ireland football champion (2009) and an AFL Premiership player (2005 with Sydney, the Swans' first flag in 72 years).\n\nA Gaelic pitch is similar in some respects to a rugby pitch but larger. The grass pitch is rectangular, stretching long and wide. There are H-shaped goalposts at each end, formed by two posts, which are usually high, set apart, and connected above the ground by a crossbar. A net extending behind the goal is attached to the crossbar and lower goal posts. The same pitch is used for hurling; the GAA, which organises both sports, decided this to facilitate dual usage. Lines are marked at distances of 13 metres, 20 metres, and 45 metres (65 m in hurling) from each end-line. Shorter pitches and smaller goals are used by youth teams.\n\nThe majority of adult football and all minor and under-21 matches last for 60 minutes, divided into two halves of 30 minutes, with the exception of senior inter-county games, which last for 70 minutes (two halves of 35 minutes). Draws are decided by replays or by playing 20 minutes of extra time (two halves of 10 minutes). Juniors have a half of 20 minutes or 25 minutes in some cases. Half-time lasts for about 5 or 10 minutes.\n\nTeams consist of fifteen players (a goalkeeper, two corner backs, a full back, two wing backs, a centre back, two mid fielders, two wing forwards, a centre forward, two corner forwards and a full forward) plus up to fifteen substitutes, of which six may be used. As for younger teams or teams that do not have enough players for fifteen aside, it is not uncommon to play thirteen aside (the same positions except without the full back and the full forward). Each player is numbered 1–15, starting with the goalkeeper, who must wear a jersey colour different from that of his or her teammates. Up to 15 substitutes may be named on the team sheet, number 16 usually being the reserve goalkeeper.\n\nThe game is played with a round leather football made of 18 stitched leather panels, similar in appearance to a traditional volleyball (but larger), with a circumference of , weighing between when dry. It may be kicked or \"hand passed\". A hand pass is not a punch but rather a strike of the ball with the side of the closed fist, using the knuckle of the thumb.\n\nIn 2017, the GAA introduced the 'mark' across the board in Gaelic football. Similar to the mark in Australian rules football, a player who catches the ball from a kick-out is awarded a free kick. The rule in full states: \"When a player catches the ball cleanly from a Kick-Out without it touching the ground, on or past the 45 m line nearest the Kick Out point, he shall be awarded 'a Mark' by the Referee. The player awarded a 'Mark' shall have the options of (a) Taking a free kick or (b) Playing on immediately.\" In comparison, the Australian rules equivalent requires the ball not to have touched the ground and for the kick to have travelled at least 15 metres.\n\nThere are three main types of fouls in Gaelic Football, which can result in the ball being given to the other team, a player being cautioned, a player being removed from the field, or even the game being terminated.\n\nThe following are considered technical fouls (\"fouling the ball\"):\n\nAggressive fouls are physical or verbal fouls committed by a player against an opponent or the referee. The player can be cautioned (shown a yellow card), ordered off the pitch without a substitute (red card), or (beginning 1 January 2014) ordered off the pitch with a substitution (black card).\n\nA dissent foul is a foul where a player fails to comply with the officials' judgment and/or instructions. The player can be cautioned (shown a yellow card), ordered off the pitch without a substitute (red card), the free kick placement moved 13 m further down-field, or in certain circumstances, the game can be terminated. The following are considered dissent fouls:\n\nIf the ball goes over the crossbar, a \"point\" is scored and a white flag is raised by an umpire. A point is scored by either kicking the ball over the crossbar, or fisting it over, in which case the hand must be closed while striking the ball. If the ball goes below the crossbar, a \"goal\", worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised by an umpire. A goal is scored by kicking the ball into the net, not by fist passing the ball into it. However, a player can strike the ball into the net with a closed fist if the ball was played to him by another player or came in contact with the post/crossbar/ground prior to connection. The goal is guarded by a goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format Goal Total-Point Total. To determine the score-line goals must be converted to points and added to the other points. For example, in a match with a final score of Team A 0–21 Team B 4–8, Team A is the winner with 21 points, as Team B scored only 20 points (4 times 3, plus 8).\n\nThe level of tackling allowed is less robust than in rugby.\n\nShoulder to shoulder contact and slapping the ball out of an opponent's hand are permitted, but the following are all fouls:\n\n\nA football match is overseen by up to eight officials:\n\n\nThe referee is responsible for starting and stopping play, recording the score, awarding frees and booking and sending off players.\n\nLinesmen are responsible for indicating the direction of line balls to the referee.\n\nThe fourth official is responsible for overseeing substitutions, and also indicating the amount of stoppage time (signalled to him by the referee) and the players substituted using an electronic board.\n\nThe umpires are responsible for judging the scoring. They indicate to the referee whether a shot was: wide (spread both arms), a 45 m kick (raise one arm), a point (wave white flag), square ball (cross arms) or a goal (wave green flag). A disallowed score is indicated by crossing the green and white flags.\n\nOther officials are not obliged to indicate any misdemeanours to the referee; they are only permitted to inform the referee of violent conduct they have witnessed that has occurred without the referee's knowledge. A linesman/umpire is not permitted to inform the referee of technical fouls such as a \"double bounce\" or an illegal pick-up of the ball. Such decisions can only be made at the discretion of the referee.\n\nThe Team of the Century was nominated in 1984 by \"Sunday Independent\" readers and selected by a panel of experts including journalists and former players. It was not chosen as part of the Gaelic Athletic Association's centenary year celebrations. The goal was to single out the best ever 15 players who had played the game in their respective positions. Naturally many of the selections were hotly debated by fans around the country.\n\nThe Team of the Millennium was a team chosen in 1999 by a panel of GAA past presidents and journalists. The goal was to single out the best ever 15 players who had played the game in their respective positions, since the foundation of the GAA in 1884 up to the Millennium year, 2000. Naturally many of the selections were hotly debated by fans around the country.\n\nGaelic sports at all levels are amateur, in the sense that the athletes even those playing at elite level do not receive payment for their performance\n\nThe main competitions at all levels of Gaelic football are the League and the Championship. Of these it is the Championship (a knock-out tournament) that tends to attain the most prestige.\n\nThe basic unit of each game is organised at the club level, which is usually arranged on a parochial basis. Local clubs compete against other clubs in their county with the intention of winning the County Club Championship at senior, junior or intermediate levels (for adults) or under-21, minor or under-age levels (for children). A club may field more than one team, for example a club may field a team at senior level and a \"seconds\" team at junior or intermediate level. This format is laid out in the table below:\n\nClubs may come together in districts for the County Championship or compete on their own.\n\nThough the island of Ireland was partitioned between two states by the British parliament in 1920, the organisation of Gaelic games (like that of most cultural organisations and religions) continues on an All-Ireland basis. At the national level, Ireland's Gaelic games are organised in 32 GAA counties, most of which are identical in name and extent to the 32 administrative counties on which local government throughout the island was based until the late 20th century. The term \"county\" is also used for some overseas GAA places, such as London and New York. Clubs are also located throughout the world, in other parts of the United States, in Britain, in Canada, in Asia, in Australasia and in continental Europe.\n\nThe level at which county teams compete against each other is referred to as inter-county (i.e. similar to international). A county panel—a team of 15 players, plus a similar number of substitutes—is formed from the best players playing at club level in each county. The most prestigious inter-county competition in Gaelic football is the All-Ireland Championship. The highest level national championship is called the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Nearly all counties contest this tournament on an annual basis, with crowds of people thronging venues the length and breadth of Ireland—the most famous of these stadiums being Croke Park—to support their local county team, a team comprising players selected from the clubs in that county. These modified knock-out games start as provincial championships contested by counties against other counties in their respective province, the four Irish provinces of Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht. The four victors in these then progress automatically to the All-Ireland series.\n\nIn the past, the team winning each provincial championship would play one of the others, at a stage known as the All-Ireland semi-finals, with the winning team from each game playing each other in the famed All-Ireland Final to determine the outright winner. A recent (1990s/2000s) re-organisation created a \"back door\" method of qualifying, with teams knocked out during the provincial rounds of the All-Ireland Championship now acquiring a second chance at glory. Now the four victorious teams at provincial level enter the recently created All-Ireland quarter-finals instead, where they compete against the four remaining teams from the All-Ireland Qualifiers to progress to the All-Ireland semi-finals and then the All-Ireland Final. This re-organisation means that one team may defeat another team in an early stage of the championship, yet be defeated and knocked out of the tournament by the same team at a later stage. It also means a team may be defeated in an early stage of the championship, yet be crowned All-Ireland champions—as Tyrone were in 2005 and 2008.\n\nThe secondary competition at inter-county level is the National League. The National Football League is held every spring and groups counties in four divisions according to their relative strength. As at local (county) levels of Gaelic football, the League at national level is less prestigious than the Championship—however, in recent years attendances have grown, as has interest from the public and from players. This is due in part to the 2002 adoption of a February–April timetable, in place of the former November start, as well as the provision of Division 2 final stages. Live matches are aired on the international channel Setanta Sports and the Irish language channel TG4, with highlights shown on RTÉ Two.\n\nThere are also All-Ireland championships for county teams at Junior, Under-21 and Minor levels, and provincial and national club championships, contested by the teams that win their respective county championships.\n\n\n\n"}

Both in business and as a chess player he was eminently successful. In his early years he moved to Vienna, then spent a year in Italy. In 1859 he arrived in Paris and in 1860-62 mostly sojourned in London. In summer 1862 he accompanied the Russian Count Kushelev-Bezborodko to St. Petersburg, where he won a match against Shumov. Later he moved to Paris and in 1869 to Vienna. He became involved in banking and became a millionaire and chess patron, organizing and sponsoring important chess tournaments in the 1870s and 1880s. He founded the \"Wiener Börse-Syndikatskasse\" in 1869, and in 1873 established a commission house in Paris; and by prudent management he acquired considerable wealth. In 1881 he received the title of baron from Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen.\n\nAs a chess player, Kolisch soon became known for his brilliant and aggressive style, but he was not a frequent participant in tournaments. In 1860 he won the first prize at the international tournament held at Cambridge, England. In 1861 he lost a match to Adolf Anderssen, the strongest player of the day, by a score of 5–4.

{"id": "820948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=820948", "title": "La Bombonera", "text": "La Bombonera\n\nThe Estadio Alberto J. Armando (formerly the \"Estadio Camilo Cichero\") is an association football stadium located in La Boca district of Buenos Aires. Widely known as La Bombonera (; ) due to its shape, with a \"flat\" stand on one side of the pitch and three steep stands round the rest of the stadium. It has a capacity of 49,000.\n\nThe stadium is owned by Boca Juniors, one of Argentina's top football clubs. The unusual shape of the stadium has led to it having excellent acoustics and the Boca support being nicknamed \"La Doce (The 12th man\"). The pitch at La Bombonera is the minimum size required under FIFA regulations - 105m x 68m.\n\nThe stadium is widely regarded as one of the most emblematic stadiums of the world, and has been declared of public interest by the Government of Buenos Aires autonomous city.\n\nThe stadium, as well as being the home of Boca Juniors, who have over 16 million fans (the highest in Argentina), is also used as a concert venue. Past performers at \"La Bombonera\" have included Lenny Kravitz, Elton John, James Blunt, the Bee Gees, and the Backstreet Boys.\n\nPrevious to \"La Bombonera\", Boca Juniors had used several locations before settling on their current ground on Brandsen. Club's first ground had been located in \"Dársena Sur\" of the old Buenos Aires port (currently Puerto Madero) and \"Isla Demarchi\" before moving to Brandsen and Del Crucero (currently Del Valle Iberlucea) streets in 1924. The club built a stadium there. This would be used as home venue until the construction of \"La Bombonera\" on the same location.\n\nIn 1931, the Boca Juniors' steering committee (led by president Ruperto Molfino) acquired the lands to the Municipality of Buenos Aires for A$ 2,200,000. Three years later the club published a call for tenders to built its new stadium. The project was finally granted to the Delpini-Sulcic-Bes architectural office. which would be also design the Abasto Shopping in the 1990s.\n\nThe old stadium (still with wooden grandstands) was used for the last time on April 10, 1938, then being demolished to build the new stadium on the same location. While \"La Bombonera\" was under construction, Boca Juniors played their home games at Ferro Carril Oeste stadium.\n\nThe stadium finally opened on May 25, 1940, with a friendly match between Boca and San Lorenzo, which the home side won 2-0 with both goals scored by . Due to the fact that the stadium did not have a lighting system, the game only lasted 70' (two halves of 35' each).\n\nThe first official game at the new stadium was on June 2, 1940, when Boca Juniors beat Newell's Old Boys by 2–0. Ricardo Alarcón (who had scored in the opening game v. San Lorenzo) scored the first official goal in the new venue.\nAfter the stadium was inaugurated, the club continued to introduce refurbishments to expand its capacity. As a result, on November 16, 1941, a second tier was opened on the north side of the stadium, near Casa Amarilla train station. The grandstand was named \"Natalio Pescia\" in honour of one of the key players in Boca Juniors' history. In 1949 the club decided to add a third tier, adding also a lighting system. All of those works were completed in 1953; this third tier gave the stadium its enduring nickname: \"La Bombonera\". Boca Juniors celebrated with a friendly match v. Croatian club HNK Hajduk Split, which ended 1–1.\nThe stadium was named on April 20, 1986, by team President Antonio Alegre in honor of Camilo Cichero, a former team president under whose tenure work on \"La Bombonera\" began. It was renamed on December 27, 2000, by team President Mauricio Macri in honor of Alberto Armando, team president during its resurgence during the 1960s as well as a former business partner of his father Francisco Macri. The stadium was expanded and modernized during Macri's tenure, notably with the addition in 1996 of a fourth tier; and a wing housing a press area, VIP boxes, a museum, and offices. The stadium's exterior was later decorated with works by painters Rómulo Macció and Pérez Celis.\n\nSince then, \"La Bombonera\" was not remodeled until 1996 when the presidency of Mauricio Macri decided to expand its capacity to 57,500 spectators. Works included the demolition of the lateral boxes on Del Valle Iberlucea street, replacing them by a small stand and new and modern boxes (with metallic structure) placed over there. The \"new\" Bombonera was reinaugurated with a friendly match v. Club Universidad de Chile won by Boca Juniors by 3–1.\n\nAn electronic screen was installed in 2008, therefore Boca Juniors stadium became the third venue with this technology after Vélez Sársfield and River Plate. At the beginning of 2012, more than 500 seats were replaced and other 500 were added, apart of building four additional boxes.\n\nThe stadium is popularly known as \"La Bombonera\". It is said that the nickname came along the project of Viktor Sulčič during the process of development. On occasion of Sulčič's birthday, a friend gave him a box of chocolates as a gift. After that, Sulčič used to go with the box at meetings with engineer Delpine and other persons that collaborated with the project to show them that the box shape was very like the one of the stadium they were designing.\n\nSince then, the stadium would be known as \"La Bombonera\" (\"box of chocolates\" in Spanish) and that name has remained to present days. In fact, the opening day (May 25, 1940) the stadium was named that way even by the club executives.\n\nNevertheless, there are other stories or myths about the origin of the nickname. One of them tells that Delpini projected the stands with a highly vertical grade of inclination to host 100,000 persons (which was the first project). The shape of the stands looked like the carts used to collect horses dung in the streets of Buenos Aires. Other version credits journalist Hugo Marini or broadcaster Joaquín Carballo Serantes (aka) \"Fioravanti\" for the \"Bombonera\" nickname.\n\nDespite its distinguished nickname, the first official denomination came on April 20, 1986, when it was named \"Camilo Cichero\" in commemoration of the president under whose tenure the stadium was projected and built. That same day Boca Juniors defeated Talleres de Córdoba by 4–2. Nevertheless, president Mauricio Macri decided to change the stadium's name to \"Alberto J. Armando\", honoring long-time president of the club during two periods (1954–55, 1960–80).\n\nLa Bombonera currently has a capacity of around 48,000 and the club's popularity make tickets hard to find, especially for the Superclásico derby against River Plate.\n\nOut of its capacity of 49,000, there are 37,538 seats, 2780 are boxes and 8,682 standing. Both its interior and exterior are lined with a number of murals painted by the artist Pérez Celis depicting many of the club's legendary players and aspects of the district's culture, such as the life of Italian immigrants.\n\nIn 1996 a small stand was built on the 4th side, which had been largely open until then, except for some VIP boxes.\n\nDiego Maradona, who played for and supports Boca Juniors, has his own executive box at the stadium.\n\nThere are three parking lots at the stadium for members.\n\nThe national team has played several games in La Bombonera, including qualifying matches to the FIFA World Cup. The squad played the most games since the 1920s to the mid-1970s. Since the \"Estadio Monumental\" of River Plate was completely refurbished for the 1978 WC, the Argentine Football Association fixtured the majority of Argentina's home games at that venue. That decision was based on the \"Monumental\" higher capacity and modern facilities in comparison with La Bombonera.\n\nPlaying at Boca Juniors stadium, Argentina was only defeated in two games, having played a total of 27 matches, winning 18 and losing 2 with 7 ties. The squad scored 67 goals and only conceded 27. Some of the official and friendly games played by Argentina at the stadium (as of 29 May 2018) are listed below:\n\nThe Passion of Boca Juniors Museum () was opened in 2001 during the Mauricio Macri's administration. It is located within the stadium, just below the grandstands. The Museum was built on two floors and chronicles the club's rise from 1905 (the year the club was established) to the present day.\n\nOne of the exhibits in the museum is a giant football with 360-degree footage of the club's fans and players at a match. The museum also includes a Hall of fame and a large mural of Diego Maradona. Also included are non-football items such as the specially commissioned blue and gold guitar played by Lenny Kravitz when he performed at La Bombonera in 2005.\n\nA giant statue of Boca Juniors' all-time topscorer, Martín Palermo, was unveiled in 2011. Other former players who have their statues honoring them are Diego Maradona and Román Riquelme A total of seven Boca Juniors idols have been honored by the club with their respective monuments, they are Guillermo Barros Schelotto, Angel Clemente Rojas, Silvio Marzolini and Antonio Rattín, apart from Maradona, Palermo and Riquelme.\n\nCarlos Bianchi was the first Boca Juniors manager to be honored with a statue, when a monument of his figure was unveiled in October 2016. Bianchi won 9 titles during his two tenures on the club (1998–2003), becoming the most winning manager in Boca Juniors' history. Under Bianchi's coaching, the team also set a record of 40 matches unbeaten, the biggest since Argentine football became professional in 1931.\n\nThere are planned improvements for the stadium, including measures to ease crowd congestion, use of new technology in the stadium and improved corporate facilities. These include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30764153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30764153", "title": "Stance (American football)", "text": "Stance (American football)\n\nStance is the position an American football player adopts when a play begins. There are three common stances used by linemen: two-point, three-point, and four-point. The stance names reference the number of points where a player's body is touching the ground while down in the stance. Each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses; therefore, each one is used accordingly in different situations. Furthermore, stances are taught and used differently depending on the level of competition (little league football, high school football, college football, etc.).\n\nIn the National Football League (NFL), the average amount of plays per game is over 60 per team. This means that, in one game, a lineman playing the entire time could enter a stance more than 60 times. However, it is not likely to be the same stance every time. Furthermore, it is important to remember that the offensive team must remain still for one second prior to the ball being snapped. This means that once an offensive player has become set in a stance, he must stay in it until the ball is snapped and the play begins. Additional motion can result in a false start penalty. Defensive players, on the other hand, are permitted to shift as much as they want before a play. It is possible for a defensive lineman to line up in one stance and then change to another just before the play begins. He can even shift his body to another place.\n\nCommonly used stances are the two-point, three-point, and four-point.\n\nThe two-point variation is the most upright stance. Another name for the stance is the universal stance. The two-point is used by offensive linemen to facilitate better pass blocking because it increases their initial field of vision and gives more reaction time (to stay in front of a rushing player). Consequently, it is usually only used in a situation that will require passing. Some defensive linemen employ this stance to pass rush because they naturally obtain more quickness and agility out of it (particularly the defensive ends).\n\nThe \"two-points\" on the ground in this stance are just the feet. They are placed shoulder width apart pointing forward. One of the feet is staggered back, for an o-lineman this will be the foot away from the ball; for a d-lineman it will be the foot towards the ball. While in this stance the player's center of gravity will be slightly lowered by bending at the knees and waist. Weight is kept away from the heels to promote quickness and agility out of the stance in any direction.\n\nThe most common variation is the three-point stance. The purpose of this stance is to give the player leverage and allow more of their legs' power to be used. This is the offensive lineman's most used stance. It allows them to easily stay low and move in any direction at the snap of the ball. The interior defensive lineman use this stance for the same reason; however, it is usually slightly adjusted.\n\nThe added \"point\" is the player's strong hand on the ground (the down-hand). In higher divisions of play, ambidexterity between down-hands is required. A player entering the stance begins in a two-point stance; the player's staggered foot will be on the same side as the down-hand. The player then bends the knees and waist until the thighs and back are nearly parallel to the ground. The down-hand is merely an anchoring point for offensive linemen; typically, very little weight is put onto it. Offensive linemen may have to move in any direction so it is counterproductive to put weight on their down-hand (this only facilitates forward movement.) However, defensive players usually put more weight on their down-hand to have a more explosive start as they almost always go forward. This gives them the power of their legs coupled with forward momentum for a stronger push.\n\nThe least common variation is the four-point stance. This stance is used for maximum explosion and leverage in one direction (straight ahead of the player). Offensive linemen will typically only use it if they need to force the line forward only inches. Interior defensive lineman will use it to keep this push from happening.\n\nThe added \"point\" in this stance is the other arm. It is simply a three-point with the other hand put down. However, the hands in this case are allowed as much of the body's weight as the feet.\n\nThe three-point stance has become a staple in every football game. However, this has drawn attention to the danger it puts players in. The NFL has gained bad reputation because of the players' long-term and sometimes life-threatening complications brought about by head injuries. The NFL's commissioner, Roger Goodell, has stated the possibility of banning the three-point stance because it makes linemen more likely to initiate head-to-head contact.\n"}

Also absent from the world top-10 were Nana Dzagnidze and Kateryna Lagno (they were replaced by two spots from E13).\n\nThe participating players were seeded by their March 2015 FIDE rating (shown after the players below). \n\nThree former world champions were in the field: Alexandra Kosteniuk seeded 5th, Antoaneta Stefanova 9th and Anna Ushenina 15th.\n\nRussia sent the most players with ten, one more than China.\nNote that 26 of the players came from countries which were former Soviet republics.\n\nTwo days per match were followed by possible tie-breaks on the next day if the match was tied. The only rest day was 1 April the day after the semi-finals. \n\nThe total prize-money was 450,000 US dollars, the same as in 2010 and 2012.\n\nThe final was the only match of the tournament which consisted of four classical games (from 2 to 5 April 2015), played on consecutive days with a rest-day between the semi-final tie-breaks and match 1. Eventual tie-breaks, if needed, were scheduled to play on 6 April 2015, in the same manner as the whole tournament: two rapid games (25+10), i.e. 25 minutes for the whole game plus 10 seconds increment, the two rapid games (10+10), two blitz games (5+3) and an armageddon decider.\n\nPogonina had the white pieces in the first game. Before the final they had met only once, in the 2007 European Individual Chess Championship, which ended in a draw.\n\nIn the final game 4, white pieces belonged to Muzychuk, who opened the game with her favorite 1.е4. Pogonina responded with her favorite 1…е5. In the Scotch Four Knights Game she tried to avoid the main variations by putting the bishop to b4 via c5. The idea allowed Black to duck the home preparation of Muzychuk. White, however, achieved a spatial advantage and overall more favorable game after the opening. Later White decided to advance kingside pawns, weakening own king. The Black also had pawn weaknesses and a sharp and dynamically balanced position emerged. On the move 41 Muzychuk carried out a simplifying combination, transposing to an endgame with two strong passed pawns against a knight. Pogonina was left with no winning chances, and the game ended in a draw on the move 56 after the move repetition. \n\nPlayers were seeded by their March rating. The standard bracket is used, i.e. seed #1 plays #64, #2 plays #63 and so on. The draw of who plays white first is done at the opening ceremony. Pairings published on 3 March.\n\n"}
