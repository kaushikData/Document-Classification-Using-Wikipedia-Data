{"id": "357740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=357740", "title": "Aloha Stadium", "text": "Aloha Stadium\n\nAloha Stadium is a stadium located in Halawa, Hawaii, a western suburb of Honolulu (though with a Honolulu address). It is the largest stadium in the state of Hawaii. Aloha Stadium is home to the University of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football team (Mountain West Conference, NCAA Division I FBS).\n\nIt hosts the NCAA's Hawai'i Bowl, and formerly was home to the National Football League's Pro Bowl from 1980 through 2016 (except in 2010 and 2015) and to the NCAA's Hula Bowl from 1975 to 1997 and again from 2006 to 2008. It also hosts numerous high school football games during the season, and serves as a venue for large concerts and events. A swap meet in the stadium's parking lot every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday draws large crowds.\n\nAloha Stadium was home field for the AAA Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) from 1975 to 1987, before the team moved to Colorado Springs.\n\nBefore 1975, Honolulu's main outdoor stadium had been Honolulu Stadium, a wooden stadium on King Street. However, it had reached the end of its useful life by the 1960s, and was well below the standards for Triple-A baseball. The need for a new stadium was hastened by the Rainbows' move to NCAA Division I. Located west of downtown Honolulu and two miles north of Honolulu International Airport, Aloha Stadium was constructed in 1975 at a cost of $37 million. The baseball field is aligned north-northwest (home plate to centerfield), as is the football field.\n\nThe first sporting event at Aloha Stadium was a college football game between Hawaii and Texas A&I (now Texas A&M-Kingsville) on September 13, 1975. Played on Saturday night, the crowd was 32,247, and the visitors prevailed, \n\nThe stadium was somewhat problematic for its initial primary tenant, the baseball Islanders. Located in west-central Oahu, it was far from the team's fan base, and many were unwilling to make the drive. Additionally, while TheBus stopped at the main gate of Honolulu Stadium, the stop for Aloha Stadium was located some distance from the gate. As a result, attendance plummeted and never really recovered—a major factor in the franchise's ultimate move to the mainland.\n\nAdditionally, stadium management initially refused to allow the use of metal spikes on the AstroTurf in May 1976. When the Tacoma Twins complied with a parent-club directive to wear the spikes, stadium management turned off the center field lights. After 35 minutes, the umpires forfeited the game to the Twins. The Islanders protested, claiming they had no control over the lights. However, the PCL sided with the Twins, citing a league rule that the home team is responsible for providing acceptable playing facilities. The teams ended the season in a tie for first in the Western Division and Hawaii won the one-game playoff in Tacoma.\n\nAs originally built, Aloha Stadium had various configurations for different sport venues and other purposes. Four movable 7,000-seat sections, each 3.5 million could move using air casters into a diamond configuration for baseball (also used for soccer), an oval for football, or a triangle for concerts. In January 2007, the stadium was permanently locked into its football configuration due to cost and maintenance issues. An engineer from Rolair Systems, the NASA spin-off company that engineered the system, claims that the problem was caused by a concrete contractor that ignored specifications for the concrete pads under the stadium.\n\nThere have been numerous discussions with Hawaii lawmakers who are concerned with the physical condition of the stadium. There are several issues regarding rusting of the facility, several hundred seats that need to be replaced, and restroom facilities that need to be expanded to accommodate more patrons. Much of the rust is due to a design mistake in the choice of weathering steel to build the stadium. It was intended to create a protective patina that would eliminate the need for painting, but in the ocean salt-laden air of Honolulu, it has never stopped rusting.\n\nA 2005 study by Honolulu engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. determined that the stadium required $99 million to be completely restored and an additional $115 million for ongoing maintenance and refurbishment over the next 20 years to extend its useful life. In early 2007, the state legislature proposed to spend $300 million to build a new facility as opposed to spending approximately $216 million to extend the life of Aloha Stadium for another years. The new stadium may also be used to attempt to lure a Super Bowl to Hawaii in the future.\n\nOne council member has said that if immediate repairs are not made within the next seven years, then the stadium will probably have to be demolished due to safety concerns. In May 2007, the state allotted $12.4 million to be used towards removing corrosion and rust from the structure.\n\nIn 2003, the stadium surface was changed from AstroTurf (which had been in place since the stadium opened) to FieldTurf. In July 2011 the field was replaced with an Act Global UBU Sports Speed S5-M synthetic turf system.\n\nIn 2008, the state of Hawaii approved the bill of $185 million to refurbish the aging Aloha Stadium. In 2010, Aloha Stadium completely retrofitted its scoreboard and video screen to be more up to date with its high definition capability. The Aloha Stadium Authority plans to add more luxury suites, replacing all seats, rusting treatments, parking lots, more restrooms, pedestrian bridge supports, enclosed lounge, and more. There is also a proposal that would close the 4 openings in the corners of the stadium to add more seats.\n\nIn 2011, the playing field was refurbished in part due to a naming rights sponsorship from Hawaiian Airlines. As a result of the sponsorship deal, the field was referred to as Hawaiian Airlines Field at Aloha Stadium.\n\nThe airline did not renew sponsorship after the deal expired in 2016. As a result, the field went unnamed until late August, when Hawaiian Tel Federal Credit Union signed a 3-year/$275,000 agreement. As of 2016, the field is now known as Hawaiian Tel Federal Credit Union Field at Aloha Stadium.\n\nIn early 2017, there was a study in the Honolulu StarAdvertiser about replacing Aloha Stadium due to safety concerns and a liability risk. The plan is to build a smaller 30,000 seat stadium on the existing property and also build commercial development around the stadium. In theory, it would save the state millions of dollars instead of renovating and keep the existing stadium as it is.\n\nIn , a three-game regular season series between Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Padres was held at the stadium. The series was played as a doubleheader on April 19 and a nationally broadcast (ESPN) game on April 20. In 1975, the Padres had played an exhibition series against the Seibu Lions of Japan's Pacific League.\n\nAloha Stadium hosted the inaugural Pan-Pacific Championship (February 20–23, 2008), a knockout soccer tournament, involving four teams from Japan's J-League, North America's Major League Soccer (MLS) and Australia/New Zealand's A-League. The 2012 Hawaiian Islands Invitational was also held at the venue.\n\nThe United States women's national soccer team was scheduled play a game against Trinidad and Tobago as part of their World Cup Winning Victory Tour at the stadium on December 6, 2015; however, the game was canceled the day before gameday due to concerns over the turf being unsafe to play on.\n\nOn June 2, 2013, the stadium played host to a rugby league test match where Samoa defeated the USA 34–10.\n\nIn June, the Brisbane Broncos from the Australasian-based National Rugby League (NRL) competition organized for a rugby league match to be played at Aloha Stadium against NRL rivals Penrith Panthers later in 2015. However, in September the NRL blocked the idea and the game didn't go ahead.\n\nAloha Stadium is also the venue for five public high school graduation ceremonies. Radford High School, Mililani High School, Aiea High School, James Campbell High School, and Pearl City High School held their 2016 graduation ceremonies at the stadium in early June.\n\n\n"}

The term billiard room is sometimes also used as synonymous with \"billiard hall\" i.e., a business providing public access to hourly-rental or coin-operated billiard tables.\n\nThe billiard room may be in the public center of the house or the private areas of the house.\n\nBilliard rooms require proper lighting and clearances for game playing. Although there are adjustable cue sticks on the market, 5 feet of clearance around the pool table is ideal.\n\nInterior designer Charlotte Moss believed that \"a billiard room is synonymous with group dynamics. It's where you mix drinks and embark on a little friendly competition...\"\n\nBilliards probably developed from one of the late-14th century or early-15th century lawn games in which players hit balls with sticks. The earliest mention of pool as an indoor table game is in a 1470 inventory list of the accounts of King Louis XI of France.\n\nFollowing the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, billiard rooms were added to some famous 18th-century cafés in Paris and other cities.\n\nAlthough billiards had long been enjoyed by both men and women, a trend towards male suites developed in 19th century Great Britain. These male suites paired billiard rooms with smoking rooms and sometimes libraries. One example of these male suites is Castle Carr near Halifax. By the turn of the century, billiard rooms were considered a standard feature in great British houses with \"House Beautiful\" claiming \"Up-to-date owners of English estates have installed billiard rooms...\"\n\nMany mid- and late-19th century billiard rooms were designed in an Oriental or Moorish style. Mark Twain's billiard room in Hartford, CT was decorated with quasi-Moorish stencils.\n\nThe late 19th and early 20th century represent the billiard room's heyday.\n"}

In 1902 the estate was sold to the Burnley Corporation and despite the fact that most of the park remained in situ they did agree the sale of a plot of land that ran alongside the River Calder and the Hall's north access road. This ten acre plot was in the area known as Towneley Holmes.\n\nThe stadium could be accessed from either the east or west side, on the east side the path was opposite the Smalley Street junction with Woodgrove Road and cut across Towneley Park meeting the Hall's north access road. The stadium kennels were adjacent to this path situated on the north side of the stadium. From the west there was footbridge over the River Calder that met the Hall's north access road. Whichever entry was chosen resulted in the same turnstile entrances on the east side of the stadium being used where the main stand overlooked the course.\n\nA local company with a share capital of £13,000 purchased and constructed the greyhound track which was a very large 570 yards in circumference. The first race night was held on 3 September 1927 with seven thousand attending the meeting opened by Lady O’Hagan. \n\nThe greyhounds initially housed at the Burnley track consisted of 100 brought mainly from Hull. The stadium came under the control of a company called the Associated Greyhound Racecourses with Towneley becoming their second of three tracks that they would eventually own. The first being Darnall Stadium and the third was the Old Craven Park in Hull. Towneley also hosted dirt track speedway in 1929.\n\nHaulage businessman Bill Sharples had a litter out of track bitch Calliope, sired by Grand National finalist Douro and trainers included Jack Hillman (a former England goalkeeper) and Jack Ashworth. In 1931 just four years after opening the Associated Greyhound Racecourses went bankrupt with the track then being taken over by a local businessman named W Spencer who closed the stadium blaming the government betting bill that restricted the days that tracks could race. With meetings limited to a maximum of 101 per annum the management put the stadium, kennels and equipment up for auction. \n\nDuring 1935 the stadium was taken over by Captain Ramsbottom who had replaced Harry Bury as the judge and handicapper under a previous promotion. Ramsbottom then made a quick profit by selling onto two brothers Dr. and Clem Hodgson with the last greyhound meeting taking place on 2 November 1935.\nThe buildings associated to the stadium (stands, shelters and kennels) were demolished and the track was filled in as the site became playing fields. \n\nA golf course then spread its wings north and incorporated the site into the course. The position of the stadium today would have been on the northerly holes of a golf course, exactly on the opposite side of the River Calder to the £33 million Unity College.\n"}
{"id": "8497130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8497130", "title": "Canine hydrotherapy", "text": "Canine hydrotherapy\n\nCanine hydrotherapy is a form of hydrotherapy directed at the treatment of chronic conditions, post-operative recovery, and pre-operative or general fitness in dogs.\n\nA number of conditions in dogs may be aggravated by or may show slow or no improvement as a result of weight bearing exercise. Among these are hip dysplasia and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), conditions most common in medium to large purebred dogs, such as German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers or Golden Retrievers; chronic degenerative radiculomyelopathy (CDRM), a degenerative disease of the spinal cord which causes hind limb problems in German Shepherds; and luxating patella which is seen predominantly in small and toy breeds.\n\nInjuries to the cruciate ligament or other ligaments may make post-operative weight-bearing exercise in dogs problematic. Obese dogs, while requiring exercise, may aggravate existing conditions or injure themselves due to the weight exerted on their joints if walked normally.\n\nHydrotherapy for humans has been used since ancient times, and some attempt at formalizing treatment was made during the 18th century. Similarly, the benefits of sea water for the treatment and prevention of leg injuries in horses has been known for centuries. Because of the financial benefits surrounding the treatment of race horses, around the mid-19th century inventors began to produce devices to replicate the benefits of cold sea water immersion for horses.\n\nThe greyhound racing industry eventually recognized the benefits of the equine treatment and in the UK was brought to the forefront by a specialized canine hydrotherapy pool. From there, the therapy was extended to dogs in general.\nThis had led to the development of underwater treadmills to relieve stress on the animals joints whilst building strength. These have been a turning point in the rehabilitation of dogs as they can be placed in smaller areas, but offer a controlled treatment.\n\nPool designs for canine hydrotherapy vary, but most have generic elements. The pool tends to be smaller than a human swimming pool and is heated. (This is unlike equine hydrotherapy pools. Horses generate a lot of body heat when swimming, so equine pools use cold water to prevent the animal overheating.) A dog's muscles benefit from the warming effects of the heated water. Most pools have a ramp for entry and exit and some have harnesses to maintain the dog in position in the water. There may be a manual or electric hoist for lifting dogs in and out of the water. Water is chlorinated or treated with an alternative chemical. Some have jets to add resistance and make the dog swim more strongly.\n\nAs an alternative or complement to weight-bearing exercise and medication, canine hydrotherapy may speed recovery after operations or slow the progression of degenerative conditions. It may be used as a pre-operative fitness regime to allow a dog to maintain condition before an operation if it can not exercise normally. When a congenital condition is identified in a puppy, it may be the case that surgery is not possible until the animal is physically mature; during the period preceding the surgery, hydrotherapy can be employed to maintain the dog's condition.\n\nSpinal injuries or surgery can cause impairment of motor function, which may be treated by allowing the dog to exercise in water; it provides support and allows the dog to exercise its muscles while nerve regeneration is taking place. Degenerative conditions can make normal weight bearing exercise difficult and pressure on joints and limbs may aggravate some conditions, so hydrotherapy can be used in these cases to allow the dog to exercise in an environment where there is no pressure on the affected areas.\n\nObese dogs can build fitness and lose weight as a result of exercise in a hydrotherapy pool without putting excessive weight on their joints. Hydrotherapy may be used as part of a general fitness routine for dogs.\n\n"}

The Bulldogs then became charter members of the Pacific Coast Professional Football League in 1940 and played in Gilmore Stadium until 1948, when the team moved to Long Beach, California, for its (and the league's) final season. The stadium was also home to another professional football teams, the Los Angeles Mustangs of the Pacific Coast Professional Football League. Gilmore Stadium was the site of two 1940 National Football League (NFL) Pro Bowls.\n\nThe stadium was home to the collegiate Loyola Marymount Lions football team and Pepperdine Waves football team. \n\nOn January 14, 1940, the 1939 NFL champion Green Bay Packers met an All-Star team consisting of players from the nine other NFL clubs in the second NFL All-Star game in history. The Packers won 16–7.\n\nExtra seating was added to accommodate 21,000 fans for the Pro Bowl for the 1940 NFL season. The crowd set a record as the largest to view a Los Angeles pro game. The event was held on December 29, 1940. The game pitted the 1940 NFL Champion Chicago Bears against an All-Star team from the other NFL clubs in the third NFL All-Star game. The Bears won 28–14.\n\nThe Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League played here early in the in 1939 season, while awaiting completion of Gilmore Field's construction. The diamond was situated in the southwest \"corner\" of the stadium, with right field so close that baseballs hit over the fence in that area were ground-rule doubles.\n\nWhile the first modern day midget car racing program took place at Hughes Stadium in Sacramento, California in June 1933, and Loyola Stadium became the starting point in Southern California in August 1933, Gilmore Stadium is often billed as the first track purposely built for the new style of racing. The track hosted midget car racing from the track's debut in May 1934 to 1950. The 1939 Turkey Night Grand Prix was held at the track.\n\nRodger Ward drove Vic Edelbrock's midget car in a famous August 10, 1950 event at Gilmore Stadium. Ward shocked the racing world by breaking Offenhauser engine's winning streak by sweeping the events at Gilmore Stadium that night.\n\nNotable drivers that raced at the track include Bill Betteridge, Fred Friday, Walt Faulkner, Perry Grimm, Sam Hanks, Curly Mills, Danny Oakes, Roy Russing, Bob Swanson, Bill Vukovich, Rodger Ward, and Karl Young. Drivers that were killed at the track include Ed Haddad, Swede Lindskog, Speedy Lockwood, Frankie Lyons, and Chet Mortemore.\n\nIn the sixteen years of the stadium's existence, over 5 million fans attended races at the track. The stadium drew crowds over 18,000 people each race. Attendance dropped to below 9,000 at normal weekly races by the late 1940s. The attendance drop and increased demand for property in West Hollywood led to the track's sale in 1950. It was torn down in 1951. Some of its grandstand was installed at Saugus Speedway.\n\nIt also hosted donkey baseball, dog shows, rodeos, and at least one cricket match. Esther Williams performed in a diving and water ballet performance. A temporary above ground pool was constructed for the event. Several professional boxing title matches where held in the stadium. U.S. President Harry S. Truman delivered his \"stiff upper lip\" speech in the stadium.\n\nGilmore Stadium was featured in a 1934 Three Stooges short featuring a football game, and fittingly titled \"Three Little Pigskins\". The scoreboard, with the name of the stadium, appears prominently in several shots, as does a billboard advertising Gilmore products. A sign for the nearby Fairfax Theater, across Beverly Boulevard at the north (open) end of the stadium, is also visible in the background a couple of times.\n\nOn May 19, 1947, Gilmore Stadium was packed with people waiting to hear a speech by Progressive Party candidate for President Henry A. Wallace. Wallace served as vice president under FDR and was also the Secretary of Agriculture (his specialty) and Secretary of Commerce. Also speaking at the event was actress Katharine Hepburn, whose speech stole the show.\n\n"}

From 2004 through 2014, MLB games had increased from an average of 2.85 hours to 3.13 hours. This was in spite of decreases in scoring, with MLB teams scoring 4.1 runs per game in 2014, down from 5.14 in 2000.\n\nIn college baseball, the Southeastern Conference experimented with a 20-second pitch clock during the 2010 season, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association instituted the pitch clock before the 2011 season for when no runners are on base.\nDuring the 2014 season, the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball instituted its own changes. These included a 12-second pitch clock, reducing timeouts, warm-up pitches, making intentional walks automatic by signalling the umpire, rather than throwing four intentional balls. The Arizona Fall League began using a pitch clock 2014 and the Double-A and Triple-A levels of Minor League Baseball followed suit in 2015. Those levels saw a 12-minute reduction in game times.\n\nTowards the end of the 2014 season, Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig announced the formation of a committee to examine the issue. John Schuerholz chaired the committee, which also included Sandy Alderson, Tony Clark, Rob Manfred, Joe Torre, and Tom Werner.

{"id": "4880373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4880373", "title": "Primus stove", "text": "Primus stove\n\nThe Primus stove, the first pressurized-burner kerosene (paraffin) stove, was developed in 1892 by Frans Wilhelm Lindqvist, a factory mechanic in Stockholm. The stove was based on the design of the hand-held blowtorch; Lindqvist’s patent covered the burner, which was turned upward on the stove instead of outward as on the blowtorch. The same year, Lindqvist partnered with and established J.V. Svenson’s Kerosene Stove Factory for manufacturing the new stoves which were sold under the name Primus. The first model was the No.1 stove, which was quickly followed by a number of similarly-designed stoves of different models and sizes. Shortly thereafter, B.A. Hjorth & Co. (later Bahco), a tool and engineering firm begun in Stockholm in 1889, acquired the exclusive rights to sell the Primus stove.\n\nThe efficient Primus stove quickly earned a reputation as a reliable and durable stove in everyday use, and it performed especially well under adverse conditions: it was the stove of choice for Fridtjof Nansen's North Pole attempt, Roald Amundsen's South Pole expedition, and Richard Byrd’s North Pole expedition. Primus stoves also accompanied George Mallory's ill-fated expedition to Mount Everest in 1924, as well as Tenzing and Hillary's successful one in 1953. While many other companies also made portable stoves of a similar design to the Primus, this style is often generically referred to as a “Primus” stove, regardless of the manufacturer.\n\nThe Primus No. 1 stove, made of brass, consists of a fuel tank at the base, above which is a \"rising tube\" and the burner assembly. A steel top ring on which to set a pot is held above the burner by three support legs. Other Primus-style stoves may be larger or smaller, but have the same basic design. The No. 1 stove weighs about 2½ pounds, and measures about 8½ inches high with an overall diameter of just under 7 inches. The tank, about 3½ inches high, holds a little over two pints of kerosene and will burn for about four hours on a full tank.\n\nTo light the stove, the user pours a small amount of alcohol into a circular \"spirit cup\" just below the burner and lights it to pre-heat the burner assembly. When it is hot, the user pressurizes the tank by means of a small hand pump integrated into the housing, which forces kerosene from the tank up through the rising tube (A) and the ascending pipe (B) to the pre-heated burner head (C), where the fuel is heated and vapourized. The kerosene vapour is then forced under pressure through the descending tube (D) to the vapour nozzle (E); here it sprays through a jet in the middle of the burner, where it mixes with air and burns in a sootless blue flame. The heat from that flame vapourizes more fuel to sustain the process when the spirit cup burns out. The user can pump the tank more to increase the pressure and make the flame larger; turning a small \"air screw\" (usually located in the filler cap) will release pressure from the tank and make the flame smaller.\n\nIf no alcohol is available for lighting, a twist of cloth or even dry grass will form a wick in the spirit cup. Pumping once will dispense a small amount of kerosene to dribble down into the cup which will then light using the wick. As the flame dies down, a further gentle pump will either ignite the main burner or dispense more kerosene into the spirit cup.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the Primus, kerosene stoves were constructed in the same manner as oil lamps, which use a wick to draw fuel from the tank to the burner and which produce a great deal of soot due to incomplete combustion. The Primus stove's design, which uses pressure and heat to vapourize the kerosene before ignition, results in a hotter, more efficient stove that does not soot. Because it did not use a wick and did not produce soot, the Primus stove was advertised as the first \"sootless\" and \"wickless\" stove.\n\n"}

It was devised and developed by Arthur Rowe, who was the then manager of English football club Tottenham Hotspur from 1949. \n\nThe push-and-run style involved quickly laying the ball off to a teammate and running past the marking tackler to collect the return pass. It proved an effective way to move the ball at pace, with players' positions and responsibility being fluid.\n\nImplementing this new and unique style, Tottenham ran away with their first ever league title. In 1951 they won the First Division Championship and became the first side to win Second and First Divisions in successive seasons.\n\nThe \"push and run\" style of play was first developed by Arthur Rowe at Tottenham Hotspur. Rowe himself would credit Peter McWilliam, the Spurs manager under whom he served, with teaching him how to play a quick passing style of game from which Rowe then extended into \"push and run\". This possession-based game of play of McWilliam has been traced back to Scottish players who first conceived of the idea of keeping possession of the ball instead of dribbling and charging in their first ever football international against England in 1872.\n\nAside from Rowe, McWilliam also taught other Spurs players such as Bill Nicholson and Vic Buckingham such possession-based passing game. Buckingham would then pass on this pass-and-move style of play when he went on to manage Barcelona and Ajax, where it would influence the development of Total Football.\n"}
{"id": "8484065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8484065", "title": "Ringette", "text": "Ringette\n\nRingette is a team sport with two variations, an indoor and an outdoor version. The winter sport is played on an ice rink. One indoor court version is called gym ringette.\n\nThe game objective is to outscore the opposing team. The sport is played on an ice surface, primarily by females, and requires the use of ice hockey skates. The sport uses a blue rubber pneumatic ring and all players, with the exception of goaltenders, use a straight stick with no blade. One of the sport's most recognizable and defining features is the fact that it does not involve the use of intentional body contact as a strategic component. Despite its primary popularity among female participants, the sport is officially mixed.\n\nIn the sport's home nation, Canada, the nations elite ringette players play in the National Ringette League (NRL). The final competition is held annually at the Canadian Ringette Championships. The winning team in the NRL division is awarded the Jeanne Sauvé Memorial Cup named after the late Governor General of Canada, Jeanne Sauvé. Initially coined the \"Jeanne Sauvé Cup\" and initiated in December 1984, it was first presented at the 1985 Canadian Ringette Championships in Dollard des Ormeaux, Québec. It is now entitled the Jeanne Sauvé Memorial Cup, in memory of the late Governor General of Canada and is awarded to the best team in the National Ringette League.\n\nRingette is a winter season team sport played on an ice rink using ice skates. From its beginnings on a skating rink in 1963 in Espanola, Ontario, the sport has spread to the United States, Finland, Sweden, and France. In Canada, an annual national level competition is held called the Canadian Ringette Championships. The sport is also included in the Canada Winter Games.\n\nRingette was invented in 1963 by the Northern Ontario Recreation Directors Association (NORDA), led by the two founders of ringette, Sam Jacks, from West Ferris, Ontario, director of Parks and Recreation for the city of North Bay, Ontario and Mirl \"Red\" McCarthy, recreation director for the town of Espanola, Ontario. The title of birthplace of ringette is shared by both North Bay, Ontario, and Espanola, Ontario, where the first game was played in the fall of 1963 under the direction of McCarthy. \n\nNORDA was a regional organization composed of members from a large area that included the Ontario communities of North Bay, Espanola, Deep River, Elliot Lake, Huntsville, Sturgeon Falls, Timmins, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, Onaping and Phelps, as well as Témiscaming, Québec. This body recognized the problem of limited girls' winter recreational programmes and decided to find a solution.\n\nThe first time the name \"ringette\" is mentioned was at the NORDA meetings held on January 20 and 21, 1963 in Sudbury, Ontario. Sam Jacks advised the group that \"he had been working on a new girls' court game\". Jacks had first considered an inside floor game for females, presumably based on his previous success with floor hockey.\n\nAt their September 15 and 16, 1963 meeting at North Bay's RCAF base, Sam Jacks informed the group that he would \"like to have NORDA receive credit as a body for the birth of this game.\" Each one of the sports directors left this meeting agreeing to develop the game in their own community and report their findings at the next NORDA meeting in early 1964.\n\nUnder the guidance of Mirl Arthur \"Red\" McCarthy, the first game of ringette was held between Espanola high school girls at the Espanola Arena in the fall of 1963. He wrote up a set of rules and created a ring for this occasion, still on display inside the Espanola arena.\n\nIn 1963-1964, McCarthy's original ringette rules became experimental in the following Northern Ontario and Quebec communities:\n\n\nMcCarthy presented a written list of rules which he had developed, combined with comments and observations to NORDA at their meeting at Moose Lake Lodge in Onaping, Ontario (Sudbury), on January 19 and 20, 1964.\n\nIn 1964-1965, Sudbury, Ontario formed the first ever ringette league, comprising four teams. Diana Heit, assistant program director of Sudbury Parks and Recreation department, helped the teams with schedules, rules, and coaching.\n\nOn March 5, 1966, the first invitational tournament, the Northern Ontario and Quebec championships, was held in Temiscaming, Quebec. The tournament took place with five teams participating: North Bay Police Playground, Sudbury Rose Marie Playground, Sudbury East End Playground, Temiscaming Reds, and Temiscaming Whites. The tournament was won by the Temiscaming Reds team. This historic tournament created many firsts for the game of ringette:\n\n\nRingette was introduced in North Bay on January 21, 1965, at the Kiwanis Playground with teams from Kiwanis and Police zones participating. The game ended in a 5-5 overtime tie. Attempts were being made to form a four-team league. Growth in ringette came slowly to North Bay as ice time was seldom available. It was not until 1971-72 that West Ferris, Ontario, today part of North Bay, had a four-team league operating.\n\nRingette was introduced to the province of Québec by Bob Reid, director of recreation for Témiscaming, secretary, and chairman of NORDA.\n\nBy 1965-66, NORDA decided that they had carried the game about as far as it could go. The Society of Directors of Municipal Recreation of Ontario (SDMRO) was chosen to develop and organize it further on a larger scale.\n\nBy 1973, an agreement was worked out between SDMRO and the Ontario Ringette Association (ORA) where the copyright to the Official Ringette Rules would be held by the ORA. Finally, in 1983 in agreement with the ORA, these rights were acquired by Ringette Canada.\n\nThe West Ferris Arena, today called the West Ferris Centennial Community Centre, was built in 1967, four years after the birth of the sport in 1963 at the Espanola arena. The West Ferris arena, surrounding ball fields, and tennis courts is together called the Sam Jacks Recreational Complex.\n\nAfter Sam Jacks died in May 1975, his wife Agnes promoted the game and acted as an ambassador for the sport until her own death in April 2005. She was awarded the Order of Canada.\n\n\nThe format of game is 2 halves with 15 minutes in each period.\n\nHowever, in the National Ringette League the format of the game is 4 quarters 15 minutes each with a 15-minute break between the second and third quarters. \nOnly six players on each team are permitted on the ice at one time, one centre, two forwards, two defenders, and a goaltender.\n\nA team may pull the goalie off the ice and one more player may go in the offensive or defensive end. If the goalie is pulled and the play returns to that team's defensive end, one skater may become an acting goaltender. Once she enters the crease, she is bound by the same rules as a regular goaltender.\n\nThe game begins with the visiting team receiving control of the ring on the defending half of the center circle. One player from the visiting team must pass the ring to another player within five seconds, without leaving the half circle or crossing the centre line, or else possession is lost and granted to the home team.\n\nPlayers are not permitted to carry the ring over the two blue lines; they must advance the ring over the line only by passing it to another player. The ring must be touched by any other player first, but does not need to be under control before the passer take possession again (e.g., the passer bounces the ring off a player's skate and then picks it up). If a player touches the ring consecutively on both sides of the blue line their team loses possession and the opposing team is given a free pass. If the ring goes over both blue lines, the team that passed it may not touch it until the opposing team touches the ring.\n\nIf a goaltender throws the ring across the blue line, a delayed violation is signalled. The goaltender may use their stick to pass the ring over the blue line.\n\nThe red line at the top of the defensive circles is called the Free Play Line. It marks the restricted area of each team's attacking/defending zones. Only three players from each team, plus the defending goaltender, are permitted into the restricted areas.\n\nExceptions include:\n\nIf the violation is non-intentional, the team in violation will lose possession of the ring and have it granted to the non-offending team. If the violation is deemed intentional, a delay of game penalty is assessed (rare). If an intentional violation occurs in the last two minutes of the game, a penalty shot is awarded instead. The Extended Zone Line is also known as the \"ringette line\".\n\nThe crease is essentially an invisible wall from ice to ceiling located in front of the goal mouth and defined by a red semi circle on the ice. Goaltenders are the only players permitted in the crease. If a member of the team with ring possession violates the crease with a stick, skate, arm, etc., the play is stopped and the goalie receives the ring. If any member of the non-possession team violates the crease, their team cannot touch the ring for five seconds (counted by the referee), or possession of the ring is given to the other team.\n\nWhen the ring enters the crease, the goaltender then has five seconds to throw, pass with stick, deflect, or push the ring out to another player. If the goalie does not pass it within five seconds, the ring is awarded to the other team for a free pass from one of the defensive free play circles. The goalie may use the stick to touch the ring outside the crease, and can also pass through the crease, but may not pull it into the crease unless she pulls it all the way through and out with one motion. Otherwise, this results in a loss of possession, and a penalty if she has already been given a warning. The goalie may not pick up or cover the ring with her glove outside the crease. The goalie can push the ring with a hand when outside the crease, as can any other player.\n\nThe team in possession of the ring has 30 seconds to shoot, it is not always played this way with the younger girls (Active start, and U10), or it gives up possession to the other team. The shot clock is reset when possession of the ring changes teams, when the ring stops in the goaltender's crease, or when the ring bounces off of the goalie or the front of the goal posts. The shot clock is only applied in competitive levels, starting at the petite level (U12).\n\nA violation is a minor penalty called for violations of game play rules, usually due to improper movement or handling of the ring. Common violations include entering the crease, touching the ring on either side of the blue line, four players in the zone and 2 (blue) line passes.\n\nIf a violation is committed by the team in possession of the ring, play is stopped immediately. The ring is awarded to the opposing team in the zone the violation occurred. If a violation is committed by the team not in possession of the ring, a 'delayed violation' is signaled by the official (arm raised with a 90 degree bend at the elbow) and a 5-second count begins. If the team in violation touches the ring within that time period, play is stopped and the violation is assessed. If the count expires, the violation is dropped and play continues.\n\nIf a violation occurs that would award the defending team a free pass in their own zone, the ring is given to the goaltender as a \"goalie ring\". Play resumes immediately when the goaltender receives the ring. Time is not provided for teams to perform line changes as can be done on a free pass, although on-the-fly changes are permitted as in normal play.\n\nPenalties in ringette have the same concept as in hockey, with the notable exception that less body contact is allowed, and fighting has a zero-tolerance policy. Penalties are of the following classes:\n\n\n-- body contact, slashing, tripping, boarding, charging and any other physical contact penalty, and unsportsmanlike can become a four-minute major penalty depending on the severity and roughness. Players may also receive multiple penalties at the same time for a combination of four or more minutes.\n\n\nWhen a penalty is assessed against the goalie, a teammate on the ice at the time of the offence must serve it.\n\nIf the team not in control of the ring commits a penalty, play is not stopped until the penalized team gains control. This is called a delayed penalty. A minor penalty is nullified if a goal is scored during the delay, unless penalties of equal class were called on both teams. While the penalty is delayed, the attacking team can add a sixth skater to the ice by pulling their goalie. This player can enter the play zone as the fourth attacker.\n\nA team can work off at most two penalties at a time. If a team commits a third penalty, the penalized player sits in the penalty box, but her interval does not start until the first of the other penalties expires (and so forth if there are more penalties). A team plays with a minimum of three skaters on the ice, regardless of the number of penalties. If freeing a player from the penalty box would give the team more players on the ice than it is entitled to (such as when the team is down to three attackers, but there are two other players in the penalty box), she will not be freed until a whistle stops play. During the stoppage, the team must remove one player from the ice to return to its proper strength.\n\nA team with two penalties can have only two players (instead of the usual three) in its defensive zone. But if a third person is active in the defensive zone while two man down a third penalty will be called. If there is a third penalty that penalty time does not start till the first penalty is over. All three players may enter the offensive zone.\n\nRequired equipment for ringette is similar to ice hockey:\nThe ringette facemask is much like a hockey one except the bars are spaced so that the end of a ringette stick cannot enter the mask. (bars are shaped as triangles, not squares)\n\nRingette sticks have tapered ends, with plastic or metal tips specially designed with grooves to increase the lift and velocity of the wrist shot. A ringette stick is also reinforced to withstand the body weight of a player – a ring carrier leans heavily on his/her stick to prevent opposing players from removing the ring. Sticks are flexible and lightweight to bend without breaking.\n\nRingette is currently not in the Olympics. In its homeland of Canada, stemming the game in order to have the sport recognized by the International Olympic Committee for inclusion in the winter Olympic games is underway. Marketing methods have included using social media as well as word of mouth.\n\nRingette has thus far been excluded from the Olympics partly due to the fact that it must have 25% of each gender to qualify. The sport is typically overlooked by male participants due to its lack of widespread recognition and the more widespread availability of other organized winter sports like ice hockey. Currently, there are not enough males with the skill to qualify for an Olympic team.\n\nThere are several levels of play in Ringette, categorized by age. Divisions were recently renamed as U* divisions under the new Long Term Development Plan (LTDP) rolled out nationally by Ringette Canada for the 2009-10 ringette season:\nNRL Known as the National Ringette league, for elite players aged 18+\n\nIn 2010 the league put back in place previous age groups.\n\nBoys are permitted to play at any age level but are restricted to competing at the \"B\" level or lower in many places, however efforts to include male players at the AA level is increasing. It isn't uncommon to see boys participating above U9 or U6 divisions in some provinces. Due to the pure speed of the sport, skating is emphasized at these levels. Levels of competition, based on skill, range from recreational to competitive, and include: Rec, C, B, BB, A, and AA and AAA, with AA being the highest level at which league competition occurs. AAA ringette is typically specific to particular regions who feel another category is necessary to clarify their league or tournament play. For example: AAA teams out of Quebec have played AA teams out of Alberta at various tournaments, including the National Championships. In Alberta, the highest level considered is AA, although they are deemed equal to the AAA teams from areas such as Quebec. For those who like the hockey parallel, playing AA ringette is the same as playing AAA hockey. The National Ringette League was introduced in 2004-2005 season and includes open-aged players at AA/AAA level.\n\nThe National Ringette League (also indicated by the initials NRL) is an elite league of ringette in Canada. The NRL groups together the very best players over the age of 19 in Canada. The NRL consists of fifteen teams separated into two conferences. The Western Conference has 5 teams and the Eastern Conference has 10 teams. The NRL recovers directly from Ringette Canada, the guiding organisation for Ringette in Canada.\n\nThe Championnats Canadien d'Ringuette/Canadian Ringette Championships took place for the first time in 1979 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. This tournament was conceived so as to be able to determine who are the Canadian champions in the categories Under-16 years, Under-19 years and Open (replaced by the National Ringette League since 2008). The Canadian Championships of ringette usually take place in April of every year.\n\nThe annual competition groups together Canadian universities in 2 conferences and is organized by the association Canadian University Ringette \n\nUniversity Champions \nThe Canada Winter Games are a multi-sport competition of two weeks duration. The Canada Games represent an important national competition. Twenty one sports appear. Ringette takes part in the event during one of two weeks of the Canada Games. Usually the competition begins on Mondays followed by the semi-final on Friday evening and of the National final on Saturdays. The best ringette athletes of ten provinces meet under the banner of teams of each of the provinces there. The Winter Games are held in every 4 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe provinces of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario have competed in the Eastern Canadian Ringette Championships (ECRC) in the following 4 divisions since 2002: (U14AA, U16A, U19A and 18+ A).\n\nThe provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia have competed annually in the Western Canadian Ringette Championships (WCRC) since 2003, at the levels of U14AA, U16A, U19A, and 18+ A.\n\nSome of the Canada's national level ringette players have also played for the Canadian women's national bandy team. Their best results are 4th at the 2007 Women's Bandy World Championship and 2010.\n\nCanada's first goal scored in the nations history of organized women's bandy was by Lindsay Burns. Burns has also played for Canada's National Ringette Team.\n\nInternationally, half-a-dozen countries currently participate and organize in the sport of Ringette, particularly those situated in the Northern Hemisphere. Ringette is currently organized and played in the countries of Canada, Finland, Sweden, United States, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia, with the largest community in Canada. In Canada over 50,000 participants register annually.\n\nElite level ringette leagues are present in Scandinavia and in Canada.\n\nCanada, Finland and Sweden are members of the International Ringette Federation (IRF) established in 1986. Canada and Finland have always been the most active ambassadors in the International Federation. Canada and Finland regularly travel across various countries to demonstrate how ringette is played. Canadian teams have demonstrated in countries including as Japan, Australia, Iceland, and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2012, the Ringette International Federation announced new promotion activities in Norway, Slovakia, as well as in South Korea.\n\nIn 1979, Juhani Wahlsten introduced ringette in Finland. Wahlsten created some teams in Turku. Finland's first ringette club was Ringetteläisiä Turun Siniset and the country's first ringette tournament took place in December, 1980. In 1979 Juhani Wahlsten invited two coaches Wendy King and Evelyn Watson from Dollard des Ormeaux ( a suburb of Montreal Quebec. Canada to teach girls of various ages how to play ringette \n\nThe Ringette Association of Turku was established in 1981 and several Canadian coaches went there to make of the training and formation. The ski national week then organized an annual tournament to bring together all the ringette teams.\n\nThe National Association of Ringuette of Finland was created in 1983.\n\nThe 1985 tournament included several hundred girls. It became impossible to combine into a single event all the age groups and all the categories of players.\n\nThe visit of different Canadian teams in the winter of 1986 increased the popularity of the sport. Currently 10,000 young Finnish girls participate in 31 ringette clubs. Several cities have important clubs: Naantali, Turku, Uusikaupunki.\n\nFinnish ringette takes place at the local amateur level to the professional level with the elite league Ringeten SM-Sarja. This professional women league established in 1987 and consists of eight clubs in 2011-2012 season:\n\n\nRingette was introduced to Sweden in the 1980s. The first ringette club was Ulriksdals, in Stockholm. The national federation of ringette was established in 1990 and the elite league Ringetteförbundet was established in 1994. The league groups together 7 professional women clubs:\n\nSeveral junior teams, and numerous amateur teams are connected with these 7 semi-pro clubs. Most Swedish ringette associations are located in the Mälardalen region. There are programs of \"twin towns\" between Swedish ringette association and Canadian associations for the development of the sport within the Swedish population. More than 6,000 girls are registered annually.\n\nThe National Ringette Team of the USA competes regularly at the World Ringette Championships. The two major national sporting organization for ringette in the USA are USA Ringette and Team USA Ringette.\n\nAt the beginning, the World Ringette Championships were held every other year. But since the world championship of 2004 held in Sweden, the World Championships are held once every three years. The winning national team is awarded the Sam Jacks Trophy.\n\nThe first World Championships were held in 1990 in the city of Gloucester in Ontario, Canada. Three countries participated: Canada, Finland and United States, sending a total of 8 teams. Finland finished seventh and the United States eighth while Canadian teams monopolized the podium.\n\nThe second world Championship took place in 1992 in Helsinki, in Finland. There were two Canada teams, Finland, United States, France, Sweden and Russia.\n\nThe third World Championship was played in 1994 in Minnesota, United States. There were two Canada teams, Finland, United States, Sweden and Russia. Finland won the World Cup, its very first world championship.\n\nThe 1996 World Championships took place in Stockholm, Sweden. Canada won the gold medal beating Finland 6-5 in extra time.\n\nSince 1994, these two countries (Canada and Finland) have battled for the world title. Finland took it in 1994 and in 2000, while Canada won the gold medal in 1996 and in 2002. The victory by Canada in 2002 is particularly notable. Having been defeated by the score 4-3 in extra time against Finland in 2000, Canada took its revenge by defeating their arch-rival by the score 3-1 in front of an arena filled with about 4,000 supporters in Edmonton, Alberta. The final match was broadcast on CBC and followed by 544,000 Canadian televiewers.\n\nSince the 2004 World Championships, Finland has dominated. The 2004 World championships were played in Stockholm, where Finland took the world championship by crushing 9-3 Canada in the final.\n\nIn 2007, the World Championships were played in Ottawa, Canada. The final game required overtime after Finnish player Marjukka Virta tied the game 4–4, and Anne Pohjola scored allowing Finland to overcome Canada 5-4. Sweden won its first medal in the World Ringette Championship (a bronze medal) by beating 10-9 United States in overtime.\n\nIn 2010, Finland won its fifth world title in front of 10,000 spectators in Tampere by again beating Canada. The United States had their revenge on Sweden defeating them 19-1.\n\nThe 2013 World Championships marked the 50th anniversary of the sport and took place in North Bay, Ontario, Canada.\n\nIn November 2008, the First World Championship of Ringette Clubs involved six of the world's best clubs. The international tournament tooh place in Sault Ste-Marie, Canada. Four teams from the National Ringette League and 2 teams from the league of Finnish league Ringeten SM-Sarja participate in it: Cambridge turbos, Montreal Mission, Calgary RATH, Richmond Hill Lightning participate with EKS-Espoo and LuKi-82 Luvia 75. The Tournament is taken gained by the Cambridge Turbos.\n\n\nThe Second World Championships of Ringette Clubs belong to Turku, in Finland, from December 27, 2011 till January 1, 2012. Canada is represented by two teams, namely the reigning world champion of clubs, the Cambridge Turbos, and by the Richmond Hill Lightning. 3 clubs represent Finland: Lapinlahden Luistin-89, Luvian Kiekko-82, Raision Nuorisokiekko Ry. The Swedish club Ulriksdals SK Ringette participate also in the international tournament. In semi-final Lapinlahden Luistin-89 overcomes 3-1 the Cambridge Turbos. Championship Finale is quite Finnish clubs because Lapinlahden Luistin 89 face Raision Nuorisokiekko Ry in the game for the golden medal. Lapinlahden Luistin-89 beats 5-4 the Raision Nuorisokiekko Ry to gain the golden medal, Tiina Randell score the victorious goals.\n\n\nThe Most Valuable Player is Anne Pohjola of Lapinlahden Luistin-89.\n\nThe first World Junior Ringette Championship took place in August, 2009 in Prague, Czech Republic: two Canadian teams, Canada West Under-19 and Canada-East Under-19 faced two Finnish teams, Finland White and Finland Blue.\n\nThe second World Junior Championship was held in December, 2012 in London, Ontario, Canada.\n\n\nCanada Post issued four stamps in a series entitled \"Canadian inventions: sports\" featuring four sports with Canadian origins: ringette, basketball, five-pin bowling and lacrosse. The commemorative stamps were issued on August 10, 2009. The stamp featured well-worn equipment used in each sport with a background line drawing of the appropriate playing surface.\n\n"}

{"id": "25405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25405", "title": "Rugby union", "text": "Rugby union\n\nRugby union, commonly known in most of the world as rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line.\n\nRugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. In 2014, there were more than 6 million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36 million were registered players. World Rugby, previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members. \n\nIn 1845, the first football laws were written by Rugby School pupils; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the Blackheath Club's decision to leave the Football Association in 1863 and the split between rugby union and rugby league in 1895. Historically an amateur sport, in 1995 restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.\n\nRugby union spread from the Home Nations of Great Britain and Ireland and was absorbed by many of the countries associated with the British Empire. Early exponents of the sport included Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France. Countries that have adopted rugby union as their \"de facto\" national sport include Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar, New Zealand, Samoa and Tonga. \n\nInternational matches have taken place since 1871, when the first game took place between Scotland and England at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. The Rugby World Cup, first held in 1987, takes place every four years. The Six Nations Championship in Europe and The Rugby Championship in the Southern Hemisphere are other major international competitions, held annually.\n\nNational club or provincial competitions include the Premiership in England, the Top 14 in France, the Mitre 10 Cup in New Zealand, the National Rugby Championship in Australia, and the Currie Cup in South Africa. Other transnational club competitions include the Pro14 in Europe and South Africa, the European Rugby Champions Cup solely in Europe, and Super Rugby, in the Southern Hemisphere and Japan.\n\nThe origin of rugby football is reputed to be an incident during a game of English school football at Rugby School in 1823, when William Webb Ellis is said to have picked up the ball and run with it. Although the evidence for the story is doubtful, it was immortalised at the school with a plaque unveiled in 1895. Despite the doubtful evidence, the Rugby World Cup trophy is named after Webb Ellis. Rugby football stems from the form of game played at Rugby School, which former pupils then introduced to their university.\n\nOld Rugbeian Albert Pell, a student at Cambridge, is credited with having formed the first \"football\" team. During this early period different schools used different rules, with former pupils from Rugby and Eton attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities.\n\nA significant event in the early development of rugby football was the production of the first written laws of the game at Rugby School in 1845, which was followed by the Cambridge Rules drawn up in 1848. Other important events include the Blackheath Club's decision to leave the Football Association in 1863 and the formation of the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The code was originally known as \"rugby football\"; it was not until after the schism in England in 1895, which resulted in the separate code of rugby league, that the sport took on the name \"rugby union\" to differentiate it from the league game. Despite the sport's full name of rugby union, it is known simply as rugby throughout most of the world.\n\nThe first rugby football international was played on 27 March 1871 between Scotland and England in Edinburgh. Scotland won the game 1-0. By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams, and in 1883 the first international competition, the Home Nations Championship had begun. 1883 is also the year of the first rugby sevens tournament, the Melrose Sevens, which is still held annually.\n\nTwo important overseas tours took place in 1888: a British Isles team visited Australia and New Zealand—although a private venture, it laid the foundations for future British and Irish Lions tours; and the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team brought the first overseas team to British spectators.\nDuring the early history of rugby union, a time before commercial air travel, teams from different continents rarely met. The first two notable tours both took place in 1888the British Isles team touring New Zealand and Australia, followed by the New Zealand team touring Europe. Traditionally the most prestigious tours were the Southern Hemisphere countries of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa making a tour of a Northern Hemisphere, and the return tours made by a joint British and Irish team. Tours would last for months, due to long traveling times and the number of games undertaken; the 1888 New Zealand team began their tour in Hawkes Bay in June and did not complete their schedule until August 1889, having played 107 rugby matches. Touring international sides would play Test matches against international opponents, including national, club and county sides in the case of Northern Hemisphere rugby, or provincial/state sides in the case of Southern Hemisphere rugby.\n\nBetween 1905 and 1908, all three major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: New Zealand in 1905, followed by South Africa in 1906 and Australia in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics, and were far more successful than critics had expected.\n\nThe New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a haka before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator Tom Williams to suggest that Wales player Teddy Morgan lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National Anthem, \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\", as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in: the first time a national anthem was sung at the start of a sporting event. In 1905 France played England in its first international match.\n\nRugby union was included as an event in the Olympic Games four times during the early 20th century. No international rugby games and union-sponsored club matches were played during the First World War, but competitions continued through service teams such as the New Zealand Army team. During the Second World War no international matches were played by most countries, though Italy, Germany and Romania played a limited number of games, and Cambridge and Oxford continued their annual University Match.\n\nThe first officially sanctioned international rugby sevens tournament took place in 1973 at Murrayfield, one of Scotland's biggest stadiums, as part of the Scottish Rugby Union centenary celebrations.\n\nIn 1987 the first Rugby World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, and the inaugural winners were New Zealand. The first World Cup Sevens tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993. Rugby Sevens was introduced into the Commonwealth Games in 1998 and was added to the Olympic Games of 2016.\n\nRugby union was an amateur sport until the IRB declared the game \"open\" in August 1995 (shortly after the completion of the 1995 World Cup), removing restrictions on payments to players. However, the pre-1995 period of rugby union was marked by frequent accusations of \"shamateurism\", including an investigation in Britain by a House of Commons Select committee in early 1995. Following the introduction of professionalism trans-national club competitions were started, with the Heineken Cup in the Northern Hemisphere and Super Rugby in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe Tri Nations, an annual international tournament involving Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, kicked off in 1996. In 2012, this competition was extended to include Argentina, a country whose impressive performances in international games (especially finishing in third place in the 2007 Rugby World Cup) was deemed to merit inclusion in the competition. As a result of the expansion to four teams, the tournament was renamed The Rugby Championship.\n\nEach team starts the match with 15 players on the field and seven or eight substitutes. Players in a team are divided into eight forwards (two more than in rugby league) and seven backs.\n\nThe main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball. Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the scrum and line-out. The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.\n\nFront row\nThe front row consists of three players: two props (the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop) and the hooker. The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs.\n\nSecond row\nThe second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialize as line-out jumpers. The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players and providing forward drive.\n\nBack row\nThe back row, not to be confused with ‘Backs’, is the third and final row of the forward positions, they are often referred to as the loose forwards. The three positions in the back row are the two flankers and the number 8. The two flanker positions called the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in the scrum. They are usually the most mobile forwards in the game. Their main role is to win possession through 'turn overs'. The number 8 packs down between the two locks at the back of the scrum. The role of the number 8 in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from the front of the pack and the position provides a link between the forwards and backs during attacking phases.\n\nThe backs' role is to create and convert point-scoring opportunities. They are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards. Another distinction between the backs and the forwards is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking and ball-handling skills, especially the fly-half, scrum-half, and full-back.\n\nHalf-backs\nThe half-backs consist of two positions, the scrum-half and the fly-half. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating the team's performance. They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout, or scrum, and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs. Many fly-halves are also their team's goal kickers. The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs. They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half. They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.\n\nThree quarters\nThere are four three quarter positions, the inside centre, outside centre and left and right wings. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack, they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences. The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries. Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are elusive runners who use their speed to avoid tackles.\n\nFullback\nThe fullback normally position themselves several metres behind the back line. They often field opposition kicks and are usually the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line. Two of the most important attributes of a good fullback are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.\n\nRugby union is played between two teams – the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a try, scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead-ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a drop goal each score 3 points. The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years. \nThe field of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of long by wide. In actual gameplay there should be a maximum of between the two try-lines, with anywhere between 10 and 22 metres behind each try line to serve as the in-goal area. Several lines cross the field, notably the halfway line and the \"twenty-two\", which is from the goal line.\n\nStricter rules apply to the pitch size for matches between national representative teams. The same maximums apply in this case, but the distance between the two try-lines must also be at least and the pitch must be at least wide.\n\nRugby goalposts are H-shaped, and consist of two poles, apart, connected by a horizontal crossbar above the ground.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team will kick off first. Play then starts with a dropkick, with the players chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying to retrieve the ball and advance it. If the ball does not reach the opponent’s 10-metre line the opposing team has two choices: to have the ball kicked off again, or to have a scrum at the centre of the half-way line.\nIf the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a ruck will result.\n\nGames are divided into 40-minute halves, with a break in the middle. The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break. Stoppages for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action do not count as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer than 80 minutes. The referee is responsible for keeping time, even when—as in many professional tournaments—he is assisted by an official time-keeper. If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues until the ball is \"dead\", and only then will the referee blow the whistle to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or free-kick, the game continues.\n\nIn the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the Rugby World Cup, two extra time periods of 10 minutes periods are played (with an interval of 5 minutes in between) if the game is tied after full-time. If scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for 20 minutes of sudden-death extra time to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner. However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.\n\nForward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards. The ball tends to be moved forward in three ways — by kicking, by a player running with it or within a scrum or maul. Only the player with the ball may be tackled or rucked. When a ball is knocked forward by a player with their arms, a \"knock-on\" is committed, and play is restarted with a scrum.\n\nAny player may kick the ball forward in an attempt to gain territory. When a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into touch so that the ball first bounces in the field of play, the throw-in is taken where the ball went into touch. If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing in-field first) from within one's own 22-metre line, the lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the 22-metre line, the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.\n\nThe aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing them to ground (a tackle, which is frequently followed by a ruck) or by contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). Such a circumstance is called a breakdown and each is governed by a specific law.\n\nTackling\n\nA player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by holding them while bringing them to ground. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds), and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a tap-tackle or ankle-tap). Tacklers may not tackle an opponent who has jumped to catch a ball until the player has landed.\n\nRucking and Mauling\n\nMauls occur after a player with the ball has come into contact with an opponent but the handler remains on his feet; once any combination of at least three players have bound themselves a maul has been set. A ruck is similar to the maul, but in this case the ball has gone to ground with at least three attacking players binding themselves on the ground in an attempt to secure the ball.\n\nWhen the ball leaves the side of the field, a line-out is awarded against the team which last touched the ball. Forward players from each team line up a metre apart, perpendicular to the touchline and between 5 m and 15 m from the touchline. The ball is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by a player (usually the hooker) from the team that did not play the ball into touch. The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in.\n\nBoth sides compete for the ball and players may lift their teammates. A jumping player cannot be tackled until they stand and only shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed; deliberate infringement of this law is dangerous play, and results in a penalty kick.\n\nA scrum is a way of restarting the game safely and fairly after a minor infringement. It is awarded when the ball has been knocked or passed forward, if a player takes the ball over his own try line and puts the ball down, when a player is accidentally offside or when the ball is trapped in a ruck or maul with no realistic chance of being retrieved. A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty.\n\nA scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team binding together in three rows. The front row consists of the two props (loosehead and tighthead) either side of the hooker. The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. This formation is known as the 3–4–1 formation. Once a scrum is formed the scrum-half from the team awarded the \"feed\" rolls the ball into the gap between the two front-rows known as the \"tunnel\". The two hookers then compete for possession by hooking the ball backwards with their feet, while each pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards to help gain possession. The side that wins possession transfers the ball to the back of the scrum, where it is picked up either by the number 8 or by the scrum-half.\n\nThere are three match officials: a referee, and two assistant referees. The latter, formerly known as touch judges, had the primary function of indicating when the ball had gone into \"touch\"; their role has been expanded and they are now expected to assist the referee in a number of areas, such as watching for foul play and checking offside lines. In addition, for matches in high level competitions, there is often a television match official (TMO; popularly called the \"video referee\"), to assist with certain decisions, linked up to the referee by radio. The referees have a system of hand signals to indicate their decisions.\n\nCommon offences include tackling above the shoulders, collapsing a scrum, ruck or maul, not releasing the ball when on the ground, or being offside. The non-offending team has a number of options when awarded a penalty: a \"tap\" kick, when the ball is kicked a very short distance from hand, allowing the kicker to regather the ball and run with it; a punt, when the ball is kicked a long distance from hand, for field position; a place-kick, when the kicker will attempt to score a goal; or a scrum. Players may be sent off (signalled by a red card) or temporarily suspended (\"sin-binned\") for ten minutes (yellow card) for foul play or repeated infringements, and may not be replaced.\n\nOccasionally, infringements are not caught by the referee during the match and these may be \"cited\" by the citing commissioner after the match and have punishments (usually suspension for a number of weeks) imposed on the infringing player.\n\nDuring the match, players may be replaced (for injury) or substituted (for tactical reasons). A player who has been replaced may not rejoin play unless he was temporarily replaced to have bleeding controlled; a player who has been substituted may return temporarily, to replace a player who has a blood injury or has suffered a concussion, or permanently, if he is replacing a front-row forward. In international matches, eight replacements are allowed; in domestic or cross-border tournaments, at the discretion of the responsible national union(s), the number of replacements may be nominated to a maximum of eight, of whom three must be sufficiently trained and experienced to provide cover for the three front row positions.\n\nPrior to 2016, all substitutions, no matter the cause, counted against the limit during a match. In 2016, World Rugby changed the law so that substitutions made to replace a player deemed unable to continue due to foul play by the opposition would no longer count against the match limit. This change was introduced in January of that year in the Southern Hemisphere and June in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThe most basic items of equipment for a game of rugby union are the ball itself, a rugby shirt (also known as a \"jersey\"), rugby shorts, socks and boots. The rugby ball is oval in shape, (technically a prolate spheroid), and is made up of four panels. The ball was historically made of leather, but in the modern era most games use a ball made from a synthetic material. The WR lays out specific dimensions for the ball, 280-300mm in length, 740-770mm in circumference of length and 580-620mm in circumference of width. Rugby boots have soles with studs to allow grip on the turf of the pitch. The studs may be either metal or plastic but must not have any sharp edges or ridges.\n\nProtective equipment is optional and strictly regulated. The most common items are mouthguards, which are worn by almost all players, and are compulsory in some rugby-playing nations. Other protective items that are permitted include head gear; thin (not more than 10 mm thick), non-rigid shoulder pads and shin guards; which are worn underneath socks. Bandages or tape can be worn to support or protect injuries; some players wear tape around the head to protect the ears in scrums and rucks. Female players may also wear chest pads. Although not worn for protection, some types of fingerless mitts are allowed to aid grip.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the match officials to check players' clothing and equipment before a game to ensure that it conforms to the laws of the game.\n\nThe international governing body of rugby union (and associated games such as sevens) is World Rugby (WR). The WR headquarters are in Dublin, Ireland. WR, founded in 1886, governs the sport worldwide and publishes the game's laws and rankings. As of February 2014, WR (then known as the IRB, for International Rugby Board) recorded 119 unions in its membership, 101 full members and 18 associate member countries. According to WR, rugby union is played by men and women in over 100 countries. WR controls the Rugby World Cup, the Women's Rugby World Cup, Rugby World Cup Sevens, HSBC Sevens Series, HSBC Women's Sevens Series, World Under 20 Championship, World Under 20 Trophy, Nations Cup and the Pacific Nations Cup. WR holds votes to decide where each of these events are to be held, except in the case of the Sevens World Series for men and women, for which WR contracts with several national unions to hold individual events.\n\nSix regional associations, which are members of WR, form the next level of administration; these are:\n\nSANZAAR (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) is a joint venture of the South African Rugby Union, New Zealand Rugby, Rugby Australia and the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) that operates Super Rugby and The Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri Nations before the entry of Argentina). Although UAR initially had no representation on the former SANZAR board, it was granted input into the organisation's issues, especially with regard to The Rugby Championship, and became a full SANZAAR member in 2016 (when the country entered Super Rugby).\n\nNational unions oversee rugby union within individual countries and are affiliated to WR. Since 2016, the WR Council has 40 seats. A total of 11 unions—the eight foundation unions of Scotland, Ireland, Wales, England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France, plus Argentina, and —have two seats each. In addition, the six regional associations have two seats each. Four more unions—, , and the USA—have one seat each. Finally, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, who usually come from one of the eight foundation unions (although the current Vice Chairman, Agustín Pichot, is with the non-foundation Argentine union) have one vote each.\n\nThe earliest countries to adopt rugby union were England, the country of inception, and the other three Home Nations, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. The spread of rugby union as a global sport has its roots in the exporting of the game by British expatriates, military personnel, and overseas university students.\nThe first rugby club in France was formed by British residents in Le Havre in 1872, while the next year Argentina recorded its first game: 'Banks' v 'City' in Buenos Aires.\n\nAt least seven countries have adopted rugby union as their de facto national sport; they are Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga and Wales.\n\nA rugby club was formed in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in 1864; while the sport was said to have been introduced to New Zealand by Charles Monro in 1870, who played rugby while a student at Christ's College, Finchley.\n\nSeveral island nations have embraced the sport of rugby. Rugby was first played in Fiji circa 1884 by European and Fijian soldiers of the Native Constabulary at Ba on Viti Levu island. Fiji then sent their first overseas team to Samoa in 1924, who in turn set up their own union in 1927. Along with Tonga, other countries to have national rugby teams in Oceania include the Cook Islands, Niue, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands.\n\nIn North America a club formed in Montreal in 1868, Canada's first club. The city of Montreal also played its part in the introduction of the sport in the United States, when students of McGill University played against a team from Harvard University in 1874.\n\nAlthough the exact date of arrival of rugby union in Trinidad and Tobago is unknown, their first club Northern RFC was formed in 1923, a national team was playing by 1927 and due to a cancelled tour to British Guiana in 1933, switched their venue to Barbados; introducing rugby to the island. Other Atlantic countries to play rugby union include Jamaica and Bermuda.\n\nThe growth of rugby union in Europe outside the 6 Nations countries in terms of playing numbers has been sporadic. Historically, British and Irish home teams played the Southern Hemisphere teams of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as France. The rest of Europe were let to play amongst themselves. During a period when it had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France, lacking international competition, became the only European team from the top tier to regularly play the other European countries; mainly Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Romania, Poland, Italy and Czechoslovakia. In 1934, instigated by the French Rugby Federation, FIRA (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the IRFB. The founding members were , , , , , and .\n\nOther European rugby playing nations of note include Russia, whose first officially recorded match is marked by an encounter between Dynamo Moscow and the Moscow Institute of Physical Education in 1933. Rugby union in Portugal also took hold between the First and Second World Wars, with a Portuguese National XV set up in 1922 and an official championship started in 1927.\n\nIn 1999, FIRA agreed to place itself under the auspices of the IRB, transforming itself into a strictly European organising body. Accordingly, it changed its name to FIRA–AER (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur – Association Européenne de Rugby). It adopted its current name of Rugby Europe in 2014.\n\nAlthough Argentina is the best-known rugby playing nation in South America, founding the Argentine Rugby Union in 1899, several other countries on the continent have a long history. Rugby had been played in Brazil since the end of the 19th century, but the game was played regularly only from 1926, when São Paulo beat Santos in an inter-city match. It took Uruguay several aborted attempts to adapt to rugby, led mainly by the efforts of the Montevideo Cricket Club; these efforts succeeded in 1951 with the formation of a national league and four clubs. Other South American countries that formed a rugby union include Chile (1948), and Paraguay (1968).\n\nMany Asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby dating from the British Empire. India began playing rugby in the early 1870s, the Calcutta Football Club forming in 1873. However, with the departure of a local British army regiment, interest in rugby diminished in the area. In 1878, The Calcutta Football Club was disbanded, and rugby in India faltered. Sri Lanka claims to have founded their union in 1878, and although little official information from the period is available, the team won the All-India cup in Madras in 1920. The first recorded match in Malaysia was in 1892, but the first confirmation of rugby is the existence of the \"HMS Malaya Cup\" which was first presented in 1922 and is still awarded to the winners of the Malay sevens.\n\nRugby union was introduced to Japan in 1899 by two Cambridge students: Ginnosuke Tanaka and Edward Bramwell Clarke. The Japan RFU was founded in 1926 and its place in rugby history was cemented with the news that Japan will host the 2019 World Cup. It will be the first country outside the Commonwealth, Ireland and France to host the event, and this is viewed by the IRB as an opportunity for rugby union to extend its reach, particularly in Asia. Other Asian playing countries of note include Singapore, South Korea, China and The Philippines, while the former British colony of Hong Kong is notable within rugby for its development of the rugby sevens game, especially the Hong Kong Sevens tournament which was founded in 1976.\n\nRugby in the Middle East and the Gulf States has its history in the 1950s, with clubs formed by British and French Services stationed in the region after the Second World War. When these servicemen left, the clubs and teams were kept alive by young professionals, mostly Europeans, working in these countries. The official union of Oman was formed in 1971. Bahrain founded its union a year later, while in 1975 the Dubai Sevens, the Gulf's leading rugby tournament, was created. Rugby remains a minority sport in the region with Israel, as of 2011, being the only member union from the Middle East to be included in the IRB World Rankings.\n\nIn 1875, rugby was introduced to South Africa by British soldiers garrisoned in Cape Town. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the sport in Africa was spread by settlers and colonials who often adopted a \"whites-only\" policy to playing the game. This resulted in rugby being viewed as a bourgeois sport by the indigenous people with limited appeal. The earliest countries to see the playing of competitive rugby include South Africa, and neighbouring Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe), which formed the Rhodesia Rugby Football Union in 1895.\n\nIn more recent times the sport has been embraced by several African nations. In the early 21st century Madagascar has experienced crowds of 40,000 at national matches, while Namibia, whose history of rugby can be dated from 1915, have qualified for the final stages of the World Cup four times since 1999. Other African nations to be represented in the World Rugby Rankings as Member Unions include Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia. South Africa and Kenya are among the 15 \"core teams\" that participate in every event of the men's World Rugby Sevens Series.\n\nRecords of women's rugby football date from the late 19th century, with the first documented source being Emily Valentine's writings, stating that she set up a rugby team in Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Ireland in 1887. Although there are reports of early women's matches in New Zealand and France, one of the first notable games to prove primary evidence was the 1917 war-time encounter between Cardiff Ladies and Newport Ladies; a photo of which shows the Cardiff team before the match at the Cardiff Arms Park. In the past 30 years the game has grown in popularity among female athletes, and, according to WR, is now played in over 100 countries.\n\nThe English-based Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU), responsible for women's rugby in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, was founded in 1983, and is the oldest formally organised national governing body for women's rugby. This was replaced in 1994 by the Rugby Football Union for Women (RFUW) in England with each of the other Home Nations governing their own countries. The premier international competition in rugby union for women is the Women's Rugby World Cup, first held in 1991. From 1994 through 2014, it was held every four years. Following the 2014 event, a new four-year cycle was instituted, with the Women's World Cup held in the middle year of the men's World Cup cycle. The new Women's World Cup cycle began in 2017, with future competitions every four years thereafter.\n\nThe most important tournament in rugby union is the Rugby World Cup, a men's tournament that has taken place every four years since 1987 among national rugby union teams. New Zealand has won the Rugby World Cup the most (3 times) and is the current cup holder, winning the 2015 Rugby World Cup held at Twickenham, beating Australia in the final. England (2003) were the first team from the Northern Hemisphere to win, the other champions being New Zealand (1987, 2011 and 2015), Australia (1991 and 1999), and South Africa (1995 and 2007).\n\nThe Rugby World Cup has continued to grow since its inception in 1987. The first tournament, in which 16 teams competed for the title, was broadcast to 17 countries with an accumulated total of 230 million television viewers. Ticket sales during the pool stages and finals of the same tournament was less than a million. The 2007 World Cup was contested by 94 countries with ticket sales of 3,850,000 over the pool and final stage. The accumulated television audience for the event, then broadcast to 200 countries, was a claimed 4.2 billion.\n\nMajor international competitions are the Six Nations Championship and The Rugby Championship, held in Europe and the Southern Hemisphere respectively.\n\nThe Six Nations is an annual competition involving the European teams , , , , and . Each country plays the other five once. After the initial internationals between England and Scotland, Ireland and Wales began competing in the 1880s, forming the \"Home International Championships\". France joined the tournament in the 1900s and in 1910 the term \"Five Nations\" first appeared. However, the Home Nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) excluded France in 1931 amid a run of poor results, allegations of professionalism and concerns over on-field violence. France then rejoined in 1939–1940, though World War II halted proceedings for a further eight years. France has played in all the tournaments since WWII, the first of which was played in 1947. In 2000, Italy became the sixth nation in the contest and Rome's Stadio Olimpico has replaced Stadio Flaminio, as the venue for their home games since 2013. The current Six Nations champions are Ireland.\n\nThe Rugby Championship is the Southern Hemisphere's annual international series for that region's top national teams. From its inception in 1996 through 2011, it was known as the Tri Nations, as it featured the hemisphere's traditional powers of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. These teams have dominated world rankings in recent years, and many considered the Tri Nations to be the toughest competition in international rugby. The Tri Nations was initially played on a home and away basis with the three nations playing each other twice.\n\nIn 2006 a new system was introduced where each nation plays the others three times, though in 2007 and 2011 the teams played each other only twice, as both were World Cup years. Since Argentina's strong performances in the 2007 World Cup, after the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, SANZAR (South Africa, New Zealand and Australian Rugby) invited the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) to join an expanded Four Nations tournament in 2012. The competition has been officially rechristened as The Rugby Championship beginning with the 2012 edition. The competition reverted to the Tri Nations' original home-and-away format, but now involving four teams. In World Cup years, an abbreviated tournament is held in which each team plays the others only once. New Zealand are the current champions, having won the 2018 title with a round to spare.\n\nRugby union was played at the Olympic Games in 1900, 1908, 1920 and 1924. As per Olympic rules, the nations of Scotland, Wales and England were not allowed to play separately as they are not sovereign states. In 1900, France won the gold, beating Great Britain 27 points to 8 and defeating Germany 27 points to 17. In 1908, Australia defeated Great Britain, claiming the gold medal, the score being 32 points to three. In 1920, the United States, fielding a team with many players new to the sport of rugby, upset France in a shock win, eight points to zero. In 1924, the United States again defeated France 17 to 3, becoming the only team to win gold twice in the sport.\n\nIn 2009 the International Olympic Committee voted with a majority of 81 to 8 that rugby union be reinstated as an Olympic sport in at least the 2016 and 2020 games, but in the sevens, 4-day tournament format. This is something the rugby world has aspired to for a long time and Bernard Lapasset, president of the International Rugby Board, said the Olympic gold medal would be considered to be \"the pinnacle of our sport\" (Rugby Sevens).\n\nRugby sevens has been played at the Commonwealth Games since the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur. The most gold medal holders are New Zealand who have won the competition on four successive occasions until South Africa beat them in 2014. Rugby union has also been an Asian Games event since the 1998 games in Bangkok, Thailand. In the 1998 and 2002 editions of the games, both the usual fifteen-a-side variety and rugby sevens were played, but from 2006 onwards, only rugby sevens was retained. In 2010, the women's rugby sevens event was introduced. The event is likely to remain a permanent fixture of the Asian Games due to elevation of rugby sevens as an Olympic sport from the 2016 Olympics onwards. The present gold medal holders in the sevens tournament, held in 2014, are Japan in the men's event and China in the women's.\n\nWomen's international rugby union began in 1982, with a match between France and the Netherlands played in Utrecht. As of 2009 over six hundred women's internationals have been played by over forty different nations.\n\nThe first Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Wales in 1991, and was won by the United States. The second tournament took place in 1994, and from that time through 2014 was held every four years. The New Zealand Women's team then won four straight World Cups (1998, 2002, 2006, 2010) before England won in 2014. Following the 2014 event, World Rugby moved the next edition of the event to 2017, with a new four-year cycle from that point forward. New Zealand are the current World Cup holders.\n\nAs well as the Women's Rugby World Cup there are also other regular tournaments, including a Six Nations, run in parallel to the men's competition. The Women's Six Nations, first played in 1996 has been dominated by England, who have won the tournament on 14 occasions, including a run of seven consecutive wins from 2006 to 2012. However, since then, England have won only in 2017; reigning champion France have won in each even-numbered year (2014, 2016, 2018) whilst Ireland won in 2013 and 2015.\n\nRugby union has been professionalized since 1995. The following table shows fully professional rugby competitions. (Semi-professional competitions are excluded.)\n\nThe game of rugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 15-a-side code. The two more common differences applied to the variants of the sport lie in either fewer players or reduced player contact. Of the variants, the oldest is Rugby sevens (7's, or VIIs), a fast-paced variant which originated in Melrose, Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes.\n\nMajor tournaments include the Hong Kong Sevens and Dubai Sevens, both held in areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side game. A more recent variant of the sport is Rugby tens (10's or Xs), a Malaysian variant with ten players per side.\n\nDue to the physical nature of playing rugby, several variants have been created to introduce the sport to children with a reduced level of physical contact. Of these versions, Touch rugby, in which \"tackles\" are made by simply touching the ball carrier with two hands, is popular as a mixed sex version of the sport played by both children and adults. Tag Rugby, is a version in which the participants wear a belt with two hook-and-loop fastener tags, the removal of either counting as a 'tackle'. Tag Rugby also varies in the fact that kicking the ball is not allowed.\n\nMini rugby is another variant of rugby union aimed at fostering the sport in children. It is played with only eight players and on a smaller pitch. Similar to Tag Rugby, American Flag Rugby, (AFR), is a mixed gender, non-contact imitation of rugby union designed for American children entering grades K-9. Both American Flag Rugby and Mini Rugby differ to Tag Rugby in that they introduce more advanced elements of rugby union as the participants age.\n\nOther less formal variants include beach rugby and snow rugby.\n\nRugby league was formed as an administrative break from the English union before changing its laws, becoming a code in its own right. The two sports continue to influence each other to this day.\n\nAmerican football and Canadian football are derived from early forms of rugby.\n\nAustralian rules football was influenced by rugby football and other games originating in English public schools.\n\nJames Naismith took aspects of many sports including rugby to invent basketball. The most obvious contribution is the jump ball's similarity to the line-out as well as the underhand shooting style that dominated the early years of the sport. Naismith played rugby at McGill University.\n\nSwedish football was a code whose rules were a mix of Association and Rugby football rules.\n\nRugby lends its name to wheelchair rugby, a full-contact sport which contains elements of rugby such as crossing a try line with the ball to score.\n\nAccording to a 2011 report by the Centre for the International Business of Sport, over four and a half million people play rugby union or one of its variants organised by the IRB. This is an increase of 19 percent since the previous report in 2007. The report also claimed that since 2007 participation has grown by 33 percent in Africa, 22 percent in South America and 18 percent in Asia and North America. In 2014 the IRB published a breakdown of the total number of players worldwide by national unions. It recorded a total of 6.6 million players globally, of those, 2.36 million were registered members playing for a club affiliated to their country's union. The 2016 World Rugby Year in Review reported 8.5 million players, of which 3.2 million were registered union players and 1.9 million were registered club players; 22% of all players were female.\n\nThe most capped international player from the tier 1 nations is former New Zealand openside flanker and captain Richie McCaw who has played in 148 internationals. While the top scoring tier 1 international player is New Zealand's Dan Carter, who has amassed 1442 points during his career. In April 2010 Lithuania which is a second tier rugby nation, broke the record of consecutive international wins for second tier rugby nations. In 2016, the All Blacks of New Zealand set the new record 18 consecutive test wins among tier 1 rugby nations, bettering their previous consecutive run of 17. This record was equalled by England on 11 March 2017 with a win over Scotland at Twickenham. The highest scoring international match between two recognised unions was Hong Kong's 164–13 victory over Singapore on 27 October 1994. While the largest winning margin of 152 points is held by two countries, Japan (a 155–3 win over Chinese Taipei) and Argentina (152–0 over Paraguay) both in 2002.\n\nThe record attendance for a rugby union game was set on 15 July 2000 in which New Zealand defeated Australia 39–35 in a Bledisloe Cup game at Stadium Australia in Sydney before 109,874 fans. The record attendance for a match in Europe of 104,000 (at the time a world record) was set on 1 March 1975 when Scotland defeated Wales 12–10 at Murrayfield in Edinburgh during the 1975 Five Nations Championship. The record attendance for a domestic club match is 99,124, set when Racing 92 defeated Toulon in the 2016 Top 14 final on 24 June at Camp Nou in Barcelona. The match had been moved from its normal site of Stade de France near Paris due to scheduling conflicts with France's hosting of UEFA Euro 2016.\n\nThomas Hughes 1857 novel \"Tom Brown's Schooldays\", set at Rugby School, includes a rugby football match, also portrayed in the 1940s film of the same name. James Joyce mentions Irish team Bective Rangers in several of his works, including Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939), while his 1916 semi-autobiographical work \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" has an account of Ireland international James Magee. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his 1924 Sherlock Holmes tale \"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\", mentions that Dr Watson played rugby for Blackheath.\n\nHenri Rousseau's 1908 work \"Joueurs de football\" shows two pairs of rugby players competing. Other French artists to have represented the sport in their works include Albert Gleizes' \"Les Joueurs de football\" (1912), Robert Delaunay's \"Football. L'Équipe de Cardiff\" (1916) and André Lhote's \"Partie de Rugby\" (1917). The 1928 Gold Medal for Art at the Antwerp Olympics was won by Luxembourg's Jean Jacoby for his work \"Rugby\".\n\nIn film, Ealing Studios' 1949 comedy \"A Run for Your Money\" and the 1979 BBC Wales television film \"Grand Slam\" both centre on fans attending a match. Films that explore the sport in more detail include independent production \"Old Scores\" (1991) and \"Forever Strong\" (2008). \"Invictus\" (2009), based on John Carlin's book \"Playing the Enemy\", explores the events of the 1995 Rugby World Cup and Nelson Mandela's attempt to use the sport to connect South Africa's people post-apartheid.\n\nIn public art and sculpture there are many works dedicated to the sport. There is a 27 ft bronze statue of a rugby line-out by pop artist Gerald Laing at Twickenham and one of rugby administrator Sir Tasker Watkins at the Millennium Stadium. Rugby players to have been honoured with statues include Gareth Edwards in Cardiff and Danie Craven in Stellenbosch.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the home field of the Houston Cougars baseball team. Several iterations of the ballpark have existed. The current stadium holds 5,000 people, and opened for baseball in 1995. With a 1,500 square foot Daktronics video board, Schroeder Park features the second-largest scoreboard in college baseball. Since its opening, Schroeder Park has hosted several notable college baseball events. In February 2016, the University of Houston announced that, as a response to a large donation to the baseball program, Cougar Field would be renamed Darryl & Lori Schroeder Park. \n\nPrior to 1961, the Cougars played at Buff Stadium. The original baseball stadium named Cougar Field was built roughly in the same area as the current one. Before 1968, it existed where Hofheinz Pavilion is today. To make room for the then new basketball arena, Cougar Field was moved next door. This iteration of Cougar Field stayed in the same location until March 29, 1994 when it was demolished in preparation for the establishment of the UH Athletics/Alumni center. To finish the rest of their season's home games, the Cougars played at Texas A&M University's Olsen Field and crosstown Rice University's Cameron Field. After a multimillion dollar donation from Cougar alumnus and San Diego Padres owner John Moores, the current stadium was built throughout the remainder of the year, and had its first game on February 22, 1995. \n\nIn late 2013, Houston, citing national competitiveness in recruiting, changed Schroeder Park's playing surface from natural grass to artificial turf. In September 2015, Houston announced a new 20,000 square foot clubhouse and player development center to be constructed for Schroeder Park. In October 2015, a new Daktronics video board with 1,500 square feet of space replaced the original one, and Schroeder Park became host to the largest scoreboard in college baseball.\n\nSince its opening in 1995, Schroeder Park has hosted several notable college baseball events. In, 1999, 2000,2015, and 2017 an NCAA Regional was hosted at the ball park. Also in 2000, Schroeder Park was home to an NCAA Super Regional. In addition, the 2004 and 2010 Conference USA Baseball Tournaments were both hosted at the ballpark.\n\nIn 2014, the USA Baseball 18U National Team held trials at the ballpark.\n\nSchroeder Park is a scaled-down version of a major league ballpark. Until October 2015, it featured a scoreboard with a Philips Vidiwall LED video screen constructed by Spectrum Corporation. It was replaced by a Daktronics video board, known as the \"Sanders-Gutierrez Scoreboard\", which is the second-largest in college baseball (behind only Arkansas' Baum Stadium). Schroeder Park seats up to 5,000 spectators, with most of the seats covered by a canopy roof. \n\nFor players, in addition to locker rooms, there are facilities for indoor batting practice, storage, and laundry. Schroeder Park's press box seats 28, and has booths for television and radio coverage. The field is made of artificial turf, which can increase the running speed, but can also increase injuries as compared to natural grass.\n\nIn 2010, the Cougars ranked 45th among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 1,262 per home game.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52568999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52568999", "title": "Scoring in association football", "text": "Scoring in association football\n\nIn games of association football teams compete to score the most goals during the match. A goal is scored when the ball passes completely over a goal line at each end of the field of play between two centrally positioned upright goal posts 24 feet (7.32 m) apart and underneath a horizontal crossbar at a height of 8 feet (2.44 m) — this frame is also referred to as a goal. Each team aims to score at one end of the pitch, while also preventing their opponents scoring at the other. Nets are usually attached to the goal frame to catch goalscoring balls.\n\nRules concerning goal scoring are described in Law 10 of the Laws of the Game:\n\nAs with other cases of the ball travelling out of the field of play, all of the ball must cross all of the line, otherwise play continues. A goal is credited to the team attacking the goal scored upon, regardless of which team actually caused the ball to enter the goal. A ball entering a goal from the action of a player defending that goal is called an own goal. \n\nEven if serious foul play unambiguously prevents scoring a goal (a professional foul), a referee cannot award a goal if it does not enter the goal as described above; i.e., there is no provision for awarding a goal akin to the penalty try in rugby football or the goaltending offence in basketball.\n\nA goal cannot be scored directly from an indirect free kick or a throw-in. Should the ball go into the goal from these without first being touched by another player, play is restarted with a goal kick. A player cannot score an own goal directly from \"any\" restart of play, in that case a corner kick would be awarded. Both of these situations, especially the latter, are exceedingly rare.\n\nIf there is time remaining in the session of play, after a goal has been scored play is restarted with a kick-off by the side which conceded the goal.\n\nMost goals are relatively unambiguous, as the ball will usually strike the net attached to the goal structure indicating that it passed the goal line as described above. Occasionally, however, situations occur where it is difficult for officials to tell if the ball completely crossed the goal line before a rebound, save, or clearance from the goal area. Additionally, even if the ball crosses the goal line as required, a goal may be disallowed if the attacking team commits an infringement of the Laws of the Game, such as the offside offence or a foul. \n\nAs with all other decisions on the Laws of the Game, the referee is the final authority as to whether a goal is scored or disallowed. The match referee is advised by assistant referees, whose view across the pitch from the sidelines may in some cases be more useful in determining whether the ball crossed the goal line or whether the attacking team committed an infringement. \n\nThe goal net was one of the earliest tools employed to aid match officials in determining whether a goal was scored. Introduced in the 1890s, the goal net provides a simple way to determine whether the ball passed on the correct side of the goal posts and crossbar. Although not mandated by the Laws of the Game, goal nets are now ubiquitous across most levels of organised football. Since 2012, goal-line technology has been used at the highest levels of professional football; it employs a system of cameras and sensors to provide the referee with a discreet signal when the ball has crossed the goal line. The video assistant referee was added in 2018 after years of trials; this is an additional assistant referee who constantly monitors video footage of the match and is empowered to advise the referee if he/she may have made a clear error in awarding a goal.\n\nThe Laws make no mention of attributing goals to individual players. Nevertheless, goals are almost always attributed to individual players, that player being the one who provided the final action causing the goal to be scored. Generally, this is the last player to touch the ball, notwithstanding inconsequential deflections such as failed attempts at a save. Should a player cause a goal to be scored against their own team, the goal is recorded as an own goal.\n\nThe authority on attributing goals varies between competitions. The Premier League in England has a dedicated Dubious Goals Committee for resolving attribution disputes.\n\nFor an individual player, scoring multiple goals in a game is considered a notable achievement. In association football, a hat-trick refers to the uncommon feat of scoring three goals in a single game. Awards exist for individual players who score the most goals in some competitions, such awards are often called the \"Golden Boot\".\n\nPlayers will typically celebrate scoring a goal with team mates, occasionally putting on elaborate displays for the crowd. The Laws allow this, but mandate that celebration must not be \"excessive\".\n\nOn average, only a few scores occur per game in association football.\n\nAn analysis of several years' results from several English leagues found that 1–0 was the most common result, occurring in approximately 20% of games.\n"}

{"id": "2748329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2748329", "title": "State Farm Stadium", "text": "State Farm Stadium\n\nState Farm Stadium, formerly known as University of Phoenix Stadium, is a multi-purpose football stadium located in Glendale, Arizona, west of Phoenix. It is the home of the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) and the annual Fiesta Bowl. It replaced Tempe's Sun Devil Stadium as the Valley of the Sun's main stadium. The stadium is adjacent to the Gila River Arena and it features the first fully retractable natural grass playing surface built in the United States on top of an AirField Systems drainage system. An opening on one side of the stadium allows the playing field to move to the exterior of the building, allowing the entire natural turf playing surface to be exposed to daylight and also allowing the floor of the stadium to be used for any other purpose (such as seating for concerts or to accommodate motorsports events) without damaging the turf.\n\nThe stadium has hosted the Fiesta Bowl, the 2007 BCS National Championship Game, 2011 BCS National Championship Game and 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, which set the venue's entertainment attendance record of 78,603 on January 11, 2011, 2008 Super Bowl XLII, 2015 Super Bowl XLIX, 2023 Super Bowl LVII, the 2015 Pro Bowl, WrestleMania XXVI, and matches from the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup. It was one of the stadiums for the Copa América Centenario in 2016, with one of those matches being the 3rd place final. It hosted the NCAA Final Four in 2017 and will do so again in 2024.\n\nThe University of Phoenix acquired the naming rights in September 2006, shortly after the stadium had opened under the name Cardinals Stadium and retained the rights until September 2018. The \"University of Phoenix\" name was applied as a corporate sponsor, and not as the home stadium of the university, which has no intercollegiate athletics program (the university is a private, for-profit venture).\n\nOn September 4, 2018, State Farm acquired the naming rights. The Cardinals and State Farm reached agreement on an 18-year commitment that resulted in the team’s home venue becoming State Farm Stadium.\n\nSince moving to Arizona from St. Louis, Missouri in 1988, the Cardinals had played at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University. The Cardinals had only planned to play there until a new stadium could be built in Phoenix. However, the savings and loan crisis derailed funding for a new stadium during the 1990s. Over time, the Cardinals expressed frustration at being merely tenants in a college football stadium. The lack of having their own stadium denied them additional revenue streams available to other NFL teams. The Cardinals campaigned several years in the years prior to its construction for a new and more modern facility.\n\nThe ceremonial groundbreaking for the new stadium was held on April 12, 2003, and the 63,400-seat stadium opened on August 1, 2006 after three years of construction. The stadium was designed by Eisenman Architects and HOK Sport (now Populous). The stadium is considered an architectural icon for the region and was named by \"Business Week\" as one of the 10 “most impressive” sports facilities on the globe due to the combination of its retractable roof (engineering design by Walter P Moore) and roll-in natural grass field, similar to the GelreDome and the Veltins-Arena.\n\nLED video and ribbon displays from Daktronics in Brookings, South Dakota were installed in 2006 prior to Arizona's first game of the season at the new stadium.\n\nThe cost of the project was $455 million. That total included $395.4 million for the stadium, $41.7 million for site improvements, and $17.8 million for the land. Contributors to the stadium included the Arizona Sports and Tourism Authority ($302.3 million), the Arizona Cardinals ($143.2 million), and the City of Glendale ($9.5 million).\n\nThe stadium has 88 luxury suites — called luxury lofts — with space for 16 future suites as the stadium matures.\n\nThe surrounding the stadium is called Sportsman's Park. Included within the Park is an landscaped tailgating area called the Great Lawn.\n\nThere are no obstructed view seats in the stadium. There are visible areas in the upper deck of the end zone where seats could have been put in but were not due to the giant super columns supporting the roof structure.\nThe stadium seating capacity can be expanded by 8,800 for \"mega-events\" such as college bowls, NFL Super Bowls, and the NFC Championship Game by adding risers and ganged, portable \"X-frame\" folding seats. The endzone area on the side of the facility where the field tray rolls in and out of the facility can be expanded to accommodate the additional seats.\n\nThe roof is made out of translucent Birdair fabric and opens in 12 minutes. It is the first retractable roof ever built on an incline.\n\nEvents held at the stadium include Arizona Cardinals home games; public grand opening tours held August 19 and 20, 2006 (attended by 120,000 people); various shows, expositions, tradeshows and motor sport events; the AIA 4A and 5A state championship games for football; and international soccer exhibition matches.\n\nThe multipurpose nature of the facility has allowed it to host 91 events representing 110 event days between the dates of August 4, 2006 through the BCS National Championship January 8, 2007.\n\nThe first preseason football game was played August 12, 2006 when the Cardinals defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers, 21–13. The first regular season game was played September 10 against the San Francisco 49ers (the Cardinals won 34–27). The stadium's air-conditioning system made it possible for the Cardinals to play at home on the opening weekend of the NFL season for the first time since moving to Arizona in 1988.\n\nOn October 16, 2006, the stadium hosted a notable game between the Cardinals and the undefeated Chicago Bears where the Bears came back from a 20-point deficit to defeat the Cardinals. The Bears would later go on to play in Super Bowl XLI.\n\nUniversity of Phoenix Stadium hosted Super Bowl XLII on February 3, 2008 in which the New York Giants defeated the previously undefeated New England Patriots 17–14 with a paid attendance crowd of 71,101. This was the second time the Phoenix area hosted a Super Bowl, the other being Super Bowl XXX held in nearby Tempe at Sun Devil Stadium in 1996 when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThe Cardinals' first home playoff game since 1947 took place at the stadium on January 3, 2009, with Arizona beating the Atlanta Falcons, 30–24. The stadium also hosted the between the Cardinals and Philadelphia Eagles on January 18, 2009, which the Cardinals won 32–25 in front of over 70,000 fans in attendance.\n\nThe 2015 Pro Bowl was the first Pro Bowl to be held at the same location as the same year's Super Bowl since 2010. The Pro Bowl returned to Hawaii in 2016. On February 1, 2015, the New England Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX held at the stadium.\n\nThe stadium was the venue for the Fiesta Bowl on January 1, 2007 featuring the Boise State Broncos vs. the University of Oklahoma Sooners (Boise State won 43-42 in overtime); and the BCS National Championship on January 8, 2007 between the (1) Ohio State Buckeyes and the (2) University of Florida Gators, which the Gators won 41-14.\n\nIt also hosted the 2008 Fiesta Bowl between the Oklahoma Sooners and the West Virginia University Mountaineers, as well as the 2009 Fiesta Bowl between the Texas Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes. It has also held many high school graduations.\n\nOn January 10, 2011, the 2011 BCS National Championship Game between the Auburn Tigers and the Oregon Ducks had an attendance record setting 78,603 on hand for the game.\n\nOn January 11, 2016, University of Phoenix Stadium hosted the College Football Playoff National Championship Game featuring No. 2 ranked Alabama Crimson Tide and No. 1 ranked Clemson Tigers.\n\nBefore 2018 the venue was known as University of Phoenix Stadium. It hosted the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship in 2017. State Farm Stadium will host the Final Four in 2024.\n\nOn February 7, 2007, the stadium hosted a soccer match attended by 62,462 fans. The United States men's national soccer team defeated Mexico, 2–0. On January 21, 2012, the U.S. played against Venezuela and won the match 1–0.\n\nOn January 30, 2013, Mexico played against Denmark, a game that was broadcast on Televisa Deportes, UniMás, and TV Azteca. The match ended in a 1–1 draw.\n\nOn November 19, 2015, the stadium was one of the sites selected for the 2016 Copa América Centenario. The stadium hosted three matches, including Mexico vs. Uruguay on June 5, and the third-place match (United States vs. Colombia) on June 25.\n\nIn club soccer, Real Madrid battled MLS side LA Galaxy in August 2013. The Spanish side defeated the Galaxy 3–1.\n\nThe stadium hosted the WWE event WrestleMania XXVI with 72,219 fans in attendance. The event was held in the stadium on March 28, 2010. WrestleMania XXVI was the twenty-sixth annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on March 28, 2010, at the venue when it was known as University of Phoenix Stadium in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, Arizona. This was the first WrestleMania since WrestleMania XI with a non-title match as a main event, the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Arizona and the third to be held in an open-air venue, after WrestleMania IX and WrestleMania XXIV. WrestleMania XXVI was a joint-promotion event, with performers both from the Raw and SmackDown brands. The event's card consisted of eight matches, including three main matches. The first of these matches was a no disqualification, no count-out match, in which The Undertaker defeated Shawn Michaels to improve his undefeated WrestleMania streak to 18–0. Per the pre-match stipulation, Michaels was forced to retire. The second was a singles match for the WWE Championship that saw John Cena defeat Batista to win the championship. The third saw World Heavyweight Champion, Chris Jericho, defeat Edge to retain the title. The undercard also included a No Holds Barred match between Bret Hart and Mr. McMahon and the sixth annual Money in the Bank ladder match. Tickets for the event commenced sale to the public on November 7, 2009. WrestleMania XXVI generated approximately 885,000 PPV buys, grossing US$49 million in revenue. With an attendance of 72,219, the event grossed $5.8 million in ticket sales, making the event the highest grossing and attended entertainment event held at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nOther events included the Fiesta Bowl National Band Championship High School Marching Band competition. It has also held many high school graduations. \n\nOn August 1, 2009, the stadium hosted Monster Jam Summer Heat, with Maximum Destruction defeating Captain's Curse in the racing finals and Grave Digger winning the freestyle event.\n\nThe stadium hosted the inaugural Stadium Super Trucks race on April 6, 2013.\n\nOn January 30, 2016, Monster Jam returned to the stadium for the first time since 2009, with 16 of the best trucks. On February 6, the AMA Supercross Championship raced for the first time, after visiting Chase Field from 1999 to 2015.\n\nOn September 26, 2006 the University of Phoenix acquired the naming rights to the stadium totalling $154.5 million over 20 years. On April 11, 2017, the University of Phoenix terminated the naming rights just 11 years into the 20-year deal, citing financial woes; however, the university kept its name on the stadium until a replacement company was found to give naming rights to. On September 4th, 2018, State Farm reached a deal securing the rights through 2036. University of Phoenix will remain involved as a sponsor with the team in a reduced capacity as the Cardinals' \"official education partner.\"\n\nThe stadium has approximately 14,000 on-site parking spaces (plus 12,000 adjacent spaces), located in numerous lots that surround the stadium's 2,000 disabled parking spaces. The design improvement, featured for example in a Discovery program about this stadium, is zoning. Parking spaces for guests are zoned with preferred leaving directions, to achieve the fastest possible movement of traffic.\n\n"}
{"id": "608992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=608992", "title": "Tarpaulin", "text": "Tarpaulin\n\nA tarpaulin ( , ), or tarp, is a large sheet of strong, flexible, water-resistant or waterproof material, often cloth such as canvas or polyester coated with polyurethane, or made of plastics such as polyethylene. In some places such as Australia, and in military slang, a tarp may be known as a hootch. Tarpaulins often have reinforced grommets at the corners and along the sides to form attachment points for rope, allowing them to be tied down or suspended.\n\nInexpensive modern tarpaulins are made from woven polyethylene; this material is so associated with tarpaulins that it has become colloquially known in some quarters as polytarp.\n\nThe word \"tarpaulin\" originated as a compound of the words \"tar\" and \"palling\", referring to a tarred canvas pall used to cover objects on ships. Sailors often tarred their own overclothes in the same manner as the sheets or palls. By association, sailors became known as \"jack tars\".\n\nIn the mid-19th century, \"paulin\" was used for such a cloth; here General Rosecrans tells a subordinate how to improvise a boat:\n\n\"A boat has been ordered up, but to make sure a large paulin will be sent down to you, with which, spread under a lot of wagon-beds, you will be able to make a large scow.\"\n\n\"Two wagon beds ... were placed upon frames ... Thus constructed, they were placed upon a duck paulin, which was drawn up tightly around the beds and secured.\"\n\nTarpaulins have multiple uses, including as shelter from the elements, i.e., wind, rain, or sunlight, a ground sheet. Tarpaulins are often used during the build process to protect brickwork and masonry from weather damage. Tarpaulins are also used for a fly in camping, a drop sheet for painting, for protecting the infield of a baseball field, and for protecting objects, such as unenclosed trucks, semi-trailers or freight cars as well as wood piles. Such was the demand for tarpaulins by the New South Wales Government Railways, up until 1990, they operated their own tarpaulin factory. It is also used on outdoor market stalls to provide some protection from the elements of nature.\nTarpaulins are also used for advertisement printing, most notably for billboards.\n\nAnother historical use of a tarpaulin is to cover seats in a stadium that are rarely used, are in venues oversized for a venue, or are obstructed view seats in a multi-purpose stadium or indoor arena for a certain sport. The entire third deck of the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum is also covered in tarp for Oakland Athletics games, but is uncovered for Oakland Raiders games, while portions of the upper deck CenturyLink Field in Seattle are covered with images of the Seattle Sounders FC crest or sponsor logos in games which do not require use of that seating.\n\nPerforated tarpaulins are typically used for medium to large advertising, or for protection on scaffoldings, the aim of the perforations (from 20% to 70%) is to reduce wind vulnerability. \nPolyethylene tarpaulins have also proven to be a popular source when an inexpensive, water resistant fabric is needed. Many amateur builders of plywood sailboats turn to polyethylene tarpaulins for making their sails, as it is inexpensive and easily worked. With the proper type of adhesive tape, it is possible to make a serviceable sail for a small boat with no sewing.\n\nPlastic tarps are sometimes used as a building material in communities of indigenous North Americans. Tipis made with tarps are known as tarpees.\n\nTarpaulins can be classified based on a diversity of factors, such as material type (polyethylene, canvas, vinyl, etc.), thickness, which is generally measured in mils or generalized into categories (such as \"regular duty\", \"heavy duty\", \"super heavy duty\", etc.), and grommet strength (simple vs. reinforced), among others.\n\nTarpaulins can also be classified by size—a common determining factor for consumers in acquiring tarps—and measured in width by length. Actual tarp sizes are generally about three to five percent smaller than the advertised size. (Thus, a tarp advertised as will actually measure about .) Some other factors that may influence a purchase decision include color (often they come in blue, green, black, or silver), grommet type (aluminum, stainless steel, etc.), and grommet-to-grommet distance (these often run between and ). The weave count, a measure of tarp strength, often runs between (8 and 12 per square inch) and the greater the count, the greater its resistance against ripping in high wind conditions. Tarps may also be washable or non-washable and waterproof or non-waterproof, and mildewproof vs. non-mildewproof. Tarp flexibility refers to its ability to remain pliable during cold winter months; some tarps offer more flexibility than others in cold weather. Some manufacturers also advertise their tarps as \"rot-proof\", but this may be more a subjective than an objective measurement.\n\nA polyethylene tarpaulin (\"polytarp\") is not a traditional fabric, but rather, a laminate of woven and sheet material. The center is loosely woven from strips of polyethylene plastic, with sheets of the same material bonded to the surface. This creates a fabric-like material that resists stretching well in all directions and is waterproof. Sheets can be either of low density polyethylene (LDPE) or high density polyethylene (HDPE). When treated against ultraviolet light, these tarpaulins can last for years exposed to the elements, but non-UV treated material will quickly become brittle and lose strength and water resistance if exposed to sunlight.\n\nCanvas tarpaulins are not 100% waterproof, though they are water resistant. Thus, while a little bit of water for a short period of time will not affect them, when there is standing water on canvas tarps, or when water cannot quickly drain away from canvas tarps, the standing water will drip through this type of tarp.\n\nPolyvinyl chloride (\"vinyl\") tarpaulins are industrial-grade and intended for heavy-duty use. They are constructed of coated yellow vinyl. This makes it waterproof and have high abrasion resistance and tear strength. These resist oil, acid, grease and mildew. The vinyl tarp is ideal for agriculture, construction, industrial and trucks.\n\nTarp tents may be made of silnylon.\n\nFor years manufacturers have used a color code to indicate the grade of tarpaulins, but not all manufacturers follow this traditional method of grading. Following this color-coded system, blue indicates a lightweight tarp, and typically has a weave count of 8×8 and a thickness of . Silver is a heavy-duty tarp and typically has a weave count of 14×14 and a thickness of .\n\nSome of the more common colors in that scheme are:\n\nTarps have been used both within works of art, and also to conceal works of art from public view.\n\nA 2017 work called \"Tarp\" by Amy Malbeuf consists of a blue tarp with the word \"tarp\" written on it in glass beads. The work was created in reference to the use of tarps in improvised shelters by people who are homeless in Oakland, California.\n\nNative American artist Nicholas Galanin's 2018 retrospective art show \"Dear Listener\" at the Heard Museum included tarps as both elements of sculpture and as part of the gallery presentation. The sculpture \"Creation with Her Children\", a collaboration between Galanin and Merritt Johnson, depicts Creation clothed in a gown made from a blue plastic tarp. While Creation carves her own face, her children, depicted as animals who have human hands, are gathered near her feet. According to the gallery text and the printed program, the tarp, which is \"used heavily in indigenous communities,\" references \"contemporary Indigenous life and the long standing effects of forced relocation under colonial rule.\"\n\nIn one of the galleries housing \"Dear Listener,\" the skylights have been covered with blue tarps. The decision to do so \nwas made by a museum curator in reference to the use of tarps in Indigenous North America as an inexpensive and widely available material used for building and repair. It also casts a blue glow on the room, and creates \"a reminder that we live in a borrowed landscape, under artificial light and in air-conditioned spaces.\"\n\nTarps have also been used to conceal art from public view, including statues of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, an illegally placed bust of Edward Snowden, a fiberglass casting couch in a Hollywood mall that took on new meaning after sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein in 2017, and a sculpture of the founder of Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\n"}
{"id": "6031338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6031338", "title": "Tuck rule (American football)", "text": "Tuck rule (American football)\n\nThe tuck rule was a controversial rule in American football used by the National Football League from 1999 until 2013. It stated:\n\nNFL Rule 3, Section 22, Article 2, Note 2. When [an offensive] player is holding the ball to pass it forward, any intentional forward movement of his arm starts a forward pass, even if the player loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body. Also, if the player has tucked the ball into his body and then loses possession, it is a fumble. \n\nIf the quarterback drops or loses the football while he is bringing the ball forward in a passing motion, and the ball touches the ground, it is considered an incomplete pass. If the quarterback drops or loses the football at any other time, it is considered a fumble, as if any other player had dropped it.\n\nIt is referred to as the tuck rule because the ball leaving the quarterback's hands is considered a forward pass even if the quarterback intends not to pass the ball, but instead continues the forward motion to tuck the ball back into his body. Only once the forward motion of the arm is completed, and the ball tucked into the quarterback's body, would a subsequent loss of possession be considered a fumble.\n\nMike Pereira, the former director of officiating of the NFL, noted that the design of the rule avoids the question of the quarterback's intent, except that the referee still must judge whether the initial forward movement of the arm was \"intentional.\"\n\nThe tuck rule was called in Week 2 of an NFL regular season matchup on September 23, 2001, between the New England Patriots and the New York Jets. With 1:01 left in the second quarter, Patriots defensive end Anthony Pleasant apparently forced Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde to fumble the ball, with Patriots defensive end Richard Seymour making a recovery. The call was overturned upon review and ruled an incomplete pass, with the tuck rule cited. The Jets tied the game with a field goal on that drive before going on to win 10-3. This was also the game in which Jets linebacker Mo Lewis hit Patriots starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe during the fourth quarter of the game. Bledsoe was replaced with second year backup Tom Brady for the rest of the season. Bledsoe came in to replace Brady in the 2001 AFC Championship Game against the Steelers after Brady got hit on his ankle. The Pats went on to win 24-17 and then beat the heavily-favored Rams 20-17 in Super Bowl XXXVI.\n\nPatriots head coach Bill Belichick referred to this game after the subsequent Tuck Rule Game, telling ESPN, \"I knew what the ruling should have been because we had dealt with that play a little bit earlier in the year on the other side of it.\"\n\nThe tuck rule resulted in a controversial finish to an AFC divisional playoff game on January 19, 2002, between the New England Patriots and the Oakland Raiders.\n\nIn the closing moments of the fourth quarter of the game in a snowy Foxboro Stadium, with New England trailing by three points, New England quarterback Tom Brady dropped back to pass. After he had begun a passing motion, Brady apparently ceased his throwing motion, pulled his right hand down below his shoulder and had touched the ball to his left hand when, coming off the strong side corner blitz, Charles Woodson knocked the ball out of Brady's hands. Raiders middle linebacker Greg Biekert then fell on the loose football. The officials initially called the play a recovered fumble, which would have sealed the victory for the Raiders. But after instant replay, referee Walt Coleman reversed this call, declared the play an incomplete forward pass, and gave possession back to New England. In explaining the reversal to the audience, Coleman stated that the ball was moving forward at the time it was dropped. In later interviews, Coleman stated that it was his explanation, not the reversal, that was in error; the ball was moving backwards when it was lost, but the tuck rule applied. Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri later tied the game with a 45-yard field goal; in overtime, the Patriots defeated the Raiders on another field goal. Two games later, the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI.\n\nThe NFL defended the call, but Bruce Allen, who ran the front office for the Raiders at the time of the game, said, \"The rule itself doesn't bother me, but the way the rule is written, it was a fumble.\" The NFL's Competition Committee re-examined the rule after the season but did not change the rule.\n\nThe tuck rule was enforced in a regular season game on October 8, 2005, between the Washington Redskins and the Denver Broncos. Broncos quarterback Jake Plummer lost the football while in the Broncos' own end zone. Referees initially called the play a fumble and awarded the Redskins a safety, but after instant-replay review cited the tuck rule in reversing the decision and calling it an incomplete pass. The Broncos eventually went on to win the game. Afterwards, Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs said, \"It makes no sense to me. It's the way it's worded. I think everybody probably sees that and says it's a bad rule.\" Pereira said the rule came up in games about 12 to 15 times per season and explained that despite its unpopularity, the competition committee had been unable to come up with a better rule.\n\nThe tuck rule was also enforced in a NFL playoff game on January 9, 2011, between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Baltimore Ravens. After this game, Mike Pereira, the former NFL vice-president for officiating, stated that he was no longer in support of the tuck rule.\n\nIn March 2013, the NFL competition committee proposed that league owners eliminate the tuck rule. The owners abolished the rule with a 29-1 vote at the 2013 annual meeting in Phoenix on March 20, 2013. The only team to vote against the elimination of the tuck rule was the Pittsburgh Steelers, while the New England Patriots and Washington Redskins abstained from the vote. Afterwards, referring obliquely to the 2002 Tuck Rule Game, Patriots owner Robert Kraft said, \"I love the tuck rule, and forever will, and I know [longtime Raiders owner] Al Davis, may he rest in peace, is probably smiling.”\n\nThe current rule reads:\n\nPasser Tucks Ball. If the player loses possession of the ball during an attempt to bring it back toward his body, or if the player loses possession after he has tucked the ball into his body, it is a fumble.\n\nNotes\n"}
{"id": "488005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=488005", "title": "Underwater hockey", "text": "Underwater hockey\n\nUnderwater Hockey (UWH), also known as Octopush (mainly in the United Kingdom) is a globally played limited-contact sport in which two teams compete to manoeuvre a puck across the bottom of a swimming pool into the opposing team's goal by propelling it with a hockey stick (pusher). It originated in England in 1954 when Alan Blake, a founder of the newly formed Southsea Sub-Aqua Club, invented the game he called Octopush as a means of keeping the club's members interested and active over the cold winter months when open-water diving lost its appeal. Underwater Hockey is now played worldwide, with the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques, abbreviated CMAS, as the world governing body. The first Underwater Hockey World Championship was held in Canada in 1980 after a false start in 1979 brought about by international politics and apartheid.\n\nTwo teams of up to ten players compete, with six players in each team in play at any one time. The remaining four players are continually substituted into play from a substitution area, which may be on deck or in the water outside the playing area, depending on tournament rules.\n\nBefore the start of play the puck is placed in the middle of the pool, and the players wait in the water whilst touching the wall above the goal they are defending. At the start-of-play signal (usually a buzzer or a gong) in-play members of both teams are free to swim anywhere in the play area and try to score by manoeuvring the puck into the opponents' goal. Players hold their breath as they dive to the bottom of the pool (a form of dynamic apnoea, as in free-diving). Play continues until either a goal is scored, when players return to their wall to start a new point, or a break in play is signalled by a referee (whether due to a foul, a time-out, or the end of the period of play).\nGames consist of two halves of typically ten to fifteen minutes (depending on tournament rules; 20 minutes at World Championship tournaments) and a short half-time interval of usually three minutes. At half time the two teams switch ends.\n\nA typical playing formation is 3-3 (three offensive players or \"forwards\", and three defensive players or \"backs\") of which 3-2-1 (three forwards, two mid-fielders and a back) is a variation. Other options include 2-3-1 (\"i.e.\", two forwards, three mid-fielders, and a back), 1-3-2, or 2-2-2. Formations are generally very fluid and are constantly evolving with different national teams being proponents of particular tweaks in formations, such as New Zealand with their 'box' (2-1-2-1) formation. As important to tournament teams' formation strategy is the substitution strategy; substitution errors might result in a foul (too many players in the play area) that can result in a player from the offending team being sent out, or maybe a tactical blunder (with too few defenders in on a play).\n\nThere are a number of penalties described in the official Underwater Hockey rules, ranging from the use of the stick against something (or someone) other than the puck, playing or stopping the puck with something other than the stick, and \"blocking\" (interposing one's self between a teammate who possesses the puck and an opponent; one is allowed to play the puck but not merely block opponents with one's body). If the penalty is minor, referees award an advantage puck: the team that committed the foul is pushed back from the puck, while the other team gets free possession. For major penalties such as a dangerous pass (e.g. striking an opponent's head) or intentional or repeated fouls, the referees may eject players for a specified period of time or the remainder of the game. A defender committing a serious foul sufficiently close to his own goal may be penalised by the award of a penalty shot or even a penalty goal to the fouled player's team. Since this is an underwater sport, surface spectators may be unaware of just how physical Underwater Hockey is.\n\nOften players who are most successful in this game are strong swimmers, have a great ability to hold and recover their breath, and are able to produce great speed underwater whilst demonstrating learned skills in puck control. It is also important that they are able to work well with their team members and take full advantage of their individual skills.\n\nAlthough Underwater Hockey is a limited-contact sport, there is a significant risk of injury. Many injuries are typical sports injuries such as sprains, torn muscles and light scratches. More major injuries might include hard impacts or deep cuts to the head, or dental trauma, but there is also risk of life-threatening injury due to being struck on the head possibly causing a concussion or black-out underwater. There is an obvious risk of drowning if knocked unconscious underwater but the players are under observation by the referees during competition, and players in any case tend to be very aware of what their teammates are doing or not doing - in practice an unconscious or seriously injured player is likely to be noticed and assisted or rescued very promptly. Personal protective equipment is available to reduce injury risks and the published rules make many items, such as mouthguards and earguards, mandatory. There is also a risk of pulmonary capillary stress failure (Hemoptysis) in some players.\n\nPlayers wear a diving mask, snorkel and fins, and carry in one (either) hand a short stick for playing the puck. A full list of equipment is given below:\n\nThere are usually no restrictions on swimwear, however baggy style trunks or shorts are not recommended as they reduce speed and increase drag in the water. Typical swimwear is swim briefs for male players and one-piece swimsuits for female players.\n\nA diving mask is used for several reasons:\nA low-volume mask with minimal protrusion from the face reduces the likelihood of the mask being knocked causing it to leak or flood and temporarily obstruct the player's vision. The published rules require masks to have two lenses to reduce the risk and extent of possible injury from puck impact; the danger of a single lens mask is that the aperture may be large enough to allow a puck to pass through it on impact, and hence into the player's eyes. A number of webbing strap designs are available to replace the original head strap with a non-elastic strap that can reduce the possibility of the player being unmasked.\n\nA snorkel enables players to watch the progress of the game without having to lift their head from the water to breathe. This allows them to keep their position on the surface, ready to resume play once they have recovered. In order to maximise the efficiency of breathing and reduce drag underwater snorkels are often short with a wide bore and may include a drain valve. The published rules mandate that they must not be rigid or have any sharp edges or points.\n\nThe snorkel may accommodate an external mouthguard which may be worn in conjunction with, or instead of, an internal mouthguard.\n\nFins allow the player to swim faster through the water. A wide variety of fins are used in the sport but large plastic/rubber composite fins or smaller, stiffer fibreglass or carbon fibre fins are commonplace at competitions. As with any of the equipment, the published rules mandate that the fins must have no sharp edges or corners, nor buckles.\n\nThe stick (also referred to as a 'pusher' or 'bat') is relatively short and is coloured white or black to indicate the player's team. The stick may only be held in one hand, which is usually determined by the player's handedness, although players may swap hands during play. The shape of the stick may affect playing style and is often a very personal choice. A wide variety of stick designs are allowed within the constraints of the rules of the game, the principal rules being that the stick (including the handle) must fit into a box of and that the stick must not be capable of surrounding either the puck or any part of the hand. A rule concerning the minimum radius of edges tries to address the risk of injury should body contact occur. Construction materials may be of wood or plastics and current rules now supersede those that previously required sticks to be homogeneous, although they almost always are anyway. Many UWH players manufacture their own sticks to their preferred shape and style, although there are increasingly more mass-produced designs to suit the majority (such as Bentfish, Britbat, CanAm, Dorsal, Stingray etc.).\n\nThe puck is approximately the size of an ice hockey puck but is made of lead or lead-based material - (adult size weighs , junior ) - and is encapsulated or surrounded by a plastic covering which is usually performance-matched to different pool bottoms (e.g. tiles, concrete etc.) to facilitate good grip on the stick face while preventing excessive friction on the pool bottom. The puck's weight brings it to rest on the pool bottom, though it can be lofted during passes.\n\nSafety gear includes ear protection, usually in the form of a water polo cap and as a secondary indicator of the player's team (coloured black/blue/dark or white/pale as appropriate). Water referees should wear red hats.\n\nA glove should be worn on the playing hand to protect against pool-bottom abrasion and, in some designs, for protection against puck impact on knuckles and other vulnerable areas, however no rigid protection is permitted. Players may choose to wear a protective glove on both hands, either as additional protection from the pool bottom or, for ambidextrous players, to switch the stick between hands mid-play. A glove used in competition must be a contrasting colour to the wearer's stick, but not orange which is reserved for referees' gloves - this is so water referees might be able to better distinguish between a pusher making a legal contact with the puck and a hand making an illegal contact with the puck.\n\nThe goals (or 'gulleys') are three metres wide and are sited on the pool bottom at opposite ends of the playing area in the centre of the end lines. They consist of a shallow slope leading up to a trough into which the puck may be pushed or flicked. Goals are commonly constructed from aluminium, galvanised steel or stainless steel. This makes them negatively buoyant and durable in the chlorinated water of swimming pools.\n\nRefereeing the game are two (or three) water referees (i.e. in the pool with full snorkelling gear, and wearing a distinctive red cap, orange gloves and golden yellow shirt) to observe and referee play at the pool bottom, and one or more poolside deck referees to track time (both in the period and for each ejected player), maintain the score, and call fouls (such as excessive number of players in play, failure to start a point from the end of the playing area, or another foul capable of being committed at or noticed from the surface). The deck (chief) referee responds to hand signals given by the water referees to start and stop play, including after an interruption such as a foul or time-out, or indeed to stop play if they themself see a rule infringement.\n\nThe Official Rules, which are available for download in PDF form without charge, define (with illustrations) a valid goal, the fouls and signals, and the dimensions of the playing area, sticks, and goals, as well as team composition and substitution procedure, and additional rules and arrangements for multi-team competitions.\n\nAt a club or training level, Underwater Hockey is not particularly spectator friendly. Very few pools have underwater viewing ports, and since the action is all below the surface, an observer would usually have to enter the water to see the skill and complexities of the game. Spectators may either put on mask, fins and snorkel and enter the pool for a view of the playing area, or possibly take advantage of the work of underwater videographers who have recorded major tournaments. Such tournaments often have live footage on large screens for the spectators which makes it a very exciting spectator sport. The 2006 (Sheffield, England) and 2010 (Durban, South Africa) Underwater Hockey World Championships were screened poolside and simultaneously webcast live to spectators around the world, while the 2008 European Championship in Istanbul, Turkey had excellent video coverage but no live streaming.\n\nFilming the games is challenging even for the experienced videographer, as the players' movements are fast and there are few places on the surface or beneath it which are free from their seemingly frenzied movements. Games are often played width-wise across a 50-metre pool to provide spaces in between simultaneous games for player substitutes, penalty boxes, coaches and camera crews. However, research and development of filming techniques is ongoing.\n\nOrganizers of major tournaments are usually the point of contact for acquiring footage of underwater hockey matches. Although no official worldwide repository exists for recorded games, there are many websites and instructional DVDs. A wide variety of related footage can be found on video sharing sites.\n\nUnderwater Hockey was started in the United Kingdom by Alan Blake in 1954. Blake was a founder-member of the newly formed Southsea Sub-Aqua Club (British Sub-Aqua Club No.9) and he and other divers including John Ventham, Jack Willis, and Frank Lilleker first played this game in Eastney Swimming Pool, Portsmouth, England. Originally called \"Octopush\" (and still known locally by that name in the United Kingdom today) the original rules called for teams of eight players (hence \"octo-\"), a bat reminiscent of a tiny shuffleboard stick called a \"pusher\" (hence the \"-push\"), an uncoated lead puck called a \"squid\", and a goal known at first as a \"cuttle\" but soon thereafter a \"gulley\". Apart from 'pusher' and to a lesser extent 'Octopush' much of this original terminology is now consigned to history.\n\nThe first rules were tested in a 1954 two-on-two game and an announcement was made in the November 1954 issue of \"Neptune\", the then-official news sheet of the British Sub-Aqua Club. \nThe first Octopush competition between clubs was a three-way tournament between teams from Southsea, Bournemouth and Brighton in early 1955. Southsea won then, and they are still highly ranked at national level today (they won again in 2009, 2012 and 2014).\n\nThe sport spread to Durban, South Africa in the mid/late 1950s by the spearfishermen of the Durban Undersea Club (DUC), when dirty summer seas prevented the young bloods from getting their weekly exercise and excitement. The first games were played in the pool of club member Max Doveton. However it soon became so popular that weekly contests were held in a municipal pool. The UK's Octopush used a small paddle to push the puck whilst the South Africans used a mini hockey stick. Whilst the 'long stick' version of underwater hockey did spread outside of South Africa, the UK's 'short stick' version ultimately prevailed and is how UWH is universally played now.\n\nIn the Americas, the game first came to Canada in 1962 via Norm Leibeck, an unconventional Australian scuba diving instructor and dive shop owner, who introduced the sport to a Vancouver dive club. Ten years later, the Underwater Hockey Association of British Columbia (UHABC) was formed and received support from the BC government.\n\nDown under, Underwater Hockey has been played in Australia since 1966, again because of Norm Leibeck, the same Australian, who returned from Canada with his Canadian bride Marlene, and it now attracts players from a wide range of backgrounds there. The first Australian Underwater Hockey Championships were held in Margaret River, Western Australia in 1975. A Women’s division was added to the championships in 1981 and a Junior division commenced in 1990.\n\nIn Asia, the game first came to the Philippines in the late 1970s through the scuba diving community that became aware of Octopush.\n\nBritish Pathe footage of an early game at Aldershot Lido in 1967\n\nUnderwater Hockey enjoys popularity in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States, as well as to a lesser extent in other countries such as Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, Israel, Japan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and Zimbabwe, and is gaining a foothold in numerous additional countries.\n\nHistorically, World Championships have been held every two years since 1980. At the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) 14th World Underwater Hockey Championship held in August 2006 in Sheffield, England, at the time a record 44 teams from 17 countries competed in six age and gender categories. Participating countries were Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Hungary, France, Italy, Japan, Jersey C.I., the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States. Subsequent world championships have been less well-attended, including the WAA World Championship held in 2008 in Durban, South Africa, until the 18th CMAS World Championship was held in Eger, Hungary in August 2013. This event once again saw all age and gender divisions, now including men and women in U19, U23, Masters and Elite categories compete. There were 68 teams competing across the eight age/gender divisions from 19 participating countries, making this World Championship the largest competition in the history of the sport to date. During 18th World Championships a decision was made by the federations to split the competition into two events with Junior Grades (U19, U23) to be accommodated in a separate event to be held every two years from 2015 with the competition for the Elite and Masters grades in Stellenbosch, South Africa in 2016.\n\nAt Elite level Australia are the current Men's World Champions, and South Africa are the current Women's World Champions. \nAt Masters level Australia are the current Men's World Champions, and Australia are the current Women's World Champions. \nAt U23 level Turkey are the current Men's World Champions, and New Zealand are the current Women's World Champions.\nAt U19 level France are the current Men's World Champions, and New Zealand are the current Women's World Champions.\n\nThe next World Championships for Elite and Masters grades are due to be held in Quebec, Canada in July 2018.\nThe next World Championships for the Age Groups are due to be held in Sheffield, England in August 2019.\n\nPolitical turmoil within the CMAS Underwater Hockey Commission (CMAS), the Underwater Hockey world governing body, came to a head soon after the 2006 World Championship, resulting in the CMAS Underwater Hockey Commission members resigning en masse and soon thereafter forming an alternative 'world governing body' solely for the sport of UWH, known as the World Aquachallenge Association (WAA), and which was officially ratified at the 1st WAA World Championship in April–May 2008. Consequently, from this point the UWH community had two world governing bodies, CMAS and WAA.\n\nCMAS has continued to organise international world competitions on a bi-annual basis. CMAS tried unsuccessfully to hold another World Underwater Games event in 2009 after a successful event in 2007. These were intended to be multi-disciplinary events thereby grouping UWH with other CMAS-represented sports including fin swimming and underwater rugby. The 1st World Games were held in Bari, Italy in 2007 while the 2nd was scheduled for Tunisia in 2009 but was cancelled and rescheduled as an UWH-only event held in Kranj, Slovenia during August 2009. It was billed as a World Championship but only one non-European country competed (South Africa); France won the Open division while Great Britain took the Women's title. In the years in between World Games CMAS holds Zone Championships (e.g. the 15th European Championship in Eger, Hungary during 2017).\n\nWAA attempted to continue with the original World Championship series on a bi-annual basis during years ending with an even number. The 1st WAA Championships (renumbered; it would have been the CMAS 15th) was held in 2008 in Durban, South Africa. The 2nd competition was scheduled for Medellin, Colombia in August 2010 but it proceeded as an International Event without WAA sanctioning and became the precursor for the development of the independent America's Cup International Tournament.\n\nThe European (CMAS) and the rest of the World (WAA) events following the split were held over exactly the same period in 2008 a continent apart. This dichotomy of championships coupled with the real possibility of future sanctions by CMAS on their member countries' organisations and athletes led to many countries being forced to choose which competition to send their team to. As a result, neither competition in 2008 was as well attended as had been the case in previous years, nor as competitive. Subsequently, no WAA sanctioned events have taken place since 2008. However, in Europe at least, well-organised international tournaments without CMAS or WAA influence (such as at Breda in the Netherlands, Barcelona in Spain, or České Budějovice in the Czech Republic) continue to be regularly attended by a range of club teams from across the continent.\n\nIn 2009, a new CMAS Underwater Hockey Commission was appointed for a 4-year period to guide the sport on a technical level and gradually it has reconsolidated the sport and produced a development plan to cope with future growth. The commission continues to work to develop relationships with CMAS Board of Directors and obtain support for its development plan.\n\nAs part of this plan the Commission developed an Age Group-based International Championship incorporating Under 19, Under 23 and Masters (Men >35, Women >32) Grades. This Championship was held in July 2011 in Dordrecht, Netherlands. The event was to be sanctioned by CMAS but the Dutch organising team withdrew their hosting bid and proceeded to host the event successfully with 36 teams participating. As the event was non-compliant with the CMAS Competition procedures, Scotland was able to compete as a separate country rather than within a combined entity as Great Britain.\n\nAs the surviving governing body, as of August 2013 CMAS has the following countries and territories affiliated with its Underwater Hockey Commission: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, United States of America.\n\n\n"}

In its final form the stadium was all-seated with a capacity of 13,000.\n\nThe stadium was the home ground of Hapoel Be'er Sheva from its opening in 1960.
