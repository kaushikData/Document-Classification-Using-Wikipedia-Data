It is one of only 2 clubs (the other being Dinamo Tbilisi) to have participated in the league continuously throughout its existence. Rustavi challenged for high positions in the league on a consistent basis, and recorded numerous top 3 finishes, always falling short of winning trophies.\n\nThe club's fortunes changed in 2006, when it acquired major sponsorship from the investment company 'Energy Invest'. They were now able to attract some of the best Georgian players to the club, as well as foreign imports. As a result, Rustavi convincingly won 4 league championships in a row, between 2007 and 2010. In addition, they won the Georgian cup in 2009, and numerous smaller national competitions. At the end of the 2009/10 season, 'Energy Invest' announced that the level of funding for the club would diminish, forcing them to compete with a young team and modest ambitions for 2 years. In 2012, the funding increased once more, and the squad was considerably strengthened.\n\nRustavi took part in various international competitions on several occasions, such as the Korać Cup in 1997, 98 and 99; the Eurocup in 2007; and the EuroChallenge in 2008, but failed to advance beyond the qualifying rounds on each occasion.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "663785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=663785", "title": "Bruce Grobbelaar", "text": "Bruce Grobbelaar\n\nBruce David Grobbelaar (born 6 October 1957) is a former Zimbabwe international footballer who played as a goalkeeper, most prominently for the English team Liverpool between 1981 and 1994. He is remembered for his gymnastic-like athletic ability, unflappable confidence and eccentric and flamboyant style of play. He has been the goalkeeper coach for Ottawa Fury FC of the North American Soccer League since 2014. In March 2018 he was announced as goalkeeper coach for the Matabeleland football team.\n\nBorn in South Africa, Grobbelaar grew up in neighbouring Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe), and served in the Rhodesian Army before he joined the Vancouver Whitecaps of the North American Soccer League in 1979. He gained Liverpool's attention during a loan spell at Crewe Alexandra during the 1979–80 season, and signed for the Merseyside club in 1981. Making 628 appearances for Liverpool over the next 13 years, including 440 in the League, he won the League championship with the club six times, as well as three FA Cups, three League Cups and the 1983–84 European Cup.\n\nGrobbelaar left Liverpool for Southampton in 1994, transferred to Plymouth Argyle two years later, and thereafter played for an assortment of English lower-league teams, never for more than a few games.\n\nIn his teenage years, Grobbelaar was a talented cricketer and was offered a baseball scholarship in the United States, but a career in football was his main ambition. His footballing career started with a Bulawayo-based team, Highlanders FC, in Rhodesia's second biggest city. In his late teens he was signed up by Durban City Football Club in South Africa, but left claiming to have been sidelined owing to his colour in this predominantly black team — the team had played in an all-white league until the previous year. Immediately after leaving Highlands Park, he was conscripted into National Service, spending eleven months on active service in the Rhodesia Regiment during the Rhodesian Bush War.\n\nIn 1979 Grobbelaar was signed by the Vancouver Whitecaps of the NASL after he had attended their scouting camp in South Africa.\n\nAt the Vancouver Whitecaps, Grobbelaar played under the management of former England and Blackpool goalkeeper, Tony Waiters, making his debut on 4 August 1979 against the Los Angeles Aztecs away. The Whitecaps lost 0–2, Johan Cruyff scoring one of the Aztecs' goals. Grobbelaar spent the rest of the season as second choice to former Wolverhampton Wanderers keeper Phil Parkes.\n\nDuring 1979, he visited England to see family friends, and a chance phone call from Ron Atkinson, brought him an impromptu trial with West Bromwich Albion. Atkinson was keen to sign Grobbelaar but owing to difficulties over gaining a work permit, the deal fell through. In stepped Crewe Alexandra, signing Grobbelaar on loan on 18 December 1979. In an early League appearance for the Railwaymen in Division 4, the unknown Grobbelaar was named on the Team Sheet in the York City Match Day Programme as \"Bill Grobbelaar\". During his time at Crewe, Grobbelaar played 24 League games and scored his only professional goal, a penalty, in his last game. By good fortune, on the evening when he gave his greatest performance for Crewe, he was spotted by Liverpool's head scout Tom Saunders.\n\nAt the end of the loan period, Grobbelaar returned to Vancouver for the 1980 NASL season. Although the Whitecaps had signed former Scotland international David Harvey from Leeds United, Grobbelaar emerged as first choice and became a cult figure for the Whitecaps faithful.\n\nBy the time Liverpool FC had completed their research on Grobbelaar, he had returned to Vancouver with his loan spell now over. Liverpool approached Tony Waiters with the idea of taking Grobbelaar to Anfield, and Waiters, who had a working relationship with Liverpool in the 1970s, paved the way for the move. Grobbelaar signed for Liverpool for £250,000 on 17 March 1981 as their reserve goalkeeper, but in mid-1981, regular goalkeeper Ray Clemence's surprise departure to Tottenham Hotspur gave Grobbelaar his opportunity.\n\nGrobbelaar made his debut on 28 August 1981 but failed to prevent Wolverhampton Wanderers winning the league fixture 1–0 at Molineux. Also making their debuts were defender Mark Lawrenson and midfielder Craig Johnston. His first clean sheet came a fortnight later at Anfield on 5 September, Arsenal were the visitors who were beaten by a 2–0 scoreline.\n\nGrobbelaar's early days as No.1 were strewn with errors and the Reds struggled to obtain any sort of consistency, Grobbelaar taking a lot of the blame. By the end of the calendar year Liverpool were mid table in the league and looked to be out of the running for title honours, especially as they had just lost to Manchester City 3–1 at Anfield in the Boxing Day fixture – a defeat which put John Bond's team top of the league. The New Year brought a new momentum as Bob Paisley began to get the best out of his players; they began the year in South Wales visiting the Vetch Field to play Swansea City in the FA Cup, Liverpool were in fine form and thumped their hosts 4–0. This set them on their way in the league and dropped just seven of the 50 available points overhauling the points gap that Ipswich Town had opened on them.\n\nGrobbelaar added the championship medal to the Milk Cup winners medal he had gained at Wembley on 13 March; the Reds beat Spurs 3–1, who had Ray Clemence in goal.\n\nDuring the period 1981–1994, Grobbelaar played 627 first team games for Liverpool, becoming known for his eccentric and flamboyant style. In 1984, the European Cup final between Liverpool and A.S. Roma finished 1–1 after extra time, and went to a penalty shootout. As Roma's Bruno Conti prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined-up behind, then proceeded to bite the back of the net, in imitation of eating spaghetti. Conti sent his spot kick over the bar. Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before Francesco Graziani took his kick, wobbling his legs in mock terror. Graziani missed and Liverpool went on to win the shootout 4–2.\n\nGrobbelaar was retained by three of Liverpool's greatest managers; Paisley, Fagan and Dalglish, over a period of 13 years. His strengths were his gymnastic-like agility, and an unflappable confidence. He was never afraid to be seen to berate his defenders if he thought they had given easy opportunities to the opposition, such as in his verbal assault on Jim Beglin in the first all Merseyside FA Cup final against Everton in 1986. Over the course of his Liverpool career he won more medals than any of his contemporaries.\n\nIn 1984–85, Grobbelaar brought down a spectator who had invaded the pitch during a game, allowing the police to handcuff the offending spectator.\n\nAlthough there were occasional challenges to his position as Liverpool's number 1, Grobbelaar was a virtual ever-present from Clemence's departure to the start of the 1990s which coincided with the end of the club's dominance. He was an ever-present in his first five league campaigns at Anfield, when Liverpool were champions four times and runners-up on the other occasion. However, in 1988–89, injuries and illness restricted his first team opportunities and he played 21 times in the league, with Mike Hooper taking his place on the other 17 occasions. However, he was fit to face Everton in the 3–2 FA Cup win on 20 May 1989, though six days later he conceded a last minute goal to Arsenal midfielder Michael Thomas on the final day of the league season as the league title was wrenched from Liverpool's grasp and headed to Highbury instead. A month earlier, he played in the FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest which was played at Old Trafford after the original match at Hillsborough was cancelled due to the tragedy that led to 96 fans dying on terracing just behind Grobbelaar's goal. Grobbelaar attended many of the victims' funerals.\n\nIt was the signing of David James from Watford in mid-1992 that spelt the beginning of the end for Grobbelaar. Although James struggled to impress at first, Grobbelaar's insistence on playing for Zimbabwe gave James chances; Grobbelaar only played six times for Liverpool during 1992–93 and spent a short period on loan at Second Division side Stoke City where he made four appearances. James's uncertainty allowed Grobbelaar to regain his place in the first team at the start of the 1993–94 season, in which his performance, like the team's, started well but fell away badly. In a notorious incident in a Merseyside derby that year, Grobbelaar even physically assaulted young team mate Steve McManaman. He was ever-present until he was injured in the final minute of a 2–0 defeat at Leeds United on 19 February 1994. It turned out to be his final appearance for the club.\n\nIn 14 years at the club, he had won six league title medals, three FA Cup winner's medal, three Football League Cup winner's medals and a European Cup winner's medal.\n\nGrobbelaar left Liverpool in mid-1994, transferring on a free to Southampton. He made his debut on 20 August 1994 in the 1–1 league draw with Blackburn Rovers at The Dell. He spent two seasons with the Saints competing with another goalkeeper with a reputation for eccentricity, Dave Beasant. Despite the fuss caused by the match-fixing allegations (see below), manager Alan Ball maintained faith in him, and he kept his place in the team for most of the 1994–95 season.\n\nAllegations that Grobbelar had been match-fixing first appeared in November 1994. Nevertheless, in his next game, at home to Arsenal, he managed to keep a clean sheet despite the media frenzy that surrounded the game. The \"Southern Daily Echo\" reported that Grobbelaar was \"swept along on a tidal wave of emotion, to emerge triumphant from the toughest match of his life\".\n\nIn the 1995–96 season, Grobbelaar only managed two games for the Saints, before moving on to Plymouth Argyle.\n\nGrobbelaar spent the 1996–97 season with Plymouth, after which he spent short spells at Oxford United, Sheffield Wednesday, Oldham Athletic, Chesham United, Bury, Lincoln City and Northwich Victoria over the next 2 years before returning to his native country.\n\nGrobbelaar was born in Durban, South Africa to ethnic Afrikaner parents. When he was two months old he emigrated to Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980) with his mother and sister to join his father, who had got a job on the railways there.\n\nGrobbelaar grew up and learnt his football in Rhodesia. He made his international debut for Rhodesia as a 19-year-old in a friendly versus South Africa in 1977. Grobbelaar played for Zimbabwe in both of their 1982 World Cup qualifying matches versus Cameroon. He also appeared for his country in a qualifying match for the 1986 World Cup versus Egypt.\n\nIn 1992, he returned to the national team after an absence of several years. With a team including Grobbelaar and Adam and Peter Ndlovu, Zimbabwe came just a victory short of qualification for the 1994 World Cup under the guidance of manager Reinhard Fabisch. Grobbelaar earned 32 caps for Zimbabwe between 1980 and 1998.\n\nIn 2018, Grobbelaar played a one off game for Matabeleland in the ConiFA World Cup. In it he came off injured after around 30 minutes.\n\nOn 10 November 1994, Grobbelaar was accused by the British tabloid newspaper \"The Sun\" of match fixing during his time at Liverpool to benefit a betting syndicate, after being caught on videotape discussing match-fixing. He was charged with conspiracy to corrupt, along with the Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans Segers and Aston Villa striker John Fashanu (only recently signed from Wimbledon), and a Malaysian businessman, Heng Suan Lim.\n\nDespite these allegations, Grobbelaar and Segers were allowed to continue playing, while Fashanu retired from playing less than a year after being charged. Grobbelaar pleaded not guilty, claiming he was only gathering evidence with the intent of taking it to the police. After two successive trials, in both of which the jury could not agree on a verdict, he and his co-defendants were cleared in November 1997. Grobbelaar later sued \"The Sun\" for libel and was awarded £85,000. \"The Sun\" appealed, and the case was eventually taken to the House of Lords where it was found that, though the specific allegations had not been proved, there was adequate evidence of dishonesty. The Lords slashed his award to £1, the lowest libel damages possible under English law, and ordered him to pay \"The Sun\"'s legal costs, estimated at £500,000. In his judgement, Lord Bingham of Cornhill observed:\n\n\"The tort of defamation protects those whose reputations have been unlawfully injured. It affords little or no protection to those who have, or deserve to have, no reputation deserving of legal protection. Until 9 November 1994 when the newspaper published its first articles about him, the appellant's public reputation was unblemished. But he had in fact acted in a way in which no decent or honest footballer would act and in a way which could, if not exposed and stamped on, undermine the integrity of a game which earns the loyalty and support of millions.\"\n\nGrobbelaar was unable to pay the costs and was declared bankrupt. He and Segers did not retire from playing until some time after being cleared of their involvement in the alleged match fixing.\n\nGrobbelaar moved back to his home of origin South Africa where he coached a number of teams with various degrees of success. He managed Seven Stars in 1999 and took the team from the relegation zone to finish fourth in the final league table. In 2001, he took over struggling Hellenic. While at the club, he saved them from relegation, and played in their last match of the season, against Kaizer Chiefs, starting the game, and substituting himself after 20 minutes after cracking his ribs. He was the oldest player ever to have played in the South African league, at 44 years old, until his record was beaten in 2013 by fellow keeper Andre Arendse. He also spent time coaching Supersport United, Manning Rangers (2004) and Umtata Bush Bucks (2004), as well as in Zimbabwe, where he was twice briefly player-manager of Zimbabwe's national team in 1997 and 1998.\n\nGrobbelaar came back to the United Kingdom briefly to help coach a number of clubs. Grobbelaar has recently stated that he \"hopes to one day return to Anfield as the manager of Liverpool FC.\"\n\nGrobbelaar returned to England in 2006 to play in a replay of the 1986 FA cup final against Everton for the Marina Dalglish Appeal, a charity for Cancer research set up by former team-mate and manager Kenny Dalglish and his wife, Marina, a cancer survivor. Liverpool won the match 1–0.\n\nGrobbelaar played in the Sky One's \"The Match\" in 2004 and \"The Match 3\" in 2006, keeping a clean sheet in both games.\n\nGrobbelaar, also known as \"Brucie\", is still a firm favourite amongst the Anfield faithful, and was voted as No.17 in a poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop conducted in mid-2006 by the official Liverpool Football Club website. Over 110,000 worldwide voted for their best 10 players in the Anfield club's history, with Grobbelaar finishing 2nd in the goalkeeping stakes.\n\nIn March 2007, Liverpool's official website announced that Grobbelaar would come out of retirement for a one-off game and play for non-league Castleford side Glasshoughton Welfare to help them in their fight for survival. He played against Maltby Main on 14 April 2007, helping Glasshoughton to a 2–1 win.\n\nOn 16 April 2009 episode of ITV's \"Hell's Kitchen\" Grobbelaar wore a black armband on his left arm in remembrance of the 20th Anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. On 22 April, he left the show citing a need to be reunited with his wife.\n\nHe was persuaded to play for Winterbourne United in their Gloucestershire FA Trophy game against Patchway Town on 5 December 2009 but in the end did not make an appearance. Winterbourne at that time were managed by Nicky Tanner, who was a team mate of Grobbelaar at Liverpool.\n\nDuring the World Cup 2010 in South Africa he appeared on Norwegian TV-channel TV 2.\n\nGrobbelaar currently resides in Corner Brook, Newfoundland, Canada. Grobbelaar is active in the local soccer scene, playing keeper for Corner Brook Men's Soccer League team West Side Monarchs, and occasionally lending his expertise to the Corner Brook Minor Soccer Association as a coach.\n\nIn May 2018 he became goalkeeping coach for the Matabeleland football team, and on June 1 it was announced that he would join the playing roster for their remaining group games. It was subsequently announced by head coach Justin Walley that he would start in goal against Chagos Islands on 7 June 2018.\n\nSource:\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

That is, they stand next to a base in anticipation of receiving the ball thrown from another fielder, so that they may make a play on an opposing baserunner who is approaching that base. On a force play, the fielder covering the base stands with one foot on that base.\n\nIn general, the first baseman covers first base, the second baseman or shortstop covers second, the third baseman covers third, and the catcher covers home plate. However, on ground balls hit to the first baseman away from first base, the pitcher will cover first base instead. On a ground ball to either the shortstop or the second baseman, the other of those will cover second base.\n\nWith a runner on first base, when a ground ball is hit to the third baseman, second base will be covered by the second baseman, because unlike the shortstop he does not have to turn his back to the third baseman in order to get to second base. Likewise, with a runner on first base, when a ground ball is hit to the first baseman, second base will be covered by the shortstop, who unlike the second baseman does not have to turn his back toward the first baseman in order to get to second base.\n\nWhen a runner on first base attempts to steal second base, the shortstop and second baseman will have arranged in advance which one will cover second base to receive the ball from the catcher. Likewise, when the pitcher attempts to pick off a runner at second base, the shortstop and second baseman will have arranged in advance which one will cover second base.\n\nWith baserunners on first and second bases, sometimes the shortstop will cover third base on a bunt, a coverage plan known as the \"rotation play\" or \"wheelplay.\" This occurs if the batter bunts the ball toward third base so that the third baseman cannot cover third base because he is moving forward to field the ball.\n\nIf the defense is employing an extreme shift, with the shortstop playing on the first-base side of second base and with the third baseman playing near second base (because by reputation the batter is anticipated to hit the ball to the right side of the infield), in some cases the pitcher may need to cover third base.\n\nWhen the pitcher throws a wild pitch, or when the catcher permits a passed ball, so that in either case the catcher has to retreat farther into foul territory away from home plate to retrieve the ball, if there is a runner on third base the pitcher will cover home plate.\n\nDepending on the situation, however, various fielders can cover any base, and sometimes even an outfielder can cover a base.\n\nIn American English, the expression \"cover your bases\" used outside of a baseball setting means to be thoroughly prepared for something.\n"}

The game rapidly gained a reputation among players as a \"joystick killer\" because of the constant vigorous waggling of the joystick required during many of the events.\n\nThe Spectrum version was the first game to use Speedlock, a fast loader on the computer.\n\nThe soundtrack of the C64 version of the game was composed by Martin Galway and David Dunn. The introduction music is based on the 1978 electronic music piece \"Rydeen\" by Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO).\n\n\"Sinclair User\" gave the game a score of 8/10. It went on to become the biggest selling Spectrum game of Q4 1984. The game won the award for Best (Overall) Arcade Game in \"Crash\" magazine's Readers Awards 1984 and was the Best Arcade-Style Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards.\n\nThe game was included on the 1985 compilation \"They Sold a Million\", along with \"Beach-Head\", \"Sabre Wulf\", and \"Jet Set Willy\". In 2017, the game placed on Eurogamer's \"10 games that defined the ZX Spectrum\" list.\n\n"}

The dead rubber match therefore has no effect on the winner and loser of the series, other than the total number of matches won and lost.\n\nThe term is used in Davis Cup and Fed Cup tennis, as well as in international cricket, field hockey, the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League and Rugby World Cup.\n\nFor example, in a Davis Cup series, each pair of competing countries play five matches (\"rubbers\") where the winner is decided on a best-of-five basis. Once one team has reached three victories, the remaining match or matches are said to be \"dead rubbers\". International Tennis Federation's last revision of the competition policies on dead rubbers is from 2011.\n\nSince the result of a dead rubber has no impact in determining the winner of a series, dead rubbers are typically played in a less intense atmosphere, often allowing the team that has lost the series to obtain a match win. Sometimes, second-string players who have not played many matches in top-level competition are given the opportunity to play a dead rubber in order to gain experience. This practice makes completing a clean sweep of a series less likely.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1644364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1644364", "title": "He Got Game", "text": "He Got Game\n\nHe Got Game is a 1998 American sports drama film written, produced and directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington. This is the third of four film collaborations between Washington and Lee.\n\nWashington portrays Jake Shuttlesworth, father of the top-ranked basketball prospect in the country, Jesus Shuttlesworth, played by NBA star Ray Allen. Jake, in prison for killing his wife, is released on parole for a week by the state's governor to persuade his son to play for the governor's alma mater in exchange for a much reduced prison sentence.\n\nJesus Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen), the top high school basketball player in the United States, is being pursued by the top college basketball programs in the nation. His father, Jake, is a convicted felon serving time at Attica Correctional Facility for accidentally killing his wife, Martha, (Jesus' mother) six years earlier. Jake is temporarily released by the governor, an influential alumnus of \"Big State,\" one of the colleges Jesus is considering, so that he might persuade his son to sign with the governor's college. If successful, he'll get an early release from prison.\n\nWhile seemingly a sound plan, it turns haywire due to the strained relationship between Jesus (who resents his father for killing his mother) and Jake. Upon his first moments outside of prison, Jake contacts his daughter, Mary Shuttlesworth (Zelda Harris), who is happy to see him. Mary invites her father to the apartment where she and Jesus now live, having moved out of their Uncle Bubba's place. When Jesus returns home from school, he is unhappy to see his father. Refusing to look him in the eye, he tells his sister to get rid of the \"stranger\" in their living room. Jesus later agrees to meet with his father at an alternative location away from Mary. Throughout the movie, Jake tries to persuade Jesus to attend \"Big State\" with seemingly no success. Eventually, he divulges the deal set up by the governor. However, Jesus appears unsympathetic to his father's situation. \n\nFlashbacks illustrate the younger Jesus' gruelling basketball training under his father, and the night an argument between Jake and Jesus escalated into violence, resulting in Jake accidentally killing Jake's mother after she intervened. Jake reveals to Jesus the origin of the first name which embarrassed Jesus in childhood: Jake tells his son he named him not after Jesus Christ but after basketball player Earl Monroe, who had the nicknames \"Jesus\" (which the white media changed to \"Black Jesus\").\n\nIntertwined with the story of the Shuttlesworth family is the sub-plot of Dakota Barns (Milla Jovovich), a prostitute who stays in the room next to Jake in the run-down hotel, which the warden has booked for him. Dakota is being abused by her procurer and companion, Sweetness. Jake overhears the violence through the thin walls. Throughout the film, Jake is seen helping clean Dakota's wounds, and Jake gives Dakota some of his money to be used for his expenses during his week out of prison. He also develops a romantic relationship with her. Dakota is seen in one of the final scenes of the movie taking a Greyhound bus away from New York City.\n\nJesus is tempted with offers of cash and women on recruiting visits to big time basketball programs. He also considers declaring the NBA in order to play professionally sooner and immediately lift himself and his sister out of poverty. Jake finally challenges Jesus to a game of one-on-one basketball, the winner being the first player to score 11. If Jake wins, Jesus will sign a letter of intent to play for \"Big State\" and if Jesus wins, he can make his own decision. After a competitive start, Jake tires during the course of the game and Jake wins, 11-5. Jake gives the letter of intent to his son, who casts it to the ground. AS Jake is collected for transportation back to Attica, he turns to Jesus and says, \"Let me tell you something, son: You get that hatred out your heart, or you'll end up just another nigger...like your father.\"\n\nUltimately, Jesus decides to sign to play for \"Big State.\" However, the governor does not give Jake the promised reduction, and Jake's work-release is fabricated in the media as an escape from prison before being recaptured. Jake ultimately finds freedom by casting away his dreams and burdens to his son, Jesus, symbolized by the throwing of his old basketball over the prison wall and magically onto the Big State court where Jesus is practicing alone. Jesus clutches the ball, knowing it is a message of hope from his father.\n\nFilming took place between July and September 1997. Locations included Coney Island, Brooklyn, Cabrini–Green housing projects in Chicago, Illinois, Elon University, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Los Angeles, California.\n\nFor the role of Jesus, Lee had drawn up a list of every NBA player who could pass for a high school senior. Kobe Bryant was the original choice to portray Jesus Shuttlesworth, but after shooting several air balls that resulted in a brutal playoff loss to the Utah Jazz in the 1997 NBA Playoffs, he planned an extensive workout plan that would help maintain his strength throughout the duration of the longer NBA seasons. Lee found Tracy McGrady too reserved and was not impressed by Allen Iverson's performance. Management for Kevin Garnett and Stephon Marbury wanted a guarantee that one or the other would be offered the part. Travis Best, Walter McCarty, and Rick Fox also auditioned, and Lee cast them in supporting roles. Lee approached Allen during halftime of a Bucks-Knicks game, ultimately offering him the role of Jesus. Allen had never acted before, and he trained with an acting coach for eight weeks prior to filming.\n\nNBA players Shaquille O'Neal, Reggie Miller, Bill Walton, Scottie Pippen, Michael Jordan, and Charles Barkley, Syracuse University coach Jim Boeheim, NBA coaches Rick Pitino and George Karl and broadcaster Dick Vitale made cameo appearances at one point early in the film.\nFormer football legend Jim Brown also appears as one of Jake's parole officers, assigned to keep tabs on him while he's away from the prison.\n\n\"He Got Game\" was produced on an estimated $25 million budget. In the opening weekend of its release, it was shown on 1,319 screens, and took in $7,610,663 at the U.S. box offices debuting at #1. It eventually grossed a total of $21,554,585.00, which was a box office flop considering it fell short of its $25 million budget.\n\nResponse to the film was largely favorable, with review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes showing it receiving 80% favorable reviews, praising Lee's artfulness, commentary, and honest connection to human characters. Negative reviews focused their criticism on the film's length and Lee's overindulgence, with \"Time Out London\" writing, \"Most scenes play too long, with a surplus of ideas, textures, tones and characters, and after 134 minutes it's clear Lee's problem with closure hasn't gone away.\" Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half-stars, and called it Lee's best film since \"Malcolm X\". He was particularly encouraged by Lee's determination not to adhere to typical conventions.\n\nBoth Ray Allen and Washington drew praise for their performances, with Roger Ebert writing that Allen \"is that rarity, an athlete who can act,\" and \"Slate\" magazine writing that Washington's performance was \"gorgeously underplayed\".\n\nESPN's review pointed out factual flaws in the story: \"...coaches aren't allowed to discuss potential recruits until after the signing period. Come on, Spike. (And while we're at it, players aren't allowed to visit a college one week before the signing deadline; Jesus couldn't live alone with his sister without both of them being thrown in a foster home; and there's NO WAY IN HELL that Jesus wouldn't have just turned pro if he was that good and that broke.)\" \n\nThe soundtrack for \"He Got Game\" was composed of numerous orchestral pieces by Aaron Copland with songs created by Public Enemy. It was released by Def Jam on April 21, 1998.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2859226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2859226", "title": "Hindmarsh Stadium", "text": "Hindmarsh Stadium\n\nThe Hindmarsh Stadium (currently known as the Coopers Stadium due to sponsorship from the Adelaide-based Coopers Brewery) is a multi-purpose stadium in Hindmarsh, an inner western suburb of Adelaide, South Australia. It is the home of the Australian A-League team, Adelaide United.\n\nThe stadium has a capacity of 16,500, of which 15,000 is seated. Home team Adelaide United regularly fill this capacity, and averaged crowds of over 12,000 to its matches during the 2006-07 Season and 2007-08 Season. United used the stadium for its home matches in the 2008 AFC Asian Champions League, the 2010 AFC Asian Champions League, and the 2012 AFC Asian Champions League.\n\nBuilt in 1960, the stadium stands on the site that was once Hindmarsh Oval which housed the West Torrens Football Club of the SANFL from 1905 until 1921, when the team moved to nearby Thebarton Oval which would remain its home until 1989. During World War I the Patriotic Football League, a group of SANFL clubs that wanted to continue playing football during the war played many games at the venue. The 1916 Patriotic Football League Grand Final was held at the ground between and with Port Adelaide winning 7.11 (53) to 1.13 (19).\n\nThe Soccer Association of South Australia owned land on a former brick pit on Torrens Road at Brompton named Rowley Park which was located only 5 km from the city, and the original plan was for the land to be the home of Soccer in SA as the site formed a natural bowl. However, the Soccer Association had received negative press regarding its failure to grow grass on the site. Rowley Park also had a tendency to flood during winter as the bottom of \"The Brick Pit\" was below the level of the water table which made playing soccer virtually impossible. The land was eventually leased to a group of speedway drivers and would become the famous Rowley Park Speedway which ran from December 1949 until it closed in April 1979. The land was eventually sold and is now the Kym Bonython housing estate, named for the speedway's long time promoter Kym Bonython.\n\nWhen it became obvious to the Soccer Association that Rowley Park would be unsuitable as a soccer venue they obtained a lease on Hindmarsh Oval from the Hindmarsh Council. The old Hindmarsh Oval was developed over the years into a rectangular stadium capable of holding 15,000 with a single tier grandstand built in 1960 that held approximately 2,000 while 6 light towers for night games (plus another 8 smaller light towers on the grandstand roof) were installed during the mid-1970s. Other than the grandstand, the ground was all terracing surrounding the playing surface. This changed in 1996 when seats were installed on the eastern side of the ground.\n\nAlong with the Olympic Sports Field, Hindmarsh became one of two Adelaide venues in the then new but now-defunct National Soccer League in 1977. Hindmarsh was the home ground of the Adelaide City Zebras (who also played games at the Sports Field), and later the home ground for West Adelaide Hellas. Hindmarsh would eventually become the sole Adelaide NSL venue during the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1986 Hindmarsh stadium hosted the first leg of the NSL Grand Final between Adelaide City and Sydney Olympic. Unfortunately for Adelaide fans Olympic won 1-0. Adelaide would go on to win the 2nd leg in Sydney 3-1 and become NSL Champions. Hindmarsh again hosted the NSL Grand Final (this time a single game) in 1994-95 when Adelaide City faced the Mark Viduka led Melbourne Knights. In front of a packed house of over 16,000 the Knights defeated the Zebras 2-0.\n\nAs soccer was generally played to smaller crowds during the 1970s and 80's, Hindmarsh became a regular host of the Socceroos in some of their international matches, with Adelaide-based players such as Robert Zabica, Alex Tobin, and the Vidmar brothers Aurelio and Tony all playing prominent roles.\n\nHindmarsh Stadium not only hosted soccer matches but also hosted Rugby Union and Rugby League. In 1992 the New Zealand All Blacks played an exhibition game against a South Australian 'Select' team which included former Wallabies Lock and current day author/media personality Peter FitzSimons. The All Blacks, including goal kicking Stand-off Grant Fox who would retire the following year as the All Blacks highest ever point scorer, ran out easy winners while FitzSimons, playing up to the crowd by humorously claiming innocence, was sent off midway through the second half after numerous infringements. At the time this made FitzSimons the only Wallaby (although his international career had finished by the time of the match) to ever be sent off in a match against the All Blacks.\n\nIn 1996 as part of the rebuilding of the venue before the 2000 Summer Olympic Games, the original single tier grandstand with its wooden bench seats was demolished and replaced by the current two tier structure. The terracing on the opposite wing was also removed and replaced by seating. When the ground was rebuilt before the Olympics only the new grandstand would remain in place.\nIn 1998 the short lived National Rugby League team the Adelaide Rams used Hindmarsh for their last 4 home games of the 1998 NRL season. The Rams début at the venue was a success when they thumped the Balmain Tigers 52-0 in front of 7,351 fans. The Rams would end up 2-2 at Hindmarsh after defeating the Auckland Warriors, but losing to Manly-Warringah and North Sydney. The Rams were to continue using Hindmarsh as their home ground in the 1999 NRL season giving them a rectangular venue suited to league rather than an oval as was their previous home, the Adelaide Oval. However the team was wound up by owners News Ltd only weeks before the start of the 1999 season.\n\nHindmarsh Stadium was one of the venues chosen to host preliminary matches for the men's soccer during the 2000 Olympics held in Sydney. This saw the stadium receive almost a complete rebuild which brought it to its present status. The field was lengthened from 110 to 120 metres to be able to also accommodate both rugby league and rugby union which used longer field dimensions (though the minimum field length of a union field including in-goal areas is actually 120 metres so shorter than desirable in-goals are required), the six old light towers were replaced with four television standard ones (one in each corner with lights also on the front edge of the grandstand roof) and the former terracing was now all seated, uncovered stands with only the grandstand built in the mid-1990s remaining in place. During the Olympics, temporary stands were erected in the corners of the stadium to bring capacity up to 20,000. Hosting matches from Groups A and B, the recorded attendance at Hindmarsh was set at 18,340 when Italy drew 1-1 Nigeria on 19 September 2000.\n\nOther soccer played in the stadium in the past include several international matches, including most of the games played in the 2004 OFC Nations Cup - an event where the Socceroos began their qualifying campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In 2007 the venue hosted the first two rounds of the Olyroos campaign as they qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics. With the rise in the sports popularity in Australia, Hindmarsh is rarely used these days by the Socceroos other than for training purposes or matches against lower ranked countries such as those from the Pacific islands. International matches now generally take place at larger capacity venues such as Sydney's 84,000 seat ANZ Stadium, Brisbane's 52,500 seat Suncorp Stadium, or the largest stadium in the Southern Hemisphere, the 100,024 capacity Melbourne Cricket Ground. Though with the redevelopment of the Adelaide Oval to a world class, FIFA compliant 53,583 capacity stadium (50,083 seated), there is renewed speculation that the Socceroos will return to Adelaide for high-profile international matches.\n\nOn 15 April 2006 on a Saturday night the stadium hosted its first NRL match since the Rams final home game in 1998 when the Sydney-based Penrith Panthers played that year's NRL Grand Finalist the Melbourne Storm. With 7,017 fans in attendance the Storm ran out easy 40-18 winners with emerging rugby league superstar Greg Inglis scoring 3 tries for Melbourne. It was a home match for the Panthers who brought the game to Adelaide due to renovations being completed at their usual home, Penrith Park in western Sydney.\n\nThe Stadium's Record attendance outside of the 2000 Olympic Games is 17,000 at the 2008 AFC Champions League Final Second leg between Adelaide United and Gamba Osaka of Japan. Adelaide lost 2-0, but still became tournament runners up. This remains Adelaide United's record attendance at Hindmarsh.\nOn 3 October 2008 it was announced by the SA Government Minister for Recreation and Sport Michael Wright coach Ricky Stuart, head coach of Sydney-based NRL team the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, that the Sharks would play three NRL home games at Hindmarsh over 3 years starting from 2009. The first of those was against the North Queensland Cowboys on 19 April 2009. On a sunny autumn day the Cowboys defeated the Sharks 34-10 in front of 8,547 fans, the record crowd for a rugby league match at Hindmarsh.\n\nUnfortunately for NRL fans in Adelaide it was announced early in the 2010 season that Cronulla had been allowed by the SA Government to pull out of their contract. Cronulla's official reasons were wanting to concentrate on their home fans by not taking home games away from Toyota Stadium. The NRL return to Adelaide in 2010 when another Sydney based club Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs played a home game at the Adelaide Oval instead of Hindmarsh against the Melbourne Storm. The Bulldogs had planned to make the Adelaide Oval their 'other' home, returning in 2011, again against the Storm, but this was also abandoned after just two years.\n\nThe venue took host to the inaugural FFA cup final on 16 December 2014 which saw Adelaide United face Perth Glory. United were 1-0 victors with an attendance of 16,142.\n\nHindmarsh Stadium hosted seven games of the 2000 Olympic Games Men's Football tournament including a Quarter final match. The stadium's all-time attendance record of 18,430 was set during the Group A match between Italy and Nigeria.\n\nHindmarsh Stadium has hosted six top grade rugby league matches.\n\n"}

Mentions of lapta have been found in medieval manuscripts, and balls and bats were found in the 14th-century layers during excavations in Novgorod. It is similar to cricket, brännboll, Rounders, baseball, oină, (Italy) and pesäpallo.\n\nThe game is played outside on a field the size of half a football pitch 20 x 25 sazhens ( x ). There are 5 people on the field from the defending team, as well as pitcher/server. This pitcher server stands near the batter of the opposing team and hits a ball in the direction of the batter. The team that bats contains six people. Each hitter gets 2 chances to hit the ball over a 10m line. If they succeed at that, the runners can go to an endline at the other end of the pitch. If a player manages to run between the two endpoints, they get 2 points. A game lasts an hour, split into two equal halves.\n\nThe edges of the field were marked with parallel lines, called \"salo\".\n\nThe goal of the game is to hit the ball, served by a player of the opposite team, with the bat and send the ball as far as possible, then run across the field to the \"kon\" line, and if possible to run back to the \"gorod\" line.\n\nThe running player should try to avoid being hit with the ball, which is thrown by the opposing team members. For successful runs, the team earns points. A team wins by either getting more points during the scheduled time or by having all its players complete runs.\n\nA description of lapta is given by Aleksandr Kuprin: This folk game is one of the most interesting and useful games. Lapta requires resourcefulness, deep breathing, faithfulness to your group, attention, dexterity, fast running, good aiming and marksmanship, strong striking hands, and firm eternal confidence that you cannot be defeated. The lazy and cowardly have no place in this game.\n"}

It is home to the BYU Cougars men's and women's basketball teams. The seating capacity for basketball games at the Marriott Center is officially 18,987.\n\nThe largest basketball arena in the West Coast Conference (in which BYU competes for most sports, except football), it is among the largest on-campus basketball arenas in the nation. In addition to basketball, the Marriott Center is used for weekly devotionals and forums.\n\nThe elevation of the court is approximately above sea level.\n\nThe Marriott Center was named in honor of benefactor and hotel tycoon J. Willard Marriott, founder of the Marriott Corporation. When the arena opened in 1971, it passed the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena as the largest college basketball arena in the nation. It was also the largest venue in the nation built for basketball, larger than any NBA (or ABA) arena at that time. It lost both distinctions when the University of Kentucky opened Rupp Arena in 1976, but remained as the largest basketball-specific facility on a U.S. college campus until 1987, when the University of Tennessee opened Thompson–Boling Arena.\nPrior to 1971, the Cougars played basketball games at Smith Fieldhouse, which remains the primary venue for volleyball and gymnastics. The court was replaced in 2003 with a permanent floor.\n\nThe Marriott Center hosted the West Regionals of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament four times (1972, 1977, 1979, 1982), and the Western Athletic Conference men's basketball tournament in 1988.\n\nOn February 7, 1993, Cody Judy threatened LDS apostle Howard W. Hunter with a supposed bomb in front of a crowd of 15,000–17,000 onlookers in the Marriott Center.\n\nIn 1999, the Marriott Center set an NCAA record for highest attendance for a men's volleyball match: 14,156 watched BYU defeat Long Beach State on February 19, shattering the previous record of 10,225 (held by Hawaii).\n\nIn April 2012, BYU announced renovations to the Marriott Center. The lower bench seating on the north side was replaced with prime chair seating. A new sound system was installed, and the men's and women's locker rooms were renovated. The changes in the lower seating lowered the Marriott Center’s capacity from 22,700 to 20,951.\n\nThe remaining lower bench seating was replaced after the 2015 season, lowering seating capacity to around 19,000. The new renovation also installed new video boards for the Marriott Center and the Marriott Center Annex building, where practice sessions take place for both teams. The Marriott Center Annex (nicknamed the \"Y\" MCA) was placed between the Marriott Center and the BYU Broadcasting Building.\n\n\n"}

The Scottish Rugby Union and the Scottish Football Association use it as a training facility, as do Heart of Midlothian F.C. for first-team training and to run their academy. It is also used by other sports teams, students and members of the public.\n\nA review of Scottish football, led by former First Minister of Scotland Henry McLeish, picked up on the lack of facilities in Scotland in the first report published in April 2010. In February 2012, Sport Minister Shona Robison announced that £25million from the Scottish Government's Young Scots Fund would be put towards a new multi-sports centre which would include a national football academy. Universities, colleges and local authorities were invited to bid. By August 2013 there were three finalists. In September 2013, it was announced that the design by Reiach & Hall was chosen. The remaining £9million towards the cost of building came from sportscotland, Heriot-Watt University and the City of Edinburgh Council.\n\nConstruction work began in March 2015. The £33million facility opened in August 2016. The indoor football pitch is covered by a curved steel frame with a PVC roof, the shape of which has been likened to the trajectory of \"the goal which defied physics\" which was scored by Brazilian football player Roberto Carlos against France in 1997. The building won the Future Building section at the 2016 Scottish Design Awards.\n\nThe Scottish Rugby Union and the Scottish Football Association have both made long-term commitments to using Oriam ahead of international fixtures. Heart of Midlothian F.C. use the facility to run their academy and for first-team training. The Scottish Handball Association, basketballscotland and Scottish Netball also use the facility. Furthermore, it is used by the recently formed professional women’s team in basketball and handball, both launched in summer 2016. Unlike some elite performance facilities, Oriam will be available to other sports teams, students and members of the public. For the 2016–17 season, Hibernian F.C. will play their under-20 fixtures at Oriam.\n\nThe centre has a FIFA-accredited indoor synthetic 3G pitch which is the largest of its type in Europe. Its dimensions of 116 yards by 76 yards are the same size as those of Hampden Park's pitch. At the midpoint of this playing space, the roof is 28m high and there is a 15m playing height at the sides. The space accommodates a viewing area that can seat 500 people. There is also a synthetic pitch outdoors. There are natural surfaces outside too- five grass football pitches and two grass rugby pitches.\n\nIndoors there is a 12-court sports hall, eight squash courts and a four-court sports hall. Other facilities available on the high-performance side of the centre include a hydrotherapy pool, a rehabilitation area and gym area for strength and conditioning.\n\nA 160-bed hotel is to be located on the site, to open in 2017.\n\nOther indoor football facilities in Scotland: \n\n"}

Overthrows usually occur when a fielder aims unsuccessfully at the stumps in an attempt to run out a batsman, although sometimes they are due to handling errors by the fielder receiving the ball.\n\nRuns scored in this manner are counted in addition to any runs already scored before the fielding error took place, and are credited to the batsman. If the ball reaches the boundary as a result of an overthrow then the four runs for the boundary is added to the number of completed runs before the overthrow, which can lead to the unusual event of a batsman scoring more than six runs off a single ball. There have been at least four instances in Test cricket of eight runs being scored off a single ball. The most recent was by Andrew Symonds for Australia against New Zealand at Brisbane in November 2008, when the batsmen managed to run four runs before the ball was thrown back over the wicket keeper's head for a four-run boundary.\n\nIt is possible for the ball to be thrown over more than once from the same ball, leading to even more runs being scored. In theory there is therefore no limit to how many runs may be scored off a single ball.\n"}
{"id": "19723982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19723982", "title": "Parachuting", "text": "Parachuting\n\nParachuting, or skydiving, is a method of transiting from a high point to Earth with the aid of gravity, involving the control of speed during the descent with the use of a parachute or parachutes. It may involve more or less free-falling which is a period when the parachute has not yet been deployed and the body gradually accelerates to terminal velocity.\n\nThe first parachute jump in history was made by André-Jacques Garnerin, the inventor of the parachute, on 22 October 1797. Garnerin tested his contraption by leaping from a hydrogen balloon above Paris. Garnerin's parachute bore little resemblance to today's parachutes, however, as it was not packed into any sort of container and did not feature a ripcord. The first intentional freefall jump with a ripcord-operated deployment was not made until over a century later by Leslie Irvin in 1919. While Georgia Broadwick made an earlier freefall in 1914 when her static line became entangled with her jump aircraft's tail assembly, her freefall descent was not planned. Broadwick cut her static line and deployed her parachute manually, only as a means of freeing herself from the aircraft to which she had become entangled.\n\nThe military developed parachuting technology as a way to save aircrews from emergencies aboard balloons and aircraft in flight, and later as a way of delivering soldiers to the battlefield. Early competitions date back to the 1930s, and it became an international sport in 1952.\n\nParachuting is performed as a recreational activity and a competitive sport, widely considered an extreme sport due to the risks involved. Modern militaries utilize parachuting for the deployment of airborne forces and supplies, and special operations forces commonly employ parachuting, especially free-fall parachuting, as a method of insertion. Occasionally forest firefighters, known as \"smokejumpers\" in the United States, use parachuting as a means of rapidly inserting themselves near forest fires in especially remote or otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\nManually exiting an aircraft and parachuting to safety has been widely used by aviators (especially military aviators and aircrew), and passengers to escape an aircraft that could not otherwise land safely. While this method of escape is relatively rare in modern times, it was commonly used in World War I by military aviators, and utilized extensively throughout the air wars of World War II. In modern times, the most common means of escape from an aircraft in distress is via an ejection seat. Said system is usually operated by the pilot, aircrew member, or passenger, by engaging an activation device manually. In most designs, this will lead to the seat being propelled out of and away from the aircraft carrying the occupant with it, by means of either an explosive charge or a rocket propulsion system. Once clear of the aircraft, the ejection seat will deploy a parachute, although some older models entrusted this step to manual activation by the seat's occupant.\n\nDespite the perception of danger, fatalities are relatively rare. In the U.S. during the 1970's, the sport averaged 42.5 fatalities annually. In the 80's, the average dropped to 34.1, and in the 90's, the average decreased to 32.3 deaths per year. Between 2000 and 2009, the average dropped to 25.8 and over the eight years after 2009, the annual average declined to 22.4 fatalities (roughly 0.0075 fatalities per 1,000 jumps). In 2017, members of one organization, the United States Parachute Association (USPA) reported 2,585 skydiving injuries sufficiently severe to require resort to a medical care facility.\n\nIn the US and in most of the western world, skydivers are required to carry two parachutes. The reserve parachute must be periodically inspected and re-packed (whether used or not) by a certified parachute rigger (in the US, an FAA certificated parachute rigger every 180 days). Many skydivers use an automatic activation device (AAD) that opens the reserve parachute at a pre-determined altitude if it detects that the skydiver is still in free fall. Depending on the country, AADs are often mandatory for new jumpers, and/or required for all jumpers regardless of their experience level. Most skydivers wear a visual altimeter, and an increasing number also use audible altimeters fitted to their helmets.\n\nInjuries and fatalities occurring under a fully functional parachute usually happen because the skydiver performed unsafe maneuvers or made an error in judgment while flying their canopy, typically resulting in a high-speed impact with the ground or other hazards on the ground. One of the most common sources of injury is a low turn under a high-performance canopy and while swooping. Swooping is the advanced discipline of gliding at high-speed parallel to the ground during landing.\n\nChanging wind conditions are another risk factor. In conditions of strong winds and turbulence during hot days, the parachutist can be caught in downdrafts close to the ground. Shifting winds can cause a crosswind or downwind landing which have a higher potential for injury due to the wind speed adding to the landing speed.\n\nAnother risk factor is that of \"canopy collisions\", or collisions between two or more skydivers under fully inflated parachutes. Canopy collisions can cause the jumpers' inflated parachutes to entangle with each other, often resulting in a sudden collapse (deflation) of one or more of the involved parachutes. When this occurs, the jumpers often must quickly perform emergency procedures (if there is sufficient altitude to do so) to \"cut-away\" (jettison) from their main canopies and deploy their reserve canopies. Canopy collisions are particularly dangerous when occurring at altitudes too low to allow the jumpers adequate time to safely jettison their main parachutes and fully deploy their reserve parachutes.\n\nEquipment failure rarely causes fatalities and injuries. Approximately one in 750 deployments of a main parachute result in a malfunction. Ram-air parachutes typically spin uncontrollably when malfunctioning, and must be jettisoned before deploying the reserve parachute. Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently; they are also designed more conservatively and built and tested to more exacting standards so they are more reliable than main parachutes, but the real safety advantage comes from the probability of an unlikely main malfunction multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction. This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction although the possibility of a main malfunction that cannot be cutaway causing a reserve malfunction is a very real risk.\n\nParachuting disciplines such as BASE jumping or those that involve equipment such as wingsuit flying and sky surfing have a higher risk factor due to the lower mobility of the jumper and the greater risk of entanglement. For this reason, these disciplines are generally practiced by experienced jumpers.\n\nDepictions in commercial films – notably Hollywood action movies – usually overstate the dangers of the sport. Often, the characters in such films are shown performing feats that are physically impossible without special effects assistance. In other cases, their practices would cause them to be grounded or shunned at any safety-conscious drop zone or club. USPA member drop zones in the US and Canada are required to have an experienced jumper act as a \"safety officer\" (in Canada DSO – Drop Zone Safety Officer; in the U.S. S&TA – Safety and Training Advisor) who is responsible for dealing with jumpers who violate rules, regulations, or otherwise act in a fashion deemed unsafe by the appointed individual.\n\nIn many countries, either the local regulations or the liability-conscious prudence of the drop zone owners require that parachutists must have attained the age of majority before engaging in the sport.\n\nThe first skydive performed without a parachute was by stuntman Gary Connery on 23 May 2012 at 732 m.\n\nDue to the hazardous nature of skydiving, the greatest of precautions are taken to avoid parachuting injuries and death. For first time solo-parachutists, this includes anywhere from 4 to 8 hours of ground instruction. Since the majority of parachute injuries occur upon landing (approximately 85%), the greatest emphasis within ground training is usually on the proper parachute landing fall (PLF), which seeks to orient the body as to evenly disperse the impact through flexion of several large, insulating muscles (such as the medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, biceps femoris, and semitendinosus ), as opposed to individual bones, tendons, and ligaments which break and tear more easily.\n\nParachutists, especially those flying smaller sport canopies, often land with dangerous amounts of kinetic energy, and for this reason, improper landings are the cause of more than 30% of all skydiving related injuries and deaths. Often, injuries sustained during parachute landing are caused when a single outstretched limb, such as a hand or foot, is extended separately from the rest of the body, causing it to sustain forces disproportional to the support structures within. This tendency is displayed in the accompanying chart, which shows the significantly higher proportion of wrist and ankle injuries among the 186 injured in a 110,000 parachute jump study.\n\nDue to the possibility of fractures (commonly occurring on the tibia and the ankle mortise), it is recommended that parachutists wear supportive footwear. Supportive footwear prevents inward and outward ankle rolling, allowing the PLF to safely transfer impact energy through the true ankle joint, and dissipate it via the medial gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles.\n\nParachuting in poor weather, especially with thunderstorms, high winds, and dust devils can be a dangerous activity. Reputable drop zones will suspend normal operations during inclement weather. In the United States, the USPA's Basic Safety Requirements prohibit solo student skydivers from jumping in winds exceeding 14 mph while using ram-air equipment. However, maximum ground winds are unlimited for licensed skydivers.\n\nAs parachuting is an aviation activity under the visual flight rules, it is generally illegal to jump in or through clouds, according to the relevant rules governing the airspace, such as FAR105 in the US or \"Faldskærmsbestemmelser\" (\"Parachuting Ordinances\") in Denmark. Jumpers and pilots of the dropping aircraft similarly bear responsibility of following the other VFR elements, in particular ensuring that the air traffic at the moment of jump does not create a hazard.\n\nA collision with another canopy is a statistical hazard, and may be avoided by observing simple principles, including knowing upper wind speeds, the number of party members and exit groups, and having sufficient exit separation between jumpers. In 2013, 17% of all skydiving fatalities in the United States resulted from mid-air collisions.\n\nSkydiving can be practised without jumping. Vertical wind tunnels are used to practise for free fall (\"indoor skydiving\" or \"bodyflight\"), while virtual reality parachute simulators are used to practise parachute control.\n\nBeginning skydivers seeking training have the following options:\n\n\nAt a sport skydiver's deployment altitude, the individual manually deploys a small pilot-chute which acts as a drogue, catching air and pulling out the main parachute or the main canopy. There are two principal systems in use: the \"throw-out\", where the skydiver pulls a toggle attached to the top of the pilot-chute stowed in a small pocket outside the main container: and the \"pull-out\", where the skydiver pulls a small pad attached to the pilot-chute which is stowed inside the container.\n\nThrow-out pilot-chute pouches are usually positioned at the bottom of the container – the B.O.C. deployment system – but older harnesses often have leg-mounted pouches. The latter are safe for flat-flying, but often unsuitable for freestyle or head-down flying.\n\nIn a typical civilian sport parachute system, the pilot-chute is connected to a line known as the \"bridle\", which in turn is attached to a small deployment bag that contains the folded parachute and the canopy suspension lines, which are stowed with rubber bands. At the bottom of the container that holds the deployment bag is a closing loop which, during packing, is fed through the grommets of the four flaps that are used to close the container. At that point, a curved pin that is attached to the bridle is inserted through the closing loop. The next step involves folding the pilot-chute and placing it in a pouch (e.g., B.O.C pouch).\n\nActivation begins when the pilot-chute is thrown out. It inflates and creates drag, pulling the pin out of the closing loop and allowing the pilot-chute to pull the deployment bag from the container. The parachute lines are pulled loose from the rubber bands and extend as the canopy starts to open. A rectangular piece of fabric called the \"slider\" (which separates the parachute lines into four main groups fed through grommets in the four respective corners of the slider) slows the opening of the parachute and works its way down until the canopy is fully open and the slider is just above the head of the skydiver. The slider slows and controls the deployment of the parachute. Without a slider, the parachute would inflate fast, potentially damaging the parachute fabric and/or suspension lines, as well as causing discomfort, injury or even death of the jumper. During a normal deployment, a skydiver will generally experience a few seconds of intense deceleration, in the realm of 3 to 4 g, while the parachute slows the descent from to approximately 28 km/h (17 mph).\n\nIf a skydiver experiences a malfunction of their main parachute which they cannot correct, they pull a \"cut-away\" handle on the front right-hand side of their harness (on the chest) which will release the main canopy from the harness/container. Once free from the malfunctioning main canopy, the reserve canopy can be activated manually by pulling a second handle on the front left harness. Some containers are fitted with a connecting line from the main to reserve parachutes – known as a reserve static line (RSL) – which pulls open the reserve container faster than a manual release could. Whichever method is used, a spring-loaded pilot-chute then extracts the reserve parachute from the upper half of the container.\n\nOne example of this is \"Hit and Rock\", a variant of accuracy landing devised to let people of varying skill levels compete for fun. \"Hit and Rock\" is originally from POPS (Parachutists Over Phorty Society). The object is to land as close as possible to the chair, remove the parachute harness, sprint to the chair, sit fully in the chair and rock back and forth at least one time. The contestant is timed from the moment that feet touch the ground until that first rock is completed. This event is considered a race.\n\nAngle Flying was presented for the first time in 2000 at the World Freestyle Competitions, the European Espace Boogie, and the Eloy Freefly Festival.\n\nThe technique consists of flying diagonally with a determinate relation between angle and trajectory speed of the body, to obtain an air stream that allows for control of flight. The aim is to fly in formation at the same level and angle, and to be able to perform different aerial games, such as freestyle, three-dimensional flight formation with grip, or acrobatic free-flying.\n\nClassic accuracy is running with opened parachute, in individual or team contest. The aim is to touch down on a target whose center is 2 cm in diameter. The target can be a deep foam mattress or an air-filled landing pad. \nAn electronic recording pad of 32 cm in diameter is set in the middle. It measures score in 1 cm increments up to 16 cm and displays result just after landing.\n\nThe first part of any competition take place over 8 rounds. Then in the individual competition, after this 8 selective rounds, the top 25% jump a semi-final round. After semi-final round, the top 50% are selected for the final round.\nThe competitor with the lowest cumulative score is declared the winner.\n\nCompetitors jump in teams of 5 maximum, exiting the aircraft at 1000 or 1200 meters and opening their parachutes sequentially to allow each competitor a clear approach to the target.\n\nThis sport is unpredictable because weather conditions play a very important part. So classic accuracy requires high adaptability to aerology and excellent steering control.\n\nIt is also the most interesting discipline for spectator due to the closeness of action (a few metres) and the possibility to be practised everywhere (sport ground, stadium, urban place...).\nToday, classic accuracy is the most practiced (in competition) discipline of skydiving in the world.\n\nA Canopy Relative Work, or CREW jump for short (also known as Canopy Formation flying), is a skydive where the participants open their parachutes very quickly after leaving the aircraft with the intention of flying in close proximity to each other. The goal is to create various formations by \"docking\" with other parachutists on the jump. The dock is often accomplished by placing ones feet into the lines of another person's parachute. Formations require at least 2 people, but can have many more.\n\nDue to the close proximity of the canopies, care has to be taken by all participants to ensure the safety of the jump. It is common for a CREW jumper to carry a hook knife to use in case they become entangled in another jumpers lines.\n\nA cross-country jump is a skydive where the participants open their parachutes immediately after jumping, with the intention of covering as much ground under canopy as possible. Usual distance from jump run to the dropzone can be as much as several miles.\nThere are two variations of a cross-country jump:\n\nThe more popular one is to plan the exit point upwind of the drop zone. A map and information about the wind direction and velocity at different altitudes are used to determine the exit point. This is usually set at a distance from where all the participants should be able to fly back to the drop zone.\n\nThe other variation is to jump out directly above the drop zone and fly down wind as far as possible. This increases the risks of the jump substantially, as the participants must be able to find a suitable landing area before they run out of altitude.\n\nTwo-way radios and cell-phones are often used to make sure everyone has landed safely, and, in case of a landing off the drop zone, to find out where the parachutist is so that ground crew can pick them up.\n\nFormation Skydiving (FS) was born in California, USA during the 1960s. The first documented skydiving formation occurred over Arvin, California in March 1964 when Mitch Poteet, Don Henderson, Andy Keech and Lou Paproski successfully formed a 4-man star formation, photographed by Bob Buquor. This discipline was formerly referred to in the skydiving community as Relative Work, often abbreviated to RW, Relly or Rel.\n\nParachuting is not always restricted to daytime hours; experienced skydivers sometimes perform night jumps. For safety reasons, this requires more equipment than a usual daytime jump and in most jurisdictions, it requires both an advanced skydiving license (at least a B-License in the U.S.) and a meeting with the local safety official covering who will be doing what on the load. A lit altimeter (preferably accompanied with an audible altimeter) is a must. Skydivers performing night jumps often take flashlights up with them so that they can check their canopies have properly deployed.\n\nVisibility to other skydivers and other aircraft is also a consideration; FAA regulations require skydivers jumping at night to be wearing a light visible for three miles (5 km) in every direction, and to turn it on once they are under canopy. A chem-light(glowstick) is a good idea on a night jump.\n\nNight jumpers should be made aware of the dark zone, when landing at night. Above 30 meters (100 feet) jumpers flying their canopy have a good view of the landing zone normally because of reflected ambient light/moon light. Once they get close to the ground, this ambient light source is lost, because of the low angle of reflection. The lower they get, the darker the ground looks. At about 100 feet and below it may seem that they are landing in a black hole. Suddenly it becomes very dark, and the jumper hits the ground soon after. This ground rush should be explained to, and anticipated by, the first time night jumper. Recommendations should be made to the jumper to utilize a canopy that is larger than they typically use on a day jump and to attempt to schedule their first night jump as close to a full moon as possible to make it easier to see the ground.\n\nWhile more dangerous than regular skydiving and more difficult to schedule, two night jumps are required by the USPA for a jumper to obtain their D (expert) license.\n\nPond swooping is a form of competitive parachuting wherein canopy pilots attempt to touch down and glide across a small body of water, and onto the shore. Events provide lighthearted competition, rating accuracy, speed, distance and style. Points and peer approval are reduced when a participant \"chows\", or fails to reach shore and sinks into the water. Swoop ponds are not deep enough to drown in under ordinary circumstances, their main danger being from the concussive force of an incorrectly executed maneuver. In order to gain distance, swoopers increase their speed by executing a \"hook turn\", wherein both speed and difficulty increase with the angle of the turn. Hook turns are most commonly measured in increments of 90 degrees. As the angle of the turn increases, both horizontal and vertical speed are increased, such that a misjudgement of altitude or imprecise manipulation of the canopy's control structures (front risers, rear risers, and toggles) can lead to a high speed impact with the pond or Earth. Prevention of injury is the main reason why a pond is used for swooping rather than a grass landing area.\n\nThis is when skydivers have a ball which weighs 455–590 grams and release it in free fall. The ball maintains the same fall rate as the skydivers. The skydivers can pass the ball around to each other whilst in free fall. At a predetermined altitude, the \"ball master\" will catch the ball and hold on to it to ensure it does not impact the ground. Space balls are prohibited at many drop zones, due to risk to persons and property on the ground in the event that the ball is not caught or dropped during/after deployment\n\nStyle can be considered as sprint of parachuting. This individual discipline is played in free fall.\n\nThe idea is to take maximum speed and complete a pre-designated series of maneuvers as fast and cleanly as possible (speed can exceed 400 km/h / 250 mph)\n\nJumps are filmed using a ground-based camera (with an exceptional lens to record the performance).\n\nPerformance is timed (from the start of the maneuver until its completion) and then judged in public at the end of the jump.\nCompetition includes 4 qualifying rounds and a final for the top 8. \nCompetitors jump from a height of 2200 m to 2500 m.\n\nThey rush into an acceleration stage for 15 to 20 seconds and then run their series of maneuvers benefiting to the maximum of the stored speed.\n\nThose series consist of Turns and Back-Loops to achieve in a pre-designated order. The incorrect performance of the maneuvers gives rise to penalties that are added at runtime.\n\nThe performance of the athlete is defined in seconds and hundredths of a second.\nThe competitor with the lowest cumulative time is declared the winner.\n\nNotice the complete sequence is performed by leading international experts in just over 6 seconds, penalties included.\n\nThanks to large unpopulated areas to jump over, 'stuff' jumps become possible. These jumps consist of skydivers leaving the aircraft with some object. Rubber raft jumps are popular; where the jumpers sit in a rubber raft. Cars, bicycles, motorcycles, vacuum cleaners, water tanks, and inflatable companions have also been thrown out the back of an aircraft. At a certain altitude, the jumpers break off from the object and deploy their parachutes, leaving it to smash into the ground at terminal velocity.\n\nA tradition at many drop zones is the swoop and chug. As parachutists land from the last load of the day, other skydivers often hand the landing skydivers a beer that is customarily chugged in the landing area. This is sometimes timed as a friendly competition but is usually an informal, untimed, kick-off for the night's festivities.\n\nTracking is where skydivers take a body position to achieve a high forward speed, allowing them to cover a great distance over the ground. Tracking is also used at the end of group jumps to achieve separation from other jumpers before parachute deployment. The tracking position involves sweeping the arms out to the side of the body and straightening the legs with the toes pointed.\n\nUsing a vertical wind tunnel to simulate free fall has become a discipline of its own and is not only used for training but has its own competitions, teams, and figures.\n\n'Wingsuit flying' or 'wingsuiting' is the sport of flying through the air using a wingsuit, which adds surface area to the human body to enable a significant increase in lift. The common type of wingsuit creates an extra surface area with fabric between the legs and under the arms.\n\nNational parachuting associations exist in many countries, many affiliated with the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), to promote their sport. In most cases, national representative bodies, as well as local drop zone operators, require that participants carry certification attesting to their training their level of experience in the sport, and their proven competence. Anyone who cannot produce such bona-fides is treated as a student, requiring close supervision.\n\nThe sole organization in the United States is the United States Parachute Association (USPA), which issues licenses and ratings, governs skydiving, publishes Parachutist Magazine, and represents skydiving to government agencies. USPA publishes the Skydivers Information Manual (SIM) and many other resources. In Canada, the Canadian Sport Parachuting Association is the lead organization. In South Africa, the sport is managed by the Parachute Association of South Africa, and in the United Kingdom by the British Parachute Association. In Brazil the CNP (Centro Nacional de Paraquedismo) sets in Boituva, where many records have been broken and where it is known for being the 2nd largest center in the world and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nWithin the sport, associations promote safety, technical advances, training-and-certification, competition and other interests of their members. Outside their respective communities, they promote their sport to the public and often intercede with government regulators.\n\nCompetitions are organized at regional, national and international levels in most these disciplines. Some of them offer amateur competition.\n\nMany of the more photogenic/videogenic variants also enjoy sponsored events with prize money for the winners.\n\nThe majority of jumpers tend to be non-competitive, enjoying the opportunity to skydive with their friends on weekends and holidays. The atmosphere of their gatherings is relaxed, sociable and welcoming to newcomers. Skydiving events, called \"boogies\", are arranged at local, national and international scale each year, which attracting both young jumpers and their elders – Parachutists Over Phorty (POPs), Skydivers Over Sixty (SOS) and even older groups.\n\nIn parachuting, a drop zone or DZ is most technically the area above and around a location where a parachutist freefalls and expects to land. In common use it often refers to the totality of a skydiving operation (a business). And the area wherein parachutists land will be referred to as the \"landing area.\" The drop zone is usually situated beside a small airport, often sharing the facility with other general aviation activities. Drop zone staff may include the DZO (drop zone operator or owner), manifest, pilots, instructors, coaches, cameramen, packers, riggers and other general staff.\n\nCosts in the sport are not trivial. As new technological advances or performance enhancements are introduced, equipment tends to increase in price. Similarly, the average skydiver carries more equipment than in earlier years, with safety devices (such as an AAD) contributing to a significant portion of the cost.\nA full set of brand-new equipment can easily cost as much as a new motorcycle or half a small car. The market is not large enough to permit the steady lowering of prices that is seen with some other equipment like computers.\nA new main canopy for the experienced parachutist can cost between $2,000 and $3,000 US Higher performance and Tandem Parachutes cost significantly more, whilst large docile student parachutes often cost less.\n\nMost parachuting equipment is ruggedly designed and is enjoyed by several owners before being retired. A rigger is trained to spot signs of damage or misuse. Riggers also keep track of industry product and safety bulletins, and can, therefore, determine if a piece of equipment is up-to-date and serviceable.\n\n\n\n\nSkydive locations The Netherlands\n"}

Located close to Perth's central business district, the stadium currently has a maximum capacity of 20,500 people for sporting events and 25,000 people for concerts, with the ground's record attendance of 32,000 people set during an Ed Sheeran concert in 2015. The land on which the stadium was built was made a public reserve in 1904, with the main ground developed several years later.\n\nPerth Oval was the home ground of the East Perth Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) from 1910 until 2002, and hosted several of the competition's grand finals during that time. In 2004, the ground was redeveloped, altering it from an oval field to a rectangular field. The ground is currently home to two major professional sporting clubs: Perth Glory FC, a soccer team competing in the A-League, and the Western Force, a rugby union team competing in the Global Rapid Rugby competition. The ground is also used by the WA Reds, a semi-professional rugby league team competing in the S. G. Ball Cup, as well as for concerts.\n\nThe stadium is currently used for hosting sports events and concerts.\n\nIn sports mode the stadium has a capacity of around 20,500. Soccer club Perth Glory has played at the ground since 1996. The stadium is unusual among modern Australian stadiums for having a standing terrace at the northern end of the ground, called 'The Shed'. A breakaway group from the vocal supporters of the Perth Glory 'Shed', named 'Glory Fans United', are now situated in the Southern Stand.\n\nThe ground has hosted rugby union team Western Force since 2010. The Force's move to the stadium led to a minor redevelopment of facilities at the ground, including an increase in capacity and improved lighting.\n\nFor 2008 the stadium hosted WA Reds home matches in the Bundaberg Red Cup.\n\nSince 2009, there have been annual NRL games played at the oval, generally as South Sydney Rabbitohs home games, with the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles joining in 2016. The stadium has housed the administrative facilities of the Western Australia Rugby League since 2003.\n\nIn 2015, the stadium hosted a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier between the Australia and Bangladesh, the first A-international in Perth in over a decade.\n\nThe capacity for concerts is now over 25,000. A record 32,000 crowd attended the Ed Sheeran concert in 2015.\n\nThe land on which the stadium is built was known as Loton's Paddock after the previous owner William Loton, Lord Mayor of Perth. The Paddock had been reclaimed from part of Stone's Lake, which was part of a lake system known as The Great Lakes District which included Lake Monger and Herdsman Lake.\n\nLoton sold the land to the City of Perth in 1904 with the purpose of providing recreation for the residents of the area. After the 2004 redevelopment, part of the ground reverted to public open space and the original name, Loton Park was re-applied, to honour Loton, and Yoordgoorading as a reference to the original Indigenous inhabitants of the land.\n\nIn the early 1930s large white entry gates were built on the north west corner of the ground. These have since been heritage listed.\n\nSoccer was an early tenant at Loton Park, playing regular matches as early as 1903, when over 2,000 spectators attended a Charity Cup match between Olympic FC and Civil Service.\n\nIn 1905 the land was offered to the WA British Football Association for £2000, but the asking price was considered too high.\n\nPerth Oval was the scene of a humiliation in 1927 when the WA State team were thrashed 11–3 by Bohemians, a team representing Czechoslovakia.\n\nPrior to the 2004 redevelopment, Perth Oval was oval-shaped, and when Perth Glory FC entered the NSL in 1996, temporary stands were moved onto the pitch to get supporters closer to the action. After playing in these conditions for four years, it became apparent that the Glory would need their own rectangular stadium and after Glory's proposed redevelopment of Leederville Oval was rejected, the Town of Vincent completely overhauled the ground into a rectangular stadium.\n\nPerth Glory are now major tenants of this stadium and continue play their home games at Perth Oval.\nPerth Oval also hosted the 2014 W-League Semi-Final and Grand Final matches involving Perth Glory Women.\n\n2015 saw the return of the Socceroos to Perth after a 10-year absence, with a 5–0 2018 FIFA World Cup Qualifier win against Bangladesh on 3 September, in front of a 19,495-strong crowd. The following year on 1 September the Socceroos returned for another World Cup Qualifier against Iraq, with 18,923 in attendance.\n\nAustralian rules football club East Perth Football Club moved to Perth Oval from Wellington Square in 1910, and played at the ground until 1999 except in 1940 due to a dispute with the Perth City Council over rents, and in 1988 and 1989 when the WAFL attempted an unsuccessful move to the WACA. After the Royals played their last match at the ground, they permanently moved away in 2003.\n\nIn 1956 the F.D. Book Stand was built as part of East Perth Football Club’s golden jubilee celebrations. It was named after administrator Fred Book, who was instrumental in ensuring Perth Oval stayed as a sporting ground during World War II.\n\nThe ground was briefly used as a home base for East Perth's WAFL rivals West Perth and Perth. Six West Australian Football League Grand Finals were played at Perth Oval, the first being in 1912 and the last in 1935.\n\nPerth Oval was home to Western Australian Grade Cricket teams North Perth and University. North Perth played at the oval between 1910 and 1975 and University between 1913 and 1929.\n\nRugby was played at Perth Oval as early as 1905.\n\nThe ground has occasionally been used by the Western Australian Rugby Union to host state league finals matches at least as far back as 1940.\n\nPerth Spirit played at Perth Oval during the 2007 Australian Rugby Championship.\n\nSince 2010 the Western Force have called Perth Oval home and together with co-tenants Perth Glory, helped instigate the stadium's most recent re-development.\n\nRugby league has been an annual fixture at nib stadium since 2009, with South Sydney Rabbitohs hosting a home game once a season with the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles joining them from 2016 onwards. The biggest crowds have occurred in games involving the New Zealand Warriors. It was announced in January 2016 that the stadium would host Perth's first rugby league test match between the Australian Kangaroos and the New Zealand Kiwis on 15 October 2016.\n\nIt was also selected as a venue for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup.\n\nList of rugby league test matches played at the Perth Oval.\nThe first game played at the venue was in the 1997 Super League season. The Perth-based Western Reds moved their round 4 game against the Canterbury Bulldogs to the oval due to the unavailability of their usual home ground, the WACA. On that occasion the Reds won 36–6 in what was the venue's smallest rugby league attendance (until 2017) of 7,135.\n\nThe record crowd for the ground is 32,000 for the Ed Sheeran concert on 2 December 2015, overtaking the previous record of 31,997 for the last Foo Fighters concert in 2015.\n\nThe record sport attendance is 27,473, for an interstate Australian football match between Western Australia and Victoria on 6 July 1929 – which was at the time the record football crowd in Western Australian history. The highest crowd for a club match was 26,760 for the 31 May 1969 derby Australian football match between East Perth and West Perth.\n\nThe record football crowd for a match at the ground is 19,495, for a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier between the Socceroos and Bangladesh, bettering the previous record of 18,067 in the 1998–99 NSL season game between Perth Glory and South Melbourne FC.\n\nThe record rugby union crowd at the venue prior to the 2012-13 redevelopment is an estimated 22,000 in a Super Rugby 2011 Season game between the Western Force and Crusaders on 30 April 2011.\n\nThe record sports crowd at the venue since the 2012-13 redevelopment is 20,727 in a 2015 NRL season game between the South Sydney Rabbitohs and New Zealand Warriors on 6 June 2015.\n\nnib Stadium has been the venue of major music concerts, including:\n\n"}

{"id": "772534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=772534", "title": "Providence Park", "text": "Providence Park\n\nProvidence Park (formerly Jeld-Wen Field; PGE Park; Civic Stadium; originally Multnomah Stadium; and from 1893 until the stadium was built, Multnomah Field) is an outdoor sports venue in the northwest United States, located in the Goose Hollow neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It has existed in rudimentary form since 1893, and as a complete stadium since 1926.\n\nThe MLS Portland Timbers and NWSL Portland Thorns FC soccer teams use the facility as their home pitch, as do the PDL's Timbers U23s. The NCAA Division I FCS Portland State Vikings football team uses the park during the Big Sky season. The stadium has been host to several major sporting events including Soccer Bowl '77, the 1999 and 2003 FIFA Women's World Cups, the 2009 Triple-A All-Star Game, the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, the 2014 MLS All-Star Game and the 2015 NWSL Championship Game. The stadium capacity will be expanded with 4,000 new seats within the next years.\n\nOriginally, the park was owned by the Multnomah Athletic Club and used by their amateur sports teams. In the 1950s, the PCL Portland Beavers baseball team moved out of Vaughn Street Park into what was then known as \"Multnomah Stadium.\" In 1966, the city purchased the stadium and renamed it \"Civic Stadium.\" It was renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Beavers, who had not played at the park since the early 1990s. The naming rights of the stadium were purchased by Portland General Electric and it was renamed \"PGE Park.\" In 2010, the park underwent renovations again, this time so it could accommodate the Portland Timbers MLS franchise and a year later the rights to the stadiums name were sold, this time to Jeld-Wen. In 2014, the name was changed again to \"Providence Park\" after Providence Health & Services bought the naming rights. The stadium sits on a rectangular block bounded by Southwest Morrison Street, Southwest 18th Avenue, the Multnomah Athletic Club building and Southwest Salmon Street, and Southwest 20th Avenue.\n\nProvidence Park is an outdoor stadium which houses the MLS Portland Timbers, NWSL Portland Thorns, and Portland State University Vikings football. The stadium underwent a $31 million renovation in late 2010 and early 2011. The stadium is owned by the City of Portland, and is managed by Peregrine Sports, LLC, the entity that owns the Timbers and Thorns.\n\nPrior to the 2011 MLS season, the stadium was renamed Jeld-Wen Field from PGE Park, in a partnership with Klamath Falls, Oregon based company Jeld-Wen. Jeld-Wen is a manufacturer of windows and doors, leading to the stadium's nickname, \"The House of Pane.\" In 2014, the stadium was renamed Providence Park after a partnership with Providence Health & Services was announced.\n\nThe Multnomah Athletic Club, an athletic club in downtown Portland, stands next door; the windows of the north side of the club's building overlook the field.\n\nThe Interstate 405 freeway in Portland is also known locally as the Stadium Freeway and travels near the stadium. In addition, the Providence Park MAX Light Rail station is across the street. The property slopes significantly downhill from the south end to the north end, with the result that the playing surface sits well below street level, the elevation at street level is approximately above sea level.\n\nThe stadium is currently home to the Portland Timbers of MLS, Portland Thorns FC of NWSL, and is also used for several Portland State University Vikings football home games each season.\n\nThe Portland Beavers minor league baseball team of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) had played some games at Multnomah Field during 1905 when their Vaughn Street Park was temporarily reconfigured to host a track and field event. They moved into Multnomah Stadium in 1956 after over a half century at Vaughn Street, a wooden ballpark which was soon demolished. The sod from the baseball field at Vaughn Street was transferred to the new venue; Civic Stadium installed artificial turf in 1969.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1977 the independent Portland Mavericks of the Northwest League played their home games at the stadium. Actor Kurt Russell was an infielder for the Mavericks. The Beavers returned to Portland in 1978 until 1993 when they were moved out of the city again. The Class A Portland Rockies were established in 1995 and played at the park until 2000 when they were moved and renamed the Tri-City Dust Devils. In 2001, the Albuquerque Dukes were moved to Portland and renamed the \"Beavers\" marking the third time the franchise would occupy the park for their home games.\n\nAs a baseball venue, the stadium had an unorthodox south-southeast alignment, with home plate in the northwest corner (20th and Morrison) of the property.\n\nAfter it was announced that Major League Soccer was moving a franchise to Providence Park (then known as PGE Park) the Beavers baseball team had to start looking for a new stadium. However, the plan never came to fruition and team owner Merritt Paulson put the Beavers up for sale. The club's major-league parent, the San Diego Padres, purchased the team, which moved to Tucson, Arizona as the Tucson Padres. The team played its final game at the stadium on September 6, 2010.\n\nThe stadium hosted the USFL's Portland Breakers, as well as the Portland Storm and Portland Thunder of the WFL.\n\nSoccer has been hosted at Providence Park since the original Portland Timbers were founded in the original North American Soccer League in 1975. Various iterations of the team have called the stadium home, including the 1980s version in the Western Soccer Alliance and the 2000s version in the USL First Division before the MLS club was formed.\n\nSince 1893, the site had been home to Multnomah Field, which consisted of sports fields with various grandstands. The stadium was built in 1926 for $502,000, by what is now known as Multnomah Athletic Club, who named it Multnomah Civic Stadium.\nThe site was used for college football (including seven Civil War games between the University of Oregon and Oregon State University), cricket matches and greyhound racing. Well into the 1960s, most significant football games hosted by Oregon and Oregon State were held at this site because of its capacity. Oregon played in 107 games at Multnomah/Civic Stadium between 1894 and 1970. The University of Washington played all its road games against Oregon and Oregon State at Multnomah Field/Multnomah Stadium until 1966 (OSU) and 1967 (Oregon). The site also hosted the Portland Rose Festival coronation and a Fourth of July appearance by President Warren G. Harding.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Portland Beavers moved to the stadium after their original field, Vaughn Street Park, was condemned. In 1966, the Multnomah Athletic Club sold the stadium for $2.1 million to the city of Portland, which renamed it Civic Stadium.\n\nA $38.5 million renovation took place in 2001, upgrading the seating and concourse area, and adding new luxury suites and club seats. The renovation improved the structural soundness of the facility, and introduced a new sound system. The renovation also includes some retro-features, such as a manually operated baseball scoreboard. At that point, PGE bought the naming rights and it became PGE Park.\n\nIn July 2009, after attempts to both find a new home for an MLS franchise and identify a site for a new home for the Portland Beavers, the Portland City Council approved a $31 million renovation to make PGE Park ready for the 2011 Major League Soccer season, by reconfiguring the stadium primarily for soccer and football. The decision led to the departure of the Beavers.\nThe renovation was performed by Turner Construction, who served as the general contractor and also performed the 2001 renovation, and Ellerbe Becket as the primary architect. A presentation to the Portland Design Commission indicated that 5,000 seats would be added, bringing capacity to about 22,000, but with only about 18,000 available for use on a regular basis.\n\nThe renovation met Major League Soccer standards, introduced a new playing surface, which shifted west and north, and added space on the east and south sides, with new seating areas and new amenities. The Lighthouse Impact 16 main video screen was designed by Anthony James Partners and features over 74 square meters of LED video. A Lighthouse B10 pitchside display runs the length of the east side and portions of the north and south ends and is over 152 meters long. As the project was nearing completion, it was revealed to be $5 million over budget, making the total cost of the renovation $36 million. The agreement between the city and Portland Timbers owner Merritt Paulson meant that Paulson was responsible for any cost overruns larger than $1 million.\n\nThe newly renovated stadium made its début on April 14, 2011, when Major League Soccer's Timbers defeated the Chicago Fire, 4–2. The announced attendance at Timbers games in 2011 was 18,627, a sell-out.\n\nA few thousand seats were added for two games late in the 2011 season. About 2,000 seats were opened up for the 2012 season, bringing capacity up to 20,438. Following the 2012 season in which the Timbers' average attendance was 20,438, during the 2012–13 off-season the Timbers widened the pitch for the 2013 season, adding two yards on each side to achieve a width of . The team widened the pitch by another yard in 2014, for a total pitch size of .\n\nIn April 2017, the Portland Timbers unveiled a US$50 million renovation plan which would add roughly 4,000 new seats to the eastern side of the stadium. Timbers' President of Business Mike Golub stated that \"We felt it was imperative to see how we could transform the stadium and add capacity to both meet the demand that we have for tickets and also position the club to be viable and competitive for years to come\", referencing the Timbers' current season ticket waitlist of approximately 13,000. The Timbers report that the renovation will come at no cost to the City of Portland and will bring the stadium capacity to roughly 25,000. The club partnered with Portland-based Allied Works Architecture to design the expansion, and aims to begin construction in the 2017 or 2018 off-season with the goal of having the renovated stadium ready for the 2019 or 2020 MLS season.\n\nOn August 28, 1977, the stadium was site of the North American Soccer League Soccer Bowl '77 between the New York Cosmos and the Seattle Sounders, the last official game of the legendary Pelé. The Cosmos won the championship.\n\nOn September 7, 1997 the stadium hosted a World Cup soccer qualifying match between the United States men's national team and Costa Rica. A raucous capacity crowd of 27,396 saw the U.S. squad win, 1–0, on a goal by Tab Ramos in the 79th minute.\n\nThe stadium was the site of four group matches in the 1999 Women's World Cup. The stadium also hosted two group matches, two quarterfinals, and both semifinals in the 2003 Women's World Cup.\n\nOn July 1, 2009, the venue hosted the third-round match of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup between the Portland Timbers and their rivals the Seattle Sounders FC.\n\nProvidence Park hosted the 2014 MLS All-Star Game.\n\n\"Stadium known as Civic Stadium\"\n\n\"Stadium known as PGE Park\"\n\n\"Stadium known as Jeld-Wen Field\"\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Jantzen swim wear company had a 3D model of the Jantzen girl hovering overby cable over the left field wall in its baseball configuration. The Jantzen girl was in play because it was below the top of the wall and it was hit a couple of times over the years.\n\nOn May 27, 1991, the stadium received national attention when Vancouver Canadians outfielder Rodney McCray, while attempting to catch a fly ball, crashed through a wooden advertisement behind the warning track in right-center field; a real-life version of an incident in the fictional book and film, \"The Natural\". While McCray failed to make the out, he only suffered scrapes and bruises and remained in the game. Highlight reels of that play ran for weeks on cable channels such as CNN and ESPN. On August 12, 2006, the Beavers commemorated the event with a Rodney McCray Bobblehead Night, passing out bobbleheads of McCray to fans and renaming right-center field \"McCray Alley\".\n\nOn July 15, 2009, the stadium hosted the Triple-A All-Star Game, with the International League stars defeating the Pacific Coast league, 6–5. The game was attended by 16,637 fans, the largest crowd for a Triple-A All-Star game since 1991, and the third largest at the time. Portland's Chad Huffman won the Home Run Derby.\n\nOn October 27, 2007, the stadium hosted the highest-scoring game in modern NCAA football history, when the Weber State University Wildcats defeated the PSU Vikings, 73–68, a combined point total of 141 points. This point total eclipsed the previous NCAA record of 136 points, set in a 1968 Division III game, and the previous Division I record of 133 points, set in 2004. While this record lasted only two weeks, and has been surpassed three times in all, it remains the highest-scoring game involving NCAA Division I teams.\n\nOn September 2, 1957, Elvis Presley performed one of the first outdoor stadium rock concerts in music history (Presley held the first ever in Vancouver, BC, Canada just a few days earlier at Empire Stadium) there on his four-day tour of the Pacific Northwest. The concert created mass hysteria, and an estimated 14,000 people attended the concert.\n\nIn a November 8, 2013 interview with the Portland Business Journal, Portland Timbers owner Merritt Paulson expressed his desire to host summer concerts at the stadium.\n\nIn 2010, PGE Park was a filming location of Season 2 of the television series \"Leverage\". The episode depicts a fictional Massachusetts (where the series was set) minor league team also known as the Beavers.\n\nThe field has been home to a feral cat colony since approximately 1985, which may have been at the park before the current stadium opened in 1926. There are an estimated 12–19 cats in the colony, referred to as \"living rat traps\". After a construction worker killed a feral cat in 2000, the park enlisted the Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon to assist the animals during construction efforts and to run a trap-neuter-return program. The cats are discussed in Chuck Palahniuk's travelogue of Portland, \"Fugitives and Refugees\".\n\n\n"}

Australia won the match by 122 runs with minutes to spare at the end of the fifth day.\n\nThe match attained notoriety owing to the number of umpiring wrong decisions given by international umpires Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson and accusations of poor sportsmanship against both teams. The match ended in a dramatic defeat of the Indian team in the final ten minutes of the five-day match, with some commentators suggesting that the umpiring mistakes had a major impact on the course of the match. The result ensured that Australia retained the Border–Gavaskar Trophy, as well as taking Ricky Ponting's team to 16 consecutive Test wins, equalling the previous Test record, also held by Australia under Steve Waugh. The controversy was termed by parts of the media as \"Bollyline\", a reference to the 1930s controversy Bodyline. The name, a portmanteau of Bodyline and Bollywood, is tongue in cheek, but by referencing Bodyline, hints at the potential seriousness of the rift between the Indians and Australians. Indeed, according to Steve Waugh, the affair \"now has the potential to affect relations between the countries\".\n\nThe Test itself was tightly contested, setting up a fifth (final) day in which the match could have been won by either team, but was most likely to be drawn. The match featured centuries by batsmen on every day of the match. Three four-wicket hauls were achieved and Brett Lee achieved a five-wicket haul in the first innings. Both Anil Kumble and Michael Clarke were, at individual points in the game, on a hat-trick. All-rounder Andrew Symonds was at the centre of much of the action, achieving 162* and 61 with the bat and taking 3/51 in India's second innings. Symonds was awarded man of the match.\n\nControversies abounded; as well as the multiple umpiring incidents that were placed in the spotlight by the narrowness of the victory, Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh was charged with racial abuse in an altercation with Andrew Symonds. Harbhajan was banned by the match referee Mike Procter for three Test matches although the charges were downgraded on 29 January 2008 to the lesser charge of using abusive language and the ban was lifted. The Indian team had earlier protested and threatened to pull out of the tour. The match produced bitterness on both sides and an announcement by the Indian team that they would abandon their tour, followed by dramatic intervention by the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\nAustralia had won the first Test played the previous week at the Melbourne Cricket Ground by a margin of 337 runs, needing only four days to secure victory. Australia were seeking a 16th consecutive Test win to equal the record set by Steve Waugh's team between late-1999 and early-2001.\n\nThe first match had led to media consternation about the appropriateness of India's batting strategy. Rahul Dravid had been promoted up the batting order from number three to open along with Wasim Jaffer, while regular opener Dinesh Karthik was dropped prior to the first Test. This was done to create a middle-order vacancy for Yuvraj Singh, who had scored a century in India's previous Test, when he substituted for the injured Sachin Tendulkar. During the first Test, both Dravid and Jaffer failed to pass 20 in either innings, with the former attracting attention for his particularly slow and defensive approach. This allowed the Australian bowling to assert control over the Indian batsmen from the outset and prevent them from gaining the momentum at the outset. Yuvraj also failed; he was particularly fidgety in scoring 0 and 5. The failures of the rearranged line-up prompted calls for the return of Virender Sehwag, who had been taken on tour as the reserve opener. Sehwag had been dropped from the side in early-2007 and had been unproductive in recent Ranji Trophy matches in India; however, his extremely aggressive approach had been successful against Australia in the past and cricket pundits felt that he could counter-attack the Australian bowlers, rather than letting their new ball attack seize the initiative. Jaffer, Dravid and Yuvraj were all mooted as possible omissions to make way for Sehwag.\n\nAustralia fielded an unchanged XI, whereas India made one change: the injured Zaheer Khan was replaced by fellow paceman Ishant Sharma, a 19-year-old playing in his third Test match.\n\nThe match was preceded by speculation as to how attractive the play would be. The first Test was played on a pitch that was slow and somewhat irregular in behaviour, and the commentators were optimistic that the second Test would lead to more attractive batting, particularly from the Indians, who had amassed 7/705 and 2/211 in their previous outing in 2003–04. Tendulkar (148* in 1991–92, 241* in 2003–04) and V. V. S. Laxman (167 in 1999–2000, 178 in 2003–04) had both scored much-lauded Test centuries at the ground.\n\nAustralia won the toss and elected to bat on a pitch offering some moisture and grass on the first morning, but predicted to be a good batting track for days two to three and slowly develop into a spinner's track by day five. After bowling a maiden to start the day, R. P. Singh dismissed Jaques, who was trying to square cut uppishly on the back foot, for a duck. In the ninth over of the day Hayden edged Singh to the left of the wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who was off balance and left the catch to first slip Tendulkar. Australia were 2/27 with Ponting and Hussey at the crease.\n\nAn appeal for Ponting caught down the leg side by wicket-keeper Dhoni from Ganguly when he was on just 14 was turned down by umpire Mark Benson with Australia 2/55. Just prior to lunch, with Sharma hit for 10 runs off one over, the spinners Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble came into the attack. Harbhajan produced a stumping opportunity against Ponting in which the ball flicked the pad and was not gloved by Dhoni, running away for two byes. Ponting and Hussey survived to lunch with Ponting scoring a half century and Australia at 2/95.\n\nAfter lunch, Ponting began looking dangerous, scoring three fours off one R. P. Singh over before he was dismissed by Harbhajan Singh for the seventh time in his career. Australia were 3/119 at the end of the 30th over. Hussey edged the first ball of the next over to Tendulkar who took a low catch at first slip, bringing Andrew Symonds to the crease. Michael Clarke fell in the over after, not offering a shot to a straight, full ball on leg stump and being adjudged LBW, leaving Australia at 5/121. Singh soon drew an edge from Gilchrist to Tendulkar at first slip once again, who had to dive forward to take the catch. With only one specialist batsman remaining, Australia were at 6/135, with India having the clear upper hand.\n\nThe new batsman Brad Hogg played his natural attacking game while Symonds started slowly. The two batsmen put the pressure back on India and took the score to 6/193 in the 47th over, having scored 56 off the last 10 overs. In that over by Sharma, Symonds, then on 30, nicked the ball to wicketkeeper Dhoni, however Steve Bucknor deemed the batsman not out. By tea, Australia were 6/214 with Hogg on 47 and Symonds on 38.\n\nImmediately after tea, Hogg brought up his 50 with a boundary through the gully region. In the 56th over with Australia on 6/238, Symonds was given not out by the third umpire in a close stumping call when replays suggested his back foot was clearly off the ground. India's frustration increased as Symonds increased his tempo and overtook Hogg, who had stalled in the 70s. Australia's run-rate continued to rise, with singles and boundaries coming frequently. Symonds reached his century in the 70th over with Australia on 6/305 and Hogg on 78. Hogg was out two overs later, edging to Dravid at slip. Brett Lee came in and survived until the end of the day. 19-year-old Sharma was jeered by the crowd for losing his run-up three times in one over. Australia finished the day at 7/376.\n\nIndia began the day hoping to dismiss the Australian lower order quickly. A breeze had picked up speed through the ground and those bowling from the Paddington End had the advantage of running in with the breeze and bowling faster. However, Lee continued to resist, reaching 50 from 100 balls in the 98th over. Lee eventually fell five overs later for 59, leaving Australia at 8/421. Mitchell Johnson made a quick 28 from 29 balls before falling to Kumble, Stuart Clark fell two overs later and Australia were all out for 463.\n\nJaffer and Dravid began India's innings by successfully negotiating a tricky period of three overs prior to lunch. They did not score any runs in this period. Lee was controlled and bowled two short balls at Jaffer before trapping him with a low, swinging, yorker. Replays revealed that Lee had bowled a no-ball by overstepping the bowling mark, but the dismissal left India 1/8. Laxman and Dravid consolidated the fall of the early wicket and batted steadily, although Dravid survived a catch from a no-ball, this time from Johnson. Dravid was defensive while Laxman wristily pushed the ball to the cover and midwicket boundaries. At the end of the 15th over, a Johnson over that went for 19 runs, India were 1/69 and Laxman was on 45 from 31 balls.\n\nAfter his initial fast start, Laxman settled into a more sedate rate of scoring, while Dravid continued to go slowly. After one particularly long period without scoring a run, Dravid's next single was loudly greeted with ironic applause and he raised his bat to humorously acknowledge the crowd. Dravid made 55 while Laxman scored his third century in as many Tests at the SCG, but was fortunate to survive a close LBW call. The Australians took late wickets, removing both Laxman (109) and Dravid in quick succession to leave Tendulkar and Ganguly at the crease. The new pair survived to stumps with the score on 3/215.\n\nThe day started with Tendulkar and Ganguly in an aggressive mood with both batsmen lifting Brad Hogg for sixes and scoring many boundaries. Ganguly was particularly successful, reaching 67 from 78 balls before lofting Hogg to mid-off against the run of play. Tendulkar was fortunate to survive a close LBW call. When Yuvraj replaced Ganguly at the crease, India's momentum slowed as he had difficulties dealing with the second new ball, before being trapped LBW. The lunch break came soon after, and Dhoni was quickly removed by Lee as was Kumble shortly after the resumption, leaving India seven wickets down and more than a hundred runs behind. Harbhajan joined Tendulkar and scored quickly to begin with, from a series of risky shots. He then settled down and began batting in a more orthodox manner, providing steady support to Tendulkar. Harbhajan and Tendulkar passed their half-century and century respectively after the tea break, as the eighth wicket partnership passed 100. It was after Harbhajan passed 50 that his altercation with Symonds occurred, leading umpire Benson to speak to Harbhajan. Harbhajan was then dismissed and India surpassed Australia's total. Singh and Sharma then scored 13 and 23 respectively before India were bowled out. Tendulkar finished with 154 not out and raised some eyebrows for continually taking the single from the first ball of the over and handing the strike to Singh and Sharma, the latter of whom had previously only scored 17 runs at Test level. India had a 68-run lead. Hayden and Jaques were unbeaten at stumps, having survived five overs.\n\nAustralia started the day slowly as the Indian pace pair of R. P. Singh and Sharma bowled accurately. After a short rain delay, the Australians began to seize the initiative and soon wiped out their first innings deficit. Approaching lunch, Jaques was out to Kumble after a lofted sweep went to the fielder on the fence. Ponting came to the crease but was caught at silly point off the first ball he faced from Harbhajan, sparking major celebrations among the Indians, including two half-commando rolls from Harbhajan. After lunch, Hayden and Hussey rebuilt Australia's innings with the former scoring another hundred. Ponting acted as his runner due to an injury he collected while batting. Hayden was eventually dismissed by Kumble for 123 while attempting a reverse sweep. The very next ball Kumble claimed Clarke for a golden duck. On a hat trick, Kumble hit Symonds on the pads sparking a loud appeal which was turned down. Symonds and Hussey saw Australia to stumps with a healthy lead.\n\nAustralia started the final day at a slower rate than had been expected. Hussey went on to make his first century against India and finished the innings on 145 not out. Symonds also scored a half century before being caught behind trying to lift the run rate. Australia declared setting India a target of 333 to win. Some commentators, such as Tony Greig, believed that Ponting had declared too late in the innings. The situation of the game meant that India needed a run rate of well over 4, highly unlikely on the fifth-day SCG pitch. Australia needed 10 wickets to win in a minimum of 72 overs.\n\nBefore lunch Jaffer fell in the first over to Lee yet again (just as in all of his innings so far on the tour). The innings resumed after lunch but India were unable to stabilise the innings, with Tendulkar and Laxman both falling cheaply, leaving Dravid and Ganguly at the crease. A crucial moment came when Dravid and Ganguly were both batting and Dravid padded up to a ball from Symonds. It was caught by Gilchrist and Dravid was given out caught behind although replays showed the ball only hitting his pad with his bat hidden behind. In the same over, the nervous Yuvraj was out for a duck, putting India five wickets down with more than a session remaining. Ganguly was the stand-out batsman scoring 51 until being adjudged caught at slips, however the replay showed that the catch was not clean.\n\nFor a period thereafter, Dhoni and Kumble began to steady India. After surviving a few appeals and inside edges that narrowly evaded the close-in fielders at the start of their innings, they began to deal with the bowling more solidly. Dhoni adopted a strategy of padding up to as many balls from the Australian spinners as possible outside off stump, but eventually, the umpire ruled against him with less than 40 minutes remaining. However, Harbhajan came in to join his captain and appeared comfortable.\n\nWith either two or three overs remaining on day five (depending on how fast the overs were bowled) the game looked certain for a draw (as India still had three wickets in hand and were 122 runs behind). But Clarke, in just his second over, took two wickets in consecutive balls to be on a hat-trick. The first ball of his second over reared after drawing a puff of dust, caught the shoulder of Harbhajan's bat and flew to Hussey at slip, and R. P. Singh padded up to his first ball and was adjudged lbw. There was an extensive delay as the last batsman Sharma took to the field with two right-handed gloves and had to wait for the correct glove to be brought out to him. This led to suspicion that the Sharma's actions were not accidental but a time-wasting ploy. Clarke took the final wicket, Sharma, in the same over, giving Australia victory. Kumble finished the day unbeaten on 45.\n\nAfter the match ended the stadium erupted in cheering as the Indians walked off the field, and the Australians celebrated their record-equalling win, praising Michael Clarke. In an ABC radio interview on the ground, Ricky Ponting interrupted himself to tell Clarke to tell commentator Tony Greig that the declaration was timed exactly right. Gilchrist was also audibly heard shouting, \"How about that declaration, Tony Greig\". Though the teams later shook hands before heading into the dressing rooms, Kumble showed his displeasure by not shaking hands with the umpires.\n\nIndia expressed their resentment by boycotting the post-match presentation ceremony. In an on-ground interview immediately after the match had finished, Anil Kumble summed up his view of the game by stating, \"Only one team is playing in the spirit of the game\" – a statement that alluded to Australian captain Bill Woodfull's leaked private admonishment of English manager Sir Pelham Warner during the 1932–33 Bodyline series. Chetan Chauhan, India's team manager said his players were \"agitated and upset by ... the incompetent umpires here ... [and hoped] that they will not officiate again in the series\".\n\nPonting was questioned over the umpiring decisions, the racism row, and the wicket of Ganguly, when he held his finger up to indicate to Benson that Ganguly has been caught. When interviewed later by Indian journalists, Ponting was upset, admonishing them for \"questioning my [Ponting's] integrity\".\n\nThe Indian media was skeptical of Ponting's comments about Clarke's disputed catch as well as another that he claimed to have caught but was rejected by the third umpire. Some media outlets questioned Ponting's integrity, with some Indian journalists calling for Ponting to be banned for appealing for what Sunil Gavaskar claimed was a grassed catch off Dhoni and claiming Clarke's grassed catch of Ganguly.\n\nThe Australian players faced much questioning as a result of the fallout of the incident. They maintained that they played hard but fair. Lee outlined the competitive spirit in the team while Ponting insisted that the only player to have been outside the spirit of the game was on the Indian side.\n\nGilchrist commenting on the match and responding to Kumble said:\nIn regards to the racism issue, Ponting denied he had done anything wrong by singularly reporting Harbhajan. Ponting stated that he was obliged to refer any incidents of racism to officials, as it was widely agreed among the cricket community that racism is unacceptable.\n\nHussey defended his team and said:\nAfter widespread criticism of the Australian team across various media continued, a shocked Ponting promised to ensure that his team's conduct is not seen to be arrogant in future matches. He also said:\n\nFollowing a team meeting about the spirit of cricket and how to approach a game in which there is increased pressure, Ponting admitted the team needed to \"tighten up how we [the Australians] play\" although he also said \"there were no glaring issues\" that needed to be fixed up:\n\nThe Indian players released few statements about the issue. Kumble wrote in his column in the \"Hindustan Times\" that Ponting was not willing to listen to his pleas that the issue should remain on the field. Kumble claimed that he knew through experience that such an allegation would have major ramifications both on and off the field. Tendulkar reportedly sent a text message to the BCCI saying \"Harbhajan is innocent and I can assure you on this ... In this hour of crisis, the board should stand by him\". Tendulkar has reportedly denied sending an SMS to Sharad Pawar. Both teams have expressed hope that this issue would not overshadow the cricket.\n\nWhile the match was set for an intriguing contest, a number of dubious umpiring decisions were made, altering the course of the game.\n\nMuch of the criticism was attached to Bucknor; \"Bucknor had one of his worst matches as an umpire and, at 61, may be nearing the end of his career. [He made] ... several errors.\" He had earlier also been the subject of a complaint by India for dubious decisions and inappropriate gestures.\n\nBenson \"who had a good match in Melbourne, [the previous Test] did not endear himself for rejecting what looked a plumb leg-before appeal against Mike Hussey ... On 20 at the time, Hussey went on to make an unbeaten 145.\"\n\nBucknor, from Jamaica and aged 61 at the time of the Test, was the most experienced umpire in international cricket history, having stood in a record 120 Tests, and is the only umpire to have officiated in over 100 Tests. He had also stood in 167 One Day Internationals including five Cricket World Cup finals up until the Sydney Test. Benson is from England and aged 49, is a former international and first-class player and had stood in 21 Tests and 61 ODIs up to that point. Both umpires were part of the ten-member Elite Panel of ICC Umpires.\n\nAccording to Cricinfo, published reports stated that as many as 8 out of 11 controversial umpiring decisions went against the Indians. The major umpiring controversies were identified by Cricinfo, the \"Hindustan Times\" and Star Cricket who were referring to live footage of the match:\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\nDuring Australia's previous tour of India for seven ODIs in October 2007, Symonds, the only non-white Australian player, was subjected to monkey chants from some members of the Indian crowd at the fifth ODI in Vadodara.\n\nBefore the start of the tour, Symonds had expressed his displeasure over the celebrations in India over the Twenty20 World Cup win preceding the series. The tournament was won by India after defeating Australia in the semi finals and Pakistan in the final, and they were given a ticker-tape parade in Mumbai upon their return home.\n\nIn an interview after second ODI at Kochi, Harbhajan criticized the Australian team as bad losers after their defeat to India in the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup, and referred to words that he had exchanged with them in the Kochi match.\n\nDuring the Kochi match, the Indian paceman Sreesanth had several heated exchanges with Symonds when Australia were batting, and had to be pulled away from Symonds by teammates after dismissing him. However, Symonds's innings had already laid the platform for an eventual Australian victory.\n\nThe issue regarding Symonds became controversial and came to a climax during the final ODI at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, where four men were arrested for taunting Symonds with monkey gestures and a large proportion of the crowd booed Symonds when he came out to bat. Symonds fell for a golden duck.\n\nIt was reported in the media that Harbhajan had called Symonds a \"monkey\" in India, but that no further action was taken after the matter was resolved privately with a promise that it would not be repeated.\n\nPrior to this series, the two teams made a deal with the match referees to ensure good conduct. The nature of the deal has been contested by the two sides. The Australians insist that the deal stated that there would be no racism, including calling others monkeys, and Harbhajan was accused of breaking his promise to Symonds. The Indian officials believed that the deal also obligated the pair to additionally avoid exchanging words. According to Justice John Hansen who carried out the appeal for Harbhajan, the pact was broken by Symonds who swore at Harbhajan at the end of the 116th over.\n\nDuring the third day, the controversy restarted. At the end of the 116th over of India's first innings, Harbhajan was batting with Tendulkar in a vital partnership for India, who had just lost a series of quick wickets. Lee was the bowler in that over and Harbhajan had just edged him over the slips for four. Harbhajan then tapped Lee on the backside with his bat, apparently saying \"hard luck\", to which Lee did not react. Symonds says he needed to stand up for Lee so in his own words, he \"had a bit of a crack at Harbhajan, telling him exactly what I thought of his antics\". Symonds went on to claim that Harbhajan then \"shot back\" by calling him a monkey. Symonds stated in the appeal hearing that he believed that Test cricket was no place to be friendly to opposition players, so he spoke to Harbhajan. Under questioning he admitted that he had provoked the incident and used the word \"fuck\" among other language against Harbhajan, who stated that he then became \"very angry\" because of the use of this word.\n\nSachin Tendulkar, who was batting at the other end offered his inputs to the umpires, and in the ensuing hearing, and also writes in his autobiography, that he heard Symonds going after Harbhajan repeatedly in an aggressive verbal assault, even before the Brett Lee over, and after this particular incident. He said he heard Harbhajan use the north Indian swear phrase, \"Teri ma ki\", which translates to \"your mother\" in a very derogative meaning.\n\nNeither umpire heard the comment.\n\nFollowing the alleged exchange, commensurate with ICC protocol Ponting reported the incident to Benson and Bucknor, who later reported Harbhajan to the match referee Mike Procter on the charge of \"Using language or gestures that offends, insults, humiliates, intimidates, threatens, disparages or vilifies another person on the basis of that person's race, religion, gender, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.\" Kumble called Ponting at the end of the third day and asked him to not press charges against Harbhajan, wanting the issue not to leave the field. Kumble claimed \"Having played cricket for this long, [I knew] such an allegation would definitely spiral into what it has now. I anticipated that\".\n\nKumble said that he asked Harbhajan why he did it and received the reply \"he hadn't, Symonds did and goaded\", and insisted he made no racist comment. Kumble asked Ponting whether an apology from himself for the on-field altercation, as captain, would suffice (as Harbhajan was not willing to apologise) but, according to Kumble, Ponting was \"not willing to listen\". Kumble believed that the offer of an apology was interpreted by Ponting as an admission of guilt, although he explained to the Australian captain that no racist remarks were made.\n\nThe Australians have had a turbulent relationship with Harbhajan. In 1998, Harbhajan taunted Ponting when he dismissed him, resulting in the pair exchanging words directly in another's face, with both of them docked their match fees. In the historic 2000–01 tour of India, Harbhajan became the first Indian bowler to achieve a hat trick against Australia and also take two ten-wicket hauls against the Australians. Ponting made only 17 runs at 3.40 during the series, and was dismissed by Harbhajan on each of his five innings. During the 2007–08 particular tour, Harbhajan had claimed that he had the measure of Ponting, pointing to the fact that he has dismissed him six times in the last seven Tests. He claimed Ponting three times in the first four innings of the Australian tour.\n\nThe hearing for the incident was initially scheduled to be at the end of the fourth day's play, but it was postponed until after the match for fear that it would aggravate or distract the players. Mike Procter, who would be hearing the case, indicated that the umpires had not heard anything in relation to the allegations. On the evening after the end of day five, Procter, after listening to the testimony of Hayden, Symonds, Ponting and Gilchrist as well as that of Tendulkar and Harbhajan, declared that Harbhajan would be banned for three Test matches. Included in his final report were the words that \"I believe one group is telling the truth\", implying that Tendulkar and Harbhajan were lying in their testimonies, and that the Australian contingent were telling the truth \n\nAustralian spinner Brad Hogg was later charged with the same offense as Harbhajan for calling Indian captain Anil Kumble and vice-captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni \"bastards\", a highly offensive term in India, after the BCCI lodged a complaint. The term was not on a blacklist submitted by the Indians to match officials before the series, in line with ICC protocol. Hogg claimed that he did not mean to insult the Indians with the term. The term \"bastard\" in India is taken literally as someone born out of wedlock; such people often become outcastes and are frowned upon.\n\nThe hearing for Hogg's case was to be held before Procter, and the preliminary date was set for 14 January. The charges were dropped after the two captains met for peace talks along with ICC match referee Ranjan Madugalle.\n\nAfter two test losses, the Indian team announced on 7 January 2008 that they were discontinuing the tour pending the outcome of the appeal against Harbhajan's three match ban. Rather than travelling on to Canberra, after spending several hours waiting on their tour bus, the Indian team disembarked and remained in Sydney. The Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a statement in which they \"decided to challenge the unfair decision to suspend Harbhajan Singh\", stating that the ban was \"patently unfair\". Tendulkar was reported to have messaged Pawar, saying \"I suggest we should play in Perth only if the ban is lifted\". Tendulkar denied advocating a boycott. However, they went back on the suspension and proceeded to Canberra for their next outing.\n\nThe racism allegation caused considerable backlash from within India. Many, including BCCI chairman Sharad Pawar have equated it to an attack on the country's people itself, based on the apparent misunderstanding that lead to such an escalation. Pawar told Cricinfo \"allegations of racism against a member of our cricket team is not acceptable ... We fight against racism. Our country supported anti-racism movements in South Africa.\" Kumble considered the allegation one that should not have been made lightly as the team is meant to be an ambassador for the country and an allegation of racism becomes an issue of honour.\n\nICC chief executive Malcolm Speed announced that \"a commissioner will be appointed by Wednesday to hear the appeal, which could take place before the third Test starts in Perth on 16 January.\" The ICC also announced that chief referee Ranjan Madugalle has been appointed to mediate between Ponting and Kumble to reduce tensions between the two teams. One result of these talks was the dropping of the charges against Hogg. Speed also asked Cricket Australia to talk to Ponting and other players. Speed was quoted as saying that:\n\nAfterwards it was announced by the ICC that an appeal could not be heard before the Third Test, so Harbhajan was free to play until then, regardless of the appeal's result. The ICC also confirmed the New Zealand High Court judge John Hansen's appointment to oversee the appeal.\n\nOn 11 January, the BCCI president Sharad Pawar, clarified that the tour would not be canceled even if Harbhajan's appeal failed. On 14 January, the ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed announced that, the appeal would be heard on 29 and 30 January, after the fourth Test in Adelaide. He was quoted as saying that:\n\nHarbhajan did not play in the third Test in Perth as India opted to field only one spinner, Kumble, on what was expected to be a pace-friendly surface, but India opted to recall him for the fourth Test in Adelaide while his appeal was still pending.\n\nThe BCCI called for the removal of Bucknor for the third Test in Perth, although they previously agreed not to interfere with the choice of umpire for any of the matches. On 8 January the ICC confirmed Bucknor would be dropped and replaced by New Zealand umpire Billy Bowden, despite previously stating there were no plans to stand him down.\n\nOn 28 January, after the appeal hearing at Adelaide by ICC appeals commissioner Judge John Hansen, the racism charge on Harbhajan Singh was found to be \"not proved\". Harbhajan's three-Test ban was therefore lifted. However, the lesser charge (Level 2.8 offense) of using abusive language was applied and Harbhajan was fined 50% of his match fee.\n\nHansen ruled a lack of sufficient evidence. He was particularly perturbed by the fact the altercation stemmed from Symonds reacting angrily to Harbhajan patting Lee on the backside in recognition of a good delivery. Symonds' inability to conclusively say whether Harbhajan Singh had used the word monkey or a Hindi abuse, and his admission that the language did not fall under the requirements of a level 3.3 offence played a crucial part. Symonds was unable to state if he had heard Harbhajan use a term in his native tongue \"teri maa ki\" (an offensive Hindi term) which appears to be pronounced with an \"n\" and accepted that it was a possibility.\n\nMichael Clarke's account was critical, considering that it did not coincide favourably with the rest of the Australians.\n\nOf Symonds' provocation of Harbhajan, Hansen said\n\nUnlike Mike Procter, who thought Tendulkar was not in a position to hear what was uttered, Hansen said \"extensive video footage\" establishes that Tendulkar \"was within earshot and could have heard the words\". According to Hansen, video replays from various camera angles showed that Tendulkar was the closest player to the conversation and was likely to have heard it. Tendulkar admitted words were spoken in both English and Hindi. Hansen also rejected the suggestion that the BCCI and Cricket Australia reached an agreement which he simply rubber-stamped.\n\nHe was also critical of all parties involved in the confrontation in Sydney, saying \"their actions do not reflect well on them or the game\".\n\nFormer Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram lashed out against the \"hypocritical\" Australians for reporting Harbhajan, despite being known for their sledging and despite a rumoured pre-series agreement not to refer to Symonds, Australia's only dark skinned player, using the word \"monkey\" as Indian cricket fans had done in their recent home series. Akram further attacked them by calling them the \"worst sledgers\" in the world and labeling them as \"cry babies\":\n\nIndian officials further went on to claim that because \"monkey\" was not a derogatory word in India it was acceptable.\n\nHowever, Rashid Latif, a former Pakistani cricketer who was accused of being a racist to Adam Gilchrist during the 2003 Cricket World Cup, noted that Harbhajan was renowned for having temper problems :\n\nJohn Morrison, former New Zealand spin-bowler accused Australians of \"running off to the teacher\", while his former teammate Dipak Patel, of Indian descent, said that he had been called \"a lot worse than a monkey\".\n\nHarsha Bhogle, an Indian commentator of the channel Star Cricket said during the commentary when the game ended:\n\nDuring the Clarke's claimed catch and when Ponting held up his finger, the former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar commented on air:\n\nGavaskar strongly condemned Procter, accusing him of blatant racism for \"taking the 'white man's' word against that of the 'brown man' \" in handling the racism allegations and imposing the ban of three Tests on Harbhajan Singh. Gavaskar was also skeptical regarding the motivation of Australian team in reporting Harbhajan Singh, because he has dismissed Australian captain Ricky Ponting in three times in the current series. In his newspaper column to \"Hindustan Times\", Gavaskar wrote:\n\nChristopher Martin-Jenkins, chief cricket correspondent for \"The Times\" in the United Kingdom defended the \"righteous indignation of India's players\" and suggested that the BCCI's adamance to give the issue the necessary publicity has been better for the game. Martin-Jenkins also described Australia as the \"nonpareils of world sledging\" and expressed the view that Michael Clarke would be less appropriate as a future captain than Mike Hussey based on Clarke's decision to stand his ground after being caught at first slip.\n\nFormer player and match referee Clive Lloyd commenting on Steve Bucknor being stood down for the next test match in a BBC Radio 5 Live interview said:\nFormer England cricketer and current Channel Nine commentator Tony Greig, whose comments on air were criticised by Ricky Ponting stood by his observations saying:\n\nGoing on to comment on other issues of the game including umpiring and the ethics of walking, he said:\nEnglish journalist Simon Barnes writing for \"The Australian\" believed it was too late to draw a racism line in the sand. Barnes alleged that sledging is as much part of cricket as kicking in the shins is as part of rugby. According to Barnes \"Australia has long promoted mental disintegration; as a result, we are facing the disintegration of the game of cricket.\"\n\nOliver Brett of BBC Sport was sympathetic towards the Indians. Brett claimed that Ponting's word should not have been taken as fact by Procter as Ponting had claimed a catch that was \"obviously grassed\" and had raised his finger to Benson to indicate certainty that a dubious catch had been taken.\n\nCricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland defended the Australian players' behaviour, claiming that there had been a \"marked improvement\" in their on-field attitude and behaviour in recent years. Paul Marsh, the chief of the Australian Cricketers Association, which represents the country's first-class cricketers, believed the issues to be an instance of \"tall poppy syndrome\", claiming that the only reason Australia was being targeted by the media and opposition teams was that they had been dominating world cricket for too long. Later, in a \"Sydney Morning Herald\" article, Marsh pointed out that Australia was one of the four nominees to the ICC Spirit of Cricket awards, which occurred in September 2007. Marsh also pointed out that the Hogg incident was the first ICC Code of Conduct violation by the Australian team in 13 months. None of these comments, however approach directly the subject of Aussie sledging.\n\nSteve Waugh writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\" in his article titled \"Epic encounter's sour aftertaste\" said:\nHe further said that the affair \"now has the potential to affect relations between the countries\". Waugh further offered to act as a mediator between the two sides.\n\nThe English journalist and former captain of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck, a columnist for \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" and \"The Age\", branded Ponting as \"arrogant\" and insisted that he be stripped of the captaincy.\n\nThere was support for Ponting among some quarters of the media with \"The Australian\"'s Malcolm Conn suggesting that he was being unfairly targeted.\n\nFormer player and now coach and commentator Geoff Lawson was scathing in his description of the team. Speaking to the \"Herald Sun\", he said:\n\nAmerica's Cup-winning yachtsman John Bertrand, Olympic 1500 m gold medal-winning runner Herb Elliott and world champion marathon runner Robert de Castella, all members of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, accused the Australian cricket team of turning sport into war and thereby damaging international relations and placing the country in a negative light. John Bertrand, the Hall of Fame chairman, went on to say that:\n\nKevin Bartlett, former Australian rules football player, accused the Australian cricket team of bad sportsmanship towards its opponents by saying that:\n\nGlenn McGrath, a recently retired Australian cricketer who played alongside most of Ponting's men, commented upon the decision to stand down Steve Bucknor by saying:\nThe federal opposition leader in Australia Brendan Nelson defended Ponting and said:\nNeil Harvey, member of Don Bradman's \"Invincibles\" as well as the Australian Cricket Board Team of the Century and Australian Cricket Hall of Fame inductee, blamed Ponting, saying that:\n\nJeff Thomson, the former Australian fast bowler, harshly criticised the Australians by saying that:\n\nOn 10 January, following repetitive criticism of the Australian team, \"The Australian\" posted on their websites a video of the , in which Harbhajan stands his ground after being clean bowled by Kevin Pietersen, having an exchange with the bowler including swearing to him, before leaving. On the same day, Channel Nine posted videos of the Harbhajan incident as well as an instance in which Dhoni dived to his right and claimed a catch which had bounced at the base of his glove. Channel Nine claimed there was \"hypocrisy afoot\" under a headline of \"Holier-than-thou Indians are sinners too\". In the same article it posted a 1981 video of Gavaskar ordering his partner Chetan Chauhan to leave the playing arena and stop the Test match after incorrectly being given out, in a bid to back up its argument.\n\nThe issue was a highly volatile subject in media in both Australia and India. After the meeting of the captains prior to the third Test the teams appeared to be in better spirits, although some media outlets suggested the Australians had been trying to alter the way they play in response to the criticism and to fit in with the vague definition of the 'spirit of the game'. India won the next Test in Perth by a fair margin and drew the fourth match in Adelaide, giving Australia a 2–1 victory in the series. In the context of the series result the Sydney Test ended up being pivotal.\n\n"}

Children have always had small imitations of things from the adult world and toy guns are no exception. From a hand-carved wooden replicas to factory-produced pop guns and cap guns, toy guns come in all sizes, prices and materials such as wood, metal, plastic or any combination thereof. Many newer toy guns are brightly colored and oddly shaped to prevent them from being mistaken for real firearms.\n\nWooden guns are made to resemble real guns, often handmade these toys may or may not have metal parts and are made with various levels of detail.\n\nRubber band guns, are toy gun used to fire one or more rubber bands (or \"elastic bands\"). Rubber band guns are often used in live-action games such as Assassins, in which they are common and popular toy weapons. They are also common in offices and classrooms. Rubber band guns have been popular toys that date back to the invention of rubber bands, which were patented in England on March 17, 1845 by Stephen Perry.\nCap guns, cap pistol, or cap rifle are toy guns that creates a loud sound simulating a gunshot and a puff of smoke when a small percussion cap is exploded. Cap guns were originally made of cast iron, but after World War II were made of zinc alloy, and most newer models are made of plastic.\n\nModel guns are Japanese full-size toy guns that highly replicate the appearance, design and operation of the real ones but cannot shoot any projectile. It comes as either ignition models (very sophisticated type of cap guns) or non-ignition dummy models. Both are subject to the strict Japanese Gun Control Law for identification and to prevent possible modification.\n\nProp guns are toy guns that have to look real guns. They are commonly used in movies, TV show and other theatrical performances.\nPop guns (also written as popgun or pop-gun) is a toy gun that was made by American inventor Edward Lewis and uses air pressure to fire a small tethered or untethered projectile (such as cork or foam) out of a barrel, most often via piston action though sometimes via spring pressure. Other variants do not launch the obstruction, but simply create a loud noise. This mechanism consists of a hollow cylindrical barrel which is sealed at one end with the projectile and at the other with a long-handled plunger. In this type, the plunger is rapidly forced down the barrel, building up internal air pressure until the projectile is forced out with the \"pop\" sound that lends the toy its name.\nRay guns are a science fiction particle-beam weapon that fires what is usually destructive energy. They have various alternate names: ray gun, death ray, beam gun, blaster, laser gun, laser pistol, phaser, zap gun, etc. In most stories, when activated, a raygun emits a ray, typically visible, usually lethal if it hits a human target, often destructive if it hits mechanical objects, with properties and other effects unspecified or varying. Toy ray guns often have mechanical component that spark, light-up and make a sound effect.\nWater guns are a type of toy gun that uses a verity of methods to shoot water. Many early small water guns used the same trigger based pumping mechanism used for spray bottles. In this type of device, the trigger actuates a positive displacement pump shaft. With the aid of two check valves, often using small balls, fluid is drawn into the pump from a reservoir, then forced out the nozzle upon squeezing the trigger. The simplicity of the spraying mechanism allowed these toys to be manufactured cheaply, and allowed the majority of the body to be used as the reservoir. The primary limitation with this design is the volume of water that can be effectively moved per pump. Increasing pump volume would require more user effort to push the fluid out, making larger designs impractical. However, this technology remains widely used today both in spray bottles as well as small water guns that can be found in a wide variety of shapes and colors.\n\nTracer guns, sometimes known as a disc gun, is a kind of toy gun made of durable plastic. The toy shoots lightweight plastic discs roughly the size of a penny. The discs used as ammunition for these guns are often sold with the label \"Jet Discs.\" The firing mechanism is a spring, The magazine holds 20 \"discs.\" Range is about 10 feet, and even then, accuracy is far from dependable. The trigger requires some force. The firing sound is loud, low, and distinctive. Oftentimes the trigger will become loose and will take multiple attempts to shoot.\nNerf guns are toy guns made by Hasbro that fires foam darts, discs, or foam balls. The term \"Nerf gun\" is often used to describe the toy; however, it is often used as a blanket term for any foam dart blaster, regardless of whether or not it has the Nerf brand name. Nerf blasters are manufactured in multiple forms, including pistols, rifles, and light machine guns. The first Nerf blasters emerged in the late 1980s with the release of the Nerf Blast-a-Ball and the Arrowstorm.\nAirsoft guns are replica weapons used in airsoft sports. They are essentially a special type of very low-power smoothbore air guns designed to shoot non-metallic spherical projectiles often colloquially (and incorrectly) referred to as \"BBs\", which are typically made of (but not limited to) plastic or biodegradable resin materials. Airsoft gun powerplants are designed to have low muzzle energy ratings (generally less than 1.5 J, or 1.1 ft⋅lb) and the pellets have significantly less penetrative and stopping powers than conventional air guns, and are generally safe for competitive sporting and recreational purposes if proper protective gear is worn.\nLight guns are pointing devices for computers and a control device for arcade and video games, typically shaped to resemble a pistol. Modern screen-based light guns work by building an optical sensor into the gun, which receives its input from the light emitted by on-screen target(s). The first device of this type, the light pen, was used on the MIT Whirlwind computer.\nPaintball guns , paint gun, or marker gun, is the main piece of paintball equipment in the sport of paintball. Markers use an expanding gas, such as carbon dioxide (CO) or compressed air, to propel paintballs through the barrel and quickly strike a target. The term \"marker\" is derived from its original use as a means for forestry personnel to mark trees and ranchers to mark wandering cattle.\nLaser tag gun is a tag game played with toy guns which fire infrared beams. Infrared-sensitive targets are commonly worn by each player and are sometimes integrated within the arena in which the game is played. Since its birth in 1979, with the release of the Star Trek Electronic Phasers toy manufactured by the South Bend Electronics brand of Milton Bradley, laser tag has evolved into both indoor and outdoor styles of play, and may include simulations of combat, role play-style games, or competitive sporting events including tactical configurations and precise game goals. Laser tag is popular with a wide range of ages. When compared to paintball, laser tag is painless because it uses no physical projectiles, and indoor versions may be considered less physically demanding because most indoor venues prohibit running or roughhousing.\nDummy guns have been historically used by police and military organizations for training purposes. During World War II, Parris Manufacturing Company provided over 2 million accurate copies of the M1903 Springfield rifles, the MK 1 USN Dummy Training Rifle to the U.S. armed forces. After the war they continued manufacture and sell their replicas as toy guns. As well as smaller sized models for children that featured a working bolt with a dummy bullet, leather sling, the clicker action, and a smaller rubber bayonet similar to the M1 bayonet.\nToday, the United States military, calls these dummy training guns \"rubber ducks\" or \"blue guns\", usually resembling an M16 type rifle. Trainees are issued rubber ducks before they have been properly trained to use actual rifles, in order to become familiar with the care, responsible handling, and added weight of an M16 during various activities, such as bayonet drills, water survival and marches. They are also used to train soldiers in various ceremonial practices that differ when soldiers are armed. For example, standing at attention requires a different stance and set of movements when the soldier has a rifle in-hand.\n\nChildren have always had small imitations of things from the adult world and toy guns are no exception. From a hand-carved wooden replica to factory-produced pop guns and cap guns, toy guns came in all sizes, prices and materials from wood, to metal, to plastic or any combination thereof.\n\nWith the influence of Hollywood and comic strips, tie-ins could make an ordinary toy gun a major bestseller. In the 1930s Daisy Outdoor Products came out with a Buck Rogers Rocket Pistol (1933), Disintegrator Pistol (1934), and Liquid Helium Pistol (1935) that sold in record numbers.\nMattel had used television advertising to sell their \"burp gun\" on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" in the mid-1950s to great effect. In 1959 Mattel sponsored their own television show Matty's Funday Funnies with their trademark little boy \"Matty\" showing cartoons and advertising their products. Mattel toys came out with Dick Tracy weapons in 1960 that were state of the art. Not only could the \"Dick Tracy Crimestoppers\" have a realistic snubnosed revolver in a shoulder holster, but Mattel also boosted junior law enforcement firepower with a Dick Tracy cap firing tommy gun that fired a burst of 6 caps \"automatically\" when the M-1 Thompson-style bolt was pulled back. One commercial featured Billy Mumy demonstrating the weapons to his father prior to watching \"Dick Tracy\" on TV. Mattel also came up with a \"Dick Tracy Water Jet Gun\" that was a miniature replica of a police pump action shotgun that fired caps when you pulled the trigger \"and\" squirted water when you pumped the slide. When the Dick Tracy craze faded the same two weapons were reissued in military camouflage as Green Beret \"Guerrilla Fighter\" weapons. (see United States Army Special Forces in popular culture). Mattel later issued the same tommy gun in its original colours as a \"Planet of the Apes\" tie-in complete with ape mask.\nIn the mid-1960s, Multiple Toymakers/Multiple Plastics Corporation (MPC) came out with James Bond's attaché case from \"From Russia with Love\". Topper Toys replied with a copy called \"Secret Sam\" that featured a toy gun that fired plastic bullets \"through\" the attaché case and had a working camera that outsold 007's kit. MPC toys replied with a \"B.A.R.K\" - \"Bond Assault and Raider Kit\" an attaché case that opened up to display a firing mortar and a rocket shooting pistol. MPC also provided a \"Bond-O-Matic\" water pistol. Bond's television competition The Man From U.N.C.L.E. had their pistol with attachments that turned it into a rifle made by both the Ideal Toy Company in the US and the Lone Star Toys company in the United Kingdom. Mattel came out with a series of \"Zero-M\" secret-agent weapons such as a camera turning into a pistol and a radio turning into a rifle demonstrated by a juvenile Agent Zero M played by Kurt Russell.\n\nPerhaps the ultimate toy weapon was the 1964 Topper Toys Johnny Seven OMA (One Man Army) where an exciting television commercial showed one little boy using each of the seven weapons of the gun to wipe out a neighborhood full of children armed only with \"ordinary\" toy guns. Though an amazing seller, the \"Captain Kangaroo\" television program refused to air the advertisement. The proliferation of toy weapons was satirized in the \"Our Man in Toyland\" episode of \"Get Smart\".\n\nIn the 1970s, the \"Star Wars\" media franchise provided new laser blaster and lightsabers produced by Kenner Toys.\n\nToy guns can cause harm like many objects not under proper supervision. Unlike most other toys though, much of the danger of these toys is related to mistaking a toy gun for a real gun or vice versa. For example:\n\n\nToy guns were temporary removed from the Sears Roebuck 1968 Christmas catalog after the assassinations of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. and U.S. Senator, former United States Attorney General, and presidential candidate Robert Francis Kennedy. However, they returned to the Sears catalog the following year.\nBeginning in the 1970s, American gun control advocates called for federal government to regulate and/or ban the manufacture and sale of toy guns. These calls were countered by toy industry groups, who preferred to set their own standards. In 1973, the newly formed U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission received petitions and letters from consumers, asking the commission to institute mandatory safety standards for the design of toy weapons. These calls for action were repeated in 1975. However, the trade association representing the toy weapon manufacturers also contacted the CPSC, asking them to delay until the industry developed their own set of voluntary standards. The voluntary guidelines that were published over the next few years emphasized the use of warning labels on packaging and instructions, rather than mandating safety standards for the design of projectile toys. The Consumer Product Safety Commission rejected further petitions to regulate toy weapon manufacture in 1981 and 1985. In 1992, the Department of Commerce prohibited the manufacture, sale, or shipping of toy guns unless they have an orange tip or are entirely brightly colored. The regulation does not prohibit end-users from modifying the toys.\n\nIn March 2018, Walmart (the largest single retailer in the United States) announced that they would stop selling certain types of toy guns. “We are also removing items from our website resembling assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys,” the company said in a statement.\n\nIn the United States, federal law and regulations indicate that all toy guns transported or imported into the country must have a 6mm-wide blaze orange tip or a blaze orange stripe 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) thick on both sides of the barrel. However, this is not required by federal law for airsoft and paintball. Part 272 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations on foreign commerce and trade (15 CFR 272) states that \"no person shall manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm\" without approved markings; these may include an orange tip, orange barrel plug, brightly colored (safety orange) exterior of the whole toy, or transparent construction.\n\nNew York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and parts of Michigan have completely banned airsoft guns. Chicago goes even further with their mandates. It is considered a crime to wield a look-alike or replica gun (e.g., toy gun, airsoft gun) in public. If a toy gun or replica gun is used to commit a crime in Chicago, then that person is treated as though they had actually used a real firearm.\n\nThere is a controversy as to whether or not toy guns are appropriate for children to play with. Some people believe they can encourage violence. In 2007, the British Department for Children, Schools and Families (which existed between 2007 and 2010) has advised young boys be encouraged to play with toy guns, as it will encourage them to learn and foster their development. However, the National Union of Teachers in England has criticised this advice, arguing that toy guns \"symbolise aggression\" and that encouraging boys to play with them fosters gender stereotypes.\n\nIn 2016, Shafeeq Gigyani (activist), who is a peace activist in Pakistan, started a campaign against toy guns.\n\n\n"}

The show lasted for three seasons from 1990 until 1992 for a total of 65 episodes. \"Wild & Crazy Kids\" starred three teenage co-hosts with Omar Gooding and Donnie Jeffcoat (seasons 1–3), Annette Chavez (now Annette M. Lesure) in season 1 and Jessica Gaynes in seasons 2 and 3.\n\nIn 2002, a revival was produced which lasted ten episodes and aired on Nickelodeon from July 29 to October 7, 2002. It was hosted by Mati Moralejo of Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids.\n\nEach episode consisted of three games with one host emceeing each game. The teams were identified by the color of the shirts they wore, which varied from show to show (see below). The games varied in style; many were take-offs on playground games, sports with unusual rules added, or messy games involving pies or slime (the latter was referred to as \"blap\" beginning in season three). Occasionally, the show taped special episodes at a theme park such as Raging Waters, Wild Rivers, and Six Flags Magic Mountain.\n\n\n\n\nA pilot was shot in 1989, hosted by Matt Brown (who co-hosted \"Don't Just Sit There\" on Nickelodeon), Leslie Hibbard and Cory Tyler.\n\nDuring the first and second seasons, there were occasionally adult celebrity guests, and one of Season 2's final episodes held a kids and teens celebrity slide competition game at Raging Waters in San Dimas, California to raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The entire third season in 1992 featured at least one (and sometimes more) kid celebrity guest(s) every episode. Guests were people like actor and former bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lark Voorhies from \"Saved by the Bell\", Jonathan Taylor Thomas from \"Home Improvement\", Ashley Johnson from \"Growing Pains\", and Michael Fishman from \"Roseanne\". A young Tobey Maguire appeared on the show long before he was famous, promoting the short-lived Fox sitcom \"Great Scott!\". Other appearances include:\n\nThe show was executive produced by Woody Fraser, and aired 65 episodes from July 4, 1990, to December 1, 1992.
