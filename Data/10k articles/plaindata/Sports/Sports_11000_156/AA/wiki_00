The site was previously branded as \"Baseball Primer\", and was created in 2001 by the founders of Baseball-Reference. Contributors who have gone on to work for Major League Baseball front offices include Voros McCracken, Carlos Gomez, and Tom Tango. Bill James' \"Baseball Abstract\" books published in the 1980s are widely considered to be the modern predecessor to websites using sabermetrics such as \"baseballthinkfactory\" and baseballprospectus.\n\nThe site was founded in 2001 by Jim Furtado and Sean Forman of Baseball-Reference under the name \"Baseball Primer,\" with a matching URL of (http://www.baseballprimer.com/). The site's emphasis on sabermetric baseball analysis attracted members of the rec.sport.baseball Usenet groups, and later drew readers of Rob Neyer's ESPN columns. The early site cultivated spirited discussions as a result of the Usenet veterans' familiarity with each other and the fact that registration was not required to post comments. The site also featured a number of original research articles.\n\nIn 2004, the site was re-branded as \"Baseball Think Factory\" and was re-built on a different software platform in order to support the growing user population and accommodate user registration and content management features.\n\nBTF mainly hosts baseball discussions. \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine listed the site as an \"essential baseball destination,\" characterizing it as offering \"links to significant baseball articles, accompanied by freewheeling, usually informed discussion threads.\" Michael Lewis also mentioned the site (as \"baseballprimer\") in his book Moneyball.\n\nThe site features a number of sections with content for different audiences. These include:\n\nBTF has featured numerous original research articles, primarily under the aforementioned sub-sites \"Transaction Oracle,\" \"Dialed In,\" and \"Primate Studies.\" Several analysts such as Mitchel Lichtman and Tom Tango regularly posted original research articles and participated on discussion and criticism of the work at BTF before going on to establish their own sites and to publish results in book form.\n\nGiven that statistics characterizing major league offense (batting) are fairly well established, much of the research posted on BTF spotlight defense (fielding) in the form of statistics more accurate than traditional fielding statistics. Examples include:\n\nLitchman created fielding metrics that use play-by-play records that record the location of individual batted balls. Litchman combines this play-by-play data with his linear-weights system that assigns run values to the various baseball plays and their context within the game (inning, runners on base, score, etc.) Some of his initial articles on the system were posted on BTF.\n\nLichtman's Ultimate zone ratings (UZR) statistics can now be found on the baseball website Fangraphs.\n\nSzymborski posts updates from his forecasting system known as \"ZiPS\" under his sub-site \"Transaction Oracle\". ZiPS results are also used in his articles evaluating Major League Baseball transactions. These projections can also be found on Fangraphs, updated for in-season projections.\n\nDial is a SABR member who contributes articles to BTF, many focusing on statistics measuring defense. Dial has studied STATS, Inc.'s \"zone rating\" for years and posts updated statistics based on this data and on Retrosheet data. Some of Dial's more notable articles include:\n\nGomez is a former college and professional pitcher who contributed articles featuring detailed, frame-by-frame analyses of pitcher mechanics. Prior to their publication, the average fan had little access to detailed evaluations of pitchers' mechanics and had to rely on short descriptions gleaned by beat reporters from scouting reports.

Tullio Arena) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the downtown area of Erie, Pennsylvania. It is home to the Erie Otters of the Ontario Hockey League and the Erie BayHawks of the NBA G League. It was built in 1983 as part of the Louis J. Tullio Plaza, which also includes the Warner Theatre and UPMC Park – all of which are administered by the Erie County Convention Center Authority. The arena is named for the Erie Insurance Group, which purchased the naming rights in May 2012.\n\nErie Insurance Arena was built for $9.3 million in 1983. It opened in June 1983 with a Beach Boys concert. Since then, it has hosted entertainers including Elton John, Rod Stewart, Cher, KISS, Barry Manilow, Alan Jackson, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and Alice Cooper. Erie Insurance Arena has also featured Disney on Ice, World Wrestling Entertainment, Impact Wrestling, the Harlem Globetrotters, and Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\n\nIn May 2012, the Erie County Convention Center Authority and the Erie Insurance Group announced a 10-year, $3 million naming agreement that would rename the former Louis J. Tullio Arena, \"Erie Insurance Arena.\" This renaming coincided with the completion of the current $42 million renovation project that was completed in September 2013. The renovation, designed by Friday/Sink Combs Dethlefs Joint Venture Architects, modernized the arena and added some new sections and a landscaped park entrance. Construction on the project was carried out by the Pittsburgh-based Turner Construction Company. Improvements included additional seating and concourses. To accommodate this, its footprint expanded from the original to . This increased the venue's capacity to 6,833 for hockey, 6,754 for basketball and about 9,000 for concerts. Erie Insurance Arena now has enlarged lobbies, more box office windows, luxury suites, administrative offices, mechanical rooms, training areas, new locker rooms, and a club level sponsored by the \"Erie Times-News\". Funding for the renovations derived from $32 million pledged by former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, combined with $10 million paid by Erie County. The arena has hosted numerous high school and college basketball games. Two of the most notable basketball games were between Cathedral Preparatory School and McDowell and local colleges, Gannon University and Mercyhurst University. Both games featured rival schools. Both games generated the most attended high school and college basketball games in city history, both selling out at 5,500.\n\nIn September 2014, the Erie County Convention Center Authority completed a $1.4 million upgrade to the arena which had been dropped from the previous renovation due to a tightened budget. This upgrade included a closed-circuit video system, high-definition video panels on the east and west ends of the arena, and a high-definition \"center ice\" video scoreboard. The new scoreboard replaced the scoreboard added in 2006. The video boards replaced scoreboards from the original construction of the arena in 1983. The new scoreboard and video boards were manufactured by Daktronics.\n\nLouis J. Tullio Arena, in conjunction with Mercyhurst College, hosted the 2011 NCAA National Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Tournament, in which the Wisconsin Badgers defeated the Boston University Terriers in the championship final by a score of 4-1.\n\nErie Insurance Arena, in conjunction with Gannon University, hosted the NCAA Division II Women's Basketball Tournament, in which the Bentley Falcons defeated the West Texas A&M Buffaloes 73–65.\n\nErie Insurance Arena offers conventional food and beverage offerings such as pizza and corn dogs, as well as some more local items such as Greek hot dogs, Greek nachos, and pepperoni balls. The venue offers a separate menu for the floor seats, which includes the shrimp cocktail, spinach artichoke dip, steak burger on a pretzel bun, chicken bacon sandwich, cheesesteak, and a vegetable platter.

It can be dedicated to wholesale trade between fishermen and fish merchants, or to the sale of seafood to individual consumers, or to both. Retail fish markets, a type of wet market, often sell street food as well.\n\nFish markets range in size from small fish stalls, such as the one in the photo at the right, to the great Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, turning over about 660,000 tonnes a year.\n\nThe term \"fish market\" can also refer to the process of fish marketing in general, but this article is concerned with physical marketplaces.\n\nFish markets were known in antiquity. They served as a public space where large numbers of people could gather and discuss current events and local politics.\n\nBecause seafood is quick to spoil, fish markets are historically most often found in seaside towns. Once ice or other simple cooling methods became available, some were also established in large inland cities that had good trade routes to the coast.\n\nSince refrigeration and rapid transport became available in the 19th and 20th century, fish markets can technically be established at any place. However, because modern trade logistics in general has shifted away from marketplaces and towards retail outlets, such as supermarkets, most seafood worldwide is now sold to consumers through these venues, like most other foodstuffs.\n\nConsequently, most major fish markets now mainly deal with wholesale trade, and the existing major fish retail markets continue to operate as much for traditional reasons as for commercial ones. Both types of fish markets are often tourist attractions as well.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of notable fish markets. (See also .)\n\n\n\n\n"}

The skill begins as a backward salto with the gymnast completing a 1/2 twist (180°) before regrasp on the same bar that was released. The Gienger can be done with either a piked (traditional) or stretched body form. A variation on the Gienger is the Def (COP 3.605), which is a G-rated element and is identical to the Gienger except that instead of a 1/2 twist (180°), the gymnast performs 1 1/2 twists (540°) before regrasp on the bar.\n\nGienger saltos are technically similar to Deltchev saltos, with the latter initiating the 1/2 twist before initiating the Arabian (which is also usually straddled rather than piked or stretched).\n\nSome of the female gymnasts that perform the Gienger are Nastia Liukin, Eugenia Popa, and Shawn Johnson.\n"}

{"id": "31022329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31022329", "title": "Motordrome (Melbourne)", "text": "Motordrome (Melbourne)\n\nThe Motordrome, also known as the Olympic Park Speedway, the Melbourne Speedway or the Victorian Speedway, was a former speedway and Australian rules football ground located on the site of Olympic Park in Melbourne, Victoria. The ground was primarily a speedway track, but also hosted football matches.\n\nMelbourne Carnivals Pty. Ltd, a company established in 1923 by Jack Campbell and Jim DuFrocq, developed and leased a large site known as the Amateur Sports Ground from the Crown with the help of local entrepreneur John Wren. On the site, the Motordrome was constructed. The stadium contained a grassed oval suitable for football, set inside a saucer-shaped concrete oval track suitable for motor racing; the track was a third of a mile long and banked at a 46° angle. Although Melbourne Carnivals originally had visions for the stadium to accommodate 100,000 spectators, it was ultimately built to accommodate around 32,000. The Motordrome was opened on 29 November 1924, and 32,000 spectators attended the inaugural race meeting.\n\nIn 1933, the ageing concrete surface of the motor racing track was no longer suitable for the higher powered vehicles which used it, so it was demolished and replaced with a dirt track which continued to be used for motor racing. In the same year, the Amateur Sports Ground was renamed Olympic Park, and the name was generally used for both the former Motordrome stadium, and the wider park in which it was situated. The name change had no connection to the Olympic Games – Melbourne was not selected as the host of the 1956 Summer Olympics until 1949 – and rather was chosen because the former name 'Amateur Sports Ground' no longer reflected the class and type of sport which was now played on the grounds.\n\nThe complex was sold after the Second World War and began to be converted into the Olympic Park Stadium used during the 1956 Olympics.\n\nDuring the time of the Great Depression the ground regularly drew in crowds of more than 30,000 to watch speedway, motorcycle and sidecar racing. It is generally acknowledged that the first Speedcar race in Australia took place at the speedway in 1934.\n\nIn 1936/37, the speedway also saw two Motorcycle speedway test matches between the Australians, including future (1938) Speedway World Champion Bluey Wilkinson, taking on the visiting Americans who included the 1937 World Champion Jack Milne and his younger brother Cordy, as well as Wilbur Lamoreaux who would finish second behind Milne in the 1937 World Final at the Empire Stadium in London (Cordy Milne would finish third). Australia won the first test 31-23 on 19 December 1936, and won the third test 30-24 on 23 January 1937 (the second test, won 29-24 by Australia, was held at the Sydney Showground on 28 December).\n\nAlthough not much top-level football was played on the Motordrome, its presence as a high capacity centrally-located ground had a significant off-field impact on football during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nWhen the venue was first established in 1924, the Victorian Football League was very keen for strategic reasons to control it. Melbourne Carnivals had offered to lease the ground to the new Public Service Football Club if it were admitted to the League in 1925. This offer became the trigger for off-field negotiations which ultimately saw , and admitted to the VFL, but saw the VFL fail to secure the use of the Motordrome. There had been proposals for the Richmond Football Club to move to the venue, or for it to be used as a neutral venue to which each club moved one or two of its home matches each year; however, these proposals fell through. The Victorian Football Association went on to play its finals matches at the venue in 1925, 1926 and 1927.\n\nPrior to the 1931 season, the VFL and the Grounds Management Association (which represented the operators of most of the VFL grounds) entered a dispute over the use of the grounds for football matches, covering financial arrangements and the demarcation between the football and cricket seasons. During the dispute, the VFL arranged for the Motordrome, as well as the Exhibition Oval, to host twelve games which were to be transferred away from the grounds involved in the dispute, but the dispute was ultimately resolved through arbitration in March and the games were transferred back to their original grounds.\n\nThen in 1932, the VFA signed a deal to use the Motordrome as a neutral central venue from 1933 until 1940. Under the agreement, the VFA would play one match at the ground each weekend during the season, with each club moving one or two of its home games to the ground each year, as well as playing the finals there. This caused a massive dispute with the local councils which owned the VFA's suburban grounds, and it culminated in seven of the VFA's twelve clubs being kicked out of their local grounds until the agreement was rescinded, almost ruining the 1934 VFA season and potentially forcing those clubs to disband or secede \"en masse\" from the VFA. The agreement was rescinded shortly before the season began.\n\nThe Richmond Football Club formally announced its intentions to move its home base from the Punt Road Oval to Olympic Park prior to the 1936 season, owing mostly to an ongoing dispute with the Richmond Cricket Club. Richmond's proposal to move was ultimately voted down by the VFL, but only by the casting vote of League president William McClelland.\n\nThe only VFL premiership football ever played at the venue occurred during the early part of 1932, when played three home matches there because the Melbourne Cricket Ground was being resurfaced.\n\nIn the 1935 pre-season, the venue staged a night match under electric floodlights between 1934 VFL Grand Finalists and . The players had some visibility problems, mostly with depth perception, but the match attracted 25,000 spectators. Further exhibition night matches were played at the end of 1935 between VFA Grand Finalists Yarraville and Camberwell, and at the end of 1936 between combined teams representing the VFL and VFA.\n\nSchool and junior football was regularly played on the venue.\n\nOn 11 December 1926, the venue hosted a shambolic ostrich racing event. A full program of races was scheduled, but the event was cancelled after three farcical attempts at races – in which startled ostriches ridden by inanimate jockeys ran in opposite directions, and ostriches attached to sulkies failed to break out of a walk.\n\n"}

The designers were inspired by the children's game Folter-Mau-Mau and the development of the modern computer game. \n\nA similar game concept was featured in the 1983 James Bond movie \"Never Say Never Again\".\n\nThe original concept was followed up with other stages of development which were regularly exhibited worldwide in different cultural contexts.\n\nFollowing talks with Sony, the artists described the Painstation as \"The artwork formerly known as Painstation\".\n\nWhile the underlying artistic concept remained consistent over the years, the group continues to improve on the system.\n\nThe Painstation consists of a specially made case which gives two players the opportunity of playing a specially adapted and expanded variant of the classic video game, Pong, against each other. The electronic controls are connected by digital transducers to several components providing sensory feedback to players.\n\nDuring the game, the players place their left hands on the PEU (Pain Execution Unit) which serves as a sensor and feedback instrument. Possible feedback effects are heat impulses, an electric shock and an integrated miniature wire whip. The feedback generated is dependent on the playing process and can increase in its intensity. The respective opponent can try to alter his or her playing style to purposely change the intensity of the feedback.\n\nThe following bonus items can be activated by hits in the current version of the software in 2006:\n\n\nNo matter the score, the first player to remove his or her hand from the PEU device loses the game.\n\nThe heart of the original system was the Apple Computer G3 Macintosh, as well as a specifically made control plate. The programming was done with Macromedia Director and C++.The model was developed predominately out of available junk using a tube monitor. The first five high scores were originally computer generated absurdly high as a deterrent, but one entry was actually overwritten by a player at the Games Convention in 2006. Since then, \"GOL\" is on the list in second place with 300 points.\n\nStarting in 2002, the successor of the original Painstation was developed, the Painstation 2.0.\n\nApart from adjustable pain levels, it offers several replaceable whips and an additional source of light which players can use to produce glare on their opponent's side of the screen. The program was reprogrammed under Windows and the application was implemented in C++ and OpenGL, because the hardware the previous version had been based on became obsolete. The PEUs were fabricated for the first time with lasers from stainless steel. The higher processor performance makes it possible for the system to control the speed of the whip engine and the strength of the electric current individually.\n\nThe system was also for the first time made coin-operated. It is equipped with a 15 inch LCD monitor and it was shown to the public on June 25, 2003 on the German Harald Schmidt television show.\n\nThe new case, painted in three metallic colors, consists mostly of medium density wood fiber panels and has a modular design. This makes it easier to transport the system and to exchange defective components. Besides a 15 inch color screen, there is standard PC technology inside and a special control plate. The pain levels can be changed from 50% to 150%. The player must confirm that they are willing to participate in the game by pressing a \"I agree\" button before playing. Added benefits for the players include leather padded arm rests and the new ergonomic layout of the controls. Newly added fans in the PEUs cool the system down better between games to avoid electronic problems and can serve the players if they hit the right bonus item.\n\n\nThe system has been publicly presented at the following exhibitions and fairs:\n\nIn the past years, the system has also been repeatedly displayed in clubs and discothèques, at LAN parties and at BDSM parties.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11334840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11334840", "title": "Poly-Turf", "text": "Poly-Turf\n\nPoly-Turf was a brand of artificial turf in the early 1970s, manufactured by American Biltrite of Wellesley, Massachusetts. It was the first specifically designed for American football, with a patented layered structure which included a \"shock pad\" between the artificial grass and the asphalt sub-surface. It used polypropylene for its artificial grass blades, rather than the nylon used in AstroTurf and 3M's Tartan Turf.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the natural grass surface at the Orange Bowl in Miami was commonly in poor condition, primarily due to heavy usage; 34 games were scheduled there during the 1968 football season.\n\nPoly-Turf was installed at the city-owned stadium in 1970, and utilized for six seasons. The stadium was used for both college and professional football, primarily by the University of Miami Hurricanes and the Miami Dolphins of the NFL. It also hosted the eponymous New Year's Day college bowl game, Super Bowl games, and high school football.\n\nThe University of Nebraska Cornhuskers won the first three Orange Bowl games played on Poly-Turf, which included two national championships. The first Super Bowl played on artificial turf was played on Poly-Turf in the Orange Bowl in January 1971, when the Baltimore Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys 16-13 in Super Bowl V. The next Super Bowl at the stadium was the final game played on Poly-Turf in Miami; Super Bowl X in January 1976. Its flaws received additional media exposure the week prior to the game, and Dolphins receiver Nat Moore documented them in a local article.\n\nThe longer polypropylene blades of Poly-Turf tended to mat down and become very slick under hot & sunny conditions. Other NFL owners were skeptical of the brand before the first regular season games were played in 1970. The field was replaced after two seasons, before the Dolphins' 1972 undefeated season. It was replaced by another Poly-Turf surface. While it had similar problems, it lasted longer than the first installation, and was used for four years. Over just six years, both installations deteriorated rapidly and some football players suffered an increasing number of leg and ankle injuries; some players claimed to trip over seams. Prior to the second installation in 1972, the city did not consult with the Dolphins about the replacement; head coach Dolphins' coach Don Shula preferred a different brand, either AstroTurf or Tartan Turf. The field discolored from green to blue due to the severe UV nature of the Miami sun.\n\nThe city removed the Poly-Turf in 1976 and re-installed natural grass, a special type known as Prescription Athletic Turf (PAT), which remained until the stadium's closure in early 2008. As late as December 1975, the city had planned to retain the Poly-Turf for the 1976 season, but that decision was changed a few weeks later, prior to the Super Bowl. \n\nThe Orange Bowl became the first major football venue to replace its artificial turf with natural grass, and it was the third NFL stadium to install Prescription Athletic Turf; Denver's Mile High Stadium and Washington's RFK Stadium installed PAT fields a year earlier in the spring of 1975.\n\nOther NFL stadiums which installed Poly-Turf included Schaefer Stadium, opened in 1971 for the New England Patriots, and Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, home of the Saints, Tulane University, and the Sugar Bowl. Notable college stadiums included Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama and Alumni Stadium at Boston College.\n\nAmerican Biltrite ceased production of Poly-Turf in 1973; 3M stopped the manufacture of its Tartan Turf in 1974, citing rising oil prices. This left AstroTurf as the only major manufacturer of artificial turf until FieldTurf was started in the late 1990s.\n"}

{"id": "28422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28422", "title": "Slingshot", "text": "Slingshot\n\nA gallybander slingshot or catapult (UK), ging (primarily Australian and New Zealand), shanghai (Australian), kettie (South Africa), is normally a small hand-powered projectile weapon. The classic form consists of a Y-shaped frame held in the off hand (nondominant hand), with two natural-rubber strips attached to the uprights. The other ends of the strips lead back to a pocket that holds the projectile. The dominant hand grasps the pocket and draws it back to the desired extent to provide power for the projectile—up to a full span of the arm with sufficiently long bands.\n\nSlingshots depend on strong elastic materials, typically vulcanized natural rubber or the equivalent, and thus date no earlier than the invention of vulcanized rubber by Charles Goodyear in 1839 (patented in 1844). By 1860, this \"new engine\" had already established a reputation for juvenile use in vandalism. For much of their early history, slingshots were a \"do-it-yourself\" item, typically made from a forked branch to form the \"Y\" shaped handle, with rubber strips sliced from items as inner tubes or other sources of good vulcanized rubber and firing suitably sized stones.\n\nWhile early slingshots were most associated with young vandals, they were also capable hunting arms in the hands of a skilled user. Firing projectiles, such as lead musket balls, buckshot, steel ball bearings, air gun pellets, or small nails, slingshot was capable of taking game such as quail, pheasant, rabbit, dove, and squirrel. Placing multiple balls in the pouch produces a shotgun effect, such as firing a dozen BBs at a time for hunting small birds. With the addition of a suitable rest, the slingshot can also be used to shoot arrows, allowing the hunting of medium-sized game at short ranges.\n\nWhile commercially made slingshots date from at least 1918, with the introduction of the Zip-Zip, a cast iron model, it was not until the post World War II years saw a surge in the popularity, and legitimacy, of slingshots. They were still primarily a home-built proposition; a 1946 Popular Science article details a slingshot builder and hunter using home-built slingshots made from forked dogwood sticks to take small game at ranges of up to with No. 0 lead buckshot ( diameter).\n\nThe Wham-O company, founded in 1948, was named after their first product, the Wham-O slingshot. It was made of ash wood and used flat rubber bands. The Wham-O was suitable for hunting with a draw weight of up to , and was available with an arrow rest.\n\nThe 1940s also saw the creation of the National Slingshot Association, headquartered in San Marino, California, which organised slingshot clubs and competitions nationwide. Despite the slingshot's reputation as a tool of juvenile delinquents, the NSA reported that 80% of slingshot sales were to men over 30 years old, many of them professionals. John Milligan, a part-time manufacturer of the aluminium-framed John Milligan Special, a hunting slingshot, reported that about a third of his customers were physicians.\n\nThe middle 1950s saw two major innovations in slingshot manufacture, typified by the Wrist-Rocket Company of Columbus, Nebraska, later renamed Trumark. The Wrist-Rocket was made from bent aluminium alloy rods that formed not only the handle and fork, but also a brace that extended backwards over the wrist, and provided support on the forearm to counter the torque of the bands. The Wrist-Rocket also used surgical rubber tubing rather than flat bands, attached to the backwards-facing fork ends by sliding the tubing ends over the tips of the forks, where it was held by friction or adhered with the addition of liquid rosin.\n\nSlingshots are also occasionally used in angling to disperse bait into the water over a wide area, so that multiple fish are attracted near the angler's fishing rod.\n\nA home-made derivative of a slingshot also exists, consisting of a rubber balloon cut in half and tied to a tubular object such as the neck of a plastic bottle, or a small pipe. The projectile is inserted through the tube and into the cut balloon, and the user stretches the balloon to launch the projectile. These so-called \"balloon guns\" are sometimes made as a substitute to ordinary slingshot, and is often used to create the \"shotgun\" effect with multiple projectiles fired at once.\n\nThe world record for the most energetic shot with a handheld slingshot was 135 Joules. It was shot with a forward extended slingshot, also known as a \"starship\", which achieves more power by increasing draw length.\n\nSlingshots have been used as military weapons, but primarily by guerrilla forces due to the primitive resources and technology required to construct one. Such guerrilla groups included the Irish Republican Army; prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Saddam Hussein released a propaganda video demonstrating slingshots as a possible insurgency weapon for use against invading forces.\n\nSlingshots have also been used by the military to launch unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Two crew members form the fork, with an elastic cord stretched between them to provide power to launch the small aircraft.\n\nOn the Battle of Marawi, the soldiers of the Philippine Army's elite Scout Rangers were observed using slingshots with grenades as an improvised mortar to eliminate the Maute and Abu Sayyaf Terrorists.\n\nOne of the dangers inherent in slingshots is the high probability that the bands will fail. Most bands are made from latex, which degrades with time and use, causing the bands to eventually fail under load. Failures at the pouch end are safest, as they result in the band rebounding away from the user. Failures at the fork end, however, send the band back towards the shooter's face, which can cause eye and facial injuries. One method to minimize the chance of a fork end failure is to utilize a tapered band, thinner at the pouch end, and thicker and stronger at the fork end. Designs that use loose parts at the fork are the most dangerous, as they can result in those parts being propelled back towards the shooter's face, such as the ball attachment used in the recalled Daisy \"Natural\" line of slingshots (see image). The band could slip out of the slot in which it rested, and the hard ball in the tube resulted in cases of blindness and broken teeth. Daisy models using plain tubular bands were not covered in the recall, because the elastic tubing does not cause severe injuries upon failure. Another big danger is the fork breakage, some commercial slingshots made from cheap zinc alloy may break and severely injure shooters' eyes & face. \n\nMany jurisdictions prohibit the use of arm braced slingshots. For example, New York law 265.01 defines it as a Class-4 misdemeanor.\n\n"}

{"id": "553322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=553322", "title": "Ten Tors", "text": "Ten Tors\n\nTen Tors is an annual weekend hike in early May, on Dartmoor, southwest England. Organised by the British Army, starting in 1960, it brings together teams of four to six young people each, with the 2,400 young participants hiking to checkpoints on ten specified tors. The majority of entrants are schools, colleges, Scout groups and Cadet squadrons from South West England, though groups from across the UK have regularly taken part, as have teams from Australia and New Zealand. However, from 2012 only teams from the South West of England are eligible to take part, due to the large numbers of entrants. Teams will train for a few months before the event.\n\nTeams of six are required to visit ten specified tors; on the top of each tor is a checkpoint. Up to two members per team may fall out during the Challenge; teams falling below this number could merge in earlier years, while later rules required a badly reduced team to forfeit.\n\nThere are 26 different routes over three different distances, lettered from A to Z, using a total of 19 different manned tors: 12 Bronze (Junior) routes of for those aged 14 to 15 years; 10 Silver ( Intermediate) routes of for those aged 16 to 17 years; and 4 Gold ( Senior or Arduous) routes of for those aged 18 to 19 years, or 17-year-olds who completed a Silver or Bronze route previously.\n\nThe organisers stress that the event is not a race – although teams often compete to see who can finish first – but a test of endurance, navigation and survival skills, because of not just the distances and the challenging terrain, but potentially also the weather; conditions on Dartmoor can vary considerably and change suddenly. In 1996, for example, the event was struck by a heavy snow storm, leading to some teams still being out on the moor a day after the event was due to have finished; while in 1998 temperatures reached 26 °C (79 °F).\n\nParticipants arrive at Okehampton Camp on the Thursday or Friday before the hike, watch a safety briefing video and have their equipment checked, a thorough process known as scrutineering. Teams must carry all their food, clothing, tents, stoves, fuel, navigation equipment, maps, emergency rations and a first aid kit; they also collect drinking water from the moor and use water purification tablets. Each team has a nominated team leader, who is responsible for ensuring that the team's route card is stamped at each tor.\n\nAll the teams start at 0700 on the Saturday from an area of flat land next to Anthony Stile, close to Okehampton Camp on the northern edge of Dartmoor. They stand in a semicircle and set off when a cannon fires. They have 34 hours to visit each of the ten tors on their route in the correct order. Teams must not pass through a checkpoint between 2000 on Saturday and 0600 on Sunday morning; nor may they pass the ninth tor (eighth for the 35 mile routes) until the Sunday. Those trying for a Bronze medal must camp at one of the manned tors on their route, while Silver and Gold teams may camp anywhere on the moor. Teams must arrive back at Anthony Stile by 1700 on the Sunday, having visited all ten tors on their route in order, to qualify for a medal. (and a team certificate if the whole team make it )\n\nThe first Ten Tors Expedition took place in September 1960, with around 200 young people taking part. By 1980, the numbers had grown to more than 2,600. To protect the environment, the numbers are now limited to 2,400 individuals: 400 teams of four to six teenagers. The Army uses the event as a large scale logistics training exercise.\n\nUntil 1967 the event was organised by the Junior Leaders Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals. This responsibility passed to Headquarters South West District, and in 1986 to 43 (Wessex) Brigade, the regional Headquarters of the Territorial Army in the South West.\n\nSince 1977 an additional event, The Jubilee Challenge, has been held for young people with physical or learning disabilities. This involves a selection of four routes of between , both on road and cross-country.\n\nMany military units and civilian groups provide support for this event and the Jubilee Challenge, including the Royal Wessex Yeomanry, Exeter UOTC, 243 Field Hospital RAMC, 6th Battalion The Rifles, two Sea King HC4 helicopters from 848 Naval Air Squadron, 39 (Skinners) Signal Regiment, two Gazelle helicopters from 7 Regiment Army Air Corps (Volunteers), Bristol UOTC and the Dartmoor Rescue Group.\n\nThe first ever Junior Army Team from Junior Leaders Regiment Royal Armoured Corps JLR RAC finished the Gold Course with 24 minutes to spare, despite several of the six-strong team having severe foot injuries. They were cheered home by an honour guard of Royal Marines and Paratroopers who walked with the boys over the last mile.\n\n\"Tavistock Times\" reports \"Hurricane Force\" winds during the event.\n\nA cold northerly wind on the Saturday of the 1996 event turned to rain and snow overnight. This continued through Sunday, accompanied by fog and driving wind. Requests from Tor party commanders, two of whom had their tents destroyed, added to pressure to abandon the event, and there was a mass evacuation of the moor on the Sunday afternoon, the first time the event had been terminated early. Fifty-one teams completed their routes, but no record remains of their success. Ten Tors, A History\n\nTen Tors was cancelled in 2001 due to the foot and mouth epidemic, but went ahead the next year.\n\nFor the second year in succession the Plymouth DofE Award 45 team took the honour of leading the teams over the finish line, at 08:49 (Ten Tors Teams, 2003), improving on their time of 09:23 in 2002 (Ten Tors Teams, 2002)\n\nIn 2004 the Ten Tors record for earliest complete team home was broken by R1809, Dartmoor Plodders, with a time of 08:19. This stood until 2009.\n\nIn 2005, one of the original teams from the 1960 Ten Tors took part in the event, which was held on 14–15 May in particularly adverse weather conditions: constant rain on the Saturday, combined with a bitter wind, leading to an unusually high number of retirements.\n\nIn 2006, the event was held over the weekend of 13–14 May, with high temperatures on the Sunday resulting in several cases of dehydration.\n\nOn Sunday 4 March 2007, Charlotte Shaw was swept away by the rain-swollen Walla Brook near Watern Tor, while training for the event. The rest of her group raised the alarm using a mobile phone, but despite her being evacuated by a Royal Navy helicopter within 20 minutes, she died later that night in Derriford Hospital, Plymouth. In December 2009 an inquest into the death was halted for the case to be considered for criminal charges. Several other groups were also evacuated by helicopter after weather conditions on Dartmoor deteriorated.\n\nThe event itself was abandoned at 21:30 on Saturday 12 May 2007, halfway through, due to severe weather conditions; the decision was influenced by the high drop-out rate of 15% on Saturday. Participants spent the night camped at a manned Tor, before being escorted off the moor by the military the following day.\n\nFrom 2008 the event was much changed, with different routes and use of the moor to help bird conservation in the nesting season. Steeperton Tor and Hare Tor were dropped from the Tor list, and the pass from Dinger to Kitty Tor known as \"Death Valley\" was zoned off limits. Each team was permitted only four training walks on the north moor. A review of these changes . The 2008 event was a total contrast to the previous years, with temperatures in the low 20s Celsius, and participants dropping out because of dehydration rather than hypothermia.\n\nThe first team across the line was the 20th Torbay Explorer Scouts, finishing at 09:10.\n\nIn 2009 the Ten Tors' record for the earliest complete team home since the rule change was broken with a time of 08:17 by 20th Torbay Explorer Scouts.\nFor the first time an all-girls team, from Torquay Grammar School for Girls also broke the record for successfully completing the 35-, 45- and 55-mile events consecutively and with the same team members (Tamsin Owen, Joyce Nie, Francesca Hill, Amelia Skerritt, Rebecca Stanley and Hannah Short).\nThere were fewer dropouts than in other years in almost perfect weather conditions.\n\n2010 saw the 50th anniversary of the Ten Tors event. To mark the occasion the Duke of Edinburgh visited the event on Sunday morning to speak to finishers and present some with the commemorative 50 years medals. It also marked the first year that teams carried a GPS tracker which enabled the organisers and team managers to track the participants' progress directly. The first finishers were 20th Torbay Explorer Scouts (Joshua Owen, Matthew Ryder, Luke Hayward, Jacob Shah, Paul Moroz and William Fordyce) and King Edward's School Bath who walked over the line together at 7.37 to break the record for earliest finishers by 40 minutes, and also finishing four and a half hours ahead of any other team on their route. This also meant the scout group had crossed the line first for three consecutive years. Notable other finishers were the 'Denbury Boys' who, made up of men who completed the first ever Ten Tors, successfully completed the 35 mile event.\n\nThe 2011 Challenge started under a clear blue sky, but cloud obscured the tops of *West Mill and *High Willhays even then. Cloud and a fresh breeze built up through the day, but by 17:50 a blue sky was breaking through. Sunday was very similar with the first finishers (M1306 - Downend Scouts, at 08:35 Route M listing, 2011) walking in under a blue sky, but again the cloud gathered through the day. Notes from the Event.\n\nThe largely overcast and cool weekend was almost perfect walking weather - of the 390 teams which started 374 (95%) walked over the finish line, and of those finishing teams 316 (81%) walked in with all six team members. Over the last fifteen years of the event this is the highest percentage of both Finishing and Complete teams. Sixteen teams either retired (just 7, less than 2%) or were 'crashed out', but even here the statistics are impressive – in the previous 15 years teams are noted as stopping at their second Tor onwards. In 2011 the first teams to stop reached their fifth Tor before doing so.\n\nIt was also the 60th anniversary of Dartmoor as a National Park so everyone received a participant certificate.\n\nThe first team to reach the finish line was the Torquay Boys' Grammar School 45-mile team, who reached camp at 8:56am.\n\nThey were soon followed by both Torbay Explorer Scouts and Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School 45-mile team, who performed an excellent display of sportsmanship by finishing the last kilometre of the course side by side, despite a failure in the alarm of the QEH team, delaying the team by a full hour.\n\nThe first 35-mile team to cross the finish was Churcher's College, Hampshire, getting back to cap with a record breaking time of 09:21 on the Sunday morning. This was also the first all-boy team to cross the finish, and second overall.\n\nThe first all-girl team to reach the finish line, The Maynard 35-mile team, got back to camp at 10:20, setting a new time record for the school. The Maynard 45-mile team also completed the challenge in a respectable time, finishing at 13:59.\n\nThe 2012 event was notable for the selfless efforts of one team, X2414 Kingsbridge Community College (55), who were on schedule to complete their route shortly after 16:00 when they diverted to answer the distress whistles of another team which had two of its members trapped chest deep in Raybarrow Pool. After calling in the Dartmoor Rescue Group and helping the other team, X2414 walked in at 17:19, almost twenty minutes after the close of the event - this would normally debar a team from receiving their awards. The Director Ten Tors, Brigadier Piers Hankinson, met the team at the finish and presented Kingsbridge with their gold medals.\n\nThe event weather, following days of heavy rain, was cloudless, sunny and warm with 100% visibility. Notes from the Event, 2012\n\nThe 2013 event went down in Ten Tors history as one of the most miserable. Organisers said that if the weather had come a day earlier then the event would have been cancelled. Swollen rivers from rain over the previous weeks meant that river crossings were hazardous; teams were offered advice on the best places to cross by Dartmoor Mountain Rescue. Some young people stayed at river crossings for a number of hours, selflessly helping others to cross whilst putting their own chances of finishing on hold.\n\nEspecially on Saturday, navigation became extremely difficult as fog and mist reduced visibility to as low as 10 metres: a few less experienced 35 mile teams did not even make their first tor. The weather lifted overnight and gave teams a break from the rain, but this brought near-freezing temperatures across the whole moor. Throughout Sunday the weather worsened again.\n\nQueen Elizabeth's Hospital School 45 mile team S1915 were the first team to make it across the finish line on the Sunday morning at 9:20, over four hours ahead of any other team on their route.\n\nTeams often choose odd dress code for crossing the finishing line. School uniform, kilts, miniskirts and Chinese dragons have all featured in the past. However, this year, the Launceston College 45 mile team decided to cross the line in brightly coloured morphsuits. Whilst the rain was beginning to lash down and the traditional Dartmoor high winds persisted, the team sacrificed their finishing time (12:15) to show the spirit and good humour that makes Ten Tors.\nThe finishing gate was left open for an extra 45 minutes. By 11:00 on Sunday morning, over 300 people had dropped out, and by the end of the day the number of people who would not complete had increased to over 500.\n\n(81% finished complete) The first team to finish was the 35 mile CCF team from Churcher's College, Petersfield, Hants. They came over the line at 8.56am and was a mixed team: Olivia Hart, Francesca Hussell, Jerome Greig, Ben Kelson, Edward Rodge and Owen Tutt, around 45 minutes ahead of all other teams. In the 55 mile event, Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School were the first to finish, followed a whole two minutes later by the slower King Edward's school.\n\n(73.7% complete 18.9% with fall-outs) \n\nSecond time in a row the first team to finish was the 35 mile CCF team from Churcher's College, Petersfield, Hants. They crossed the finish line at 9.10am on a foggy Sunday morning consisting of 14- to 15-year-old boys: Julian Greig, Dylan Joseph, Joe Keohane, Archie Moffat, Sam Mullender and Jack Stubbings. Second across was Kingswood School, Bath at 9.13.\n\nThis was the 55th anniversary of Ten Tors, and to celebrate this, two teams of veterans were given special permission to take part. They did one of the 55 mile routes on the 55th anniversary, all aged over 55 (some considerably so). Most of them had completed Ten Tors as teenagers in the 1970s whilst at school in Exeter, but none had had the opportunity to do the 55 mile route. Apart from being too old, they followed all the rules, carrying all the same equipment as the young people. Both teams completed the challenge complete; fourteen veterans in all, albeit fairly late in the day on the Sunday.\n\n(73% complete 21 with fall-outs) \n\n2016 saw warmer weather, getting up to 20 °C across the moor. The first team to cross the finish line was Torbay Scouts who took part in the 35-mile (56 km) route at 8:51, followed by Monkton Combe CCF (8:59) The National Trust Dartmoor (9:03) (1 hr 50 ahead of anyone else on their route) KES Bath (9:08) and Exeter School's Blackdown Hikers A (9:10) (2 hrs 10 ahead of anyone else on their route). The first 55-mile team to cross the finish line was Colyton Grammar School. They crossed the finish line at 10:52, team consisting of: Matt Domhof, Frank Hartley, Charlie King, Zoe Kuyken, Ellie Marok and Jonny Surtees. At 13:25 a 45-mile team from Kingswood Explorer Scouts came across the line sporting very groovy Hawaiian outfits which was very fitting in the glorious sunshine.\n\nThe event also generated a light-hearted news story when the downdraught from a low-flying Royal Navy Merlin Mk3 helicopter blew away a row of portable toilets. They were not occupied at the time and there were no injuries.\n\nAdults were awarded for long service to Ten Tors with 1 40+ Platinum award, 1 30+ Diamond award and 5 20+ gold awards, including Jack Barker, from the Erme and Yealm Hillwalking Club/Ivybridge Community College receiving the Platinum and Diamond; plus Paul Johnson & Peter Challiss from Tavistock & District Youth Forum.\n\nThe event had the perfect weather conditions, with it not being too cold or too hot, leading to 84.9% of teams reaching the finish line complete. \nFirst to finish were 20th Torbay Scouts, arriving back at the base camp at 08:19 Sunday, followed by Torquay Boys' Grammar School B at 08:37, who finished almost an hour before anyone else on their route after walking for 2.5 hours. The first 55-mile team was that of Torquay Boys' Grammar School A, consisting of Joe Kingdon, Tom Snow, Matt Birdsall, Adam White, Harry Fox and Tom Gregory. They finished at 9:54, beating the previously held record for Route X, introduced in 2014, by 1hr35mins.\n\nThe tors used as checkpoints on the Ten Tors challenge in 2013 were as follows, but this is being changed for the 2014 event.\n\nAll the above tors are staffed by volunteers: ten are manned by personnel from the Royal Air Force and nine by Royal Navy colleagues.\n\nThe following tors are no longer used because of bird nesting:\n\nAll tors on the south moor have been removed after 2014, replaced by Peat Cot, south of Princetown, and new Safety Checkpoints were put in place to ensure the safety of participants, providing road access to the checkpoint for potential drop outs during the event.\n\nNew Checkpoints/Safety Checkpoints for the event from 2014 onwards are: \n\nEvery year before the start of the event the following prayer is read.\n\n<poem>O God who has made the Earth of great beauty,\nand who has given us the Spirit of Adventure,\nwe thank you for the beauty of the world,\nfor the courage and vigour of young people,\nfor the companionship and for the opportunity\nto enjoy all these gifts.\n\nWe pray that you will keep them safe on this great venture\nand grant that they may meet each challenge\nand difficulty with unselfish courage and so find the\ntrue spirit of comradeship as shown to us by\nJesus Christ, our Lord. Amen </poem>\n\nSince 1977 the Jubilee Challenge has been run as an additional event: it is a shorter version of the Ten Tors for competitors who are impaired in some way (by either severe learning difficulties or physical disability). The Jubilee Challenge takes place on the Saturday, over distances of 7.5, 8.5, 11, and 15 miles.\n\n\n"}

It is the home field of the Cedar Rapids Kernels of the Midwest League. It is often called New Veterans Memorial Stadium to distinguish it from the original Veterans Memorial Stadium, which existed from 1949 to 2001.\n\nVeterans Memorial Stadium is located southwest of downtown Cedar Rapids on Rockford Road. The Cedar Rapids Ice Arena and Kingston Stadium, home to Kennedy, Jefferson, and Washington high school football, are both adjacent to Veterans Memorial Stadium.\n\nVeterans Memorial Stadium has a total seating capacity of 5,300. It has 12 luxury suites and several sections that are reserved for group outings, including a mezzanine terrace in the upper deck behind first base, a pavilion in left field, and a pre-game picnic area.\n\nIn addition to Kernels games, Veterans Memorial Stadium hosted the Midwest League All-Star Game in 2004, and again in 2016. On July 9, 2005, the stadium hosted its first concert, featuring Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson. The American Legion World Series was held there in 2006. It is also occasionally used for high school and college baseball games, including the annual Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference baseball tournament. It hosted the annual \"Corridor Classic\" between the Iowa Hawkeyes and the Northern Iowa Panthers until the University of Northern Iowa discontinued its baseball program.\n\nThe city of Cedar Rapids owns Veterans Memorial Stadium, which was named to honor veterans of all wars, and the city's Veterans Memorial Commission operates and maintains the stadium. The Linn County All Veterans Memorial is located next to the stadium. In March 2004 the Kernels and the city agreed to a new 40-year lease agreement that reduced the ballclub's monthly payments from the original 20-year agreement that they had signed when the new stadium opened.\n\nIn March 2008 the Kernels sold the naming rights of the playing field to the Dale and Thomas Popcorn Company. The playing field was known as Dale and Thomas Popcorn Field at Veterans Memorial Stadium for the 2008 season. The field was renamed Perfect Game Field at Veterans Memorial Stadium when Perfect Game USA, a baseball scouting company based in Cedar Rapids, bought the naming rights to the field in March 2009 in a five-year contract.\n\nIn 2017, the stadium won a bid to host the NCAA Division III College World Series from 2019 to 2022, after long time host of the event the Fox Cities Stadium in Grand Chute, WI chose not to bid on the rights to host the event after 2018.\n\nThe original Veterans Memorial Stadium was built in 1949 for the Cedar Rapids Rockets of the Central Association. It later became home to the Cedar Rapids Indians (1950–1952), the Cedar Rapids Raiders (1953–1957), and the Cedar Rapids Braves (1958–1961) of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. From 1962 until its demolition, Cedar Rapids' Midwest League teams—which went through several name changes before becoming the Kernels in 1993—played their home games there.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Veterans Memorial Stadium failed to meet many of Major League Baseball's new standards for minor league parks as newer facilities were opening in other Midwest League cities. On August 15, 2000, Cedar Rapids voters approved a referendum that helped provide some of the money needed to build a new ballpark adjacent to the old one. (Other funds came from the state of Iowa, the Kernels ballclub, and private donations.) The last game at the old Veterans Memorial Stadium was played on August 28, 2001, with the Kernels defeating the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, 4–1. The stadium was demolished shortly afterwards and the site now serves as a parking lot for the new stadium.\n\nThe new Veterans Memorial Stadium was dedicated on April 7, 2002, but that day's scheduled game against the Quad City River Bandits was rained out. The first games were not played until April 9, when the Kernels swept a doubleheader from the River Bandits, 5–4 and 3–0.\n\n"}

{"id": "2093931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2093931", "title": "Wife-carrying", "text": "Wife-carrying\n\nWife carrying (, , ) is a contest in which male competitors race while each carrying a female teammate. The objective is for the male to carry the female through a special obstacle track in the fastest time. The sport was first introduced at Sonkajärvi, Finland.\n\nSeveral types of carry may be practised: piggyback, fireman's carry (over the shoulder), or Estonian-style (the wife hangs upside-down with her legs around the husband's shoulders, holding onto his waist).\n\nThe Wife Carrying World Championships have been held annually in Sonkajärvi, Finland, since 1992 (where the prize is the wife's weight in beer).\n\nEukonkanto originated in Finland. Tales have been passed down of a man named Herkko Rosvo-Ronkainen (aka Ronkainen the Robber). This man was considered a robber in the late 1800s, lived in a forest, and ran around with his gang of thieves causing harm to the villages. From what has been found, there are three ideas as to why/how this sport was invented. Firstly, that Rosvo-Ronkainen and his thieves were accused of stealing food and women from villages in the area he lived in, then carrying these women on their backs as they ran away (hence the \"wife\" or woman carrying). The second suggestion is that young men would go to neighbouring villages, steal other men’s wives to marry themselves. These wives were also carried on the backs of the young men; this was referred to as “the practice of wife stealing\". Lastly, is the idea that Rosvo-Ronkainen trained his thieves to be \"faster and stronger\" by carrying big, heavy sacks on their backs, from which evolved this sport. Though the sport is often considered a joke, competitors take it very seriously, just like any other sport.\n\nWife carrying contests are now seen in Australia, the United States, Hong Kong, Estonia, the UK and other parts of the world besides Finland, and the sport has a category in the \"Guinness Book of Records\".\n\nThe original course was a rough, rocky terrain with fences and brooks, but it has been altered to suit modern conditions. There is now sand instead of full rocks, fences, and some kind of area filled with water (a pool). These are the following rules set by the International Wife Carrying Competition Rules Committee:\nWhile the International rules are the basis for all competitions, rules and prizes do vary for each competition.\n\n\nAustralian Wife Carrying Championships have been held annually since 2005.\n\nThe North American Wife Carrying Championships take place every year on Columbus Day Weekend in October at Sunday River Ski Resort in Newry, Maine.\n\nThe United Kingdom Wife Carrying Race was established in 2008, though the \"sport\" is claimed to have taken place \"with help from our Scandinavian cousins\" for around 300 years from 793AD when Viking raiders raided villages and abducted wives. \n\n\nThe US final takes place on the second weekend of July in Menahga Minnesota (MN-St. Urho Wife Carry for Charity Challenge).\nMajor wife-carrying competitions are also held in Monona, Wisconsin, Minocqua, Wisconsin and Marquette, Michigan.\n\nEcorun India, a society for creating environmental awareness organized Wife Carrying Race in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India, Asia on 1 January 2011. The event is called \"Bhaaryaasametham\" roughly translated as 'with your wife' in Malayalam, the local language. The society plans on conducting more such events every year in India. Wife carrying in Asia is also called matukinina.\n\nA Bollywood movie named Dum Laga Ke Haisha had \"wife carrying race\" in its backdrop.\n\n\n\n"}
