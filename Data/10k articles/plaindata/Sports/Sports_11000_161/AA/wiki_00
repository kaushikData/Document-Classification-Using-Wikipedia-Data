When thrown against a hard surface, bouncy balls retain their momentum and much of their kinetic energy (or, if dropped, convert much of their potential energy to kinetic energy). They can thus rebound with an appreciable fraction of their original force.\n\nSolid rubber balls such as the Spaldeen (a corruption of Spalding, the manufacturer), about the size of a tennis ball and often colored pink, have been manufactured since the 1930s and remain so into the 21st century. They were fundamental to the development of American street games such as stickball, in addition to other uses in play. Other manufacturers have made similar balls, such as the Pensie Pinkie.\n\nA superball or power ball is a bouncy ball of composed of a type of synthetic rubber (originally a hard elastomer Polybutadiene alloy named Zectron) invented in 1964, with has a higher coefficient of restitution (0.92) than older balls such as the Spaldeen, so that when dropped from moderate height onto a level hard surface, it wall bounce nearly all the way back up. They were first sold by the Wham-O toy company under the name Super Ball, which remains their trademark. Superballs are often smaller than a Spaldeen.\n\nSkyball is a brand of hollow medium-sized bouncy ball filled with a mix of helium and compressed air, claimed by the manufacturer to have particularly good bounce characteristics. Nerf balls, introduced in 1970, are also small balls that bounce, but they have a lower coefficient of restitution than a typical bouncy ball. Balls similar in size and composition to Spaldeens, but featuring a plethora of designs (such as a baseball pattern, miniature basketball and soccer ball patterns, and so forth) are offered by many companies. Due to their low cost per unit, bouncy balls with logos or other designs are sometimes used as promotional merchandise. Bouncy balls may, by means of fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or motion-activated LEDs, emit light; such balls are called glow balls. Balls composed of many rubber bands, or bouncy balls made of borax, glue, and cornstarch, are sometimes homemade. Bouncy balls are often used in juggling.\n\n\n\n"}

Directed and co-written by John Lasseter from a screenplay by Dan Fogelman, it is Pixar's final independently-produced film before its purchase by Disney in May 2006. Set in a world populated entirely by anthropomorphic cars and other vehicles, the film stars the voices of Owen Wilson, Paul Newman (in his final acting role), Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Tony Shalhoub, Cheech Marin, Michael Wallis, George Carlin, Paul Dooley, Jenifer Lewis, Guido Quaroni, Michael Keaton, Katherine Helmond, John Ratzenberger and Richard Petty. Race car drivers Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Mario Andretti, Michael Schumacher and car enthusiast Jay Leno (as \"Jay Limo\") voice themselves.\n\n\"Cars\" premiered on May 26, 2006 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina and was theatrically released in the United States on June 9, 2006 to critical and commercial success, grossing $462.2 million worldwide against a budget of $120 million. It was nominated for two Academy Awards including Best Animated Feature and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. The film was released on DVD on November 7, 2006 and on Blu-ray in 2007. The film was accompanied by the short \"One Man Band\" for its theatrical and home media releases. Merchandise based on the film (including scale models of several of the cars) broke records for retail sales of merchandise based on a Disney/Pixar film, bringing an estimated $10 billion for 5 years after the film's release. The film was dedicated to Joe Ranft, the film's co-director and co-writer, who died in a car accident during the film's production.\n\nA sequel titled \"Cars 2\" was released on June 24, 2011 and a spin-off film titled \"Planes\" and produced by Disneytoon Studios was released on August 9, 2013, which was followed by its own sequel, \"\", released on July 18, 2014. A series of short animated films titled \"Cars Toons\" debuted in 2008 on Disney Channel and Disney XD. A second sequel, \"Cars 3\", was released on June 16, 2017.\n\nIn a world populated by anthropomorphic talking vehicles, the last race of the Piston Cup championship ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran Strip \"The King\" Weathers, infamous runner-up Chick Hicks and rookie Lightning McQueen. The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway in California. McQueen is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a bumper ointment company, and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, Mack drifts off, and is startled by a gang of four reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, but instead ends up lost in the run-down desert town of Radiator Springs, where he inadvertently ruins the pavement of its main road by accident.\n\nAfter being arrested, impounded overnight and guarded by a rusty yet friendly tow truck named Mater, McQueen is ordered by the town judge Doc Hudson to leave town immediately. However, the local lawyer Sally Carrera, requests that McQueen should instead be given community service to repave the road to which Doc reluctantly agrees. McQueen tries to repave the road in a single day but it turns out shoddy, forcing him to repave the road again. During this time, he befriends several of the cars and learns that Radiator Springs used to be a popular stopover along the old U.S. Route 66 but with the construction of Interstate 40 bypassing it, the town literally vanished from the map. McQueen also discovers that Doc is the \"Fabulous Hudson Hornet\", a three-time Piston Cup winner whose racing career ended after an accident in 1954 after which he was quickly forgotten by the sport. McQueen finishes repaving the road which has invigorated the cars to improve their town and spends an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on the town led by a tip to McQueen's location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race while Sally chastises Doc upon discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueen's whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered by them instead.\n\nAt the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is not fully set on the race due to him missing Sally and his other new friends and he soon falls into last place. He is surprised to discover that Doc, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief along with several other cars from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute Hicks (refusing to come behind Weathers again) side swipes Weathers and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line which allows Hicks to win and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's good sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines by insisting on staying with Rust-eze as an appreciation of their past support. Back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns to reunite with Sally and announces that he will be setting up his racing headquarters, thereby putting Radiator Springs back on the map.\n\n\nTom Hanks, Tim Allen, Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and Dave Foley reprise their vocal roles from previous Pixar films during an end-credits sequence featuring automobile spoofs of \"Toy Story\", \"Monsters, Inc.\", and \"A Bug's Life\".\n\n\"Cars\" was the final Pixar film worked on by Joe Ranft who died in a car accident a year before the film's release, aged 45. The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory, after \"Corpse Bride\" (that showed the roles he had done in the other films directed by John Lasseter during the credits). This is also the last (non-documentary) movie for Paul Newman before his retirement in 2007 and his death in 2008. It turned out to be the highest-grossing film of his career.\n\nThe genesis of the film came in 1998 as Pixar began wrapping up production on \"A Bug's Life\". At that time Jorgen Klubien began writing a script called \"The Yellow Car\" which was about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world, inspired by \"The Ugly Duckling\", an idea triggered by the poor reception his fellow countrymen gave the Mini-El car. Some of the original drawings and characters were developed in 1998 and the producers agreed that \"Cars\" could be the next film after \"A Bug's Life\" and would be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4. However, the idea was scrapped in favor of \"Toy Story 2\". Later, production resumed with major script changes like giving Mater, Doc and a few other characters a bigger part.\n\nJohn Lasseter said that inspiration for the film's story came after he took a cross-country road trip with his wife and five sons in 2000. When he returned to the studio after vacation, he contacted Michael Wallis, a Route 66 historian. Wallis then led eleven Pixar animators in rented white Cadillacs on two different road trips across the route to research the film. In 2001, the film's working title was \"Route 66\" (after U.S. Route 66) but the title was changed to \"Cars\" in order to avoid confusion with the 1960s television series of the same name. In addition, Lightning McQueen's number was originally going to be 57 (Lasseter's birth year) but was changed to 95 (the year \"Toy Story\" was released).\n\nIn 2006, Lasseter spoke about the inspiration for the film, saying: \"I have always loved cars. In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis.\"\n\nIn 2013, Klubien said the movie was both his best and most bitter experience because he was fired before it premiered and because he feels Lasseter wrote him out of the story of how the film got made.\n\nFor the cars themselves, Lasseter also visited the design studios of the Big Three Detroit automakers, particularly J Mays of Ford Motor Company. Lasseter learned how real cars were designed.\n\nIn 2006, Lasseter spoke about how they worked hard to make the animation believable, saying: \"It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator to be able to put some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way.\"\n\nUnlike most anthropomorphic cars, the eyes of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the Tonka Talking Trucks, the characters from Tex Avery's \"One Cab's Family\" short and Disney's own \"Susie the Little Blue Coupe\"), rather than within the headlights. According to production designer Bob Pauley, \"From the very beginning of this project, John Lasseter had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at the front end of the car feels more like a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character. This decision was heavily criticized by automotive blog Jalopnik.\n\nIn 2006, supervising animator on the film Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: \"Getting a full range of performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have.\" Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: \"It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the \"Cars\" models, than it did to interpret something like \"The Incredibles\" models. With \"The Incredibles\", the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with \"Cars\", it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right.\"\nLasseter also explained that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: \"Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins.\" Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: \"John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, they need to have that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy to the point where the audience might see them as rubber toys.\" According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, \"Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do.\"\n\nCharacter shading supervisor on the film Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges on the film, saying: \"Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning as much as we could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone.\" Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: \"Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for \"Cars\" we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar.\"\n\nRendering lead Jessica McMackin spoke about the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: \"In addition to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and you want to get a feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall.\" Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: \"The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On \"Cars\", this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it.\"\n\nTechnical director Lisa Forsell explained that to enhance the richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: \"Digital matte paintings are a way to get a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you’ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away.\"\n\nComputers used in the development of the film were four times faster than those used in \"The Incredibles\" and 1,000 times faster than those used in \"Toy Story\". To build the cars, the animators used computer platforms similar to those used in the design of real-world automobiles.\n\nThe \"Cars\" soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on June 6, 2006. Nine tracks on the soundtrack are by popular artists, while the remaining eleven are score cues by Randy Newman. It has two versions of the classic Bobby Troup jazz standard \"Route 66\" (popularized by Nat King Cole), one by Chuck Berry and a new version recorded specifically for the film's credits performed by John Mayer. Brad Paisley contributed two of the nine tracks to the album, one being \"Find Yourself\" used for the end credits.\n\n\"Cars\" was originally going to be released on November 4, 2005 but on December 7, 2004, its release date was changed to June 9, 2006. Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non-Disney materials to present to other studios or they were buying time to see what happened with Michael Eisner's situation at Disney. When Pixar's chief executive Steve Jobs made the release date announcement, he stated that the reasoning was due to wanting to put all Pixar films on a summer release schedule with DVD sales occurring during the holiday shopping season.\n\n\"Cars\" was released on DVD, in wide- and full-screen editions, on November 7, 2006 in the United States and Canada. This DVD was also released on October 25, 2006 in Australia and New Zealand and on November 27, 2006 in the United Kingdom. The release includes the DVD-exclusive short film \"Mater and the Ghostlight\" and the film's theatrical short \"One Man Band\" as well as a 16-minute-long documentary about the film entitled \"Inspiration for Cars\", which features director John Lasseter. It also featured the Pixar short \"Boundin'\".\n\nAccording to the Walt Disney Company, fivemillion copies of the DVD were sold the first two days it was available. The first week, it sold 6,250,856 units and 15,370,791 in total ($246,198,859). Unlike previous Pixar DVD releases, there is no two-disc special edition, and no plans to release one in the future. According to Sara Maher, DVD Production Manager at Pixar, John Lasseter and Pixar were preoccupied with productions like \"Ratatouille\".\n\nIn the US and Canada, there were bonus discs available with the purchase of the film at Wal-Mart and at Target. The former featured a \"Geared-Up Bonus DVD Disc\" that focused on the music of the film, including the music video to \"Life Is A Highway\", \"The Making of \"Life Is A Highway\"\", \"Cars: The Making of the Music\", and \"Under The Hood\", a special that originally aired on the ABC Family cable channel. The latter's bonus was a \"Rev'd Up DVD Disc\" that featured material mostly already released as part of the official \"Cars\" podcast and focused on the inspiration and production of the movie.\n\n\"Cars\" was also released on Blu-ray Disc on November 6, 2007, one year after the DVD release. It was the first Pixar film to be released on Blu-ray (alongside \"Ratatouille\" and \"Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1\"), and was re-released as a Blu-Ray Disc and DVD combo pack and DVD only edition in April 2011. The film was released for the first time in 3D on October 29, 2013, as part of \"Cars: Ultimate Collector's Edition\", which included the releases on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and DVD.\n\nA video game of the same name was released on June 6, 2006, for Game Boy Advance, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Xbox. It was also released on October 23, 2006, for Xbox 360 and November 16, 2006, for Wii. The video game got mainly positive reviews. GameSpot gave 7.0 out of 10 for Xbox 360 and Wii versions, for PlayStation 2, 7.6 out of 10 for the GameCube and Xbox versions, and 7.4 out of 10 for the PSP version. Metacritic gave 65 out of 100 for the Wii version, 54 out of 100 for the DS version, 73 out of 100 for the PC version, 71 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version, and 70 out of 100 for the PSP version.\n\n\"Cars\" was met with positive reviews. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 74% approval rating with an average rating of 6.9/10 based on 198 reviews. The site's consensus reads \"\"Cars\" offers visual treats that more than compensate for its somewhat thinly written story, adding up to a satisfying diversion for younger viewers.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 73 out of 100 based on 39 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nWilliam Arnold of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" praised it as \"one of Pixar's most imaginative and thoroughly appealing movies ever\" and Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it \"a work of American art as classic as it is modern.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying that the movie \"is great to look at and a lot of fun, but somehow lacks the extra push of the other Pixar films.

Lasseter loves these animated inanimate objects as though they were kin, and it shows in every beautifully rendered frame.\" Ella Taylor of \"L.A. Weekly\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"\"Cars\" cheerfully hitches cutting-edge animation to a folksy narrative plugging friendship, community and a Luddite mistrust of high tech.\"\n\nGene Seymour of \"Newsday\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"And as pop flies go, \"Cars\" is pretty to watch, even as it loops, drifts and, at times, looks as if it's just hanging in midair.\" Colin Covert of the \"Star Tribune\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"It takes everything that's made Pixar shorthand for animation excellence -- strong characters, tight pacing, spot-on voice casting, a warm sense of humor and visuals that are pure, pixilated bliss -- and carries them to the next stage.\" Bill Muller of \"The Arizona Republic\" gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"The truest measure of the movie is that eventually we forget we're watching a bunch of vehicles with faces and start to think of them as individual characters. It's quite an accomplishment, and perhaps one only possible by Pixar.\" Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"What's surprising about this supremely engaging film is the source of its curb appeal: It has heart.\" Stephen Hunter of \"The Washington Post\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"It's the latest concoction from the geniuses at Pixar, probably the most inventive of the Computer Generated Imagery shop -- and the film's great fun, if well under the level of the first \"Toy Story\".\" Jessica Reaves of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"While it's a technically perfect movie, its tone is too manic, its characters too jaded and, in the end, its story too empty to stand up to expectations.\" James Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"While \"Cars\" may cross the finish line ahead of any of 2006's other animated films, it's several laps behind its Pixar siblings.\"\n\nJoe Williams of the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" gave the film an A-, saying \"It's powered by a human heart through a roadway of natural wonders and cultural signposts en route to the checkered flag.\" Lisa Kennedy of \"The Denver Post\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"\"Cars\" idles at times. And it's not until its final laps that the movie gains the emotional traction we've come to expect from the \"Toy Story\" and Nemo crews.\" Tom Long of \"The Detroit News\" gave the film a B+, saying \"It's touching, it's funny, it offers cautions about the modern pace of life, and it depends on a sense of rural Americana for its soul.\" Rick Groen of \"The Globe and Mail\" gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \"For parents out there whose future holds the certain prospect of the DVD version blaring repeatedly from family-room screens, let this be your advisory. Warning: \"Cars\" comes unequipped with two essential options -- charm and a good muffler.\" Amy Biancolli of the \"Houston Chronicle\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"It thunders ahead with breezy abandon, scoring big grins on its way.\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the \"New York Daily News\" gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"It achieves the near impossible, turning cars, trucks, tractors, and farm harvesters into cute Disney characters whose fates you'll care about.\" Lou Lumenick of the \"New York Post\" gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"\"Cars\" somewhat self-indulgently runs nearly two hours -- but overall, it's well worth the trip.\" Lisa Rose of the \"Newark Star-Ledger\" gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"It's another innovative piece of entertainment from the animation studio, taking the audience on a kinetic trip into a world populated only by automobiles.\"\n\nClaudia Puig of \"USA Today\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"The animation is stunningly rendered. But the story is always the critical element in Pixar movies, and Cars' story is heartfelt with a clear and unabashed moral.\" David Edelstein of \"New York Magazine\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"Like the \"Toy Story\" films, \"Cars\" is a state-of-the-computer-art plea on behalf of outmoded, wholesome fifties technology, with a dash of Zen by way of George Lucas.\" Roger Moore of the \"Orlando Sentinel\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"It's beautiful to look at. The talking cars feel more alive than talking cars should.\" Peter Howell of the \"Toronto Star\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"\"Cars\" made me want to hop in my jalopy and to head out to Route 66, bypassing the boring interstate highways that made the Mother Road redundant.\" Moira MacDonald of \"The Seattle Times\" gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter, small-town life may well be lost on this movie's young audience -- \"Cars\" finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove.\" Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" gave the film two out of five stars, saying \"\"Cars\" might get us into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn't get us into car world as a state of mind. Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it.\" Derek Adams of \"Time Out\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"There are many other brilliant scenes, some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film's struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still, it's a Pixar film, right? And they're always worth a gander no matter what anyone says.\"\n\nIn its opening weekend, \"Cars\" earned $60,119,509 in 3,985 theaters in the United States, ranking number one at the box office. In the United States, the film held onto the number one spot for two weeks before being surpassed by \"Click\" and then by \"Superman Returns\" the following weekend. It went on to gross $462,216,280 worldwide (ranking number six in 2006 films) and $244,082,982 in the United States (the third highest-grossing film of 2006 in the country, behind \"\" and \"Night at the Museum\"). It was the second highest-grossing film released by Walt Disney Pictures, behind \"Dead Man's Chest\" and was the second highest-grossing animated film of 2006 in the United States.\n\n\"Cars\" had a highly successful run during the 2006 awards season. Many film critic associations such as the Broadcast Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review named it the best Animated Feature Film of 2006. \"Cars\" also received the title of Best Reviewed Animated Feature of 2006 from Rotten Tomatoes. Randy Newman and James Taylor received a Grammy Award for the song \"Our Town,\" which later went on to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song (an award it lost to \"I Need to Wake Up\" from \"An Inconvenient Truth\"). The film also earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, but it lost to \"Happy Feet\". \"Cars\" was also selected as the Favorite Family Movie at the 33rd People's Choice Awards. The most prestigious award that \"Cars\" received was the inaugural Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. \"Cars\" also won the highest award for animation in 2006, the Best Animated Feature Annie Award. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Animation Films list.\n\nMarcus Aurelius Canônico of \"Folha de S.Paulo\" described \"The Little Cars\" series (\"Os Carrinhos\" in Portuguese), a Brazilian computer graphics film series, as a derivative of \"Cars\". Canônico discussed whether lawsuits from Pixar would appear. The Brazilian Ministry of Culture posted Marcus Aurelius Canônico's article on its website.\n\nIt has also been noted that the plot of \"Cars\" bears a striking resemblance to that of \"Doc Hollywood\", the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor, who, after causing a traffic accident in a small town, is sentenced to work at the town hospital, falls in love with a local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have gone so far as to say that the makers of \"Cars\" plagiarized the script of \"Doc Hollywood\".\n\n\nA sequel to the film, titled \"Cars 2\", was released on June 24, 2011. It was directed again by John Lasseter, who was inspired for the film while traveling around the world promoting the first film. In the sequel, Lightning McQueen and Mater head to Japan and Europe to compete in the World Grand Prix, but Mater becomes sidetracked with international espionage. The film failed to meet or exceed the critical success of its predecessor, but was still a box office success.\n\nA second sequel, titled \"Cars 3\", was released on June 16, 2017. Lasseter didn't return to direct so Brian Fee took over the director's chair (though Lasseter was still involved as executive producer). The film focuses on Lightning McQueen, now a veteran racer, who gets a help from a young race car, Cruz Ramirez, to instruct him for the increasingly high-tech world.\n\n\n"}

In the first year that Chandler bats were available on the public market, they sold 11,000 bats out of a warehouse. Chandler has increased production every year since their opening. In 2013, the company received a $500,000 investment from Benjamin Franklin Technology Partners of Southeastern Pennsylvania for expansion. A large portion of these funds was put towards purchasing more raw materials, maple and ash wood, in an effort to further increase production of bats.

{"id": "752260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=752260", "title": "Ford Field", "text": "Ford Field\n\nFord Field is a multi-purpose domed stadium located in Downtown Detroit. It primarily serves as the home of the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL), as well as the annual Quick Lane Bowl college football bowl game, state championship football games for the MHSAA, and, as of 2018, the MHSAA State Wrestling Championships. The regular seating capacity is approximately 65,000, though it is expandable up to 70,000 for football and 80,000 for basketball. The naming rights were purchased by the Ford Motor Company at $40 million over 20 years; the Ford family holds a controlling interest in the company, and a member of the Ford family has controlled ownership of the Lions franchise since 1963.\n\nIn 1975, the Lions moved to the Pontiac Silverdome after playing at Tiger Stadium from 1938–1939, 1941–1974. By the mid 1990s, they began exploring the possibility of returning to the city of Detroit in order to build a new stadium. On August 20, 1996, the Lions announced their intention to build a new stadium in Downtown Detroit. On November 5, 1996, voters approved a referendum for the stadium.\n\nGroundbreaking for the stadium began on November 16, 1999. It was part of a downtown revitalization plan for the city of Detroit, which included Comerica Park.\n\nThe stadium's design incorporates a former Hudson's warehouse, which was constructed in the 1920s.\n\nThe presence of the warehouse allows for a seating arrangement that's unique among professional American football stadiums. The majority of suites are located in the warehouse along the stadium's southern sideline, as are the lounges that serve the premium club seats on that side of the field. The bulk of the grandstand seats are located along the northern sideline and both end-lines, with gaps in the stadium's upper half at the southwest and southeast corners. The upper deck on the stadium's northern sideline also contains one level of suites and a smaller section of club seating. A similar design was implemented at the renovated Soldier Field, albeit with the use of a new structure (as opposed to an existing building) to house four levels of suites.\n\nUnlike most domed stadiums, Ford Field allows a large amount of natural light to reach the field, thanks to immense skylights and large glass windows at the open corners. The windows along the ceiling are frosted to mimic the automotive factories that are prevalent in Metro Detroit. The south entrance provides the seating bowl and concourse with sunlight year-round and also offers fans a view of downtown Detroit. To prevent the stadium from becoming an overly imposing presence in the Detroit skyline, the playing field is 45 feet below street level, similar to the design at adjacent Comerica Park.\n\nFord Field is one of the few venues in the NFL that has end zones in the east and the west. There is no NFL rule for field construction regarding sunlight distracting players on the field. The east–west end zone design accommodated the Hudson warehouse location. The natural light is not a distraction to the players in a day game, because the light only reaches as far as the sidelines, leaving the field still properly lit with the combination of artificial stadium lighting and sunlight.\n\nIn 2017, Ford Field underwent its first major renovation. The $100 million renovation included new video boards, a new sound system, updated suites, and the renovation of multiple restaurants, clubs, and bars on the property.\n\nFord Field hosted Super Bowl XL on February 5, 2006, as the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Seattle Seahawks, 21–10 to win their fifth Super Bowl championship in front of 68,206 in attendance. It also marked the final game in the 13-year career for Steelers running back, and Detroit native, Jerome Bettis.\n\nThe stadium was home to the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl sponsored by Detroit-based Little Caesars (previously known as the Motor City Bowl and jointly sponsored by the Big Three automakers headquartered in Detroit – Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) from 2002 until 2013. It featured a top Mid-American Conference team and a Big Ten Conference team. The Little Caesars Pizza Bowl was replaced by the Quick Lane Bowl, featuring teams from the Big Ten Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference, and backed by the Lions and Ford. It has also hosted the annual MAC Football Championship Game since 2004.\n\nFord Field has been the site of several neutral site regular season college football games, including Western Michigan vs. Illinois in 2008 and Michigan State vs. Florida Atlantic in 2010.\n\nOn December 13, 2010, the Minnesota Vikings played a home game at Ford Field against the New York Giants after the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome's inflatable roof collapsed due to a rip in the roofing material caused by heavy snow accumulation. The roof failure forced the already postponed game to be moved elsewhere, and after deliberations, the NFL chose Ford Field. It was the first ever regular season Monday night game played at Ford Field. The Lions hosted their first ever \"Monday Night Football\" game in Ford Field on October 10, 2011 against the Chicago Bears.\n\nA Buffalo Bills home game against the New York Jets was played at Ford Field on November 24, 2014 after a major lake effect snowstorm hit western New York, causing the game to be moved from Ralph Wilson Stadium. The Bills won the game 38–3.\n\nOn December 13, 2003, Ford Field hosted the then largest crowd ever to attend a basketball game, as 78,129 people packed the stadium for the Basketbowl, where the Kentucky Wildcats defeated the Michigan State Spartans, 79–74.\n\nThe University of Detroit Mercy and Ford Field hosted the 2008 NCAA Basketball Tournament regional semifinal and final games (March 28 and 30). Ford Field was the site of the 2009 Final Four (April 4 and 6). For the 2008 NCAA Basketball Tournament, the court was placed in the center of the football field rather than in an end of the stadium. This was the first time this configuration was used for NCAA Tournament play with the new 70,000-seat capacity rule in effect.\n\nThe 2010 Frozen Four was held on April 8 and 10 with Boston College defeating Wisconsin to win the championship. This has been the only time NCAA hockey has used a football stadium for the championship and resulted in the largest attendance (37,592) at a Frozen Four event.\n\nFord Field has hosted the MHSAA football state championships since 2005. It also hosted the MHSAA individual wrestling state finals in 2018.\n\nThe stadium has been used to host the MCBA finals, where Michigan high school marching bands compete to be the best in the state.\n\nFord Field hosted two group stage matches of the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer tournament on June 7, 2011. Panama played Guadeloupe in the first match, while the United States played Canada in the second match.\n\nThe Professional Bull Riders brought their Built Ford Tough Series tour to Ford Field for the first time ever on March 10, 2012. Ford Field is the second Detroit area venue the BFTS has visited; they had visited The Palace of Auburn Hills in 2001, 2006 and 2007.\n\nThe United States Hot Rod Association (USHRA) holds multiple Monster Jam Monster Truck races at Ford Field. These races were previously held in the Pontiac Silverdome until it was closed. AMA Supercross Championship, also a Feld Entertainment competition, has competed at Ford Field from 2006 to 2008 and 2014 to 2017. The USHRA usually runs 2-3 events a year at Ford Field.\n\nOn April 1, 2007, Ford Field hosted World Wrestling Entertainment's WrestleMania 23. This event set a Ford Field attendance record of 80,103. It was the first WrestleMania held in the Detroit area since 93,173 fans set a world indoor attendance record at the Pontiac Silverdome for WrestleMania III in 1987.\n\nFord Field hosted the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) Midwest Regional in 2007 and 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Ford Field housed the large group gatherings of the ELCA Youth Gathering.\n\nOn November 18, 2017, Ford Field hosted the Beatification Mass of Fr. Solanus Casey, a Capuchin Franciscan Friar who ministered at the nearby St. Bonaventure Monastery on Mt. Elliott. The near-capacity crowd was one of the largest Catholic masses in Detroit history.\n\nFord Field will host the FIRST Robotics Competition Championship from 2018 to 2020 along with the nearby Cobo Center.\n"}

{"id": "8114777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8114777", "title": "Muscle hypertrophy", "text": "Muscle hypertrophy\n\nMuscle hypertrophy involves an increase in size of skeletal muscle through a growth in size of its component cells. Two factors contribute to hypertrophy: sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, which focuses more on increased muscle glycogen storage; and myofibrillar hypertrophy, which focuses more on increased myofibril size.\n\nA range of stimuli can increase the volume of muscle cells. These changes occur as an adaptive response that serves to increase the ability to generate force or resist fatigue in anaerobic conditions.\n\nStrength training, or resistance exercise, brings about neural and muscular adaptations which increase the capacity of an athlete to exert force through voluntary muscular contraction. After an initial period, in which neuro-muscular adaptation dominates, a process of muscular hypertrophy is observed whereby the size of muscle tissue increases. This increase in size is due to growth from adding sarcomeres (contractile elements) as well as an increase in non-contractile elements like sarcoplasmic fluid. The precise mechanisms which induce muscular hypertrophy are not clearly understood, with currently accepted hypotheses regarding some combination of mechanical tension, metabolic fatigue, and muscular damage as relevant factors. Progressive overload, a strategy of progressively increasing resistance or repetitions over successive bouts of exercise in order to maintain a high level of effort, is one fundamental principle of training strongly associated with muscular hypertrophy. Across the research literature, a wide variety of resistance exercise training modalities have all been shown to elicit similar hypertrophic responses in muscle tissue. Muscular hypertrophy plays an important role in competitive bodybuilding as well as strength sports like powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting.\n\nThe best approach to specifically achieve muscle growth remains controversial (as opposed to focusing on gaining strength, power, or endurance); it was generally considered that consistent anaerobic strength training will produce hypertrophy over the long term, in addition to its effects on muscular strength and endurance. Muscular hypertrophy can be increased through strength training and other short-duration, high-intensity anaerobic exercises. Lower-intensity, longer-duration aerobic exercise generally does not result in very effective tissue hypertrophy; instead, endurance athletes enhance storage of fats and carbohydrates within the muscles, as well as neovascularization.\n\nDuring a workout, increased blood flow to metabolically active areas causes muscles to temporarily increase in size, also known as being \"pumped up\" or getting \"a pump\". About two hours after a workout and typically for seven to eleven days, muscles swell due to an inflammation response as tissue damage is repaired. Longer-term hypertrophy occurs due to more permanent changes in muscle structure.\n\nBiological factors (such as genetics and sex), nutrition, and training variables can affect muscle hypertrophy.\n\nIndividual differences in genetics account for a substantial portion of the variance in existing muscle mass. A classical twin study design (similar to those of behavioral genetics) estimates that about 52% of the variance in lean body mass is estimated to be heritable and that about 45% of the variance in muscle fiber proportion is genetic as well. \nDuring puberty in males, hypertrophy occurs at an increased rate. Natural hypertrophy normally stops at full growth in the late teens. As testosterone is one of the body's major growth hormones, on average, males find hypertrophy much easier (on an absolute scale) to achieve than females and on average, have about 60% more muscle mass than women. Taking additional testosterone, as in anabolic steroids, will increase results. It is also considered a performance-enhancing drug, the use of which can cause competitors to be suspended or banned from competitions. Testosterone is also a medically regulated substance in most countries, making it illegal to possess without a medical prescription. Anabolic steroid use can cause testicular atrophy, cardiac arrest, and gynecomastia.\n\nA positive energy balance, when more calories are consumed rather than burned, is required for anabolism and therefore muscle hypertrophy. An increased requirement for protein, especially branch chained amino acids, is required for elevated protein synthesis that is seen in athletes training for muscle hypertrophy.\n\nTraining variables, in the context of strength training, such as frequency, intensity, and total volume also directly affect the increase of muscle hypertrophy. A gradual increase in all of these training variables will yield the muscular hypertrophy.\n\nThe message filters down to alter the pattern of gene expression. The additional contractile proteins appear to be incorporated into existing myofibrils (the chains of sarcomeres within a muscle cell). There appears to be some limit to how large a myofibril can become: at some point, they split. These events appear to occur within each muscle fiber. That is, hypertrophy results primarily from the growth of each muscle cell, rather than an increase in the number of cells. Skeletal muscle cells are however unique in the body in that they can contain multiple nuclei, and the number of nuclei can increase.\n\nCortisol decreases amino acid uptake by muscle tissue, and inhibits protein synthesis. The short-term increase in protein synthesis that occurs subsequent to resistance training returns to normal after approximately 28 hours in adequately fed male youths. Another study determined that muscle protein synthesis was elevated even 72 hours following training.\n\nA small study performed on young and elderly found that ingestion of 340 grams of lean beef (90 g protein) did not increase muscle protein synthesis any more than ingestion of 113 grams of lean beef (30 g protein). In both groups, muscle protein synthesis increased by 50%. The study concluded that more than 30 g protein in a single meal did not further enhance the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis in young and elderly. However, this study didn't check protein synthesis in relation to training; therefore conclusions from this research are controversial.\n\nIt is not uncommon for bodybuilders to advise a protein intake as high as 2–4 g per kilogram of bodyweight per day. However, scientific literature has suggested this is higher than necessary, as protein intakes greater than 1.8 g per kilogram of body weight showed to have no greater effect on muscle hypertrophy. A study carried out by American College of Sports Medicine (2002) put the recommended daily protein intake for athletes at 1.2–1.8 g per kilogram of body weight. Conversely, Di Pasquale (2008), citing recent studies, recommends a minimum protein intake of 2.2 g/kg \"for anyone involved in competitive or intense recreational sports who wants to maximize lean body mass but does not wish to gain weight. However athletes involved in strength events (..) may need even more to maximize body composition and athletic performance. In those attempting to minimize body fat and thus maximize body composition, for example in sports with weight classes and in bodybuilding, it's possible that protein may well make up over 50% of their daily caloric intake.\"\n\nMicrotrauma, which is tiny damage to the fibers, may play a significant role in muscle growth. When microtrauma occurs (from weight training or other strenuous activities), the body responds by overcompensating, replacing the damaged tissue and adding more, so that the risk of repeat damage is reduced. Damage to these fibers has been theorized as the possible cause for the symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and is why progressive overload is essential to continued improvement, as the body adapts and becomes more resistant to stress. However, work examining the time course of changes in muscle protein synthesis and their relationship to hypertrophy showed that damage was unrelated to hypertrophy. In fact, in that study the authors showed that it was not until the damage subsided that protein synthesis was directed to muscle growth.\n\nIn the bodybuilding and fitness community and even in some academic books skeletal muscle hypertrophy is described as being in one of two types: Sarcoplasmic or myofibrillar. According to this hypothesis, during sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, the volume of sarcoplasmic fluid in the muscle cell increases with no accompanying increase in muscular strength, whereas during myofibrillar hypertrophy, actin and myosin contractile proteins increase in number and add to muscular strength as well as a small increase in the size of the muscle. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is greater in the muscles of bodybuilders because studies suggest sarcoplasmic hypertrophy shows a greater increase in muscle size while myofibrillar hypertrophy proves to increase overall muscular strength making it more dominant in Olympic weightlifters. These two forms of adaptations rarely occur completely independently of one another; one can experience a large increase in fluid with a slight increase in proteins, a large increase in proteins with a small increase in fluid, or a relatively balanced combination of the two.\n\nExamples of increased muscle hypertrophy are seen in various professional sports, mainly strength related sports such as boxing, olympic weightlifting, mixed martial arts, rugby, professional wrestling and various forms of gymnastics. Athletes in other more skill-based sports such as basketball, baseball, ice hockey, and soccer may also train for increased muscle hypertrophy to better suit their position of play. For example, a center (basketball) may want to be bigger and more muscular to better overpower his or her opponents in the low post. Athletes training for these sports train extensively not only in strength but also in cardiovascular and muscular endurance training.\n\n"}

{"id": "10753876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10753876", "title": "National Stadium, Warsaw", "text": "National Stadium, Warsaw\n\nThe PGE Narodowy (official name since 2015) or National Stadium ( ) is a retractable roof football stadium located in Warsaw, Poland. It is used mostly for football matches and it is the home stadium of Poland national football team.\n\nThe stadium has a seating capacity of 58,145 which makes it the largest association football arena in Poland. Its construction started in 2008 and finished in November 2011. It is located on the site of the former 10th-Anniversary Stadium, on Aleja Zieleniecka in Praga Południe district, near the city center. The stadium has a retractable PVC roof which unfolds from a nest on a spire suspended above the centre of the pitch. The retractable roof is inspired by the cable-supported unfolding system of Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt, Germany, and is similar to the newly renovated roof of BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The stadium is also very similar to the Arena Națională in Bucharest in terms of age, capacity and the roof.\n\nThe National Stadium hosted the opening match (a group match), the 2 group matches, a quarterfinal, and the semifinal of the UEFA Euro 2012, co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.\n\nThe stadium is equipped with a heated pitch, training pitch, façade lighting, and underground parking. It is a multipurpose venue able to host sporting events, concerts, cultural events, and conferences. The official stadium opening took place on 19 January 2012, and the first football match was played on 29 February 2012. The match between the Polish national football team and the Portuguese team ended with a 0–0 draw.\n\nThe stadium hosted the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League final.\n\nThe general contractor of the National Stadium was a German-Austrian-Polish consortium led by Alpine Bau and made up of Alpine Bau Deutschland, Alpine Construction Poland, PBG SA and Hydrobudowa Poland SA. The completion date was set for 24 months from the signing of the contract and the construction process involved approximately 1,200 employees.\n\nThe stadium has a capacity of 58,145 seats for spectators during football matches and up to 72,900 during concerts and other events (including 106 sites for disabled people). The total volume of the stadium (without the roof) is more than 1,000,000 m² and the total area is 204,000 m². The retractable roof structure is 240 × 270 m and the central spire stands at a height of 124 metres above the River Vistula and 100 m above the pitch. The total length of the lower promenade is 924 meters. The stadium has the largest conference center in Warsaw with a capacity of 1600 people including 25,000 m² of commercial office space. Underground parking for 1765 cars is located beneath the pitch. The stadium contains restaurants, a fitness club, a pub, and 69 luxury skyboxes.\n\nThe National Stadium is a multi-sports facility that allows for the organization of sporting events, concerts and cultural events. In addition, it will also serve as an office, market place, hotel, gastronomic point and have other uses. As a result, it is expected that about 2000 to 3000 people will visit the stadium every single day.\n\nThe stadium's façade refers to the Polish national colors, resembling a waving Flag of Poland and it consists of silver and red colors. The same palette was used to color the stadium's seating. The facade which consists of painted mesh that was imported from Spain, covers the inner aluminum and glass elevation. The stadium is an open structure, which means the lack of a closed facade, so the temperature inside is similar to the environmental temperature, despite the closed roof construction. Such a construction allows for natural ventilation of rooms placed under the stands and access to natural light.\n\nElevations are stretched on a powerful construction of the pipes that were manufactured in Italy. This structure is completely independent from the concrete stand construction and it is fundamental to the retractable stadium’s roof. Thanks to this, designers could freely design the space under the stands.\n\nThe stadium is equipped with a heated pitch. The pitch is installed with a lawn of Dutch grass, cultivated in Heythuysen, the Netherlands. During the organization of events such as concerts, the pitch will be covered with special panel, which must be removed within 5 days of its installation. A second option: to install a grass field on a special floating platform, was discarded due to it being too expensive.\n\nThe National Stadium was designed by the German-Polish consortium gmp Architects von Gerkan, Marg and Partners, J.S.K Architekci Sp. z o.o. and sbp—schlaich bergermann und partner (the design by Volkwin Marg and Hubert Nienhoff with Markus Pfisterer, Zbigniew Pszczulny, Mariusz Rutz, Marcin Chruslinski).\n\nThe structure is composed of two-level stands—top and bottom—with a capacity for 58,145 spectators. All seating in the National Stadium was provided by Polish company Forum Seating (part of the Nowy Styl Group located in Krosno). There are 900 seats for media and press, more than 4,600 so-called \"premium seats\", designed for special guests, 106 seats for disabled people and more than 800 seats in the VIP lodges.\nUnder the stands, there are changing rooms, conference halls and living areas with a total area of 130 000 m². The building has eight stories with varied heights. The highest point at the stands, is located 41 meters above the former 10th-Anniversary Stadium pitch, while the highest point of the steel roof structure is 70 meters above that level. The roof can cover not only the stands, but also the pitch.\n\nPartially transparent, the retractable roof was made of fibreglass covered with teflon. This kind of material is resistant to weather factors (rain, the heat of the sun, and can hold up to 18 cm of wet snow) and the crease tendency. The production technology comes from German company Hightex GmbH, and the textile was produced in Bangkok by the Asia Membrane Co. Ltd.\n\nThe process of opening or closing the roof takes about 20 minutes and it can only be performed at temperatures above 5 °C and not during rain (this was the reason for a one-day postponement of the football match against England on 16 October 2012). A drive system is used for stretching the membrane during the process of opening and for folding the material during the process of closing the roof. The total weight of the steel-cables supporting the roof structure is 1,200 tons. Under the roof there are four LED display screens, each with an area of 200 m².\n\nOn , the consortium of JSK Architects Ltd., GMP—von Gerkan, Marg und Partner Architekten and SBP—Schleich Bergermann und Partner presented a conceptual design (visualization and scale model) of a new stadium.\n\nThe first pre-construction work began on when 126 concrete piles were driven into the soil of the basin of the old stadium's grandstand. On , the National Sports Centre Ltd submitted documents required to obtain a construction permit from the governor of Masovia. This was approved on , and on , an agreement with Pol-Aqua SA to implement the first stage of construction work was signed. A few days later, on , the construction of the stadium began.\n\nOn the construction site, close to the National Sports Centre, an outdoor webcam was installed. Broadcasting started on and people could track the progress of construction. Since the start of the second stage of construction on , the entire process was also viewable from a second camera installed on a tower at Washington Roundabout. Images from the cameras are still available on the official websites of the stadium.\n\nThe first stage of construction included the demolition of concrete structures of the 10th-Anniversary Stadium, preparation of the ground, driving about 7000 concrete piles into the soil, construction of 6700 gravel and concrete columns, and the building of approximately 900 construction piles that now form the foundation of the stadium.\n\nOn 9 March 2009 the pile driving process was completed, and exactly one month later, opening of the offers from companies wishing to implement the second stage of the stadium construction took place. The best offer was introduced by German-Austrian-Polish consortium of companies - Alpine Bau Deutschland AG, Alpine Bau GmbH and Alpine Construction Poland Ltd., Hydrobudowa Poland SA and PBG SA and it was worth 1 252 755 008.64 zł.\n\nAt the end of September, the first construction elements were visible from outside the stadium. The cornerstone (foundation stone) and a time capsule were set during the ceremony held on 7 October 2009. The time capsule contained flags of Poland, the European Union and the city of Warsaw, newspapers of the day, coins, banknotes, and other artifacts.\n\nAt the end of January the first element of the roof structure arrived at the construction site.\nThis element was 1 of 72 that became part of the massive steel roof structure. Each of them weighs about 48 tons and is 12.5 meters tall. The completion of installation of all prefabricated elements took place by 13 August 2010, which represented the entire structure of the stadium stands. Ten days later all concrete works were finished.\n\nOn 16 December 2010 at the headquarters of the National Sports Centre a press conference took place dedicated to the so-called ‘big lift operation’ at the stadium. The conference discussed the main principles of the process, one of the most technologically\n\nadvanced operations in the world and the first such project in Europe. No major problems occurred during this operation and ‘big lift’ was finalized on January 4, 2011. On this occasion, in the presence of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Mayor of Warsaw Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, a ceremony of symbolic topping-out was held.\n\nThe National Stadium was originally planned to be completed on 30 June 2011. The stadium was scheduled to be opened to the public on July 22, 2011, while its official opening was scheduled to take place on August 27.\nDue to ongoing construction the event was moved to January 2012 and only an inaugural illumination of the facade of the stadium took place in August. A match against the Germany national football team had been scheduled on 6 September 2011 but this was relocated to Gdańsk, because the National Stadium wasn't ready yet.\n\nConstruction work was officially completed on 29 November 2011. One day later, Rafał Kapler - The NCS President submitted to the site manager an application needed to get a certificate of occupancy. The official opening ceremony of the stadium took place on 29 January 2012. The event was celebrated by concerts by Polish celebrities: Voo Voo and Haydamaky, Zakopower, Coma, T. Love, Lady Pank and ended with an evening fireworks show. On 10 February 2012, installation of heating and irrigation systems and the pitch installation was completed.\n\nThe stadium is located near the railway station Warszawa Stadion. The station has two side platforms flanking the suburban tracks of the Warsaw Cross-City Line used by the regional trains run by Koleje Mazowieckie and Szybka Kolej Miejska. The stadium can be reached by the S1 and S2 lines. The trip from central Warsaw takes about 5 minutes, and during the rush hours trains run every 4 minutes. Within an hour about 26000 people could reach stadium only by trains. In early 2012, the station has undergone thorough modernization in preparation for the new stadium and for the UEFA Euro 2012.\n\nThe stadium is accessible from the Warsaw Metro. The closest station is Stadion Narodowy metro station (C14) opened in March, 2015.\n\nAround the stadium there are several tram and bus stops. The most convenient way to reach the stadium from the city centre is to use the transport hub located on Rondo Waszyngtona.\n\nOn February 29, 2012, 100 days before the start of UEFA Euro 2012 tournament, the Polish national football team, played the inaugural match against the Portuguese team which ended with a goalless draw.\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the UEFA Euro 2012 hosted jointly by Poland and Ukraine. Three Group A matches, a quarter-final and a semi-final were played there (with the other matches in that group played at the Wrocław Stadium).\n\nThe following matches were played at the stadium during the UEFA Euro 2012:\n\nOn July 15, 2012, two weeks after the UEFA Euro 2012, the National Stadium hosted the VII SuperFinal PLFA (more commonly known as the Polish Bowl), the championship game of the Polish American Football League.\n\nThe stadium is the venue for the Science Picnic, an annual science education fair, since 2013. During the 2013 Science Picnic, the stadium was visited by 142,573 people, which was at the time record attendance at any type of event held at the stadium.\n\nOn August 30, 2014, the National Stadium hosted the opening ceremony and match (Poland vs. Serbia) of the 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship. Poland beat Serbia in front of 61,500 spectators – a new record for an FIVB volleyball match.\n\nThe stadium will also host Motorcycle speedway with the Speedway Grand Prix of Poland scheduled as Round 1 of the 2015 Speedway Grand Prix series to be held there on 18 April. Poland's popular and most recent World Champion Tomasz Gollob has been granted a Wild Card entry to the Grand Prix.\n\n\n"}

This field hosted the 1922 Grey Cup, where the Golden Gaels defeated the Edmonton Elks 13–1, for their first of three Grey Cups. The official attendance was listed at 4,700. According to Michael Januska's book, \"Grey Cup Century\" there were more spectators on hand than the original grandstand could accommodate. \"The 10th Grey Cup was the only final played in Kingston, Ontario. The stands at Richardson Stadium were filled to capacity, just under 5,000, with the overflow standing around the field.\" - \"Grey Cup Century\", pg. 46Franklin Delano Roosevelt received his honorary degree from Queen's on August 18, 1938 at Richardson, where he made a historic speech that was seen as a departure from American isolationism.\n\nWhen a new social sciences complex, Mackintosh-Corry Hall was planned, the original stadium was torn down and relocated to the newly acquired West Campus. Many staff, students, and alumni were very upset about the move, feeling that the stadium belonged in the heart of campus, but the project went ahead anyway and the stadium was built on West Campus in 1971.\n\nIn 2013, seating capacity was reduced to 8,500, down from 10,200, because of the temporary bleachers due to construction.\n\nPlans to reconstruct the 40-year-old stadium at the same location were approved in December 2014, with $20.27 million of funding needed. Principal Daniel Woolf stated that the stadium was \"desperately in need of revitalization\". $17 million was raised from donations, including $10 million from former Gaels football player and current Guelph Gryphons head coach Stu Lang. Construction began on December 5, 2015 and the stadium re-opened for the beginning of the 2016 football season on September 17, 2016.\n\nRichardson played host to two World Cup 2006 qualifiers between Canada and Belize in 2004. Canada won both matches 4–0 and progressed to the semifinal stage after Belize had forfeited their right to play a home match due to a lack of infrastructure. \n\nIt hosted the Colonial Cup match between the U.S. Tomahawks and Canada Wolverines on September 19, 2010 which was the first international rugby league match played in Canada since 1995.\n\nOn June 9, 2012, Canada played the United States in a friendly match. Canada won 28–25 in front of 7,521 spectators.\n\n"}

The inaugural president of the club was Sir William Conrad Reeves, Chief Justice of Barbados and other members consisted mostly of \"lawyers, medical practitioners, elite schoolmasters, higher level civil servants and the few non-whites to have penetrated the managerial levels of the business, commercial and plantation worlds.\" The club played its matches at the Belleville ground in Saint Michael and the first captain of the club was George Learmond.\n\nCricket in Barbados at the time was strictly divided by colour and class. Spartan was seen as a middle-class club and in its early years efforts to admit working-class cricketers met with some resistance. In 1899, the club was divided about the admission of Fitz Hinds—a talented cricketer who had previously worked as a groundsman at Pickwick Cricket Club. After his admission, many of his team-mates refused to play with him. The club was split again in 1913 when Herman Griffith attempted to join the club. Considered \"too poor to enter\", he was denied admission. This attitude distressed a significant minority of the club who split and established a club for working-class blacks, Empire Cricket Club in 1914. Spartan and Empire developed a strong rivalry.\n\nBefore and after Barbadian independence, members of Spartan Cricket Club were influential members of Barbadian society, including Grantley Adams, the first Premier of Barbados. It is claimed that Spartan has \"produced more <nowiki>[</nowiki>West Indies<nowiki>]</nowiki> Test cricketers than any other [club] in the Caribbean\". The club now plays its games at Queen's Park in Bridgetown. \n\nNotable cricketers from Spartan include:\n\n"}

{"id": "3159751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3159751", "title": "Tank McNamara", "text": "Tank McNamara\n\nTank McNamara is a daily syndicated comic strip written by Jeff Millar and illustrated by Bill Hinds. The strip debuted in 1974. Hinds took over writing after the death of Millar in late November 2012 due to bile duct cancer.\n\nThe title character is a local sports television reporter who used to be a defensive lineman in the National Football League, hence his name (whether nickname or given name is unclear). The strip focuses primarily on contemporary American athletics, which allows it to remain topical and also to dabble in related subjects such as politics and social issues.\n\nBefore becoming a multi-sport broadcaster and reporter, Tank McNamara played college football for \"Enormous State University\" (team name: the Sandcrabs), which serves the role of a generic NCAA Division I university with problem-plagued athletic programs. The local professional teams are fictional American major-league franchises (baseball's \"Bashers\"; football's \"Smashers\"; ice hockey's \"Igloos\"; basketball's \"Stuffers\"). The strip also portrays fictional sponsors, including \"Heavy Beer\", spoofing the light beer ads that are so common in American sports broadcasts. It also features caricatures of many real figures from sports. A scientist named Dr. Tszap (also spelled Tzap) develops strange products intended to help sports teams.\n\nIn earlier years, Tank was portrayed as a buffoon ex-professional athlete (an NFL defensive linebacker, jersey number 55) unqualified to do his journalistic job. Recurring gags focused on Tank's \"fumble-mouth\" mistakes (such as presenting the \"Norts Spews\"), and on his tendency to jump on anything loose on the floor as if it were a fumbled football. An annual feature was a Christmas tale of Tank's last minute quest to obtain that year's \"must have\" toy for his nephew.\n\nTanks' overprotective mother and his father Ed make occasional appearances.\n\nTank has matured with the strip, which has gone on to highlight his loyalty, inherently gentle nature, and good heart. Recent years have seen several sequences dealing with Tank's youthful indiscretions. His behavior is never as damning as he believes it to have been, and he is always deeply sorry for his actions. While these sequences flesh out the background of Tank's character, they show the reader that he has always been a decent human being.\n\nTank, who is a bachelor portrayed as being vulnerable to romantic injury, began seriously dating a woman named Angela in 2005. Angela works at his TV station, and the two met after she beat him in the station's 2005 NCAA tournament pool, despite choosing teams based on their uniform colors. Angela is the single mother of an athletically gifted son to whom Tank serves as a father figure, and she has eschewed competing in sports since a youthful tennis talent took over her life. She accompanies Tank to many work assignments, often assisting him in undercover reporting.\nIn November 2012, Tank agreed to escort a producer named Natalie to the Women in Media Ball. He explained that he and Angela were \"taking time off from each other.\" Angela also confirmed that she was seeing someone else.\n\nTank is still friends with Buck Baker, a quarterback he protected as a lineman.\nTank's neighbors Nick and Kate had their own comic strip, \"Second Chances\", from 1996 to 2000.\n\nThe strip consistently addresses contemporary social problems related to sports, including gambling addiction, steroids, the arrests of pro athletes, and athlete salaries. Sometimes these issues are portrayed fictionally, as when Tank's Little Brother battles an online gambling problem, but sometimes the strip treats specific controversies by naming names. One popular example is its Sports Jerk of the Year award, which allows readers to nominate the figure they have found most objectionable and then vote on who is the worst. Previous \"winners\" include Terrell Owens (2x), Bud Selig (2x), Daniel Snyder, John Rocker, Lleyton Hewitt, Latrell Sprewell, Ronald Curry and Roberto Alomar. Marking the strip's fortieth anniversary in 2014, readers were invited to submit nominations for the Sports Jerk of the last 40 years, which was \"won\" by Lance Armstrong, with Dennis Rodman and Pete Rose as runners-up.\n\nJeffrey Lynn Millar was born July 10, 1942 in Pasadena, Texas. He graduated from The University of Texas.\n\nJeff Millar reviewed movies for \"The Houston Chronicle\", the newspaper where he worked from 1965 until his retirement in 2000. In addition to writing \"Tank McNamara\", he wrote a humor column for the paper. His autobiographical comic strip \"Second Chances\" ran from 1996 to 2000. Other works included the novel \"Private Sector\" and three plays, including \"The Rice\".\n\nMillar died after a four-year battle with biliary cancer November 30, 2012.\n\nBill Hinds (born April 21, 1950, Houston, Texas) is a graduate of Stephen F. Austin University. Hinds illustrated \"Tank McNamara\" with co-creator and writer Jeff Millar from 1974 to 2012, when he also took over writing due to Millar's failing health.\n\nIn addition to \"Tank McNamara\", Bill created, writes and draws the feature \"Buzz Beamer\" in the monthly \"Sports Illustrated Kids\". His \"Buzz\" work can be found online at sikids.com Buzz animation\n\nBill created a parent/kids/sports strip, \"Cleats\", which ran from 2001 to 2010. \"Cleats\" reruns can be found on GoComics.com.\n\nHe also illustrated the feature \"According to Guinness\" for ten years, and created two experimental short-lived comic strips \"Clown Alley\" and \"Longshots\" for the Philadelphia Inquirer Sunday page.\n\nHinds collaborated with writing partner Millar on the \"Second Chances\" strip.\n\nBill Hinds received the National Cartoonist Society divisional award for Sports Cartoons in 1986 and their New Media Award in 2000. He received an additional nomination for the New Media Award in 2002.\n\nHinds has held seats on the board of the National Cartoonists Society and the Newspaper Features Council.\n\nHe lives with his wife, Lisa, in Spring, Texas. They have three children.\n\n\n\n\n"}
