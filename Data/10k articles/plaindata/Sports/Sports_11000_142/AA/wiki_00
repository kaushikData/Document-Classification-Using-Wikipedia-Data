The centre is owned by South Bank Corporation and managed by AEG Ogden.\n\nDesigned by COX Architecture, the BCEC was constructed by Leighton Contractors, beginning in March 1993 with the demolition of World Expo Park. The building cost $170 million and was mostly funded by the Queensland Government's sale of a casino license, with the remainder funded directly by the government. The centre was completed in May 1995, and opened on 6 June.\n\nThe design of an expansion to BCEC on Grey Street was approved in 2007. Laing O'Rourke was appointed as the project's builder in June 2009 after a delay caused by budget issues, and construction began in 2010. The project was completed in early 2012, and opened on 25 January. It cost $140 million and was funded by the Queensland Government. The five-level expansion has 25,000m² of floorspace and includes two auditoria for 400 and 600 with accompanying foyer space, speakers’ facilities, and private boardrooms.\n\nThe building is 450 metres in length, 120 m wide and 24 m high. The complex roof design is based on five hyperbolic paraboloids. The building is stabilised by concrete shear walls and clad in steel. A car park is located on the ground floor.\n\nBCEC hosts events such as the Brisbane International Boat Show, Home Show, Brides Wedding & Honeymoon Expo, World Travel Expo, graduation ceremonies for Griffith University and Southbank Institute of Technology, art shows, charity events. \n\nThe Centre was selected as the hosting venue for the 2014 G-20 Australia summit.\n\nFrom 1998 until 2008 the BCEC Great Hall was the home of three times National Basketball League (NBL) champions the Brisbane Bullets. The Bullets moved from the previous home, the 13,500 seat Brisbane Entertainment Centre, due in part to dwindling crowds and the cost of playing out of the Boondall based stadium. During the 2011-12 NBL season the Gold Coast Blaze played two home games at the centre.\n\nSince 2008 the Convention Centre has also been the home to the Brisbane-based Queensland Firebirds who play in netball's ANZ Championship. The Firebirds were a foundation club of the Commonwealth Bank Trophy (CBT) in 1997 and played at the 2,700 seat Chandler Arena. When the CBT was retired in 2007 and the ANZ Championship took its place the Firebirds moved to the new championship and also moved into the larger Convention Centre to be its second major tenant alongside the Bullets.

{"id": "583793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=583793", "title": "Double switch (baseball)", "text": "Double switch (baseball)\n\nIn baseball, the double switch is a type of player substitution, usually performed by a team while playing defense. The double switch is typically used to make a pitching substitution, while simultaneously placing the incoming pitcher in a more favorable spot in the batting order than was occupied by the outgoing pitcher. (On the assumption that the pitcher will be a poor hitter, the incoming pitcher will generally take the spot in the batting order of a position player who has recently batted, so as to avoid the pitcher making a plate appearance in the next couple of innings.) To perform a double switch (or any other substitution), the ball must be dead.\n\nSince the batting order can be changed only as a result of a player substitution, while the defensive arrangement may be changed freely (among players currently in the game), the double switch typically takes the following form:\n\nIn the short term, the lineup is strengthened because a poor-hitting pitcher will not make a plate appearance soon. The disadvantage is that a position player must be removed from play and replaced by another, often inferior, position player. The advantage of the double switch over pinch hitting is that it uses up fewer players. If a relief pitcher is brought in before the at-bat, then the manager can substitute a pinch-hitter for him. However, this would require a new pitcher for the next half-inning. By using a double switch, an incoming pitcher can be left in the game for a substantial period before his turn in the batting lineup arrives, no matter what the previous batting order was.\n\nWhile the double switch plays an important role in the National League, the designated hitter (DH) rule has effectively eliminated the advantages of the double switch in the games using American League rules—so the double switch is rarely used in AL games. The designated hitter's role is to bat in the pitcher's spot in the lineup. Major League rules do not allow a multiple substitution involving a DH to alter the lineup position of the DH. Although uncommon, it is possible to forgo the DH privilege (e.g. if the DH becomes a position player, usually due to injury to another player), and then utilize the double switch later with that player. It can also be used by an AL team playing on the road during interleague play or the World Series, because MLB rules call for the rules of the home team to be used when teams from different leagues meet (so there is no DH when the NL team is the home team).\n\nWhen the team is up to bat, a manager can get the same effect as a double switch by leaving in the player who has pinch-hit for the pitcher and replacing another player in the lineup who has made the last out of the inning with a new pitcher. This will take the following form:\nA double switch has infrequently resulted in a team batting out of turn because the lineup card was not updated to reflect the change, either because the umpires were not informed of the change, or because the change was not recorded. In addition, because double-switches are typically communicated verbally, it creates opportunities for confusion and miscommunication that can be costly to the switching team. \n"}

{"id": "5348091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5348091", "title": "Goalkeeper (association football)", "text": "Goalkeeper (association football)\n\nThe goalkeeper, often shortened to keeper or goalie, is one of the major positions of association football. It is the most specialised position in the sport. The goalkeeper's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring (moving the ball over the defended goal-line within the frame of the goal). This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line. Within the penalty area goalkeepers are able to use their hands, making them (outside throw-ins) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball. The special status of goalkeepers is indicated by them wearing different coloured kits from their teammates.\n\nThe back pass rule prevents goalkeepers handling direct passes back to them from teammates. Goalkeepers usually perform goal kicks, and also give commands to their defense during corner kicks, direct and indirect free kicks, and marking. Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch, giving them a unique perspective on play development.\n\nThe goalkeeper is the only required position of a team. If they are injured or sent off, a substitute goalkeeper has to take their place, otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper's place in goal. In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off, a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper (thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players). They then play the remainder of the match with nine outfield players. If a team does not have a substitute goalkeeper, or they have already used all of their permitted substitutions for the match, an outfield player has to take the dismissed goalkeeper's place and wear the goalkeeper shirt.\n\nThe squad number for a first choice goalkeeper is generally number 1.\n\nAssociation football, like many sports, has experienced many changes in tactics resulting in the generation and elimination of different positions. Goalkeeper is the only position that is certain to have existed since the codification of the sport. Even in the early days of organised football, when systems were limited or non-existent and the main idea was for all players to attack and defend, teams had a designated member to play as the goalkeeper.\n\nThe earliest account of football teams with player positions comes from Richard Mulcaster in 1581 and does not specify goalkeepers. The earliest specific reference to keeping goal comes from Cornish Hurling in 1602. According to Carew: \"they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foot asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelve score off, other twayne in like distance, which they term their Goals. One of these is appointed by lots, to the one side, and the other to his adverse party. There is assigned for their guard, a couple of their best stopping Hurlers\". Other references to scoring goals begin in English literature in the early 16th century; for example, in John Day's play \"The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green\" (performed circa 1600; published 1659): \"I'll play a gole at camp-ball\" (an extremely violent variety of football, popular in East Anglia). Similarly, in a 1613 poem, Michael Drayton refers to \"when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe\". It seems inevitable that wherever a game has evolved goals, some form of goalkeeping must also be developed. David Wedderburn refers to what has been translated from Latin as to \"keep goal\" in 1633, though this does not necessarily imply a fixed goalkeeper position.\n\nThe word \"goal-keeper\" is used in the novel \"Tom Brown's School Days\" (published in 1857, but set in the 1830s). The author is here referring to an early form of rugby football: \n\nThe word \"goal-keeper\" appeared in the Sheffield Rules of 1867, but the term did not refer to a designated player, but rather to \"that player on the defending side who for the time being is nearest to his own goal\". The goal-keeper, thus defined, did not enjoy any special handling privileges.\n\nThe FA's first Laws of the Game of 1863 did not make any special provision for a goalkeeper, with any player being allowed to catch or knock-on the ball. Handling the ball was completely forbidden (for all players) in 1870. The next year, 1871, the laws were amended to introduce the goalkeeper and specify that the keeper was allowed to handle the ball \"for the protection of his goal\". The restrictions on the ability of the goalkeeper to handle the ball were changed several times in subsequent revisions of the laws:\n\n\nInitially, goalkeepers typically played between the goalposts and had limited mobility, except when trying to save opposition shots. Throughout the years, the role of the goalkeeper has evolved, due to the changes in systems of play, to become more active. The goalkeeper is the only player in association football allowed to use their hands to control the ball (other than during throw-ins).\n\nDue to several time-wasting techniques which were used by goalkeepers, such as bouncing the ball on the ground or throwing it in the air and then catching it again, in the 1960s, the Laws of the game were revised further, and the goalkeeper was given a maximum of four steps to travel while holding, bouncing or throwing the ball in the air and catching it again, without having to release it into play. The FIFA Board later also devised an anti-parrying rule, saying that such deliberate parrying for the purpose of evading the Law was to be regarded also as holding the ball.\n\nIn 1992, the International Football Association Board made changes in the laws of the game that affected goalkeepers – notably the back-pass rule, which prohibits goalkeepers from handling the ball when receiving a deliberate pass from a teammate that is made with their feet. This rule change was made to discourage time-wasting and overly defensive play after the 1990 FIFA World Cup which was described as exceedingly dull, rife with back-passing and goalkeepers holding the ball. Also, goalkeepers would frequently drop the ball and dribble it around, only to pick it up again once opponents came closer to put them under pressure, a typical time-wasting technique. Therefore, another rule was introduced at the same time as the back-pass rule. This rule prohibits the goalkeeper from handling the ball again once he or she has released it for play; an offence results in an indirect free kick to the opposition. Furthermore any player negating the spirit of the new rule would be likely to be cautioned for unsporting behaviour and punished by an indirect free-kick.\n\nOn 1 July 1997, FIFA decided to extend the back-pass rule by applying it also to throw-ins from defenders to their own goalkeeper; in order to prevent further time-wasting, FIFA also established that if a goalkeeper holds the ball for more than five or six seconds the referee must adjudge this as time-wasting and award an indirect free-kick to the opposing team.\n\nThe position of goalkeeper is the only position in the game which is technically distinct from the others in the course of normal play. The Laws of the Game distinguish the goalkeeper from the other players in several ways, most significantly exempting them from the prohibition on handling the ball, though only within their own penalty area. Once a goalkeeper has control of the ball in their hands, opponents are not permitted to challenge them. Goalkeepers have a specialised role as the sole defender in penalty kicks and penalty shoot-outs. Goalkeepers are required to wear distinct colours from other players, and are permitted to wear caps and tracksuit bottoms.\n\nThe Laws mandate that one player on the team must be designated as the goalkeeper at all times, meaning that if a goalkeeper is sent off or injured and unable to continue another player must assume the goalkeeper position. The Laws allow for teams to change the player designated as goalkeeper at stoppages in play, but in practice this is rarely exercised.\n\nThe Laws place no restrictions on a goalkeeper leaving their penalty area and acting as an ordinary player, though generally goalkeepers stay close to their goal throughout the match. \n\nGoalkeepers routinely perform extension dives. To execute this, they push off the ground with the foot nearest to the ball, launching themselves into a horizontal position. At this point, the ball may be caught or parried away from the goal. In the latter case, a good goalkeeper will attempt to ensure that the rebound cannot be taken by a player of the opposing team, although this is not always possible.\n\nThe tactical responsibilities of goalkeepers include:\n\n\nAlthough goalkeepers have special privileges, including the ability to handle the ball in the penalty area, they are otherwise subject to the same rules as any other player.\n\nGoalkeepers are not required to stay in the penalty area; they may get involved in play anywhere on the pitch, and it is common for them to act as an additional defender (or 'sweeper') during certain passages of the game. Goalkeepers with a long throwing range or accurate long-distance kicks may be able to quickly create attacking positions for a team and generate goal-scoring chances from defensive situations, a tactic known as the long ball.\n\nGyula Grosics from the Hungary \"Golden Team\" of the 1950s was thought to be the first goalkeeper to play as the 'sweeper-keeper'. Tommy Lawrence has also been credited with revolutionising the role of the goalkeeper by effectively acting as a 11th outfield player. The rushing playing style used by Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar seen during the 1980s–90s makes him one of the original sweeper-keepers of the modern era. René Higuita was another who became known for his unorthodox, skilful but sometimes reckless techniques. As of 2011, Manuel Neuer has been described as a sweeper-keeper due to his speed and unique style of play which occasionally includes him acting as a sweeper for his team by rushing off his line to anticipate opposing forwards who have beaten the offside trap. With his excellent ball control and distribution, which enables him to start plays from the back, he has said he could play in the German third division as a centre-back if he wanted to. Hugo Lloris of Tottenham Hotspur and France, and former goalkeepers Fabien Barthez and Edwin van der Sar, have also been described as sweeper-keepers, while Claudio Bravo of Manchester City has even been described as a \"playmaker\".\n\nSome goalkeepers have scored goals. Other than by accident when a long kicked clearance reaches the other end of the field and evades the opposing goalkeeper with the aid of strong winds and/or unexpected bounces, this most commonly occurs where a goalkeeper has rushed up to the opposite end of the pitch to give his team a numerical advantage in attack, leaving his own goal undefended. As such, it is normally only done late in a game at set-pieces where the consequences of scoring far outweigh those of conceding a further goal, such as for a team trailing in a knock-out tournament.\n\nSome goalkeepers, such as Higuita, Rogério Ceni, Hans-Jörg Butt and José Luis Chilavert, are also expert set-piece takers. These players may take their team's attacking free kicks or penalties. Ceni, São Paulo's long-time custodian, has scored 100 goals in his career, more than many outfield players.\n\nGoalkeepers must wear kit that distinguishes them clearly from other players and match officials, as this is all that the FIFA Laws of the Game require. Some goalkeepers have received recognition for their match attire, like Lev Yashin of the Soviet Union, who was nicknamed the \"Black Spider\" for his distinctive all-black outfit; Klaus Lindenberger of Austria, who designed his own variation of a clown's costume; Jorge Campos of Mexico, who was popular for his colourful attire; Raul Plassman of Cruzeiro Esporte Clube and his all-yellow outfit; and Gábor Király for wearing a pair of grey tracksuit bottoms instead of shorts.\n\nAlthough it was initially more common for goalkeepers to wear long-sleeved jerseys, recently several goalkeepers, such as Gianluigi Buffon, have also been known to wear short-sleeves.\n\nMost goalkeepers also wear gloves to improve their grip on the ball, and to protect themselves from injury. Some gloves now include rigid plastic spines down each finger to help prevent injuries such as jammed, fractured, and sprained fingers. Though gloves are not mandatory attire, it is uncommon for goalkeepers to opt against them due to the advantages they offer. At UEFA Euro 2004, Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo famously took off his gloves during the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against England, knowing he was the next taker for his side. He then went on to save Darius Vassell's penalty using his bare hands before scoring his own kick to win it for Portugal.\n\nAfter recovering from a serious head injury that he had sustained in 2006, Petr Čech has subsequently worn a rugby style headguard during his matches.\n\nGoalkeepers often have longer playing careers than outfield players, many not retiring until their late thirties or early forties. This can be explained by noting that goalkeepers play a less physically demanding position that requires significantly less running. For example, Peter Shilton played for 31 years between 1966 and 1997 before retiring at the age of 47. Another explanation of this is that due to the nature of this position, goalkeepers use their experience more often than field players.\n\nLower and upper extremity injuries are very common and vary from cartilage tears, anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL), and knee sprains. In general, goalkeepers can incur any injury that their outfield counterparts are also vulnerable to. The main exception to this guideline is that goalkeepers, as they run much less than outfield players, very rarely fall victim to fatigue-related injuries, such as leg cramps, pulled hamstrings, and dehydration.\n\nGoalkeepers are crucial in penalty shoot-outs. The record for most penalties saved in a shoot-out is held by Helmuth Duckadam of Steaua București. Duckadam defended four consecutive penalties in the 1986 European Cup Final against Barcelona. Stefano Tacconi is the only goalkeeper to have won all official club competitions (that he was eligible for).\n\nJosé Luis Chilavert is the only goalkeeper to score a hat-trick (three goals in a game), doing so through penalty kicks. He also was a free kick expert. Rogério Ceni has scored the most goals for a goalkeeper, having scored his 100th goal in official games on 27 March 2011. Ceni scored his goals through free kicks and penalty kicks.\n\nGianluigi Buffon is currently the only goalkeeper to have won the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year Award. Oliver Kahn holds the record for most UEFA Best Club Goalkeeper and Best European Goalkeeper Awards, with four. Iker Casillas holds the record for most appearances by a goalkeeper in the FIFPro World XI, and in the UEFA Team of the Year; he also holds the record for the most IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper Awards, alongside Buffon, winning the Award for five consecutive years between 2008–2012. Casillas also holds the record for the most clean-sheets in UEFA Champions League history.\n\nAt international level, Dino Zoff is the goalkeeper who has remained unbeaten for the longest period of time, whilst Walter Zenga holds the record for the longest unbeaten run in a FIFA World Cup tournament, as he went unbeaten for 517 minutes in the 1990 edition of the tournament. Gianluigi Buffon, Fabien Barthez and Iker Casillas hold the record for fewest goals conceded by a winning goalkeeper in a World Cup tournament, only conceding two goals and leading their team to victory, as they were also awarded the Yashin Award for best keeper. Gianluigi Buffon is also the only World Cup winning goalkeeper not to have conceded a goal in open play throughout the whole tournament (one goal coming from an own goal after a free-kick, and the second from a penalty). Fabien Barthez and Peter Shilton hold the record for most clean sheets in World Cup matches, with 10 clean sheets each. Mohamed Al-Deayea holds the record for most international caps by a goalkeeper, with 178 official appearances for Saudi Arabia.\n\nPascal Zuberbühler holds the record for fewest goals conceded by a goalkeeper in a World Cup tournament and holds the record for most successive matches at an international tournament without conceding (five games), he did not concede a goal in 463 minutes of World Cup games against hard shots from France, South Korea, and Togo as his team lost in the last 16 on penalties against Ukraine. Zuberbühler made Switzerland the only team in the history of the tournament not to concede a goal in normal time. Tim Howard holds the record for most saves made in a FIFA World Cup match, with 16 saves against Belgium in the Round of 16 of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Oliver Kahn is the only goalkeeper to have won the Adidas Golden Ball for the best player of the tournament in a World Cup (in the 2002 competition); Lev Yashin is the only goalkeeper to have won the Ballon d'Or. Gianluca Pagliuca of Italy became the first goalkeeper to be sent off in a World Cup Finals match, dismissed for handling outside his area against Norway in 1994. His team went on to win 1–0 and reached the final before losing to Brazil in a penalty shoot-out, in which he became the first goalkeeper ever to stop a penalty in a final shoot-out.\n\nIker Casillas holds both the record for fewest goals conceded in a European Championship (1, in 2012) and the record for longest unbeaten run at a European Championship, beating the previous record held by Dino Zoff. He also holds the records for most international clean sheets (102) by a male goalkeeper beating the previous record held by Edwin van der Sar (72), and became the first goalkeeper in history, male or female, to keep 100 clean sheets at international level in 2015; he also shares the overall record for the most international clean sheets along with the U.S. women's national team goalkeeper Hope Solo. Buffon holds the record for most minutes without conceding a goal in European Championship Qualifying matches, going 644 minutes without conceding a goal.\n\n, the most expensive goalkeeper of all time was Kepa Arrizabalaga following his 2018 €80 million (£71 million) transfer to Chelsea from Athletic Bilbao.\n\n"}

The first recorded record transfer was of Willie Groves from West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa for £100 in 1893. This occurred just eight years after the introduction of professionalism by The Football Association in 1885. The current transfer record was set by the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain for €222 million (£198 million) on 3 August 2017.\n\nMost of the transfers on this list are to clubs under UEFA's jurisdiction, and most of the purchasing clubs are from England, France, Italy and Spain. However, since the mid 2010s two Chinese clubs have paid large fees for three Brazilian players.\n\nThree players appear on the list twice: Neymar, Ángel Di María and Cristiano Ronaldo. All of the players on the list are of European (UEFA), South American (CONMEBOL) and African (CAF) origin. There are currently no players from the remaining regions - Asia (AFC), North America (CONCACAF) and Oceania (OFC).\n\n\"As of 19 July 2018\"\n\nNotes\n\nThe first player to ever be transferred for a fee of over £100 was Scottish striker Willie Groves when he together with Jack Reynolds (£50) made the switch from West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa in 1893, eight years after the legalisation of professionalism in the sport. It took just twelve years for the figure to become £1000, when Sunderland striker Alf Common moved to Middlesbrough.\n\nIt was not until 1928 that the first five-figure transfer took place. David Jack of Bolton Wanderers was the subject of interest from Arsenal, and in order to negotiate the fee down, Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman got the Bolton representatives drunk. Subsequently, David Jack was transferred for a world record fee when Arsenal paid £10,890 to Bolton for his services, after Bolton had asked for £13,000, which was double the previous record made when Sunderland signed Burnley's Bob Kelly a fee of for £6,500.\n\nThe first player from outside Great Britain to break the record was Bernabé Ferreyra, a player known as \"La Fiera\" for his powerful shot. His 1932 transfer from Tigre to River Plate cost £23k, and the record would last for 17 years (the longest the record has lasted) until it was broken by Manchester United's sale of Johnny Morris to Derby County for £24k in March 1949. The record was broken seven further times between 1949 and 1961, when Luis Suárez Miramontes was sold by FC Barcelona to Inter Milan for £152k, becoming the first ever player sold for more than £100k.\n\nIn 1968, Pietro Anastasi became the first £500k player when Juventus purchased him from Varese, which was followed seven years later with Giuseppe Savoldi becoming the first million pound player when he transferred from Bologna to Napoli.\n\nAfter Alf Common and David Jack, the third player to twice be transferred for world record fees is Diego Maradona. His transfers from Boca Juniors to Barcelona for £3m, and then to Napoli for £5m, both broke the record in 1982 and 1984 respectively. The most recent is Ronaldo with his record-breaking move from PSV Eindhoven to Barcelona in 1996 for £13.2m, although Alan Shearer's transfer to Newcastle broke the record the same summer. A year later Inter Milan paid £19.5m for Ronaldo and again he became the player with the highest transfer fee.\n\nIn the space of 61 days in 1992, three transfers broke the record, all by Italian clubs: Jean-Pierre Papin transferred from Marseille to A.C. Milan, becoming the first ever £10m player. Almost immediately, rivals Juventus topped that with the signing of Gianluca Vialli for a fee of £12m from Sampdoria. Milan then completed the signing of Gianluigi Lentini for a fee of £13m which stood as the record for three years.\n\nThe 1996 transfer of Alan Shearer from Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United, for a fee of £15m, kickstarted a year-by-year succession of record breaking transfers: Ronaldo moved the following year to Inter Milan from FC Barcelona for a fee of £17m, which was followed in 1998 by the shock transfer of his fellow countryman Denílson from São Paulo to Real Betis for a fee of approximately £21m.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, Italian clubs returned to their record-breaking ways, with Christian Vieri transferring from Lazio to Inter Milan for £28m, while Hernán Crespo's transfer from Parma to Lazio ensured he became the first player to cost more than £30m. The transfer prompted the BBC to ask \"has the world gone mad\"? It took two weeks for the record to be broken when Luís Figo made a controversial £37m move from Barcelona to rivals Real Madrid. A year later, Real increased the record again with a signing of Zinedine Zidane for £48 million (150 billion lire).\n\nZidane's record stood for 8 years, the longest since the 1940s. Real Madrid continued with the \"Galácticos\" policy by buying Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£56 million), which was the world record in pound sterling. However, both world record in euro and in pound sterling were broke by Real themselves when signing Cristiano Ronaldo for £80m (€94m) from Manchester United in the same transfer window, 4 years later Real Madrid broke the record again after completed the signing of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013. Although Real initially insisted that the transfer cost €91.59 million, slightly less than the Ronaldo fee, the deal was widely reported to be around €100 million (around £85.1 million). Documents leaked in 2016 by Football Leaks revealed that installments brought the final Bale fee up to a total of €100,759,418. In 2016, Manchester United eventually took the record away from Real Madrid, signing French midfielder Paul Pogba for €105 million (£89 million), four years after having released him to Juventus for training compensation.\n\nA year after the Pogba transfer, however, there was a major jump in the record fee. Paris St. Germain matched the €222 million buyout fee of Barcelona's Neymar, converted to a reported £198 million or £200 million by different sources. This was the first time that the record fee was paid by a French club.\n\nComparison of fees in different nations is complicated by varying exchange rates. This table uses British Pound Sterling prior to 1999 and Euro from 1999 to present.\n"}
{"id": "175283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175283", "title": "Mesoamerican ballgame", "text": "Mesoamerican ballgame\n\nThe Mesoamerican ballgame was a sport with ritual associations played since 1400 BC by the pre-Columbian people of Ancient Mesoamerica. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a newer more modern version of the game, \"ulama\", is still played in a few places by the indigenous population.\n\nThe rules of the game are not known, but judging from its descendant, ulama, they were probably similar to racquetball, where the aim is to keep the ball in play. The stone ballcourt goals are a late addition to the game.\n\nIn the most common theory of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions allowed the use of forearms, rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber and weighed as much as 4 kg (9 lbs), and sizes differed greatly over time or according to the version played.\n\nThe game had important ritual aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events. Late in the history of the game, some cultures occasionally seem to have combined competitions with religious human sacrifice. The sport was also played casually for recreation by children and may have been played by women as well.\n\nPre-Columbian ballcourts have been found throughout Mesoamerica, as for example at Copán, as far south as modern Nicaragua, and possibly as far north as what is now the U.S. state of Arizona. These ballcourts vary considerably in size, but all have long narrow alleys with slanted side-walls against which the balls could bounce.\n\nThe Mesoamerican ballgame is known by a wide variety of names. In English, it is often called pok-ta-pok (or pok-a-tok). This term originates from a 1932 article by Danish archaeologist Frans Blom, who adapted it from the Yucatec Maya word \"pokolpok\". In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, it was called \"ōllamaliztli\" () or \"tlachtli\" (). In Classical Maya, it was known as \"pitz\". In modern Spanish, it is called \"juego de pelota maya\" (\"Maya ballgame\"), \"juego de pelota mesoamericano\" (\"Mesoamerican ballgame\"), or simply \"pelota maya\" (\"Maya ball\").\n\nIt is not known precisely when or where ōllamaliztli originated, although it is likely that the game originated earlier than 1400 BCE in the low-lying tropical zones home to the rubber tree.\n\nOne candidate for the birthplace of the ballgame is the Soconusco coastal lowlands along the Pacific Ocean. Here, at Paso de la Amada, archaeologists have found the oldest ballcourt yet discovered, dated to approximately 1400 BCE.\n\nThe other major candidate is the Olmec heartland, across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec along the Gulf Coast. The Aztecs referred to their Postclassic contemporaries who then inhabited the region as the \"Olmeca\" (i.e. \"rubber people\") since the region was strongly identified with latex production. The earliest-known rubber balls come from the sacrificial bog at El Manatí, an early Olmec-associated site located in the hinterland of the Coatzacoalcos River drainage system. Villagers, and subsequently archaeologists, have recovered a dozen balls ranging in diameter from 10 to 22 cm from the freshwater spring there. Five of these balls have been dated to the earliest-known occupational phase for the site, approximately 1700–1600 BCE. These rubber balls were found with other ritual offerings buried at the site, indicating that even at this early date ōllamaliztli had religious and ritual connotations. A stone \"yoke\" of the type frequently associated with Mesoamerican ballcourts was also reported to have been found by local villagers at the site, leaving open the distinct possibility that these rubber balls were related to the ritual ballgame, and not simply an independent form of sacrificial offering.\n\nExcavations at the nearby Olmec site of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán have also uncovered a number of ballplayer figurines, radiocarbon-dated as far back as 1250–1150 BCE. A rudimentary ballcourt, dated to a later occupation at San Lorenzo, 600–400 BCE, has also been identified.\n\nFrom the tropical lowlands, ōllamaliztli apparently moved into central Mexico. Starting around 1000 BCE or earlier, ballplayer figurines were interred with burials at Tlatilco and similarly styled figurines from the same period have been found at the nearby Tlapacoya site. It was about this period, as well, that the so-called Xochipala-style ballplayer figurines were crafted in Guerrero. Although no ballcourts of similar age have been found in Tlatilco or Tlapacoya, it is possible that the ballgame was indeed played in these areas, but on courts with perishable boundaries or temporary court markers.\n\nBy 300 BCE, evidence for ōllamaliztli appears throughout much of the Mesoamerican archaeological record, including ballcourts in the Central Chiapas Valley (the next oldest ballcourts discovered, after Paso de la Amada), and in the Oaxaca Valley, as well as ceramic ballgame tableaus from Western Mexico (see photo below\n\nAs might be expected with a game played over such a long period of time by many cultures, details varied over time and place, so the Mesoamerican ballgame might be more accurately seen as a family of related games.\n\nIn general, the hip-ball version is most popularly thought of as \"the\" Mesoamerican ballgame, and researchers believe that this version was the primary—or perhaps only—version played within the masonry ballcourt. Ample archaeological evidence exists for games where the ball was struck by a wooden stick (e.g., a mural at Teotihuacan shows a game which resembles field hockey), racquets, bats and batons, handstones, and the forearm, perhaps at times in combination. Each of the various types of games had its own size of ball, specialized gear and playing field, and rules.\n\nGames were played between two teams of players. The number of players per team could vary, between two to four. Some games were played on makeshift courts for simple recreation while others were formal spectacles on huge stone ballcourts leading to human sacrifice.\n\nEven without human sacrifice, the game could be brutal and there were often serious injuries inflicted by the solid, heavy ball. Today's hip-\"ulama\" players are \"perpetually bruised\" while nearly 500 years ago Spanish chronicler Diego Durán reported that some bruises were so severe that they had to be lanced open. He also reported that players were even killed when the ball \"hit them in the mouth or the stomach or the intestines\".\n\nThe rules of ōllamaliztli, regardless of the version, are not known in any detail. In modern-day \"ulama\", the game resembles a netless volleyball, with each team confined to one half of the court. In the most widespread version of \"ulama\", the ball is hit back and forth using only the hips until one team fails to return it or the ball leaves the court.\n\nIn the Postclassic period, the Maya began placing vertical stone rings on each side of the court, the object being to pass the ball through one, an innovation that continued into the later Toltec and Aztec cultures.\n\nIn the 16th-century Aztec ballgame that the Spaniards witnessed, points were lost by a player who let the ball bounce more than twice before returning it to the other team, who let the ball go outside the boundaries of the court, or who tried and failed to pass the ball through one of the stone rings placed on each wall along the center line. According to 16th-century Aztec chronicler Motolinia, points were gained if the ball hit the opposite end wall, while the decisive victory was reserved for the team that put the ball through a ring. However, placing the ball through the ring was a rare event—the rings at Chichen Itza, for example, were set six meters off the playing field—and most games were likely won on points.\n\nThe game's paraphernalia—clothing, headdresses, gloves, all but the stone—are long gone, so knowledge on clothing relies on art—paintings and drawings, stone reliefs, and figurines—to provide evidence for pre-Columbian ballplayer clothing and gear, which varied considerably in type and quantity. Capes and masks, for example, are shown on several Dainzú reliefs, while Teotihuacan murals show men playing stick-ball in skirts.\n\nThe basic hip-game outfit consisted of a loincloth, sometimes augmented with leather hip guards. Loincloths are found on the earliest ballplayer figurines from Tlatilco, Tlapacoya, and the Olmec culture, are seen in the Weiditz drawing from 1528 (below), and, with hip guards, are the sole outfit of modern-day \"ulama\" players (above)—a span of nearly 3000 years.\n\nIn many cultures, further protection was provided by a thick girdle, most likely of wicker or wood covered in fabric or leather. Made of perishable materials, none of these girdles have survived, although many stone \"yokes\" have been uncovered. Misnamed by earlier archaeologists due to its resemblance to an animal yoke, the stone yoke is thought to be too heavy for actual play and was likely used only before or after the game in ritual contexts. In addition to providing some protection from the ball, the girdle or yoke would also have helped propel the ball with more force than the hip alone. Additionally, some players wore chest protectors called \"palmas\" which were inserted into the yoke and stood upright in front of the chest.\n\nKneepads are seen on a variety of players from many areas and eras and are worn by forearm-\"ulama\" players today. A type of garter is also often seen, worn just below the knee or around the ankle—it is not known what function this served. Gloves appear on the purported ballplayer reliefs of Dainzú, roughly 500 BCE, as well as the Aztec players drawn by Weiditz 2000 years later (see drawing below). Helmets (likely utilitarian) and elaborate headdresses (likely used only in ritual contexts) are also common in ballplayer depictions, headdresses being particularly prevalent on Maya painted vases or on Jaina Island figurines. Many ballplayers of the Classic era are seen with a right kneepad—no left—and a wrapped right forearm, as shown in the Maya image above.\n\nThe sizes or weights of the balls actually used in the ballgame are not known with any certainty. While several dozen ancient balls have been recovered, they were originally laid down as offerings in a sacrificial bog or spring, and there is no evidence that any of these were used in the ballgame. In fact, some of these extant votive balls were created specifically \"as\" offerings.\n\nHowever, based on a review of modern-day game balls, ancient rubber balls, and other archaeological evidence, it is presumed by most researchers that the ancient hip-ball was made of a mix from one or another of the latex-producing plants found all the way from the southeastern rain forests to the northern desert. Most balls were made from latex sap of the lowland \"Castilla elastica\" tree. Someone discovered that by mixing latex with sap from the vine of a species of morning glory (\"Calonyction aculeatum\") they could turn the slippery polymers in raw latex into a resilient rubber. The size varied between (measured in hand spans) and weighed . The ball used in the ancient handball or stick-ball game was probably slightly larger and heavier than a modern-day baseball.\n\nSome Maya depictions, such as the painting above or , show balls or more in diameter. Academic consensus is that these depictions are exaggerations or symbolic, as are, for example, the impossibly unwieldy headdresses worn in the same portrayals.\n\nŌllamaliztli was played within a large masonry structure. Built in a form that changed remarkably little during 2700 years, over 1300 Mesoamerican ballcourts have been identified, 60% in the last 20 years alone. Although there is a tremendous variation in size, in general all ballcourts have the same shape: a long narrow playing alley flanked by walls with both horizontal and sloping (or, more rarely, vertical) surfaces. The walls were often plastered and brightly painted. Although the alleys in early ballcourts were open-ended, later ballcourts had enclosed end-zones, giving the structure an -shape when viewed from above.\nAlthough the length-to-width ratio remained relatively constant at 4-to-1, there was nonetheless tremendous variation in ballcourt size. The playing field of the Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza, by far the largest, measures 96.5 meters long by 30 meters wide, while the Ceremonial Court at Tikal was only 16 meters by 5 meters.\nAcross Mesoamerica, ballcourts were built and used for many generations. Although ballcourts are found within most sizable Mesoamerican ruins, they are not equally distributed across time or geography. For example, the Late Classic site of El Tajín, the largest city of the ballgame-obsessed Classic Veracruz culture, has at least 18 ballcourts, while Cantona, a nearby contemporaneous site, sets the record with 24. In contrast, northern Chiapas and the northern Maya Lowlands have relatively few, and ballcourts are conspicuously absent at some major sites, including Teotihuacan, Bonampak, and Tortuguero, although ōllamaliztli iconography has been found there.\n\nAncient cities with particularly fine ballcourts in good condition include Tikal, Yaxha, Copán, Coba, Iximche, Monte Albán, Uxmal, Chichen Itza, Yagul, Xochicalco, Mixco Viejo, and Zaculeu.\n\nBallcourts were public spaces used for a variety of elite cultural events and ritual activities like musical performances and festivals, and, of course, the ballgame. Pictorial depictions often show musicians playing at ballgames, while votive deposits buried at the Main Ballcourt at Tenochtitlan contained miniature whistles, ocarinas, and drums. A pre-Columbian ceramic from western Mexico shows what appears to be a wrestling match taking place on a ballcourt.\n\nŌllamaliztli was a ritual deeply ingrained in Mesoamerican cultures and served purposes beyond that of a mere sporting event. Fray Juan de Torquemada, a 16th-century Spanish missionary and historian, tells that the Aztec emperor Axayacatl played Xihuitlemoc, the leader of Xochimilco, wagering his annual income against several Xochimilco chinampas. Ixtlilxochitl, a contemporary of Torquemada, relates that Topiltzin, the Toltec king, played against three rivals, with the winner ruling over the losers.\n\nThese examples and others are cited by many researchers who have made compelling arguments that ōllamaliztli served as a way to defuse or resolve conflicts without genuine warfare, to settle disputes through a ballgame instead of a battle. Over time, then, the ballgame's role would expand to include not only external mediation, but also the resolution of competition and conflict within the society as well.\n\nThis \"boundary maintenance\" or \"conflict resolution\" theory would also account for some of the irregular distribution of ballcourts. Overall, there appears to be a negative correlation between the degree of political centralization and the number of ballcourts at a site. For example, the Aztec Empire, with a strong centralized state and few external rivals, had relatively few ballcourts while Middle Classic Cantona, with 24 ballcourts, had many diverse cultures residing there under a relatively weak state.\n\nOther scholars support these arguments by pointing to the warfare imagery often found at ballcourts:\n\n\nThe association between human sacrifice and the ballgame appears rather late in the archaeological record, no earlier than the Classic era. The association was particularly strong within the Classic Veracruz and the Maya cultures, where the most explicit depictions of human sacrifice can be seen on the ballcourt panels—for example at El Tajín (850–1100 CE) and at Chichen Itza (900–1200 CE)—as well as on the well-known from the Classic Veracruz site of Aparicio (700–900 CE). The Postclassic Maya religious and quasi-historical narrative, the Popol Vuh, also links human sacrifice with the ballgame (see below).\n\nCaptives were often shown in Maya art, and it is assumed that these captives were sacrificed after losing a rigged ritual ballgame. Rather than nearly nude and sometimes battered captives, however, the ballcourts at El Tajín and Chichen Itza show the sacrifice of practiced ballplayers, perhaps the captain of a team. Decapitation is particularly associated with the ballgame—severed heads are featured in much Late Classic ballgame art and appear repeatedly in the Popol Vuh. There has even been speculation that the heads and skulls were used as balls.\n\nLittle is known about the game's symbolic contents. Several themes recur in scholarly writing.\n\nAccording to an important Nahua source, the Leyenda de los Soles, the Toltec king Huemac played ball against the Tlalocs, with precious stones and quetzal feathers at stake. Huemac won the game. When instead of precious stones and feathers, the rain deities offered Huemac their young maize ears and maize leaves, Huemac refused. As a consequence of this vanity, the Toltecs suffered a four-year drought. The same ball game match, with its unfortunate aftermath, signified the beginning of the end of the Toltec reign.\n\nThe Maya Twin myth of the Popol Vuh establishes the importance of the game (referred to in Classic Maya as \"pitz\") as a symbol for warfare intimately connected to the themes of fertility and death. The story begins with the Hero Twins' father, Hun Hunahpu, and uncle, Vucub Hunahpu, playing ball near the underworld, Xibalba. The lords of the underworld became annoyed with the noise from the ball playing and so the primary lords of Xibalba, One Death and Seven Death, sent owls to lure the brothers to the ballcourt of Xibalba, situated on the western edge of the underworld. Despite the danger the brothers fall asleep and are captured and sacrificed by the lords of Xibalba and then buried in the ballcourt. Hun Hunahpu is decapitated and his head hung in a fruit tree, which bears the first calabash gourds. Hun Hunahpu's head spits into the hands of a passing goddess who conceives and bears the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque. The Hero Twins eventually find the ballgame equipment in their father’s house and start playing, again to the annoyance of the Lords of Xibalba, who summon the twins to play the ballgame amidst trials and dangers. In one notable episode, Hunahpu is decapitated by bats. His brother uses a squash as Hunahpu's substitute head until his real one, now used as a ball by the Lords, can be retrieved and placed back on Hunahpu's shoulders. The twins eventually go on to play the ballgame with the Lords of Xibalba, defeating them. However, the twins are unsuccessful in reviving their father, so they leave him buried in the ball court of Xibalba.\n\nIn Maya Ballgame the Hero Twins myth links ballcourts with death and its overcoming. The ballcourt becomes a place of transition, a liminal stage between life and death. The ballcourt markers along the centerline of the Classic playing field depicted ritual and mythical scenes of the ballgame, often bordered by a quatrefoil that marked a portal into another world. The Twins themselves, however, are usually absent from Classic ballgame scenes, with the Vucub Caquix of the Copán ball court babe, holding the severed arm of Hunahpu, as an important exception.\n\nNo ballcourt has yet been identified at Teotihuacan, making it by far the largest Classic era site without one. In fact, the ballgame seems to have been nearly forsaken not only in Teotihuacan, but in areas such as Matacapan or Tikal that were under Teotihuacano influence.\n\nDespite the lack of a ballcourt, ball games were not unknown there. The murals of the Tepantitla compound at Teotihuacan show a number of small scenes that seem to portray various types of ball games, including:\n\nIt has been hypothesized that, for reasons as yet unknown, the stick-game eclipsed the hip-ball game at Teotihuacan and at Teotihuacan-influenced cities, and only after the fall of Teotihuacan did the hip-game reassert itself.\n\nThe Aztec version of the ballgame is called \"ōllamalitzli\" (sometimes spelled \"ullamaliztli\") and are derived from the word \"ōlli\" \"rubber\" and the verb \"ōllama\" or \"to play ball\". The ball itself was called \"ōllamaloni\" and the ballcourt was called a \"tlachtli\" . In the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan the largest ballcourt was called \"Teotlachco\" (\"in the holy ballcourt\")—here several important rituals would take place on the festivals of the month Panquetzalitzli, including the sacrifice of four war captives to the honor of Huitzilopochtli and his herald PaInal.\n\nFor the Aztecs the playing of the ballgame also had religious significance, but where the 16th-century K´iche´ Maya saw the game as a battle between the lords of the underworld and their earthly adversaries, their Aztec contemporaries may have seen it as a battle of the sun, personified by Huitzilopochtli, against the forces of night, led by the moon and the stars, and represented by the goddess Coyolxauhqui and Coatlicue's sons the 400 Huitznahuah. But apart from holding important ritual and mythical meaning, the ballgame for the Aztecs was a sport and a pastime played for fun, although in general the Aztec game was a prerogative of the nobles.\n\nYoung Aztecs would be taught ballplaying in the calmecac school—and those who were most proficient might become so famous that they could play professionally. Games would frequently be staged in the different city wards and markets—often accompanied by large-scale betting. Diego Durán, an early Spanish chronicler, said that \"these wretches... sold their children in order to bet and even staked themselves and became slaves\".\n\nSince the rubber tree \"Castilla elastica\" was not found in the highlands of the Aztec Empire, the Aztecs generally received balls and rubber as tribute from the lowland areas where it was grown. The \"Codex Mendoza\" gives a figure of 16,000 lumps of raw rubber being imported to Tenochtitlan from the southern provinces every six months, although not all of it was used for making balls.\n\nIn 1528, soon after the Spanish conquest, Cortés sent a troupe of \"ōllamanime\" (ballplayers) to Spain to perform for Charles V where they were drawn by the German Christoph Weiditz. Besides the fascination with their exotic visitors, the Europeans were amazed by the bouncing rubber balls.\n\nBallcourts, monuments with ballgame imagery and ballgame paraphernalia have been excavated at sites along the Pacific coast of Guatemala and El Salvador including the Cotzumalhuapa nuclear zone sites of Bilbao and El Baúl and sites right at the southeast periphery of the Mesoamerican region such as Quelepa.\n\nBatey, a ball game played on many Caribbean islands including Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the West Indies, has been proposed as a descendent of the Mesoamerican ballgame, perhaps through the Maya.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45241529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45241529", "title": "Misogyny in sports", "text": "Misogyny in sports\n\nMisogyny in sports refers to different discourses, actions and ideologies present in various sporting environments that add, reinforce, or normalize the objectification, degrading, shaming, or absence of women. It can range from limiting women's participation to informal reinforcement of the men's status, by comparing it to that of a woman. Misogyny within sports can also include unfair wages, as well as reduced coverage in sports media. Because sports are so popular in today's society, they can be seen as a microcosm for the way people view their culture.\n\nTraditionally, the views of women's involvement in sports has led many to believe that they are absent from inclusion altogether. For much of history, most of the discussion around women and sports was centered around health risks for upper-class, white women, while excluding those of non-white or homosexual orientation. As of 2013, female athletes receive an average of 63,000 fewer opportunities than men at NCAA institutions.\n\nWomen's participation in various sports, such as boxing or rugby union, has grown in recent years. However, there is still an undertone that they don't belong, by calling into question their sexuality or femininity. A 1993 study conducted by Michael Messner found that women were described using words like \"girls\" and \"young women\", while men were described using words like \"young man\" and \"men\" but never as \"boys.\" The same study found also found instances of women's successes and failures being described as \"her little jump hook\", adding to the notion that women are less talented or skilled than their male counterparts.\n\nRecent examples of domestic violence against women in various sports have highlighted the deeply rooted misogyny present in most sports. Similarly, the masculinity that is involved in many sporting activities allow men to assume that they have \"the right to vent their anger on the bodies of women and to discriminate against women in a number of different ways, including sexualizing and marginalizing them\" says Kath Woodward, Professor of Sociology at the Open University.\n\nMany of the messages that are delivered to male sports participants are about being tougher than your opponent, and the toughest one wins. The worst thing to be called or compared to in sports is a woman, and the quickest way to cut someone down. Coaches and pop culture constantly deliver messages that emphasize hyper-masculinity. However, all too often the societal frame of being a man is one that undermines women. These behaviors are seen as normal in the male-dominated sports world.\n\nThe sexism experienced by women in sports also tends to be more overt, and less subtle, than sexism in other work and organizational settings. Sexist remarks made in many workplaces have been discouraged by displays of social disapproval and the potential threat of organizational reprimand. This has forced misogynistic views to be more subtle in these settings, taking the form of microaggressions or remarks in the form of benevolent sexism. In the sports industry, in comparison, overt sexist remarks are still commonplace and tend to result in less public backlash than similar statements given in other settings. Female athletes do not receive more attention or opportunities as compared to their male counterparts. Misogyny in sports make many people perceive women as weaklings in sporting activities. Recently, the number of females in sports has increased but not in the same percentage with that of males. For example, only fewer women participate in games such as rugby and boxing. In 2015, Don McPherson, a former National Football League (NFL) quarterback, argued that in sports boys are raised not only to be men but also not to be women (California Institute of Integral Studies). In other words, he meant that coaches ensure that young males gain enough strength to face their opponents and discourage these players to fear, which is a character associated with femininity. In sporting activities, to be masculine means to possess skills, energy, and toughness to become the victor in many tournaments. Misogyny in sports is a significant factor that contributes to shaming, objectifying, and degrading women regardless of their performance on the playing field.\n\nMisogyny refers to hatred or prejudice towards women. It is manifested in several ways, such as hostility, sex discrimination, and social exclusion. Despite the popularity of sports in many societies in the world, misogyny is still prevalent in sports. In recent times, media coverage has increased the popularity of sports, but women's sports still suffers. It would be expected that both men's and women's sports are equally promoted on the media, such as television, radio and print media. Unfortunately, the coverage of women sports remains lower and shows no signs improvement; hence misogyny in media coverage of women's sports is confirmed.\n\nThere is little improvement in the coverage of women's sports by the media. The Women's Sports and Fitness Foundation reports that only 7% percent of media coverage is devoted to women's sport. This is discouraging based on findings that over 60% of sports fans would like to watch women's sport on television. Discouragingly, the media coverage of these sports is dominated by terms, such as older, pregnant, married and unmarried thus shifting the attention from sports. In the same regard, Kelly (1) reports that men are three times likely to be mentioned in sports media than women, in a language that focuses on the sporting aspect and not the aesthetic aspects.\n\nThe efforts to popularize women sports through media coverage dependents on the online presence of broadcasters on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. However, Hull (4) reports that little efforts are being undertaken in respect to the same. A sampling of an estimated twenty thousand tweets involving two hundred broadcasters of local sports in the United States of America showed that only 5% of the tweets were related to women's sports (Hull 5). Besides, the study revealed worrying findings that female sports broadcasters tweeted more on men's sports than women's. Worst of all, the sports broadcasters in larger cities were found to be unlikely to report on women's sports.\n\nDespite the increasing viewership of women's sports, there remains a larger disparity in the sports coverage for men's and women's sports. Findings of a study by the Birmingham University indicates the top six newspaper in Britain had fewer stories on women sports than the previous year when Olympics was taking place. Stories concerning women's sports were outnumbered by the stories on men's sport by twenty times. These newspapers were: The mirror, sun, Times, Mail, Express, Mirror, and Telegraph. The same study explains that a year after the 2012 Olympics, 97% of the sports coverage was on men's sports (Martinson 1). Furthermore, the study went ahead to link this scenario to the shortage of female sports journalists.\n\nMedia is influenced by many aspects of society. Equally, sporting activities attracts the attention of many people in the society. Therefore, the perception of the society towards equality and respect to women can be improved through increased coverage of women's sports on the media. The misogyny in the society can be said to be caused by the reluctance of media people to give adequate coverage to women's sports. We cannot be aiming to achieve parity in sports when the media devotes less than 5% of media coverage on women's sports. At the same time, the coverage of the women's sport should focus on sports and not on aesthetics and sexuality. Change is urgently needed to reverse this. This change is welcome because it will influence the societies' perception towards women. Perhaps, more women should be encouraged to develop careers in sports journalism for this to be realized. Despite the existing situation, it is good to remain hopeful that women's sport will be given increased coverage because many fans are would love to see these sports on their screens.\n\nWomen's sports have been underrepresented in comparison to men in their respective sports. In 2009, SportsCenter dedicated only 1.4% of its airtime to women sports, down from 2.2% in 1999. In an article published in 2013 by \"Science Daily\", they pointed out that over 2 years, only 3.6% of articles from five national Sunday papers discussed women sports, compared to 93.8% of articles devoted to men's sports.\n\nOver the course of the NBA (National Basketball Association) and WNBA (Women’s National Basketball Association) in-season and off-season in 2009, a study was done based on the number of stories and airtime each league had. The NBA had 72 stories totaling 66 minutes in-season and 81 stories totaling 51 minutes in the off-season. Which is significantly more than 8 stories at 5.5 minutes in-season, and 0 stories in the off-season for the WNBA. The quality of the stories themselves was significantly lower than the men, including gag stories involving sexual dialogue or emphasizing their bodies. Regarding the games themselves, the women’s had lower quality, editing mistakes, and fewer camera angles. \n\nResearch has shown that children start to learn stereotypical attitudes towards gender-appropriate actions at a very early age, and traditional images in print photographs and advertising reinforce typical gender roles. Media plays a powerful role in shaping children's perception, more so than text as children develop a sense of visual literacy earlier than written literacy. A 1990 study concluded that two thirds of photos in reading primers were of men, often shown leading more action-packed, and significant lives than the women depicted in the photographs. Several studies have shown that women are often framed as sexual objects and lesser competitors, as well as displaying more emotion than men, in many sports photographs. Many media studies suggest that they continue to \"reinforce the hegemonic image that sport is a right of passage for men.\" Studies suggest that in Sports Illustrated, which has been labeled the most influential sports publication, men are the preeminent figures featured in photographs and feature articles within the magazine. When women are underrepresented, there is an underlying message being conveyed that they don't belong, don't exist, or have not accomplished anything.\n\nIn the UK, media talks of re-signing convicted rapist Ched Evans to Sheffield United Football Club. Additionally, misogynistic leaflets were distributed by a rugby team at one of the country’s most prestigious universities, the London School of Economics. These are only a few of the most recent examples. Problems with gender persist.\n\nSome publicity given to the NFL scandals in the US and the Oscar Pistorius trial in South Africa some argue show the endurance of patriarchal power structures. They might be signs of deeply embedded misogyny within sports internationally.\n\nThe pay gap in sports seems to arise depending on the gender and the type of sport. Based on athletics data in 2009, female athletes earned 23.4 percent less than male athletes. In 2014, based on Arsenal's performance data, Arsenal's women soccer team earned less than the men's team. The women's team earned five thousand dollars as opposed to the men's whose pay scale was $1.8 million. This gap does not only apply to athletes, but also to members of the teams coaching staff.\n\nMany studies have been conducted to discover the emergence of the pay gap in sports. An employment strategy conducted in European Union member states shows disparity in pay between male and females. The investigation was how players and coaches are paid determined by gender and the sport they participate in. The results showed that the coaches of the male team had a much greater salary than the coaches of the women's team. In 2001, the average salary for coaches of woman's teams in Division 1 was $38,191, while coaches of men's teams earned an average of $61,534. At Division 1 I-FBS Schools in the USA, the median head coaches' salaries were $2,257,600 higher for men in comparison to their women counterparts. A study conducted by Michigan State University found that the salaries for both men and women Division 1 coaches was determined by both gender and type of sport. It showed that coaching males has a more positive impact on a coaches salary than coaching females did, and because of this, both athletic directors and men's coaches have a high interest in maintaining and reinforcing the status quo, which indicates that the lowest paying coaching jobs are held by women.\n\nOn the other hand, tennis remains as the one sport that has the most comparable and fair pay between men and women. Tennis receives the most media coverage than any other women’s sport, and through social media, is continuing to experience growth in popularity. According to Forbes, eight of the top ten best paid women athletes are tennis players. A 2009 research conducted by three professors from Brigham Young University found that male and female tennis players have the same employers at 21 events, including the four grand-slam tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open). While, in most other sports, women’s associations have different sponsorships and media coverage.\n\nThe 2007 Wimbledon Championships was the first tournament that offered equal prize money for male and female athletes. However, while this may be the case during televised events and the grand slams, women are still not receiving as much in middle- and low- tier events; the most popular rationalization being that men play longer. Although it is true that men players are required to play a best-of-5 set and that women players are only required to play best-of-3-sets, other than during the grand slams, this does not apply to any other tournaments. Another argument for unequal pay is that men generate more revenue through higher television ratings and attendance. However, most tournament tickets grant spectators access to both men’s and women’s matches on that day. So, aside from counting the numbers of viewers per match, it is difficult to determine revenues in tournaments where both sexes play. Finally, there is also evidence that ratings are mostly equal, with some cases indicating women being higher than men.\n\nWomen’s annual median pay gap in the United States was 19% lower than the men.  Supporters of the continued wage gap tend to say that men deserve to be paid more because they are stronger and have greater attendance rates.  However, when examining statistics, this opinion is unsupported. In the 2015 Open, the men's champion, Novak Djokovic, served a 125 mph serve.  Serena Williams topped this by 1 mph.  In 2008 at Wimbledon, the fastest serve in the women’s final was 129 mph, the same as the fastest serve in the men’s final.  A fan of unfair pay may say that women deserve to be paid less because their sporting events are less entertaining.  However, the main reason for boredom in tennis is long, drawn out points, generally defined as nine rallies or more.  In the 2017 open, “long rallies” accounted for 11% of the points in men’s matches, with only about a 1% difference at 12.2% for women.  These supporters also like to complain that women tend to use backhands more often than forehands in comparison to men. Both are untrue as backhand winners fall in at 35.7% for women and 30.2% for men.  According to statistical analysis, women and men’s tennis games are within comparable measures.  As for attendance rates, these are difficult to calculate because most tickets for matches are sold as a pair for the women and men’s game.  The only true way to determine the audience size would be to do a head count at every match.\n\nThere are some who believe that the problem in trying to explain the gender pay gap, is that they are trying to justify why it exists instead of addressing the problem of why it exists in the first place. Karen Farquharson, who is a professor at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology, says the problem is a societal thing that results from not valuing women in the society. Karen admits that women are not strong as men but it does not mean they are not entertaining and competitive. The main reason why they remain less in sports is that the society is patriarchal and male-dominated especially when it comes to sports. This means that sports are like a vicious circle and broadcasters just take advantage of it to only broadcast male games continuously leaving out women thinking they are not interested.\n\nAdditionally, female athletes are still not receiving as much non-sexist and positive attention then male athletes. Women sometimes compete under certain conditions that give them less respect than their male peers. Women athletes still face problems of sexual harassment, and over-training associated with eating disorders and body image. The U.S. women’s soccer team, which is ranked much higher than the men’s, enjoy much less recognition, popularity, and pay. Such allegations and improper judgment on women have led some players to take a step and sue their federation for discrimination. On 30 March 2016, five top U.S women players, Hope Solo, Carli Lloyd, Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and Becky Sauerbrunn, filed a lawsuit against the Soccer Federation to demand equal employment opportunity. The complaint alleges that women on the national soccer team make about 40% of what their male counterparts do. Female athletes across all sports may win more trophies and medals, but more often than not, this does not translate to equal payment. Toughness of competition, more lenient rules, and difference in skill levels are just a couple excuses made to disregard this very real social issue.\n\nGirls and women have been discriminated and denied sports opportunities for quite a long time. For years, women and girls were comfortable with the stereotypes that were attached with the concept of women in sports but with time, different organizations and feminists have come up with strategies to uplift the participation rates of women and girls in sports.\n\nTitle IX for example is a legislation that was passed in 1972 to that provided different provisions that protected the rights of equality in sports for women and girls. It is a law that requires all educational programs receiving federal funding to provide equity for both boys and girls. Over the years, the law has been subject to over 20 proposed amendments, reviews, and Supreme Court cases. The law has acted as a way of motivating women and girls to participate more in sports.\n\nThe participation of girls and women in sports has brought about numerous immediate and long-term benefits that have a lasting impact on both the female gender and the society at large. Some of the different provisions of the ‘Title IX’ include equality in the different sports fields for both sexes. Essentially, this provision is aimed at placing women at an advantage in athletics and sports. However, it is important that such provisions do not necessarily imply that equal amounts are spent on sports activities and matters for both sexes and athletic opportunities for boys and men to be reduced but simply means that both women and girls should not be discouraged and denied any sports opportunities. But there are still thousands of schools across the county are not in compliance with Title IX. The law covers all educational activities that receive public funding, so even though sports receive little public funding, they are still subject to Title IX, and are the most well-known application of the law. Opponents of the law say that has led to a break down of men's sports, pointing to the number of schools and institutions that have dropped sports since the enactment of Title IX, such as wrestling and cross-country.\n\nPrior to the law, only 295,000 girls participated in high school sports and they received only 2% of the athletic budget. In 2016-2017, that number had risen to 3.4 million girls playing high school sports across the country.\n\nVarious studies have found that those who participate in high school athletics have higher wages, educational attainment, and educational aspirations later on in life. The rise in opportunities to participate in sports has led to a similar rise in labor force participation, which leads to more women with positive earnings.\n\nSince the enactment of Title IX, women have made strides in college athletics for years. Other factors such as body shaping and fan culture are some of the motivation strategies that concerned individuals in the society are taking up to increase women and girl’s participation in sports. However, it should be noted that more enforcement strategies need to be put in place to increase women and girl participation in sports since women discrimination in sports has not been completely eradicated since in some cases, women and girl’s participation in sports is not approved.\n\nBefore the Title IX, Equal Opportunity Law was established, not a single sports scholarship was given women in college sports in the United States. Since then, the number of scholarships given to women has increased each year to almost 85,000 scholarships in 2012, based on the “Number of Available College Athletic Scholarships” Compared to the 92,000 Scholarships available for men in that year.\n\nThe Title IX legislation was passed in 1972 and required schools that received federal funding to provide equality for boys and girls. Or having the same amount of male sports teams as women. Because of that, many schools or universities have dropped specific sports teams such as wrestling and men's soccer. Before the law, less than 300,000 girls participated in high school sports, receiving 2% of the sports budget. Since then, that number has increased to over 3.4 million girls playing high school sports across the United States.\n\nAlthough Title IX encouraged more women to participate in sports at an NCAA level, the number of women in leadership roles drastically decreased. Women in senior decision making roles devolved to a number of 18% and women in athletic director positions held only 17% in the year 2000. Although major strides have been taken by people in all realms of the sports industry to create more opportunities for women, women are still underrepresented in the industry as a whole. According to the NCAA, only 8.3% of Division I athletics directors are women. Only 21% of college women's athletic programs are headed by women, and women fill only 33% of all administrative jobs in women's programs. In high school, less than 20% of athletic directors are women, and less than 40% of directors of physical education are women. An American Society of New Editors (ASNE) newsroom census report in 1991 showed 63.1% of newsroom were men and 36.9% were women. In 2012, the percentages had not changed. By 2013, the statistics were slightly worse, showing 63.7% were men and 36.3% were women. Some issues still remaining in terms of gender inequality in sport include the pay gap discrepancies, lack of opportunities for women in a male dominant industry, and lack of media coverage for women athletes. While there are women who enter top management positions in this industry, men typically receive a greater number of opportunities. Hegemony is described as a state of a “ruling class” referring to men at the forefront of society. This concept reaffirms the status quo that men demand authority in a society from imposition, manipulation, and even consent from certain groups. Due to this restricting concept, women find it much harder to advance in leadership roles simply due to what has already been set in motion by previous generations and previous cultures.\n\nA study conducted by Alice Eagly and Steven Karau, two professors of psychology and management, explored the social role theory and role congruity theory in relation to how women and men assume different career and social roles based on societal expectations. Through the role congruity theory, Eagly and Karau explained similarities between gender roles and leadership roles, which suggested prejudice toward female leader and potential leaders take two forms. \"The first form showed a less favorable evaluation of women's potential for leadership because leadership ability is more stereotypical of men than women. The second form showed a less favorable evaluation of the actual leadership behavior of women than men because such behavior is perceived less desirable in women than men.\" This research established view points and supportive information on why there are less women in leadership roles than men throughout the sport industry.\n\nThe issues women face in sports off the field are not only unique to the United States, and as the spectrum broadens, one can see that the disparity of women in sports governance positions decreases. Some have suggested to require quotas for women to participate in governance of sports programs, but even this solution is flawed. Suggesting that a company makes requirements in their recruitment to seek out women would only be done to achieve a certain number, and not because they actually want to do so in the first place. Instead, these organizations should focus on achieving targets that come close to a standard of around 40% of women representation. This number has been positively associated with correct board governance and effectiveness.\n\nIn her book, \"Sexual Harassment in the Workplace\", Mary Boland argues that sexual harassment is a personal attack on a woman's mind and body, that installs fear and violates her right to bodily integrity education, and freedom of movement. According to the \"National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)\" \"working women face higher risks than men from job-related stress, and one of the most noxious stressors sexual harassment.\" In reference to the toll that it takes on women, Boland states \"victims suffer physical, mental, emotional, and financial losses that can be devastating.\" According to a study conducted by the Journal of Sport Management, over 50% of 112 respondents reported they encountered some form of sexual harassment over the past 12 months prior to the study. As reported by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida in 2012, 90% of sports editors and 88% of sports reporters are men. The disproportion between men and women in this position may discourage female sport media print professionals from reporting such incidents of sexual harassment according to an article published by Christina Coleburn.\n\nRegardless of the field in which women work, sexual harassment in the workplace is alive and well and in the sports industry, it is common. Women in powerful or governance position are often viewed as too assertive, thus receiving harassment for challenging the preconceived notion of a hierarchy. These women in power also report more instances of sexual harassment in the workplace, because of their threat to the status quo. Studies also suggest that a women in a supervisor position will report more instances of sexual harassment due to their intelligence, knowledge, and experience in a workplace environment where they hold power. Targets of sexual harassment are more likely to be female because they may have masculine tendencies, and men feel the need to reassure their “masculine dominance”. The lack of awareness of sexual harassment in the sports industry is extremely concerning for progressive movements towards equality. A study done in 2011 in Quebec called “Disclosure of Sexual Abuse in Sport Organizations: A Case Study” points to the many problems in sports organizations. Most instances point to women rarely, if ever, reporting assault or harassment in the sports business. Most coaches, athletes, and administrators were not even aware of existing protocols of sexual harassment. When questioned about this concerning issue, the administrators resorted back to their lawyers; assuming that the issue was for too complicated to tackle.\n\nThe USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal that occurred over the course of several years, but came to light in the latter months of 2017 and early 2018 involved former doctor Larry Nassar.  More than 250 young women accused Nassar of sexual harassment and abuse. Many of these women were seen and treated by Nassar as a gymnast. Because of his role as the USA gymnastics team doctor, Nassar was able to be alone with hundreds of young women and girls over the course of nearly two decades. Women can often be afraid to come forward with these allegations because of how it may affect their career and how others may see them afterwards. Aly Raisman, a USA Gymnast, explained how the abuse from Nassar had occurred from such a young age, that despite strange thoughts about his treatment methods, she was taught to trust him which is why it took so long to figure out what was happening to her and many other gymnasts and come forward about it.\n\nAccording to associate director of research at Pew Research Center, Katie Simmons, \"a woman's main role has always been to be a wife, and then a mother. Women have been stereotyped for years as being the less intellectual and weaker sex.\" Women are often objectified in the sport industry, and judged solely on the way they look, especially now when social media has become more and more mainstream. Discussed in the article \"Sports Journalism Has A Major Sexual Harassment Problem,\" women working in the sport industry infrequently report incidents where they have experienced sexual harassment and inappropriate comments throughout their careers due to fear or losing their job. One occupation that frequently experiences sexual harassment in the sport industry are female sport media print professionals. Female sport media print professionals are typically sports editors, sportswriters, sports columnists, and sports reporters.Women working in this sector of the sport industry have reported numerous incidents where they have experienced threatening comments, sexual abuse and harassment, or some form of intimidation.\n\n"}

Such metaphors also appear in the writings of contemporary philosophers, such as Epictetus and Philo, drawing on the tradition of the Olympic Games, and this may have influenced New Testament use of the imagery.\n\nThe metaphor of running a race \"with perseverance\" appears in Hebrews 12:1, and related metaphors appear in Philippians 2:16, Galatians 2:2, and Galatians 5:7. In 2 Timothy 4:7, Paul writes \"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.\"\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 9:24–26, written to the city that hosted the Isthmian Games, the metaphor is extended from running to other games, such as boxing, to make the point that winning a prize requires discipline, self-control, and coordinated activity. In 2 Timothy 2:5 the same point is made. These athletic metaphors are also echoed in later Christian writing.\n\nAs with New Testament military metaphors, these metaphors appear in many hymns, such as \"Fight the Good Fight with All Thy Might\", which was sung in the film \"Chariots of Fire\"; and \"Angel Band\", which was sung in the film \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\".\n\nNew Testament athletic metaphors were embraced by advocates of muscular Christianity, both in the Victorian era and in later times.\n\n"}
{"id": "1198164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1198164", "title": "Nosler", "text": "Nosler\n\nThe name Nosler applies to a number of companies involved in the manufacture of ammunition and handloading components, specializing in high performance hollow point and soft point hunting bullets. Current companies include Nosler, Inc., Nosler Custom, and Nosler Reloading. Nosler's contributions include both new bullet designs and new manufacturing techniques used in their production.\n\nJohn Nosler was born 4 April 1913 in Brawley, California. Nosler was hunting moose in British Columbia in 1946, when the bullets he was using failed to penetrate deeply enough to reach vital organs and kill the animal quickly. At the time, most jacketed bullets employed a single copper alloy envelope (the jacket) around a single lead alloy core. The jacket on most military bullets was closed in front and opened at the base. These full metal jacket bullets offered good penetration, but often failed to expand and passed completely through an animal leaving a comparatively small wound. Soft-point hunting bullets like Nosler was using had the jacket applied in the opposite direction to completely cover the base, but open at the nose. These bullets would expand to leave a large wound channel, but sometimes broke into small pieces with inadequate momentum to overcome resistance of moving through bone or muscle tissue.\n\nThe experience inspired Nosler to develop a new bullet design, intended to expand readily at low impact velocities yet maintain integrity at high impact velocities (see terminal ballistics). These \"Nosler Partition\" bullets used a specially designed jacket enclosing two separate lead alloy cores. The front core was open on the nose to expand easily, but expansion would stop at the partition (which was a solid layer of copper extending right across the bullet, not just the thin shell of copper which composed the jacket). The portion of the bullet behind the partition has the structural integrity of a full metal jacket bullet, but the expanded forward jacket leaves a larger wound channel. Bullets were originally manufactured for personal use, using hand made, lathe turned jackets. In 1948 Nosler began to sell the partition bullets commercially, forming Nosler, Inc.\n\nFurther innovations by Nosler included new techniques of manufacturing bullet jackets that yielded more consistent expansion, better core bonding techniques to prevent separation of the lead core from the copper jacket, and the plastic Ballistic Tip used to provide the streamlined shape of a Spitzer boat tail, with the expansion of a hollow point. The Nosler Ballistic Tip design has been copied by other manufacturers, such as the V-Max bullet by Hornady. John Nosler sold the production facilities to his son in 1988, and died at his home in Bend, Oregon, on 10 October 2010.\n\nToday, Nosler makes a number of different hunting bullets for rifle, handgun, and muzzle-loaders. They also manufacture brass and sell loaded ammunition, and Nosler Custom has recently begun to sell limited edition and semi-custom hunting rifles. The original Partition design bullet still is the company's flagship product. It has undergone many refinements over the years, but the basic design concept has remained unchanged.\n\nNosler experienced a massive explosion at their plant in Bend, Oregon on 2 June 2010. No one was harmed in the blast.\n\nIn February 2015, Nosler announced plans to expand their long-standing operations in Bend, Oregon to their neighboring city of Redmond, where the company purchased 60 acres of undeveloped land in December 2014. Construction of a 30,000 sq. ft. building is planned for completion in 2016 and will house Nosler’s growing ammunition and cartridge brass operations, including the manufacturing of their SSA by Nosler product line based on the company’s acquisition of Silver State Armory in 2013. The expansion is expected to add approximately 20 jobs in Central Oregon and will allow the original Bend plant to focus exclusively on bullet production.\n\nIn 2006 Nosler announced its very first rifle offering, the Model 48 Trophy Grade.\n\nNosler announced the company’s first proprietary cartridge, the 26 Nosler, as the world’s most powerful 6.5mm cartridge commercially available during SHOT Show in January 2014. In January 2015, Nosler introduced the company’s second cartridge, the 28 Nosler, a 7mm rifle cartridge based on the 26 Nosler case. Since their release, the 26 Nosler and 28 Nosler have been known for high muzzle velocities and extremely flat trajectories. The parent case for both cartridges is based on the .404 Jeffery case.\n\nIn October 2014, Nosler introduced Ballistic Tip Ammunition as the latest product offering in their factory loaded ammunition. The ammunition is loaded exclusively with Nosler’s line of Ballistic Tip hunting bullets, a polymer-tipped projectile made popular by the company when introduced in 1984 as a premium choice for hunting medium-sized game such as deer, antelope and wild hogs. The Ballistic Tip Ammunition line pairs the performance of the Ballistic Tip projectile with Nosler’s own component brass.\n\nLate 2014 Nosler revamped the Model 48 line. It did away with the Trophy Grade Rifle and replaced it with the Patriot Rifle. The new rifle has a Basix trigger and Bell and Carlson stock. For the most accuracy out of the Patriot, Nosler incorporated an aluminum bedding chassis into the aramid-fiber reinforced carbon fiber stock, and the barrel is free-floated. The stock is a hand laid-up laminate that is elephant gray with black epoxy webbed over the surface. Which means it’s never going to warp or crack. The comb is straight with a pancake cheekpiece and a thick, solid pistol grip. The Patriot rifle chambered in .26 Nosler should be an effective hunting combination from the mountains to the prairies.\n\nEarly 2016 Nosler introduced its third cartridge the .30 Nosler.\n\nOctober 2016 Nosler introduces a new line of Competition / Target Bullets - RDF Bullets\n\nOctober 2016 Nosler introduces the .33 Nosler\n\nJanuary 2017 Nosler introduces the .22 Nosler.\n\n2007 NRA Golden Bullseye Pioneer Award: John A.

A short time after a writer for \"The Daily Cardinal\" began quoting Roundy's sports predictions and witticisms uttered in the pool hall, \"The Capital Times\" offered Roundy a writing job. In 1924, he switched employers to the \"Wisconsin State Journal\". Understanding that Roundy would be a major boon for the newspaper, the editors chose to announce his hiring with the entire front page of its second section. He remained with the \"Wisconsin State Journal\" until his retirement at the end of the 1970 college football season.\n\nRoundy often wrote in a stream-of-consciousness style, frequently at the expense of proper grammar.
