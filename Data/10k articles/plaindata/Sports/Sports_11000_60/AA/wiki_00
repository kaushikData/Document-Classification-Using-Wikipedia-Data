The Everett Events Center opened in October 2003. Naming rights were sold to Comcast in 2007, who renamed the arena to Comcast Arena at Everett. In 2014, the name was changed to Xfinity Arena, named after the Xfinity brand that was adopted by the Comcast Cable division. Angel of the Winds Casino Resort, operated by the Stillaguamish Tribe, signed a 10-year, $3.4 million contract to become the arena's new naming rights sponsor in 2017.\n\nThe 10,000-seat venue has hosted a variety of concerts and other types of performances. A few events that have showcased at Angel of the Winds Arena include Ringling Brothers Circus, The Spa, Pool, and Swimspa Show, moto cross, and family shows such as Disney on Ice, Harlem Globetrotters, Sesame Street Live and a myriad of others.\n\nThe venue served as the host for 2008 Skate America, a three-day ice-skating championship featuring world class skaters. The events were both nationally and internationally televised on NBC. It was the first event of six in the 2008-2009 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating, a senior-level international invitational competition. This was Skate America's largest attendance ever recorded in its history.\n\nIn 2016, the arena served as the host for the 2016 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships.\n\nAngel of the Winds Arena is the home of the Everett Silvertips, a Western Hockey League franchise.

The franchise was previously known as the San Jose Stealth, and before that the Albany Attack. The National Lacrosse League announced on June 27, 2013 that the Washington Stealth would relocate for the upcoming season. The team would preserve its nickname in the move. Further details were to be announced at a press conference on July 2, 2013.\n\nAngel of the Winds Arena is also home to the Tilted Thunder Rail Birds, a Seattle-based, all-female, banked track roller derby league. \n\nThe arena was also home to the International Basketball League's Everett Explosion for one season in 2007 before they moved to Monroe and were renamed the Snohomish County Explosion, where they played until 2010.

The arena's primary function is as home to the men's and women's basketball teams for Kansas State University. The building also holds offices for Kansas State Wildcats baseball, Intercollegiate Athletics, and Sports Information.\n\nThe arena is located in the northwest corner of the Kansas State campus, along with the rest of the school's athletic facilities, abutting the south end zone of Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium.\n\nThe arena was built to replace Ahearn Field House, K-State's basketball facility from 1950 to 1988. Construction of Bramlage Coliseum began with a groundbreaking on October 18, 1986, and was completed in 1988. The construction was funded entirely by student fees and donations from alumni and friends of the University.\n\nIt was named for Junction City businessman Fred Bramlage, who played a major role in raising the funds needed to build the arena.\n\nOn November 26, 1988, Kansas State University officially opened Bramlage Coliseum with an 81-77 victory over Purdue University. The first basketball game actually played in the arena, however, was an NBA exhibition game between the Dallas Mavericks, led by former K-State standout Rolando Blackman, and the San Antonio Spurs on October 21, 1988.\n\nAs of February 16, 2016, the Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team has posted a 328-105 (.758) record in Bramlage Coliseum. Since the inception of \"The Octagon of Doom\" title in the 2007-2008 season, the home record is 124-23 (.845).\n\nThe facility hosted women's NCAA basketball tournament games in 2002 and 2003. Kansas State played in Bramlage Coliseum in both tournament years.\n\nBramlage has also been home to the Kansas State High School Activities Association Class 2A boys and girls state championship tournaments since 1990.\n\nThe concourse around the arena is decorated with pictures of Wildcat greats and trophies won by the men's and women's teams over the years. A painted border around the top of the walls inside the Coliseum shows the years the Wildcat basketball programs won conference crowns or participated in the NCAA Tournament or NIT (WNIT). Hanging from the rafters in Bramlage are the retired numbers of former Wildcat greats including: Ernie Barrett, Rolando Blackman, Mitch Richmond, Bob Boozer, Mike Evans, Dick Knostman, Lon Kruger, Jack Parr, Chuckie Williams, Nicole Ohlde, Kendra Wecker and Shalee Lehning.\n\nThe unofficial nickname for Bramlage Coliseum is \"The Octagon of Doom,\" due to the building's eight sides. The nickname was popularized in the media during the 2009-2010 season, but it was first used in on-line internet forums in early 2007. K-State students bring octagonal shaped signs with \"Doom\" written on them and wear \"Doom\" T-shirts to games.\n\nBefore every game, the crowd sings Wildcat Victory, the Kansas State fight song, and then rocks back and forth to the Wabash Cannonball. As the K-State players make their way from the locker room to the court, the crowd chants, \"Bring on the Cats, Bring on the Cats, Bring on the Cats.\" When the Cats hit the floor the crowd erupts and rises to their feet. While the opposing team's starting lineup is announced, the student section shakes newspapers, and after each name chants, \"So What\" \"Who Cares\" \"Who's He?\" \"Big Deal\" \"Go Home,\" and then rips the papers and throws them in the air at the beginning of the introduction of the Kansas State starting lineup. Each time an opposing player commits a foul the student section chants the number of fouls that player has, and every time a K-State player sinks a three-point basket, the announcer says the name of the player followed by \"for\", and then the crowd echoes \"three!\" Following a K-State victory, the crowd performs a \"K-S-U Wildcats\" chant. If an opposing team's player fouls out of the game, the crowd chants \"left, right, left\" for each step. If he stands, they chant \"standing, standing\" until the player sits down, at which time the crowd yells \"Sit down!\"\n\nSeating capacity in Bramlage was originally 13,500. Adjustments for fire codes lowered this number to 13,340 in the 2000s, and construction prior to the 2007-2008 season eliminated another approximately 800 seats to add luxury boxes and bring handicap seating up to compliance. The current capacity is 12,528.\n\n\nIn addition to Kansas State basketball, Bramlage Coliseum also hosts musical and comical performances, speeches, trade shows, and undergraduate commencement ceremonies. The arena has seated up to 14,000 for concerts. It has featured performances by the following groups and individuals:\n\n\nThe arena has also hosted speaking events as part of the Landon Lecture Series by the following personalities:\n\n\n"}

It was first held in 1922 and for every year until 1997. The competition was reinstated in 2016, replacing the FOGS competition under the Queensland cup. The competition consists of Brisbane’s top six rugby league clubs. Each participating team is a feeder club for the Queensland Cup.\n\nPrior to 1922, the competition was conducted under the auspices of the Queensland Rugby League. Until the 1980s it was the premier sporting competition in Brisbane, attracting large crowds and broad media coverage. The Brisbane Rugby League however, had been in slow decline for some 15 years as large numbers of its players left to compete in the more lucrative Sydney Rugby League premiership, and began to lose popular interest with the creation of the Brisbane Broncos in 1988. The Brisbane Rugby League premiership was replaced by the Queensland Cup before the 1998 season. In 2016 the competition was reinstated with the Redcliffe Dolphins winning the competition that year.\n\nThe Queensland Rugby Football League (QRFL) was formed in 1908 by seven former rugby union players who were dissatisfied with the administration of the Queensland Rugby Union (QRU). The new organisation was attacked by both the local press and the QRU for introducing professionalism, which they claimed would destroy the sport. The \"founding fathers\" of the QARFL included John Fihelly, an Australian Labor Party Member of Parliament who became Minister for Railways and Deputy Premier.\n\nThe first official club competition kicked off in Brisbane on 8 May 1909. Norths played against Souths before a handful of spectators at Brisbane Cricket Ground. Matches were played under the auspices of the Queensland Amateur Rugby Football League (later renamed Queensland Rugby League). The foundation clubs were:\n\n\nIn 1922 the Brisbane Rugby Football League (Brisbane Rugby Football League, later Brisbane Rugby League) was formed out of dissatisfaction with the way the Queensland Rugby League ran the game. Those involved took particular exception to the salary being earned by Harry Sunderland as secretary of the Queensland Rugby League. The Brisbane Rugby League took control of the local competition. Competing in the Brisbane Rugby League competition that year were Brothers, Carltons, Coorparoo, University, Valley and Past Grammars. Although the Queensland Rugby League attempted to regain control of the Brisbane Rugby League competition in 1923 and 1924, the Brisbane Rugby League remained steadfast and the dispute simmered into the next decade. so dire did the situation become, that by the late 1920s, the Queensland Rugby League commenced its own competition involving Ipswich clubs and two supporting Brisbane clubs.\n\nUntil 1932 Brisbane Exhibition Ground was the home of rugby league in the city. The complicated arrangement between the Brisbane Rugby League, Queensland Rugby League and Royal National Association (who administered the Exhibition Ground) led to Brisbane Cricket Ground being used for rugby league matches.\n\nIn 1933 district football was introduced to provide community support and player equalisation. This meant that players had to live within a certain distance of their club. Accordingly, Brisbane was divided into Eastern Suburbs (incorporating Coorparoo and Wynnum), Southern Suburbs (incorporating Carltons), Western Suburbs, Northern Suburbs (incorporating Past Grammars), Fortitude Valley and Past Brothers (whose players had to prove that they had attended a Christian Brothers school). In 1934, the University Amateur Rugby League Club folded and disappeared from the competition.\n\nIn 1953 the friction between the Queensland Rugby League and Brisbane Rugby League ended, with the Brisbane Rugby League being replaced by the Brisbane division of the Queensland Rugby League. Former Brisbane Rugby League chairman and Queensland Rugby League secretary Ron McAullife eventually secured the use of Lang Park as a permanent home for rugby league in Queensland. Teams that joined the Brisbane Rugby League competition around this time were South Coast (1952–1953), Wynnum-Manly (1951) and Redcliffe (1960).\n\nA record crowd at Lang Park of 19,824 saw Northern Suburbs defeat Fortitude Valley in the Brisbane Rugby League grand final in September 1961.\n\nIn 1967 the Queensland Rugby League removed the residential qualifications for players in Brisbane Rugby League clubs, meaning that players did not have to reside in their certain suburbs to play for their teams. This reduced community support for teams, and club decisions began to be made on a more commercial basis.\n\nThis coincided with the commencement of television broadcasts of Brisbane Rugby League games in the same year. The money made from jersey sponsorships and advertising hoardings at grounds was not able to compete with poker machine money available to Sydney Rugby League clubs in the Sydney Rugby League, and an increasing number of players left the Brisbane Rugby League. This also affected the popularity of the Bulimba Cup which had been held between the cities of Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba since the 1930s.\n\nThe effect of television coverage on attendances became pronounced by the mid-1970s and crowds began to desert the Brisbane Rugby League competition. Clubs found themselves in financial hardship, and the public began to support the Sydney Rugby League which by then was being broadcast in Queensland. In 1978 the premiership trophy, the Kirks Cup was replaced by the Winfield Cup.\n\nThe Queensland Rugby League commissioned Eric White Associates to investigate the administrative structure of the game in Queensland in 1977. One of the recommendations was the creation of a statewide competition. The Winfield State League was created in 1982. The State League competition ran in parallel to the Brisbane Rugby League competition from 1982 to 1995. Also, like with Sydney's competition, Brisbane's competition was also called the Winfield Cup during the 1980s, due to sponsorship from Winfield cigarettes. The Queensland Cup would eventually replace both the State league and the Brisbane Rugby League premiership in 1998.\n\nIn the 1980s, two further teams were added to the Brisbane Rugby League competition: Ipswich (1986) and Logan (1987).\n\nIn 1986 the New South Wales Rugby League decided to allow a team from Brisbane to enter the Sydney Rugby League premiership. The Brisbane Broncos debuted in the Sydney Rugby League premiership in 1988. As the Broncos began to represent Brisbane at rugby league in the public eye the Brisbane Rugby League competition entered the terminal phase of its decline. Indeed, 1987, the year before the Broncos commenced playing, was the last year that a Brisbane Rugby League player would be selected to play for Queensland in the State of Origin series.\n\nThe Brisbane Rugby League premiership was fully superseded by the Queensland Cup competition in 1998. Redcliffe won the last Brisbane Rugby League Grand Final in 1997 defeating Easts 35–6.\n\nOn September 26, 2014, the South East Queensland Division announced that they will be scrapping the existing FOGS Cup structure and reforming the Brisbane Rugby League as the state's secondary competition.\n\nThe Brisbane Rugby League was also represented by a representative side whose players were selected from Brisbane Rugby League clubs' first grade teams.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44490262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44490262", "title": "Chinese home run", "text": "Chinese home run\n\nIn baseball, a Chinese home run, also a Chinese homer, Harlem home run, or Pekinese poke, is a derogatory and archaic term for a hit that just barely clears the outfield fence at its closest distance to home plate. It is essentially the shortest home run possible in the ballpark in question, particularly if the park has an atypically short fence to begin with. The term was most commonly used in reference to home runs hit along the right field foul line at the Polo Grounds, home of the New York Giants, where that distance was short even by contemporary standards. When the Giants moved to San Francisco in 1958, the Los Angeles Coliseum, temporary home of the newly relocated Los Angeles Dodgers, gained the same reputation for four seasons until the team took up residence in its permanent home at Dodger Stadium in 1962. Following two seasons of use by the expansion New York Mets in the early 1960s, the Polo Grounds were demolished, and the term gradually dropped out of use.\n\nWhy these home runs were called \"Chinese\" is not definitely known, but it is believed to have reflected an early 20th-century perception that Chinese immigrants to the United States did the menial labor they were consigned to with a bare minimum of adequacy, and were content with minimal reward for it. A Tad Dorgan cartoon has been proposed as the likely origin, but that has not been proven; the earliest known use is in a 1927 newspaper account of a Pittsburgh Pirates-Philadelphia Phillies game. In the 1950s, an extended take on the term in the \"New York Daily News\" led the city's Chinese-American community to ask sportswriters not to use it. This perception of ethnic insensitivity has further contributed to its disuse.\n\nIt has been used to disparage not only the hit but the batter, since it implies minimal effort on his part. Giants' outfielder Mel Ott, who hit many such home runs in the Polo Grounds during his career, was a frequent target of this as his physique and unusual batting stance were not those associated with a power hitter. The hit most frequently recalled as a Chinese home run was the three-run pinch hit walk-off shot by Dusty Rhodes that won the first game of the 1954 World Series for the Giants on their way to a sweep of the Cleveland Indians.\n\nA secondary meaning, which continues today, is of a foul ball that travels high and far, often behind home plate. However, this appears to be confined to sandlot and high-school games in New England. Research into this usage suggests that it may not, in fact, have had anything initially to do with Chinese people, but is instead a corruption of \"Chaney's home run\", from a foul by a player of that name which supposedly won a game when the ball thus hit, the only one remaining, could not be found.\n\nAs early as the late 19th century, baseball players and fans had recognized that parks with shorter distances to the foul poles and back fence allowed for home runs that were regarded as undeserved or unearned, since fly balls of the same distance hit closer to or in center field could easily be caught for outs. In 1896 Jim Nolan of the \"Daily News\" of Galveston, Texas, reporting on the expansion of the local ballpark, wrote: \"The enlarged size of the grounds will enable the outfielders to cover more ground and take in fly balls that went for cheap home runs before. Batsmen will have to earn their triples and home runs hereafter\". In 2010 Jonathan E. Lighter, editor of the \"Historical Dictionary of American Slang\", posted on the American Dialect Society's (ADS) listserv that he had found the earliest use of the term \"Chinese home run\" for that type of hit in a Charleroi, Pennsylvania, newspaper's 1927 account of a Philadelphia Phillies game against the Pittsburgh Pirates: \"The Phillies went into a deadlock on Cy's Chinese homer only to see the Buccos hammer over four runs a little later.\"\n\nThis predates by three years the earliest use that Paul Dickson found when researching \"The Dickson Baseball Dictionary\". In a 1930 \"Washington Post\" story, writer Brian Bell quoted Dan Howley, manager of the Cincinnati Reds, defending the hitting prowess of Harry Heilmann, who was then finishing his career under Howley. \"[They] were real home runs\", Howley said, pointing out how far from the field they had landed. \"They were not Chinese home runs in that short bleacher at right\", referring to the back fence on the foul line at the Polo Grounds, a mere from home.\n\nDickson reiterated the results of two attempts in the 1950s to determine the term's origin, following its widespread use in stories. After Rhodes' home run, Joseph Sheehan of \"The New York Times\" made the first attempt. His research took him to Garry Schumacher, a former baseball writer then working as the Giants' press relations executive, who had himself been known for creating some baseball terms that went into wide use. Schumacher told him that he believed Tad Dorgan, a cartoonist popular in the early decades of the 20th century, had introduced it, probably in one of his widely read \"Indoor Sports\" panels. It has, however, been suggested that Dorgan disliked the Giants and their manager, John McGraw, which may have also given him a reason to coin a disparaging term for short home runs (however, Lighter said in a followup post to the ADS listserv that he had found no evidence Dorgan coined the term, or even that the cartoonist had heard it).\n\nDuring the 1910s, when Dorgan's cartoon was at its most popular, there was an ongoing debate over the Chinese Exclusion Act, the first immigration law in U.S. history to bar entry to the country on the basis of ethnicity or national origin. Chinese immigrants who had entered prior to its 1882 passage remained, however, and were often hired as \"coolies\", doing menial labor for low pay. \"The idea was to express a cheap home run as Chinese then represented what was cheap, such as their labor\", lexicographer David Shulman told Dickson. This was in keeping with a bevy of other contemporary such usages, such as calling a Ford automobile a \"Chinese Rolls-Royce\". Sheehan also wrote that it carried the additional \"connotation of a homer of little account.\" He did not think that Dorgan, known for the gentleness of his satire, had meant it to be insulting, especially since he had two adopted sons from China.\n\nIn 1958, when the Giants moved to San Francisco and left the Polo Grounds, J. G. Taylor Spink, publisher of \"The Sporting News\", made another attempt to find the source of the term. He agreed with Sheehan that it had originated with Dorgan and the association of Chinese immigrants with cheap labor. However, his article was reprinted in the \"Los Angeles Times\", and readers there wrote in with alternative suggestions.\n\nOne was from Travis McGregor, a retired San Francisco sportswriter. In his recollection, the term had been in use on the West Coast in the years just before World War I. He attributed it to a joke derived from an aspiring Chinese-American sportswriter covering minor league games in the Pacific Coast League, whom the typists at newspapers simply credited as \"Mike Murphy\" since they couldn't properly transcribe his name. \"He had a keen sense of humor, a degree from Stanford and a great yen to be a newspaperman\", McGregor wrote in his own letter to \"The Sporting News\". As a result of his education, he spoke with no accent, but still used affected syntax. \"He was a one-man show at baseball games ... for two or three seasons, an Oriental Fred Allen\", according to McGregor. Once, he recalled, Murphy described one batter as \"wave at ball like Mandarin with fan\".\n\nThis phrase stuck in the minds of the other sportswriters in attendance and, McGregor suggested, it spread among all the league's writers, becoming a catch phrase. \"The old Oakland park's short fence caught the most of it from Mike, and his 'Mandarin fan' waving balls out of the park were knocked back to 'Chinese homers'\", said McGregor. A number of Murphy's comments were adapted into cartoons by Dorgan, a native of San Francisco, and from there the term migrated into print. McGregor believed that either Ed Hughes or Harry Smith of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" were the first to do so, and better-known writers like Ring Lardner and Damon Runyon may have picked it up from them and popularized it nationwide.\n\nSportswriters extended the idea. Shulman wrote in 1930 of hearing them talk about short pop flies as \"Chinese line drives\". Texas leaguers, or high bloop singles that fell between the infielders and outfielders, were likewise called \"Japanese line drives\" when hit in Pacific Coast League games.\n\nThere have been other theories to explain how home runs that barely cleared the fence came to be called \"Chinese\". Dan Schlossberg, a veteran Associated Press baseball writer, accepts the Dorgan story but also reports that Bill McGeehan, then sports editor of the \"New York Tribune\", had in 1920 likened the right field fence at the Polo Grounds to the Great Wall of China: \"thick, low, and not very formidable\", suggesting that that may also have had something to do with the term's coinage. Russ Hodges, who called Giants games on the radio in both New York and San Francisco, told the latter city's \"Call-Bulletin\" in 1958 that the term came into use from the supposed tendency of Chinese gamblers watching games at the Polo Grounds in the early 20th century to cluster in seats next to the left field foul pole. \"Any hit that went out at that point\", he explained, \"was followed by cries of 'There goes one for the Chinese'\".\n\nAnother \"Sporting News\" columnist, Joe Falls, devoted a column to the term and solicited theories of its origin from readers. Some suggested that it had something to do with the \"short jump\" in Chinese checkers, or that since Chinese people were generally short, that short home runs would be named after them. Another reader claimed that the term arose because the outfield seats in the Polo Grounds supposedly stuck out in ways that suggested a pagoda.\n\nThe term appears to have caught on quickly in baseball throughout the 1920s. By the 1950s, it was still in use but its connotations were no longer clear, and its use after one notoriously short home run that won a World Series game sparked a protest. After the 1964 demolition of the Polo Grounds, with its notoriously short right field fence, the term largely fell from use.\n\nAfter establishing itself in baseball's argot, \"Chinese home run\" continued to be used, even while most of the other derogatory terms related to the Chinese fell from use; the American public opinion began to see the Chinese people in a more sympathetic light due to China's struggles against Japanese domination during the 1930s, struggles that led to the U.S. and China becoming allies during World War II. Within baseball it was frequently associated with the Giants and the Polo Grounds, with its short right-field fence. One Giant in particular, outfielder Mel Ott, was sometimes described as the master of the Chinese home run, since he hit many of his 511 career home runs (a National League record at the time of his retirement) to right field in the team's home stadium (although often to the upper deck) during his 1926–45 playing career.\n\nThe association likely developed because not only did Ott not have the physique commonly associated with power hitters, he used an unusual batting technique. The outfielder preceded his swings by dropping his hands, lifting his front leg and stepping forward on it as the pitch came. Since that defied accepted baseball wisdom about how to hit home runs, it was assumed that Ott was focusing on the short right field fence, and sportswriters often kidded him about this. Ott, who worked on his technique extensively, usually responded that if it was so easy, other batters in the league should have been able to hit even more of those home runs when visiting the Giants. It has also been pointed out that Ott's best-known home run, which won his team the 1933 World Series from the Washington Senators, was hit in Griffith Stadium, not the Polo Grounds, and over a longer fence.\n\nWhile Bobby Thomson's 1951 pennant-clinching \"Shot Heard 'Round The World\" has sometimes been described as a Chinese home run, the best-known such hit by a Giant in the Polo Grounds also won an extra-inning World Series game, and may have proved decisive in eventually winning that series for the Giants. In the 10th inning of Game 1 of the 1954 World Series against the heavily favored Cleveland Indians, Giants' manager Leo Durocher, on a hunch, sent in Dusty Rhodes to pinch hit for Monte Irvin. The left-handed Rhodes hit a walk-off home run just over the right field fence, giving the Giants the three runs they needed to win the game.\n\nThe extensive media coverage led to discussions of both the term, such as Sheehan's in the \"Times\", and Chinese home runs themselves. Since the late 1940s, there had been complaints from older fans that they were part of the decline of the game. \"Ballplayers played ball in those days\", said a writer in a 1948 column in the Lowell, Massachusetts, \"Sun\". \"Now they pop a Chinese home run into an overhanging balcony and the crowd thinks it's wonderful\". Two years later, Richard Maney included the Chinese home run among the failings of the postwar game in a \"Times\" piece.\n\nThat 1954 game is chiefly remembered today for Willie Mays' catch of a Vic Wertz fly to deep center in the eighth inning, which broke up an Indians' rally that might otherwise have led to them winning the game. It had happened because of the distance of the Polo Grounds' fences in that area, its other peculiarity, which offset the advantage to hitters of its short right-field fence. The Indians attributed their upset loss to the park's unusual dimensions. \"The longest out and the shortest home run of the season beat us, that's all\", Indians manager Al López told the \"Washington Post\". The team was unable to recover psychologically, and the Giants swept them three games later.\n\nSportswriters made much humor of the \"Chinese\" aspect of Rhodes' home run. One newspaper's photographer posed him reading a Chinese newspaper, apparently looking for an account of his hit. The \"New York Times\" called it \"more Chinese than chow mein and just as Chinese as Shanghai and Peiping\".\n\nDick Young extended this trope the furthest in his \"Daily News\" coverage:\nThis unrestrained use of Chinese stereotypes, both in content and phrasing, drew a protest. Shavey Lee, long considered the unofficial \"mayor\" of New York's Chinatown, collected signatures on a petition (in Chinese) from himself and other members of the city's Chinese American community, demanding not just Young but \"all\" sportswriters stop using the term, and presented it to the Giants' secretary Eddie Brannick. \"It isn't the fault of the Chinese if you have a 258-foot fence\", he wrote. \"Why should we be blamed all the time? What makes a cheesy home run a Chinese home run?\"\n\nAfter Brannick posted it on the wall of the team's press room, Lee's petition earned him congratulatory letters from Chinese Americans all over the country, and became national news, earning time on the television series \"What's the Story\". Jack Orr, a \"Sporting News\" writer, went to Lee's restaurant and told him he was right to object. \"Writers shouldn't be using that term\", he said. \"But what took you so long to get around to protesting?\" Two years later, another New York sportswriter, Jimmy Cannon, noted when defining \"Chinese home run\" in a glossary of baseball terms he wrote for \"Baseball Digest\" that it \"would probably be called something else if the Chinese had more influence\".\n\nThe Giants moved from the Polo Grounds to San Francisco at the end of the 1957 season. Chinese home runs were once again a subject of discussion, with many writers recalling short shots like Thomson's and Rhodes' as a quirk of the former stadium now lost to baseball. Writing in \"The New York Times\" as spring training was underway, Gay Talese wrote that Giants' players in their new home missed the \"cheap (or Chinese) home runs ... legal nonetheless\".\n\nAnother park quickly took over the Polo Grounds' reputation for Chinese home runs. New York City's other National League team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, had also moved to the West Coast for the 1958 season, where they played their first home games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Built for the 1932 Olympics, it had mainly been used for football since then. Its field was well-suited for that sport and the track and field events it had been designed for, but putting a baseball diamond in it was awkward. The left field pole was just from the plate, even shorter than right had been at the Polo Grounds, and it was much more likely that balls would be hit there due to the majority of batters being right-handed. Before the regular season even began, players from other teams were complaining about it.\n\nGiants' pitcher Johnny Antonelli called it a \"farce\". Warren Spahn, ace for the defending World Series champion Milwaukee Braves, suggested that a rule be established requiring that all fences be at least 300 feet (91 m) from the plate. Owner Walter O'Malley ordered that a wire mesh screen be put up behind the left field fence. \"We don't want to acquire a reputation for Chinese home runs\", he said. Sports media, particularly back in New York, charged that O'Malley was destroying the game for the sake of ticket sales. \"Sports Illustrated\" titled a critical editorial \"Every Sixth Hit a Homer!\", expressing concern that Babe Ruth's record of 60 home runs during a season might easily fall to a less worthy hitter in the coming season due to the Dodgers' short fence. An Associated Press (AP) poll of baseball writers found that a majority believed that any home run records set mainly in the Coliseum should carry an asterisk.\n\nAs had happened with Rhodes' home run four years earlier, the Chinese-themed joking around the short fence continued. The screen was called the \"Chinese screen\" or the \"Great Wall of China\", and the Coliseum as a whole became known as \"O'Malley's Chinese Theatre\", \"The House that Charlie Chan Built\", or even, in one Willard Mullin cartoon, \"Flung Wong O'Malley's Little Joss House in Los Angeles\". \"The Sporting News\", contrary to the preseason trend, editorialized that it could not yet be said that the short wall would adversely affect the game. But on the cover of that issue (which also included Spink's etymological investigation) it put a cartoon showing an outsized Chinese coolie hanging over the Coliseum's back fence. The Chinese American community in the Los Angeles area made its objections known.\n\nAt first the worst fears of the media appeared justified. In the first week of play at the Coliseum, 24 home runs were hit, most of them over the left field fence and screen. Chicago Cubs outfielder Lee Walls, not especially distinguished as a hitter, was responsible for three of them—in a single game. Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick, who had defended the Coliseum's dimensions during the preseason, quickly proposed that a second, mesh screen be established in the stands at from the plate, with any balls that fell between the two a ground rule double; however, that turned to be impossible under earthquake-safety provisions of the Los Angeles building code.\n\nPitchers soon adjusted. They threw outside to right-handed hitters, requiring them to pull hard for the left-field fence, and as at the Polo Grounds, a deep fence in right center () challenged lefties, and over the course of the season the home run count at the Coliseum declined to the same level as other National League parks. At the end of the season, \"The Sporting News\" noted, there had been only 21 more home runs in the Coliseum than there were in the smaller Ebbets Field, where the Dodgers had played in Brooklyn. During the off-season, Frick announced a rule change stipulating that any new stadium built for major-league play must have all its fences at least from home plate, as Spahn had suggested. This was widely viewed as a response to the preseason controversy.\nThe only hitter to truly benefit from the short left-field fence was Wally Moon, a left-handed outfielder who began playing for the Dodgers the next season. He figured out how to lift balls high enough so that they dropped down, almost vertically, just beyond the screen. This brought him 37 of his 49 homers for that season. He was not accused of exploiting the short distance to the fence for Chinese home runs. Instead, he was celebrated for his inventiveness; similar home runs have since been called \"Moon shots\" in his honor.\n\nGame 5 of that year's World Series, ultimately won by the Dodgers over the Chicago White Sox, would be the last postseason Major League Baseball game played at the Coliseum. After two more seasons at the Coliseum, the Dodgers moved to Dodger Stadium in 1962, where they have played home games since. After the then–Los Angeles Angels' first American League season in 1961, the club asked for a new home in the Los Angeles area, initially asking if they could play in the Coliseum. Frick refused.\n\nIn 2008, to celebrate their 50th anniversary in Los Angeles, the Dodgers played a preseason exhibition game at the Coliseum against the Boston Red Sox, losing by a score of 7–1. The wire mesh screen was restored, this time at the height Frick had sought because an additional section of seats had been added there since 1959, shortening left field to . A Dodgers executive noted that it mimicked the Green Monster in left field at Fenway Park, the Red Sox' home field.\n\nIn 1962, baseball returned to the Polo Grounds when the National League created the New York Mets as an expansion team, to replace the Giants and Dodgers. The new team used the old stadium for two seasons while Shea Stadium was built out in the Queens neighborhood of Flushing. The Mets lost the franchise's first six games at the Giants' former home, on their way to a 40–120 record, still the most losses in a major-league season, but in those games they and their opponents hit ten home runs apiece. Sportswriters took notice, and one AP writer picked up where Dick Young had left off eight years before: \"So solly, honorable sir. Chinese home run not buried in Coliseum. Making big comeback in honorable ancient Polo Grounds\".\n\nWhile the team's poor play and last-place finishes in its two seasons in the Polo Grounds left few individual home runs over the right-field fence to become the subject of popular comment and mockery as Rhodes' had, the term was still in use during the team's radio broadcasts, as Yale professor Dana Brand recalled in his 2007 memoir, \"Mets Fan\":\nProblems in completing Shea Stadium forced the Mets to stay one season more. At one point during the season, manager Casey Stengel alluded to the short home runs when berating pitcher Tracy Stallard. \"At the end of this season they're gonna tear this place down\", he reminded Stallard as he took him out of a game in which he had given up several home runs. \"The way you're pitching, that right field section is gone already\". In April 1964, the Polo Grounds were demolished and replaced with a public housing project.\n\nUse of the term largely faded out afterwards, and it was seen as offensive. In 1981 \"San Francisco Chronicle\" columnist Herb Caen criticized Oakland A's radio announcer Bill King for saying a Bobby Murcer shot was \"not a Chinese home run\". Caen called the remark \"racist\" and wrote: \"I'm sure he has heard from militant Oriental groups, all of which hit hard\".\n\nDickson found another usage, referring to a high foul ball that travels a great distance, usually behind home plate. In Stephen King's 1980 short story \"The Monkey\", anthologized five years later in \"Skeleton Crew\", the protagonists' father recalls days watching sandlot games during his own childhood, when he \"was too small to play, but he sat far out in foul territory sucking his blueberry Popsicle and chasing what the big kids called 'Chinese home runs'\". Dickson wrote to King, who told him two years later that he had first heard the term when learning to play baseball in his own childhood, during a time when he lived, briefly, in Stratford, Connecticut. After he returned to his native Maine in 1958, the same year the Giants and Dodgers moved west, he recalled hearing it again. \"In both cases\", he told Dickson, \"a Chinese home run was a foul ball, usually over the backstop\". Dickson concluded from his correspondence that that use may well be limited to New England. All three definitions submitted to the online Urban Dictionary in the early 21st century are in accord with this usage.\n\nAccording to Dickson, one of the etymologies submitted to Joe Falls' \"Sporting News\" column, by a St. Louis man named Tom Becket, may explain this usage. \"In this version, the term harks back to the turn of the 20th century and a game played in Salem, Massachusetts, between teams of Irish and Polish immigrants\". The game was close, and went deep into extra innings. By the 17th inning, only one ball was left. A shortstop named Chaney, playing for the Irish team, fouled the ball deep into unmowed grass and weeds behind the backstop. After searching through it for 20 minutes, the umpire gave up and declared that the Polish team had forfeited the game since it had failed to provide enough balls. \"So the cheer went up, 'Chaney's home run won the game!'\", Becket explained. \"Various misunderstandings as to dialects eventually brought it around to the now-familiar 'Chinese home run'\".\n\n"}

The site has been transformed into a zoological park, the \"Donjon des Aigles\" (eagles' keep), where one may admire birds of prey in flight around the ruins of the castle, with a view over the vallée des Gaves.\n\nConstruction of the castle began in 1037. Altered and expanded several times, it was the property of the Viscounts of Castet-Loubon commonly known as the Viscounts of Lavedan. It was the normal residence of the viscountcy, the most powerful in Bigorre with vast possessions including seventeen towns in the Barèges valley, They owned it for several centuries, but from the 15th century, they rarely stayed there, using it only when conducting business in the area.\n\nIn 1560, in events leading up to the French Wars of Religion, the Viscount, as a Huguenot, saw his castle pillaged by Catholic forces.\n\nThe castle was inhabited in 1643, when it belonged then to \n\nMadame de Motteville stayed at the castle for the wedding of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa of Spain, on 9 June 1660 at the in Saint-Jean-de-Luz.

He was extremely unpopular with the population of Bigorre.In 1792, during the French Revolution, he fled to Austria leaving behind his wife - she asked for and received a divorce - and his papers. When the castle was set on fire, they were lost. The Princess managed to keep some of the property, including the castle: in 1802 she sold all of the possessions in Bigorre. The castle then belonged to a succession of owners.\n\nAn earthquake in 1854 caused part of the \"enceinte\" to collapse.\nIn 1856, the castle became the property of Achille Marcus Fould (1800 - 1867), the famous banker and politician. He was Minister of Finance during the Second Republic under Napoleon III and Minister of State from 1852 to 1860 during the Second Empire of Napoleon III. The castle was restored by Fould but remained a ruin overgrown by vegetation.\n\nIt was inscribed on the list of \"monuments historiques\" in 1927.\n\nIn the Bigorre region, legend tells of a long siege of the castle by Charlemagne which ended because an eagle with a trout in its beak led the besiegers to believe that the castle had abundant fresh food.\n\nAt the foot of the castle is a cold sulfurous spring which was drunk by the inhabitants of Beaucens and a lead mine in the rock on which the castle stands.\n\nSince 1973, the castle has housed one of the world's most important collections of birds of prey: : kites, vulture, eagles, sea eagles, falcons and buzzards. Displays are given featuring an Egyptian vulture, who breaks an imitation ostrich egg with a stone, as well as a condor, various owls, parakeets and parrots.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20025890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20025890", "title": "European Tournament for Dancing Students", "text": "European Tournament for Dancing Students\n\nThe European Tournament for Dancing Students or ETDS is a recurring tournament for ballroom and Latin-American dancing for students from Europe.\n\nThe tournament is held twice a year, once during the Pentecost weekend and once in autumn. The event always starts on a Friday evening and ends on the following Monday morning. Although each ETDS is organised by a different party, the structure remains fairly constant: on Friday evening, the blind date program takes place, in which dancers without a partner can try to find someone with which to compete in one or both dance disciplines. Blind dating is also a motivation for some dancers that want to meet new people. On Saturday, the ballroom tournament for the \"breitensport\" class (German, meaning amateur sports for the masses) takes place and the Latin-American tournament for the open class as well as, if so chosen by the organising party, for the CloseD class. On Sunday, all classes dance the respective other discipline. The event ends on Monday with a last common breakfast.\n\nThe organisation of each tournament is in the hands of a different participating university. The tournament takes place in the city of the organising university, the location changing every half year to another European city. So far, the tournament has taken place most of the times either in Germany or the Netherlands. In autumn 2015, the ETDS took place in Czech Republic, breaking that series for the first time. With the participation of some students from South Africa, it also premiered hosting dancers from outside Europe.\n\nAlthough the primary focus of the ETDS lies in organising a tournament of high standards, the event equally aims at creating a social happening where dancers from all of Europe can meet each other. This is encouraged by the possibility to blind date and by a themed festival (\"motto party\") on the event's Saturday evening and a gala ball on Sunday evening.\n\nThe sleeping accommodation is commonly a local gym.\n\nThe ETDS was founded by the university dance teams of Clausthal, Braunschweig and Kiel, who agreed to get to know each other during a tournament. The event was organised by these three German universities for a number of times. There was not a regular structure, but the tournament was organised ad hoc. Finding a sleeping accommodation was easy, as the number of participants was still very low.\n\nIn November 1990, a tournament price was introduced that has been used ever since, “der tanzmaus” (German for “the dance mouse”), a pluche mouse. The tanzmaus was a donation of the university of Kiel; Clausthal was the first university to win the mouse. It is given to the winning university which \"hosts\" the price until the next ETDS.\n\nIn December 1991, a tournament during Sinterklaas took place. The tournament gained more participants and Berlin started participating as well. Berlin won the dance mouse during this Sinterklaas tournament, and promised to organise the event somewhere in the future. During this tournament, only one class existed. \n\nIn April 1992, the tournament took place in Clausthal. This was the first tournament in which the team of Dortmund started participating. Some tournaments later, Ulm and Marburg started participating as well.\n\nThe University of Berlin fulfilled their promise in 1993 by taking care of the organisation of the tournament. The tournament still did not have separate classes.\n\nThe next tournament took place in the spring of 1994, and the tournament gained in popularity; fifteen universities from Germany participated. Also, for the first time, universities from the Netherlands started to participate. The new universities were from Mainz, Geisenheim, Kaiserslautern, Delft and Eindhoven.\n\nDuring autumn of 1994, the number of participants had increased to such a high amount that problems started to arise between the organisation and the administration of Kiel. The result was that Kiel was disallowed to organise the event for five years.\n\nThe next tournament took place in the spring of 1995, and for the first time, the tournament was separated into two classes. They were called “amateurs” and “profis” (\"professionals\"). Leipzig also joined this tournament.\n\nThe tournament that was held in the summer of 1995 was the first event to take place in the Netherlands. The organisation was in the hands of ESDV Footloose from Eindhoven. Groningen joined during this tournament. From now on, the ETDS was no longer organised on an ad hoc basis, but was organised regularly twice each year, during Pentecost and in the autumn, each time by a different university.\n\nThe number of participants continued to grow, and around 2004 a third class, \"masters\", was added to the breitensport section. More than 500 participants took part in the 41st tournament in Groningen in May 2009, and another breitensport class by the name of “champions” was introduced.\n\nThe event continued to grow in popularity, and 570 participants were competing in the 47th edition during Pentecost, May 2012. In October 2015, the event was held for the first time in the Czech Republic, in the city of Brno. This was the first ETDS not organised in Germany or the Netherlands.\n\nEvery ETDS organisation is allowed to make their own rules for the tournament. Each organisation describes rules about clothing and the calculation of the tanzmaus evaluation. Because the focus of each organization may be different, the balance between social orientation and competition changes slightly. Nevertheless, several rules exist during each tournament:\n\nDancers can sign up for two disciplines, standard and Latin-American.\n\nIn the breitensport class, only untrained and low level training dancers are allowed. Professional dancers, i.e. those who have reached a higher class in official tournaments held by dance associations, are excluded from the breitensport tournaments. They instead dance in the open class which ranges at least from B to S class dancers.\n\nSome hosting universities decide to provide another separate tournament for a class called CloseD, which consists of dancers of the official D and C classes (varying between national dance associations). In case a separate tournament for this class is chosen not to be held, the organising team will classify the concerning dancers into either breitensport (D class) or open class (C class).\n\nParticipants that belong to a dance formation may also be required to dance in the CloseD or open class, depending on the league in which their formation is classified.\n\nIn the breitensport section, a pre-qualification round takes place, where each participating couple is classified into the amateur, professional (\"profi\"), master or the optional champion class, so that each couple will dance the subsequent actual tournament in a class that matches their levels. These tournaments follow the rules of official dancing tournaments. During the finals, open adjudication is sometimes performed, with each adjudicator showing their ranking of the couples on the floor immediately after each dance. However, closed adjudication is often chosen in order to save time. There are winner's certificates and medals for all participants in the finals as well as trophies (instead of medals) for the podium finishers.\n\nIn the respective disciplines, the following dances have to be performed (example rule set):\nThe ETDS has also seen separate competitions without class separation in Discofox, Salsa and Polka.\n\nThe adjudicators are chosen from volunteers of the participating universities that do not compete themselves in the discipline in which they judge. Adjudicators are selected by their adjudicator's license, by their experience and/or by their level of dancing in regular dance competitions.\n\nA blind date couple consists of two dancers from different universities. Blind dating is mandatory in the CloseD and open classes (in the latter case sometimes being replaced by composing couples by the lot or by other rules), and stimulated in the breitensport by a blind date programme on Friday and Saturday for the following day's tournament. During the breitensport tournaments, a blind date couple can score more points for a university, and thereby improve their team's chance of winning the tanzmaus prize.\n\nEvery member of a student dancing society or university student can participate. Each couple dances under the flag of his or her university or dance society. Staff members of the university or dancing society are also allowed to participate. When universities have too few participants to compete for the tanzmaus, they can team up with other universities to improve their chances.\n\nEvery European university or student dance society can participate. In practice, a majority of the participants is German. The second largest participating party is from the Netherlands, and some dancers from the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Estonia, Norway and other neighbouring countries participate as well.\n\nFrom Germany, universities from the following cities have been participating in the ETDS:\n\nIn the Netherlands, the participants often dance under the flag of a dancing society, unlike in Germany, where participants dance under the flag of their university. From the Netherlands, the following cities have been participating in the ETDS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Taking Guangzhou's nickname, the \"Flower City\", the American architectural firm of Ellerbe Becket designed Guangdong Olympic Stadium's sunscreen roof to resemble layers of petals on a flower. The design firm stated in its press release: \"The stadium bowl grows out of the ground to a sculpted upper edge, like the petals of a flower. Floating above the bowl is a shimmering ribbon of roof flowing like a wave over the seats. It parts at the ends and holds the Olympic flame, suspended between the two ribbons. A hotel surrounds a circular opening in the roof that forms a vertical tower of light, which at night is visible for a great distance.\" The stadium's multi-colored seats are positioned in multiple sections that are visually connected via a ribbon pattern.\n\n\n"}

As the country's highest award for the sport, it bears Jesse Owens' name in recognition of his significant career, which included four gold medals at the 1936 Olympic Games. First awarded in 1981 to hurdler Edwin Moses, it was created to recognize the season's top American performer in track and field competitions. In 1996, the award was divided into two categories, with both a male and female winner. The 1996 winners, Michael Johnson and Gail Devers, each won two gold medals at that year's Olympics in Atlanta. Up to 2008, the award was voted on by members of the United States athletics media only, but in 2009 fans were able to vote via the USA Track and Field website, with their opinions contributing 10% of the overall result.\n\nThe winners of the award are typically announced in late November or early December after the end of the outdoor track and field season. A number of athletes have received the award on more than one occasion: Jackie Joyner-Kersee was the first to do so with back-to-back wins in 1986 and 1987, while Carl Lewis won his second award in 1991. Michael Johnson was the first to receive the award three times (winning consecutively from 1994–1996) and Marion Jones became the first woman to collect three awards after wins in 1997, 1998 and 2002. In 2012, Allyson Felix won the award for the fourth time, thus distinguishing herself as the athlete with the most wins. 2014 winners are Mebrahtom Keflezighi and Jennifer Simpson. Winners receive a replica of the award while the original remains on permanent display at the USATF Headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nAs of 2013, the female version of the award was renamed the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Athlete of the Year Award.\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n"}

{"id": "50094445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50094445", "title": "Rhone Apparel", "text": "Rhone Apparel\n\nRhone Apparel (referred to simply as Rhone) is an American startup company producing and selling men's sportswear (activewear). Its product line is intended for high-income, active men between 25 and 50 years of age, who look for activewear that is functional and attractive. The company uses premium custom fabrics, which include silver thread that provides permanent antibacterial and anti-odorant protection.\n\nAll of Rhone's products are designed in Connecticut, with a warehouse in Utah. Rhone has been called \"2016's hottest men's activewear brand.\"\n\nRhone was founded in New Canaan, Connecticut, in 2014 by Nate Checketts, an ex-NFL employee, Kyle McClure, a former NCAA lacrosse player, and two other founders. The company's name comes from the river and region in Europe. The founders were inspired by the fact that the Rhône is not only aesthetically beautiful, but was also highly functional for the surrounding civilizations.\n\nThe company launched as a web-only retailer, but partnered with Bloomingdale's in November 2014 to sell in five locations. In 2015, it entered 127 retail storefronts, selling at such retailers as Nordstrom, Equinox and CorePower Yoga. Rhone launched its first pop-up store in New York City.\n\nRhone experienced sharp growth in 2015. In the month of November, it earned 62% of its 2014 revenue. Its website traffic rose by 350% from 2014 to 2015. Wholesale became the primary driver of the company's 500% growth over the year before that.\n\nThe company announced the closing of a $5 million Series A financing in September 2015. The investors came from sports, media and fashion circles, including Steve Bornstein, David Stern, Ryen Russillo, and Shane Battier. Since its launch, Rhone has raised a total of $6.2 million.\n\nIn February 2016, Rhone organized the purchase of a building from 1892 in Stamford to convert it to a new headquarters. At the time, about 65% of its business was online.\n\nRhone is targeting sophisticated, high-income, active men that look for activewear that is both functional and attractive. Its targeted demographic is between 25 and 50 years of age. Its buyers are diverse, including a unit that defuses bombs in Afghanistan as well as marathon winners. The fitness clothes can also be used for day-to-day activities.\n\nThe company's product line aims to separate the brand from competitors like Lululemon, Nike and Under Armour, whose premium men's offerings are more generic and less available. The company uses superior materials in order to create clothes that last longer than the average product. While the average mass brands spend between $2 and $4 a yard for fabrics, some of Rhone's fabrics cost $15 per yard. \n\nWhen the company founders began researching antimicrobial fabrics, they found that weaving silver into cloth created permanent antibacterial and anti-odorant protection, unlike typical anti-odorant treatments which last for 15 to 20 washes. SilverTech is the brand name of the silver thread that is woven into the company's fabrics. In fact, silver has been used as an antiseptic since Hippocrates. The kind of silver threading Rhone uses was initially developed by the American military for soldiers in Iraq. When it launched, Rhone got numerous orders from army bases, as captains were ordering the gear for troops to wear during training.\n\nClothing details include strategically placed breathable mesh venting panels; silicone gel on the drawstring; a media pocket; and a thick, tall and padded waistband on the shorts. The clothes have stitched-in inspirational messages, such as \"Don't Die Without a Few Scars\" or \"What We Do in Life Echoes in Eternity.\" Flatlock stitching, where the seams lie flat with edges of fabric butting together rather than folding together, is used to avoid chafing. The Polartec Power Dry patented construction creates a fabric that is quick wicking to improve breathability and performance. The clothes have a combination of open and zippered pockets. The fit is a medium between XXL and compression.\n\nOther apparel includes the Rhone Flask, which keeps drinks cold for 24 hours and hot for 12 hours.\n\nRhone's style names come from masculine icons, like the Durden T-shirt after \"Fight Club\" character Tyler Durden, or the Mako short after the shark from \"The Old Man and the Sea\".\n"}

While a bandy rink is about the same size as a football pitch, rink bandy is played on ice hockey rinks.\n\nRink bandy originated in Sweden in the 1960s and was originally called hockeybockey. With the arrival of indoor ice hockey arenas, it was a way for bandy players to practice on ice a longer time of the year; as bandy fields are larger, they were still only made outdoors in the wintertime when artificial freezing was not necessary.\n\nThe game uses a bandy ball and bandy sticks. The goalkeeper has no stick. As in hockey, a game lasts 60 minutes, but is composed of either two 30 minute halves or three 20 minute periods. Similar rules to normal bandy are used, but they are simplified to increase the pace of the game. Checking is prohibited, making the sport relatively safer than its relatives. Because of the smaller playing area, there are fewer players, normally six a side. In the USA Rink Bandy League, five players are used because of the smaller ice hockey rinks there.\n\nRink bandy is governed by the Federation of International Bandy. In its quest to have bandy accepted into the programme of the Winter Olympics, rink bandy is an important way for the Federation of International Bandy to gain more members, thus also spreading bandy, since many countries, which lack a full-size field and where the game is still new, only play rink bandy at home but still participate in the Bandy World Championship. \n\nAs artificially frozen and indoor bandy arenas have become more prevalent, the interest for rink bandy has dwindled in the main bandy-playing nations (Russia, Sweden, Finland, Norway). There are still several rink bandy tournaments in Russia, including the Patriarch Cup () for children at Moscow's Red Square.\n\nA world cup for rink bandy clubs was held every year from 1984-1998 in Hofors, Sweden, and called Hofors World Cup. Rink bandy was included in the programme of the 2012 European Company Sports Games and a European championship existed, though there is currently no top-level international competition. However, in 2017 the Federation of International Bandy decided to hold an international tournament for developing bandy countries in Nymburk, Czech Republic and an international rink bandy club competition called Dniprobandy has been organised by the Ukrainian Bandy and Rink bandy Federation. In Germany, the national bandy championship is played under rink bandy rules.\n\nIn the 1970s rinkball, which is played by more ice hockey-like sticks, grew from being played in local tournaments by villagers around Finland to national-level competitions involving 100 teams or more. The sport first gained international attention in 1984 when teams from Finland and Sweden hosted one another. The International Rinkball Association was formed soon after, and in the late 1990s included Russia, Sweden, Kazakhstan, Estonia, Switzerland, Hungary, Finland and the United States. The Finnish Rinkball Federation has 1000 teams, including women, men and children. Play is divided into eight male divisions, two female divisions, and children's play is divided by age. The first World Championship Games for men was held in Omsk, Russia, in 1998.\n\nThe Rinkball League in Finland publishes a magazine called \"Liiga Extra\", which offers international coverage of tournaments, equipment, and tips. In Finland, leagues and a national championship is held annually (as of 2016).\n"}
