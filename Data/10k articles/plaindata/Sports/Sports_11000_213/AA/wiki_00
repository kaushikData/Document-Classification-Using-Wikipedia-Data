There are three types of routines; a 'balance' routine where the focus is on strength, poise and flexibility; a 'dynamic' routine which includes throws, somersaults and catches, and (at FIG level 6 and above) a 'combined' routine which includes elements from both balance and dynamic.\n\nThe sport is governed by the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG). At international level, there are four FIG categories of competition defined by age; 11-16, 12-18, 13-19, and 15+ (Senior).\n\nAcrobatic gymnasts perform in pairs or groups and enter into and are judged at a specific level or age group category. In each partnership, the gymnasts' different sizes and abilities will be balanced to complement each other in order to carry out the complex moves. Some will mainly carry out supporting and pitching roles, and are known as bases. They are then balanced with smaller gymnasts who become the 'tops'. The different partnerships seen in competition are:\n\nIn competition, partnerships perform a routine to music, that has usually been choreographed specifically for them. The gymnasts carry out their acrobatic moves and combine them with dance, all in time to and in keeping with the style of the music. Partnerships are judged on artistry, difficulty of skill and the execution of skills.\n\nThe rules for the sport, known as the Code of Points, are governed by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique. These rules are subject to change every four years in line with the Olympic cycle, as in other disciplines of gymnastics.\n\nAcrobatic Gymnastics is part of the World Games, and are also included in the inaugural European Games as well as having a dedicated Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships held in even numbered years (known as World Sports Acrobatics Championships prior to 2006), and continental or region championships in odd numbered years. For example, the European Acrobatic Championships were held in Lisbon, Portugal in October 2013.\n\nThere are also numerous national, state, and regional competitions that are held in each country. Local and regional competitions often form the qualification stages required to compete at national championships. There is no requirement from the FIG for gymnasts to have qualified through their own national championships to compete internationally, but local governing bodies will often make their national team selections based on performance at national competition.\n\nAcrobatic gymnastics events often attract sizeable audiences, because they are highly entertaining, exhilarating, and suspenseful due to what look to be risky or daring moves. At the London 2012 Olympics, acrobatic partnerships were seen performing before the Olympic gymnastic events, and during the opening and closing ceremonies. It has been said that its appearance, despite not being an Olympic discipline is testament to its ability to entertain.\n\nGold, silver, and bronze medals are generally awarded in the usual fashion; although in some competitions, a minimum score is required to qualify for medals.\n\nRoutines are required at a competition depends on the level at which the gymnasts are competing. At the junior and senior levels, all three routines are required, whereas at lower age levels, a single simpler routine is required. Each of the routine types has a different emphasis, but all include tumbling and dance as elements. The different routine types are as follows:\n\n\nThe acrobatic gymnastics competitions are judged on a score out of 30.00, with 10.00 assigned for each of the following:\n\nIn the senior age group, routines can carry a difficulty tariff of greater than 10, meaning that scores of over 30 are not uncommon.\n\nThe judging panels of acrobatic gymnastics are similar to other disciplines of gymnastics where different panels of judges are overseen by a head judge, and each panel has a 'Chair of the Judging Panel' (CJP) who oversees that panel's activities. In acrobatic gymnastics, there are then difficulty judges (DJ) who only assess the difficulty of the elements in the routines; artistic judges (AJ) who only assess the performance and artistic merits of the routine; and execution judges (EJ) who only judge what points should be deducted based on imperfect execution of individual elements in the routine. The numbers of each type of judge on an acrobatic panel depends on the level of the competition and can vary from one to many (with the exception of the Chair, as there is only one CJP per panel).\n\nThe first use of acrobatics as a specific sport was in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, and the first world championships were in 1974.\n\nIn addition to the current five categories, two additional categories for tumbling (men's and women's) were included until the 1999 World Championships, though some groups still involve tumbling events.\n\nIn the United States, the first national sports acrobatics organization was called the United States Sports Acrobatics Federation (USSAF). Founded in 1975, its name was changed to the United States Sports Acrobatics (USSA) in the 1990s. The USSA then merged with USA Gymnastics in 2002, and Acrobatic Gymnastics is now a discipline therein.\n\n\n"}

It is a procedure that uses tape, attached to the skin, to physically keep in place muscles or bones at a certain position. This reduces pain and aids recovery. Taping is usually used to help recover from overuse and other injuries.\n\nThe general goals of athletic taping are to restrict the motion of an injured joint, compress soft tissues to reduce swelling, support anatomical structures involved in the injury, serve as a splint or secure a splint, secure dressing or bandages, protect the injured joint from re-injury, and protect the injured part while the injured part is in the healing process.\n\nTaping has many roles such as to support the ligaments and capsules of unstable joints by limiting excessive or abnormal anatomical movement. Taping also enhances proprioceptive feedback from the limb or joint. Finally, taping can support injuries at the muscle-tendon units by compressing and limiting movement and secure protective pads, dressings and splints.\n\nInjury Prevention: Athletic taping is recognized as one of the top preventative measures for reduction of injuries in collision sports. These injuries often occur as a result of extrinsic factors such as collision with other players or equipment. Athletic taping has also been shown to reduce the severity in injuries, as well as the occurrence of injury in most sports.\n\nInjury Management: Tape is often applied to manage symptoms of chronic injuries such as medial tibial stress syndrome (or shin splints), patella-femoral syndrome, and turf-toe. Athletic tape can be applied to ease pain symptoms as well. Taping along the nerve tract of irritated or inflamed tissue can shorten the inflamed region and reduce pain.\n\nOther post-injury benefits include: 1) stabilizing and supporting joints after injuries to the muscle or ligament; 2) assisting and allowing the athlete to return to activity after minor injuries; 3) preventing and reducing further harm to injured area; 4) maintaining proper biomechanics during activity; 5) preventing neuromuscular damage; and 6) reducing force on the area during activity.\n\n\nThere are set regulations and rules that govern the athletic taping techniques used by trainers and health professionals. There are a few aspects of athletic taping that are standardized.\n\n\n\nWraps and braces can be used instead or with taping to stabilize the affected area. Braces might alter muscular activity, where tape might not.\n\nStandard athletic tape is classified by the following characteristics:\n\n\n\nhttp://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1791-kinesio-taping-the-latest-sports-fad.html\n"}

{"id": "416953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=416953", "title": "Carrom", "text": "Carrom\n\nCarrom (also spelled carom) is a cue sport-based tabletop game of South Asian origin. The game is very popular in Afghanistan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and surrounding areas, and is known by various names in different languages. In South Asia, many clubs and cafés hold regular tournaments. Carrom is very commonly played by families, including children, and at social functions. Different standards and rules exist in different areas .\n\nThe game of carrom is believed to have originated from Afghanistan. One carrom board with its surface made of glass is still available in one of the palaces in Patiala, India. It became very popular among the masses after World War I. State-level competitions were being held in different States of India during early part of the nineteenth century. Serious carrom tournaments may have begun in Sri Lanka in 1935 but by 1958, both India and Sri Lanka had formed official federations of carrom clubs, sponsoring tournaments and awarding prizes.\n\nThe International Carrom Federation (ICF) was formed in the year 1988 in Chennai, India. The formal rules for the Indian version of the game were published in 1988. In the same year the ICF officially codified the rules. The game has been very popular throughout South Asia, mainly in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. It has gained some popularity in Europe and the United States where it has been introduced by the Indian diaspora. The United States Carrom Association reports on competitions in the US and Canada and has a player ranking list as of the last tournament.\n\nThe board and pieces can be bought in Europe or the US and are usually imported from India. The most expensive boards are made to a high standard with high quality wood and decorations though cheaper boards are available. Some of the largest exporters of carrom boards are in India, e.g. Precise, Surco, Syndicate Sports and Paul Traders.\n\nAside from cue sports, carrom also have similarities to table shuffleboard, and shove ha'penny; though smaller. It may be ancestral (via British India and French Indochina) to several similar Western games including novuss, crokinole, pichenotte, and pitchnut.\n\nThe objective of play is to use a \"striker\" disk with a flick of the finger to make contact with and move lighter object disks called \"carrom men\", which are thus propelled into one of four corner . The striker and carrom men are analogous to the and in cue sports, respectively.\n\nThe aim of the game is to () one's nine carrom men and the queen before the one's opponent does. The carrom queen is analogous to the () in the game of eight-ball pool.\n\nThe game is usually played on a board made of plywood. The dimensions of the standardised game is a square playing surface on a board of lacquered plywood. The edges of the playing surface are bounded by bumpers of wood, and the underside of each pocket is covered by a net which is 10 cm or larger.\n\nCarrom is played using small disks of wood or plastic known as \"carrom men\" (sometimes abbreviated CM, c.m. c/m, etc.). These pieces, aside from the special \"queen\", may also be known as \"seeds\", \"coins\", \"pawns\" (as in chess), or \"pucks\". Carrom men are designed to slide when struck and are made with a smooth surface that slides easily when laid flat on the board. They are struck by a \"Striker\" of standard specification which is larger and heavier. Carrom follows similar \"strike and pocket\" games, like pool, with its use of rebounds, angles and obstruction of opponent's carrom pieces.\n\nA carrom set contains 19 pieces (striker not included) in three distinct colours. Two colours to represent the players' pieces and one colour for the queen. The usual colours are white (or unstained) and black for the players and red for the queen.\n\nICF-approved pieces must have a diameter of no more than 3.18 cm and no less than 3.02 cm. The pieces must be between 7 and 9 mm thick. The pieces have a plain, rounded edge. The mass of the pieces must be between 5.0 and 5.5g.\n\nStriker pieces are used to push the carrom men and the queen across the board to the pockets. The carrom striker normally weighs 15 grams.\n\nThe red disk is called the queen; it is the most valuable piece. During board setup, it is placed at the centre of the circle. In accordance with the ICF rules, pocketing the queen adds 3 points to the player's total score. The dimensions of the queen must be the same as those of other carrom men.\n\n\nFine-grained powder is used on the board to enable the pieces to slide easily. Boric acid powder is the most commonly used for this purpose. The EU has classified Boric acid as a \"Serious Health Hazard\" and states that \"this substance may damage fertility or the unborn child\"\n\nIn the UK, many players use a version of anti-set-off spray powder from the printing industry which has specific electrostatic properties with particles of 50 micrometres in diameter. The powder is made from pure, food-grade vegetable starch.\n\nThe ICF promulgates International Rules of Carrom (also termed \"The Laws of Carrom\"). ICF acts as the governing body of carrom. The organisation also ranks players, sanctions tournaments and presents awards. ICF has many national affiliates such as the All-India Carrom Federation, Australian Carrom Federation, and United States Carrom Association.\n\nOrder of play is determined by the process of \"calling the carrom men\" or \"the toss\". Before commencing each match, an umpire hides one black carrom in one hand and one white carrom man in the other hand. The players guess which colour carrom man is being held in each hand. The player who guesses correctly wins the toss.\n\nThe winner of the toss strikes first, which is called the opening break. The winner of the toss has the option to change sides from white to black and give up the opening break. The winner of the toss may not pass this decision to the other player. If the winner of the toss chooses to change sides then the loser must strike first.\n\nThe player taking the first shot (or break) plays white carrom men. The opponent plays black.\nIf that player cannot score any points then that player loses the turn and their opponent can choose to play any carrom man, Black or White in favour.\n\nA successful pot entitles the player to shoot again. This means that, as in pool and snooker, it is possible for a player to pot all his/her pieces and cover the queen from the start of the game without the opponent being given the chance to shoot.\n\nAny player pocketing the queen is required to \"cover it\" immediately by pocketing one of their carrom man on the entitlement shot. If after potting the queen the player fails to \"cover it\", then the queen is returned to the centre of the table. It is illegal to pot the Queen after the last piece since the queen must always be \"covered\".\n\nThumbing is allowed by International Carrom Federation which allows the player to shoot with any finger including the thumb (known as \"thumbing\", \"thumb shot\", or \"thumb hit\").\n\nCrossing the diagonal lines on the board by coming in touch with it, or pocketing the striker is a foul. A player needs to ensure that his striking hand does not infringe/cross the diagonal lines aerially/physically. A player committing a foul must return one carrom man that was already pocketed.\n\nIf a player pockets his striker, he has to pay a penalty. This penalty is usually 10 points.\n\n\nPoint carrom is a variant that is popular with children or an odd number of players. Each player is allowed to pocket carrom men of any colour.\n\n\nFamily-point carrom (also known as simple-point carrom) is an informal variant suitable for an odd number of players. Each player is allowed to pocket carrom men of any colour.\n\n\n\nCarrom boards are available in various board sizes and corner-pocket sizes. There are smaller boards and boards with larger pockets. Boards with larger pockets are used by beginners for easier game play. On traditional carrom boards, the corner pockets are only slightly larger than the carrom men, but smaller than the striker. On boards with larger pockets, it is possible to pocket the striker, resulting in a \"\" as in pool. This results in a \"due\". On a due, the player has to return one previously pocketed carrom man to the board. The standardised association and federation size is a 74 × 74 cm (29 × 29 inch) square playing surface with 5–10 cm (2–4 in) borders. Other play-area sizes are not used in tournaments and competitions.\n\nA popular variant of the game called \"duboo\" is played mostly in Karachi, the largest city of Pakistan. In duboo, the size of the board is larger and the striker is slid instead of flicked.\n\nAmerican carrom is a variant developed around 1890 in the United States by Christian missionaries to Asia, who brought the game back with them. Concerned with young boys loitering around pool halls (where gambling was common), a Sunday school teacher named Henry L. Haskell altered the game for Western tastes. Much of the game is the same, but the striker's weight is reduced and the carrom men are smaller. Generally, instead of disks, carrom men (including the striker) are rings, originally of wood but today commercially made of light plastic. In addition, as an alternative to using the fingers to flick the striker, some of the American carrom boards use miniature cue sticks. American carrom boards also have built into the corners, rather than circular holes in the board, to make pocketing easier. While traditionally made boards vary widely, current commercially produced American carrom boards, by the Carrom Company of Michigan, are squares measuring 28 inches (71 cm) to a side, are printed with checkerboard and backgammon patterns, among others, and are sold with dice, skittles, etc. to allow other games to be played on the same board. These boards may also be printed with the circular pattern for playing crokinole.\n\nA relatively rare type among Western carrom boards has on the reverse a variant referred to colloquially as a \"carrom maze\", for an entirely different game. This side of the board, perhaps inspired by miniature golf, features a maze in the form of small plywood walls that restrict the carrom man to defined paths; the objective is to traverse the maze with a single carrom man and reach the end of the maze the fewest number of strokes, or to be the first to finish the maze among competitors. Various parts of the maze include difficult-to-navigate corners and traps in the form of visually distinguished areas in which the player's carrom piece must not be caught when coming to rest (or suffer a penalty of extra strokes or forced relocation of the player's carrom to an earlier position). Positive or bonus regions, usually small and hard to target, may offer shortcuts, allowing the player to relocate the carrom piece to a spot nearer the goal and continue, or providing a stroke count reduction, depending on the rules selected.\n\nCarrom was introduced to Japan in the early 20th century. Carrom became popular as , but fell in popularity in the Shōwa period. However, carrom is still popular in Hikone, Shiga under the name Hikone Karomu (Hikone carrom). The Hikone carrom board has larger pockets (not unlike those of pichenotte), the discs are arranged in a ring (also like in pichenotte), each player is given twelve discs instead of nine, and the queen (known as the \"jack\") is pocketed last (similar to Eight-ball or Black ball).\n\nA variant of carrom is played in South Africa under the name fingerboard (). The board has larger pockets, the discs are arranged in a ring, each player has ten discs instead of nine, and the queen (known as the \"donkey\") is pocketed last.\n\nThe English Film 'Slumdog Millionaire' was released by Director Danny Boyle also has many scenes in which Carrom gets played.\n\nThere were several companies that made copies of Haskell's carroms game board. The Transogram Company made a version of Haskell's game board in the 1950s and called it \"Skooker\". Coleco in the 1980s made reproductions with names like \"Carom-playing Games Board\" with up to 202 derived replication games. Some variants in the 1970s were called \"101 Games Board\" and \"Carom-playing 166 Games Board\". An ice-box manufacturer made \"Combinola\" and \"Crokinola\" boards as variants of the game.\n\n\nwww.carromshop.com\n\n"}

It is a composite basketball statistic that is derived from basic individual statistics: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers and shot attempts. The efficiency stat, in theory, accounts for both a player's offensive contributions (points, assists) and their defensive contributions (steals, blocks), but it is generally thought that efficiency ratings favor offense-oriented players over those who specialize in defense, as defense is difficult to quantify with currently tabulated statistics.\n\nThe NBA publishes online all the basic statistics recorded officially by the league. Individual player efficiency is expressed there by a stat referred to as 'efficiency' and abbreviated EFF. It is derived by a simple formula:\n\nThe formula was created by Kansas City sports reporter and statistician Martin Manley.\nDPR short for Defensive Player Rating is a stat that shows the Defensive prowess of a player showing their in game ability and defensive impact to their team by using a per game formula that equates for the amount of time spent on the court and taking into account psoition competition pace and era as well as other factors. This is the formula\n\n( Player spg+ Player bpg/team minutes played)-(times blown by*Pace of Players Era)* Total Average of Possesions+( Players DRTG*Team Pace)/Total number of years played\n\nThe most commonly used alternative to the EFF is the player efficiency rating developed by ESPN basketball statistician John Hollinger. It is denoted as PER, and is derived by a very complex calculation designed to compensate for different teams' varying style of play, among other factors. PER scores do not differ markedly from EFF scores, but player rankings will not be the same in both systems. \n\nA PER of 15 is considered average across the entire league (not true of EFF), and serves as a simple benchmark against which any player may be quickly compared to indicate his approximate net worth to an NBA franchise. Teams intending to compete for the championship typically seek to enlist at least two star players with high efficiency ratings above the low twenties.\n\nA PER of 30 over a span of more than a few games is considered exceptionally high. According to the modified PER formula used at Basketball-Reference.com, the highest PER ever achieved over an entire single season in the NBA was 31.84 by Wilt Chamberlain in 1962/63. No other player surpassed 30 until Michael Jordan in 1987/88 with a PER of 31.71. Since then, Jordan repeated the accomplishment three more times, and the milestone has also since been eclipsed by David Robinson, Stephen Curry, Shaquille O'Neal (three times), Tracy McGrady, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James (four times) and Anthony Davis. No PER statistics are available pre-1951/52 as the 'minutes played' statistic was first recorded during that season.\n\nSome currently active NBA players known for consistently high efficiency ratings include, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki and Dwight Howard.\n\nPlayer efficiency rating NBA records:\n\n\nThe EuroLeague, its second-tier level competition, the EuroCup, and several European national domestic leagues, use a different type of formula to determine the ratings and efficiency of players, called the performance index rating (PIR):\n\n\n\n"}

The park is named for Felton Little, an Auburn city councilman who donated the land for the park.\n\nIn the late 1940s the city of Auburn decided that the town needed a centrally-located park and football and baseball facilities for Auburn High School, which had previously been playing home matches at nearby Auburn University. The nearest property suitable for such a park to downtown was owned by Felton Little, who donated the land to the city in September 1947.

Since March 1, 2011, he has been the Official Baseball Historian for Major League Baseball.\n\nThorn was born in Stuttgart, Germany, where his Polish Jewish parents had come as refugees. Less than two years after Thorn was born, his family emigrated to the United States, and settled in The Bronx, New York City. “I fell in love with [baseball] cards before I loved the game, when I discovered that baseball was something that all the kids on my street corner cared about,\" Thorn said in a 2013 profile. \"I was an immigrant kid and was looking for a way into America. With my background I saw myself as an underdog, and so Brooklyn had to be my team. I began watching the game seriously when I was eight, in 1955, on my Admiral television, but I had already begun to follow their exploits in the daily newspapers my father brought home with him each night.”\n\nAs a teen he played baseball and basketball. However, at age 19 he suffered a stroke. \"It was severe,\" he said, \"knocking out my left-side function for months as well as patches of personal memory—though not the powerful visual memory I retain for images and facts and statistics.\" The stroke left him with a limp and precluded his further participation in athletic activities.\n\nThorn graduated from Beloit College in 1968. He is married to Erica Freudenberger, former director of the Red Hook, New York, Public Library, who is currently affiliated with the Southern Adirondack Library System. He and his wife live in Catskill, New York, where they moved in 2010. He claims to have been drawn to the town because of its \"slow pace,\" which suits him because, Thorn asserts, \"I pride myself on being the world’s most boring man.\"\n\nThorn has three sons from two previous marriages.\n\nThorn is the author and editor of numerous books, including \"Total Baseball: The Official Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball\", \"Total Football: The Official Encyclopedia of Major League Football\", \"Treasures of the Baseball Hall of Fame\", \"The Hidden Game of Baseball\", \"The Glory Days: New York Baseball 1947–1957\", and \"The Armchair Book of Baseball\". His 2011 book, \"Baseball in the Garden of Eden: The Secret History of the Early Game\", published by Simon & Schuster, was an in-depth chronicle of the seminal development and pioneers of the sport. A \"New York Times\" review of the latter book referred to Thorn as \"a researcher of colossal diligence.\"\n\nThorn is also the co-author with Pete Palmer and Bob Carroll of \"The Hidden Game of Football\" and with them co-editors of \"Total Football\". His book \"New York 400\", a graphic history of the city timed for its quadricentennial, created with the Museum of the City of New York and Running Press, was published in September 2009. Thorn is a columnist for \"Voices\", the publication of the New York Folklore Society.\n\nHe founded Total Sports Publishing and served as its publisher from 1998–2002.\n\nThorn served as the senior creative consultant for the 1994 Ken Burns documentary \"Baseball\".\n\nIn 2004, Thorn discovered documentation that traced the origins of baseball in America to 1791 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He has also attempted to shed light on the contributions of 19th century pioneers of the game, while debunking common misconceptions. \"I don't want anyone to think of me as a crusader on behalf of causes,\" he wrote. \"I'm only interested in setting the story straight, and in recognizing other stories for what they are, some of which are legend.\" Despite the claims of various localities to being the \"birthplace of baseball,\" Thorn simply follows facts. \"Abner Doubleday, Santa Claus, and Dracula,\" he notes, \"are equally mythic figures.\"\n\nIn June 2006, the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) bestowed on Thorn its highest accolade, the Bob Davids Award. The award honors those whose contributions to SABR and baseball reflect the ingenuity, integrity, and self-sacrifice of the founder and past president of SABR, L. Robert \"Bob\" Davids.\n\nOn March 1, 2011, he was named Official Baseball Historian for Major League Baseball., succeeding the late \"Chicago Tribune\" and \"Chicago Sun-Times\" baseball writer Jerome Holtzman, who served from 1999 until his death in 2008.\n\n"}

The main sections of the article describe the rules that apply to any situation in which judo is practiced, and those rules which apply only in judo competitions. Separate sections describe the history of the rules of judo, provide links to other sources of information on judo rules, and list the references for this article.\n\n\n\n\nThe scoring rules in use starting in 2017 are as follows:\nThe following rules are no longer in use:\n\nTwo types of penalties may be awarded. A \"shido\" (指導; literally \"guidance\" or \"instruction\") is awarded for minor rule infringements. A shido can also be awarded for a prolonged period of non-aggression. Recent rule changes allow for the first shidos to result in only warnings. If there is a tie, then and only then, will the number of shidos (if less than three) be used to determine the winner. After three shidos are given, the victory is given to the opponent. This is an indirect hansoku-make, and does not result in expulsion from the tournament. The penalty of \"hansoku make\" (反則負け; literally \"foul-play loss\") is awarded for major rule infringements, or for accumulating three \"shidos\". If \"hansoku make\" is awarded for a major rule infringement, it results not just in loss of the match, but in expulsion from the tournament. Note: Prior to 2017, the 4th shido was hansoku make.\n\nThe competition area must be padded with tatami. The minimum allowable size is 14 x 14 meters. The match takes place in an 8 x 8 meter to 10 x 10 meter zone within this larger area. The surrounding space acts as a safety zone. When two competition areas are side by side, there must be at least a 3-meter safety zone between them.\n\nRules related to grips are primarily motivated by the desire to avoid stalling, to avoid providing undue advantage, or to reduce the chance of injury.\n\n\nJudo competitions typically have some safety-related rules related to age: chokes are prohibited under a certain age (typically 13), and arm bars are prohibited under a certain age (typically 16).\n\nThe duration of matches is also dependent on the age of the competitors. Match length is typically three minutes for children, five minutes for teenagers and young adults, and three minutes for 'masters' (adults thirty years of age or older).\n\nRules related to the gi are primarily related either to safety or to preventing contestants from wearing gis that prevent their opponent from being able to get a grip on them.\n\n they must extend down to no more than 5 cm above the wrists with the arms extended in front of the body.\n\nThe official International Judo Federation (IJF) rules related to the provision of medical treatment and to the proper handling of situations involving illness or injury are relatively long and involved, since the exact nature and cause of an injury may themselves affect the awarding of the match, and since receiving some types of medical treatment, but not others, automatically ends the match. The latter fact makes it necessary for medical attendants at judo matches to have some understanding of this rather complex aspect of the rules of judo.\nThe medical team is not allowed to enter the fighting area without permission from the mat judge, and if a contestant receives medical treatment he automatically forfeits the match. Nosebleeds, for example cannot be treated by the medical team, the contestant must fix it himself with materials provided by the medical team, proper procedure is stuffing cotton balls up the nostrils, while applying tape around the head.\nIf a contestant is rendered unconscious without a choking technique, and is unable to wake up, the medical team has to take immediate action and they can't wait for the contestant's consent, he forfeits the match automatically.\nA contestant can ignore any injuries he has, and keep fighting. This requires that it is not of any discomfort to the opponent, e.g. bleeding over an opponent can cause penalties. If the bleeding is tried to be stopped three times, with no effect, the match is forfeited.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3989243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3989243", "title": "Layup", "text": "Layup\n\nA layup in basketball is a two-point shot attempt made by leaping from below, laying the ball up near the basket, and using one hand to bounce it off the backboard and into the basket. The motion and one-handed reach distinguish it from a jump shot. The layup is considered the most basic shot in basketball. When doing a layup, the player lifts the outside foot, or the foot away from the basket. It is a foul if, during your layup, you hold the other person's hand or push it away to avoid him or her from defending. On the other hand, it is considered a foul if the defender jumps in front of you in the middle of nowhere and you both crash, in this case the defender causes a foul. A layup is very handy and to defend it, you just basically need to stand in front of the opponent with your arms stretched out.\n\nAn undefended layup is usually a high percentage shot. The main obstacle is getting near the rim and avoiding blocks by taller defenders who usually stand near the basket. Common layup strategies are to create spaces, release the ball from a different spot, or use alternate hands. A player able to reach over the rim might choose to perform a more spectacular and higher percentage slam dunk (dropping or throwing the ball from above the rim) instead.\n\nAs the game has evolved through the years, so has the layup. Several different versions of the layup are around today.\nLayups can be broadly categorized into two types: the underarm and the overarm. The underarm layup involves using most of the wrist and the fingers to 'lay' the ball into the net or off the board. This layup is more commonly known as the finger roll. George Gervin was one of the early practitioners of a showy finger roll layup. Notable past NBA players who rely heavily on the underarm finger roll are Mike Bibby and Allen Iverson.\n\nFinger rolls today have many forms, including the \"Around the World\" which involves a complete circle around the player before the layup and a variety of faking in the approach to the rim. A classic example is a play by Jason Williams during his time with Sacramento, in which Williams brought the ball behind his back with his right hand, in a fake of a back pass, and then brought it front again with the same hand for the finish (reminiscent of Bob Cousy, who pioneered the move).\n\nThe other layup is the overhand shot, similar to a jump shot but from a considerably close range. Overhand layups nearly always involve the action of the backboard. Players like Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone have used this move to great effect.\n\nThe Reverse Layup is a more stylish method of making the ball from close. Generally you fake the defender into defending a regular layup on the near side and then jump to the far side of the basket before shooting.\n\nIt is common for players to create room for a layup by making use of the allotted two steps before the layup attempt. Variations and improvisations exist, yet the most common form is the 'Euro-Step'. So called as it was introduced to the NBA by European players, it has been adopted mainly by guards and forwardsas it relies heavily on agility and footwork to avoid larger defenders, although bigger players such as Joel Embiid have been seen making use of the move. The Euro-Step itself involves picking up one's dribble while dribbling, taking one step in one direction, then quickly taking a step in the other direction to avoid the defender to create room for a layup attempt. To make use of the move efficiently, it is best to dribble in aggressively then take two broad steps in different directions while simultaneously bringing the ball over one's head in the direction one is stepping for maximum evasion and protection while potentially drawing a foul.\n\nMichael Carter-Williams has not made a layup in an actual NBA Game. He is the only player that has attempted over 100 and made none.\n\n"}

The film's plot surrounds a retired Major League Baseball player who makes a comeback at age 47 in order to attain 3,000 hits.\n\nStan Ross is the franchise player of the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team. After recording his 3,000th hit, the selfish, narcissistic Ross immediately retires, leaving the team without one of its star players in the middle of the 1995 playoff race, showing every bit of disregard for his teammates' feelings. During the next nine years, Ross uses his nickname as a business tool, owning several profitable properties under the name \"Mr. 3000\" that make him increasingly wealthy.\n\nIn 2004, the Brewers retire Ross' number so they can get rid of Ross for good, and also draw a large crowd. Although many fans come to the ceremony, other players, including teammates and fellow stars Robin Yount, Cecil Cooper, and Paul Molitor, stay away. Only his best friend Anthony (Boca) Carter and a middle relief pitcher from his early days in the majors named Bill (Big Horse) Berelli attend, and the ex-pitcher chastises Ross for his arrogant attitude.\n\nRoss learns that, due to a clerical error, he retired with 2,997 hits instead of 3,000. The error also partially contributes to Ross not being voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame and makes his \"Mr. 3000\" marketing gimmick inaccurate. Ross seeks to return to the game at the age of 47 to get three more hits, secure his place in the record books, and keep his local post-career marketing gimmick intact.\n\nA top Brewers executive, citing the large attendance at Ross' number retirement ceremony and the fact that the Brewers are out of playoff contention, agrees to bring Ross back during the September roster expansion. The team's younger players only know of Ross as a self-centered player, and team superstar Rex \"T-Rex\" Pennebaker, who is pompous and arrogant like Ross, sees him as unneeded and too old to play. Manager Gus Panas refuses to speak to Ross because of his abrupt retirement, and the sportswriters continually criticize him.\n\nDespite his predictions to the contrary Ross struggles to regain his baseball form. He goes hitless in his first 27 at-bats. His comeback is reported by television sportscaster Maureen \"Mo\" Simmons, who resumes a former romantic relationship with Ross. He gets two hits, including a home run, to increase his career total to 2,999.\n\nRoss becomes a mentor to the younger players and urges Pennebaker to learn from his own mistakes as a baseball star and to be a team player, so that Pennebaker will not end up like him – all alone. This inspires the Brewers to a late-season comeback and a respectable finish. Ross attempts to become serious with Simmons and make her a permanent part of his life, but she is reluctant to believe he is a changed man, particularly after he skips a team practice to go on national television with Jay Leno and begin boasting again.\n\nIn his last at-bat of the season, with a chance to be a hero, Ross has a vision of his earlier years, when he was considered always dependable for the team. It inspires him to sacrifice his last chance with a bunt instead so the team can win a game and finish third in its division. Although Ross never reaches the \"3,000\" milestone, his newfound generosity and attitude gets him inducted into the Hall of Fame. He renames his businesses \"Mr. 2,999.\"\n\n\nPortions of the film were filmed at Marquette University High School, as well as Miller Park, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and at Zephyr Field in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews, earning a score of 54% on Rotten Tomatoes which observed \"Bernie Mac demonstrates he can play the game even if the movie's a few innings short of a complete game.\" The film took over $8 million at the box office on its opening weekend. In all it took $21,811,169 in the US and Canada, and a further $28,190 when it was released in Spain, for a global total of $21,839,377.\n\n"}

The indoor facility offered the ability to control climate conditions to produce the highest quality ice.\n\nConstruction of The Oval began in 1985, nearly four years after Calgary had been designated host of the XV Olympic Winter Games. Like the Olympic Saddledome, most of the Oval's structure was built using precast, prestressed concrete. Twenty eight beams were laid along the outside of the perimeter of the building to support 84 additional beams used to construct a lattice frame for the arched roof. The interior scaffolding used to hoist these 84 beams had to be lowered a centimetre at a time in a predetermined sequence in order to distribute the load of the roof equally to each of the 28 exterior support beams. Construction was completed by the end of the summer of 1987, officially opening in September 1987, five months before the Olympics.\nIt was during the speed skating events of the Olympic Winter Games in 1988 that The Oval became known as \"the fastest ice on Earth,\" as world records were set in seven events (Men's 500 m, 1500 m, 10,000 m, and Women's 500 m, 1000 m, 3000 m, 5000 m), and Olympic records were set in the other three events (Men's 1500 m, 5000 m, and Women's 1500 m).\n\nThe combination of the climate-controlled facility and the effects of high altitude have been credited for the fast ice surface. Seven world and three Olympic records were broken during the Games, resulting in the facility earning praise as \"the fastest ice on Earth\". Throughout the following 14 years the vast majority of speed skating world records were set at The Oval. By 2013, at celebrations for the 25th anniversary of the 1988 Winter Games, the former CEO of the Winter Games said that the Olympic Oval had produced over \"150 world record skating times\". \n\nAlong with the 400 m long-track speed skating oval, the Olympic Oval also includes two international-sized ice rinks for short-track speed skating and ice hockey, a 450 m running track surrounding the main oval, and an eight-lane 110 m sprint track for year-round athletics training. By 2013, hundred of Canadian athletes were training in the Oval year round. Saskatoon-native Catriona Le May Doan, who won the gold medal in speedskating at the 1998 Winter Olympics and in the 2002 Winter Olympics began training at the Oval soon after its construction. \n\nThe Oval continues to be regarded as a premier speed skating venue, and a preferred training facility for speed skating teams across the globe. \n\nWhen not hosting hockey games and speed skating competitions, The Oval is open to public skating, family day events, and the Calgary Science Fair.\n\n"}

The surface system is made of a polymer composite, comprising a monofilament fibre and impregnated carrier layer. This sits on top of a shock absorption layer in an attempt to give an authentic responsive and reactive feel. Other components in Snowflex include an integrated misting system, known as BritonMist, for friction reduction and an impervious membrane for recycling of water. The base is a woven controlling layer which prevents earth movement. The surface layer is manufactured in tile form and as such Snowflex forms a homogenous system which can be cut and formed into features and shapes such as those found in alpine environments.\n\n\nDue to the complex nature of Snowflex, it is not possible to self-install. Instead the company which designed and manufactures it operates as installers as well. This is a first for snowsports surfaces as previous materials were able to be installed by slope operators at their own cost.\n\nFollowing its launch in 1996 Snowflex has been installed at over fifty full scale slope operations, including: Bearsden, near Glasgow; Noeux les Mines in northern France (pictured above); Valladolid in Spain. There are many minor training installations around the world including Olympic training centres in the USA, Switzerland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Germany, Finland etc. \n\nMany other full scale installations can be seen around the world, including France as mentioned previously, Turkey (where the worlds largest synthetic slope is currently installedin Ankara), South Africa, and the USA.

Other famous sports in 19th-century Georgia were horse polo and lelo, a traditional Georgian game later replaced by rugby union.\n\nRugby union is a popular team sport played in Georgia.\n\nWrestling remains a historically important sport of Georgia and some historians think that the Greco-Roman style of wrestling incorporates many Georgian elements. Within Georgia, one of the most popularized styles of wrestling is the Kakhetian style. However, there have been a number of other styles that are not as widely used today. For example, the Khevsureti region of Georgia has three different styles of wrestling.\n\nDespite the country's small size, it has produced several world elite basketball players including Tornike Shengelia, Vladimir Stepania, Nikoloz Tskitishvili and most notably Zaza Pachulia. \nThe people of Georgia have shown great support for their national team.

{"id": "7548283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7548283", "title": "Sør Arena", "text": "Sør Arena\n\nSør Arena (\"South Arena\") is a football stadium located at Torsvika in Kristiansand, Norway. The all-seater has a capacity of 14,563 people, and serves as the home ground of Tippeligaen side IK Start. It was designed by Kjell Kosberg, and is architecturally similar to Aker Stadion. The venue has seen concerts by Elton John, Dolly Parton and A-ha, among others.. UEFA refers to the stadium as Kristiansand Arena.\n\nConstruction started in 2006, and the stadium opened on 15 April 2007, replacing Kristiansand Stadion as Start's home ground. The venue cost 400 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which the stadium itself cost NOK 250 million, after significant cost overruns. While originally planned with artificial turf, the venue was ultimately built with a natural grass pitch. The venue and the holding company Start Stadion were taken over by Sparebanken Sør, the main creditor, in 2008. They subsequently also took over Start Toppfotball, the company running the club. Both companies were sold to Ernst Ravnaas in 2009. Following decreased attendance, ahead of the 2011 season the seating on the corners was sold as advertisement space and the maximum capacity has artificially been reduced to 11,700.\n\nTraditionally, Start has played their home games at Kristiansand Stadion, a municipal multi-purpose stadium. In May 2005, the municipal council approved the plans for a new stadium for Start. At the time, the structure was estimated to cost NOK 177 million, of which NOK 120 million would be for the stadium itself, while the remaining would be for commercial properties.\n\nThe club held an architecture competition, and received six bids. On 28 September 2005, Start Toppfotball announced that they had selected the design by Kjell Kosberg from Kosbergs Arkitektkontor, who had previously designed Aker Stadion and Briskeby Arena. The default proposal contained a spectator capacity for 9,948 people, but the plans were scalable, allowing for increased capacity if the club so wanted. Ernst Ravnaas, co-owner of the club, stated that given the recent high attendance, he wanted to build a larger stadium than the default proposal. Financing was planned with a free lot from Kristiansand Municipality, a NOK 40 million loan from the municipality, a NOK 20 million grant from Cultiva, a municipal culture fund, NOK 20 in value added tax refund, NOK 10 to 20 million in naming rights, the sale of commercial property, NOK 30 to 40 million in a bank loan, and the remaining with share capital from Start Toppfotball.\nIn October, the club stated that they hoped to finance a further expansion of the stadium to 14,000 seats by selling part of the lot to a private developer, which would use it to build a 17-story building. On 23 December, Rasmussengruppen signed a contract where they bought shares worth NOK 45 million in Start Toppfotball. In addition, they paid NOK 15 million for the right to build of commercial property in conjunction with the stadium, and an option to purchase the high-rise lot for NOK 25 million. The high-rise lot was again bought from the municipality for NOK 15 million. Combined with the free lot for the stadium, Start Toppfotball received municipal subsidies of NOK 25 million for constructing the venue.\n\nA controversy arose regarding whether to lay natural or artificial turf. Kristofer Hæstad, one of Start's star players, stated that he would not continue to play for the club if artificial turf was laid. The contract with the municipality stated that the stadium would have to be built with artificial turf. In March, Start decided that they would instead lay natural grass, and if necessary pay the municipality for the cost of building another artificial turf venue. The name of the venue was announced on 21 October, after the club had signed a ten-year naming rights agreement with Sparebanken Sør worth NOK 35 million. The rights to sell the naming rights were first transferred from the stadium owner to the company Rettighetskompaniet AS, which subsequently sold these to Sparebanken Sør.\nConstruction of the stadium was subject to significant cost overruns. These were mostly caused by the increased size of both spectator and commercial area, increased standard to VIP facilities, a general increase in construction costs, and the deadline to finish the venue in time for the league to start. Total investments exceeded NOK 400 million, of which 250 million was paid for by Start. This resulted in the stadium company having a debt of NOK 173 million, in addition to NOK 60 million in share equity. In November 2007, Start sold of commercial space at the stadium for NOK 25 million to finance part of the cost overrun.\n\nThe opening of the stadium took place on 15 April 2007, in the season's first league game, against Viking. The game attracted 14,448 spectators, a record attendance and the only time the venue has been sold out. After the opening, the pitch was the worst in the league, and by May the grass within the penalty areas and along the one side had been replaced. By 2010, the pitch quality had improved and was regarded as \"world class\" by the Start players. The cost of preparing the pitch, including snow removal, ahead of the season is about NOK 500,000. Ahead of the 2008 season, the 1,400 club seats had to be replaced for a cost of NOK 1.5 million, because the wood in the chairs were rotting. The reason was that the chairs were designed for in-door use, and the necessary precautions to protect them when not in use had not been taken.\n\nThe stadium had a book value of NOK 230 million, way over the real value, causing Start Toppfotball to have to write down the investment. To finance this, Sparebanken Sør, the main creditor, bought Start Stadion from Start Toppfotball for NOK 2,600 on 23 December 2008. At the same time, the club signed a 40-year agreement to lease the stadium from Sparebanken Sør for NOK 12 million per year. On 7 March 2009, the bank also bought the remaining shares of Start Toppfotball, becoming the sole owner of both the club and the stadium. Sparebanken Sør offered to sell Sparebanken Sør Arena to the municipality for NOK 100 million, but the municipality rejected this on 29 May. The bank subsequently sold Start Stadion and Start Toppfotball to Ravnaas on 25 June for NOK 1 each. Start Stadion had at the time a debt of NOK 34 million to Start Toppfotball, NOK 60 million to Sparebanken Sør and NOK 40 million to Kristiansand Municipality. Sparebanken Sør lost NOK 80 million in their transactions with Start and Sparebanken Sør Arena.\n\nFollowing a fall in game attendance in 2009 and 2010, Start decided ahead of the 2011 season to reduce the stadium's capacity. Advertisement banners were sold to cover the corners, thus reducing the capacity to 11,700 tickets. The club stated that the intention was to move spectators closer together to increase the atmosphere, and at the same time making it easier to sell out the stadium. In February 2012, Kristiansand District Court sentenced Start to pay NOK 6.4 million in value added tax on the naming rights. The club stated that they believed the naming rights were exempt. After the 2011 season, Start was again relegated to the First Division. In an attempt to better the club's financial situation, Start agreed to lay artificial turf on Sparebanken Sør Arena, in exchange for NOK 250,000 in municipal funding to use the stadium for recreational sports. Removal of the natural pitch started on 28 May 2012.\n\nStart won the 2012 Norwegian First Division and were promoted to the top league for their 2013 season. Start Stadion had been involved in a legal suit with the Norwegian Tax Administration over whether value added tax was to be paid for the stadium's naming rights. The company lost the case both in Agder Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, resulting in the company having to pay NOK 9 million in taxes. As the company did not have such values, it was forced to filed for bankruptcy on 23 May 2013. At the time the company had a debt of NOK 107 million. At the time the municipality has commenced negotiations with Sparebanken Sør to purchase the stadium. Football economist Tor Geir Kvinen stated that Sparebanken Sør had by then spent NOK 200 million on subsidizing Start and that in reality the municipality and bank were funding the repeated deficits in the club. The municipality announced a plan in October 2013, whereby they would purchase the bank's NOK 54 million loan for NOK 44 million and receive all the shares in the stadium company. The bank would then buy the naming rights for ten more years for NOK 10 million and yet unsold commercial property. The municipality would then be owed NOK 64 million by the stadium company, up from NOK 46 million.\n\nThe stadium has a capacity for 14,563 spectators, of which 1,400 are club seating. However, the seating is artificially reduced to 11,700. Built into the stadium is of commercial property. The venue has many architectural similarities with Aker Stadion, home of Molde FK, which was also designed by Kosberg. During one winter, the pitch was accidentally converted to a bandy field, when it was covered with a layer of ice up to thick because of cold weather.\n\nThe Norway national under-21 football team won 2–0 over Estonia at Sparebanken Sør Arena on 20 November 2007. The stadium hosted a UEFA Women's Euro 2009 qualifying match on 3 May 2008, in which Norway beat Israel 7–0. The final in the 2011–13 International Challenge Trophy was held at the stadium on 14 August 2013, in which the Norway national under-23 football team lost 0–1 in extra time against Turkey A2.\n\nConcerts held at the stadium have included Elton John in 2007, which attracted a crowd of 19,000, Dolly Parton in 2008 and A-ha in 2010. A 2008 tour with artists from Norske Talenter and Idol attracted only 800 people, including free entrants. From 2011, the finals in PlussbankCup, a junior football tournament held in Kristiansand, are hosted at Sparebanken Sør Arena.\n\nThe following list shows the average, maximum and minimum attendance for Start's home games in the Premier League.

It also housed the men's hockey team until 1993, when it moved into its own building, Mariucci Arena. The building is known affectionately as \"The Barn\", and its student section is known as \"The Barnyard\".\n\nWilliams Arena is located on the southwest corner of the intersection of University Avenue and 19th Ave. SE in Minneapolis on the U of M's East Bank campus. It is in a neighborhood called Stadium Village, named for the old Memorial Stadium that stood there until its demolition in 1992. The arena is adjacent to TCF Bank Stadium, Mariucci Arena, and Ridder Arena, where the football and hockey teams respectively play.\n\nInitially known as the Minnesota Field House (another building has that name today), Williams Arena was constructed in the 1920s and opened in 1928. The original construction of Williams Arena cost $650,000. The arena was remodeled in 1950, and renamed Williams Arena after Dr. Henry L. Williams, the football coach from 1900 to 1921.\n\nAs part of the 1950 renovation, it was divided into two separate arenas within one building—a larger one for basketball and a smaller one for hockey. Both arenas were called Williams Arena until March 2, 1985, when the hockey section was renamed Mariucci Arena after longtime Gopher hockey coach John Mariucci. The hockey team moved into a new building across the street from Williams in 1993, also named Mariucci Arena. The old Mariucci Arena within Williams was remodeled into the Sports Pavilion and now houses the volleyball, wrestling, and gymnastic teams.\n\nThe venue hosted the 1951 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament championship game and the 1964 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Mideast Regional. Williams Arena has hosted the 1st and 2nd rounds of the NCAA women's basketball tournament in 2005, 2007, and 2010. The hockey portion of Williams hosted the Frozen Four in 1958 and 1966. The Minnesota Lynx played all of their 2017 postseason home games at Williams Arena, ultimately winning the franchise's fourth WNBA championship in the building.\n\nWilliams Arena was used for the filming of scenes in Columbia Pictures' 1978 motion picture release, \"Ice Castles\".\n\nThe building has an arched roof, in the same manner as an airplane hangar. The double arch steel beams allows an open space for the bleachers and floor. There are some seats with partially obscured views due to the upper deck extending past the trusses. Over the summer of 2012, a new Daktronics videoboard and fascia displays were installed as part of a sporting facility update, replacing the older board. The new board is 11'7\"x13'8\" with LED rings above and below the main display. The fascia extends 360° around the arena.\n\nWilliams Arena features an unusual raised floor design. The court surface is raised above the ground approximately two feet so that players' benches, officials tables, etc., are actually below the court. The same goes for fans with the first row looking at players at about knee-level. Normally, other than the officials and those players actively playing, only head coaches are allowed to be on the court itself. The raised floor is one of only a few remaining examples left and contributes significantly to the historic aura of the 80-year-old arena. This served as the inspiration for the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship to host stadiums for their Final Four as of 2009 to have the floor about three feet off the stadium floor as part of an increased capacity to a minimum of 70,000. The floor in Williams Arena recently underwent a replacement. PCL Construction began work on , replacing the original playing surface from 1928 with a new floor along with new basketball goals. This was the first major upgrade to the facility since a renovation occurred in the early 1990s. Memorial Gymnasium at Vanderbilt University and Hinkle Fieldhouse at Butler University are two other existing arenas with a raised floor. Robertson Memorial Field House at Bradley University, since demolished, also used a raised floor.\n\nFrom 1950 until the opening of Marriott Center at Brigham Young University in 1971, it had the largest capacity of any collegiate basketball arena in the country. Hinkle Fieldhouse at Butler University also was constructed in 1928, and held the honor of being the highest capacity arena until the remodeling of Williams Arena in 1950.\n\nWhen the Gophers basketball team first organized, they played games in the on-campus YMCA. In 1896, the team moved into the campus Armory, a large building with gymnasium space for the team to use, even if basketball was not its primary purpose. The Gophers remained in the Armory for almost thirty years. Halfway through the 1924–25 season, coach Harold Taylor moved the team from the University Armory to the Kenwood Armory in downtown Minneapolis. This significantly increased the attendance: capacity at the University Armory was 2,000, but it was 6,500 at Kenwood. The team only played at Kenwood for a few seasons, however, as the University of Minnesota Field House (later known as Williams Arena) opened partway through the 1927–1928 season. The team moved in on January 31, 1928.\n\n\n"}
