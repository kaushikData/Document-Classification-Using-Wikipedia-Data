Fighting between the teams continued in the dressing rooms after the final whistle.\n\nBrazil had scored six goals in two group games, and Hungary had scored 17. Brazil had a reputation for attractive and attacking football; in their group games, they beat Mexico 5–0, and drew the other 1–1 with Yugoslavia after extra time. Yugoslavia had beaten France 1–0 in their other group game, which meant that both Brazil and Yugoslavia were equal on points in their group. Goal difference was not used to decide who finished top of the group; instead, lots were drawn, with Brazil being elected group winners. Hungary had revolutionized football tactics and coaching in Europe. Their fluid and open style of play – an early form of total football – meant that they were unbeaten for the previous 4 years. Hungary were clear winners of their group, winning both of their group games – they beat South Korea 9–0, and West Germany 8–3.\n\nThe match was played in driving rain, producing slippery conditions and a hard to control ball. Hungary took the lead in the third minute, with Nándor Hidegkuti scoring. Four minutes later, Sándor Kocsis made it 2–0 to Hungary. Brazil was awarded a penalty; Djalma Santos scored to make it 2–1 at half time.\n\nIn the second half, Hungary was awarded a penalty; Mihály Lantos scored to make the score 3–1. The penalty award was the cue for a pitch invasion by Brazilian journalists and officials, who had to be ushered off by police. The game then degenerated into a series of increasingly violent fouls and cynical tactics, with Brazilian forward Julinho somehow scoring to bring the score to 3–2. After this, József Bozsik was fouled by Nilton Santos; the two men started fighting, and both were sent off. Hungary scored a fourth goal via Sándor Kocsis to make the score 4–2 to Hungary. The last moments of the game was little more than a running battle between the two teams; Brazilian forward Humberto Tozzi kicked Hungary's Gyula Lorant prior to the final whistle and was sent off.\n\nIn total, 42 free kicks and 2 penalties were awarded, with 4 cautions and 3 dismissals issued.\n\nThe ill-temper continued after the game, with the Brazilian players invading the Hungarian dressing room and continuing the on-pitch fighting. Despite evidence from independent witnesses of violent conduct from both sides, football's governing body FIFA did nothing, leaving discipline to the respective countries.\n\nThe game's referee Arthur Ellis commented: \"I thought it was going to be the greatest game I'd ever see. I was on top of the world. Whether politics and religion had something to do with it I don't know, but they behaved like animals. It was a disgrace. It was a horrible match. In today's climate so many players would have been sent off the game would have been abandoned. My only thought was that I was determined to finish it.\"\n\n\"The Times\" newspaper correspondent on 28 June 1954 drew a similar conclusion; \"Never in my life have I seen such cruel tackling, the cutting down of opponents as if with a scythe, followed by threatening attitudes and sly jabs when officialdom was engaged elsewhere.\"\n\n\"This was a battle; a brutal, savage match,\" recalled Hungary manager Gustav Sebes, who needed four stitches for a facial wound received during the fighting. \"At the end we had won 4–2 but it wasn't over yet. Brazilian photographers and fans flooded on to the pitch and police were called to clear it. Players clashed in the tunnel and a small war broke out in the corridor to the dressing rooms - everyone was having a go; fans, players and officials.\"\n\nThe \"Battle of Berne\" in theoretical abstract terms, was one of the highest ranked contests of the 20th century according to the Elo rating system in men's senior international competition.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first presented as part of the ESPY Awards at the 2002 edition after broadcaster ESPN purchased the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society in the summer of 2001. The Best Outdoor Sportsman ESPY Award trophy, designed by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan, was given to the outdoor sportsperson adjudged to be the best in a given calendar year. From the 2004 to 2008 ceremonies, the winner was chosen by online voting through choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee. Before that, determination of the winners was made by an panel of experts. Through the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in July and reflect performance from the June previous.\n\nThe inaugural winner of the Best Outdoor Sportsman ESPY Award in 2002 was American bass angler Kevin VanDam. During 2001 and 2002, he won the Bassmaster Classic XXXI, the 2001 Wal-Mart FLW Championship, and attained the rank of the top-ranked angler worldwide during that period. VanDam became the first of two bass anglers to be nominated, and hence to win, an ESPY Award. Bass anglers have been the most successful sportspeople (with two victories and eight nominations) with the win of Jay Yelas at the 2003 iteration. It was presented to one woman in its history, logroller Tina Bosworth, in the 2004 edition. The winner of the Best Outdoor Sportsman ESPY Award in 2005 was lumberjacker J. R. Salzman after winning 14 medals at the Great Outdoor Games and claimed five logrolling titles at the Lumberjack World Championship between 1998 and 2005. After that, the accolade was partially replaced by the Best Angler ESPY Award for the 2006 edition before returning the next year. It was permanently discontinued after the 2008 ceremony.\n\n"}
{"id": "4951408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4951408", "title": "Bicycle rollers", "text": "Bicycle rollers\n\nBicycle rollers are a type of bicycle trainer that make it possible to ride a bicycle indoors without moving forward. However, unlike other types of bicycle trainers, rollers do not attach to the bicycle frame, and the rider must balance him or herself on the rollers while training. Bicycle rollers normally consist of three cylinders, drums, or \"rollers\" (two for the rear wheel and one for the front), on top of which the bicycle rides. A belt connects the middle roller to the front roller, causing the front wheel of the bicycle to spin when the bicycle is pedaled. The spacing of bicycle rollers can usually be adjusted to match the bicycle's wheelbase. Generally, the front roller is adjusted to be slightly ahead of the hub of the front wheel.\n\nBicycle rollers are nearly as old as the bicycle itself. Mile-a-minute Murphy is pictured riding on them as early as 1901.\n\nBalancing the bicycle without riding off the rollers is an extra challenge for the rider and requires much more balance and attention than bicycle trainers. Some cyclists find that this increased attention to balance enhances their workout, while other cyclists simply prefer the more stable trainers. Rollers are also used by bicycle racers to finely tune their balance, a skill needed for drafting and the close quarters of a peloton during races. \n\nNovice cyclists often start by placing the bicycle rollers in a hallway or door frame where there is a nearby wall for support in the case of a fall. Removing any sharp and dangerous objects from the area is a must and a helmet is often worn, even though the user might be indoors. Beginners quickly discover that it is easier to maintain one's balance by focusing on a point a few yards ahead rather than looking directly down at the front wheel. In addition, it is easier to stay on the rollers in a higher gear when the wheels are spinning faster. Also, the user has no forward momentum while on bicycle rollers, which drastically reduces the possibility of injury in the event of a loss of balance or a fall.Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law\n\nThe rollers themselves may be made from wood, aluminum alloy, or plastic. Aluminum alloy is usually a better choice because plastic rollers tend to bend and misshape from their regular cylindrical shape after use. Some rollers also have a concave cylinder shape (parabolic) to help keep the rider in the center of the rollers.\n\nThe frame may be made from welded steel or extruded aluminum. The frame may fold in the middle for storage or transport.\n\nRollers are available in different widths (from 10\" to 18\") and diameters (from 4.5\" to 2.25\" for higher resistance). Some bicycle rollers use two front drums or cylinders instead of just one.\n\nResistance may be added by having the spinning rollers driving some additional mechanism such as a fan. Some rollers have an internal flywheel on the back cylinder. This mimics real-world resistance to continuous acceleration and makes it possible to coast for up to 30 seconds.\n\nIt is possible to remove the front wheel and mount the front fork in a stand (usually sold separately) to duplicate the stability of other bicycle trainers.\n\nSome rollers place the roller frame inside an external track so they can move (slide) fore and aft - which allow for simulating extreme pedalling off the saddle, as if climbing a hill. Strong elastic bands or springs are attached to each corner of the frame and pull and hold the roller frame in the tracks. A bicycle on the road can move fore and aft relative to the rider, and these rollers attempt to duplicate this effect.\n\nRollers may also be used for roller races (or goldsprints if fork stands are used). Two or more bikes are placed on rollers side by side, the rollers are connected to a timing system. Timing systems either use modern electronics and digital projection, or a large analog clock with a hand for every rider representing their distance traveled. Roller racing was popular in 1950s Britain, often preceding films at the cinema or taking place in between dances at dance halls.\nThe British Schools Cycling Association carries on the tradition of true roller racing without fork stands and maintains the BSCA National Competition Roller Records\n\nIn 1993, the Century Road Club Association of New York City retired their vintage rollers and mechanical dial for Kreitler Rollers and a computer system that could clock up to six racers at a time. Elsewhere in America, every winter a USA Cycling sanctioned event called the Iowa Roller Race Series defines roller racing champions.\nThe series uses Kreitler Rollers and a DOS program Roller Fusion, which was commissioned in the 1990s by the late Al Kreitler. In honor of Al Kreitler, the promoter of the Iowa Roller Race Series, Greg Harper, organized the 2011 Al Kreitler Memorial Killer 2-Mile Roller Races. (To clarify, Al Kreitler was not killed; his dog was named \"Killer.\")\n\n\n"}
{"id": "490771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=490771", "title": "Black belt (martial arts)", "text": "Black belt (martial arts)\n\nIn East Asian martial arts, the black belt denotes a high competence in the martial art. It is often associated with a teaching grade though frequently not the highest grade or the \"expert\" of public perception. It is a relatively recent invention (dating from the late 19th century).\n\nThe systematic use of belt color to denote the rank was first used in Japan by Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo, who first devised the colored belt system using obi (sash), and awarded the first black belts to denote a Dan rank in the 1880s. Previously, Japanese Koryu instructors tended to provide certificates. Initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in kimono, only white and black obi were used. It was not until the early 1900s, after the introduction of the judogi, that an expanded colored belt system of awarding rank was created. Other martial arts later adopted the custom or a variation of it (e.g., using colored sashes) to denote rank. This includes martial arts that traditionally did not have a formalized rank structure. This kind of ranking is less common in arts that do not claim a far eastern origin, though it is used in the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program.\n\nRank and belts are not equivalent between arts, styles, or even within some organizations. In some arts, a black belt is expected in three years, while in others ten years may be common. Testing for black belt is commonly more rigorous and more centralized than for lower grades.\n\nIn contrast to the \"black belt as master\" stereotype, a black belt commonly indicates the wearer is competent in a style's basic technique and principles. Since in many styles a black belt takes approximately three to six years of training to achieve, a possible analogy might be a bachelor's degree: the student has a good understanding of fundamental concepts and ability, but has not yet perfected their skills. In this analogy a graduate degree would represent advancement past the first degree. Brazilian jiu-jitsu would be a notable exception to this, as a black belt for a jiu-jitsu practitioner typically takes 7–12 years of training to earn, and a black belt holder is generally viewed as an expert in the art.\n\nAnother way to describe this links to the terms used in Japanese arts; shodan (for a first degree black belt), means literally the first/beginning step, and the next grades, nidan and sandan are each numbered as \"ni\" is two and \"san\" is three, meaning second step, third step, etc. The shodan black belt is not the end of training but rather as a beginning to advanced learning: the individual now \"knows how to walk\" and may thus begin the \"journey\".\n\nAs a \"black belt\" is commonly viewed as conferring some status, achieving one has been used as a marketing \"gimmick\", for example a guarantee of being awarded one within a specific period or if a specific amount is paid. Some schools place profit ahead of ability when using these tactics and are sometimes referred to as McDojos or belt factories.\n\nIn some Japanese schools, after obtaining a black belt the student also begins to instruct, and may be referred to as a senpai (senior student) or sensei (teacher). In others, a black belt student should not be called sensei until they are sandan (third degree black belt), or the titles kyosa or sabom in Korean martial arts as second degree or higher, as this denotes a greater degree of experience and a sensei must have this and grasp of what is involved in teaching a martial art.\n\nIn Japanese martial arts the further subdivisions of black belt ranks may be linked to \"dan\" grades and indicated by 'stripes' on the belt. Yūdansha (roughly translating from Japanese to \"person who holds a \"dan\" grade\") is often used to describe those who hold a black belt rank. While the belt remains black, stripes or other insignia may be added to denote seniority, in some arts, very senior grades will wear differently colored belts. In judo and some forms of karate, a sixth dan will wear a red and white belt. The red and white belt is often reserved only for ceremonial occasions, and a regular black belt is still worn during training. At 9th or 10th dan some schools award red. In some schools of Jujutsu, the Shihan rank and higher wear purple belts. These other colors are often still referred to collectively as \"black belts\".\n\n"}

{"id": "898378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=898378", "title": "Hidden ball trick", "text": "Hidden ball trick\n\nA hidden ball trick is a play in which a player deceives the opposing team about the location of the ball. In the game of baseball, the defense deceives the runner about the location of the ball, in an effort to tag out the runner. In -based sports (e.g., American football and lacrosse), the offense deceives the defense about the location of the ball, in attempt to get the defense running the wrong way, such as in a fumblerooski.\n\nIn the game of baseball, the defense deceives the runner about the location of the ball, in an effort to tag out the runner.\nA fielder may employ the hidden ball trick when a runner is on base. Variations of the play exist: they all involve a fielder keeping the baseball without the runner's knowledge, waiting for the runner to lead off of his base, and then quickly tagging the runner out. For the trick to work, the fielder (generally an infielder) must get the ball while the ball is still in play, and the runner must not realize that the fielder has the ball.\n\nVariations of the play usually involve a fielder miming a throw to the pitcher or another defender while keeping the baseball out of sight, often in his glove. If the runner does not detect the deception and realize that the play is still ongoing, he may stray off the base and be tagged out. A related tactic is to quickly re-tag the runner after an unsuccessful tag in the hope that his hand or foot has lost contact with the base after a slide.\n\nIn most situations, the balk rule precludes a pitcher from performing a hidden ball trick. In high school and college baseball, a balk is called (NFHS R6-S2-A5) if a runner or runners are on base and the pitcher, while he is not touching the pitcher's plate, makes any movement naturally associated with his pitch, or he places his feet on or astride the pitcher's plate, or positions himself within approximately five feet of the pitcher's plate without having the ball. In professional baseball, under Rule 8.05(i), a balk occurs if the pitcher is standing on or astride of the pitching rubber without the ball. As play after a foul ball, hit batsman, or time out, must not resume until the pitcher is on the pitcher's mound, the infielder cannot use these times to obtain the ball.\n\nWhile variations exist, use of the play in major league baseball is somewhat rare. Some say that the hidden-ball trick has been pulled fewer than 300 times in over 100 years of major league baseball.\n\nA first baseman may attempt the play after a pitcher, in an attempt to pick off a runner, throws to first. The first baseman then fakes the throw back to the pitcher while keeping the ball in his glove, and if and when the runner leaves the base, tags the runner. Dave Bergman is a former first baseman who pulled this off on multiple occasions. A second baseman could attempt a similar play after a successful steal of second base, having received a throw from the catcher.\n\nFormer second baseman Marty Barrett also successfully performed the trick more than once. After a runner reached second base on a ball hit to the outfield, and after receiving the throw in from the outfield, he faked a throw to the pitcher while retaining the ball. To aid the deception, Barrett took the throw with his back to the runner, then placed the ball between the back of his glove and one of his fingers: this way, he exposed his glove to the runner without the ball in the pocket, suggesting that he did not have the ball. Other players have hidden the ball in their armpit.\n\nFormer third baseman Matt Williams used a different technique. On more than one occasion, he asked the runner to step off the base so that Williams could sweep the dirt off it, then tagged out the runner when the runner complied. This worked twice.\n\nFormer third baseman Mike Lowell also made the trick work twice, each time after a throw in from the outfield. The key to Lowell's success was acting, placement, and waiting: acting as if nothing was on, standing away from the bag but not too far from it, and waiting, at least 10 seconds, until the runner on third took a few steps.\n\nOn June 8, , shortstop Julio Lugo of the Boston Red Sox caught Alberto Callaspo of the Arizona Diamondbacks. However, third baseman Lowell, Lugo's teammate, claimed it was not a true hidden ball trick since the pitcher did most of the work \"selling\" the trick. Before Lugo caught Callaspo, Lowell laid claim to the last successful hidden ball trick and held that position for eight years to the day. Lowell's occurred on August 10, , when he, then with the Florida Marlins, caught the Arizona Diamondbacks Luis Terrero, with reliever Todd Jones on the mound. Lowell also caught Brian Schneider of the Montreal Expos in .\n\nThird baseman Bill Coughlin was reputed to have been the master of the hidden ball trick. Although not verified, Coughlin reportedly pulled it off seven times. The first known recorded and successful example of Coughlin's hidden ball trick was against the Detroit Tigers on September 24, 1901, as seen from a contemporary description of the game:In returning the sphere to the infield the ball was thrown to our tricky third baseman and he promptly did a little sleight-o'-hand work, his hands moving faster than coachers' eyes, and shoved the ball up under his arm and assumed his position as it there were nothing wrong. Carrick was standing in the box as if he were about to toss the globule over, and Cronin eased off the ottoman slightly, but enough to get him caught, and he returned to the bench amids the jeers and howls of the populace.He did it again on September 3, , catching George Stone in the first inning. In Game 2 of the 1907 World Series, Coughlin caught Jimmy Slagle with a hidden ball trick, the only one in World Series history. The play went from Germany Schaefer to Coughlin.\n\nWillie Kamm was considered another master of the trick. On April 30, , in a game against the Cleveland Indians, Kamm was involved in a rare triple play involving a hidden-ball trick. The Indians had baserunners on first and second bases when Carl Lind grounded out to the shortstop. Johnny Hodapp, who had been on second base, tried to score but got caught in a rundown between third and home. Charlie Jamieson advanced to third. Kamm retrieved the ball and tagged both runners, whereupon the umpire ruled Hodapp out. Kamm then hid the ball under his arm and waited for Jamieson to step off the base. When he did so, Kamm tagged him out to complete the triple play.\n\nOn July 12, 2013, San Diego Padres shortstop Everth Cabrera attempted to execute the hidden-ball trick on San Francisco Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval after Sandoval hit a double. As pitcher Sean O'Sullivan walked onto the mound and Sandoval took his lead, Cabrera, while holding the ball, tagged Sandoval. However, Sandoval had requested and was granted time by second base umpire Laz Díaz immediately after his double. Because O'Sullivan never assumed his position on the pitcher's plate with the baseball, the umpires appropriately never called \"Play\" and Cabrera's tag of Sandoval was therefore not legal. The \"Umpire Ejection Fantasy League\" explains this is why a hidden-ball trick may never be executed after a base hit, mound visit, or other event in which \"time\" is called: in order to put the ball back into play, the pitcher must engage the rubber and if the pitcher engages the rubber without the ball, it is a balk pursuant to Rule 8.05(i).\n\nOn August 10, 2013, in a Tampa Bay loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, 5–0, Evan Longoria, Tampa Bay Rays's third baseman pulled the trick in the fourth inning on Juan Uribe. With the bases loaded and no outs, A.J. Ellis flied out to center field, with Andre Ethier tagging to score, Uribe tagging to third and Skip Schumaker tagging to second. Tampa first baseman (and former Dodger) James Loney cut off center fielder Wil Myers' throw at the mound, flipped to shortstop Yunel Escobar, who flipped to third baseman Longoria standing several feet behind third base, out of Uribe's line of sight. Longoria just stood behind the bag looking bored and kicking the dirt for several seconds before he got his chance. \"I was watching it, and I didn't know what to do to stop it\", said pitcher Zack Greinke, who was on deck. \"I didn't want to yell at Uribe, because I might get him off [the bag]. I didn't know what to do. He just lifted his foot for a tenth of a second and Longoria was ready for it. As Uribe shifted his weight and took his foot off the third-base bag, Longoria sneaked from behind and slapped Uribe's thigh with a tag. Longoria looked over his shoulder at umpire Angel Hernández, who called Uribe out for an 8-3-6-5 double play. In an after-the-game stunt from his teammates, Uribe was presented with a baseball shoe taped to a base.\n\nOn September 19, 2013, Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton caught Matt Carpenter of the St. Louis Cardinals for the final out of the first inning in a day game at Coors Field. Helton, who days earlier had announced his retirement after 17 seasons with the Rockies, tagged Carpenter after faking a throw back to pitcher Roy Oswalt following a pickoff attempt. Carpenter was dusting his hands after a head-first slide when he stepped off the back side of first base towards 1B umpire Bill Miller. Cardinals first base coach Chris Maloney was unable to help Carpenter before Helton got him with a poking tag. \"I've been wanting to do that for 17 seasons. Now I can cross that off my bucket list\", said the 40-year-old Helton, who at the time was the oldest active professional athlete in Denver. The Rockies went on to win 7-6 in a 15 inning game that was the second-longest in Coors Field history.\n\nIn the minor leagues, on August 31, 1987, catcher Dave Bresnahan of the Williamsport Bills pulled an unusual hidden ball trick against the Reading Phillies in the Eastern League. With a runner on third base, Bresnahan switched catcher's mitts and put on a glove in which he had secreted a peeled potato. When the pitch came in, Bresnahan fired the white potato down the third-base line, enticing the runner to sprint home. Bresnahan then tagged the runner with the baseball which he kept in his mitt. The umpire awarded the runner home plate for Bresnahan's deception. Bresnahan was banned from the league for the incident, but the fans of the Bills loved the play and the team eventually retired Bresnahan's number.\n\nIn goal-based sports (e.g., American football and lacrosse), the offense deceives the defense about the location of the ball, in attempt to get the defense running the wrong way.\n\nA hidden ball trick is considered a trick play in American football.\nThere are various executions of hidden ball plays in American football, including the Statue of Liberty play and Fumblerooski.\n\nOn November 9, 1895 John Heisman executed a hidden ball trick utilizing quarterback Reynolds Tichenor to get Auburn's only touchdown in a 6 to 9 loss to Vanderbilt. During the play the ball was snapped to a half-back who was able to slip it under the back of the quarterback's jersey and who in turn was able to trot in for the touchdown. This was also the first game in the south decided by a field goal. Heisman later used the trick against Pop Warner's Georgia team. Warner picked up the trick and later used it at Cornell against Penn State in 1897. He then used it in 1903 at Carlisle against Harvard and garnered national attention.\n\nThe hidden ball trick was famously parodied in the 1930s by the Marx Brothers in the film \"Horse Feathers\" and by the Three Stooges in the comedy short \"Three Little Pigskins\".\n\nHidden ball tricks can be used in rugby and lacrosse.\n\n"}

{"id": "1901987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1901987", "title": "Jack Trice Stadium", "text": "Jack Trice Stadium\n\nJack Trice Stadium (originally Cyclone Stadium and formerly Jack Trice Field) is a stadium, in Ames, Iowa, United States. It is primarily used for college football and is the home field of the Iowa State Cyclones. It opened on September 20, 1975, with a 17–12 win over Air Force.\n\nIt is the third-largest stadium by capacity in the Big 12 Conference behind Darrell K. Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium and Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium, and the third-newest in the conference, behind only Milan Puskar Stadium of West Virginia (which had its design based on Jack Trice Stadium) and Baylor's McLane Stadium. Including hillside seats in the corners of the stadium, the facility's official capacity is 61,500. The school announced in May 2014 a planned expansion to 61,500.\n\nThe current record for single-game attendance, 61,500, was set on September 5, 2015, when the Cyclones defeated the University of Northern Iowa 31-7.\n\nJack Trice Stadium replaced Clyde Williams Field, which had been in use from 1914 through 1974. Williams Field was closed in 1975 and razed in 1978, and Martin and Eaton residence halls now stand on the ground.\n\nThe stadium consists of double-decked grandstands running the length of either sideline and encompassing the south end zone. The Richard O. Jacobson Athletic Building, an athletic center built in 1996, is located in the north end zone. The field itself is slightly lower than the surrounding ground. There is a single main concourse for each of the grandstands. A three-level press box on the west side of the stadium was added to the stadium in 1997 for a cost of $6.2 million. Permanent lighting and a large video/scoreboard behind the bleachers in the south end zone were added in 2002. Later in the summer of 2011 a second video/scoreboard was added on the north side. At triple the size of the previous scoreboard, it stands over the Jacobson Athletic Building. Both scoreboards consist of three levels on the inside, with a camera perch on top. The stadium is part of the Iowa State Center, a sports, entertainment and continuing education complex located to the southeast of the university's main campus. North of the stadium is Hilton Coliseum, home to Iowa State Cyclones basketball, wrestling, volleyball and gymnastics teams, as well as other events such as musical festivals, rock concerts and university commencement ceremonies.\n\nIn 1975, the stadium's playing field was named in honor of Jack Trice, Iowa State's first African American athlete and the school's first athlete to die of injuries sustained during a Cyclone athletic competition.\n\nOn October 6, 1923, Trice and his Iowa State College teammates played against the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Because he was African American, on the night of the game, Trice had to stay at a different Minneapolis hotel than his teammates.\n\nDuring the second play of the game, Trice's collarbone was broken. Trice insisted he was all right and returned to the game. In the third quarter, while attempting to tackle a University of Minnesota ball carrier by throwing a roll block, Trice was trampled by three Minnesota players. Although he claimed to be fine, Trice was removed from the game and sent to a Minneapolis hospital. The doctors declared him fit to travel and he returned by train to Ames with his teammates. On October 8, 1923, Trice died from hemorrhaged lungs and internal bleeding as a result of the injuries sustained during the game.\n\nThere was a great deal of speculation surrounding the play that resulted in Jack Trice's death. Many of his teammates claimed after the fact that the Gophers targeted him throughout the first two quarters because of his skin color. ISU teammate Johnny Behm told the Cleveland Plain Dealer in a 1979 interview, \"One person told me that nothing out of the ordinary happened. But another who saw it said it was murder.\" \n\nIowa State dismissed all classes after 3 p.m. on October 9, 1923 in honor of Trice, who wore the number \"37\" in his short career at Iowa State.\n\nTrice's funeral was held at the Iowa State College central campus in Ames on October 16, 1923, with 4,000 students and faculty members in attendance. Before he was buried, his casket was draped in Iowa State's school colors, cardinal and gold.\n\nAs a result of his death, ISU did not renew their contract to play against Minnesota after the 1924 game. They would not play again until 1989.\n\nUntil 1997, the facility itself was known as Cyclone Stadium. Because of persistent requests by the students, the facility was renamed Jack Trice Stadium, making it the only one in Division I FBS named for an African American individual.\n\nJack Trice Stadium was completed in less than two years, from its ground breaking on Oct. 26, 1973, to the first game, a victory over Air Force on Sept. 20, 1975. In late 1973 and spring of 1974, heavy earth-moving equipment shaped the embankments. A huge, movable form shaped the lower decks with thousands of cubic yards of concrete. Originally, the stadium had a capacity of 42,500.\n\n1976<br>\nIn 1976, bleachers were constructed in the end zones to increase the stadium's capacity to more than 46,000 (50,000 with standing room tickets). Before then, all the seating was in the grandstands on the sidelines.\n\n1995–1997<br>\nThe stadium complex was transformed in 1995-96 with the construction of the state-of-the-art $10.6 million Richard O. Jacobson Athletic Building, in the north end-zone of Jack Trice Stadium. The Jacobson Building is the home of Cyclone athletics containing all sport and administrative offices except men's and women's basketball and volleyball. The Ralph A. Olsen Building was also renovated at that time and it sits attached to the north end of the Jacobson Athletic Building. The Olsen Building, named in honor of prominent Ellsworth, Iowa farmer and ISU alumnus, houses the strength and conditioning facilities, the team meeting rooms, and the locker rooms.\n\nIn 1996, a natural grass field and new drainage system made its debut, the field had been AstroTurf since 1975. In 1997, the $6.2 million, three-level press tower located on the west side was added to Jack Trice Stadium. The new press tower includes press and radio-television levels and nine sky box suites.\n\n2002<br>\nThe football atmosphere at Jack Trice Stadium was enhanced with the installation of a new million-dollar videoboard and scoreboard which replace its black and white predecessor. Permanent lighting was also added to the side of the stadium for the 2002 season at a cost of $500,000. Since then, ISU has played twice as many home night games as they did the previous 30 years.\n2007–2009<br>\nBetween the 2007 and 2009 football seasons, Jack Trice received its largest renovation project to date. With the completion of $30 million in renovations, the stadium has 22 new suites, a new wider concourses with new concessions and bathrooms on the east and west side, a new club section, improved disability seating, new fencing and gates, a new plaza near the main entrance, and many preservative renovations throughout the stadium.\n\nThe changes to suites also includes the expansion of two existing suites on the west side of the stadium and the installation of operable windows in all of the current suites. Funding for these renovations came completely from the sale of stadium suites, club seats, increased ticket revenues and fund raising.\n\nRichard O. \"Dick\" Jacobson donated $5 million to ISU athletics in 2008, for the purpose of continuing renovations to Jack Trice Stadium. There will be a Jacobson Plaza constructed near the stadiums main entrance in his honor. This donation was the largest donation ever made to ISU athletics.\n\n2011 <br>\nA new video/scoreboard was installed on the north end of Jack Trice Stadium. The screen measures 36 feet high and 79.5 feet wide and has a resolution of 720 x 1,584. The new video board was completed for the 2011 football season.\n\n2015<br>\n\nOn May 1, 2008, ISU Athletic Department was given permission from the Iowa Board of Regents to continue planning and fund raising for the Jack Trice Expansion. On November 25, 2013 it was announced that the Reiman family would donate $25 million to help complete the south end-zone project estimated at $60 million. Iowa State Athletics gained approval from the Iowa Board of Regents for the construction of the south end-zone final phase on February 6, 2014. Athletic Director Jamie Pollard has stated the target date of the south end-zone project was to complete the expansion before the start of the 2015 football season. This expansion brought capacity from 54,800 to 61,500.\n\nThis south end-zone addition included enclosing the south end zone, which included an upper deck, and connected the east side concourse to the west side concourse. Originally, the south end-zone project was scheduled to be completed at the same time as the east concourse renovation; however, funding was not secured for the south end-zone expansion, so the two projects were completed separately.\n\nOn a call in show, ISU athletic director stated that more facility improvements will be continuing over the next few years. Iowa State's head football coach Paul Rhoads has also made similar comments. The $20.6 million Bergstrom football complex, a state-of-the-art training facility was built between the indoor practice facility and the Jacobson building with opening and dedication in 2012.\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that Iowa State would enclose their south end zone. This brought capacity to 61,500 including a lower bowl seating 7,500 and an upper bowl seating 5,800. Included in the lower bowl is a two-story, 40,000 square foot premium club with seating for more than 3,000.\n\nPlans are underway to renovate the Jacobsen Building, demolish the Olsen Building and expand/renovate the Bergstrom Football Complex. The plans include a multi-story building situated between the Jacobsen Building and the Bergstrom Football Complex, including a new football locker room, academic center, dining center, and Olympic sports locker rooms.\n\nListed are the top ten largest crowds in the stadium's history.\n\nListed are the wins by Iowa State over Top 25 teams at Jack Trice Stadium.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "293861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293861", "title": "Motorsport", "text": "Motorsport\n\nMotorsport or motor sport is a global term used to encompass the group of competitive sporting events which primarily involve the use of motorised vehicles, whether for racing or non-racing competition. The terminology can also be used to describe forms of competition of two-wheeled motorised vehicles under the banner of motorcycle racing, and includes off-road racing such as motocross.\n\nFour- (or more) wheeled motorsport competition is globally governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA); and the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) governs two-wheeled competition.\n\nIn 1894, a French newspaper organised a race from Paris to Rouen and back, starting city to city racing. In 1900, the Gordon Bennett Cup was established. Closed circuit racing arose as open road racing, on public roads, was banned. Brooklands was the first dedicated motor racing track in the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing World War I, European countries organised Grand Prix races over closed courses. In the United States, dirt track racing became popular.\n\nAfter World War II, the Grand Prix circuit became more formally organised. In the United States, stock car racing and drag racing became firmly established.\n\nMotorsports ultimately became divided by types of motor vehicles into racing events, and their appropriate organisations.\n\nMotor racing is the subset of motorsport activities which involve competitors racing against each other.\nThe Red Bull RB8, the 2012 Formula One World Championship winning car\n\nFormula racing is a set of classes of motor vehicles, with their wheels outside, and not contained by, any bodywork of their vehicle. These have been globally classified as specific 'Formula' series - the most common being Formula One, and many others include the likes of Formula 3, Formula Ford, Formula Renault and Formula Palmer Audi. However, in North America, the IndyCar series is their pinnacle open-wheeled racing series. More recently, new open-wheeled series have been created, originating in Europe, which omit the 'Formula' moniker, such as GP2 and GP3. Former 'Formula' series include Formula 5000 and Formula Two.\n\nFormula One is a class of single-seat and open-wheel grand prix closed course racing, governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), and currently organized by the privately owned company Formula One Group. The formula regulations contain a very strict set of rules which govern vehicle power, weight and size.\n\nFormula E is a class of open-wheel auto racing that uses only electric-powered cars. The series was conceived in 2012, and the inaugural championship started in Beijing on 13 September 2014. The series is also sanctioned by the FIA and races a spec chassis/battery combination with manufacturers allowed to develop their own electric power-trains. The series has gained significant traction in recent years.\n\nA series originated on June 12th, 1909 in Portland, Oregon at its first race. Shortly after, Indianapolis Motor Speedway opened in 1909 and held races that ranged from 50-200 miles. Its premier race is the Indianapolis 500 which began on May 11th, 1911 and a tradition was born. Today, Indycar operates a full schedule with over 20 teams and 40 different drivers. The current schedule includes 14 tracks over the course of 17 races per season . Josef Newgarden was crowned current champion of the Indycar Series at Sonoma Raceway on September 17th, 2017 in Sonoma, California.\n\nEnclosed wheel racing is a set of classes of vehicles, where the wheels are primarily enclosed inside the bodywork of the vehicle, similar to a North American 'stock car'.\n\nSports car racing is a set of classes of vehicles, over a closed course track, including sports cars, and specialised racing types. The premiere race is the 24 Hours of Le Mans which takes place annually in France during the month of June. Sports car racing rules and specifications differentiate in North America from established international sanctioning bodies.\n\nStock car racing is a set of vehicles, that race over a speedway track, organized by NASCAR. While once stock cars, the vehicles are now purpose built, but resemble the body design and shape of production cars. Bootleggers throughout the Carolinas are often credited for the origins of NASCAR due to the resistance during the prohibition. Many of the vehicles were modified to increase top speed and handling, to provide the bootleggers with an advantage toward the vehicles local law enforcement would use in the area. An important part to the modifications of stock cars, was to increase the performance of the vehicle while also maintaining the same exterior look giving it the name Stock car racing. Many legends in NASCAR originated as bootleggers in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina like Junior Johnson. Organized oval racing began on Daytona Beach in Florida as a hobby but quickly gained interest from all over the country. As oval racing became larger and larger, a group gathered in hopes to form a sanctioning body for the sport. NASCAR was organized in 1947, to combine flat track oval racing of production cars. Daytona Beach and Road Course was founded where land speed records were set on the beach, and including part of A1A. The highlight of the stock car calendar is the season-opening Daytona 500, also nicknamed 'The Great American Race' which is held at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. NASCAR has now held over 2,500 sanctioned events over the course of 70 seasons. Richard Petty is known as the king of NASCAR with over 200 recorded wins in the series and has competed in 1,184 races in his career.\n\nTouring car racing is a set of vehicles, modified street cars, that race over closed purpose built race tracks and street courses.\n\nOff-Road Racing is a group of vehicles that specialize in off-road racing and are modified street cars that can race on close purpose built off-road tracks and courses. Off-Road racing is popular in areas like California and Arizona. Premier off-road events in the United States include the Baja 1000 which takes place in the Baja California Peninsula and endures nearly 1000 miles of racing on a closed and pre-designed Baja Truck course. Series like the National Off-Road Racing Association (NORRA) utilize off-road vehicles which was founded in 1967 to sanction events through the Baja Desert. The first event sanctioned by the organization was the 1967 Mexican 1000 rally that began in Tijuana and ended in La Paz.\n\nMotor sports which involve competitors racing against each other include:\n\nForms of motorsport which do not involve racing include drifting, demolition derby, regularity rally, motorcycle trials, gymkhana, Freestyle Motocross and tractor pulling.\n\nMotorsport was a demonstration event at the 1900 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n"}

It was included in the 1951 revival of the Cotswold Olimpick Games, and remains one of its most popular events, run as the World Shin-kicking Championships. The event now draws crowds of thousands of spectators.\n\nDuring each round, the combatants face each other and hold on to each other's collar. Traditionally (in the Cotswold Olimpicks) they wear white coats, representing shepherds' smocks. They typically attempt to strike their opponent's shin with the inside of the foot as well as their toes. Success in the event requires both agility and the ability to endure pain, the loser crying out \"sufficient\" when he has had enough. The matches are observed by a referee, or stickler, who determines the score of the match. Modern competitions are won by the combatant who wins two out of three against his competitor.\n\nLegend has it that some shin-kickers wore steel-toe boots during the competitions and tried to build pain tolerance by hitting their shins with hammers. In modern competitions the combatants are required to wear soft shoes and stuff their trouser legs with straw for padding. Ambulance crews also attend the events in case of injury.\n"}

The centre was officially opened by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on 9 October 2012.\n\nThe purpose of the centre is to be the base for all coaching and development work undertaken by the FA, and to be the training and preparation ground for all 28 of the England national football teams at the same time, including disability, futsal and those who compete in UEFA and FIFA competitions such as:\n\nOriginally part of Needwood Forest, the hunting grounds were developed by the Berkeley family in the 13th century. After passing into the hands of the crown, in the 1700s the lease again became owned by private individuals. Passing to the Bass family in 1850, the country house was redeveloped in the 1870s, after which an extensive horse racing stud was developed. After the death of Sir William Bass, 2nd Baronet in 1952, the estate was sold off and the house demolished.\n\nBefore the proposed development, the FA had two streams of development facility:\n\nFollowing research by FA technical director Howard Wilkinson, the FA bought the site for £2m in 2001 from the Forte Hotels division of Granada Leisure plc.\n\nHaving researched all existing National Football Centres, Wilkinson's project was based on the French system located at Clairefontaine near Paris, which nurtured the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship winners. Projected to cost £30m and proposed to open in 2003, located near the geographical heart of England it would provide the base for Wilkinson and the FA coaching staff to look for and develop the future generations of England stars. The centre's facilities would include 14 pitches, and provide facilities and headquarters from national teams from the age of 14 upwards.\n\nFollowing the departure of FA Chief Executive Adam Crozier, the FA reviewed their plans in November 2002. Due to escalating costs at Wembley Stadium, the FA were expected to place an additional £100m into that project. On review, the costs of the national football centre were also revised upwards to £80m. As a result, although the plans were approved, the deadline was relaxed to allow for the difficult financing circumstances.\n\nIn 2003 it was decided to mothball the project; in 2004 a proposal to drop the project was delayed until spring 2005. In September 2006 the FA board agreed not to invest any further funds into the site until a decision was made on how to proceed, with all options from a sale, to development with partners, open to discussion. Pitches had already been laid, but construction work on the outbuildings and dressing rooms had not started.\n\nAfter the project was finally approved in 2008, SGP was designed by Red Box Design Group, who also designed the Sunderland Aquatic Centre, Sunderland Football Club's Academy of Light and Durham County Cricket Club's Riverside Ground. The centre has 12 world-class training pitches, with both grass and artificial surfaces, one of which is an exact replica of the surface used at Wembley Stadium, and a full-sized indoor pitch. It also has state-of-the-art hydrotherapy suites, biomechanics and training gyms, video analysis amenities, educational and coaching suites and medical and sport science facilities.\n\nThe site's hotel facilities are managed by Hilton Hotels group, its first site where two of its brands are co-located. The hotels are used by members of the various football teams when they are in residence.\n\nThe sports, assessment and medical facilities are all available for hire by sports teams or commercial ventures.\nBetween 2001 and January 2010 the project cost £105m, with the FA contributing £25m. In September 2012 it was announced that SGP would be sponsored by Nike as part of a new deal with the England team starting in 2013.\n\nThe project's chairman, David Sheepshanks, said: \"Our aim is to make St George's Park a sporting destination of choice for coaches, players, administrators and officials\".\n\nThe intention is that it will be the training base for 24 England teams. It will act as the focal point for the FA's coaching and player development work. The national football centre will also include offices for the FA's technical experts and accommodation for 300 and sports science and medicine facilities. The League Managers Association committed itself to making the new centre their future headquarters.\n\nFormer European Cup winners Steaua Bucharest have enjoyed the facilities of the St George's Park for their pre-season 2013-14 training camp. Galatasaray and AS Monaco also used it to train in the summer of 2013. In March 2014 US NASL team Minnesota United FC trained at the facility.\n\nIn 2018 it hosted five matches in the group stages of the European Under-17 Championships.\n\nIt has been said that the facility is unnecessary; in 2010 Sam Wallace, a football journalist for \"The Independent\" wrote: \"The problem for the FA is that as long as it sits there unfinished, Burton is a stick which the FA's critics use to beat it.\" Work had been halted on the project in 2004 as the FA focussed its financial efforts on the building of the new Wembley Stadium. In early 2008 the plans were resurrected, with Trevor Brooking calling for the project to be finished by 2010, stating that without a national football centre \"the England coach's job will get that much harder.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2938464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2938464", "title": "Twitch gameplay", "text": "Twitch gameplay\n\nTwitch gameplay is a type of video gameplay scenario that tests a player's response time. Action games such as shooters, sports and fighting games often contain elements of twitch gameplay. For example, first-person shooters such as \"Counter-Strike\" as well as \"Call of Duty\" shooters require quick reaction times for the players to shoot enemies, and fighting games such as \"Street Fighter\" require quick reaction times to attack or counter an opponent. Other video game genres may also involve twitch gameplay. For example, the puzzle video game \"Tetris\" gradually speeds up as the player makes progress.\n\nTwitch gameplay keeps players actively engaged with quick feedback to their actions, as opposed to turn-based gaming that involves waiting for the outcome of a chosen course of action. Twitch can be used to expand tactical options and play by testing the skill of the player in various areas (usually reflexive responses) and generally add difficulty (relating to the intensity of \"twitching\" required).\n\nFast chess, chess played with short time limits between moves, is an example of adding a twitch gameplay element to a turn-based game. Conversely, checkpoints and extra lives are common game mechanics in twitch gaming that attempt to reduce the penalty for errors in play, adding an element of turn-based gameplay. Traditionally, however, the term \"twitch game\" has been applied to simple arcade, console, and computer games that lack an element of strategy and are based solely upon a player's reaction time.\n\n\"Twitch\" refers to the motion the player makes, a sudden movement or reaction to an event on the screen. An early use of the term was by Vern Raburn of Microsoft in 1981. Most early computer, arcade, and console games are considered to be \"twitch games.\" They mostly involved \"see and react\" situations. For instance, \"Kaboom!\" had players rapidly catching bombs that a mad bomber threw from a rooftop. Most classic arcade games such as \"Space Invaders\" and \"Pac-Man\" were also twitch-based.\n\nAs games and their control inputs evolved, the games started to favor strategy over reaction, early turn-based games being the most prevalent examples. Such games required players to plan each move and anticipate the opponent's moves ahead of time. Not unlike chess, early strategy games focused on setting pieces and then moving them one turn at a time while the opponent did the same. Many of these games were based on tabletop games. The introduction of the internet, and its suitability as a playable medium, facilitated many of the features of today's mainstream games.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that all games with a base in strategy do not include room for twitch gameplay. Soon after turn-based strategy games were introduced, real-time strategy games were introduced to the video gaming market, beginning with \"Herzog Zwei\" and then \"Dune II\" and eventually leading to popular titles such as \"Command & Conquer\", \"Warcraft\", and \"StarCraft\". While strategy was still the primary objective, these games played out in real time. Players were required to have fast reactions to enemies' movements and attacks.\n\nEarly first-person shooters were very much like early games in general; fast reactions were required and little strategy or thought went into the gameplay. Even the youngest players were able to understand the concept, which may have been the reason such games became instantly popular among a large demographic. Many of the earliest first person games were considered cookie cutter copies of each other; \"Doom\", \"Wolfenstein 3D\", and many others looked, played, and felt the same, especially since many shooters were built off the \"Doom\" engine. Enemy AI was predictable and levels were simple mazes with secrets and side rooms. While some games included the ability to look up and down, it was rarely required of the player.\n\nGames have become more complex as technology has improved. Today, nearly every genre of video game contains some level of \"twitch\", though turn-based strategy games have remained roughly untouched by the phenomenon. First-person shooters remain the predominant genre to emphasize twitch gameplay.\n\nSome games include elements that take players back in nostalgic gameplay in the form of quick time events or QTEs. These events decide the fate of the player by displaying a keystroke or keystrokes that the player must input quickly. While the concept is not new, the term is often attributed to Yu Suzuki, director of the game \"Shenmue\". \"Shenmue\" was an adventure game at its core and it introduced QTEs as a way to keep players interested during extended cut scenes. Other games have since adopted this method (e.g. \"Resident Evil 4\").\n\nEarly shooter games were two-dimensional, such as the shoot 'em up \"Space Invaders\", though some had the guise of being three-dimensional, such as the rail shooter \"Space Harrier\". Players operated on a single level with enemies, and with the introduction of three-dimensional environments along with enhanced graphics and network capability, shooters continued to be a major influence in the gaming world. The overall tactics and strategies remained the same. Games such as \"Quake\" encouraged fast-paced destruction. Automatic weapons and rocket launchers ensured quick gameplay. It was still a \"twitch game,\" but over time, gameplay success was determined by more than merely having the fastest reactions. As games evolved, additional layers of strategy were demanded. Over time, strategy won over twitch, especially in team- and objective-based games.\n\nA primary example of this would be the game \"Counter-Strike\" – originally a modification of the popular game \"Half-Life\" that quickly became one of the most popular competitive first-person shooters to date. The base game included objective-based game types that limited the player to a single life per round. Players obtained in-game cash to purchase better weapons and armor. Twitch became a scenario-based event as players wanted to retain the weapons they had worked hard to purchase, knowing a death resulted in losing all the equipment they had obtained.\n\nMany players realized that teamwork and strategy would win over the \"run and gun\" tactic. Twitching became something that happened in moments of need versus all the time; for example, a player might have walked around a corner and found an enemy there, in which one would have to react immediately to kill the opponent.\n\nWith further advancement in technology and improvement of the artificial intelligence of computer-controlled enemies, games became more and more about strategy in the shooter genre. A player had to be able to aim precisely to conserve ammo, and often flank large groups of enemies.\n\nToday's shooters still have scenarios where players will have a twitch reaction, but often even those scenarios can be avoided by taking one's time.\n\nEven highly skilled gamers still find themselves in twitch scenarios in shooters. Most are predominantly online, where the actions of the enemy team are unscripted and difficult to predict. Many skilled snipers in these games find themselves \"twitching\" when flanked; the instinctual reaction is for one to switch to a secondary weapon, which is most often an inaccurate handgun, and spray fire while attempting to find cover.\n\nThe predominant reason that shooters do not limit the effectiveness of twitch scenarios is because the average gamer has little time to actually play the game, especially if they play in online lobbies, with the amount of time the average gamer has to play games limited to between two and four hours per day. A game that requires a large amount of skill may deter these gamers from playing at all. At the same time, due to the popularity of the internet, there is a large number of gamers who favor twitch (skill) over strategy. In recent years, videos have appeared across the internet displaying montages of twitch in-game kills. Most of these depict players with sniper rifles hardly aiming or not even aiming at all and getting such kills.\n\nTraditional 2D shooters have survived in the form of bullet hell shooters, which place a strong emphasis on quick reaction times.\n\n"}

{"id": "4854120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4854120", "title": "Withers Stakes", "text": "Withers Stakes\n\nThe Withers Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-olds willing to compete one and one-sixteenth mile on the dirt. Held at Aqueduct Racetrack in February, it is a Grade III event, and currently offers a purse of $250,000. \n\nThe Withers was named for David Dunham Withers (1821–1892), an important owner/breeder who won this race in 1890 with his colt, King Eric.\n\nThe inaugural run of the Withers Stakes occurred in 1874 at Jerome Park Racetrack. It was raced there through 1889 after which it was hosted by the Morris Park Racecourse from 1890 through 1904, then Jamaica Racetrack in 1956, and at Belmont Park from 1957 through 1959 and 1984 through 1996. The Withers was not run in 1911 and 1912 due to a New York State legislated ban on all forms of wagering on horses. It was also not run in 2011, but returned to the New York racing calendar on February 4, 2012.\n\nThe Withers was historically run at a distance of one mile but was lengthened to miles in 2012. In 1956, it was also contested at a mile and a sixteenth. The \"Withers Mile\", as it was known to racetrackers, was once one of America's great races, on par with events like England's St.James Palace Stakes (Group 1) (3yo Entire Colts) and France's Prix Jacques Le Marois (Group 1) (3yo Entire Colts and Fillies). Winners included outstanding sires like Dr. Fager, Jaipur, Hagley, Bold Reasoning, Hill Prince, Polynesian, Menow, and Blue Larkspur. In 1919, Sir Barton won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, then won the Withers before winning the Belmont Stakes to complete the Triple Crown. Count Fleet repeated this feat in 1945. Other famous winners of the race include Man o' War and Native Dancer.\n\nThe Withers is now run in February on Aqueduct's inner track as a prep race on the Road to the Kentucky Derby. Prior to 2012, it was run in May at Belmont Park. \n\nSpeed record:\n\nMost wins by a jockey:\n\nMost wins by a trainer:\n\nMost wins by an owner:\n\n\n"}
