It was originally formed in 1905 as the 'Australian Board of Control for International Cricket'. It is incorporated as an Australian Public Company, limited by guarantee.\n\nCricket Australia operates all of the Australian national representative cricket sides, including the Australian cricket team, the Australia national women's cricket team and youth sides as well. CA is also responsible for organising and hosting Test tours and one day internationals with other nations, and scheduling the home international fixtures.\n\nCricket Australia is an administrative organisation responsible for cricket in Australia. Cricket Australia has six member organisations that represent each of the Australian states. These organisations are:\n\n\nCricket ACT and Northern Territory Cricket are non-member associations, although the ACT participates in Cricket Australia tournaments such as the Women's National Cricket League and the Futures League, and previously briefly also competed in the domestic limited-overs competition.\n\nCricket Australia is governed by eight independent directors, who work collectively in the national interest of Australian cricket. The chief executive officer reports to the board of directors.\n\nEach of the state cricket associations that are members of Cricket Australia also selects a representative side to participate in Australia's major domestic cricket tournaments.\n\nCricket Australia also maintains a healthy but independent association with the Australian Cricketers' Association to provide proper player's rights and welfare requirements.\n\nThe first centralised authority for the administration of cricket in Australia was established in 1892 when representatives from the state associations of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria came together to establish the Australasian Cricket Council. However the Australasian Cricket Council was disbanded in 1898, and what is now known as Cricket Australia was established in 1905 as the \"Australian Board of Control for International Cricket\". Before its establishment, tours by Australian teams to England were organised and funded by private groups or by the players themselves. Similarly, invitations to English teams were made by private promoters or by individual clubs, such as the Melbourne Cricket Club. The predecessor organisation, the Australasian Cricket Council, had existed from 1892 to 1898 but was ineffective due to a lack of funding. Its one lasting action was to establish the Sheffield Shield, the first-class cricket competition between the Australian colonies.\n\nThese early tours were lucrative for the players and promoters and cricket administrators looked to find ways to channel some of this money to the destitute clubs, through the state associations. Formal discussions began in January 1905 in Sydney for the formation of a body to take control of tours from the players. A draft constitution was discussed by members of the New South Wales, Victoria, South Australian and Queensland associations. The first meeting of the new board was held at Wesley College in Melbourne on 6 May 1905.\n\nThe foundation members were the New South Wales Cricket Association and the Victorian Cricket Association. South Australia's delegates refused to join the Board because the Board structure denied the players any representation. The Queensland Cricket Association was represented as an observer only.\n\nQueensland did decide to formally join the association with one delegate member the following year, and the constitution was amended in 1906, so that New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria would each have three permanent representatives, and Queensland one representative. In 1907 Tasmania was also permitted to send a single representative, and Western Australia did likewise in 1913. Changes to this structure were made in 1914 and 1974 respectively when Queensland and Western Australia formally increased their representation to two each.\n\nCricket Australia has had three different names since its foundation. They are:\n\n\nThe organisation's revenue was A$380.9 million in the year ended 30 June 2015, with a net surplus of $99 million largely attributed to the success of co-hosting the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup.\n\nAs well as responsibility for Australian international sides, Cricket Australia organises domestic inter-state cricket in Australia, including the three premier competitions in each of the major forms of the game. These are the Sheffield Shield in first-class cricket, the JLT One-Day Cup, which is the domestic one-day competition, and the KFC Big Bash League, which is the domestic Twenty20 competition.\n\nCricket Australia's competitions:\n\n\nCricket Australia also runs the Under 19 and Under 17 Male Championships, the Under 18 and Under 15 Female National Championships, the National Indigenous Cricket Championships and the National Cricket Inclusion Championships.\n\nCricket Australia also provides awards for various categories of players, including:\n\nCricket Australia also honours players for exceptional service to the game of cricket in Australia by annually adding former players of great distinction to the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\nThe National Selection Panel is the part of Cricket Australia responsible for team selections for each of the Australian national sides in every form of cricket.\n\nThe current four-man panel for the Australian men's sides is: Trevor Hohns (interim chairman), Justin Langer, Mark Waugh and Greg Chappell (interim selector).\n\nThe current four-person panel for the Australia women's sides is: Shawn Flegler, Matthew Mott (head coach), Avril Fahey and Julie Hayes.\n\nCricket Australia is governed by eight independent directors, who work collectively in the national interest of Australian cricket.\n\nThe chief executive officer reports to the board of directors.

It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the University of Toledo Rockets. It is located on the school's Bancroft campus, just south of the banks of the Ottawa River. Known for its blend of old and new, it retains the traditional stonework around the field throughout all its expansions.\n\nOriginally known as University Stadium, it was completed in 1937 at a cost of only $313,558 as a Works Progress Administration project. Originally the natural seating bowl held 8,000 in two sideline grandstands. There was a grass hill at the south end of the stadium, and at the open (north) end of the bowl were two stone towers (still standing), that served as makeshift housing for the football team in its early years. Following World War II, the stadium was renovated, with many glass elements. Because of this, and the city's concentration on the industry, the stadium was renamed the Glass Bowl in 1946. South end zone stands were added in 1966, and further expansion came following Toledo's 35-game win streak from 1969 to 1971, bringing capacity up to 18,500.\n\nIn 1999, the Toledo-based Ohio Cannon of the Regional Football League played at various stadiums, including the Glass Bowl, but did not finish the season.\n\nThe stadium hosted the 2001 MAC Championship Game.\n\nIn 1990, the stadium had its largest expansion take place, adding a second level of seats to both sidelines. As part of the $18.5 million dollar renovations, a three-story press box, 45 luxury suites, a 400-seat Stadium Club, sports information offices, and the Larimer Athletic Complex were built. The three-story press box, the second largest in the nation, was the greatest improvement in terms of upgrades, as the former press box was barely 30 feet long and could only hold approximately 50 people.\n\nFurther improvements include a video scoreboard in the north end zone in 1999, and the upgrade to a Field Turf playing surface in 2008. A new video board was installed in 2010.\n\nIn 2016, a $3.5 million dollar renovation took place, including replacement of the field turf, changes to the facade, updating concessions, restrooms, locker rooms, and ticket booths, as well as other minor cosmetic changes to the stadium.\n\nThe largest crowd in Glass Bowl history for a University of Toledo football game was 36,852 for a game against the United States Naval Academy on October 27, 2001.\n\n\nIn 1961, the University of Toledo procured a genuine rocket from the U.S. Army missile program. The one-ton rocket, which sits outside the Glass Bowl — aimed to hit the 50-yard line of arch-rival Bowling Green's Doyt Perry Stadium — carries two sets of fins and a propellant booster capable of guiding the missile to supersonic velocity. (source NCAA WIKI)\n\nThe Glass Bowl is often used by the Glassmen as a rehearsal facility during weekends in the late spring and early summer. In addition, the Glass Bowl is used for monster truck rallies, commencements, and concerts, among other uses.\n\n\n\n"}

The net player then indicates, (privately); typically with their hands behind their back which side of the court they will move to as the return of serve is hit. These hand gestures let the server at the baseline know which side of the court they are to serve to, and than move to. For intermediate players such as league, or club players it is recommended that the server head to the opposite side to which the net player is headed so that maximum court coverage is obtained) Advanced competitors such as professional; and tour players are known to use other combinations for example Australian Doubles which deliberately exposes one side of the court to entice the return of serve be hit into the open space.\n\nThe ultimate aim here is for the net player to cut off the return of serve hopefully ending the point.\n\nWhy I-formation is Effective\nIn tennis you want to keep the ball away from the net player, because it is easy to put the ball away from closer to the net than any other position on the court.\n\nThis tactic has the player returning the serve guess as to which side the opponents net player will be. So basically there is a 50–50 chance the person returning the server is going to hit the ball right into their opponents net player which effectively can be the worst place to return the serve in doubles.\n\nTips \nTo play this tactic successfully It's important players be comfortable serving the ball with enough precision to place the ball out wide, into the body; and down the 'T\" in each service box. Accuracy is also required so you don't hit the net-player in the back or head.\n\nAnother key to success with this tactic is understanding the ins and outs of returning a serve, and what is involved when choosing to hit down the line as opposed to a crosscourt return. For example, it is harder to change the direction of the ball when it is travelling quickly. Also, there is a higher margin of error when hitting the ball crosscourt, because the distance between the net and the baseline is longer and the net is lower in the centre where the ball path crosses the net.\n\nIt helps to know your opponent's weaknesses and strengths before playing this strategy; so if your opponent has a whopping big crosscourt return of serve, this is good to know beforehand; because you can force them to return the ball down the line where the net is higher, the distance is shorter and the angle is harder; this can intimidating the player returning the serve into making an error.\n\nThe net-player is required to get low, and it is important that they be able to move quickly out of this position, so it's recommended the net player be on their feet, crouching, as opposed to one or both knees. Also, it is easier to move to the ball from the balls of the feet as opposed to being flat-footed. Also typically you want this position to be uncomfortable because you are going to want to move out of it quickly. \n\nOften the net player will put their hands behind the back to indicate where the server should serve. So if the server is serving on the deuce side of the court the index finger is used to point to the ad side, The middle finger is used to indicate a to-the-body shot, and the pinkie finger is used to reflect the down-the-line position. The net-player then communicates if they are going to move to the ad or deuce service-box. It's also common for the net-player to walk back to the service line and whisper his/her choice of combinations to the server; this helps to slow the game down, which can frustrate the returning team's rhythm; and also helps the server to stay calm.\n\nAntoun, A.

Inbuan is said to have originated in the village of Dungtlang in 1750. It was recognized as a sport after the Mizo people migrated from Burma to the Lushai Hills.\n\nInbuan involves very strict rules prohibiting kicking, stepping out of the circle and even bending of the knees. The contest is held in a circle 15–16 feet in diameter on carpet or grass. The objective is to lift one's opponent off his feet while strictly adhering to the rules. The matches are held in three rounds each of 30–60 seconds of duration, the match generally continues till a wrestler either breaks a rule or is lifted off his feet.\n\nAnother feature of this form of wrestling is the catch-hold belt worn by the wrestlers around the waist. It has to remain tight all through the match.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2720704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2720704", "title": "Journeyman (sports)", "text": "Journeyman (sports)\n\nIn American English, a journeyman or journeywoman is an athlete who is technically competent but unable to excel. The term is used elsewhere (such as in British and Australian contexts) to refer to a professional sportsman who plays for a large number of different clubs during their career. In Britain, the term is also used derogatorily, along with \"mercenary\", to refer to players who join various affluent clubs purely in search of higher contractual payouts rather than to further their career; usually clubs which they would likely never join otherwise.\nJourneymen players are usually distinguished from an elite or \"star\" player. Quirk and Fort note that the concerns of journeymen players and superstars, with respect to contract and other negotiations, differ: Superstars are concerned with the preservation of their rights to be free agents, whilst journeymen players are concerned with issues such as league minimum salaries and player pensions. Fort observes that this leads to conflicts between journeymen and superstars, such as (Fort's example) the 1995 attempt by a group of superstar players to derail the agreement between the NBA and its players' association. Holt and Mason note that in football, golf, flat racing, snooker, cricket, and other sports there is a clear distinction in earnings between the few rich stars in each sport and the journeyman professionals. They state that snooker has \"an élite of perhaps twenty players\" and point to a distinction between high earning test cricketers with six figure wages and \"the average county professional\" (for whom they give Simon Hughes, who earned £50,000 in the whole of his twelve years in county cricket, as an example). Vamplew describes how league cricket in the 1890s provided little attraction for star cricketers but was greatly attractive to journeymen players in county cricket, eventually forcing the counties to raise their conventional maximum wage, offer winter pay to more players, and expand the fixture lists.\n\nO'Leary notes as significant the fact that whilst star football players will be treated with lenience by clubs, for journeyman footballers the taking of recreational drugs usually terminates their careers. (He gives Roger Stanislaus and Craig Whitington as examples.) Clubs will regard it as worthwhile to wait for stars to become available for team selection after suspension or imprisonment, but not for journeymen.\n\nThe journeyman can, however, be quite valuable in the team sports context. Because it is almost always economically non-viable for even the richest teams in sports without salary caps to have a roster made up fully of superstar players and because such a scenario would likely not occur even with economic viability because of the lack of attention some players would end up getting, journeymen often make up a large part of a team. This is especially true in the context of baseball, where journeymen often make up large parts of a team's pitching staff and contribute crucially to a team's success. Many journeymen can be highly experienced, and they often play a \"utility\" role to cover for injuries or tactical changes as required.\n\nThe term is also used in this context for boxing journeymen.\n\nIn British English, a journeyman is a player who has represented many different clubs over his career. Prime examples from association football are: German goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstiel, who represented 27 different clubs, and he is currently the only athlete to have played professionally in all six FIFA Confederations; Trevor Benjamin, who has represented 29 different clubs since 1995; Drewe Broughton, who has made 18 transfers in his career; John Burridge, who played for 29 different clubs in a career spanning almost 30 years; there is Jefferson Louis who, since the 1990s, has represented 34 clubs and Dominica once; and his cousin Richard Pacquette who boasts 19 different clubs and even international honours in 10 seasons. The term is also used in Australian English in the same context.\n\nThe term is also used derogatorily, along with \"mercenary\", to refer to players who join various affluent clubs purely in search of higher contractual payouts, clubs which they would likely never join otherwise.\n\nThere is no convention for the number of transfers required for a player to be considered a journeyman or a mercenary and as such is an arbitrary epithet given by those who resent the player's actions. Journeymen's direct opposite, players who play for the same club, or only a few different clubs, throughout their entire careers, are called one-club men.\n\n\n"}

He's a fun-loving guy who is delighted to learn that Hollywood star Pepita Zorita is at today's game, selling kisses for charity. Wacky promptly borrows money from team publicity man Updyke to buy $300 worth.\n\nIn the grandstand, catcher Hippo Jones's wife Hazel and the other women are concerned. Wacky is the best pitcher in baseball when he concentrates on what he's doing, but whenever a pretty girl turns his head, a distracted Wacky suddenly can't throw the ball over the plate. The wives want the Sox to be in the World Series so their husbands will receive bonus money.\n\nSure enough, Wacky's infatuation with Pepita begins a run of bad luck for him and the Sox at the ballpark. On the train, the wives protest until Wacky discloses that he and Pepita secretly ran off to get married.

American Legion and local high school games are also played at the field.\n\nBy 2004, the old stadium that used to sit on the same lot, McDermott Field, was outdated, deteriorating, and viewed as an unsuitable baseball venue. In May of that year, the Chukars approached the City of Idaho Falls about a major renovation; the estimated cost was $3.35 million. After the city agreed to allocate $2 million toward the project, the Chukars started a \"Step Up To The Plate\" fundraising campaign to come up with the remaining $1.35 million. Despite a fundraising campaign launched by the city of Idaho Falls, a sharp rise in anticipated construction costs resulted in a budget shortfall of half a million dollars. Idaho Falls multi-level marketing company Melaleuca provided $600,000 to complete the construction and the stadium was renamed Melaleuca Field on June 22, 2007.\n\nThe old McDermott Field stadium was torn down on October 30, 2006, and the new Melaleuca Field stadium was dedicated on June 22, 2007.

{"id": "3012670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3012670", "title": "Memorial Stadium (Bristol)", "text": "Memorial Stadium (Bristol)\n\nThe Memorial Stadium, also commonly known by its previous name of the Memorial Ground, is a sports ground in Bristol, England. It opened in 1921 dedicated to the memory of local rugby union players killed during the First World War, and was the home of Bristol Bears until they moved to Ashton Gate in 2014. It is currently the home stadium of Bristol Rovers F.C., who moved there in 1996.\n\nThe site was created on an area of land called Buffalo Bill's Field, after Colonel William \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody's Wild West Show was held there between 28 September and 3 October 1891. Two years later in September 1893 Clifton RFC played on the site for the first time.\n\nDuring the First World War the site was converted into allotments but after the war Buffalo Bill's Field was bought by Sir Francis Nicholas Cowlin (then the Sheriff of Bristol) and given to Bristol Rugby Club.\n\nIn 1921 it became the Memorial Ground, home of Bristol Rugby Club, and was opened on 24 September that year by G. B. Britton, the Lord Mayor of Bristol, as a home for Bristol Rugby Club.\n\nSituated on Filton Avenue in Horfield, Bristol, it has developed significantly over the years. A massive crowd turned out to watch the first (Bristol Rugby) game ever game to be held there against Cardiff, but did so from wooden terraces and stands. With the advent of leagues in the late 1980s, Bristol looked to develop the ground, replacing the old Shed on the north side with the Centenary Stand to mark the club's 100th anniversary in 1988. The West Stand, an original feature of the ground, was demolished in 1995 having been condemned, and replaced.\n\nIn 1996, Bristol Rovers moved in as tenants of Bristol Rugby Club, and then entered into joint ownership through the Memorial Stadium Company. After just two years, in 1998, the rugby club was relegated from the Premiership (causing them severe financial difficulties) and under the terms of the agreement Bristol Rovers were able to buy Bristol Rugby's share of the stadium for a 'nominal fee', a clause designed to protect either party should one or the other fall into financial difficulties. The rugby club became tenants in their original home.\n\nBy 2005, the Memorial Stadium was hosting Bristol Rugby Club back in the Guinness Premiership, with Bristol Rovers continuing to compete in the lower levels of the Football League. A roof was added to the Clubhouse Terrace (paid for by Bristol Rovers supporters' efforts) and temporary stands at the south and south-west of the ground have brought capacity up to 11,916. Bristol Rugby were again relegated out of the Premiership in 2009.\n\nIn February 2013, after months of speculation, Bristol Rugby announced that they would move and share a ground with Bristol City at the redeveloped Ashton Gate Stadium. The rugby club played their final game at the Mem on 4 June 2014, a Championship play-off final second leg against London Welsh. There was no fairytale ending for Bristol though as London Welsh won the game 21–20 to condemn the side to a sixth straight season outside the Premiership.\n\nThe ground has remained a focal point for the wider Bristol community, and a minute's silence is held annually at the closest game to Remembrance Sunday, while on 11 November a service of remembrance is held at the Memorial Gates with players and officials from both Bristol Rovers and Bristol Rugby attending the service each year. On Christmas Eve 2015, the memorial gates were vandalized by supporters of Bristol City. \n\nThe stadium is also used for the rugby varsity between the city's two universities, University of the West of England and University of Bristol. In 2013, the stadium hosted the Rugby League World Cup Group D match between the Cook Islands and the United States attracting a crowd of 7,247. Gloucester Rugby played two pre-season friendlies at the stadium whilst their home ground, Kingsholm Stadium, was being used for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\nIn 2018 there was a crowd recording for the 2018 Aardman film Early Man at the memorial Stadium. .\n\nThe Memorial Stadium Company proposed a wide ranging £35 million refurbishment of the Memorial Stadium, bringing it up to an 18,500 all-seater capacity. On 17 January 2007, Bristol City Council granted permission for the stadium redevelopment.\n\nThe new stadium would have included a 97-room hotel, 99 student flats, a restaurant, a convenience store, offices and a public gym.\n\nOn 17 August 2007, it was announced that the stadium's redevelopment had been delayed and would commence in May 2008 and finish in December 2009. During this time period of reconstruction, Bristol Rovers would have ground-shared with Cheltenham Town at Whaddon Road while Bristol Rugby would have played across the Severn Bridge, sharing Newport Gwent Dragons' Rodney Parade ground. The Section 106 legal agreement, which was the main cause for the delay in the redevelopment, was finally signed on 4 January 2008, but more delays were encountered when on 30 May 2008 Rovers admitted that their preferred student accommodation providers had pulled out of the project, leaving the club to find an alternative company. This caused the redevelopment to be put back another year, to 2009. More delays, mostly attributed to the ongoing financial crisis, meant that by mid-2011 the stadium redevelopment had yet to begin.\n\nIn June 2011, Bristol Rovers announced its intentions to relocate the club to the newly proposed UWE Stadium instead of redeveloping the Memorial Stadium. In order to fund the new stadium, the Mem is to be sold to supermarket chain Sainsbury's with Rovers paying a peppercorn rent with work to redevelop the site not beginning until Rovers complete their move to the new stadium. Planning permission was granted for the UWE Stadium site in July 2012 and the Sainsbury's plans for the Memorial Stadium in January 2013. Work was expected to begin on the UWE Stadium shortly after but multiple delays caused by legal challenges held the project up. In 2014, Sainsbury's pulled out of the project and were subsequently taken to court by Rovers. Sainsbury's won the court case and appeal that followed leaving the entire project again in doubt.\n\nIn August 2017 following the takeover of the club by the Al-Qadi family, and extensive negotiations with the UWE, the club announced that it was no longer looking to build a new stadium in collaboration with the UWE but would once again explore redeveloping the Memorial Stadium instead.\n\n"}

Knockout power is a similar concept relating to the probability of any strike to the head to cause unconsciousness. Knockout power is related to the force delivered and precision of the strike.\n\nIn order to increase the mass behind a punch, it is essential to move the body as a unit throughout the punch. Power is generated from the ground up, such that force from the ankles transfers to the knees; force from the knees transfers to the thighs; force from the thighs transfers to the core; from the core to the chest; from the chest to the shoulders; from the shoulders to the forearms and finally the compounded force transfers through the fist into an opponent. So the most powerful punchers are able to connect their whole body and channel the force from each portion of the body into a punch.\n\nGenerally, there are five components to punching power that must be present for a puncher to be considered truly powerful: lack of arm punching, proper weight shifting, stepping during a punch, pivoting with a punch, and using proper footwork.\n\nThis body connection requires the development of a strong core. The core is perhaps the most important element in a powerful punch, since it connects the powerhouse of the legs to the delivery system of the arms. Basic core conditioning exercises include abdominal crunches, situps and leg raises.\n\n"}

With Chile he took part in seven Copa América and one FIFA World Cup.\n\nSerjio (later Sergio) Livingstone's family hailed from Scotland. His father John, who played for Santiago National FC, was a pioneer of the game in Chile. Livingstone originally joined Unión Española. He abandoned football to study law at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Soon he acquainted himself with the university's football team, and from 1938 he began to establish himself as the goalkeeper of CD Universidad Católica.\n\nHe debuted in the national team at the 1941 South American Championship which took place in Chile, winning 5–0 against Ecuador. By the end of the tournament Chile ended third, and Livingstone was considered the best player of the tournament. Altogether, Livingstone played between 1941 and 1954 in 52 matches for Chile, which made him the country's record international until 1962, participating in five more South American Championships, totaling 34 matches in this competition, which remains record. He also took part in the FIFA World Cup 1950 in Brazil, where Chile exited after the first group phase. \n\nAt club level he spent 1943 in Argentina playing 30 matches for Racing Club. He cut short his time in Argentina for sentimental reasons and rejoined Católica in 1944, winning the national championships of 1949 and 1954. After the second title the club had the misfortune to be relegated in the season immediately thereafter, but managed to return to the first division as quickly. After a brief spell on loan in 1957 with Colo-Colo he once more returned to Universidad Católica where he finished his career in 1959.\nFollowing his football career, he became a well-known sports journalist and television personality with Televisión Nacional de Chile, where he remained until his death (more than 60 years).\n\nIn 2009, a street in the district of Independencia in Santiago was named for Livingstone.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1290523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1290523", "title": "Union Grounds", "text": "Union Grounds\n\nUnion Grounds was a baseball park located in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York. The grounds opened in 1862, its inaugural match being played on May 15. It was the first baseball park enclosed entirely by a fence, thereby allowing proprietor William Cammeyer or his tenant to charge admission. This permitted paying customers to watch the games from benches in a stand while non-paying spectators could only watch from embankments outside the grounds.\n\nThe ball grounds was built on a large block bounded by Harrison Avenue, Rutledge Street, Lynch Street, and Marcy Avenue. A writer for the Brooklyn Eagle described the field in 1862: \"The buildings occupied last winter are left standing, used pretty much for the same purposes as them.[sic] Near these a long wooden shed has been erected, capable of accommodating several hundred persons, and benches provided for the convenience of the fair sex... Several acres more have been added to the enclosure, which is fenced in with a board fence six or seven feet in height. On the southeast corner a large and commodious club house has been erected, containing accommodations for three clubs. The field is now almost a perfect level, covering at least some six acres of ground, all of which is well drained, rolled, and in a few weeks will be in splendid condition... Several flagstaffs have been put up, from which floated the banners of the clubs o'er shadowed by the nations' ensign.\"\n\nDuring its early years Union Grounds was the home field for several ballclubs, notably including the Eckford Club, 1862 and 1863 champions of the National Association of Base Ball Players. In 1868, the Mutual Club of New York moved in from Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey, long-time home of Manhattan clubs but never enclosed. The ballpark's entrance was on Rutledge Street, and a one-story building in right field, 350 feet away from home plate, was in play.\n\nAfter formation of the first professional league, the National Association of \"Professional\" Base Ball Players, Union Grounds was home to the Mutual Club from 1871 to 1876 (the only year as a member of the new National League), Eckford of Brooklyn of the National Association in 1872, and the Atlantic Club of Brooklyn of the National Association from 1873 to 1875. It also served as home field for the \"Hartford of Brooklyn\" team during the 1877 National League season. On July 26, 1878, the final major league game was played on the grounds, with Providence defeating Milwaukee 4-1. The grounds continued to host barnstorming major league clubs, amateur clubs and independent clubs through the 1882 season.\n\nThe park did not sit idle during the winter. Its field was flooded and served as the rink for an ice skating club. An unusual feature of the park was the presence of a pagoda in center field.\nUnion Grounds was demolished in July of 1883. Heyward Street now runs through the site, and as of 2009 the Juan Morel Campos Secondary School stands to the north of Heyward Street and the Marcy Avenue Armory stands to the south of it, with no historical marker or any other indication of the land's significance to the history of baseball.\n\n\n"}

She was designed by George Lennox Watson and built alongside \"HMY \"Britannia\"\" at the D&W Henderson shipyard, Meadowside, Partick on the River Clyde, Scotland in 1893 for owner Lord Dunraven of the Royal Yacht Squadron.\n\n\"Valkyrie II\" had a steel frame, a wooden hull, and a pine deck.\n\n\"Valkyrie II\" was launched on April 29, 1893, a week after \"Britannia\", and sailed to the U.S. that October to compete in the eighth America's Cup where she faced \"Vigilant\" in a best three out of five races format sailed on alternating courses. The races were sailed October 7, 9, and 13, 1893 off Sandy Hook, NJ just south of New York. The first and third races were 15 miles to windward off Scotland Lightship and return to leeward, the second race was a 30-mile equilateral triangle.\n\nIn the first race on October 7, \"Valkyrie II\" won the 11:25 am start by 15 seconds and one boat length.

The World reported it as the fastest race ever sailed, over a course of 15 miles to windward and return under reefed sail and a gale.\n\n\"Valkyrie II\" existed for barely a single year. On July 5, 1894 this Cup contender was struck amidships by A. D. Clarke’s cutter yacht \"Satanita\" at the start of the Mud Hook Regatta on the Firth of Clyde. Lord Dunraven and all his crew and guests were rescued, though one crewman was severely injured and subsequently died. \"Valkyrie II\" broke up and sank nine minutes later.\n\n\n"}
