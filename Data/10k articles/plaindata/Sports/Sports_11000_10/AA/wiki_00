The title is frequently honorary, but in some cases the captain may have significant responsibility for strategy and teamwork while the game is in progress on the field. In either case, it is a position that indicates honor and respect from one's teammates – recognition as a leader by one's peers. In association football and cricket, a captain is also known as a skipper.\n\nDepending on the sport, team captains may be given the responsibility of interacting with game officials regarding application and interpretation of the rules. In many team sports, the captains represent their respective teams when the match official does the coin toss at the beginning of the game. \n\nVarious sports have differing roles and responsibilities for team captains. \n\nSome of the greatest captains in history are the ones with the most subtle of traits that are required for success. From Sam Walker in his book \"The Captain Class\" he states that a captain is \"the most important factor for a team's success\". \n\nThe responsibilities of a captain vary from sport to sport, but overall help determine the game. In sports like cricket or volleyball, the decision for the two teams to be on either defense or offense is determined with a coin toss and a decision made by the captains. This decision is crucial for the captain because they will decide the beginning of the game and quite possibly how it all plays out.\n\nA captain is also the first one a referee looks to while explaining the results of a play or giving a foul, or flag. Often times a referee will not discuss these matters with any other player than a captain or a coach. This is important because the reaction of the captain may or may not determine how the referee will proceed. A captain must stay calm and cool headed when talking with a referee to ensure the most accurate determinants of the game.\n\n"}

Built on the old Bathgate estate, and operated by the American Jockey Club, its owner/members were led by financier Leonard W. Jerome and August Belmont, Sr. A luxurious clubhouse was built near a rise that looked over the race course on what was known as \"The Bluff\".\n\nIn those days, many would come to the racing park by horse, coach and carriage, or by railroad at Fordham Station, located at the bottom of Fordham Hill and Rose Hill in Old Fordham Village. Later in the century, it would connect to Bedford Park Station.\n\nThe first Belmont Stakes, the oldest of the three U.S. Triple Crown races which was named in honor of August Belmont, Sr., was held at Jerome Park Racetrack and continued to be run there until 1890 when it was moved to nearby Morris Park Racecourse.

On May 13 of that year, the track was the site of the first outdoor polo match ever held in the United States.\n\nIt is alleged that Lord Randolph Churchill first met Jerome's daughter, Jennie Jerome, later to be courted and married, at the race park, but this allegation is false. As attested by Sir Winston Churchill in his biography of his father, Lord Randolph Churchill was never in America before his marriage, and the couple actually met in August 1873 at a ball on board the Imperial Russian cruiser \"Ariadne\" while it was moored at Cowes on the Isle of Wight. The track closed on October 4, 1894 to make way for the Jerome Park Reservoir that was needed for the metropolitan New York City water supply system.\n\nThe land that formed the western half of the Jerome Park Racetrack was turned into the Jerome Park Reservoir. The eastern half of the land was later used for:\n\n\n\nDuring the 1920s, the eastern half of the land was considered as a possible site for the Museum of the Peaceful Arts.\n\n\n"}

It is the home of Mitcham Cricket Club and is reportedly the oldest cricket ground still in use, having been used for cricket since 1685.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Australian cricket team would stay at \"The Cricketers\" pub which overlooks the green and practise on the green whilst on tour. The pub also held the changing rooms for the club during the late 18th century, with the scorer having a position on the balcony of the inn. The present pavilion was built in 1904 and is rare in being one of only a few cricket pavilions to be separated from the ground by a road, (the A239).\n\nSurrey County Cricket Club first used the ground in 1949 for a match in the Minor Counties Championship. Surrey continued to use the ground for 2nd XI matches until 1973. Its first usage in the Second XI Championship was for a match in 1959. Surrey has never used Mitcham for a first-class match.\n\nThe most notable match of recent times was the Golden Jubilee Challenge Match, a match held between Mitcham and Hambledon Club, two of the oldest clubs in the country, in honour of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Ian Botham made a guest appearance with the Queen's Jubilee Baton. The match was a two innings affair.\n\nThe Cricket Green also lends its name to the nearby area, and is a Conservation area and council ward.\n\n\n"}

The first recorded match on the ground was in 1888, when Mitchells played Warwickshire Club and Ground. The first first-class match came in 1931 when Warwickshire played Kent. From 1931 to 1939, the ground hosted 9 first-class matches. First-class cricket returned to the ground in 1957, with Warwickshire play 4 further first-class matches at the ground. The following season the last of which was between Warwickshire and Cambridge University.\n\nAdditionally, the ground has played host to a number of matches involving the Warwickshire Second XI between 1949 and 1992. The ground has also hosted a number of ICC Trophy matches, the first of which came in the 1979 ICC Trophy between Denmark and Sri Lanka.

The width of the competition lanes is 4 metres. At the opposite straight of the finishing line, there is a crossing area, where the skaters must change lane.\n[ISU Special Regulations and Technical Rules] - Rule 203\n\nAt international competitions, the track must be 400 metres long, with a warm-up lane at least 4 metres wide inside the competition lanes. For Olympic competitions, the track must also be enclosed within a building.\n\nThe design and dimensions of a speed skating track have remained more or less unchanged since the foundation of ISU in 1892.\n\nThe speed skating track is also used for the sports of Icetrack cycling and Ice speedway\n\nThe measurement of the track is made half a meter into the lane. The total length of the track is the distance a competitor skates each lap, i.e. the length of two straights, one inner curve and one outer curve, in addition to the extra distance skated when changing lanes in the cross-over area, which on a standard track equals 7 centimeters.\n\n\nThe demarcation of the competition lanes are made by painted lines in the ice (ot a set of painted marks) and movable blocks of rubber. On outdoor tracks, snow may also be used for demarcation of the competition lanes.\n\nAlthough ISU regulations state that minimum measures for a standard speed skating track, alternative track lengths may be used for competition. The minimum requirements are track length on 200 meters, radius of inner curve of 15  meters and width of the competition lanes 2 meters.\n\nShort track speed skating tracks have a length of 111.111 metres (364.54 ft). The rink is 60 metres (200 ft) long by 30 metres (98 ft) wide, which is the same size as an international-sized ice hockey rink.\n\nMany speed skating venues have ice hockey rinks or no ice area at all inside the oval. A few are suitable also for bandy, like Hamar Olympic Hall, Ice Palace Krylatskoye, and Medeu. The National Speed Skating Oval in Beijing, China, which is in the process of being built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, is also designed appropriately for that sport. There is a growing cooperation between International Skating Union and Federation of International Bandy, since both have an interest in more indoor venues with large ice surfaces being built. In Norway there is an agreement in place, stating that an indoor arena intended primarily for either bandy or long track speed skating, shall have ice surface for the other sport as well.\n\nBelow is a complete list of the indoor 400 m speed skating tracks around the world. The data presented are retrieved from the online database Speed Skating News.\n\nIn the table below, some of the world's major outdoor speed skating tracks still in use are listed.

A long time ago it branched off into Korea. It no longer exists in China as its lineage has died off. However it still exists in Korea practiced by a dwindling few. \n\nWithin Korea each region had their own style of Subak. Subak styles from region to region differred slightly.\n\nOnly two Subak styles remain today. One is taught as purely as Subak. And the other Subak style has been absorbed into modern Taeekyon by Master Shin Han Song.\n\nWhen Master Shin Han Song tried to reserect Taekkyon after the Korean war, he sought instruction from the Taekkyon master Song Doki, & instruction from the Subak master Il Dong. Shin Han Song then combined Taekkyon & Subak together.\n\nSubak is of ancient origins and is different to Soo Bahk Do, which is a modern martial art using the same name (same pronunciation yet different spelling).\n\nHistorically, Subak may refer to the old Korean martial art of \"taekkyeon,\" but historians are still uncertain since little is known about it. It is acknowledged, however, that Subak flourished during the Yi dynasty. During the Yi dynasty, a book was published to teach the game as a martial art. Since then, Subak has contributed to the evolution of Korean martial arts, which also included the \"yusul\".\n\nBy the 18th century, the king practiced Subak, as the text Dongsa-gangmok (동사강목) from this time suggests:\nAt this point, Subak was not only considered martial art but was also practiced as an organized sport that was staged as a form of spectator entertainment.\n\nThe word \"Seonbae\" (also romanized as \"sonbae\", literally: \"elders\" - 先輩/선배) is sometimes translated to mean \"a man of virtue who never retreats from a fight\", and was used to signify a member of Koguryo's warrior corps. Members of the \"Seonbae\" lived in groups and learned archery, Gakju (ancestor of ssireum) and Subak (ancestor of taekkyon), history, literature, and other liberal arts. Although they were constantly training in combat, during peace time they committed to relief periods, such as by helping construct roads and fortresses and assist after natural disasters.\n\n\"Subak\" took a heavy blow during the Joseon period, which was founded on the ideology of Confucianism, stressing literary art over martial art. \"Subak\" was only allowed to be practiced in competitions called \"subakhui\" (수박희). After three consecutively successful \"subakhui\" bouts, only then could the winner become employed as a soldier.\n\nDuring the beginning of the Joseon dynasty, \"Subak\" became Taekkyeon. Yusul (meaning \"soft art\") and Taekkyeon both share \"yusul\" movements. \n\nSubak is suspected to be the same art as Taekkyeon with a different name. \"Yusul\" [유술/柔術] is written with the same Hanja as Jujutsu and since 柔 means \"soft/pliable/yielding\" any yusul techniques would naturally \"redirect\" an opponent's force rather than meet it head on. \"Kwonsul\" [권술/拳術], is the contrasting term and although it literally means \"fist technique\" it no doubt included strikes made with the feet as well as the hands. \"Taekkyeon\" 택견 was a term regarded more in line with a game or idle training methodology, whereas \"kwonsul\" [권술/拳術] or \"kwonbeop\" [권법/拳法] was the terminology usually associated with hand-to-hand fighting techniques. A similar argument could be made regarding \"ssireum\" [씨름] (a game) and \"japgi\" [잡기] (grappling skills).\n"}

It can be described as the, \"back half of a bicycle.\" The rider of a trailer bike usually has a saddle, handlebars, and pedals. Some fold for more compact storage.\n\nThe trailer bike was patented by Canadian entrepreneur Delbert Adams. Adams started the manufacturer of trailer bikes, Trail-a-Bike, and began selling them in the early 1990s, although the same concept had been previously independently and imitatively invented by others at least as far back as the 1930s with the Rann Trailer.\n\nTrailer bikes have come in a variety of configurations. These include upright-bicycle-like seating, and recumbent-bicycle-like seating as with the Weehoo iGo. Trailer bikes have been available in single-seat and tandem configurations. Trailer bikes may have just one gear or more than one. They seldom have brakes.\n\nA trailer bike is attached to a bicycle at either the seatpost or on a special rear rack by a linkage that allows for pivoting.

The following year (1993), the PGA of America purchased a 25% interest in the club. After the championship in 1996, the PGA of America raised its stake to 50% and announced that the event would return to Valhalla in 2000. At its conclusion, the PGA of America exercised an option to purchase the remaining interest in the club. Later that year, it announced that the Ryder Cup would be held at Valhalla in 2008.\n\nValhalla also hosted the PGA Club Professional Championship in 2002 and the Senior PGA Championship in 2004. The PGA Championship was originally scheduled to be played at Valhalla in 2004, but the PGA of America switched it to Whistling Straits in Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2009, the PGA of America announced that the Senior PGA Championship and the PGA Championship would return to Valhalla in 2011 and 2014, respectively.\n\nThe course sits on a property on Shelbyville Road (US 60) in the eastern portion of Louisville just outside the Gene Snyder Freeway (I-265) It was envisioned by local business leader Dwight Gahm (pronounced \"game\") and his three sons in 1981, and opened five years later.

Four years later, the 2000 PGA Championship also went to a playoff; Tiger Woods won by one stroke over Bob May in the revised three-hole format. Woods had a 3-4-5=12 to May's 4-4-5=13 on the course's final three holes. It was Woods' second consecutive PGA Championship, his fifth major title and his third consecutive major title (beginning with the 2000 US Open - a streak that continued into the \"Tiger Slam\" at the 2001 Masters.) Valhalla hosted its third PGA Championship in 2014, when Rory McIlroy beat Phil Mickelson also by one stroke. Beforehand, the course had undergone a major \"modernization\" after it hosted the Senior PGA Championship in 2011, which included the rebuilding of all 18 greens.\n\nIn addition, Valhalla hosted the Ryder Cup in 2008, with the United States defeating Europe 16½ to 11½ for the first U.S. win since their comeback victory in 1999 at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts.

Its name commemorates a legendary Polish 15th-century knight, Zawisza Czarny (Zawisza the Black). The club holds many sections: football, track and field athletics, boxing, rowing, canoeing, weightlifting, gymnastics, shooting, and parachuting ones.\n\nThe team was founded in 1946, as a military-sponsored club in Koszalin, although they only played friendly matches initially. When the army headquarters moved to Bydgoszcz a year later in 1947 the club followed.\n\nThe football team has achieved some successes, playing for several years in the Polish First Division, first winning promotion in 1961.\n\nThey reached the semi-finals of the Polish Cup in 1991 and competed in 1993 Intertoto Cup.\n\nZawisza was relegated from the Second Level to Fourth Level in the 1997–98 season. In 2001, they controversially merged with Chemik Bydgoszcz, and played as Chemik-Zawisza, whilst the reserve team was initially meant to be called Zawisza-Chemik, although ultimately the reserved team remained as simply \"Zawisza\". The merger turned out to be very unsuccessful, and the senior side started anew from the bottom of the league pyramid reverting to \"Chemik\", leaving the reserve team in the fifth division, which subsequently became Zawisza's senior team.\n\nAside from the ongoing Hydrobudowa scandal between 2006 and 2008, the original team were promoted to the Third Level after finishing 1st in their regional Group of the 3rd liga in the 2007–2008 season. On 12 June 2011, after a 13-year absence, Zawisza was promoted to the Second Division after finishing second 5 points behind Olimpia Grudziądz in the Third Division West in the 2010–11 season. In 2013 Zawisza won the Polish Second Division and were promoted.\n\nThey won the Polish Cup in the 2013–14 season, 6–5 on penalties after a goalless 120 minutes against Zagłębie Lubin, and qualified to UEFA Europe League second qualifying round.\n\nAfter the club had finished 5th in 2015–16 I liga, it did not receive a license for the following season due to financial problems and dissolved. The refounded club SP Zawisza started the 2016-17 season in Klasa B, grupa Bydgoszcz III which is in the 8th tier of Polish football.\n\nZawisza's under-19 team won the national youth championship in 1981.\n\nZawisza Bydgoszcz SA was a club that was created when Kujawiak Włocławek were moved to Bydgoszcz and renamed by Hydrobudowa, their owners. The original Zawisza Bydgoszcz continued playing in the fourth division. however the new club had a very similar logo and an identical name. As a result, Kujawiak, Zawisza and supporters all over the country boycotted the relocated team. The reserve team continued to play under the name Kujawiak Włocławek in the Fourth Polish league. Many considered this club to be a continuation of Zawisza.\n\nThe club lasted two seasons in the Second Division, before it folded in 2007 as a result of serious corruption allegations and widespread condemnation.\n\nZawisza's crest has changed several times. \n\nThe fan movement at Zawisza started in the 1970s, one of the first clubs with organised support in the country. Since then club has always attracted a large support considering its relative lack of success. The club enjoys support from around Cuiavia, with fan-clubs in several other major towns, most notably in Inowrocław, Janikowo, Nakło and Mogilno, among several others.\n\nThe fans have good relations with fans of ŁKS Łódź, GKS Tychy, Zagłębie Lubin and Górnik Wałbrzych. Their arch-rivals are fellow locals Polonia Bydgoszcz, with whom they contest the Bydgoszcz Derby, and regional rivals Elana Toruń, with whom they play the Cuiavian Derby, with the Toruń and Bydgoszcz rivalry between the two cities one which goes even beyond sport.\n\nIn the 21st Century, the Zawisza fans have encountered numerous challenges from owners, city council, politicians and the media, frequently battling against them for public support.\n\nFirst they opposed the controversial merger with Chemik Bydgoszcz in 2001, choosing to boycott the new merged club (which turned out to be hugely unsuccessful) and support the reserve team which still played under the Zawisza name.\n\nIn 2006, the fans opposed the new relocated Zawisza, again opting to continue to support the original team made up of the reserve squad. When the \"new Zawisza\" failed to win any trophies and was embroiled in a match-fixing scandal, subsequently folding, the fans triumphantly announced victory against the media and politicians who supported it.\n\nIn 2008, the fans protested against the city council which was insistent on renaming the newly rebuilt stadium as the \"Municipal Stadium\", with the fans claiming that to omit any link to Zawisza was unfair.\n\nIn 2014, the fans began to boycott matches after a match against Widzew Łódź. The fans claim that the police assaulted fans, when preventing Zawisza and ŁKS Łódź fans from entering the stadium. Following the incident, the fans asked to see the security footage, however, the footage was claimed to be lost due to an alleged \"technical fault\". The club chairman, Radosław Osuch, and a large portion of the media and public opinion, attributed the incident to football hooliganism. The players supported the chairman, sparking fury from the fans. Osuch threatened to relocate the club, and has openly declared war against the fans He changed the club crest to the similar crest used by the relocated Zawisza in 2006, further angering the fans. Since 2014, the boycott has been upheld, meaning that there has been low attendances and support during matches, including the historic Polish Cup win. In January 2015, a group of fans broke into the stadium and placed 15 coffins on the pitch, depicting 14 players and the chairman, and a banner with the words \"Osuch's whore spares, you are morally dead\", as a protest against the chairman and the players. The club issued a criminal investigation into the incident. In May 2015, after Górnik Łęczna keeper Sergiusz Prusak displayed a T-shirt showing his support to the Zawisza fans, the Zawisza fans decided to break their boycott for one match only to come and thank him in a match against Górnik. In order to prevent the fans from coming to Zawisza, Osuch subsequently raised the match ticket price to a very high 200zł in order to stop the fans attending. After 5 years, Osuch decided to leave the club, however upon this announcement the players and staff also all resigned. Without investment, the club was disbanded by Osuch as last act, stating that there is a poor atmosphere surrounding Polish football. The fans reformed the club and had to start the new season from the lowest level on the football pyramid.\n\n\"As of 30 June 2015\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
