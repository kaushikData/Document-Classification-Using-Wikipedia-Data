It began with wholesale changes, as second year General Manager Craig Button continued to change the look of the team. In two separate draft-day trades, the Flames dealt goaltender Fred Braithwaite and forwards Valeri Bure and Jason Wiemer away, gaining back Roman Turek and Rob Niedermayer.\n\nThe changes appeared to pay off, as the Flames stormed out to a 13–2–2–2 record, and first place in the division. The result prompted the Flames to sign Turek - a pending unrestricted free agent - to a long-term deal. The team, however, collapsed, winning only 19 of their remaining 63 games, finishing 4th in the Northwest Division, and out of the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season.\n\nThe season ended with head coach Greg Gilbert and top forward Marc Savard in a bitter, public feud that included the latter demanding a trade late in the season and into the summer.\n\nIndividually, Jarome Iginla broke into the spotlight, leading the NHL in goals (52) and points (96). His season would land him the Rocket Richard Trophy, the Art Ross Trophy and the Lester B. Pearson Award. Iginla also finished second in Hart Memorial Trophy voting, tied with winner Jose Theodore on points (434), but behind Theodore in first place votes (26–23).\n\nIginla was also a member of Canada's team at the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics. He recorded two goals in the gold medal game against the United States, which Canada won 5–2 to claim their first ice hockey gold medal in 50 years.\n\nThe Flames were involved in a tragic incident during their March 16, 2002, game in Columbus against the Blue Jackets. During the second period of the contest, a slapshot by Columbus' Espen Knutsen was deflected into the crowd off the stick of Flames defenceman Derek Morris. The puck struck a fan, 13-year-old Brittanie Cecil, who was at her first NHL game. Though she was able to leave the game under her own power, the blow tore a vertebral artery and resulted in a blood clot. She died two days later; she was the first fan to die at a game in the NHL's 85-year history. Three months after the incident, the NHL instituted a policy requiring that protective netting be placed around the ends of each rink prior to the start of the 2002–03 season, a decision which both the Flames and Blue Jackets advocated.\n\nThe Flames finished 11th in the Western Conference, 15 points back of the 8th place Vancouver Canucks. This was the sixth consecutive season the Flames failed to qualify for the post-season.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\n\nDenotes player spent time with another team before joining Calgary.

The Flames had the 11th overall pick, however traded it to the Phoenix Coyotes in a swap that saw them gain the 14th pick.\n\nThe baby Flames followed up their Calder Cup winning season with a disappointing 29–34–13–4 result in 2001–02, finishing in last place in the Canadian Division, missing the playoffs. Blair Betts led the Flames with just 49 points, while Dany Sabourin was the top goaltender in limited action.\n\nThe Chiefs finished the 2001–02 ECHL season with a 39–31–2 record, good enough for third place in the Northwest Division. They were knocked out of the playoffs in the second round by the Dayton Bombers.\n\n\n"}

It is usually fitted with a shoulder strap or means for fastening it to a belt, and may be covered with a cloth bag and padding to protect the bottle and insulate the contents. If the padding is soaked with water, evaporative cooling can help keep the contents of the bottle cool. Many canteens also include a nested canteen cup.\n\nPrimitive canteens were sometimes made of hollowed-out gourds, such as a calabash, or were bags made of leather.\n\nLater, canteens consisted of a glass bottle in a woven basket cover. The bottle was usually closed with a cork stopper.\n\nDesigns of the mid-1900s were made of metal — tin-plated steel, stainless steel or aluminum — with a screw cap, the cap frequently being secured to the bottle neck with a short chain or strap to prevent loss. These were an improvement over glass bottles, but were subject to developing pinhole leaks if dented, dropped or bumped against jagged rocks.\n\nContemporary designs are almost exclusively made of one of several types of plastics, especially polyethylene or polycarbonate. They are typically as light as, or lighter than, their metal equivalents and are quite resistant to developing leaks, even when dropped or severely bumped.\n\nHunter-gatherers in the Kalahari use ostrich eggshell as water containers in which they puncture a hole to enable them to be used as canteens. The presence of such eggshells dating from the Howiesons Poort period of the Middle Stone Age at Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa suggests canteens were used by humans as early as 60,000 years ago.\n"}

{"id": "240158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240158", "title": "Corked bat", "text": "Corked bat\n\nIn baseball, a corked bat is a specially modified baseball bat that has been filled with cork or other lighter, less dense substances to make the bat lighter. A lighter bat gives a hitter a quicker swing and may improve the hitter's timing. In Major League Baseball, modifying a bat with foreign substances and using it in play is illegal and subject to ejection and further punishment.\n\nTo cork a bat, a hole approximately 1/2-inch (12.5 mm) in diameter is drilled down through the thick end of the bat roughly six inches deep. Crushed cork, bouncy ball, sawdust, or other similar material is compacted into the hole and the end is typically patched up with glue and sawdust. However, this weakens the bat's structural integrity and makes it more susceptible to breakage, even more so if the cork is placed beyond roughly six inches into the bat. Corked bats are typically discovered when they break during play.\n\nCorked bats were tested in the 2007 season of MythBusters where it was found that the cork was detrimental to the bat's performance.\n\nUsing a corked bat in Major League Baseball is in violation of Rule 6.06 (d), which reads in full:\n\nA batter is out for illegal action when:\n\n(d) He uses or attempts to use a bat that, in the umpire's judgment, has been altered or tampered with in such a way to improve the distance factor or cause an unusual reaction on the baseball. This includes, bats that are filled, flat surfaced, nailed, hollowed, grooved or covered with a substance such as paraffin, wax, etc. No advancement on the bases will be allowed and any out or outs made during a play shall stand. In addition to being called out, the player shall be ejected from the game and may be subject to additional penalties as determined by his League Punishment advisor.\nWhile filling a bat with cork makes it lighter, there is no rule that prevents a player from using a lighter, uncorked bat. However, lighter wood bats are shorter than heavier bats.\n\nSince , six players have been caught using corked bats. The following table summarizes these events:\n\nIn addition, former player and Major League manager Phil Garner admitted in January 2010 on a Houston radio station that he used a corked bat against Gaylord Perry and \"hit a home run\" with it.\n\nIn 2010, \"Deadspin\" reported that Pete Rose used corked bats during his 1985 pursuit of Ty Cobb's all-time hits record. Two sports memorabilia collectors who owned Rose's game-used bats from that season had the bats x-rayed and found the telltale signs of corking. Rose had previously denied using corked bats.\n\n"}

It is named for Charles Doak, who was the head coach of the NC State baseball team from 1924–1939. The stadium is located on NC State's West Campus, behind Lee and Sullivan residence halls. The diamond is in the north/northwest corner of its block, which is bounded by Thurman Drive (third base, north/northeast); Dail Park and the residence halls (left field, east/southeast); Sullivan Drive (right field, south/southwest); and Varsity Drive (first base, west/northwest). Its seating capacity is 2,500 spectators, with an overflow capacity of 3,000. The largest crowd at Doak Field since its 2004 renovation was 3,109 on April 28, 2007, in a series finale between NC State and its rival UNC. Doak Field hosted the Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournament in both 1974 and in 1980. NC State won the championship in 1974, while Clemson won in 1980.\n\nPrior to 1966, the Wolfpack played their home games at Riddick Stadium, which was primarily a football facility.\n\nIn May 2004, the stadium underwent a $6 million renovation which included leveling the playing field, a new drainage system, new grandstands, a new press box, and new concessions and bathroom facilities.\n\nSince the renovation was completed in 2004, the dimensions at Doak Field are asymmetrical at 320 feet down the left-field line, 370 feet to the left-field power alley, 400 feet to straightaway center field, 375 feet to the right-field power alley, and 330 down the right-field line. The wall from the left-field line to deep left-center field is 16 feet high, then drops to eight feet high all the rest of the way around to right field.\n\nIn 2013, the Wolfpack ranked 33rd among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 1,994 per home game. In 2014, the Wolfpack ranked 45th in attendance, averaging 1,344 per home game.\n\nThe student section of the grandstands along the third base line is known as Avent's Army.

It is believed that some type of game similar to this already existed prior to European contact. While it is adherent that Volleyball was invented in 1895, and the first world tournaments were held 1949, organized tournaments of Ecuavolley were held in 1958, suggesting it could not have spread throughout the world that quickly, which would mean that the national volley game was developed independently and had a convergent evolution. Ecuavoley tournaments in neighborhoods were held by different organization since 1944.\n\nThe setup of the game is similar to volleyball, with a few key differences:\n\nThe flyer plays behind the setter and server, and runs quickly from one side to another recovering balls. Usually the flyer recovers the ball for the server. The server sets the ball in the air so that the setter can pass the ball over the net. The setter places the ball on the opposite court in a strategic manner, in an attempt to deceive the other team of where it will land. The referee is called the judge.\n\n"}

{"id": "32039550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32039550", "title": "North Arm Speedway", "text": "North Arm Speedway\n\nNorth Arm Speedway was the first dedicated motorcycle speedway ever built in Adelaide, South Australia and was located in the industrial suburb of Gillman. It was run by the Speedway Riders' Association of South Australia and ran from 1981 until its forced closure in 1997.\n\nNorth Arm Speedway was South Australia's first dedicated senior Solo and Sidecar track. Previous tracks (other than the Wayville Showgrounds in the late 1920s and early 1930s which ran before car speedway became popular) in both Adelaide and around the state had generally catered to both bikes and cars.\n\nThe speedway was opened on Sunday 26 July 1981, by the Speedway Riders' Association on land owned by the South Australian Government. Following the closure of Rowley Park Speedway in April 1979, the only Dirt track racing venue in Adelaide was the new Speedway Park, which has a clay surface, something that suited the increasingly popular car racing, but not motorcycle speedway. Despite the bikes racing in the early years at Speedway Park, the nearest speedway to Adelaide which suited bike racing was some 80 km away at the Riverview Speedway in Murray Bridge, which during the speedway season (generally October to April) only ran meetings every second Saturday night. With many of South Australia's riders based in Adelaide, the decision was made to build a motorcycle only venue in Adelaide with a Dolomite surface where weekly meetings could be run.\n\nThe track itself was approximately in length, which while considered small by Australian track standards (when it was built, most Aussie speedways were usually 350-550m in length as most run cars as well as bikes with Speedway Park itself being long), it was roughly the same length as most tracks in Britain where most of the top riders rode professionally. The safety fence was a 2m high chain mesh fence on top of a 1 ft high wooden retaining fence. Lights were eventually installed for night meetings in 1985, although spectator capacity was only around 5,000 (more with extra seating for Australian Championship meetings).\n\nDue to North Arm's relatively small spectator capacity, and its lack of lights for night racing, both the Australian Sidecar Championship and the Australian Solo Championship were awarded to Speedway Park with its capacity to comfortably hold over 10,000 spectators in both 1982 and 1983 respectively.\n\nWhen it first opened North Arm Speedway held regular Sunday afternoon meetings so as not to compete with Speedway Park which ran Friday nights and had the bikes on the program, and also to avoid clashing with meetings at the Riverview Speedway. South Australian riders would regularly race three days per week at home, something most experienced when racing in the British Leagues during the Australian winter months.\n\nAfter the 1984/85 season, bikes were off the program at Speedway Park following safety concerns after the death of rider Kevin O'Connell on 25 January 1985. O'Connell had been killed after he hit the speedway's concrete retaining wall which offered no protection to riders or passengers. With the bikes no longer competing at Speedway Park, lights were installed at North Arm in 1985 and the speedway began holding regular Friday night meetings from 1985/86 which lasted until the speedway's closure. During the winter of 1986 the pits at North Arm were also re-located. Originally they were outside the back straight but were moved to outside of the front straight behind the control tower (which also incorporated the announcers box). The old pits became car parking while Turn 3 for the solo's (Turn 2 for the sidecars) became known as the Old Pits Corner.\n\nFrom 1983 until it closed in 1997 North Arm became the regular host of the South Australian Solo and Sidecar championships, hosting the Solo title 10 times. The only other tracks to host the SA Solo title during this period were the Westline Speedway in Whyalla (1986/87) and Riverview Speedway (1984/85, 1987/88, 1990/91).\n\nNorth Arm hosted the 1992 Australian Solo Championship, where a capacity crowd of over 6,000 fans saw Leigh Adams from Victoria win the first of a record 10 national championships (a temporary grandstand was erected on the outside of turn 1 for the expected attendance). Adams set a track record in the 2nd heat of the night with a time of 58.74 seconds for the 4 lap race. The record he broke had been set in Heat 1 of the championship by reigning South Aussie Champ Craig Hodgson who won in a time of 59.11 seconds. Leigh Adams won with 14 points from North Arm's own Shane Parker on 13 and Queensland's Mark Carlson third on 11 points. This meeting also saw the crash which almost ended the career of Australia's former World #3 from 1990, Todd Wiltshire who suffered a multiple back injuries and broken pelvis which force him to retire at age 23 though he did make a successful comeback in 1997. Wiltshire, battling with Jason Lyons for the lead going into the last turn of Heat 3, tried a pass on the outside and went down, sliding into the wooden safety fence which broke around a light pole (placed outside the fence) on impact in the old pit corner.\n\nUnfortunately during its 16-year life span, North Arm was never awarded the right to host the Australian Sidecar Championship, although it did host some of Australia's richest Sidecar meetings.\n\nNorth Arm Speedway's spectator capacity was pushed to the limit on a number of occasions including test Matches between Australia with riders such as Phil Crump, Todd Wiltshire, Leigh Adams and local riders Shane Parker, Scott Norman and Shane Bowes taking on visiting 'teams' such as a \"Rest of the World\" team in 1990 including Gary Havelock of England, Mitch Shirra of New Zealand, and Shawn Moran of the United States (while the injured Sam Ermolenko was guest commentator on the night). In 1991 Australia faced a powerful Swedish team led by 1990 World Champion Per Jonsson, former dual Ice Racing World Champion Erik Stenlund, as well as 1990 World finalists Jimmy Nilsen and Henrik Gustafsson and 1988 World Under-21 Champion Peter Nahlin (who was the Swedish reserve on the night). The Swede's also had in their riding lineup a young rider who was not only the reigning Swedish Champion, but the rider would go on equal Ivan Mauger's six Speedway World Championships, the great Tony Rickardsson. Both the 1990 and 1991 test matches attracted 4,000 and 4,800 fans respectively, well up on previous crowd figures for the speedway. It was the success of those two international meetings which led to the speedway being awarded the 1992 Australian Solo Championship.\n\nThe 1990/91 season also saw the first, and so far only tour of Australia by the official USSR team, who while not facing Australia in a test, faced state teams and various other 'select' teams while on tour. They faced a South Australian Select team in their visit to North Arm on 28 December 1990 with the locals, strengthened by 'ring-ins' Dennis Löfqvist from Sweden and David Norris from England (resident North Arm international riders) defeating the Russians 53-37 in a match closer than the score suggests. Actual local riders Shane Bowes (team captain) and Shane Parker top scored for the 'SA' with 13 and 8 points respectively while Oleg Kurguskin with 11 and the late Rif Saitgareev with 10 points top scored for the Russians.\n\nDuring its lifetime North Arm was also the Australian base for various international riders racing in the Australian Speedway season with riders such as Shawn Moran (USA), Vesa Ylinen of Finland, Dennis Löfqvist from Sweden and David Norris from England all basing themselves in Adelaide. North Arm was also the Australian base for two future Speedway World Champions. Twenty-year-old Gary Havelock from England (the 1992 World Champion) spent the 1987/88 Australian season based at North Arm, while 2010 World Champion Tomasz Gollob from Poland (along with his brother Jacek who made a number of appearances), made North Arm his Aussie home during 1994/95.\n\nWhile North Arm had its fair share of accidents, sometimes resulting in serious injury, no competitor was ever killed at the speedway or later as the result of a crash.\n\nFollowing the 1996/97 Australian Speedway season (generally run between October and April), North Arm Speedway was closed when the South Australian Government reclaimed the land that the speedway was located on. This left Adelaide without an operating motorcycle speedway for the first time since 1926 when racing was first held at the Wayville Showground. Most of North Arm's track surface was then moved less than 2 km away to the new Gillman Speedway to form the base of a track that was used for daytime practice meetings until a larger track was built for race meetings before the current track was opened in 2000.\n\nEven though Friday night meetings at the track were held in summer, North Arm could actually be cold when the wind was blowing from the north or west (the track was located close to the marshlands and adjacent to the Port River and the Gulf St Vincent). The speedway also had spectator facilities which could be described average at best. Despite this, North Arm Speedway is fondly remembered by those who either rode there or were regular spectators.\n\nToday the site of North Arm Speedway shows nothing of its past as a speedway as industrial buildings now occupy the land. The last remnants of the speedway were removed in mid-2004 when what was left of the track itself was cleared and building starting in mid-2005. When looking on Google Earth at historic photos the start/finish line of the speedway was on the Grand Trunkway (road) side of the track, with the pit area located between the front straight and the road. Car parking for the speedway was in the area to the north of the track.\n\n\n\nSome of the competitors who raced at North Arm Speedway between 1981 and 1997 were:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1393353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1393353", "title": "Super Ball", "text": "Super Ball\n\nA Super Ball (a.k.a. SuperBall) is a toy bouncing ball based on a type of synthetic rubber invented in 1964 by chemist Norman Stingley. It is an extremely elastic ball made of Zectron which contains the synthetic polymer polybutadiene as well as hydrated silica, zinc oxide, stearic acid, and other ingredients. This compound is vulcanized with sulfur at a temperature of and formed at a pressure of . The resulting Super Ball has a very high coefficient of restitution, and dropped from shoulder level, a Super Ball bounces nearly all the way back; thrown down by an average adult, it can leap over a three-story building.\n\nToys similar to Super Balls are more generally known as bouncy balls, a term that covers other balls by different manufacturers with different formulations.\n\nStingley sought uses for his Polybutadiene synthetic rubber, as well as someone to manufacture it. He first offered his invention to the Bettis Rubber Company, for whom he worked at the time, but they turned it down because the material was not very durable. So Stingley took it to toy company Wham-O; they worked on developing a more durable version which they still manufacture today.\n\n\"It took us nearly two years to iron the kinks out of Super Ball before we produced it,\" said Richard Knerr, President of Wham-O in 1966. \"It always had that marvelous springiness…. But it had a tendency to fly apart. We've licked that with a very high-pressure technique for forming it. Now we're selling millions.\" \n\nSuper Ball became a fad when it was introduced. Peak production reached over 170,000 Super Balls per day. By December 1965, over six million had been sold, and U.S. Presidential adviser McGeorge Bundy had five dozen shipped to the White House for the amusement of the staff. Wham-O Executive Vice-president Richard P. Knerr knew that fads are short-lived. \"Each Super Ball bounce is 92% as high as the last,\" he once said. \"If our sales don't come down any faster than that, we've got it made.\" Initially, the full-sized Super Ball sold for 98¢ at retail; by the end of 1966, its colorful miniature versions sold for as little as 10¢ in vending machines.\nIn the late 1960s, Wham-O made a giant Super Ball roughly the size of a bowling ball as a promotional stunt. It fell from the 23rd story window (some reports say the roof) of an Australian hotel and destroyed a parked convertible car on the second bounce.\n\nComposer Alcides Lanza purchased several Super Balls in 1965 as toys for his son, but soon he started experimenting with the sounds that they made when rubbed along the strings of a piano. This resulted in his composition \"Plectros III\" (1971), in which he specifies that the performer should use a pair of Super Balls on sticks as mallets with which to strike and rub the strings and case of a piano.\n\nLamar Hunt, founder of the American Football League, watched his children playing with a Super Ball and then coined the term Super Bowl. He wrote a letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle dated July 25, 1966: \"I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon.\" The leagues' owners decided on the name \"AFL-NFL Championship Game,\" but the media immediately picked up on Hunt's \"Super Bowl\" name, which became official beginning with the third annual game.\n\nAccording to one study \"If a pen is stuck in a hard rubber ball and dropped from a certain height, the pen may bounce to several times that height.\" If a Super Ball is dropped without spin onto a hard surface, with a small ball bearing on top of the Super Ball, the bearing rebounds to a great height.\n\nHigh school physics teachers use Super Balls to educate students on usual and unusual models of impacts.\n\nThe \"rough\" nature of a Super Ball makes its impact characteristics different from otherwise similar smooth balls. The resulting behavior is quite complex. The Super Ball has been used as an illustration of the principle of Time Reversal Invariance.\n\nA Super Ball is observed to reverse the direction of spin on each bounce. This effect depends on the tangential compliance and frictional effect in the collision. It cannot be explained by rigid body impact theory, and would not occur were the ball perfectly rigid. Tangential compliance is the degree to which one body clings to rather than slips over another at the point of impact.\n\n\n"}

The main entrance was in the left field corner at Jefferson Avenue to the east and Best Street to the south (behind right field). Its other boundaries were Dodge Street to the north (behind third base) and Masten Park to the west (behind first base) with Masten Avenue farther west. The east-west alignment of the football field was also unorthodox, running along the third base line. The elevation at street level is approximately above sea level.\n\nWar Memorial Stadium was built as a WPA project in 1937. It was originally named Roesch Memorial Stadium, though the name was changed to Grover Cleveland Stadium later in 1937 (honoring the former President and Buffalo public official) and then to Civic Stadium in 1938. The name was changed to War Memorial Stadium in 1960.\n\nThe stadium originally sat 35,000, but expansions raised the capacity to over 46,500.

After considering and rejecting a move to Seattle, the Bills left after the 1972 season for Rich Stadium (now New Era Field) in suburban Orchard Park, which had a capacity of over 80,000 in 1973.\n\nThe stadium hosted the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League, and later the National Football League from the unrelated Buffalo Bills of the AAFC from (\"Bisons\" in 1946), the Buffalo Indians and Chiefs of the third American Football League in 1940 and 1941, Canisius College's baseball and football teams, and baseball's Buffalo Bisons of the International League during the 1960s and again from 1979 to 1987 (as part of the Eastern League and American Association).\n\nThe stadium hosted three postseason professional football games, all in the American Football League.\n\n\nIn its later years, War Memorial Stadium was poorly maintained. Ron Fimrite, writing in \"Sports Illustrated\" in 1984, quoted another writer, Brock Yates, as having once said this stadium \"looks as if whatever war it was a memorial to had been fought within its confines.\" That look contributed to the oft-used nickname Buffalo residents gave it: \"The Rockpile\". Ironically, that worn-down look worked perfectly for the 1984 film \"The Natural\", about which Fimrite was writing. All of the baseball scenes in that movie were filmed here in 1983, except for the one scene set at Chicago's Wrigley Field, which was filmed at Buffalo's All-High Stadium. The movie was set in the late 1930s, when the stadium was new.\n\nThe stadium was deemed unsuitable for National Football League play after the AFL–NFL merger. As part of a deal with Congress clearing the way for the merger, the NFL declared stadiums seating fewer than 50,000 people were not suitable for league needs. War Memorial Stadium only seated 46,500 people at its height, and could not be expanded. This led to the Bills constructing what was then called Rich Stadium (now called New Era Field) in suburban Orchard Park and vacating War Memorial Stadium after the 1972 season.\n\nAfter the Bills' departure, the stadium sat dormant from 1973 to 1978. The last tenant of War Memorial Stadium was the Buffalo Bisons, a franchise revived in 1979 before moving to a new downtown stadium, known as Pilot Field, in 1988. The last major event at War Memorial Stadium was a Bisons game against the Nashville Sounds (the Sounds won, 7–5) on August 30, 1987; the game drew a capacity crowd of nearly 40,000 spectators. Following after the game was a slowpitch softball match between members of the Buffalo media. Doug Smith, a freelance newspaper columnist and WIVB-TV personality, led the winning team.\n\nWar Memorial Stadium was demolished shortly after the Bisons moved downtown to Pilot Field. A high school athletic field (Johnnie B. Wiley Amateur Athletic Sports Pavilion – c. 1997) remains at the old site and serves as one of Buffalo's three major high school football fields (the others being All-High Stadium and the field at Riverside Institute of Technology); the field also was the home of the Buffalo Gladiators, an adult amateur football team.\n\nThe northwest and southwest entrance to the old stadium was demolished, but the northeast and southeast entrance was saved and preserved. A small baseball diamond is on the former field's southwest corner.\n\n\n2. The site is currently used for grammar school track & field events.\n\n"}

Specifically as a drug-free alternative international platform – in order to provide fair competition world-wide for those powerlifters who wish to train and compete without performance-enhancing drugs. This remains as important today as it was when the Federation came into being. In pursuit of this objective the WDFPF has adopted the most rigorous drug control procedures in the world. That same rigor is demanded of all those national organizations affiliated to the WDFPF, as a pre-condition of their registration with the world body. It is the only international organization which makes such demands of its members, and this is the true measure of their dedication to the drug-free principle. The WDFPF was founded in 1988, its current president is Wim Backelant.\n\n\"The WDFPF offers both equipped and unequipped lifting. In the equipped division single ply bench shirts are allowed in polyester or denim. Canvas and open backed shirts are not allowed. Single ply lifting suits are allowed in polyester. Canvas and denim are not allowed. Briefs are not legal. Knee wraps are fine up to 2m\".\n\nPowerlifting - is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift.\n\nEquipped Competing - equipped lifters compete separately from raw lifters. Equipped lifters will wear a squat suit, knee wraps, a bench shirt, and a deadlift suit. These four things are the things that separate equipped lifters and raw lifters.\n\nUnequipped Competing or \"RAW\"- maintains strict guidelines regarding tools and accessories competitors may use during competition. The only equipment that is allowed in raw meets are wrist wraps, knee sleeves, and a weightlifting belt. \n\n(WDFPF)World Championship/World record holders within the federation\n\nSquat Unequipped Records\n\nSquat Equipped Records\n\nBench Unequipped Records\n\nBench Equipped\n\nDeadlift Unequipped Records\n\nDeadlift Equipped Records\n\nList of National Affiliates By Region\n\n-Australia\n\n-Belgium\n\n-Canada\n\n-Estonia\n\n-France\n\n-Germany\n\n-Great Britain\n\n-Ireland\n\n-Italy\n\n-Malta\n\n-Moldova\n\n-Russia\n\n-Switzerland\n\n-Turkmenistan\n\n-Ukraine\n\n-USA\n\nWebsite - http://www.wdfpf.co.uk/\n\nReference -\n\nPowerlifting\n"}

The WPFG Federation is an arm of the California Police Athletic Federation (CPAF), an American non-profit organization.\n\nThe Games attract approximately 10,000 entrants, slightly fewer than the Summer Olympic Games, and exceeding the third position holder, the Commonwealth Games. In the early 2010s, The United Kingdom hosted all three events consecutively; the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, followed by the 2013 World Police and Fire Games in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and ending with Glasgow, Scotland, hosting the 2014 Commonwealth Games - the first time all three events have been hosted by the same nation consecutively.\n\nThe host city of the 2015 World Police and Fire Game was Fairfax County, Virginia, in the United States, with venues located around the Washington metropolitan area.\n\nThe California Police Olympics were first held in 1967. The concept evolved over the years and led to the creation of the World Police & Fire Games Federation—a non-profit organization, run by the Californian Police Athletics Federation—in 1983. Two years later, in 1985, the first World Police & Fire Games were held in San Jose, California, USA, with nearly 5,000 competitors.\n\nThe largest WPFG games to date was held in New York, New York, USA with over 16,000 athletes in attendance, from 59 nations.\n\nThe most successful and best organised was in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 2013. It was described, by the President of the World Police and Fire Games Federation, Mike Graham, as \"the friendliest and best Games ever\".\n\nThe Montreal Firefighters Association has called for a boycott of the 2017 Games, which are to be held in their own city, in protest against forced changes to their collective agreements and pension funds by the City of Montreal and the Quebec provincial government. Labor unions representing over 100,000 firefighters and civil servants have joined Montreal's firefighters in this boycott.\n\n"}
