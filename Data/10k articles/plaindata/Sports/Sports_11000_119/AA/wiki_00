Originally, Cup of One Hundred Sovereigns, the value of the trophy was 100 pounds-sterling, hence its names, variations on 100 Pound Cup. The race was won by the yacht \"America\", leading to the trophy being renamed \"America's Cup\". The 1851 competition was the first to compete for the trophy now called the \"America's Cup\", hence the 1851 America's Cup or 0th America's Cup being zeroth, sequentially preceding the first America's Cup of 1870. The event \"The America's Cup\" would not be founded until 1857, when the deed of gift established the America's Cup racing regattas. The 1851 edition was a fleet race, unlike modern America's Cups finals, which are currently match races.\n\nThe race originated with an invitation for the Great Exhibition of 1851 by the Earl of Winton, then Commodore of the Royal Yacht Squadron (RYS), inviting the recently formed New York Yacht Club (NYYC) to enjoy the facilities of the clubhouse of the RYS. John Cox Stevens, Commodore of the NYYC responded positively, and anticipated racing. Due to the RYS rules of the time, other races in the 1851 RYS Regatta were restricted to RYS members and their self-owned yachts, so the R. Y. S. £100 Cup was established, open to anyone to enter. At a RYS meeting on 9 May 1851, the race was scheduled for 22 August 1851. This race was to be the first of a series of challenge races for successive £100 Cups. At the time, it was normal practise for the winners to own the cups that were won, and not to return them for the next race to be won by others.\n\nThe trophy, worth 100 sovereigns in 1851, latterly affectionately known as the Auld Mug, distinguishing it from the racing regatta of the same name.\n\nThe trophy, a bottomless ewer, is made out of of silver, and is tall. The ewer was a stock item obtained from jeweler Robert Garrard in 1848.\n\nAfter the race it was engraved with the names of the yachts that raced against America, save the runner-up, \"Aurora\".\n\nThe regatta, held on 22 August 1851, raced clockwise around the Isle of Wight in a fleet race. The course was called \"The Queen's Course\". The course was near Cowes Castle on the Isle of Wight, where the Royal Yacht Squadron headquarters are located. The race took place as part of the \"1851 Royal Yacht Squadron Regatta\". The signal gun for sailing was fired at 10am, and the winner saluted by a gun from the flag-ship at 8:34pm (8:37pm railway time).\n\n18 yachts were entered for the race, but only 15 yachts started the race. The yacht \"Fernande\" did not make the start, while \"Strella\" and \"Titania\" both got to the starting line, though did not start the race. Those yachts that raced were \"America\", \"Alarm\", \"Arrow\", \"Aurora\", \"Bacchante\", \"Beatrice\", \"Brilliant\", \"Constance\", \"Eclipse\", \"Freak\", \"Gipsy Queen\", \"Ione\", \"Mona\", \"Volante\", and \"Wyvern\".\n\nThe trophy would be renamed \"America's Cup\" after the yacht \"America\", that won the trophy. In 1857, the competition for \"America's Cup\" was declared, with the creation of the deed of gift. The first challenge would take place in 1870 under the deed of gift. This would initiate the oldest championship in sport.\n"}

It was held in San Juan, Puerto Rico from February 3 to February 9. The series featured four teams from Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. The hometown team, the Senadores de San Juan of the Puerto Rican League won the series. The team was managed by Luis Meléndez. The Most Valuable Player was Roberto Alomar, a second baseman with the Senadores de San Juan.\n\nWhile the San Juan club had faced difficulty in emerging as the champions of the Puerto Rican Winter League, the team swept its way through the six-game Series by a 49-15 score. The Azucareros del Este of the Dominican League lost one game 16-0 by Puerto Rico. However they won all of their games against the other teams thanks to the arms of José Rijo, Pedro Martínez and Pedro Astacio to place second with a 4-2 record.\n\nPuerto Rico was helped by having many major leaguers who normally would have taken off the time for spring training. Roberto Alomar (.560, 10 RBI, 9 R, .840 SLG, 2 SB) was the Series MVP and he was helped by Bernie Williams (.417, .875 SLG), Juan González (.375, .667 SLG), Edgar Martínez (.375, 9 RBI), Carlos Baerga, Rubén Sierra, a young Carlos Delgado hitting cleanup, Roberto Hernández, Rey Sánchez (.333), Doug Brocail (1-0, 1.00), José Alberro (1-0, 0.00 in 4 games), Eric Gunderson (1-0, 1.13), Ricky Bones and Chris Haney (2.45) among others.

It was reestablished by Augustus, in commemoration of his victory over Mark Antony off Actium in 31 BC; that it was probably the revival of an ancient festival is suggested by the celebrated temple of Apollo at Actium, which is mentioned by Thucydides, and Strabo, and which was enlarged by Augustus. The games instituted by Augustus were celebrated every four years (\"\", \"ludi quinquennales\"); they received the title of a sacred \"agon\" and were also called Olympia.\n\nThis ancient stadium was located in the so-called 'Proasteion' (sacred grove) of the Graeco-Roman city of Nikopolis. Together with the nearby gymnasion, theatre and hippodrome it was the location of the famous Actian Games. These games, which featured athletic, equestrian and musical events, were first held in 27 BCE to celebrate the victory of the first Roman emperor Augustus over his adversaries, Marc Antony and his Egyptian wife Cleopatra. They were held every four years up to the mid-3rd century CE.\n\nDating from just after the city's foundation, the ancient stadium of Nikopolis has two semicircular ends (\"sphendones\"), typical of the amphitheatre type that was in use during the first 200 years of the principate. The stadiums of ancient Laodikeia (near Pamukkale, Turkey) and Aphrodisias (Geyre, Turkey) have a similar architecture.\n\nThe north side of the stadium, which must have held a capacity of at least 10,000 spectators, was built on the side of a hill, while artificial deposits were used for the other sides. The walls were made of a rubble core faced with several courses of bricks. On the west side of the stadium were three apsidal entrances leading to the gymnasion, the central one larger than the others. The entrances in the \"sphendone\" at the east led to the theatre nearby. On the \"sphendone\" at the south side there were residential rooms and facilities for athletes and spectators (inns, shops, lodgings etc.)\n\nLocals call this stadium \"to karavi\", meaning 'the ship', which of course relates to the structure's shape. Archaeological investigations are still regularly undertaken in and around the stadium today.\n"}

Open to two-year-old horses, it is raced on turf over a distance of six furlongs.\n\nThe creation of James G. K. Lawrence, president of the Sheepshead Bay Race Track, the Futurity was originally run with the two-year-old offspring of mares which had been nominated before their birth. This rule remained in effect until 1957, when the race was opened to all two-year-old horses.\n\nThe Futurity was run as a turf race for the first time in 2018. It was added to the Breeders' Cup Challenge series for 2018 as a \"Win and You're In\" qualifier for the Juvenile Turf Sprint.\n\nThe first edition of the Futurity took place on Labor Day in 1888. \"The New York Times\" reported that one quarter of those in attendance were women. The richest race ever run in the United States to that time, the owners of winner Proctor Knott collected $41,675. Until 1956, this race had a larger purse than that of the Belmont Stakes.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported that attendance for the day of the inaugural running was at least the equal of the largest crowd to ever attend a race at the Sheepshead Bay facility and that the caterer sold the following food:\n\nThe Futurity Stakes was hosted by the Sheepshead Bay Race Track until the track's closure following a statewide ban on parimutuel betting through enactment of the Hart–Agnew Law by the New York Legislature. It was switched to the Saratoga Race Course for 1910 but was not raced for the next two years until the State Legislature lifted the ban. Held at Saratoga in 1913 and 1914, it was them moved to Belmont Park. In 1959 and 1960, plus from 1962 to 1967, the race was hosted by the Aqueduct Racetrack before returning to Belmont Park where it has since remained.\n\nThe race's counterpart on turf is the Laurel Futurity at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland. Prior to the advent of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, the Belmont Futurity was one of the United States' most important dirt races for two-year-olds. Some of the greatest Thoroughbreds in American racing history have won the race including Colin, Native Dancer, Man o' War and U.S. Triple Crown champions, Affirmed, Secretariat, and Citation.\n\nIn 2001, the race had been scheduled to be run on September 16 but was canceled following the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nOver the years the race has been contested at various distances:\n\nTime record: \n\nMost wins by an owner:\n\nMost wins by a jockey:\n\nMost wins by a trainer:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "330637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330637", "title": "Belmont Park", "text": "Belmont Park\n\nBelmont Park is a major Thoroughbred horse-racing facility in the northeastern United States, located in just east of the limits. Opened on May 4, 1905, it is operated by the non-profit New York Racing Association, as are Aqueduct and Saratoga Race Course. The group was formed in 1955 as the Greater New York Association to assume the assets of the individual associations that ran Belmont, Aqueduct, Saratoga, and the now-defunct Jamaica Racetrack.\n\nBelmont Park is typically open for racing from late April through mid-July (known as the Spring meet), and again from mid-September through late October (the Fall meet). It is widely-known as the home of the Belmont Stakes in early June, regarded as the \"Test of the Champion\", the third leg of the Triple Crown.\n\nAlong with Saratoga in Upstate New York, Keeneland and Churchill Downs in Kentucky, and Del Mar and Santa Anita in California, Belmont is considered one of the elite racetracks in North America.\n\nThe race park's main dirt track has earned the nickname, \"the Big Sandy,\" given its prominent overall dimensions and the deep, sometimes tiring surface. Belmont is also sometimes known as \"The Championship Track\" because almost every major champion in racing history since the early 20th century has competed on the racecourse – including all of the Triple Crown winners.\n\nBelmont hosted its largest crowd in 2004, when 120,139 saw Smarty Jones upset by Birdstone in its Triple Crown bid.\n\nAugust Belmont, Jr. and William Collins Whitney, along with other investors, built the original Belmont race track which opened on May 4, 1905. In its first 15 or so years, Belmont Park featured racing clockwise, in the \"English fashion\"—allowing the upper-class members of the racing association and their guests to have the races finish in front of the clubhouse, just to the west of the grandstand. (A \"field stand,\" at what was then the top of the stretch, was located east of the grandstand). The original finish line was located at the top of the present-day homestretch. In his 1925 book, \"The Big Town\", Ring W. Lardner refers to the then-recent directional change, when he has a character at Belmont say (speaking of a recent race) \"At that time, they run the wrong way of the track, like you would deal cards\".\n\nA later innovation was created by Joseph E. Widener, who took over track leadership when August Belmont II died in 1924: the Widener Chute. It was a straightaway of just under that cut diagonally through Belmont's training and main tracks, hitting near the quarter-pole of the main track; the course was removed in 1958.\n\nThere are presently two features of Old Belmont Park remaining today. First is the display of four stone pillars on Hempstead Turnpike, a gift from the mayor and park commissioners of Charleston, South Carolina. The pillars had stood at the entrance of the Washington Course of the South Carolina Jockey Club in Charleston, which operated from 1792 to 1882. The stone pillars are now found at the clubhouse entrance. Lesser known-but more visible-are the racing motif iron railings seen partially bordering the walking ring. The railings, used as decoration on the south side of the old Belmont grandstand, were salvaged during the 1963 demolition.\n\nThe original Belmont Park was not only unprecedented in its size, but also had the then-new innovation of a Long Island Rail Road extension from the Queens Village station, running along the property, tunneling under Hempstead Turnpike, then terminating on the south side of the property. The train terminal was moved to its present location north of the turnpike after the 1956 season.\n\nNear the railroad terminal was yet \"another\" track—Belmont Park Terminal, a steeplechase course operated by United Hunts until 1927.\n\nIn addition to racing history, Belmont Park made history in another industry native to the Hempstead Plains – aviation. Some 150,000 people were drawn to the track in 1910 on October 30, at the climax of a Wright Brothers-staged international aerial tournament, which had started eight years earlier. The event came at the beginning of a period (1910, 1911, and 1912) in which racing was outlawed in New York State.\n\nEight years later, Belmont and aviation were reunited when the racetrack served as the northern point of the first U.S. air mail route, between the New York area and Washington, D.C.\n\nToday, two displays in the clubhouse of the current Belmont Park commemorate the history of the racetrack: a long mural by Pierre Bellocq featuring the dominant jockeys, trainers and racing personalities of the track's history; and a series of paintings of Old Belmont Park that were featured at a nearby restaurant before the eatery closed.\n\nThe last race at the old Belmont Park was run in October 1962. The following spring, NYRA Chairman James Cox Brady announced that two separate engineering surveys found the grandstand/clubhouse was unsafe due to age-induced structural defects and needed to be rebuilt. The book \"Belmont Park: A Century of Champions\" noted the comment of NYRA President Edward T. Dickinson: \"When you sighted down the stands, you could see some of the beams were twisted. They were in something of an S-shape.\"\n\nThe old structure was demolished in 1963. The new grandstand was built 1964–1968. (The Inner Turf Course was also added during this time.) The Belmont race meetings were moved to Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park, Queens, during that time.\n\nThe new $30.7 million Belmont Park grandstand, designed by Arthur Froehlich, was opened May 20, 1968 and is the largest in Thoroughbred racing. It has a total attendance capacity of more than 100,000, with the adjoining backyard being able to accommodate more than 10,000. The seating portion totals nearly 33,000. (Ironically, the smaller, more cramped Churchill Downs grandstand has more seats than Belmont, 51,000.) Unlike Churchill and Pimlico, Belmont does not allow paying spectators to picnic in the infield.\n\nIn May 2007, reports surfaced suggesting that then New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was considering closing Aqueduct Racetrack, which is ten miles west of Belmont in Ozone Park, New York, and turning Belmont into a nearly year 'round race track when the New York Racing Association lease for all three of New York State's tracks expired at the end of 2007. According to the plans being discussed, Belmont's stands would be heated, additional barns built for Aqueduct's 400 horses, and the track modified to accommodate winter racing. In addition, video lottery machines would be introduced. A new entity would operate Belmont from fall to spring while the New York Racing Association would operate Saratoga Race Course in the summer. Any plans the former governor might have had for the track alignment likely left office with him when Spitzer was forced to resign amid a prostitution scandal in March 2008.\n\nIn July 2017, New York State officials announced that vacant parking lots behind the Belmont grandstand had been put to tender for two area top-level professional sports teams: the New York Islanders, an NHL professional hockey team; and New York City FC, an MLS soccer team. Both teams were unhappy with their current locations (the Islanders at Barclays Center; New York City FC Yankee Stadium) and proposed to redevelop the land into their own stadiums. The Islanders proposed an 18,000 seat sports arena, 435,000 square feet for retail development, a 225-room hotel, and a 10,000-sq ft community center, while NYCFC's pledge included a 26,000 seat soccer ground, 400,000 sq ft for retail, a 5.2 acre community park, and 2 acre soccer complex: both proposals were fully privately funded and included improved parking and LIRR facilities as well. On December 20, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the Islanders project had won approval to be built, and the Belmont Park Arena will be opened in time for the 2020-21 hockey season. However, the New York City FC proposal was rejected.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes was named after financier and sportsman August Belmont, Sr., who helped fund the race, and most sources say the racetrack itself was also named for him. Other sources say Belmont Park was named in honor of his son—August Belmont II, a key member of the Westchester Racing Association, which established the racecourse.\n\nThe race was first run in 1867 at Jerome Park Racetrack in the Bronx. In 1937, the wrought iron gates that bore an illustration of that first Belmont Stakes were donated to the track by August Belmont II's sole surviving son, Perry Belmont. The gates are now on the fourth floor of Belmont Park's clubhouse.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes races have been run at Belmont Park since 1905, with the exceptions of 1911–12, when gambling was banned in New York State; and the 1963–67 editions, held at Aqueduct while the grandstands at Belmont Park were reconstructed. The first post parade in the United States was at the 14th Belmont, in 1880.\nSecretariat's finishing time in his 1973 Belmont victory (2 minutes, 24 seconds) set a world record for on dirt, a world record which still stands. The 31-length victory clinched the first Triple Crown in 25 years, dating back to Citation in 1948. A statue of Secretariat is in the center of the Belmont paddock.\n\nAnother Belmont Stakes achievement is recognized by the \"Woody's Corner\" display in the first-floor clubhouse lobby, commemorating the five consecutive Belmont Stakes winners trained by Woody Stephens from 1982 to 1986.\n\nOther memorable performances in Belmont Park history include the opening of the track in 1905 with the famous dead heat between Sysonby and Race King in the Met Cap. In 1923, Belmont Park was host to an international duel between the American and English champions: Zev, winner of the Kentucky Derby, against Papyrus, winner of The Derby. Zev won by five lengths in front of the biggest crowd for a match race in a hundred years.\n\nBelmont Park was the site of the tragedy-marred victory of Foolish Pleasure over champion filly Ruffian in a 1975 match race. Ruffian broke down during the race and had to be euthanized; she is buried near the finish line in the infield at Belmont Park, her nose pointed towards the finish pole.\n\nThe racetrack was also the site of Affirmed's epic stretch duel with Alydar in the 1978 Belmont Stakes, a victory that gave Affirmed the Triple Crown; and Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew's defeat of Affirmed in the Marlboro Cup in September of that same year. The Marlboro, a key event of the Fall Championship meets in the 1970s and 1980s, included a dramatic come-from-behind win by Forego in the 1976 installment.\n\nOfficials of the New York Racing Association made a concerted effort to boost attendance on Belmont Stakes Day after the 1995 installment drew only 37,171. In 1997, NYRA and local officials put together the Long Island Belmont Stakes Festival—featuring parades, food fests and other events in surrounding communities to promote the big race. The effort succeeded in creating a buzz around the Belmont Stakes apart from the chance of seeing a Triple Crown. The 2000 and 2001 Belmonts—both run when there was no Triple Crown on the line—drew announced crowds of 67,810 and 73,857. The Belmont Stakes Festival continues to be held in communities near the track, such as Floral Park and Garden City. In 2004, a record attendance of 120,139 was on hand to see if Smarty Jones would be the first Triple Crown winner since 1978.\n\nAmerican Pharoah won the 2015 Belmont Stakes on June 6, and became the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years. It was announced before the race that attendance would be capped at 90,000. That year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness both set attendance records, over 170,000 and 130,000 respectively.\n\nBelmont Park also has a history of early aviation shows and tournaments that dates back to the early 1900s.\n\nHarriet Quimby, the first USA woman to obtain a pilot's license, learned of the excitement of flight at the Belmont Park International Aviation Tournament on Long Island, New York in 1910 where she met famed aviator John Moisant and his sister.\n\nIn addition to the Belmont Stakes, other major races held at Belmont have included the Jockey Club Gold Cup, the Woodward Stakes, the Suburban Handicap and the Memorial Day standby—the Metropolitan Handicap, also known as the \"Met Mile.\" (NYRA moved the Woodward to Saratoga Race Course, in 2006.)\n\nTwo important races for fillies, the Mother Goose Stakes and the Coaching Club American Oaks, are also run at Belmont as the first two installments of the New York Racing Association's Triple Tiara series for fillies. The third is the Alabama Stakes, run at Saratoga. In years past, the New York Filly Triple Crown consisted of the Mother Goose, CCA Oaks and another Belmont race, the Acorn Stakes (which is still run at the track).\n\nAll of the above races are contested on dirt; notable turf (grass) races include the Belmont Derby, Belmont Oaks, Manhattan Handicap, Just A Game Handicap, Bowling Green Handicap, Man O' War Stakes, Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes and the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational.\n\nBelmont's Fall Championship meet includes New York Showcase Day in late October, with seven stakes races for New York-bred horses. The richest race on that program is the $250,000 Empire Classic Handicap.\n\nRacing at Belmont Park is conducted in two annual installments, or \"meetings\": The \"spring-summer meeting,\" which usually begins on the second Wednesday in May and lasts through the fourth Sunday in July, followed by a \"fall meeting\" commencing on the Friday after Labor Day and ending the fourth Sunday in October. Racing is held at Saratoga Race Course, during the time between these two meetings. Prior to 1977 a summer meeting was contested at Aqueduct from mid-June until the Saratoga meet began; its abolition led to the Belmont spring meeting being lengthened to its present duration (and eventual renaming).\n\nThe autumn installment is known as the Fall Championship meet, since many of the eventual Eclipse Award title winners have earned key victories in some of the meeting's races, such as the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Before the advent of the Breeders' Cup series in the mid-1980s, the Belmont Fall Championship races themselves helped determine the divisional championships.\n\nBelmont has been home to the daylong Breeders' Cup championship in 1990, 1995, 2001 (the first major sports event to be held after the September 11 Attacks in the metropolitan area) and most recently in 2005.\n\nBelmont's backyard is well known as a gathering place for racing fans to see their horses saddled before they hit the track. The center of the paddock is dominated by a white pine that predated the track itself—it turned 180 years old in 2006. A stylized version of the pine has been the centerpiece of Belmont Park's corporate logo since 1968.\n\nThe racing, training and barn complex is located on the western edge of the Nassau County region known as the Hempstead Plains. Just a few miles (kilometers) east on the same plains, the first racing meet in North America was held in 1665, supervised by colonial governor Richard Nicolls.\n\nThe dirt racecourse, known officially as the \"Main Track\" and nicknamed \"Big Sandy\" by racing followers, has a circumference of , the longest dirt thoroughbred racetrack in North America. Immediately inside of this is the \"Widener Turf Course\" (named after the Widener family that has a long and prestigious history in American horse racing) spanning plus , which in turn encircles an \"Inner Turf Course\" with a circumference of plus . On the Main Track, it is from the top of the stretch to the finish line, and the segment between the wire and the start of the first (clubhouse) turn covers ; this latter segment is shorter by approximately on both of the turf courses, in order to accommodate the two chutes that exist on the Widener Turf Course, from which turf races of and are started; an additional chute exists for races of on the Inner Turf Course.\n\nA straightaway chute leads on to the backstretch of the Main Track and permits races on the dirt up to long to be run with one turn. The chute used to extend further back across the training track, permitting races of up to a mile and a quarter, but was shortened because a crossover is now infeasible given the clay base of the Main Track and stone-dust base of the training track. Before the 1990 Breeders' Cup, the outer rail of the Main Track was moved back to widen the middle of the clubhouse turn and soften the angle of the start of the Classic. The training track is in circumference and abuts the east end of the main track. In March 2009, lights were added to the training track as a safety measure to prevent early morning workouts from occurring in the dark.\n\nThe racetrack, grandstand, training, and barn facilities are located entirely in the community of Elmont in Nassau County, New York. According to the City of New York's own map portal, the Long Island Rail Road station on the property, the ramp between the grandstand and the train station, and some of the adjoining parking fields straddle the Queens County line.\n\nBelmont Park has direct on- and off-ramps to the Cross Island Parkway, which runs north-south and is just to the west of the park. Belmont Park's physical address is given as 2150 Hempstead Turnpike (New York State Route 24).\n\nThe Belmont Park property originally totaled some . Because the property stretched slightly into Queens, bookmakers in the track's early days—when bookmaking was illegal—could escape arrest from one county's authorities by jumping over the border. It was once even believed that horses rounding the far turn crossed into Queens and then came back to Nassau for the stretch run. After the 1956 season, the construction of a wider bus road beyond the main course's final turn forced the turn to be shortened. According to the Belmont publication commemorating the track's 1968 reopening, that move cut off its circumference. The current layout has the entire racing course inside Nassau County.\n\nBecause of Belmont's role hosting big, nationally televised races on broadcast and cable TV, its track announcers have been among the best known in the sport. Among the famous race callers who've served as Belmont PA announcers are Fred Capossela, Dave Johnson, Chic Anderson, Marshall Cassidy, Tom Durkin, and present voice Larry Collmus.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Johnson, not Anderson, was Belmont Park's PA announcer during Secretariat's 1973 romp in the Belmont Stakes. It was on TV that Anderson called the 1973 Belmont Stakes aired by CBS Television, where he famously described Big Red as \"moving like a tremendous machine\". Anderson was the TV \"voice of horse racing\" in the 1970s and the announcer at Churchill Downs during Secretariat's racing career. Johnson went on to be TV's voice of horse racing in the 1990s.\n\nAnderson would succeed Johnson as announcer at Belmont and the other NYRA tracks in May 1977, serving until his death on March 24, 1979. Anderson was followed by frequent backup voice Marshall Cassidy, who was the lead caller of NYRA races until Durkin replaced him in September 1990.\n\nSources: New York Racing Association (NYRA), City of New York\n\n\nComedian Robert Klein made Capossella's race calls the subject of one of his routines, captured on his 1974 album \"Mind Over Matter.\"\n\nScenes for the Woody Allen movies \"Mighty Aphrodite\" (1995) and \"Melinda and Melinda\" (2004) were shot at Belmont Park, as was a paddock scene for the 1990s remake of the film \"Gloria\" with Sharon Stone and George C. Scott.\n\nScenes for the movie \"St. Vincent\" (2014) starring Bill Murray were shot at Belmont Park.\n\nBelmont has hosted a wide range of top musical acts including Billy Joel, Kenny Rogers, Natalie Cole and Blondie. Titled the Coca-Cola Sunset Series, these fan based events were produced by music impresario, Richard Flanzer.\n\nA January 1975 episode of the ABC sitcom \"The Odd Couple\" — entitled \"Felix the Horse Player\"—was filmed partly at Belmont Park, though one of the race clips on the show features the shot of an Aqueduct starting gate.\n\nA few years later, Dick Cavett took the camera crew of his PBS talk show to Belmont for a look at horse racing.\n\nBelmont Park was featured in an episode of \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", in which Frank, Robert, and Ray bet on a horse named \"Marie's Mouth\".\n\nBelmont Park was featured on season finale of \"The Amazing Race 27\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "73109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73109", "title": "Camogie", "text": "Camogie\n\nCamogie (; ) is an Irish stick-and-ball team sport played by women; it is almost identical to the game of hurling played by men. Camogie is played by 100,000 women in Ireland and worldwide, largely among Irish communities.\nIt is organised by the Dublin-based Camogie Association or An Cumann Camógaíochta. UNESCO lists Camogie as an element of Intangible Cultural Heritage.\n\nThe game consists of 2 thirty-minute halves. There is a half time interval of 10 minutes. In event of extra time halves must consist of 10 minutes each. Each team has 15 players on the field. Within the 15 players the team must consist of 1 goal keeper, 3 full back players, 3 half back players, 2 centre-field players, 3 half forward players and 3 full forward players. There is a minimum requirement of 12 players on the pitch at all times.\n\nThe field is not of a fixed size, but must be between 130m long by 80m wide, and 145m long by 90m wide.\n\nH-shaped goals are used. A team achieves a score by making the ball go between the posts. If the ball goes over the bar for a \"point\", the team earns 1-point. If the ball goes under the bar for a \"goal\", the team earns a 3-points.\n\nThe annual All Ireland Camogie Championship has a record attendance of 33,154 while average attendances in recent years are in the region of 15,000 to 18,000. The final is televised live, with a TV audience of over 300,000 being claimed.\n\nThe rules are almost identical to hurling, with a few exceptions.\n\nCamogie players must wear skirts or skorts rather than shorts.\n\nExperimental rules were drawn up in 1903 for a female stick-and-ball game by Máire Ní Chinnéide, Seán (Sceilg) Ó Ceallaigh, Tadhg Ó Donnchadha and Séamus Ó Braonáin. The Official Launch of Camogie took place with the first public match between Craobh an Chéitinnigh (Keatings branch of the Gaelic League) and Cúchulainns on 17 July at a Feis in Navan. The sport's governing body, the Camogie Association or An Cumann Camógaíochta was founded in 1905 and re-constituted in 1911, 1923 and 1939. Until June 2010 it was known as Cumann Camógaíochta na nGael.\n\nMáire Ní Chinnéide and Cáit Ní Dhonnchadha, two prominent Irish-language enthusiasts and cultural nationalists, were credited with having created the sport, with the assistance of Ní Dhonnchadha's scholarly brother Tadhg Ó Donnchadha, who drew up its rules. Thus, although camogie was founded by women, and independently run (although closely linked to the GAA), there was, from the outset, a small yet powerful male presence within its administrative ranks. It was no surprise that camogie emanated from the Gaelic League, nor that it would be dependent upon the structures and networks provided by that organisation during the initial expansion of the sport. Of all the cultural nationalist organisations for adults that emerged during the fin de siècle, the Gaelic League was the only one to accept female and male members on an equal footing.\n\nUnder Séamus Ó Braonáin's original 1903 camogie rules both the match and the field were shorter than their hurling equivalents. Matches were 40 minutes, increased to 50 minutes in 1934, and playing fields 125–130 yards (114-119m) long and 65–70 yards (59-64m) wide. From 1929 until 1979 a second crossbar, a \"points bar\" was also used, meaning that a point would not be allowed if it travelled over this bar, a somewhat contentious rule through the 75 years it was in use. Teams were regulated at 12 a side, using an elliptical formation (1–3–3–3–1) although it was more a \"squeezed lemon\" formation with the three midfield players grouped more closely together than their counterpart on the half back and half-forward lines. In 1999 camogie moved to the GAA field-size and 15-a-side, adopting the standard GAA butterfly formation (3–3–2–3–3).\n\nThe name was invented by Tadhg Ua Donnchadha (Tórna) at meetings in 1903 in advance of the first matches in 1904.\n\nMen play using a curved stick called in Irish a \"camán\". Women would use a shorter stick, at one stage described by the diminutive form \"camóg\". The suffix -\"aíocht\" (originally \"uidheacht\") was added to both words to give names for the sports: \"camánaíocht\" (which became \"iománaíocht\") and \"camógaíocht\". When the Gaelic Athletic Association was founded in 1884 the English-origin name \"hurling\" was given to the men's game. When an organisation for women was set up in 1904, it was decided to anglicise the Irish name \"camógaíocht\" to \"camogie\".\n\nAn Cumann Camógaíochta has a similar structure to the Gaelic Athletic Association, with an Annual Congress every spring which decides on policy and major issues such as rule changes, and an executive council, the Árd Chómhairle which deals with short-term issues and governance. The game is administered from a headquarters in Croke Park in Dublin. Each of 28 county boards takes control of its own affairs (all of the Irish counties except Fermanagh, Leitrim and Sligo), with the number of clubs ranging from 58 in Cork to one in Leitrim. There are four provincial councils and affiliates in Asia, Australia, Britain, Europe, New York, New Zealand and North America.\n\nThere are 537 camogie clubs, of which 513 (95.5%) are based on the island of Ireland, 47 in Connacht (8.8%), 195 in Leinster (36.4%), 160 in Munster (29.8%), and 110 in Ulster (20.5%).\n\nThe county is the unit of structure in elite competition, responsible for organising club competitions within the county unit and for fielding inter-county teams in the various grades of the All-Ireland championships and National Camogie League.\n\nThe National League is staged during the winter-spring months, with four divisions of team graded by ability.\n\nProvincial championships take place at all levels, independent of the All Ireland series which has been run on an open draw basis since 1973.\n\nIreland plays a camogie-shinty international against Scotland each year. The Gael Linn Cup is an inter-provincial competition played at senior and junior level. The sport is closely associated with the Celtic Congress. Two former Camogie Association presidents Máire Ní Chinnéide and Agnes O'Farrelly were also presidents of Celtic Congress and exhibition matches have been held at the Celtic Congress since 1938. The first such exhibition match, on the Isle of Man in 1938, marked the first appearance of Kathleen Cody, who became one of the stars of the 1940s.\n\nThe Ashbourne and Purcell Cups and Father Meachair seven-a-side are the principal inter-collegiate competitions.\n\nThere is also a programme of provincial and All Ireland championships at secondary schools senior and junior levels, differentiated by the years of secondary school cycle, with years 4–6 competing in the senior competition, and years 1–3 competing at junior level. Cumann na mBunscoil organises competitions at primary school level.\n\nCamogie competitions for club teams featuring under-14 players are played in four divisions as part of the annual Féile na nGael festival. The county that is selected for a particular year, all their clubs host teams from all around the country representing their county. Host clubs get families to take in two or three children for a couple of days.\n\nCork have won the most Camogie All-Ireland titles a with 27 the last being in 2017.

It is located on the south side of 21st Street, east of Hillside, on the campus of Wichita State University in northeast Wichita.\n\nCessna is currently the home of the Shocker track and field team. Before the WSU football program was discontinued, the Shocker football team played home games at this stadium.\n\nIn the early days of Wichita State University, when it was known as Fairmount College, its first football field was located on the north side of 17th Street, immediately east of the current Henrion Hall, when it was the Henrion Gymnasium. In 1929, concrete bleachers were attached to the east side of the same building for football games.\n\nIn 1940, the school decided to build a new football stadium on the north side of campus at the current site on the south side of 21st Street. On January 6, 1941, ground was broken for Veterans Field, and by September 1942 the bowl was excavated, foundations were poured for the west stands, and a quarter of the west bleachers were completed, however construction was halted due to metal shortages during World War II. After the war ended, the bleachers were constructed in sections over time as funds were incrementally available. By mid-1946, stands were completed to a point where 6,000 seats were ready by the start of the 1946 football season. Veterans Field was finally completed before the start of the 1948 football season, with 15,000 seats and facilities for the press, concessions stands, and locker rooms. It was dedicated on November 25, 1948 during a football game with the University of Nevada. The stadium was dedicated to the members of the armed forces from Sedgwick County who served in World War II.\n\n1n 1967, Wichita State started considering the expansion of Veterans Field. In 1968, faculty and students voted and approved the expansion by adding on top of the existing stands of Veterans Field. Cessna Aircraft Company pledged a donation of $300,000 for the proposed stadium, and it was renamed to Cessna Stadium. The cost of the expansion was $1.5 Million, and the school had a fund drive to raise the remaining money. Construction was started on February 7, 1969 and completed in September. It was one of the most modern and complete football facilities in the nation at the time of its completion.\n\nWichita State University rededicated the facility on April 16, 2002 to mark the end of the seven-month, $1.3 million construction that included adding an eighth lane and resurfacing the track, reconfiguring the infield event layout, and building separate locker rooms for the Shocker men's and women's track and field teams. The first event in the renovated facility was WSU's annual K.T. Woodman Track and Field Classic, which is scheduled every April.\n\nThe Wichita State Shockers football team was a NCAA Division I football program. The Shockers fielded a team from 1897 to 1986. They played home games at Cessna Stadium and were members of the Missouri Valley Conference when the program was discontinued in 1986.\n\nCessna was the location of a Pittsburg State-Mesa State Division II college football game. The stadium has also played host to numerous Kansas State High School Football Championship games, including the Kansas Shrine Bowl, Kansas's high school all-star football game, High School football games from nearby Kapaun Mt. Carmel High School.\n\nWichita State Shockers track and field currently uses the facilities, as well as several Missouri Valley Conference Track and Field Championship meets.\n\nIn April of each year, Cessna Stadium is the venus for the K.T. Woodman Classic, a track and field meet for high schools, junior colleges, and many top collegiate track programs of the midwest.\n\nCessna is used by Kapaun Mount Carmel High School of the Greater Wichita Athletic League as its \"home field\" for varsity football games. Other high school games are played at Cessna Stadium from time to time.\n\nCessna Stadium is open to the public for recreational use Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. It is closed on holidays and during WSU track & field practices and special events. In April 2017, WSU decided to change their policy, a $100 deposit is now required to get a key to use their facilities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34063314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34063314", "title": "Lightning football", "text": "Lightning football\n\nLightning football is a shortened variation of Australian rules football, often played at half of the duration of a full match.\n\nLightning football is typically used as a means to accommodate a small tournament inside a single day or weekend, particularly at junior or amateur level; these tournaments are generally known as lightning premierships or lightning carnivals. At the top level of Australian rules football, lightning matches have most recently been staged as part of the Australian Football League pre-season competition.\n\nLightning football is distinct from AFLX, a different shortened variation of Australian rules football. Lightning football is not significantly different from standard Australian rules football other than the length of its games, while AFLX is a heavily modified variant played with on a smaller field with fewer players.\n\nThe use of the word \"lightning\", as a synonym for \"fast\", to describe an Australian rules football tournament appears to have originated with the first lightning carnival staged by the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) in 1940. The term may have been adopted from its use in chess, which had used the word \"lightning\" in the same context for many years: \"lightning chess\" tournaments were seen in Australia from as early as 1909, and were played under modified rules in which players were allowed at most ten seconds to make each move, allowing an entire tournament to be completed in just a few hours.\n\nIn a preview of the 1940 SANFL Lightning Carnival, \"the Advertiser\" journalist Jim Handby discussed the suitability of the name; while he surmised that the choice of name was primarily due to the short time over which the premiership was decided, he speculated that the shortened matches could lead to a particularly high-paced style of gameplay.\n\nThe term \"lightning premiership/carnival\" has generally entered the Australian vernacular for a condensed carnival of shortened matches in any game or sport. The term was, for example, attributed to a 1945 South Australian seven-a-side rugby union tournament, long before the sport of rugby sevens was formally codified.\n\nUnlike other abbreviated sports, such as Twenty20 cricket, rugby sevens or Australian rules football's AFLX, lightning football is not a strictly codified sport in its own right. In many cases, the length of the game is the only difference in the rules between the full and lightning versions of the game; in other cases, some rules are modified for lightning matches.\n\nMost commonly, lightning matches are played at half of the length of a regulation game. In the most recent lightning matches in the Australian Football League (AFL) pre-season competition, lightning matches are played over two halves, each lasting 20 minutes with time on, compared with the normal match length of four quarters each lasting 20 minutes with time-on. However, this varies from tournament to tournament, and the length is often simply adjusted based on the number of games required to be played and the time available to play them in.\n\nIn more recent incarnations of lightning football organised by the AFL, several experimental rules, many designed to speed up the game, have been trialled. The most notable variation was the introduction of a free kick paid against the last player to touch the ball before it goes out of bounds (except from a spoil or smother), rather than restarting play with a boundary throw-in; this rule was used in the AFL's 1996 and 2011 lightning matches, and as revised in 2012 to penalise a player only if the last touch was a kick, handpass, or crossing the line while in possession of the ball.\n\nThe concept of holding a one-day tournament of shortened Australian rules football matches dates as early as the 19th century. During a weekend's break in the 1896 VFA premiership season, a Charity Cup event was held in which four clubs – , , and Port Melbourne – contested a knock-out tournament of shortened matches; as is the case in modern lightning premierships, new rules were trialled during the event.\n\nLightning premierships saw an increase in frequency around World War II, when many such events were staged as wartime fundraisers. The first occurred during 1940, the first football season following the outbreak of World War II. On 13 July 1940, the SANFL staged its \"Lightning Football Carnival\" at the Adelaide Oval, attracting a crowd of almost 17,500 people, with Sturt victorious; the carnival was an eight-team knock-out tournament, with each match played over two periods of 14 minutes each. The Victorian Football League then staged its version, known as the \"Patriotic Premiership\", on 3 August 1940, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, attracting more than 30,000 people, and won by ; this was a twelve-team knock-out tournament, with each match lasting a single period of 20 minutes. Both tournaments were considered great successes, and both leagues held further wartime Lightning Premierships in 1941 and 1943.\n\nIn addition to the sport's two biggest leagues, the Tasmanian Australian National Football League (TANFL) held two wartime Lightning Premierships, both in 1941, and many smaller leagues also held events. Most notably, the Broken Hill Football League, staged a \"Patriotic Premiership\" on 6 July 1940, one week before the inaugural SANFL event, which consisted of a four-team knock-out tournament, with matches played at just under half-length (two periods of twenty minutes without time-on).\n\nIn the ten years following World War II, most of the major Australian rules football leagues sporadically held lightning premierships. Although there was no longer a war to fund, the events were still held as charity fundraisers. The SANFL was the most active proponent of lightning football, staging four post-war carnivals between 1946 and 1950; the VFL staged lightning premierships on public holidays in 1951 (Jubilee Day), 1952 (Empire Day) and 1953 (Coronation Day); and post-war lightning premierships were also staged by the Victorian Football Association (1946), the North Western Football Union (1951) and the TANFL (1953).\n\nSince the 1950s, lightning football has been seen only occasionally at the top levels of the sport. Specific events have included:\n\nAmong the more notable senior lightning football events around Australia are:\n\nAnnual lightning carnivals have become common in many junior leagues and school competitions. This is not limited to Australian rules football, with many other sports contested under a lightning premiership format.\n\nThis table lists winners of stand-alone lightning premiership series played in the major Australian state leagues.\n"}

{"id": "1228380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1228380", "title": "Overtraining", "text": "Overtraining\n\nOvertraining occurs when a person exceeds their body's ability to recover from strenuous exercise. Overtraining can be described as a point where a person may have a decrease in performance and plateauing as a result of failure to consistently perform at a certain level or training load; a load which exceeds their recovery capacity. People who are overtrained cease making progress, and can even begin to lose strength and fitness. Overtraining is also known as chronic fatigue, burnout and overstress in athletes. It is suggested that there are different variations of overtraining, firstly monotonous program over training suggest that repetition of the same movement such as certain weight lifting and baseball batting can cause performance plateau due to an adaption of the central nervous system which results from a lack of stimulation. A second example of overtraining is described as chronic overwork type training where the subject may be training with too high intensity or high volume and not allowing sufficient recovery time for the body. Up to 10% of elite endurance athletes and 10% of American college swimmers are affected by overtraining syndrome (unexplained underperformance for approximately 2 weeks even after having adequate resting time).\n\nListed below are some of the common effects and cited signs of overtraining.\n\nOvertraining may be accompanied by one or more concomitant symptoms:\n\nIt is important to note the difference between overtraining and over-reaching; over-reaching is when an athlete is undergoing hard training but with adequate recovery, overtraining however, is when an athlete is undergoing hard training without the adequate recovery. With over-reaching, the consequential drop in performance can be resolved in a few days or weeks.\n\n\nIt is also important to remember that the effect of overtraining is not isolated only to affecting the athlete's athletic ability but it can have implications on other areas of life such as performance in studies or the work force. An overtrained athlete who is suffering from physical and or psychological symptoms could also have trouble socialising with friends and family, studying for an exam or prepping for work.\n\nLike pharmacological drugs, physical exercise may be chemically addictive. Addiction can be defined as, the frequent engaging in the behavior to a greater extent or for a longer time period than intended. It is theorized that this addiction is due to natural endorphins and dopamine generated and regulated by the exercise. Whether strictly due to this chemical by-product or not, some people can be said to become addicted to or fixated on psychological/physical effects of physical exercise and fitness. This may lead to overexercise, resulting in the \"overtraining\" syndrome.\n\nA number of possible mechanisms for overtraining have been proposed:\n\nAllowing more time for the body to recover:\n\n\nSeeing as there are many non beneficial results of overtraining and the main treatment is taking time out to rest, so to avoid taking time off training prevention is very important for many athletes. An additional method preferred by many collegiate and professional level athletes is the incorporation of active recovery into training. The gradual varying of intensity and volume of training is an effective way to prevent overtraining. The athlete should be closely monitored by keeping records of weight, diet and heart rate and the training program should be adjusted in accordance to different physical and emotional stresses.\n\nAlong with the recording of rest, diet, weight and heart rates, there are multiple training types that can assist with ensuring that over training is not occurring.\n\nInterval training ensures that, even though they are short, rest periods during training are taken. The “periods of high intensity and low intensity” mixed characteristics of interval training enable athletes to ensure they are including rest and allowing the body to rest or repair in between intervals and in between each stage of a training session.\n\nAustralian rowers “require a mix of technique, power and endurance of both the aerobic and anaerobic energy systems” follow a strict training schedule to enable them to ensure that rest is taken into count to ensure that overtraining is not present. “Train upwards of 11 months of the year” this large volume of training is well spaced and thought out to avoid over training symptoms.\n"}

{"id": "20169861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20169861", "title": "Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship", "text": "Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship\n\nThe Pan-American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship is the foremost intercollegiate team chess championship in the Americas. Hosted in part by the United States Chess Federation, the Pan-Am Intercollegiate is open to any team comprising four players and up to two alternates from the same post-secondary school (university, college, community college) in North America, Central America, South America, or the Caribbean. The Pan-Am began as such in 1946 (there had been earlier versions open to U.S. schools only), and is held annually, usually December 27–30. It has usually been held in the United States, but was hosted in Canada four times (1969, 1971, 1984, 1999). The current format is a six-round fixed-roster team Swiss-system tournament scored by team (not individual) points. Sometimes the Pan-Am Intercollegiate is held as part of a larger event called the Pan-American Chess Championships comprising the Pan-Am Intercollegiate, Pan-Am Scholastic Team Championship, and Pan-Am Open (for any individual).\n\nFor many years this tournament was, in effect, a national (or continental) championship. For a few years in the 1970s, the Continental Chess Association held a rival intercollegiate tournament, but that was discontinued. The Pan-Am should not be confused with the Campeonato PanAmericano de Ajedrez Universitario (PanAmerican University Chess Championships), which has been held since 2006 by the Confederación De Ajedrez Para America.\n\nSince 2001, a separate invitational team tournament has been held: the top four finishing US schools in the Pan-Am advance to the President's Cup (informally known as the \"Final Four of College Chess\" and typically held in the first weekend of April), which determines the US National College or University Champion.\n\nThe governing body for the Pan-Am is the College Chess Committee (CCC) of the United States Chess Federation (USCF). The CCC ratified a set of guidelines for the Pan-Am in 1992, which have been amended by various resolutions of the CCC, most recently in 2015. These rules include stringent eligibility requirements, which were overhauled in 2004. There are also guidelines for conduct of a scholarship program.\n\nCollege chess does not fall under the authority of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Pan-Am is conducted under USCF rules and is rated both by USCF and FIDE.\n\nAt the 2012 Pan-Am, the CCC recommended that all cash prizes at the Pan-Am Intercollegiate be eliminated and forbidden.\n\nFor many years prior to 1996, high school teams were allowed to compete in the Pan-Am Intercollegiate, though few did.\n\nStarted in 1946, the Pan-Am has been held under various names and formats. For some years in the period 1945-1974 there was an individual college championship. Following Bobby Fischer's victory at the 1972 World Championship, the popularity of the Pan-Am temporarily soared. Beginning in the 1990s, the Pan-Am has been dominated by teams from schools offering chess scholarships.\n\nThe Quadrangular Intercollegiate league—comprising teams from Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia University and Princeton University—was formed in 1892, founded by Edward Caswell, Yale class of 1866. The tournament typically took place between Christmas and New Year's Day. Winners from 1892 to 1913 are as follows: Columbia 1892, 1893, 1899, 1902, 1906, 1907, 1910-1912; Harvard 1894-1898, 1903-1905; Yale 1901, 1913; Princeton 1908; tie between Harvard and Yale in 1909. In addition, Harvard and Yale played an annual team match.\n\nDuring the first decade of the twentieth century, future world champion Jose Raul Capablanca represented Columbia, on first board.\n\nThe Triangular Intercollegiate league—comprising teams from Cornell University, Brown University, and the University of Pennsylvania—was formed in 1899. Champions from 1899 to 1913 are as follows: Pennsylvania 1899, 1904, 1905, 1908, 1909, 1912, 1913; Cornell 1900-1903, 1907, 1910; tie between Pennsylvania and Brown in 1906; tie between Cornell and Pennsylvania in 1911.\n\nIn some years, all-star teams from the Quadrangular and Triangular leagues met in a challenge match.\n\nThe Pan-Am started in 1946.\n\nHowever, there had been a team event for American schools only before World War II. One noteworthy result from this earlier event, from 1931–32, had City College of New York winning, with Reuben Fine on board one and Sidney Norman Bernstein on board two; the team scored 31.5 out of a possible 32 points.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1964, the Pan-Am Intercollegiate Team Championship was held every even year, with a Pan-Am Intercollegiate Individual Championship held every odd year from 1945 to 1963.\n\nAmerican schools from the northeast and midwest regions dominated both the hosting and winning of the championship. Columbia University won three titles, the University of Chicago won two, and CCNY won two during this period. The first eight tournaments averaged about a dozen teams taking part. From 1962 to 1967, participation doubled to an average of about 25 teams per year.\n\nWith increased interest, annual team competition began in 1964. In 1965, 1967, and 1969, the tournament was an individual-and-team competition, that is, players entered as individuals, but if a school had four or more players entered, the four highest of its students' scores were added to make a team score. The 1965 event saw the first non-American winner, the University of Toronto. The first non-American school to host was Canada's McGill University at Montreal in 1969, and McGill also won the event that year. From 1968 to 1971, interest doubled again, to nearly 50 teams per year.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the level of participation in the Pan-Am grew about tenfold, as one of the effects of Bobby Fischer's chess career, culminating in the World Chess Championship. Attendance averaged nearly 108 teams per year from 1972 to 1978; the highest turnout was 123 teams (520 players) in 1975. Future Grandmasters Larry Christiansen and Ron Henley (both recruited with chess scholarships) anchored the 1976 championship team from New College of the University of South Florida Sarasota, the first southern school to win.\n\nThe University of Toronto was the first school to win three straight outright titles, from 1980 to 1982; this feat was repeated by Harvard University from 1988-90. Rhode Island College, led by former US High School Chess Champions James Thibault and Sandeep Joshi, rolled to a convincing victory in 1985. The winning 1983 team from Yale University featured 3 future US Chess Champions in Joel Benjamin, Michael Wilder, and Inna Izrailov.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1986, an average of 57 teams took part. Future US Chess Champion Grandmaster Patrick Wolff led Yale University to victory in 1987. Harvard University won four titles in five years from 1986 to 1990, either won outright or shared.\n\nPrior to 1986 the Pan Ams were organized by the Intercollegiate League of America (ICLA). The United States Chess Federation took over the organization after the 1986 Pan-Am in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nChicago 1991 saw a reigning U.S. champion appear in the Pan-Am for the first time, when 17-year-old Soviet émigré Gata Kamsky, was first board for Brooklyn College. Kamsky lost a sensational game to Vivek Rao of the winning University of Illinois team. Rao had previously led Harvard in winning the 1988, 1989 and 1990 Pan Ams.\n\nThe 1990s saw two important events that influenced college chess: the fall of the Iron Curtain sent a flood of very strong eastern European and former Soviet players to the Americas, and several schools began offering major chess scholarships.\n\nThe University of South Florida offered chess scholarships in 1976 to two young players, but abandoned the experiment after winning the 1976 Pan-Am. Subsequently, Rhode Island College offered chess scholarships, and eventually won the Pan-Am in 1985. The Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) recruited grandmasters and eventually offered chess scholarships. BMCC won the Pan-Am in 1993, 1994, and 1997. In contrast to those short-lived programs, the chess scholarship programs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) have taken root and continue to the present day.\n\nIn 2009, two more Texas schools fielded strong teams: University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) and Texas Tech University; both offered chess scholarships. The 2010 Final Four was the strongest to date: it featured UMBC (average USCF rating 2559), UTD (2574), UTB (2598), and Texas Tech (2429).\nIn 2012, Webster University and Lindenwood have emerged as contenders.\nThe 2012 Pan-Am was the strongest ever: the 44 teams included 23 grandmasters and five schools with average USCF ratings over 2500; Webster's A and B teams were initially ranked 1 and 3.\n\nAs of 2012, University of Maryland, Baltimore County and the University of Texas at Dallas share the record for most wins: each has won (or tied for first place) at the Pan-Am ten times.\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County also has the record for the longest winning streak: five-year 1998-2002,\nand the most wins at the Final Four: six times (2003–2006, 2009-2010).\n\n\n"}

The stadium was built in 2004 and has a maximum seating capacity of 8,500 people (7,000 fixed seats with additional grass berm seating for 1,500).\n\nThe ballpark is the spring training home of the Philadelphia Phillies, and also the home of their Class A affiliate, the Clearwater Threshers of the Florida State League. A sculpture titled \"The Ace\"—by artist Kevin Brady—stands at the ballpark's west entrance plaza.\n\nThe stadium was originally named after the regional / national cable company, Bright House Networks, whose local head end center is located just to the south of the stadium.\n\nIt was announced on January 20, 2004, that Bright House Networks had secured the naming rights for the new ballpark. Under the terms of the agreement, Bright House Networks would pay the Phillies $1.7 million over 10 years with an option for two 5-year renewals. The City of Clearwater receives one-third of the payment.\n\nIn 2017, the complex was renamed Spectrum Field after Bright House was purchased by Charter Communications. While named for Charter's residential service, the name invoked memories of the Spectrum arena that operated from 1967 to 2009 at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, which the Phillies have called home since 1971.\n\nSpectrum Field is the Phillies' third Clearwater spring-training home. The team moved to Clearwater in 1947. They trained and played home games at Clearwater Athletic Field from 1947 to 1954. The City of Clearwater opened a new ballpark for spring training in 1955 and named it Jack Russell Stadium. (The ballpark was renamed Jack Russell Memorial Stadium in 1990.) With the stadium aging, the Phillies and the city erected their new spring home adjacent to the Phillies' year-round training facility, the Carpenter Complex, four-miles east of Jack Russell Memorial Stadium.\n\nGround-breaking of the new stadium took place on October 16, 2002. The official ribbon-cutting ceremony for the ballpark took place on February 27, 2004 prior to the annual spring-training Phan Fest.\n\nOn June 24, 2012, thanks to the rain bands off Tropical Storm Debby, the field was flooded, becoming swimming pool-like.\n\nThe Phillies played their first spring-training game at the park on March 4, 2004. 8,205 fans watched the Phils beat the New York Yankees 5–1. Vicente Padilla started for the Phillies, Marlon Byrd had the park's first hit, and Jimmy Rollins hit the first home run.\n\nSpectrum Field hosted the 44th Florida State League All-Star Game on June 18, 2005. A crowd of 5,547 saw the West defeat the East 6–4. The Sarasota Reds' Chris Dickerson hit a two-run home run, scored two runs, and earned the game's Star of Stars Award. Future major league players who appeared in the game included Dickeron, Reggie Abercrombie, Carlos Villanueva, and Sean Marshall.\n\nThreshers pitcher Julio De La Cruz pitched the first no-hitter at the ballpark on August 18, 2006. De La Cruz beat the Sarasota Reds 5–0 in front of 5,906 fans on \"Pitch for Pink Night\" in Clearwater. The Threshers wore special pink uniforms to raise money for breast cancer research and awareness. It was the first no-hitter for Clearwater since 1992.\n\nThe Big East Conference held its championship tournament at Spectrum Field in 2006 and from 2008 to 2013. Notre Dame defeated Louisville 7–0 on May 27, 2006, to win the 2006 championship. Louisville defeated Cincinnati 6–3 to win the 2008 championship on May 24, 2008. In 2009, Louisville again won the tournament. In 2010, St. John's won the title, defeating UConn 3–0 in the championship game. In 2011, 5th-seeded Seton Hall became the lowest seeded team ever to win the Big East Tournament, defeating St. John's 4–2. In 2012, St. John's defeated South Florida 7–3 in the title game to win the tournament.

{"id": "27487639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27487639", "title": "Starting blocks", "text": "Starting blocks\n\nStarting blocks are a device used in the sport of track and field by sprint athletes to hold their feet at the start of a race so they do not slip as they push out at the sound of the gun. For most levels of competition, including the whole of high level international competition, starting blocks are mandatory equipment for the start of sprint races. \n\nThe invention of starting blocks is credited to Australian Charlie Booth and his father in 1929. \n\nPrior to their invention, runners would dig holes in the dirt track. Trowels were provided at the start of races. This was not the most consistent or stable system. It also was destructive to the track surface with the holes having to be filled for subsequent runners. When George Simpson became the first person to run 9.4 seconds for the 100-yard dash in 1930, his record was disallowed because he used starting blocks.\n\nWood was the first material used, with some tracks having permanently placed wooden starting blocks as built in structures at the start line. Portable blocks were held by long metal spikes that needed to be pounded into the ground. These devices evolved to metal blocks. The common blocks of the 1960s were heavy and adjusted by screws that were frequently broken or became rusted over the years. Lighter weight blocks were made of sheet metal. Nick Newton's innovative design uses cast aluminum.\n\nThe rubberized surfaces of new all-weather running tracks that became common starting in the 1970s, made the old blocks even less secure. Original Tartan tracks left long holes to secure the blocks but most tracks today require blocks to be held by small spikes similar to the ones used in shoes. Block slippage was common enough that it is an allowable loophole in the rules to recall the start of a race without calling a false start against an athlete whose blocks slip. In some amateur settings, such as high school track, since block slippage is much more common due to lower quality track surface material and/or starting blocks' spike quality, it is a commonly accepted practice to allow another person (usually a teammate) to sit on the ground behind the starting block and place their feet behind each block, using their leg power to further reduce the chance for the blocks to slip back upon the runner launching out of them.\n\nGenerally most races of 400 meters or shorter allow athletes to use starting blocks. Most runners in the 800 meters at the 1956 Olympics used starting blocks from a waterfall start.\n\nModern blocks used for world records now must have sensors that detect the pressure from the athlete and can be used to time their reaction to the starting gun. Athletes who react faster than 1/10th of a second can be charged with a false start and the race recalled. Many also carry electronic speakers so the sound of the gun arrives at the ears of the athletes at exactly the same time. Some races for hearing-impaired athletes have also used starting light systems, similar to motorsport's Christmas Tree.\n\n"}

The arena opened in September 2011 and is best known as the home arena for the ice hockey team Växjö Lakers. It seats 5,700 spectators.\n\nThe construction of Vida Arena began in September 2010 and was finished in summer 2011, in time for the Växjö Lakers' debut season in the Elitserien (now named the SHL), the top-tier ice hockey league in Sweden. Although mainly intended to be used for ice hockey, Vida Arena is also used for other events such as concerts and news conferences. The arena is named after the Vida Group, the company that acquired the naming rights for Vida Arena in September 2010, for the upcoming 14 seasons (expiring after the 2023–24 season).\n\nAs of the 2013–14 season, Vida Arena is the SHL's newest arena and has a spectator capacity of 5,700, making it the SHL's capacity-wise next-to-smallest arena, only surpassing Örebro's Behrn Arena.\n\nFor the entire 2011–12 season, the arena had a capacity of 5,329 spectators. Plans were announced to extend the capacity to at least 6,000. Prior to the beginning of the 2012–13 season, the capacity was increased to 5,800 spectators. In October 2012, however, the capacity was slightly reduced to 5,700 due to concerns from spectators. Level 4 was mainly affected.\n\nThe arena was officially inaugurated on 17 September 2011, in an ice hockey game between Växjö Lakers and Linköpings HC. The arena tickets for the game were outsold within just one hour, with the Lakers' marketing manager speculating that they could've sold out two arenas. Former Växjö Lakers crowd favorite Shjon Podein watched the game live in the arena. Linköping won the game 4–2 in front of 5,502 spectators. However, the Lakers' premier game on 13 September, on away ice against Frölunda HC, was shown on the Vida Arena's Jumbotron in front of 2,400 spectators, with free entrance, as a preview of the Vida Arena experience and a test of the arena's technical features. Frölunda won the game 2–0.\n\nVida Arena is part of the sports complex \"Arenastaden\" (\"Arena town\"), which also includes a new football stadium, a floorball arena, and an arena for athletics. Vida Arena is connected with Växjö Ishall, an old arena inaugurated in 1970 which, since a renovation which took place in 2006, has a capacity of 4,000 spectators.\n\nVida Arena hosted the first semifinal of Melodifestivalen 2012 on 4 February 2012. This was the third time that Växjö hosted a Melodifestivalen stage, after 2002 and 2005 (both times in Tipshallen).\n\nVida Arena is the first cashless arena in Sweden.\n\n"}

{"id": "6918116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6918116", "title": "Welding helmet", "text": "Welding helmet\n\nA welding helmet is a type of headgear used when performing certain types of welding to protect the eyes, face and neck from flash burn, ultraviolet light, sparks, infrared light, and heat. \n\nWelding helmets are most commonly used with arc welding processes such as shielded metal arc welding, gas tungsten arc welding, and gas metal arc welding. They are necessary to prevent arc eye, a painful condition where the cornea is inflamed. Welding helmets can also prevent retina burns, which can lead to a loss of vision. Both conditions are caused by unprotected exposure to the highly concentrated ultraviolet and infrared rays emitted by the welding arc. Ultraviolet emissions from the welding arc can also damage uncovered skin, causing a sunburn-like condition in a relatively short period of welding. In addition to the radiation, gasses or splashes can also be a hazard to the skin and the eyes.\n\nThe modern welding helmet used today was first introduced in 1937 by Willson Products.\n\nMost welding helmets include a window covered with a filter called a lens shade, through which the welder can see to work. In most helmets, the window may be made of tinted glass, tinted plastic, or a variable-density filter made from a pair of polarized lenses.\n\nAll welding helmets are susceptible to damages such as cracks that can compromise the protection from ultraviolet and infrared rays. In addition to protecting the eyes, the helmet protects the face from hot metal sparks generated by the arc and from UV damage. When overhead welding, a leather skull cap and shoulder cover are used to prevent head and shoulder burns.\n\nIn 1981, Swedish manufacturer Hornell International introduced an LCD electronic shutter that darkens automatically when sensors detect the bright welding arc, the Speedglas Auto-Darkening Filter. \n\nWith such electronic auto-darkening helmets, the welder no longer has to get ready to weld and then nod their head to lower the helmet over their face. The advantage is that the welder does not need to adjust the position of welding helmet manually which not only saves time but also reduces the risk of exposure to the harmful light generated by the welding process.\n\nIn January 2004, 3M acquired all assets of Hornell, including the Adflo and Speedglas auto darkening helmets brand name and patents. Speedglas helmets are now sold by 3M.\n\nIn the United States, the industry standard for welding helmets is ANSI Z87.1+ which specifies performance of a wide variety of eye protection devices. The standard requires that auto-darkening helmets provide full protection against both UV and IR even when they are not in the darkened state. The standard is voluntary, so buyers should confirm that the helmet is ANSI Z87.1 compliant (indicated by appropriate labeling).\n\n\n"}
