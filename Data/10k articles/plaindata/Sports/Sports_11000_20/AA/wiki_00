Ben Smith, of Virginia, was the men's winner. A Games competitor every year since 2009, this was his first win (he placed third in 2011 and 2013). Smith secured the win in a dramatic final event by holding off 2014's second-place finisher Mat Fraser who many had predicted would be the 2015 champion. Iceland's Katrin Davidsdottir, making her third Games appearance, was the women's winner, overtaking countrywoman Ragnheiður Sara Sigmundsdottir, who led for much of the competition, in the final event. CrossFit Mayhem Freedom from Cookeville, Tennessee, captained by four-time individual men's champion Rich Froning Jr., won the Affiliate Cup.\n\nApproximately 273,000 participants signed up for the 2015 CrossFit Games Open, which was held over the course of five weeks in February and March. The top 20 men, 20 women, and 15 teams from the 12 American and Canadian regions, the top 30 men, 30 women, and 20 teams in the European and Australian regions, and the top 10 men, 10 women, and 10 teams from Latin America, Africa, and Asia qualified for the CrossFit Regionals. After three-day Regional competitions held around the world, the field advancing to the CrossFit Games was narrowed to 40 men, 40 women, and 40 teams. New for the 2015 Regionals, the 17 regions were combined into 8 \"super-regions\".\n\nAs in previous years, the men's and women's competitions were similar, with the only differences being weights of lifted objects, heights of obstacles, etc. First-time elements in 2015 included open-ocean paddleboard racing and pegboard climbing.\n\nCrossFit also held a Masters competition where athletes aged 40 and above competed in their own age groups. Masters athletes qualified though the Open followed by an online Games qualification, called the Masters Qualifier, instead of Regionals. The top 20 Masters men and women in each age group were invited to participate at the Games.\n\nIn 2015, the CrossFit Games added a Teenage competition to the Open in two age groups (14-15 and 16-17) for boys and girls. Towards the end of the Open, it was announced that the top 10 in each age group after the completion of the Open would qualify to participate in the Games. The Teenage and Masters Games events were the same and took place from July 21–23.\n\n\nFor the fourth straight year, the CrossFit Games began on the Wednesday before the traditional weekend events. The Games have started with a swim every year since 2011, with this year's event consisted of 500 meters of ocean swimming, followed by two miles of paddling on a paddleboard, and finished with another 500 meters of ocean swimming.\n\nJonne Koski won the event for the men and Kara Webb won for the women.\n\nThe athletes moved weighted sandbags across the tennis stadium in the StubHub Center. They started by carrying/dragging the sandbags from the top of the stadium down to the floor, used a wheelbarrow to take them to the other side, and then pushed them over a wall and carried them to the top of the stadium. The men had to move 720 pounds and the women had 480 pounds total weight of sandbags. This event was nearly identical to an event held in 2010 except that the weight was increased and the wheelbarrows were specially made to handle the weight.\n\nLukas Högberg and Anna Tunnicliffe won the event men's and women's events, respectively.\n\nWhile wearing a weighted vest:\n\nCrossFit's most famous hero workout, named for fallen sailor US Navy SEAL Lt.

The box weight was 560 pounds for the men and 395 for the women, and the length was over 6 feet, making the flips more difficult than shorter objects that many athletes had trained with. The first two legless rope climbs were done on a 2-inch diameter rope and the last two on a 1.5-inch diameter rope. The handstand walks had to be completed in 50-foot unbroken increments.\n\nBen Smith won the event for the men and Elisabeth Akinwale won for the women.\n\n\nEach athlete gets two 20-second windows in which to attempt their heaviest clean and jerk for one repetition.\n\nAaron Hanna won the event with a 350-pound lift for the men and Brooke Ence won with a 242-pound lift for the women.\n\n15–10–6 repetitions of:\n\nNamed \"Triangle Couplet\" because the repetitions per round are all triangular numbers.

The 24 calories were rowed on a Concept-2 rowing machine. The 16 calories were pedaled on an Assault AirBike. The dumbbell squat snatches are performed with a 100-pound/70-pound dumbbell for the men/women respectively and done with alternating arms.\n\nSpencer Hendel won for the men and Margaux Alvarez for the women.\n\n\nThis event took place two minutes after Event 12. The handstand push-ups were performed against a wall. The row and bike were identical to the previous event. The deadlifts were performed with a 203-pound/124-pound (men/women) kettlebell in each hand, and after every two lifts, the weights were carried forward.\n\nSpencer Hendel won again for the men and Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir won for the women.\n\n"}

{"id": "10092915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10092915", "title": "Addington Hills", "text": "Addington Hills\n\nAddington Hills is a park in Upper Shirley, London, England. It is managed by the London Borough of Croydon. It was part of the old parish of Addington before the suburb of Shirley was developed in the 1930s. The site consists largely of woodland on a gravel bed, with London's largest area of heathland at its heart. It is a Site of Metropolitan Importance. In the mid-18th century, it was a noted cricket venue used by the then-prominent Addington Cricket Club.\n\nIt is a peaceful area with many pathways close to central Croydon. There is a viewpoint with fine views across Croydon and across to north London, including Docklands and Parliament Hill. It is served by Coombe Lane tram stop on Tramlink. The park covers an area of . The London Loop path runs through the park. The park is fully accessible at all times.\n\nAddington Hills and neighbouring Croham Hurst form popular open spaces in Croydon. The seasonal changes of the colourful heather, birch, oak and pine and the variety of birds and other wildlife and the bracing situation on top of the plateau attract visitors to the area at all times of the year.\n\nThe first definite mention of Addington Hills in a cricket connection is a 1745 match there on Thursday, 23 May between Addington and London. Little about the match is known except that Addington won. The venue was used for first-class matches on at least four occasions between 1745 and 1752, a period which coincided with Addington Cricket Club having one of the strongest teams in England during the careers of Tom Faulkner, Joe Harris, John Harris, George Jackson and Durling. The last one known to have been played there was Addington v Dartford on 12 August 1752.\n\nAddington Hills facilities include:\n\nAddington Hills reaches 460 feet (140 m) above sea level on a plateau of Blackheath Bed pebbles, which has been colonized by heather with scattered groups of pines and mixed plantations. The plateau drops sharply to the north, exposing the pebbles at the end of the gullies. To the north-west the plateau has been broken into by a number of steep valleys which are covered with birch to the west and oak to the east. Below the Blackheath pebbles an outcrop of less impervious Woolwich Beds was marked by a line of springs; these have disappeared, possibly due to a lowering of the water table. Addington Hills borders Coombe Park on its north, and Coombe Wood on its south.\n\nThe area was originally called \"the hill of Pripledeane\" or \"Prible Dean\", a name meaning \"Gravel Valley\" that came from the Middle English words \"prebel\" (\"gravel\") and \"dene\" (\"valley\"). The land was acquired in four parts over a 45-year period. In 1874 the Croydon Board of Health purchased the first area following a public meeting; the lower area towards Shirley was added in 1903; the birch wood from Oaks Road to Coombe Lane was a gift from Frank Lloyd of Coombe Park Estate (after whom the nearby Lloyd Park was named), and finally the small pine woods in the south-east corner were added in 1919 bringing the site to its current size and forming the largest public open space in Croydon at the time.\n\nIn 1963 a viewing platform was provided by Alderman Basil Monk as a permanent commemoration of Croydon's 1960 Millennary Year. The platform, which is north-west of the restaurant, is at the top of steeply sloping ground and provides extensive views over Croydon and towards London. A low wall around the platform is engraved with directional lines and inscriptions indicating the main view points, such as Shooters Hill, Epping Forest, Fulham, the Town Hall and skyscrapers of Croydon, and on a clear day the towers of Windsor Castle. Sadly, in recent years, the metal direction plaques have been removed from the balustrade wall by thieves (it’s a shame that the information wasn’t cut by the stonemason directly into the coping stones). The nearby Shirley Windmill can also be seen.\n\nAddington Reservoir on the southern side of the Hills is the only area that is fenced off and not open to the public. The reservoir was built in 1888 and the Valve House was initially open to the public with refreshments being served from the ground floor and a residence above. An outbreak of typhoid in 1937 was traced to the reservoir and the cafe was quickly closed and the area fenced off.\n\nBelow the reservoir on the Coombe Road frontage was once Broadcombe Cottage, which was part of the Coombe Park Estate. Broadcombe was the old name for the tract of land alongside Oaks Road at the foot of Addington Hills. Also in this vicinity was the Lamb Inn, according to tradition the site of a fierce affray between smugglers and revenue officers.\n\nThe heathland areas are dominated by heather and gorse, with some bilberry and goldenrod. Drier spots are indicated by the occurrence of bell heather. Fine-leaved fescues, wavy hair-grass and purple moor-grass dominate the acid grassland areas with a mix of wood sage, heath bedstraw and other typical species. Marsh violet and hard fern (both London rarities) occur in the damper areas.\n\nBurrowing bees and wasps occur in the bare patches of soil and the bushy heathers and acid-loving grasses provide home to a wide range of insects, spiders and other invertebrates, each well adapted to the warm, dry conditions at ground level.\n\nThe invertebrate fauna plays an important part in supporting a range of birds and reptiles – and all benefit from the varied mosaic of open and scrubland habitats. In open areas, common lizards and slowworms thrive. Green woodpeckers may be seen in the woods and on the heath, and goldcrests among the woodland edges and in the gorse.\n\nThe northern area of woodland is by far the oldest, in particular the very old oak pollards near Oaks Road. Other wooded areas are comparatively recent, and the small pine plantations near the southern boundary were only established during the mid-19th century.\n\nUntil the 1920s, there were only a few scattered oak, pine and birch on the hills, which were then almost entirely covered in heather. Now there is far more extensive tree cover, and heather is limited to the slopes and ridges where it tolerates the harsh conditions provided by the very dry and acidic poor soil.\n\n\n"}

It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of the Old Dominion Monarchs baseball team. The Monarchs are members of Conference USA. The ballpark has seating for 2,500 spectators in three sections of raised aluminum bleachers. The stadium complex also includes locker rooms, a concession stand, offices, four batting cages, a picnic area and a fully enclosed press box. The facility replaced the university's football stadium, Foreman Field, as the home of the baseball team.\n\nThe ballpark is named after former Old Dominion head basketball coach, baseball manager, and athletic director Bud Metheny, who worked for the university from 1948 to 1980 after an eleven-year stint in the New York Yankees organization including a World Series championship in 1943. He compiled a record of 423 wins, 363 losses and 6 ties as manager of the Monarchs. Metheny's jersey number, 3, has been retired by the university and is displayed on the right field wall of the stadium.\n\nThe stadium opened for the 1983 baseball season, with the first game being a 7–2 Old Dominion win over Millersville University. The complex was not dedicated until April 25, 1984 with a game against the Virginia Tech Hokies. That night's crowd of 2,125 is the highest attendance in stadium history. The ballpark hosted the Sun Belt Conference Baseball Tournament in 1983, 1985, and 1987, and the Colonial Athletic Association Baseball Tournament in 1994. Old Dominion defended home field and won the 1985 Sun Belt and 1994 Colonial championships. The stadium has also hosted multiple Virginia district and state high school baseball tournaments. The Monarchs tied the NCAA record for double plays completed in a single game on May 14, 1985, with 7 during a home game against the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers.

The poles are generally between in height and approximately in diameter. Some poles have a slightly larger pole that rotates around the static central pole using ball bearings. This rotating pole allows a performer to spin on the vertical axis, giving a performer the ability to incorporate rate of spin into what would otherwise be static moves. Bringing the body closer into the pole causes the performer to spin faster. A few Chinese pole tricks have been incorporated with pole dancing techniques.\n\nThe poles are sometimes covered with rubber to improve grip. However, the rubber can cause friction burns on parts of the Chinese pole artists' bodies. Acrobats often wear multiple layers of clothing to prevent such burns and bruises.\n\nThe most famous trick is \"the flag\" where the artist hangs straight out from the pole with his or her hands. This requires a very strong upper body. A few people are able to do push ups in this position, and even fewer can rotate the legs around in a circle—this requires enormous core strength.\n"}
{"id": "5580930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5580930", "title": "Colchester Community Stadium", "text": "Colchester Community Stadium\n\nColchester Community Stadium, known for sponsorship reasons as the JobServe Community Stadium, is a football stadium in Colchester, England. It is the home of Colchester United Football Club. It has a capacity of 10,105 and opened in August 2008 in time for the 2008–09 season.\n\nA stadium working party was first set up by Colchester Borough Council in 1976 in order to assess the feasibility and possible location for a new stadium for Colchester United. After 30 years of discussions and various site suggestions, a location in the north of Colchester called Cuckoo Farm on land owned by Colchester Borough Council was settled on. Detailed planning permission was fully granted in June 2007 on the stadium which would cost £14 million, replacing the club's Layer Road ground, which had been their home since Colchester United's foundation in 1937. Work began in July 2007 and construction was completed in August 2008 ahead of Colchester United's first match at the stadium.\n\nAfter ten years of sponsorship, it was announced that the naming rights would switch from Weston Homes to JobServe in another ten year deal. The stadium would now be known as the JobServe Community Stadium.\n\nColchester United's previous ground, Layer Road, was built in 1910, homing United's predecessors Colchester Town. Town were an amateur club and were wound down in 1937 to begin a professional club for Colchester that would be known Colchester United, as the new club moved into Town's Layer Road ground. With an ageing stadium, throughout the 1970s to the mid-2000s, Colchester United and Colchester Borough Council had been looking to re-home the club. Attention was first brought to the idea of relocation during the 1970s, when club chairman Maurice Cadman announced that Layer Road required £280,000 of basic improvements to meet the required safety legislation of the time. When the ground was purchased from the Council in 1971, a covenant was placed on Layer Road that the site could not be sold to be developed as housing. Potential resolutions for the problem included moving the pitch and building a new main stand, but proved to be too expensive for the club's ailing finances. The plans would have created an 'adequately' sized stadium with an 18,000 capacity, though the season ended with an average of just 3,818 in attendance.\n\nIn 1976, Colchester Borough Council set up a stadium working party to work towards solutions, locations and study the feasibility for a new stadium for the town. During the 1980–81 season, plans were submitted for an all-seater stadium at the Avenue of Remembrance, Colchester. However, the club ended the season 22nd out of 24 in the Third Division table and relegated to the Fourth Division, with an average gate of just 2,641 and a new all-time lowest attendance of 1,430. The stadium plan was rejected by the council on the grounds of the covenant restrictions.\n\nIn the wake of the Bradford City stadium fire on 11 May 1985 which left 56 people dead, owing to the stadium's antiquated wooden structure, it became of utmost importance to accelerate Colchester United's move from the timber-constructed Layer Road stands to a new stadium. Just 18 days later, the Heysel Stadium disaster occurred, leading to 39 deaths and hundreds of injuries. Layer Road faced £500,000 of safety improvements, but with no money, the club closed sections of the ground which reduced capacity to 4,900. A new location for a replacement stadium was mooted at Turner Rise, Colchester, as new owner and chairman Jonathan Crisp introduced developers Norcross Estates as shirt sponsors for the 1987–88 season. Crisp considered selling Layer Road and ground-sharing Portman Road with neighbours and rivals Ipswich Town whilst the Turner Rise stadium was constructed. However, the plans were delayed and eventually scrapped, with Crisp's plan to ground-share swayed by a group of Colchester United's former directors. A later plan to build a stadium at Wick Lane, Ardleigh saw plans thrown out as Colchester were relegated from the Football League for the first time in 40 years.\n\nLayer Road was sold back to the Council for £1.2 million in the early 1990s in order to clear Colchester United's debts, with the club leasing the stadium for three years. Following this, the Football League required all clubs to have a minimum lease of ten years on all stadia, to which the Council extended the arrangement. Meanwhile, the Borough Council also determined ten potential sites for a new stadium to be contracted, with each examined. With the lease on Layer Road due to expire in 2002, Kirklees McAlpine were commissioned as consultants for a new stadium in 1998. A preferred site at Cuckoo Farm was identified, with additional benefit being that the land was already owned by the Council.\n\nWith a site now chosen, plans were submitted in April 1999 which would include an earmarked 30-acre site, ten acres of which would accommodate car parking and a park and ride system, and a further ten for commercial use, including hotels and leisure facilities. The application was submitted simultaneously with plans for a new major junction (junction 28) on the A12. Outline planning consent was approved in July 2003, including approval for 1,500 homes, a police station and a primary school.\n\nWith the \"Community Stadium Now!\" petition set up by Colchester's Evening Gazette newspaper and with 13,000 signatures in support, the Cuckoo Farm plans were submitted to Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott for a decision to be made on the application. Prescott gave his approval for the regeneration project for the north of Colchester in January 2005, meaning construction work could begin as early as 2006 after planning application had been submitted in autumn 2005.\n\nOn 13 November 2006, Colchester United chief executive Marie Partner announced to United fans gathered at Colchester's Moot Hall that the stadium had received the go-ahead after clearing a major hurdle. The Council had backed the £14.23 million stadium by taking out a £10.23 million loan. At this point, the petition had also gathered over 30,000 signatures. The remaining £4 million came in the form of grants from the Football Foundation and local government and development agencies. More good news followed with the announcement by Colchester Councillors that work could begin on the stadium prior to the opening of a new access route linked to the A12 in January 2007. Scottish firm Barr Construction were then announced as contractors for the new stadium just two weeks later.\n\nWork began on the Cuckoo Farm site in June 2007, with temporary buildings and construction vehicles arriving on site from 4 June. Building work finally began in July 2007 with the intention of completion in time for the beginning of the 2008–09 season. With building work nearing completion, Colchester announced the name for the stadium would officially be the \"Colchester Community Stadium\", but owing to a deal with building firm Weston Homes, the ground would be known as the \"Weston Homes Community Stadium\". The ten-year sponsorship deal would be worth up to £2 million and would also include shirt sponsorship for the 2008–09 season.\n\nThe first fixture to be played at the Community Stadium was a friendly between Colchester United and Spanish club Athletic Bilbao, on 4 August 2008. The first goal to be scored at the stadium was from Aritz Aduriz for Bilbao after 15 minutes, but Colchester forward Scott Vernon equalised from the penalty spot on 32 minutes, registering the first Colchester goal at the Community Stadium. The game finished 2–1 to the Spanish club.\n\nThe first competitive fixture at the Community Stadium came on 16 August 2008 when Colchester hosted Huddersfield Town in front of a crowd of 5,340. Mark Yeates scored the first competitive goal at the stadium in a 2–2 draw with Oldham Athletic on 30 August 2008 but the U's had to wait until 25 October 2008 to register their first win at the ground. They won emphatically against Carlisle United, scoring five with goals from David Perkins, Dean Hammond, Akanni-Sunday Wasiu and two netted by Mark Yeates.\n\nWith a seating capacity of 10,105, the stadium is divided into four stands, with each stand incorporating disabled access. The West Stand is the largest stand which contains both conventional seating for supporters, but also houses 24 executive boxes and corporate areas. These areas can hold up to 400 diners in the Layer and Centennial suites. Directors boxes are situated either side of the tunnel entrance with dugouts and press areas also separated by the tunnel. A television gantry is placed on the roof of the stand above the executive boxes. Housed in the West Stand are the club's administration offices, club shop, ticket office and reception.\n\nThe North Stand is designated for away supporters for Football League fixtures.\n\nThe East Stand is home to the family enclosure which offer family-friendly pricing for supporters choosing to be situated there.\n\nThe South stand houses Colchester United's vocal supporters, where up to 2,000 fans can sit. This stand also uses pricing incentives to encourage supporters to create a loud and vocal atmosphere.\n\nUtilising the space of the Layer and Centennial suites, the stadium also plays host to a range of other activities, including conferences, banqueting, weddings, parties and events. The stadium features a 600 space car park and hosts boxing dinners, darts opens, comedy nights, tribute band nights, fashion shows, award ceremonies and proms.\n\nThe stadium was used as an open-air music venue for the first time on 29 June 2014 when Sir Elton John played his first ever Colchester concert. The event had a capacity of around 16,500. Lionel Richie performed in an open air setting in June 2016 as part of his \"All The Hits\" tour. An audience of 17,000 watched local singer Olly Murs perform on 10 June 2017 in the stadiums third open-air concert.\n\nThe Community Stadium has hosted four international football matches; three featuring the England under-21s and one England under-19 game. The first international game at the stadium saw England under-19s defeat their German counterparts 1–0 in front of a crowd of 9,692 on 18 November 2008 courtesy of a Henri Lansbury goal. The next international fixture saw England under-21s qualify for the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship as they beat Lithuania 3–0 with two goals from Danny Welbeck and one from Marc Albrighton. A crowd of 7,240 watched the game on 7 September 2010. The England under-21s returned to Colchester for a 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifier on 11 November 2011. The Young Lions cruised to a 5–0 victory against Iceland on the night, with goals from Marvin Sordell, Martin Kelly, Craig Dawson and two scored by Gary Gardner. The attendance for the game was 10,051. England won their fourth match after almost five years away from the Community Stadium on 6 September 2016. Full England international Marcus Rashford made his England under-21 debut in the game, scoring a hat-trick as England scored six times against Norway. The other scorers were Nathaniel Chalobah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Lewis Baker. England's opposition scored for the first time at the Community Stadium when Ghayas Zahid scored Norway's consolation with the score at 4–1.\n\nThe stadium hosted the England women's team for the first time in a competitive fixture for their 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification game against Kazakhstan on 28 November 2017. The Lionesses won 5–0 on the night with goals from Melissa Lawley, Fran Kirby, two from Nikita Parris, and Izzy Christiansen. The England women's team had previously played at the stadium in a 2-0 loss against Iceland women's team on 16th July 2009\n\nThe highest attendance at the Community Stadium is 10,064 when Colchester United hosted Norwich City on 16 January 2010. Canaries manager Paul Lambert had been in charge at Colchester when the U's defeated Norwich 7–1 on the opening day of the season at Carrow Road. Shortly after this event, Lambert defected to Norwich, and with bad feelings between the clubs spelt a fiery affair for the return fixture. Substitute Ian Henderson was sent off on his home debut for Colchester as they were handed a heavy 5–0 defeat by Norwich.\n\nThe Colchester Community Stadium is situated close to junction 28 on the A12. The stadium can hold just under 700 cars in the main car park, and there are two drop off zones situated around the stadium. A park and ride situated on the opposite side of the A12 opened in 2015, in which supporters are able to park on match days.\n\nIn May 2009, the Colchester Community Stadium was named overall winner in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors East of England Awards. The RICS said the stadium project had been a \"fantastic new facility for Colchester United Football Club\" but that it also gave \"benefits to the wider community\". The stadium also won the community benefit award.\n\n"}

The script was written by Wan Fang.\n\nAt the time of filming, Tao Hong was a third-year student at the Central Academy of Drama, acting in her second film role. She was chosen for the lead role mainly because of her athletic background, as she had been a professional synchronised swimmer for 10 years. To prepare for the film, Tao also spent time among disabled people. Her performance in this film won her some of the highest honors in China, as well as awards in Syria and France.\n\nA number of real-life Chinese Paralympians appeared in small roles, such as Wang Juan.\n\nIf not for attending a school for the blind, Ding Lihua (Tao Hong) is just like any other young, silly girl. The chirping of canary or the touch of snow will bring out a big smile from her. She hates it, however, when people mention her disability especially out of sympathy, and when her brother (Zhang Wankun) and sister-in-law (Ding Jiali) try to matchmake her with an older blind musician, she takes offense. One day, running after her brother's bicycle on the rural road, Ding is spotted by Li Mingsheng (Jiang Kai), a dedicated Paralympic coach who trains a group of disabled track athletes. Ding joins his team, though she quits not long after due to a disagreement with his harsh training method.\n\nRealizing that running under Li is her best bet to become something, she returns to the team, and Li quickly sees the potential and the competitive spirit in her. They train hard and Ding wins the 100-metre dash in her first official competition. Ding develops feelings for Li, even though she is also aware that he is fully healthy with a beautiful girlfriend Yu Su (Cui Qianmei). Around this time, Liu Yi (He Bing), a rich ex-classmate, visits her frequently with the intention of dating her. Though not interested in him, Ding borrows money from Liu to try to help Li mend his failing relationship with Yu, but Li and Yu still break up for good. Li thanks Ding, but rejects her love. Ding becomes sullen, and leaves the team again after an argument with Li. Li gains more understanding of blind people that they wish to be treated normally more than they need sympathy, while Ding also realizes that she needs to accept the reality that she is blind and different from others.\n\nAfter winning a gold medal at a Paralympic Games for China, Ding returns home and becomes a masseuse. It is through sports that she becomes a confident human being, and she begins to see colors in her dreams.\n\n"}

When referring to the Prince of Wales' (the future Edward VII) score of nought on 17 July 1866, a contemporary newspaper wrote that the Prince \"retired to the royal pavilion on a 'duck's egg' \". The name is believed to come from the shape of the number \"0\" being similar to that of a duck's egg, as in the case of the American slang term \"goose-egg\" popular in baseball and the tennis term \"love,\" derived - according to one theory - from French \"l'oeuf\" (\"the egg\"). The Concise Oxford Dictionary still cites \"duck's egg\" as an alternative version of the term.\n\nThe first duck in a Test match was made in the very first Test, between Australia and England at Melbourne in March 1877, when Ned Gregory was caught by Andrew Greenwood off the bowling of James Lillywhite.\nAs of 2017, the record for the most ducks in Test cricket is held by West Indies player Courtney Walsh, who was out for nought on 43 occasions,\nwhile the overall first-class record is 156, set by Worcestershire and England player Reg Perks.\n\nOne particularly high-profile example of a duck came in 1948, when Don Bradman was playing his final Test match for Australia, against England at The Oval. In Australia's first innings, Bradman was bowled for a duck by Eric Hollies, causing his Test average to fall from 101.39 to 99.94; had he scored just four runs, his average would have been 100. As things turned out, Australia won the match by an innings, and so Bradman did not get to bat a second time (had he batted, he would have needed at least 104 runs if dismissed or at least four runs if not out to get his average back to 100).\n\nIn the first Test of Australia's tour of India in 1986, with the cumulative scores tied, Indian tailender Maninder Singh was trapped LBW by Greg Matthews for a four ball duck, ensuring just the second tied Test in Test Cricket history.\n\nIndian all-rounder Ajit Agarkar earned the unfortunate nickname \"Bombay Duck\" after being dismissed for ducks five consecutive times in test matches against Australia.\n\nIn a 1913 match against Glastonbury, Huish and Langport's batsmen all scored ducks for a total of zero runs. A similar occurrence in indoor cricket happened in 2016, when Bapchild Cricket Club were dismissed for zero against Christ Church University.\n\nOn January 30, 2017 tailender Josh Hazlewood (Aus) became the first player to be dismissed for a \"diamond duck\" in a partnership of more than fifty runs. He was run out at the non-striker's end without facing a delivery.\n\nThere are several variations used to describe specific types of duck. The usage or prevalence of many of these terms vary regionally, with one term having different meanings in different parts of the world. Even within commentary from ESPN Cricinfo or individual cricket board websites, there is no uniform application of some of these terms.\n\nTo be dismissed for nought in both innings of the same two-innings match is to be dismissed for a pair,\nbecause the two noughts together are thought to resemble a pair of spectacles; the longer form is occasionally used. To be dismissed first ball in \"both\" innings (\"i.e.\", two golden ducks) is to suffer the indignity of making a \"king pair\".\n\nMost duck by a batsmen in his career \n\n"}

{"id": "50005952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50005952", "title": "Football in Africa", "text": "Football in Africa\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Africa. Indeed, football is probably the most popular sport in every African country, although rugby and cricket are also very popular in South Africa.\n\nFootball was first introduced to Africa in the late 19th century by Europeans. The game was first played in the continent in 1862; historian Peter Alegi said that it \"spread very quickly through the mission schools, through the military forces and through the railways.\" Teams were being established in South Africa before 1900, Egypt and in Algeria during a similar time period. Savages FC (Pietermaritzburg, South Africa), and Gezira SC are the oldest African football clubs that remain in existence. Both began play in 1882 followed by Alexandria SC (1890) and CAL Oran from Algeria in 1897. By the 1930s, football was being played in Central Africa.\n\nAs Africa is a highly superstitious continent many African teams depend on witch doctors for success. Activities that witch doctors have performed for teams include cutting players, placing potions on equipment, and sacrificing animals.\n\nChildren are also often exploited by agents. Other issues faced in African football include a lack of organisation by national team officials, and internal disputes between players and federation officials.\n\nThe Confederation of African Football (CAF) was founded in 1957, Sudan was the founder of African football by creating CAF with four member nations: Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Sudan. The first Africa Cup of Nations was held the same year, with a three-team field. Egypt won the inaugural African Cup of Nations, defeating Ethiopia 4–0 in the final. As the sport grew football associations grew across the continent. Qualification rounds were added for the 1962 event. African national teams compete in the Africa Cup of Nations and also in the African Nations Championship for local teams.\n\nThe first African nation to participate in the FIFA World Cup was Egypt in 1934. That remained the only World Cup appearance by a team from the continent until 1966, when a team from CAF was originally scheduled to compete in a playoff with teams from Asia and Oceania for one tournament berth. In response, CAF nations boycotted World Cup qualifying, and FIFA granted CAF one guaranteed berth in the 1970 tournament. Starting in 1970, African nations at the FIFA World Cup started to compete regularly. Zaire was Africa's representative at the 1974 edition of the competition. The team lost all three of its games. In 1977, Pelé stated his belief that a team from the continent would be crowned World Cup champions by the end of the 20th century, which proved incorrect.\n\nAfter the 1970, 1974, and 1978 World Cups, which each had one African qualifier, there were two teams from the continent in 1982: Algeria and Cameroon, each of which missed out on advancing from the group stage on goal difference. The 1986 and 1990 World Cups also featured two African nations; Morocco reached the round of 16 in 1986 after finishing first in their group. Cameroon advanced to the quarterfinals of the 1990 World Cup, becoming the first African national team to do so. Senegal and Ghana matched the feat, in 2002 and 2010 respectively. By 2010 South Africa become the first African nation to host the World Cup.\n\nNumerous Nigerian cities hosted women's football teams by 1960. Multiple efforts were made in the 1960s to start women's football clubs in South Africa, but they proved fleeting. The 1970s saw some growth, with new women's leagues in Nigeria and an expansion of women's football into Western African countries, including Senegal. One local club in Dakar played a match against an Italian club in 1974; five years later, an early match between African nations was played by the Dakar side and a team from Guinea.\n\nDespite a lack of support from Nigerian officials, 28 clubs played women's football in the country by 1989, and Nigeria's national team competed in the 1991 Women's World Cup. More women began playing football in the 1990s, in countries like Nigeria and South Africa. In 1998, CAF introduced an official African Women's Championship, following two unofficial versions of the tournament earlier in the 1990s; host country Nigeria won, beginning a stretch of five consecutive titles in the event. The next year, the squad reached the quarterfinals of the 1999 Women's World Cup.\n\nFootball is played in a limited capacity by women due to a lack of funding. The masculine nature of football has proved a deterrent to women's involvement in football in Africa. \n"}

The term is often used in the context of team sports such as football or rugby.\n\nIn the strictest definition, one-club men are rare in football due to the effects of the large pay offers from rival clubs and promotion and relegation systems used by most professional leagues. Promotion creates the tendency for (mostly younger) players to be lent out to gain first-team experience, while relegation causes players to move for financial reasons (most often the case if the club is relegated or in debt) and for (mostly older) players to play at a lower level in order to prolong their careers.\n\nIn addition to those who spent their entire playing career with a single club, there are several examples of players remaining with a single club throughout their entire career within the professional club game — playing, coaching, management, etc. Notable examples are listed below.\n\n\nIn 2015, the Spanish club Athletic Bilbao (who place particular importance on player loyalty and promotion from within), introduced an annual 'One club man award' to be presented to one retired player (excluding their own) who represented those values during their career.\n\nRecipients, who attend a match as a guest of the club and receive the trophy on the pitch, have included:\n\n"}

The spines are one of five colours, each of the five representing a quality the Games are said to endorse: youth, passion, collaboration, determination, and creativity. \n\nPorcupines have relatively poor vision, so the choice of basing Pachi's design on a porcupine is said to be a symbolic bond with the athletes of the Parapan Games.\n\nThe Games licensed \"Inner Ninja\" as Pachi's theme song.\n\nSeventeen performers were hired to don a Pachi suit, and play Pachi.\n\nAfter the Pan Am and Parapan Am Games, Pachi became the mascot for the Ontario Games.

{"id": "682602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=682602", "title": "Riding boot", "text": "Riding boot\n\nA riding boot is a boot made to be used for horse riding. The classic boot comes high enough up the leg to prevent the leathers of the saddle from pinching the leg of the rider, has a sturdy toe to protect the rider's foot when on the ground and has a distinct heel to prevent the foot from sliding through the stirrup. The sole is smooth or lightly textured to avoid being caught on the tread of the stirrup in the event of a fall.\n\nThe modern riding boot is relatively low-heeled, with a heel of less than one inch, though historically a higher heel was common, as it has always been critically important for riding boots to prevent the foot from slipping through the stirrup. Today, only some styles of cowboy boot retain a higher heel than other modern riding boots.\n\nFor the riding disciplines that fall into the category of English riding, there are a number of different styles of riding boots, intended for different styles of riding, from horse shows, to pleasure riding. Tall boots, which end just below the knee of the rider, include field, dress, and hunt boots. These are standard show apparel, worn by all competitors in the hunter/jumper and dressage disciplines. A lower, paddock boot that stops just above the ankle, is worn by children, by some show competitors in the UK, Australia, and by those that show Saddle seat...\n\nField boots: so called because they were traditionally worn by officers ranked \"field grade\" or higher, have lacing at the vamp, which allows for some give so the rider is more comfortable riding with the highly flexed ankle that develops from the shorter stirrup length required for work over fences. Therefore, field boots are preferred in all jumping disciplines, including Hunt seat equitation, show jumping, fox hunting, and both jumping phases in eventing. They are also worn by police officers riding motorcycles or on mounted patrols, and by some police agencies as part of their \"Class A\" uniform or with ceremonial mounted units. The majority of field boots are black, although brown-colored boots may also be purchased.\n\nDress boots: do not have lacing at the ankle, and are generally stiffer. They are worn by dressage riders, eventers in the dressage phase, and at formal fox hunts. They are also worn by riders of show jumpers. Dress boots are traditionally black in color. A recent fad is dress boots for dressage that are cut to go extra high on the outside of the knee.\n\nHunt boots, or Top boots: like the dress boot, except it has a \"cuff\" at the top. The boot is usually black, with a tan cuff (traditional for male riders). It is appropriate for fox hunting.\n\nPaddock boots, also known as Jodhpur boots, are short boots that come just above the ankle, used most often for pleasure riding and everyday use. They are also required for Saddle seat style riding and are frequently worn by children when showing in hunt seat disciplines because they are less costly for rapidly growing children than are tall boots. They are sometimes combined with half chaps, a type of gaiter also known as chapettes, for added protection or to give the visual impression of a tall boot. The lace-up style is primarily seen in hunt seat riding, whereas the elastic-sided Chelsea boot design is seen in both hunt seat and saddle seat disciplines. The elastic side boot is also commonly used in Australia as a riding boot and dress boot. They are part of the required attire in Australian Stock Horse turnout competitions and for Pony Club riding. Heavier versions, such as Blundstone boots, are made for general work and gardening but are not suitable for riding owing to their heavy, deep-grooved soles.\n\nField boots (and many paddock boots) have an extra layer of leather on the toe, called a toe cap. All styles have somewhat tapered, round toes. Current styles include zip-on boots, with a zipper running down the back of the calf of a tall boot or the front of a paddock boot, making them easier to put on and remove without aid of boot hooks or a boot jack.\n\nBrown tall boots (field or dress) were somewhat more common before World War II, when the English riding habit lost popularity outside of formal and/or horse show events. The U.S. Army, whose officers had worn high brown boots in World War I, abandoned the practice by the late 1930s. For a time, some show sanctioning organizations did not allow brown boots, considering them to be casual attire, although the rule has been relaxed somewhat.\n\nFor western riding and showing, western riders wear cowboy boots, with either the high \"cowboy\" or \"riding\" heel; the intermediate, somewhat lower \"walking\" heel; or the low, \"roper\" style heel that is similar to that of English boots. The uppers may vary in height. The lowest is the \"roper\" style that stops just a bit above the ankle, about an inch or so higher than the English paddock boot. The most classic length is the mid-calf height that keeps the fenders of a western saddle from chafing the ankle and calf of the rider. The tallest cowboy boots are seldom seen outside of fashion venues, but have an upper that reaches nearly to the knee, are usually extensively decorated, but in the modern day are seldom used for actual horse riding. For pleasure riding, lace-up or zip-up boots similar to English paddock boots, have become popular in recent years, though the classic pull-on boot still is common. Cowboy boots are traditionally made of smooth cowhide, though occasionally a boot style may be of a suede or \"roughout\" look. However, the uppers of more expensive designs may be made of leather obtained from somewhat exotic creatures, including alligator, ostrich and snakeskin.\n\nTraditionally, English riding boots are made of smooth leather, usually cowhide, or occasionally pigskin, and most show boots remain thus due to the classic look. However, synthetic leather, vinyl and other materials are becoming more common. Quality of leather varies, with softer, finer-quality increasing the value of the boot. For formal wear, patent leather is occasionally seen, particularly in jodhpur boots designed for saddle seat horse show classes held after 6:00 pm, when formal attire may be worn in certain types of competition.\n\nFor casual riding, riders often wear well-worn show boots, but also may take advantage of new boot designs modeled after the athletic shoe or hiking boot that have been created, using space age synthetics and breathable materials to create what essentially is a \"tennis shoe with a heel.\"\n"}

The dome measures approximately 108.0 meters making it the largest dome in Asia from its opening in 1960 until 2001 when it was surpassed by the Ōita Stadium in Japan with a dome measuring 274.0 meters.\n\nThe Smart Araneta Coliseum is mostly used for sports such as basketball. It is a main venue of the Philippine Basketball Association and for the basketball games of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the University Athletic Association of the Philippines.\nThe Big Dome is also used for boxing, cockfighting, local and international concerts, circuses, religious gatherings, beauty pageants and more.\n\nIn 1952, J. Amado Araneta, a member of the Araneta family, purchased from Radio Corporation of America (RCA) of land in Cubao which includes the Araneta family home and is bounded by Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue or EDSA, Aurora Boulevard, P. Tuazon and 15th Avenue.\n\nThe Araneta Coliseum was constructed from 1957 to late 1959, and designed and built by Architect Dominador Lacson Lugtu and Engrineer Leonardo Onjunco Lugtu. From 1960 to 1963, the Coliseum received international recognition and was recognized as the largest covered coliseum in the world. Today, it remains one of the largest clear span domes in the world with a dome diameter of 108 meters. It occupies a total land area of almost and has a floor area of .\n\nThe coliseum opened on March 16, 1960, with Gabriel \"Flash\" Elorde boxing for the World Junior Lightweight crown against Harold Gomes. General admission then was 80 centavos and the reserve section was five pesos.\n\nAmong the notable events to take place at the arena were the 11th and 34th FAMAS Awards, the 1975 \"Thrilla in Manila\" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, in which the arena was renamed into the \"Philippine Coliseum\", and the annual Binibining Pilipinas beauty pageant. The Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) has played more than a thousand games at the Araneta Coliseum as of today. Other basketball events hosted by the arena were the 1978 FIBA World Championship, a game between the 1978 NBA champions Washington Bullets and a PBA selection in 1979, and the 1982 Asian Youth Basketball Championship where the Philippines defeated China in the final.\nIn the third quarter of 1998, the Aranetas and Pilipinas Shell (local arm of Royal Dutch Shell) started negotiations for a naming rights deal that would have lasted until 2008. The Aranetas, who wanted to retain their name at the arena rejected proposed name \"Shell Coliseum at the Araneta Center\". Instead, the parties agreed on a contract where Shell's name and logo will be painted at the arena's basketball court, a move that was almost shelved due to objections from other PBA teams because Shell owned the then-PBA team, the Shell Turbo Chargers.\n\nIn 1999, the coliseum underwent its first major renovation at the cost of P200 million. The major changes include the renovation of the lower box area, replacement of seats for the patron and lower box sections, and installation of a four-sided center hung scoreboard. The section names were also given numerical designations: 100 for Patron section, 200 for Lower Box, 300 for Upper Box A and 400 for Upper Box B. In 2003, a LED display was added to the scoreboard.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2008, the highest grossing event at the arena is the Pacquiao vs. Larios boxing fight between Manny Pacquiao and Óscar Larios, earning 96.2 million Philippine pesos. A concert by Westlife was attended by 17,887 people and earned 18.5 million pesos, while a Cliff Richard concert earned 17.2 million despite being watched by 5,647 spectators.\n\nPrior to the Ultimate All-Star Weekend in July 2011, it was announced that the Aranetas entered into a naming rights deal with mobile network operator Smart Communications, Inc. (a subsidiary of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company), renaming the arena into \"Smart Araneta Coliseum\". The deal was for five years and includes improvements the arena such as the installation of escalators to improve access in the upper box and general admission areas, and the construction of a parking lot that can accommodate up to 2,000 cars.\n\nAdditional improvements were made in 2012, including the renovation of the Red Gate entrance and the Green Gate side facade, and the replacement of Upper Box level seats, thus increasing its seating capacity. The Lower Box and Patron sections were combined to make a new Patron section (100 and 200 level seats). A pathway between the former Patron and Lower Box sections was also made. The former Upper Box A section (300 level seats) was renamed as Box section and the former Upper Box B section (400 level seats) is now referred as the \"Upper Box\" section.\n\nIn January 2015, the Hydra-Rib basketball backboard first used in 1995 was replaced with a Spalding backboard. The backboard was first used in Game 1 of the 2014–15 PBA Philippine Cup Finals.\n\nThe arena is primarily the home arena for the Philippine Basketball Association and the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) basketball leagues. It annually hosts every PBA Basketball Championship, NCAA Basketball Championship, as well as the University Athletic Association of the Philippines Basketball and Volleyball championships, and also the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League.\n\nThe facility has also hosted the 1975 Thrilla in Manila, 1978 FIBA World Championship, the 2007 Philippines World Pool Championship and the 2017 SEABA Championship.\n\nThe coliseum will also be one the venues for the upcoming 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nThe coliseum also hosts concerts, shows, graduations, seminars, ice shows, circuses, and beauty pageants.\n\nSarah Geronimo is the youngest solo performer to stage a concert in the coliseum at the age of 16 with her \"Sarah Geronimo: The Other Side\" concert on September 30, 2005. \n\nEat Bulaga!, the longest running noontime show of the Philippines, also used the coliseum for some special events such as its 10th anniversary on September 23, 1989 in ABS-CBN and its move to GMA Network on January 28, 1995.\n\nThe coliseum has hosted the Binibining Pilipinas pageants annually. From 1990 until 2016, the coliseum hosted Disney on Ice productions during the holiday season; in 2016, the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay began hosting these productions.\n\nAt the turn of the new millennium, Regine Velasquez held her iconic two-night sold out concert entitled , in support of her album \"R2K\", on April 7 and 8, 2000.

It is the home ground of Sparta Rotterdam. It has a capacity of 11,026.\n\nThe stadium is located in the neighbourhood of Spangen, where it was built in 1916 as \"Stadion Spangen\" based on a plan of the architects J.H. de Roos and W.F. Overeynder. \nThe name \"Het Kasteel\" (The Castle) is derived from the small building with two small towers which backs onto the south-facing tribune (Kasteel Stand) of the stadium, which looks similar to a castle. This building is the only authentical remain of the original design. It was built in 1916. The castle building, which is currently located along the length of the pitch, was originally positioned behind one of the goals.\n\nA famous incident took place at het Kasteel in November 1970, when Feyenoord goalkeeper Eddy Treijtel took a goalkick and shot a passing seagull down from the air. The stuffed bird has been on display in the museum at Feyenoord's De Kuip stadion and not in Sparta's museum much to the annoyance of some prominent Sparta supporters.\n\nFor the 1928 Summer Olympics in neighboring Amsterdam, the venue hosted two football games. The first was on 5 June when host nation Netherlands defeated Belgium 3-1 while the second was three days later when the Dutch team tied Chile 2-2.\n\nThrough the years, the stands of \"Stadion Sparta\" were often renovated and extended, but the most radical renovation took place in 1998 and 1999: the stadium was completely rebuilt according to a plan of the architects Zwarts & Jansma. During the renovation, the pitch was turned 90 degrees. At the same time, it was renamed \"ENECO-stadion\", after its main sponsor. That name was soon replaced by the present \"Het Kasteel\" (\"The Castle\"), which had already been the popular nickname for the stadium ever since it was built.\n\n\"The Castle\" was bought in November 2004 by businessman Hans van Heelsbergen, the manager of the textile company Hans Textiel and also the chairman of Sparta Rotterdam. Van Heelsbergen opened in this building a Sparta museum (and an outlet of Hans Textiel).\n\nThe Tonny van Ede stand is on the north side of the ground and stands along the length of the pitch, opposite the Kasteel Stand. The most expensive tickets are to be found here. It houses the changing rooms as well as the corporate boxes, the ticket office and the boardroom. The players' tunnel runs from the centre of this stand onto the pitch between the two dugouts. The stand was named after one of Sparta's most famous sons, Tonny van Ede, in 2010.\nThe lowest priced tickets for home fans are to be found in the Denis Neville Stand. This is at the east end of the ground behind one of the goals. It houses the more vocal supporters of the club and is usually the first stand to sell-out.\nThe stand was named in honour of one of Sparta's most successful managers, Denis Neville.\n\nOpposite the Denis Neville Stand, the Bok de Korver Stand is assigned as the family stand but also houses the away fans. Formerly known as the West Stand, it was named after Sparta legend Bok de Korver.\n\nAttached to the historic Kasteel building, the Kasteel Stand is on the south end of the ground and the club shop is based here as well as the Sparta Museum.\n\n"}

The sport's roots have a long history going back many centuries before the televisation of strongman competitions in the 1970s and Iceland has a role in that more ancient heritage. In terms of modern strength athletics, Iceland has held a preeminent position as a nation due to the enormous success of its competitors on the international stage, who between them have won Nine World's Strongest Man titles, and numerous major European and international competitions.\n\nThe origin of Icelanders testing each other through feats and tests of strength predates the introduction of strength athletics and in terms of strength based sports there had been a number of noted powerlifters and weightlifters during the twentieth century. However, in the era of strongman competition Iceland has a record that belies the size of the nation's population having won 9 WSM titles, second only to the USA who have won 11 titles. Before Iceland had its own national competition, it already had men competing on the international circuit. In 1983, the young powerlifter and bodybuilder, Jón Páll Sigmarsson entered the 1983 World's Strongest Man competition and was only beaten into second place by the experienced Geoff Capes. Sigmarsson went on to win the competition the following year and in total won it four times. Sigmarsson was also a six times World Muscle Power champion and winner of the Pure Strength title. His contemporary, and good friend Hjalti Árnason, was also competing at this time and as well as podium finishes in World Muscle Power and World Strongman Challenge, he won the highly regarded Le Defi Mark Ten International competition. Magnús Ver Magnússon followed in their footsteps and emulated Sigmarsson's four WSM titles. There have also been a number of other highly respected Icelandic competitors in the top international events and in 2010 Stefán Sölvi Pétursson achieved a fourth place finish in the 2010 World's Strongest Man.\n\nSince 1985, Iceland has had its own national competition, Iceland's Strongest Man. There have also been three other major titles contested in Iceland, including Strongest Man in Iceland, Iceland's Strongest Man (IFSA) and Iceland's Strongest Viking.\n\nIn 1985, the very first Iceland's Strongest Man contest was staged. Hjalti Árnason was second to Jón Páll that year whilst Magnús Ver Magnússon came third. Thus, in the very first contest the podium finishers would between them go on to win the World's Strongest Man eight times, the World Muscle Power Classic seven times, the World Strongman Challenge, Le Defi Mark Ten International and numerous powerlifting titles including the super-heavyweight IPF World Powerlifting Championships. The contest's profile was immediately internationally renowned and it eventually became an open competition, although if a non-Icelander wins, the title of Iceland's Strongest Man defers to the highest place Icelander. This has only happened on 2 occasions when the legendary Bill Kazmaier and Regin Vagadal of the Faroe Islands won. Terry Hollands and Adrian Rollinson of the United Kingdom and Don Pope of the USA have all placed second.\n\nThe IFSA organised the Iceland's Strongest Man competition for a number of years before 2005. However, when the IFSA disassociated from the World's Strongest Man competition, Iceland's Strongest Man remained the official qualifier with no IFSA involvement. The IFSA did continue to promote their own version until their financial demise at the end of 2008.\n\n\nIn 2010, this contest was held for the nineteenth time, dating it back to 1992. In some years the results of this contest have been combined with those of Iceland's Strongest Man in order to ascertain who qualifies for the World's Strongest Man.\n\nThe Nordic Strongman Championships consists of athletes from Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark.\n"}

It utilizes the complex training of tank crews including their rough terrain passing skills combined with the ability to provide accurate and rapid fire while performing maneuvers.\n\nParticipating tanks drive a three-lap route of 6–10 km. During the first lap, crews fire at targets positioned at distances of 1,800, 1,700 and 1,500 m. In the second lap, different targets imitating an anti-tank mortar (RPG) squad and an infantry unit are fired upon. These targets are at a distance of 600–700 m, and must be engaged with a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun. In the third lap the tank crews fire at targets shaped like an anti-tank gun and ATGM unit using of the turret-mounted heavy machine gun at a distance of 1,200 m. One or more misses leads to an extra penalty lap 500 m long. On the final lap tanks have to go through various terrain obstacles; an obstacle missed or improperly traversed adds 10 seconds to the crew's final timing.\n\nThe United States received an official invitation in 2013 and an unofficial invitation in 2017. In 2014, 41 countries received the invitation.\n\nThe first international tank biathlon competition was held at the Alabino proving ground in the Moscow Oblast, on 12–17 August 2013. Four teams took part in the competition: Russia, Armenia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.\n\nThe took place at the Alabino proving ground on 4–16 August 2014. Out of 41 nations that received invitation to the tournament, 12 sent their representatives. Every competitor (except Teams China and Russia) received a T-72B tank in the biathlon color scheme. Team Russia piloted the newest modification, T-72B3, and Team China brought their own Type 96A.\n\nRussian preliminaries for the event ran in several of military districts of Russia. Each district sent its top crews to compete for the Cup of Russia, and 3 finalists from that event formed the national Team Russia for the World Championship.\n\nParticipating nations also held preliminaries on their own, sending 3 top crews and a reserve crew accompanied by maintenance and repair personnel to Russia.\n\nRandom selection placed teams under following colors:\n\nFirst legs of the tournament consisted of:\n\n\nThe final competition was a relay race, the top 4 teams fielded all their crews taking turns.\n\nThe second event of the series took part on 1–15 August 2015 at the same venue in Alabino.

Consequently, Belarus won 3 gold, 50 silver and 249 bronze awards and finished 3rd in the total medal score of the Army Games, being surpassed only by Russia and China.\n\nThe Nicaragua and Tajikistan national teams joined the event for the first time.\n\nAll teams were piloting upgraded T-72B3 tanks, excluding Team China which continued to field its own Type 96A.\n\nList of participants with color scheme:\n\nThe third Tank Biathlon took place in Alabino as part of the on 30 July–13 August.\n\nThe fourth Tank Biathlon took place in Alabino, Moscow Region.

{"id": "22420946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22420946", "title": "Treadmill with Vibration Isolation Stabilization", "text": "Treadmill with Vibration Isolation Stabilization\n\nThe Treadmill with Vibration Isolation Stabilization System, commonly abbreviated as TVIS, is a treadmill for use on board the International Space Station and is designed to allow astronauts to run without vibrating delicate microgravity science experiments in adjacent labs. International Space Station treadmills, not necessarily described here, have included the original treadmill, the original TVIS, the БД-2, the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill (COLBERT), and the Treadmill 2 (abbreviated as T2). Some share a name, some a design, some a function, some use different (passive) vibration-suppression systems, some it is unclear how they differ.\n\nThe name for the treadmill (COLBERT) came about due to a naming contest that NASA held for what became the Tranquility module. Comedian and TV personality Stephen Colbert used his show \"The Colbert Report\" to encourage his viewers to write in votes to use \"Colbert\" during the contest. After the results of the contest were announced, NASA decided to use Colbert's name for the new treadmill in place of naming the Tranquility module after him.\n\nFollowing the advent of space stations that can be inhabited for long periods of time, exposure to weightlessness has been demonstrated to have some deleterious effects on human health. Humans are well-adapted to the physical conditions at the surface of the Earth. In response to an extended period of weightlessness, various physiological systems begin to change and atrophy. Though these changes are usually temporary, long term health issues can result.\n\nThe most common problem experienced by humans in the initial hours of weightlessness is known as space adaptation syndrome or SAS, commonly referred to as space sickness. Symptoms of SAS include nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The first case of SAS was reported by cosmonaut Gherman Titov in 1961. Since then, roughly some 45% to 75% of all people who have flown in space have suffered from this condition. The duration of space sickness varies, but in no case has it lasted for more than 72 hours, after which the body adjusts to the new environment.\n\nThe most significant adverse effects of long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face. These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.\n\nTo prevent some of the effects associated with weightlessness, a treadmill with vibration isolation and stabilization designed for the International Space Station (ISS) was first evaluated during STS-81. Three crew members ran and walked on the device, which floats freely in the micro-gravity experienced during orbit. For the majority of the more than 2 hours of locomotion studied, the treadmill operated well, and vibration transmitted to the vehicle was within the micro-gravity allocation limits that are defined for the ISS. Refinements to the treadmill and harness system, which ultimately led to development of the COLBERT model, were studied after this first flight. One goal of the treadmill design is to offer the possibility of generating 1 g-like loads on the lower extremities while preserving the micro-gravity environment of the ISS for structural safety and vibration free experimental conditions.\n\nThe treadmills are intended to help astronauts stay fit, fighting off the bone loss (spaceflight osteopenia) and muscle decay that otherwise comes with space travel. Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill in order to remain in contact with the equipment while in micro-gravity. Researchers believe that exercise is a good countermeasure for the bone and muscle density loss that occurs when humans live for a long time without gravity.\n\nThe original Treadmill with Vibration Isolation Stabilization (TVIS) that was recessed into the floor of the Zvezda Service Module was decommissioned in June 2013, disposed of on the Russian Progress (50P) in July 2013 and replaced by the Russian БД-2.\n\nExpedition 20 flight engineers Michael Barratt and Koichi Wakata have performed a complete overhaul of that treadmill to extend its life. Both treadmills will continue to be used, which will nearly double the availability of these critical work-out devices for space station crews.\n\nTreadmill with Vibration Isolation Stabilization system (TVIS) also required repair in 2002, during Expedition 5 while STS-112 was docked. Valery Korzun spent an entire day performing maintenance on the unit.\n\nA serious design flaw with COLBERT power system was discovered in September 2010, within 10 months of being commissioned. A multiple day IFM was required in October in order to remove COLBERT from its rack and replace key power components.\n\nIn early 2009 NASA held an online poll to name what became the Tranquility module. On the 3 March 2009 episode of \"The Colbert Report\", host Stephen Colbert instructed his viewers to suggest \"Colbert\" as the name for Node 3 in the online poll. On 23 March 2009, it was announced that \"Colbert\" had garnered the most votes, but NASA did not immediately commit to using the name.\n\nCongressman Chaka Fattah had pledged to use congressional power to ensure that democratic voting is honored in outer space as well as on planet Earth, in response to the possibility that NASA would overrule the voting. On the 14 April 2009 episode of \"The Colbert Report\", astronaut Sunita Williams appeared on the show to announce that NASA decided to name the node 3 \"Tranquility\", the eighth most popular response in the census, and announced that they would name a new treadmill on the station after the comedian – Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill (COLBERT). Colbert was invited to Houston to test the treadmill, and later to Florida for its launch. The treadmill was taken to the ISS in August 2009, aboard STS-128 and was installed in the Tranquility module after the node arrived at the station in February 2010.\n\nNASA poked fun at itself in a humorous press release included in the STS-128 flight day 6 execute package report which claimed that Jon Stewart demanded to be honored similarly but turned down the agency's offer to name the ISS Urine Processor \"Space Toilet Environmental Waste Accumulator/Recycling Thingy\" (STEWART).\n\nNASA Engineers started development with a Woodway medical treadmill design which is available to anyone on Earth, and they asked Woodway to nickel plate the parts and make some other modifications, but it is fundamentally the same running-in-place device as the commercially available model. The structures which support the treadmill are a different story. Without gravity to hold the runner to the surface of the treadmill, designers added elastic straps that fit around the shoulders and waist in order to keep the runner from rocketing across the space station with the first hard step. Designers also had to work out a way to keep the treadmill from shaking the whole station with every step. Preventing vibrations is relatively easy to do on Earth, but the station is floating just like the astronauts are, and it wants to react against any movement that is made inside of it. Even small actions can shake up delicate microgravity experiments taking place inside the station's laboratories. Developing a system to stop the vibrations was the biggest challenge, Wiederhoeft said.\n\nThe first station treadmill, which was brought to the Space Station aboard STS-98, relied on a powered system of gyroscopes and mechanisms to reduce vibrations. COLBERT's Vibration Isolation System was designed to work without power, and also to be more reliable than its predecessor. COLBERT will rest on springs that are hooked to dampers, which are then connected to a standard-sized rack that has been extensively reinforced in order to handle the power produced by COLBERT users. The rack alone weighs 2,200 pounds, which is its contractual design limit, and is also louder than the first treadmill which is a trade-off Wiederhoeft said is necessary to increase its reliability. \"Noise and reliability are fighting against each other here,\" Wiederhoeft said. \"With a lot more time we could have had both quiet and reliable. We went for reliable, and did what we could with noise.\"\n\nDevelopment of the treadmills was also utilized in order to further development of commercial products. Possible secondary effects of development include improved vibration and acoustic isolation applications in sensitive equipment such as equipment used in optical, microelectronic and precision manufacturing.\n\nA team of engineers was required in order to prepare COLBERT to survive the rigorous vibrations of the launch process. COLBERT had to be disassembled into scores of parts, separated into more than six bags and strapped to racks inside the \"Leonardo\" cargo module, which flew to the International Space Station aboard STS-128. COLBERT was delivered to the Space Station in 2010, and resided first inside the Harmony module, before later being moved to the Tranquility module.\n\nThe packing team set out to make sure everything that is launched reaches the station in good working order. \"If it's the COLBERT, or if it's something else, it's still not going to be useful in orbit if it's broken,\" said Pete Gauthier, packing engineer for United Space Alliance. \"The difference with something like this is that it's big and it's heavy, so we have to use our biggest bag,\" he said. \"It's easier for the crew if you have all the pieces in one bag, but when you have six bags, you just can't do that.\" The astronauts on the station are expected to spend about 20 hours putting the whole thing together, including the vibration system. After assembly, the only care COLBERT should need is an occasional greasing of its bearings.\n"}
