{"id": "5831410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5831410", "title": "Adidas Predator", "text": "Adidas Predator\n\nAdidas Predator are a range of football boots developed by German sportswear manufacturers Adidas based on a prototype concept from the Australian former footballer Craig Johnston. The common feature of the Predator range is the presence of rubber patches or strips on the top of the shoe, designed to increase friction between the boot and the ball. In late 2010, Adidas designed the new \"Power-spine\" technology, which they claim improves shot power by reducing the amount the foot bends back as it kicks the ball.\n\nIn 2014, Hungarian inventor László Oroszi won a court case against Adidas in relation to the \"Predator Precision\" range, forcing Adidas to pay royalties on that range of the boot.\n\nThe Predator line was discontinued in May 2015 for football but was brought back in late 2017 to replace the ACE boots whereas the rugby line is still going strong. The new elite level predator brought back by adidas is named the Predator 18+, which features a primeknit upper with a laceless design as in Ace 16+ and 17+. The boost insole which was used in the Ace 17+ was also used on the new predator. There is a laced variant which is also available.\n\nFootballer Craig Johnston retired from the game in 1988 to return to his native Australia to help care for his seriously injured sister. Whilst coaching a group of schoolchildren in Australia, he came across the idea of using rubber instead of leather to build ridges on the top of a football boot to, theoretically, aid control of the ball.\n\nJohnston spent a lot of time and money developing prototypes and experimenting with designs. Those designs were rejected by various sports shoe manufacturers, including Adidas. He then persuaded German footballers Franz Beckenbauer, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Paul Breitner to be filmed whilst using his prototype football boots in snowy conditions. This was enough to convince Adidas to take up Johnston's design, buying the rights with Johnston receiving a 2% share of all sales.\n\nThere have been 12 different predator models, with a cheaper version without all the predator technology going by a different name. For example, the Predator Pulse's budget variant was called the Pulsado.\nThe eponymous \"Predator elements\" have developed over time. The principle behind the project, however, involves attaching rubber strips to the forefoot that Adidas says increases the speed of the ball. The initial focus in Predator commercials was on shooting strength, but this gradually move more to the effect on ball spin and precision. The first Predators were also available without Predator elements under a different name. While the Predators were made of black kangaroo-leather with white stripes and red elements, the equivalent boots without Predator technology were black with white stripes and blue accents. The Precision equivalent, however, was black and white only, while the Supernova (Predator Mania without the Predator elements) was black with either silver or gold heel caps and stripes. David Beckham wore these boots for most of his career, as did Zinedine Zidane.\n\nThe original Adidas Predator was made of leather. It featured rubber ridges. It only came in a few colors, black with white stripes and red accents. This color scheme is now known as the main one for all predators. The first goal scored by a professional footballer using Predator boots in a top-level match was by John Collins for Celtic in April 1994. He scored the opening goal in a 1–1 draw at Ibrox Stadium against Rangers, direct from a free-kick on the edge of the penalty box.\n\nThe Predator Rapiers (named this as most footballers could kick with them on) also were the first Adidas soccer boots available in different colors. Until then, Adidas soccer boots were made of black leather. The Rapier, however, was also (as a limited series) available in white and red, as were the next two models. Beginning with the Mania, Adidas started to produce its Predator boots in countless color variants. Moreover, one color was called David Beckham's style.\n\nThe Predator Touch was different in many ways. It featured the Traxion (trx) studs, which were rectangular and anatomically placed. Before, studs had always been round. For professional players who preferred the old studs, Adidas produced special Predators with a different outsole.\n\nThe Predator Accelerator version was released in 1998 to coincide with the FIFA world cup held in France. This boot featured a re-engineered TRX (traxion) outsole, asymmetrical lacing, fore-footed rubber vamps sewn into the leather, and a \"feet you wear\" insole. It has been regarded as one of the best boots Adidas have produced to date. The boot was modelled by some of the greatest players such as Alessandro Del Piero, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham.\n\nThe Adidas Predator Accelerator came out in four different colourways:\n\nTwo generations of this boot were produced: The '98 version can be distinguished by two red patches on the heel, whereas the '99 version does not have these red patches on the heel.\n\nFurthermore, the same model was released in the colours of black/blue but without the \"Predator\" elements. This was a slightly cheaper alternative to the Predator Accelerator. This version was simply called the Adidas Accelerator.\n\nThe \"Predator Precision\" introduced replaceable Traxion studs that were fitted by the tightening of a minute screw. These studs were available in various lengths that made the boot adjustable to ground conditions as is possible with the classic screw-in soft-ground studs. There were, however, some reliability problems, as the studs would come loose quite often, thus needing more constant maintenance than the classic screw-ins. In 2001 came a completely revised model which had a similar stripe configuration and colourway but the predator technology was revised and bore more of a resemblance to Predator Accelerators.\n\nControversy arose over the boot's ball-directing striped-line zone in 2002 when Hungarian football gear inventor László Oroszi launched a copyright lawsuit against Adidas. Oroszi had registered the patent in Hungary in 1996, explaining that the striped zone at the tip of the shoe permitted footballers to shoot more accurately. Oroszi's representative presented the patent to Adidas in 1998, but Adidas declined the offer claiming that it did not fit into their concept for the then new \"Predator Precision\" shoes. Eventually in 2014, the Hungarian Courts ruled that Adidas had incorporated Oroszi's deisgn into their \"Predator Precision\" shoes and that he is entitled to compensation.\n\nAdidas released the \"Predator Mania\" to coincide with the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan. They designed it with a \"Far Eastern\" style in mind, so it had sharp angular styling and came in various colour schemes in addition to the traditional black–red design. These included the \"champagne\", a champagne-white colour, and the \"champagne gold\", a gold pearl-like white, although just stud background and heel cup was gold. These were worn by David Beckham, Alessandro Del Piero and Raúl. These were available in the \"XTRX Blades\" for soft ground use, which came with a stud key and could be loosened or tightened at the owners comfort and also the red firm ground blades for hard surfaces. These were not detachable and came fixated to the boot. A limited edition version was also released in \"Japan Blue\" and was worn by Alex of the Japan national team during the tournament. During the 2002–03 playing season, they also released an all-red version with the Adidas stripes in silver.\n\nProblems with reliability of the \"XTRX Blades\" meant a revised version was released in late 2003, which incorporated minor changes to the layout and design of the studs. In addition to this, with the revision, Adidas also released the boots with traditional screw in studs which were previously only available to professional players who had the boots custom designed by Adidas. Two new colours were released: \"lunar\", which came out in March 2003, and \"gun metal\", which was released in time for the 2003–04 playing season. The final revision of this boot came with the release of the HG (Hard Ground) sole, which was the same as the FG, except that the studs were black instead of red and were joined up and more robust with the boots intended to be used on third generation and synthetic surfaces. \"Blue Mania\" were only released in small numbers, primarily in the North American market, Japan and Korea; they are rare in Europe.\n\nWith the success of the \"Mania\" in 2002, Adidas launched a budget version of the boot called the \"Manado\". This featured all the key characteristics of the Mania boot but with small cosmetic differences. A cheaper young cow leather was used in comparison to the \"Mania\"'s kangaroo skin leather. There was also a difference in the size and length of the tongues on each boot, compared to the \"Mania\" and the achillies protector on the heel was not plastic. Differences in the studs and colouring of the under sole are also evident, although the differences can be hard to notice at a glance, the \"Manados\" are often mistaken for \"Manias\" even though the recommended retail price of the \"Manados\" was £60, opposed to the £120 of the \"Manias\".\n\nWith the difference in leather and other features, the \"Predator Mania FG\" is intended as the peak of the \"Predator\" range. With the line discontinued in late 2003, the boot has long been out of stock. There has been a retro version which was released in 2017 in the champagne colorway, its limited quantities made people sell them on eBay at monstrous prices.\n\nThe \"Predator\" \"Pulse\" was introduced in late 2003, before UEFA Euro 2004. The first colour released was black and red (original). This Predator is the first boot include what Adidas calls the \"Power Pulse System\", and only \"Predator Pulse\" can't change to the original insole.\n\nAdidas introduced PowerPulse in the Predator Pulse in late 2003, and continued with the \"Predator Absolute\" in November 2005. Adidas claims the PowerPulse sockliner shifts the boot’s centre of gravity closer to the point of impact, which they say offers more powerful shots on goal. Most of absolute's PowerPulse is 40g, however only Red version is 60g.\n\nA very limited edition of this boot was released called the David Beckham Ying Yang box set. Only 723 pairs of these were released and came in a wooden md glass display box with a small book. Retail price was £699 in the UK for this box set but it is now very sought after by collectors.\n\nThe \"Predator Absolute\" introduced in mid-2006, just before the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The first colour schemes were black/red, white/gold and blue/white. This Predator is the first with changeable PowerPulse sockliners which allows the exchange of the sockliner between the normal 40g and a lighter weight one, with no intentional weight added. Adidas made gold/white Absolute for Zinedine Zidane to celebrate his last international tournament.\n\nWith the \"Predator PowerSwerve\" in late 2007, Adidas introduced a foam material they call Smartfoam. They claim it gives the Predator element more rebound power, swerve, and improved control through longer ball contact. Zinedine Zidane helped to develop the new Predator PowerSwerve boot. After ending his active career, he worked together with the Adidas innovation team (a.i.t) in the further evolution of the new boot.\nScientific tests have shown that, in comparison to its predecessor, the Predator PowerSwerve can achieve up to eight percent more swerve and increase the power behind every shot by around three percent. The Dynamic PowerPulse technology in the sole of the boot and the special hi-tech foam in the forefoot upper material make these improvements possible. The PowerPulse element filled with tungsten powder, which shifts weight toward the point of impact, enables players to put more power behind every shot.\n\nPowerswerve Special is a rugby version of the series. It has a wider last in the boot and rugby hybrid studs.\n\nThe Adidas \"Predator X\" shoes introduced in late 2009 have the \"Powerspine technology\", the Predator element and a host of advancements from Adidas, all intended for better performance. Adidas developed a new upper material they call \"Taurus\" leather. The Adidas Predator X football boots are the first Predator to remove the tongue, which Adidas says improves performance. They claim it reduces the material between the ball and boot to give better ball feel, and that the new boot collar gives a more secure fit.\n\nPredator RX is a rugby version of the special, with a wider last and rugby specific predator vamp.\n\nFootballers such as David Beckham, Xavi, Robin van Persie, Michael Ballack, Raúl, Steven Gerrard, Dirk Kuyt, Kolo Touré, Edwin van der Sar, Petr Čech, Brad Friedel, Anderson and Eiður Guðjohnsen have all worn Adidas Predators. Zinedine Zidane tested and reviewed the newest version of the Predator range(Predator X).\n\nAdidas released the Predator X in the traditional black/white/red colourway, with a contrasting white/brown/yellow colourway to accompany it. Later, Adidas released other colourways including the usual David Beckham designed white/red colourway, with a dragon design on the rubber Predator element; also released were the blue/white/red. For the 2010 World Cup, Adidas released a black/sun colourway to follow on a colourway they used for all three of their boot styles (F50 adiZero and adiPure), later came the white/sky/cyan and back/white/cyan colourways, followed by another David Beckham designed Collegiate Red/White colourway.\n\nFor the winter of the 2010–11 season, Adidas released the Predator X in two new colourways, electricity/black/poppy and black/Running-White/electricity; David Beckham will also be getting another personalised colourway in white/blue. Steven Gerrard has been given the option of a Miadidas Predator which he personalised as black/gold/red.\n\nReleased in May 2011, the Adidas adiPower Predator saw a shift in focus for the Predator range with the release of the new adiPower. The \"Powerspine\" technology has been retained, providing greater shooting power by minimizing energy loss. The Predator element on the instep of the boot has been split into two performance zones. The power zone incorporates 3D fins for power, while the silicon rubber Predator element provides swerve and ball control. The adiPower Predator now features the Sprint Frame outsole, originally created for the F50, making it 25% lighter than the Predator X. Real Madrid's Kaká and Manchester United's Nani wore the adiPower Predators.\n\nThe adiPower, like other Adidas football boots released in 2011, faced an increase in price, with RRP set as £155 in the UK and $200 in the United States. They weigh in at 7.8 ounces.\n\nThe adidas Adipower Predator SL was released on 24 June 2011 as the lightest Predator yet, offered in a Black/Blue colorway at a retail price of $250 USD. This incarnation of the Predator used the revolutionary SprintSkin upper used in the popular F50 Adizero line and weighed just 211 grams.\n\nReleased in May 2012, but previously tested by professionals in blackout versions, the next Predators will be called the LZ due to the five \"lethal zones\" on the boots. Previously referred to as the D5 due to the same five zones being called deadly, Adidas changed the name in the build up to their release. In a change for the Predators, they will have a synthetic leather upper and these will be the first Predator boots with miCoach capability. The Predator LZ features that same SprintFrame and stud configuration that is found in several other ranges such as the adipure and F50 adiZero. The first zone is called \"first touch\". It is on the front of the boot. It supposedly gives the wearer a good first touch. The second zone is called \"dribble\". It is on the side of the boot and supposedly gives a better touch. The third is called \"drive\". This is the classic predator zone in the striking part of the foot, used for long passes down the field and more powerful shots. The fourth is called \"pass\". It is made up of extra foam with a bit of tacky material in the passing zone. The last one is called \"sweet spot\". It is on the side of the big toe and is helpful for giving spin and chipping.\n\nIn November 2012, Adidas unveiled a new lightweight version of the Predator LZ, aptly named the Predator LZ SL. The boot still features Lethal Zones, miCoach technology and the same soleplate. It is in the upper material where they are differentiated. Rather than using the Hybrid S-L seen in the regular LZ, Adidas employ a thinner SprintSkin on the back end of the LZ SL. This boot weighed in at 7.3oz.\n\nIn May 2013, Adidas officially released the updated version of the Predator LZ, named the Predator LZ II, and it was debuted by several players in Europe, including Napoli's Pepe Reina; Chelsea's Fernando Torres, Oscar and Petr Čech; Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Özil and Per Mertesacker; Real Madrid's Ángel Di María and Xabi Alonso; and Manchester United's Juan Mata. First released in a Ray Green colourway, the next-generation Predator boasts new raised rubber lethal zones which add increased friction between your foot and the ball for ultimate control, touch, passing and shooting. Other features include the HybridTouch upper which is designed for optimal performance in all weather conditions and Traxion 2.0 stud configuration and SprintFrame soleplate.\n\n\n"}

Typically, a user ascends or descends the campus board using only their hands. Campus boards can take a variety of different forms and may incorporate a variety of materials. As one example, a campus board may comprise horizontal thin slats or rails of wood attached to an inclined board in a ladderlike configuration. However, some implementations may utilize bolt on climbing holds or sections of pipe. A campus board is generally set at overhanging angle of inclination that is between vertical and 20 degrees. One consideration for selecting the angle of inclination is the avoidance of any interference that may result between the user's legs and the campus board or wall.\n\nThe campus board was invented by Wolfgang Güllich in 1988 while he was training for a new route, Action Directe, which requires extreme dynamic finger strength. The first campus board was hung at a university in a gym called The Campus Centre. Hence the term \"campus\" has been applied to the name of the training board, training method, and style of climbing, or \"campusing\" in which only the user's hands and arms are used. In French and in Italian, the campus board is referred to as \"pan Güllich\".\n\nThere are a variety of training approaches that may be used with a campus board. As one example, a user may alternate the use of specific fingers to increase finger strength when ascending or descending the board. As another example, upper-body strength may be increased by utilizing large lunges between specific rails or holds of the campus board (Power throws). Reactive training may be used to increase muscle recruitment by dynamically moving between the campus board rails simultaneously with both hands. Training on a campus board may result in better performance due to the improvement of motor training, increased finger strength on a variety of grips, and greater power and lock-off strength of the arms.\n\n"}

Genoa went into their final match of the season against Venezia on 11 June 2005, having already secured promotion, and duly beat Venezia 3–2. However, three days later, it was discovered that Stefano Capozucca, a director of Genoa, had paid Venezia director Giuseppe Pagliara €250,000 for his team to intentionally lose the match.\n\nIt was later found that the principal protagonists behind the scandal were Genoa's president, Enrico Preziosi, and Venezia's president, Franco Dal Cin.\n\nOn 8 August 2005, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) determined that Genoa would be relegated to Serie C1 with a three point penalty; it was the second time in Genoa's history that they had dropped out of the top two divisions, the first being in 1970.

It was formed in 2001 with the merger of the Scottish Chess Association (SCA) and the Scottish Junior Chess Association (SJCA).\n\nIt is one of the oldest national chess associations in the world, the SCA having been founded in 1884. As the national organisation for chess, Chess Scotland is the affiliate to the International Chess Federation (FIDE) and appoints the Scottish delegate to FIDE’s Council. Its International Director is responsible for selecting the teams which represent Scotland at the biennial Chess Olympiad.\n\nIts principal objective is to \"foster and promote the game of chess throughout Scotland among players of all ages\".\n\nIts principal functions are:\n\n\nChess Scotland's functions are performed by unpaid volunteers and is registered as a non-profit organisation. Its turn-over in 2009 was approximately £35,000, of which a third was provided by the Scottish Government via annual grant aid. In 2013 the Government grant ceased.\n\nMany people can play chess and a significant proportion of these have an active interest in the game (e.g., internet chess, parents/guardians of junior players, etc.). The number of players currently known to CS is more than 5000, of whom about half are juniors. Approximately 3000 currently-active players have played sufficient games in official events (not necessarily events organized by CS) to be assigned a national rating (grade) for their standard of play. Chess Scotland therefore serves a very wide constituency from school children to International Grandmasters.\n\nThe affairs of Chess Scotland are managed by its directors and other officials who work (with other promoters, as appropriate) to fulfil the objectives of the organisation. Most of these posts are filled by election at the Annual General Meeting of Chess Scotland. Chess events are supervised by certified arbiters who must undergo written and practical competency tests administered by Chess Scotland. Chess Scotland also maintains a register of approved coaches and chaperons. All of these officials (arbiters, coaches and chaperons) are required to undergo “Disclosure” certification, under Scottish Child Protection legislation.\n\nApart from the publicity surrounding its events, Chess Scotland’s activities are communicated to the general public (including children) and to its sponsors via its internet web-pages. An on-line forum promotes discussion of chess-related topics of current interest. In addition, Chess Scotland publishes a magazine which appears six times a year.\n\nThe Chess Scotland on-line rating system is important for many players, and the rating system is a source of significant revenue to Chess Scotland. Application to Chess Scotland for the recognition of an event (or player) for rating purposes brings the event (or player) within the jurisdiction of Chess Scotland.\n\nChess Scotland have been successful in bidding for the 2014 Commonwealth Chess Championships and they will be held in Glasgow.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1995024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995024", "title": "Cycle polo", "text": "Cycle polo\n\nCycle polo is a team sport, similar to traditional polo, except that bicycles are used instead of horses. There are 2 versions of the sport: grass and Hardcourt Bike Polo. The hardcourt game has seen a sharp spike in interest as of 2007 and new teams are sprouting up across the world - in China, Canada, Ireland, Switzerland, France, India, Germany, Pakistan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Hungary, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, England, Scotland, Argentina, Italy, Spain, USA, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Nepal, Brazil and Cuba.\n\nTraditional cycle polo is played in a rectangular grass field, 150 meters by 100 meters officially, unofficially whatever field is big enough. Moreover, official dimensions can vary between 120 and 150 meters in length on 80 to 100 meters in width. The ball used approximately 2.5 inches in diameter and the mallet is of length 1 meter.\n\nThere are 6 members (7 in France) on a team of which 4 (5 in France) are on field at a time. The other two are used as substitutes. International matches are played for a duration of 30 minutes divided into periods of 7.5 minutes each called as a \"chukkar\". Extra time can be used to determine the winner in case the scores are tied at normal time.\n\nIf a deliberate foul is committed at the vicinity of the goal, the team that is fouled is automatically given a goal. Less severe fouls are awarded 15 metre and 25 metre free hits. In the event of deliberate fouls or dangerous fouls, the umpire can issue the Yellow card (warning) and in case of repeated or severe fouls the Red card (ejection). The ejected player can be replaced by a substitute after the end of the current \"chukkar\" if the umpire allows it.\n\nIn recent years, an alternate form of the game known as \"Hardcourt Bike Polo\" has grown in popularity. In this variation, teams composed of three players compete on tennis courts, street hockey rinks, or whatever other surfaces are available. The rules vary slightly by city.\n\nGenerally this is a faster game with 3 members on a team, no substitutions, and all members are on the court at all times. A street hockey ball is used and matches are played until one team scores 5 points or time has expired, without playing chukkars. During tournament play a time limit, such as 10 minutes, may be used to maximize the number of tournament rounds possible during the day.\n\nThere are three core rules of play:\n\nIn the case of a 'foot down' or 'dab' (touching the ground with one's foot) the player must \"tap out\" by riding to mid-court and hitting a designated area with their mallet. There is usually a tap-out located on either side of the court.\n\nIn order to score, the offensive player must hit the ball across the goal line using the narrow end of the mallet - called a \"shot\" or \"hit.\" Hitting the ball across the goal line with the wide end of the mallet is called a \"shuffle\".\n\nWhen your team scores a goal, you wait back in your end for the other team (player or ball, whichever comes first) to cross half before engaging in play again.\n\nThe North American Hardcourt Bike Polo Association has created an official ruleset, which has helped standardize rules across the globe.\n\nThe game was invented in County Wicklow, Ireland, in 1891 by retired champion cyclist Richard J. Mecredy, editor of \"The Irish Cyclist\" magazine. In October of that year the first cycle polo match was played at the Scalp (County Wicklow) between \"Rathclaren Rovers\" and the \"Ohne Hast Cycling Club\".\nTowards the end of the 19th century the game reached Great Britain, France, and the United States where the American Star Bicycle was a popular mount. The first international match was played between Ireland and England in 1901. Cycle polo was a demonstration sport at the 1908 London Olympics with Ireland winning the gold, beating Germany.\n\nThe sport reached its peak of popularity in Great Britain during the 1930s with the introduction of the regional leagues. Cycle polo also flourished in France during this period with the establishment of the French league. Internationals between France and Great Britain were held regularly. However the Second World War marked the beginning of the demise of cycle polo in Britain. The sport remained in France though, with league championships held regularly until today.\n\nThe 1980s saw the rise of two new powers in cycle polo, India and United States. The Bicycle Polo Association of America was created in 1994. International cycle polo matches staged a comeback in the 1990s with the first world championship organized in 1996 in the USA. Today there is organized cycle polo being played in Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland and USA. Cycle polo was officially recognized by the Union Cycliste Internationale in 2001.\n\nThe Cycle Polo Association of India was officially created in 1966 it has its office in Jaipur, Rajasthan. The first men's nationals were played in 1970 in New Delhi, with the team from Rajasthan emerging victorious.\n\nIn the 2016-17 season, the men's nationals was held in Jodhpur, Rajasthan from 13th Jan 2017 to 16th Jan 2017. Indian Air Force was the champion and Indian Army were the runners-up. The 2016-17 women's nationals was held at Dundlod, Rajasthan from 21st Feb 2017 to 24th Feb 2017. Chhattisgarh defeated Karnataka in the finals.\n\nThe Calcutta Cricket & Football Club hosted the first Merchant’s Cup Cycle Polo tournament in 1973. In 2012, the CC&FC had organised a Cycle Polo Legend's Tournament where great players of yesteryear such as Vijai Singh, Lakshman Singh and Bikram Das participated. Currently, the CC&FC plays host to the March Mug, the Swaroop Bhanjdeo Memorial Tournament and the CC&FC Trophy. Since 2015 onwards, CC&FC has been hosting the CC&FC All India Invitation Cycle Polo Cup which is organised jointly by the CC&FC along with the Cycle Polo Association of Bengal.\n\nIn 2017, the CC&FC All India Invitation Cycle Polo Cup had 7 teams in the men's section and 5 in the women's section. Territorial Army were the eventual champions in the men's section. They defeated Indian Air Force 14:6 in the final. In the women section Chhattisgarh defeating in Bengal in the final. 15:3 was the score line. \n\nIn 2018, in the men's section, the defending champions Territorial Army successfully defended their title by defeating Bengal 12:10 in the final. In the women's section, Bengal easily overcame their opponents Uttar Pradesh 15:0 in the final.\n\nCycle Polo Federation of India received a funding of 2.75 million rupees from central government in 2013 - 14. \n\nThe UK based Pukka Chukkas won the 2012 Acumen Energy Bicycle Polo Cup held at Tiger Tops Karnali on the fringes of the Bardia National Park in Nepal, beating EFG Switzerland in a thrilling final in front of a crowd of over 5,000. The bicycles used in the tournament were donated to local schools and social clubs, and money was raised for the prevention and cure of elephant tuberculosis.\n\nThe European Championships is an annual Bicycle Polo competition for European club teams. It is held over three legs each year in France, Ireland and Britain. The competition began in 2007 following the compromise between French and British/Irish traditional rules. V.C. Frileuse-Sanvic of France were crowned champions of the inaugural competition.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8402", "title": "Diving (sport)", "text": "Diving (sport)\n\nDiving is the sport of jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard, usually while performing acrobatics. Diving is an internationally recognized sport that is part of the Olympic Games. In addition, unstructured and non-competitive diving is a recreational pastime.\n\nDiving is one of the most popular Olympic sports with spectators. Competitors possess many of the same characteristics as gymnasts and dancers, including strength, flexibility, kinaesthetic judgment and air awareness. Some professional divers were originally gymnasts or dancers as both the sports have similar characteristics to diving. Dmitri Sautin holds the record for most Olympic diving medals won, by winning eight medals in total between 1992 and 2008.\n\nAlthough diving has been a popular pastime across the world since ancient times, the first modern diving competitions were held in England in the 1880s. The exact origins of the sport are unclear, though it likely derives from the act of diving at the start of swimming races. The 1904 book \"Swimming\" by Ralph Thomas notes English reports of plunging records dating back to at least 1865. The 1877 edition to \"British Rural Sports\" by John Henry Walsh makes note of a \"Mr. Young\" plunging 56 feet in 1870, and also states that 25 years prior, a swimmer named Drake could cover 53 feet.\n\nThe English Amateur Swimming Association (at the time called the Swimming Association of Great Britain) first started a \"plunging championship\" in 1883. The Plunging Championship was discontinued in 1937.\n\nDiving into a body of water had also been a method used by gymnasts in Germany and Sweden since the early 19th century. The soft landing allowed for more elaborate gymnastic feats in midair as the jump could be made from a greater height. This tradition evolved into 'fancy diving', while diving as a preliminary to swimming became known as 'Plain diving'.\n\nIn England, the practice of high diving – diving from a great height – gained popularity; the first diving stages were erected at the Highgate Ponds at a height of 15 feet in 1893 and the first world championship event, the National Graceful Diving Competition, was held there by the Royal Life Saving Society in 1895. The event consisted of standing and running dives from either 15 or 30 feet.\n\nIt was at this event that the Swedish tradition of fancy diving was introduced to the sport by the athletes Otto Hagborg and C F Mauritzi. They demonstrated their acrobatic techniques from the 10m diving board at Highgate Pond and stimulated the establishment of the Amateur Diving Association in 1901, the first organization devoted to diving in the world (later amalgamated with the Amateur Swimming Association). Fancy diving was formally introduced into the championship in 1903.\n\nPlain diving was first introduced into the Olympics at the 1904 event. The 1908 Olympics in London added 'fancy diving' and introduced elastic boards rather than fixed platforms. Women were first allowed to participate in the diving events for the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.\n\nIn the 1928 Olympics, 'plain' and 'fancy' diving was amalgamated into one event – 'Highboard Diving'. The diving event was first held indoors in the Empire Pool for the 1934 British Empire Games and 1948 Summer Olympics in London.\n\nMost diving competitions consist of three disciplines: 1 m and 3 m springboards, and the platform. Competitive athletes are divided by gender, and often by age group. In platform events, competitors are allowed to perform their dives on either the five, seven and a half (generally just called seven), nine, or ten meter towers. In major diving meets, including the Olympic Games and the World Championships, platform diving is from the 10 meter height.\nDivers have to perform a set number of dives according to established requirements, including somersaults and twists. Divers are judged on whether and how well they completed all aspects of the dive, the conformance of their body to the requirements of the dive, and the amount of splash created by their entry to the water. A possible score out of ten is broken down into three points for the takeoff (meaning the hurdle), three for the flight (the actual dive), and three for the entry (how the diver hits the water), with one more available to give the judges flexibility.\n\nThe raw score is multiplied by a degree of difficulty factor, derived from the number and combination of movements attempted. The diver with the highest total score after a sequence of dives is declared the winner.\n\nSynchronized diving was adopted as an Olympic sport in 2000. Two divers form a team and perform dives simultaneously. The dives are identical. It used to be possible to dive opposites, also known as a pinwheel, but this is no longer part of competitive synchronized diving. For example, one diver would perform a forward dive and the other an inward dive in the same position, or one would do a reverse and the other a back movement. In these events, the diving would be judged both on the quality of execution and the synchronicity – in timing of take-off and entry, height and forward travel.\n\nThere are rules governing the scoring of a dive. Usually a score considers three elements of the dive: the approach, the flight, and the entry. The primary factors affecting the scoring are:\n\n\nEach dive is assigned a \"degree of difficulty\" (DD), which is determined from a combination of the moves undertaken, position used, and height. The DD value is multiplied by the scores given by the judges.\n\nTo reduce the subjectivity of scoring in major meets, panels of five or seven judges are assembled; major international events such as the Olympics use seven-judge panels. For a five-judge panel, the highest and lowest scores are discarded and the middle three are summed and multiplied by the DD. For seven-judge panels, as of the 2012 London Olympics, the two highest scores and two lowest are discarded, leaving three to be summed and multiplied by the DD. (Prior to the London Olympics, the highest and lowest scores were eliminated, and the remaining five scores were multiplied by , to allow for comparison to five-judge panels.) The canceling of scores is used to make it difficult for a single judge to manipulate scores.\n\nThere is a general misconception about scoring and judging. In serious meets, the absolute score is somewhat meaningless. It is the relative score, not the absolute score that wins meets. Accordingly, good judging implies consistent scoring across the dives. Specifically, if a judge consistently gives low scores for all divers, or consistently gives high scores for the same divers, the judging will yield fair relative results and will cause divers to place in the correct order. However, absolute scores have significance to the individual divers. Besides the obvious instances of setting records, absolute scores are also used for rankings and qualifications for higher level meets.\n\nIn synchronised diving events, there is a panel of seven, nine, or eleven judges; two or three to mark the execution of one diver, two or three to mark the execution of the other, and the remaining three or five to judge the synchronisation. The execution judges are positioned two on each side of the pool, and they score the diver which is nearer to them. The 2012 London Olympics saw the first use of eleven judges.\n\nThe score is computed similarly to the scores from other diving events, but has been modified starting with the 2012 London Olympics for the use of the larger judging panels. Each group of judges will have the highest and lowest scores dropped, leaving the middle score for each diver's execution and the three middle scores for synchronization. The total is then weighted by and multiplied by the DD. The result is that the emphasis is on the synchronization of the divers.\n\nThe synchronisation scores are based on:\n\nThe judges may also disqualify the diver for certain violations during the dive, including:\n\nTo win dive meets, divers create a dive list in advance of the meet. To win the meet the diver must accumulate more points than other divers. Often, simple dives with low DDs will look good to spectators but will not win meets. The competitive diver will attempt the highest DD dives possible with which they can achieve consistent, high scores. If divers are scoring 8 or 9 on most dives, it may be a sign of their extreme skill, or it may be a sign that their dive list is not competitive, and they may lose the meet to a diver with higher DDs and lower scores.\n\nIn competition, divers must submit their lists beforehand, and once past a deadline (usually when the event is announced or shortly before it begins) they cannot change their dives. If they fail to perform the dive announced, even if they physically cannot execute the dive announced or if they perform a more difficult dive, they will receive a score of zero. Under exceptional circumstances, a redive may be granted, but these are exceedingly rare (usually for very young divers just learning how to compete, or if some event outside the diver's control has caused them to be unable to perform-such as a loud noise).\n\nIn the Olympics or other highly competitive meets, many divers will have nearly the same list of dives as their competitors. The importance for divers competing at this level is not so much the DD, but how they arrange their list. Once the more difficult rounds of dives begin it is important to lead off with a confident dive to build momentum. They also tend to put a very confident dive in front of a very difficult dive to ensure that they will have a good mentality for the difficult dive. Most divers have pre-dive and post-dive rituals that help them either maintain or regain focus. Coaches also play a role in this aspect of the sport. Many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet. In a large meet coaches are rarely allowed on the deck to talk to their athlete so it is common to see coaches using hand gestures or body movements to communicate.\n\nThere are some American meets which will allow changes of the position of the dive even after the dive has been announced immediately before execution, but these are an exception to the rules generally observed internationally.\n\nGenerally, NCAA rules allow for dives to be changed while the diver is on the board, but the diver must request the change directly after the dive is announced. This applies especially in cases where the wrong dive is announced. If the diver pauses during his or her hurdle to ask for a change of dive, it will be declared a balk (when the diver stops mid-hurdle) and the change of dive will not be permitted.\n\nUnder FINA law, no dive may be changed after the deadline for the dive-sheet to be submitted (generally a period ranging from one hour to 24 hours, depending on the rulings made by the event organiser).\n\nIt is the diver's responsibility to ensure that the dive-sheet is filled in correctly, and also to correct the referee or announcer before the dive if they describe it incorrectly. If a dive is performed which is as submitted but not as (incorrectly) announced, it is declared failed and scores zero according to a strict reading of the FINA law. But in practice, a re-dive would usually be granted in these circumstances.\n\nThe global governing body of diving is FINA, which also governs swimming, synchronised swimming, water polo and open water swimming. Almost invariably, at national level, diving shares a governing body with the other aquatic sports.\n\nThis is frequently a source of political friction as the committees are naturally dominated by swimming officials who do not necessarily share or understand the concerns of the diving community. Divers often feel, for example, that they do not get adequate support over issues like the provision of facilities. Other areas of concern are the selection of personnel for the specialised Diving committees and for coaching and officiating at events, and the team selection for international competitions.\n\nThere are sometimes attempts to separate the governing body as a means to resolve these frustrations, but they are rarely successful. For example, in the UK the Great Britain Diving Federation was formed in 1992 with the intention of taking over the governance of Diving from the ASA (Amateur Swimming Association). Although it initially received widespread support from the diving community, the FINA requirement that international competitors had to be registered with their National Governing Body was a major factor in the abandonment of this ambition a few years later.\n\nSince FINA refused to rescind recognition of the ASA as the British governing body for all aquatic sports including diving, this meant that the elite divers had to belong to ASA-affiliated clubs to be eligible for selection to international competition.\n\nIn the United States scholastic diving is almost always part of the school's swim team. Diving is a separate sport in Olympic and Club Diving. The NCAA will separate diving from swimming in special diving competitions after the swim season is completed.\n\nDespite the apparent risk, the statistical incidence of injury in supervised training and competition is extremely low.\n\nThe majority of accidents that are classified as 'diving-related' are incidents caused by individuals jumping from structures such as bridges or piers into water of inadequate depth. Many accidents also occur when divers do not account for rocks and logs in the water. Because of this many beaches and pools prohibit diving in shallow waters or when a lifeguard is not on duty.\n\nAfter an incident in Washington in 1993, most US and other pool builders are reluctant to equip a residential swimming pool with a diving springboard so home diving pools are much less common these days. In the incident, 14-year-old Shawn Meneely made a \"suicide dive\" (holding his hands at his sides, so that his head hit the bottom first) in a private swimming pool and became a tetraplegic. The lawyers for the family, Jan Eric Peterson and Fred Zeder, successfully sued the diving board manufacturer, the pool builder, and the National Spa and Pool Institute over the inappropriate depth of the pool.\nThe NSPI had specified a minimum depth of 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m) which proved to be insufficient in the above case. The pool into which Meneely dived was not constructed to the published standards. The standards had changed after the diving board was installed on the non-compliant pool by the homeowner. But the courts held that the pool \"was close enough\" to the standards to hold NSPI liable. The multimillion-dollar lawsuit was eventually resolved in 2001 for US$6.6 million ($8 million after interest was added) in favor of the plaintiff. The NSPI was held to be liable, and was financially strained by the case. It filed twice for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was successfully reorganized into a new swimming pool industry association.\n\nIn competitive diving, FINA takes regulatory steps to ensure that athletes are protected from the inherent dangers of the sport. For example, they impose restrictions according to age on the heights of platforms which divers may compete on.\n\n\nGroup D divers have only recently been allowed to compete on the tower. In the past, the age group could compete only springboard, to discourage children from taking on the greater risks of tower diving. Group D tower was introduced to counteract the phenomenon of coaches pushing young divers to compete in higher age categories, thus putting them at even greater risk.\n\nHowever, some divers may safely dive in higher age categories to dive on higher platforms. Usually this occurs when advanced Group C divers wish to compete on the 10 m.\n\nPoints on pool depths in connection with safety:\n\n\nThere are six \"groups\" into which dives are classified: \"Forward, Back, Inward, Reverse, Twist,\" and \"Armstand\". The latter applies only to Platform competitions, whereas the other five apply to both Springboard and Platform.\n\nDuring the flight of the dive, one of four positions is assumed:\n\nThese positions are referred to by the letters A, B, C and D respectively.\n\nAdditionally, some dives can be started in a flying position. The body is kept straight with the arms extended to the side, and the regular dive position is assumed at about half the dive.\n\nDifficulty is rated according to the Degree of Difficulty of the dives. Some divers may find pike easier in a flip than tuck, and most find straight the easiest in a front/back dive, although it is still rated the most difficult because of the risk of overrotation.\n\nAn armstand dive may have a higher degree of difficulty outdoors compared to indoors as wind can destabilize the equilibrium of the diver.\n\nIn competition, the dives are referred to by a schematic system of three- or four-digit numbers. The letter to indicate the position is appended to the end of the number.\n\nThe first digit of the number indicates the dive group as defined above.\n\nFor groups 1 to 4, the number consists of three digits and a letter of the alphabet. The third digit represents the number of half-somersaults. The second digit is either 0 or 1, with 0 representing a normal somersault, and 1 signifying a \"flying\" variation of the basic movement (i.e. the first half somersault is performed in the straight position, and then the pike or tuck shape is assumed). No flying dive has been competed at a high level competition for many years.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor Group 5, the dive number has 4 digits. The first digit indicates that it is a twisting dive. The second digit indicates the group (1–4) of the underlying movement; the third digit indicates the number of half-somersaults, and the fourth indicates the number of half-twists.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor Group 6 – Armstand – the dive number has either three or four digits: Three digits for dives without twist and four for dives with twists.\n\nIn non-twisting armstand dives, the second digit indicates the direction of rotation (0 = no rotation, 1 = forward, 2 = backward, 3 = reverse, 4 = inward) and the third digit indicates the number of half-somersaults. Inward-rotating armstand dives have never been performed, and are generally regarded as physically impossible.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor twisting Armstand dives, the dive number again has 4 digits, but rather than beginning with the number 5, the number 6 remains as the first digit, indicating that the \"twister\" will be performed from an Armstand. The second digit indicates the direction of rotation – as above, the third is the number of half-somersaults, and the fourth is the number of half-twists:\n\ne.g. 6243D – armstand back double-somersault with one and a half twists in the free position\n\nAll of these dives come with DD (degree of difficulty) this is an indication of how difficult/complex a dive is. The score that the dive receives is multiplied by the DD (also known as tariff) to give the dive a final score. Before a diver competes they must decide on a \"list\" this is a number of optional dives and compulsory dives. The optionals come with a DD limit. this means that a diver must select X number of dives and the combined DD limit must be no more than the limit set by the competition/organisation etc.\n\nUntil the mid-1990s the tariff was decided by the FINA diving committee, and divers could only select from the range of dives in the published tariff table. Since then, the tariff is calculated by a formula based on various factors such as the number of twist and somersaults, the height, the group etc., and divers are free to submit new combinations. This change was implemented because new dives were being invented too frequently for an annual meeting to accommodate the progress of the sport.\n\nAt the moment of take-off, two critical aspects of the dive are determined, and cannot subsequently be altered during the execution. One is the trajectory of the dive, and the other is the magnitude of the angular momentum.\n\nThe speed of rotation – and therefore the total amount of rotation – may be varied from moment to moment by changing the shape of the body, in accordance with the law of conservation of angular momentum.\n\nThe center of mass of the diver follows a parabolic path in free-fall under the influence of gravity (ignoring the effects of air resistance, which are negligible at the speeds involved).\n\nSince the parabola is symmetrical, the travel away from the board as the diver passes it is twice the amount of the forward travel at the peak of the flight. Excessive forward distance to the entry point is penalized when scoring a dive, but obviously an adequate clearance from the diving board is essential on safety grounds.\n\nThe greatest possible height that can be achieved is desirable for several reasons:\n\n\nThe magnitude of angular momentum remains constant throughout the dive, but since\n\nand the moment of inertia is larger when the body has an increased radius, the speed of rotation may be increased by moving the body into a compact shape, and reduced by opening out into a straight position.\n\nSince the tucked shape is the most compact, it gives the most control over rotational speed, and dives in this position are easier to perform. Dives in the straight position are hardest, since there is almost no scope for altering the speed, so the angular momentum must be created at take-off with a very high degree of accuracy. (A small amount of control is available by moving the position of the arms and by a slight hollowing of the back).\n\nThe opening of the body for the entry does not stop the rotation, but merely slows it down. The vertical entry achieved by expert divers is largely an illusion created by starting the entry slightly short of vertical, so that the legs are vertical as they disappear beneath the surface. A small amount of additional tuning is available by 'entry save' techniques, whereby underwater movements of the upper body and arms against the viscosity of the water affect the position of the legs.\n\nDives with multiple twists and somersaults are some of the most spectacular movements, as well as the most challenging to perform.\n\nThe rules state that twisting 'must not be generated manifestly on take-off'. Consequently, divers must use some of the somersaulting angular momentum to generate twisting movements. The physics of twisting can be explained by looking at the components of the angular momentum vector.\n\nAs the diver leaves the board, the total angular momentum vector is horizontal, pointing directly to the left for a forward dive for example. For twisting rotation to exist, it is necessary to tilt the body sideways after takeoff, so that there is now a small component of this horizontal angular momentum vector along the body's long axis. The tilt can be seen in the photo.\n\nThe tilting is done by the arms, which are outstretched to the sides just before the twist. When one arm is moved up and the other is moved down (like turning a big steering wheel), the body reacts by tilting to the side, which then begins the twisting rotation. At the completion of the required number of twist rotations, the arm motion is reversed (the steering wheel is turned back), which removes the body's tilt and stops the twisting rotation.\n\nAn alternative explanation is that the moving arms have precession torque on them which set the body into twisting rotation. Moving the arms back produces opposite torque which stops the twisting rotation.\n\nThe rules state that the body should be vertical, or nearly so, for entry. Strictly speaking, it is physically impossible to achieve a literally vertical position throughout the entry as there will inevitably still be some rotational momentum while the body is entering the water. Divers therefore attempt to create the illusion of being vertical, especially when performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements. For back entries, one technique is to allow the upper body to enter slightly short of vertical so that the continuing rotation leaves the final impression of the legs entering vertically. This is called \"Pike save\". Another is to use \"knee save\" movements of scooping the upper body underwater in the direction of rotation so as to counteract the rotation of the legs.\n\nThe arms must be beside the body for feet-first dives, which are typically competed only on the 1m springboard and only at fairly low levels of 3m springboard, and extended forwards in line for \"head-first\" dives, which are much more common competitively. It used to be common for the hands to be interlocked with the fingers extended towards the water, but a different technique has become favoured during the last few decades. Now the usual practice is for one hand to grasp the other with palms down to strike the water with a flat surface. This creates a vacuum between the hands, arms and head which, with a vertical entry, will pull down and under any splash until deep enough to have minimal effect on the surface of the water (the so-called \"rip entry\").\n\nOnce a diver is completely under the water they may choose to roll or scoop in the same direction their dive was rotating to pull their legs into a more vertical position. Apart from aesthetic considerations, it is important from a safety point of view that divers reinforce the habit of rolling in the direction of rotation, especially for forward and inward entries. Back injuries hyperextention are caused by attempting to re-surface in the opposite direction. Diving from the higher levels increases the danger and likelihood of such injuries.\n\nIn Canada, elite competitive diving is regulated by DPC (Diving Plongeon Canada), although the individual provinces also have organizational bodies. The main competitive season runs from February to July, although some competitions may be held in January or December, and many divers (particularly international level athletes) will train and compete year round.\n\nMost provincial level competitions consist of events for 6 age groups (Groups A, B, C, D, E, and Open) for both genders on each of the three board levels. These age groups roughly correspond to those standardized by FINA, with the addition of a youngest age group for divers 9 and younger, Group E, which does not compete nationally and does not have a tower event (although divers of this age may choose to compete in Group D). The age group Open is so called because divers of any age, including those over 18, may compete in these events, so long as their dives meet a minimum standard of difficulty.\n\nAlthough Canada is internationally a fairly strong country in diving, the vast majority of Canadian high schools and universities do not have diving teams, and many Canadian divers accept athletic scholarships from American colleges.\n\nAdult divers who are not competitive at an elite level may compete in masters diving. Typically, masters are either adults who never practiced the sport as children or teenagers, or former elite athletes who have retired but still seek a way to be involved in the sport. Many diving clubs have masters teams in addition to their primary competitive ones, and while some masters dive only for fun and fitness, there are also masters competitions, which range from the local to world championship level.\n\nDivers can qualify to compete at the age group national championships, or junior national championships, in their age groups as assigned by FINA up to the age of 18. This competition is held annually in July. Qualification is based on achieving minimum scores at earlier competitions in the season, although athletes who place very highly at a national championship will be automatically qualified to compete at the next. Divers must qualify at two different competitions, at least one of which must be a level 1 competition, i.e. a competition with fairly strict judging patterns. Such competitions include the Polar Bear Invitational in Winnipeg, the Sting in Victoria, and the Alberta Provincial Championships in Edmonton or Calgary. The qualifying scores are determined by DPC according to the results of the preceding year's national competition, and typically do not have much variation from year to year.\n\nDivers older than 18, or advanced divers of younger ages, can qualify for the senior national championships, which are held twice each year, once roughly in March and once in June or July. Once again, qualification is based on achieving minimum scores at earlier competitions (in this case, within the 12 months preceding the national championships, and in an Open age group event), or high placements in previous national championships or international competitions. It is no longer the case that divers may use results from age group events to qualify for senior nationals, or results from Open events to qualify for age group nationals.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland facilities are limited to one pool at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin.\n\nNational championships take place late in the year, usually during November. The competition is held at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin and consists of four events:\n\nIn the United Kingdom, diving competitions on all boards run throughout the year. National Masters' Championships are held two or three times per year.\n\nIn the United States, summer diving is usually limited to one meter diving at community or country club pools. Some pools organize to form intra-pool competitions. These competitions are usually designed to accommodate all school-age children. One of the largest and oldest summer leagues in the United States is found in the Northern Virginia area where teams from 47 pools compete against each other every summer. NVSL-Dive annually holds the Wally Martin 3-Meter Championship and concludes the season with its Individual All Stars Championship. In addition, NVSL-Dive annually hosts the largest one-day dive meet in the world, with over 350 developmental divers in NVSL's \"Cracker Jack\" Invitational! Champions from each of these events have gone on to compete at the collegiate and Olympic levels.\n\nIn the United States scholastic diving at the high school level is usually limited to one meter diving (but some schools use three meter springboards.). Scores from those one meter dives contribute to the swim team's overall score. High school diving and swimming concludes their season with a state competition. Depending on the state and the number of athletes competing in the state, certain qualifications must be achieved to compete in the state's championship meet. There are often regional championships and district championships which are necessary to compete in before reaching the state meet to narrow the field to only the most competitive athletes. Most state championship meets consist of eleven dives. The eleven dives are usually split up between two categories: five required (voluntary) dives and six optional dives.\n\nIn the United States, pre-college divers interested in learning one and three meter or platform diving should consider a club sanctioned by either USA Diving or AAU Diving. In USA Diving, Future Champions is the entry level or novice diver category with 8 levels of competition. From Future Champions, divers graduate to \"Junior Olympic\", or JO. JO divers compete in age groups at inter-club competitions, at invitationals, and if qualified, at regional, zone and national competitions. Divers over the age of 19 years of age cannot compete in these events as a JO diver.\n\nUSA Diving sanctions the Winter Nationals championship with one, three meter, and platform events. In the summer USA Diving sanctions the Summer Nationals including all three events with both Junior and Senior divers. USA Diving is sanctioned by the United States Olympic Committee to select team representatives for international diving competitions including the World Championships and Olympic Games.\n\nAAU Diving sanctions one national event per year in the summer. AAU competes on the one, three, and tower to determine the All-American team.\n\nIn the United States scholastic diving at the college level requires one and three meter diving. Scores from the one and three meter competition contribute to the swim team's overall meet score. College divers interested in tower diving may compete in the NCAA separate from swim team events. NCAA Divisions II and III do not usually compete platform; if a diver wishes to compete platform in college, he or she must attend a Division I school.\n\nEach division also has rules on the number of dives in each competition. Division II schools compete with 10 dives in competition whereas Division III schools compete with 11. Division I schools only compete with 6 dives in competition. These 6 dives consist of either 5 optionals and 1 voluntary, or 6 optionals. If the meet is a 5 optional meet, then the divers will perform 1 optional from each category (Front, Back, Inward, Reverse, and Twister) and then 1 voluntary from the category of their choice. The voluntary in this type of meet is always worth a DD (Degree of Difficulty) of 2.0 even if the real DD is worth more or less on a DD sheet. In a 6 optional meet, the divers will yet again perform one dive from each category, but this time they will perform a 6th optional from the category of their choosing, which is worth its actual DD from the DD sheet.\n\nThe highest level of collegiate competition is the NCAA Division 1 Swimming and Diving Championship. Events at the championship include 1 meter springboard, 3 meter springboard, and platform, as well as various swimming individual and relay events. The points scored by swimmers and divers are combined to determine a team swimming & diving champion. To qualify for a diving event at the NCAA championships, a competitor must first finish in the top three at one of five zone championships, which are held after the various conference championship meets. A diver who scores at least 310 points on the 3 meter springboard and 300 points on the 1 meter springboard in a 6 optional meet can participate in the particular zone championship corresponding to the geographic region in which his or her school lies.\n\nA number of colleges and universities offer scholarships to men and women who have competitive diving skills. These scholarships are usually offered to divers with age-group or club diving experience.\n\nThe NCAA limits the number of years a college student can represent any school in competitions. The limit is four years, but could be less under certain circumstances.\n\nDivers who continue diving past their college years can compete in Masters' Diving programs. Masters' diving programs are frequently offered by college or club programs.\n\nMasters' Diving events are normally conducted in age-groups separated by five or ten years, and attract competitors of a wide range of ages and experience (many, indeed, are newcomers to the sport); the oldest competitor in a Masters' Diving Championship was Viola Krahn, who at the age of 101 was the first person in any sport, male or female, anywhere in the world, to compete in an age-group of 100+ years in a nationally organized competition.\n\n\nDiving is also popular as a non-competitive activity. Such diving usually emphasizes the airborne experience, and the height of the dive, but does not emphasize what goes on once the diver enters the water. The ability to dive underwater can be a useful emergency skill, and is an important part of watersport and navy safety training. Entering water from a height is an enjoyable leisure activity, as is underwater swimming.\n\nSuch non-competitive diving can occur indoors and outdoors. Outdoor diving typically takes place from cliffs or other rock formations either into fresh or salt water. However, man-made diving platforms are sometimes constructed in popular swimming destinations. Outdoor diving requires knowledge of the water depth and currents as conditions can be dangerous.\nOn occasion, the diver will inadvertently belly flop, entering the water horizontally or nearly so. The diver typically displaces a larger than usual amount of water.\n\nA recently developing section of the sport is \"High Diving\" (e.g. see 2013 World Aquatics Championships), conducted in open air locations, usually from improvised platforms up to high (as compared with as used in Olympic and World Championship events). Entry to the water is invariably feet-first to avoid the risk of injury that would be involved in head-first entry from that height. The final half-somersault is almost always performed backwards, enabling the diver to spot the entry point and control their rotation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2553923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2553923", "title": "Grand final", "text": "Grand final\n\nA grand final is a game that decides a sports league's championship (or premiership) winning team, i.e. the conclusive game of a finals (or play-off) series. Synonymous with a championship game in North American sports, grand finals have become a significant part of Australian culture. The earliest competitions to feature a grand final were Australia's AFL (Australian rules football) and NRL (rugby league football). They influenced other competitions such as soccer's A-League, the National Basketball League, netball's Suncorp Super Netball and European rugby league's Super League to adopt grand finals as well. Most grand finals involve a prestigious award for the player voted best on field.\n\nThe Anglo-Norman term \"grand\" to describe a sporting event, documented in England as \"grand match\" in 1836, was used in Australia from the 1850s. A steeplechase in England has been called the \"Grand National Steeple Chase\" (\"Grand National\" alone for short) since at least 1839.\n\nUse of the term in Australian Football dates back to the first organised and widely publicised match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College on 7 August 1858 at Yarra Park, Melbourne (formerly Richmond Park). The game was advertised as the \"grand football match\" in the Melbourne Morning Herald and several other local newspapers.\n\nIn 1859, a \"grand football match\" was advertised in Richmond, Tasmania for St Patrick's Day on Friday 18 March.\n\nIn \"The Argus\" of 1861, the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne invited clubs to compete in a \"grand football-match\" which was to be football's first ever trophy, the Caledonian Challenge Cup, however the match did not proceed until the following year.\n\nThe earliest known event described as \"grand\" in Sydney was a cricket match in 1862.\n\nIn the 1871 South Yarra Challenge Cup, Carlton and Melbourne drew their three matches, but also won their remaining matches (against Albert Park and South Yarra). As head-to-head record was the only tiebreaker at that time, the team captains and the Cup organisers arranged a \"grand match\", as advertised in \"The Argus\" to decide the premiership. Carlton won by two goals to nil.\n\nInitially, a football premiership final appeared to be called a \"grand final\" only when the losers of a final were the minor premiers and they exercised the \"right to challenge\" the winners to a second premiership decider.\n\nPrior to 1898, the South Australian Football Association (SAFA, now SANFL) was awarded to the team that finished top of the end-of-season ladder placings.\n\nIn 1889, Norwood and Port Adelaide finished equal first, meaning a play off match was required to determine the premiers. In promoting the decider match, local press referred to the match as a \"premiership match\". This was played on October 5, and Norwood won the match 7.4 to 5.9.\n\nIn 1894, Norwood and South Adelaide finished with a 13-5 record from their 18 matches. The match was fixed for October 6, and despite a provision for 20 minute periods of extra time in the event of a draw at full time, the match was abandoned due to darkness with the scores level at 4.8 apiece.\n\nThe SAFA fixed a replay for October 10, Labor Day: this was the first of seven grand final replays in elite Australian football history.\nNorwood won the replay 4.7 to South Adelaide 3.5 with a goal from Bos Daly as the final bell rang.\n\nIn the Victorian Football Association, which was Victoria's top level of senior football from 1877 until 1896, the premiership was typically awarded solely on the basis of the rostered premiership matches (known today as the home-and-away season). However, the rules stipulated that where two or more teams finished equal on premiership points, a playoff match or matches would be scheduled amongst those teams to determine the premiers.\n\nThis was required in 1896, when and finished level on top of the ladder with records of 14 wins and one draw. The playoff match between them, which is retrospectively treated as Victoria's first Grand Final, was won by Collingwood 6.9 – 5.10.\n\nThere was one previous premiership playoff match during this time in the VFA between and in 1878, but this match did not break a tie at the top of the ladder, as Geelong already had a better win-loss record than Melbourne: the match was organized by the VFA to resolve a dispute between the two clubs.\n\nIn 1897, when eight teams broke away from the VFA to form the VFL, the concept of finals football was high on the agenda, with teams buoyed by the success and attendances of the 1896 Grand Final. Over the following ten years, all top-level Australian football leagues adopted a finals structure.\n\nIn 1931 the VFL adopted a system, the Page–McIntyre system, which ensured a grand final, and the concept became entrenched.\n\nThe New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) experimented with a finals system in 1908, its inaugural year, but abandoned it the following season. Finals were reintroduced in 1926, and the premiership decider appeared to only be called a \"grand final\" if it involved the minor premiers.\n\nBy the 1930s, the NSWRFL adopted the term \"grand final\" to describe the premiership decider.\nUp until 1954 a 'grand final' match was only held if the minor premiers were beaten. The adoption of the VFL's Page–McIntyre system for the 1954 NSWRFL season meant for the first time grand finals would become necessary every season, so the term grand final has become used to describe all premiership deciders.\n\nThe tradition is maintained by the present-day NRL National Rugby League.\n\nThe term \"Grand Final\" was introduced to Europe in 1995 in a completely different sport—golf. In that year, the Challenge Tour, the official developmental tour for the European Tour, launched its season-ending Challenge Tour Grand Final. British rugby league would adopt the term in 1998, two years after the start of Super League. The Super League Grand Final has now become an accepted part of the British scene, and the term 'grand final' is used to describe the final of leagues below Super League as well, such as the Championship, Championship 1 and the Conference. Prior to this, a \"Championship Final\" was introduced to determine the winner of the British Rugby Football League Championship in 1904, though it only became a regular fixture from 1906 onwards. In 1973, the competition format was changed so that the championship was won by the team finishing top of the league table, with an end of season knock-out competition for the top teams that became known as the \"Premiership\" being created.\n\nStarting in 2009–10, the rugby union competition historically known as the Celtic League, at the time involving teams from Ireland, Scotland and Wales, introduced a playoff system to determine its champion. (Although the league conducted a knockout competition in its early years, it was a parallel cup competition instead of a championship tournament.) The final match was branded as a grand final. This usage continued for the 2010–11 season, the first that included teams from Italy. Starting with the 2011–12 season, the first under the current sponsored name of RaboDirect Pro12, the \"Grand Final\" terminology was scrapped; the final match is now simply called the \"Final\".\n\n\nA grand final replay is a method of deciding the winner of a competition when a grand final is drawn by replaying the entire match the following week, rather than playing overtime or extra time on the same day. It is commonly used in Australian rules football and most notably in the Australian Football League, where it has been used three times, most recently in 2010, however the AFL decided that replays will no longer decide grand finals that end as a draw, rather replacing it with extra time.\n\nMost sports leagues in Australia have a grand final breakfast to mark the beginning to grand final day. It is a social highlight on the Australian sporting calendar. Watching the event is a ritual for many footy fans and the function plays a huge role in the pre match build up for the grand final. The North Melbourne Football Club host the North Melbourne Grand Final Breakfast and the National Rugby League host the NRL Grand Final Breakfast at Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre in Darling Harbour normally. Messenger Premier League also have a grand final breakfast.\n\n\n\n"}

When built in 1928, it was the largest basketball arena in the United States, a distinction it retained until 1950. It is the sixth-oldest college basketball arena still in use, and it is a U.S. National Historic Landmark. It is among the earliest of the major college fieldhouses, which, along with rules changes that made for a faster game, transformed college basketball in the late 1920s and 1930s.\n\nHinkle Fieldhouse is nicknamed \"Indiana's Basketball Cathedral\" due to the rich history it has played in the development of basketball in Indiana, also to distinguish it from The Palestra, known as \"The Cathedral of College Basketball.\"\n\nHinkle Fieldhouse and the 36,000-seat Butler Bowl football stadium were two of the first buildings erected when the university moved to the Fairview campus. The facilities were promoted by a corporation of 41 Indianapolis businessmen who viewed it as a prize for the city as well as for Butler. When Butler signed a lease with the Indiana High School Athletic Association to host the high school state tournament, the corporation agreed to finance the building at a cost of $1,000,000.\n\nIn 1933, the interior was reconfigured, moving the court from an east-west orientation to a north-south position. In the initial arrangement, over half of the seats were at the ends of the court, while event viewing is typically better from the sides. Butler hosted the high school tourney from 1928 to 1971, except for 1943–1945, when the building housed the US Army Air Forces and US Navy as a barracks during World War II.\n\nHinkle Fieldhouse hosted the annual state high school basketball championship games, including the \"Milan Miracle\", the memorable 1954 victory of tiny Milan High School over the much larger Muncie Central High School. The film \"Hoosiers\" is loosely based on that event and used Hinkle Fieldhouse and the memorable voices of original announcers Hilliard Gates and Tom Carnegie in filming the climactic game of the popular movie. Ralph Underwood was the radio announcer. With the exception of an occasional high school showcase, high school basketball games are rarely contested at Hinkle Fieldhouse any more, and Indiana High School Athletic Association state basketball tournament games are played elsewhere.\n\nA major $1.5 million facelift in 1989 reduced the seating capacity from 15,000 to 11,043, as well as renovating the main reception area, basketball offices, film rooms and team locker rooms. The other athletic and physical education offices, sports locker rooms, and fitness facilities at the fieldhouse were renovated as well in 1992. Hinkle Fieldhouse hosted the entire 1994 Horizon League men's basketball conference tournament as well as parts of the 2004, 2008, 2009, and 2010 Horizon League tournaments.\n\nThe fieldhouse was originally called Butler Fieldhouse, but was renamed in 1966 to honor Paul D. \"Tony\" Hinkle (1899–1992), who was basketball coach at Butler for 41 seasons ending in 1970. In 1983, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and on February 27, 1987, it was designated as a National Historic Landmark in recognition of its role in transforming college basketball. It also inspired the design of Bankers Life Fieldhouse.\n\nIn 2006, to celebrate Butler University's 150th anniversary, a documentary about Hinkle Fieldhouse aired on ESPN entitled \"Indiana's Basketball Cathedral\".\n\nIn 2011, Butler University began the first phase of a renovation and restoration project. Capacity has been cut from 10,000 to 9,100. The gym that once held bleachers now has about 4,500 chair back seats and handrails line the aisles. That includes nearly all of the lower two levels except for some bleachers reserved for student seating. Small scoreboards occupy each of the four corners in addition to the main video board above midcourt.\n\nA pool was attached to the west end of Hinkle, but the university closed it in 2002 due to the high maintenance costs. The athletic department had been using it since then as a storage area. During the renovation, the pool was converted into a three-level facility that includes a workout room on the first level, an academic center and a training facility on the second floor that is six times larger than the previous training facility, and Butler's athletic administrative offices and coaches' offices on the top level.\n\nThe men's and women's basketball offices are adjacent to their respective locker rooms just off the Hinkle floor, but they have been upgraded. The men's basketball locker room has been expanded and Butler has a separate video room for the first time. Former Butler standout and current Boston Celtics player Gordon Hayward donated the funds for the renovation.\n\n\"The scoreboards on the side are new, but it still has a historic feel,\" Butler senior guard Alex Barlow said. \"It still has a lot of modern upgrades that fans like to see. If you see the locker room and the weight room and the training room, it's come a long way since I've gotten here.\"\n\nThe Bulldogs still play on the original floor, which has been used longer than any playing surface in Division I.\n\nThe Fieldhouse has hosted to U.S. presidents (Herbert Hoover, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton), Evangelist Billy Graham, ice shows, professional basketball teams, Olympic basketball trials, the first USSR-USA basketball game, all-star basketball games for the NBA, ABA and the East-West College All-Stars, national indoor track events, tennis matches of both Bill Tilden and Jack Kramer, national equestrian events, the roller derby, a six-day bicycle race, a three ring circus, as well as the volleyball matches during the 1987 Pan American Games. The 1940 NCAA Basketball Tournament East Regionals were held there, won by the eventual national champion Indiana Hoosiers. Until 1978, those games were the only NCAA tournament games held within the city. With 15,000 spectators, the volleyball match was the highest-attended volleyball match ever held in the United States.\n\n\n\n"}

Loan deals may last from a few weeks to all season-long and can persist for multiple seasons.\n\nPlayers may be loaned out to other clubs for several reasons. Most commonly, young prospects will be loaned to a club in a lower league in order to gain valuable first team experience. In this instance, the parent club may continue to pay the player's wages in full or in part. Some clubs put a formal arrangement in place with a feeder club for this purpose, such as Manchester United and Royal Antwerp, Arsenal and Beveren, or Chelsea and Vitesse. In other leagues such as Italy's Serie A, some smaller clubs have a reputation as a \"farm club\" and regularly take players, especially younger players, on loan from larger clubs.\n\nA club may take a player on loan if they are short on transfer funds but can still pay wages, or as temporary cover for injuries or suspensions. The parent club might demand a fee or that the loaning club pays some or all of the player's wages during the loan period. A club might seek to loan out a squad player to make a saving on his wages, or a first team player to regain match fitness following an injury.\n\nA loan may be made to get around a transfer window. Such a loan might include an agreed fee for a permanent transfer when the next transfer window opens.\n\nSome players are loaned because they are unhappy or in dispute with their current club and no other club wishes to buy them permanently. Examples of this situation include Henri Camara with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Craig Bellamy with Newcastle United, and Darren Bent with Aston Villa.\n\nIn the Premier League, players on loan are not permitted to play against the team which holds their registration (section 7.2 of rule M.6). Loanees are, however, allowed to play against their 'owning' clubs in cup competitions, unless they have played for their owning club in that cup during that season.\n\nIn the Scottish Professional Football League (and previously the Scottish Football League), clubs are permitted to take players on as unpaid trialists even for competitive fixtures. Sometimes for the first two weeks of a trial period players' names are obfuscated; match reports use the convention \"A Trialist\" to refer to such players in lieu of using their real names.\n\n"}

As a result, Visa came up with an advertising campaign to feature four men who have attended every Super Bowl since the first one in 1967. The four men were New England Patriots fan Don Crisman, San Francisco 49ers fan Larry Jacobson, Pittsburgh Steelers fan Thomas Henschel, and Green Bay Packers fan Robert Cook. The commercial itself featured the four men holding up tickets for 44 years of Super Bowls. At one point, there were five members, but one became immobile after turning 80.

However, so the story goes, John Willes became the first bowler to use a \"round-arm\" technique after practising with his sister Christine Willes, who had used the technique, as she was unable to bowl underarm due to her wide and huge skirt impeding her delivery of the ball.\n\nA roundarm delivery is where the hand is between shoulder height and waist height;\n\nAfter roundarm was legalised in 1835 with the bowler allowed to deliver the ball at shoulder height, it was not long before some bowlers began to raise the hand above the shoulder. The Laws of Cricket at that time directed that such a delivery be called a no-ball. In 1845, the law was strengthened by removing the benefit of doubt from the bowler in height of hand questions, the umpire's view of the incident being final.\n\nEven so, it was only a matter of time before confrontation occurred. The problem was that many umpires were themselves bowlers and believed that the bowler should be allowed to bowl with a fully raised hand. The watershed was reached on 26 August 1862 at The Oval when Surrey hosted All-England. The England bowler Edgar Willsher deliberately bowled overarm and was no-balled six times in succession by umpire John Lillywhite, ironically the son of William Lillywhite, the famous bowler who had done so much to have roundarm legalised in 1835.\n\nIn what was surely a pre-rehearsed demonstration, Willsher and the other eight professionals in the England team staged a walk-off, leaving their two amateur colleagues looking non-plussed in the middle. Play continued next day, but Lillywhite diplomatically withdrew and was replaced by another umpire.\n\nMCC responded to this \"crisis\" with rather more haste than they had to roundarm and changed the Laws of Cricket in time for the 1864 season. Law 10 was rewritten to allow the bowler to bring his arm through at any height providing he kept it straight and did not throw the ball. This completed the evolution of bowling and the overarm style has remained predominant ever since, though some conservatives (including W G Grace, no less) did continue to bowl roundarm till the end of their careers; and even underarm itself was still seen occasionally.\n\nAn interesting historical development of the legalisation of overarm was that for many years, 1864 was deemed to mark the start of \"first-class cricket\" which suggested that earlier cricket was \"second-class\". The 1864 origin has been strongly challenged: \"see also\" First-class cricket.\n\n\n"}

They have also recently started making fan gear such as chairs, tents, and bags with team logos on them.\n\nThe Horween Leather Company has provided Rawlings with leather since 1929. In 2003, Horween was providing leather for 3,000 Rawlings baseball gloves annually, and half of professional baseball players were using baseball gloves made from Horween leather.\n\nRawlings is the most chosen glove of current Major League Baseball players.\n\nRawlings was founded in Saint Louis in 1887, during the middle of the Long Depression, by George and Alfred Rawlings. The brothers set up a sporting goods store with its own catalog. They sold \"Fishing Tackle, Guns, Baseball, Football, Golf, Polo, Tennis, Athletic and General Sporting Goods\".\n\nThe company is credited with introducing football shoulder pads in 1902, and the first all-weather football.\n\nRawlings began providing the hometown St. Louis Cardinals with gloves in 1906.\n\nIn , Bill Doak, a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals, suggested that a web be placed between the first finger and the thumb in order to create a pocket. This design soon became the standard for baseball gloves. Doak patented his design and sold it to Rawlings. His design became the precursor to modern gloves, and enabled Rawlings to become the preferred glove of professional players.\n\nIn 1955 Spalding bought Rawlings, and began using it to manufacture baseballs.\n\nIn 1957 the company introduced the Gold Glove award, which became the major award for baseball. It also sponsors the Minor League Baseball (MiLB) \"Rawlings Woman Executive of the Year\" award.\n\n13 years after acquiring it, an anti-trust investigation forced Spalding to sell Rawlings again, but as it did so Spalding set up a contract that would have Rawlings manufacture baseballs to sell with the Spalding logo.\n\nWhen this agreement ended in 1977, Rawlings began using its own logo, becoming the official supplier of the major leagues (producing separate balls for both the American and National Leagues from 1977 to 1999, and since 2000, a single ball for all of Major League Baseball), succeeding Spalding, which had been the supplier for a century. All the balls supplied to the major and minor leagues are manufactured in Costa Rica. Additional low-end versions are manufactured in China.\n\nMany major leaguers have endorsed Rawlings equipment over the years. There are four main series for the gloves: the Gold Glove Series, the Heritage Pro Series, the Heart of the Hide Series, the Pro Preferred Series and the Gold Glove Collection Series.\n\nIn 2003, K2 Inc. acquired Rawlings. In 2005 Rawlings corporate headquarters were moved from Fenton, Missouri, to Town and Country, Missouri. In 2007, Jarden acquired K2 Inc. On December 14, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Jarden for over $15 billion of cash and stock. The combined company was renamed Newell Brands.\n\nIt was announced on June 5, 2018 that Rawlings was sold from Newell Brands to the Los Angeles-based private equity firm, Seidler Equity Partners (SEP) (which owns LA Fitness), with MLB a co-investor in the $395 million deal. Rawlings employs 150 people in the St. Louis area, and 1,200 globally. The deal was completed on July 2, 2018. Rawlings previously made some custom baseball gloves at its plant in Washington, Missouri, but no longer makes any baseball gloves in the United States, with the factory still open.\n\nRawlings currently sponsors numerous collegiate baseball teams in the NCAA.

The film received generally negative reviews by the time of its release; it was criticized for its storyline, characters, dialogue, and critics were mixed with the use of special effects, but received praise for its capacity to entertain the target audience and the performance of its cast. Years later, however, the film received more praise, with some commentators calling it an \"underrated\" film.\n\nSpeed Racer is an 18-year-old whose life and love has always been automobile racing. His parents--Pops and Mom--run the independent Racer Motors, in which his brother Spritle and his pet monkey Chim Chim, his mechanic Sparky, and his girlfriend Trixie are also involved. As a child, Speed idolized his record-setting older brother, Rex Racer. When Rex and Pops had a falling out, Rex ran away to race for other companies and gained a reputation for being a dirty racer and disgraced his family. Rex was apparently killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000 (AKA The Crucible) a deadly cross-country racing rally. Now embarking on his own career, Speed is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill behind the wheel of his brother's Mach 5 and his own T-180 car, the Mach 6, although he is primarily interested in the art of the race and the well-being of his family.\n\nE.P. Arnold Royalton, owner of conglomerate Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle in exchange for signing to race with him. Though tempted, Speed declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years, key races have been fixed by corporate interests, including himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of an intelligence agency's corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn supposedly has evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000, which could also substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.\n\nAfter they drive together and work naturally as a team, Speed begins to suspect that Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With the help of his family and Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers, who were bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race, while Detector's team arrests Block. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family's company to profit from Royalton's buyout. Enraged, Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead, but encourages Speed not to let what had transpired change his idea of racing. Speed plans to leave to clear his mind but returns home where he is confronted by Pops. Pops does not prevent Speed from leaving as he is proud of Speed for his cause despite it being in vain, and acknowledges that it was his own stubbornness that drove his son Rex away. Taejo's sister Horuko arrives and gives him Taejo's rejected automatic invitation to the Grand Prix. The Racer family bands together and builds a new Mach 6 in 32 hours.\n\nSpeed enters the Grand Prix against great odds; Royalton has placed a $1,000,000 bounty on his head that the other drivers are eager to collect, and he is pitted against future Hall of Fame driver Jack \"Cannonball\" Taylor. Speed overcomes a slow start to catch up with Taylor, who uses a cheating device called a spearhook to latch the Mach 6 to his own car. Speed uses his jump jacks to expose the device to video cameras, causing Taylor to crash. Speed wins the race, having successfully exposed Royalton's crimes. While Racer X watches it is revealed in a flashback montage that he is indeed Rex, who had faked his death by detonating a bomb in his car in the caves and underwent plastic surgery to change his appearance as part of his plan to protect Speed and the sport of racing. He chooses not to reveal his identity to his family, declaring that he must live with his decision. The Racer family celebrates Speed's victory as Speed and Trixie kiss, and Royalton is sent to jail.\n\nSeries originals Peter Fernandez and Corinne Orr appear as race announcers.\n\nIn September 1992, Joe Pytka announced that Warner Bros. held the option to create a live action film adaptation of the 1960s Japanese anime and manga series \"Speed Racer\", in development at Silver Pictures. In October 1994, singer Henry Rollins was offered the role of Racer X. In June 1995, Johnny Depp was cast into the lead role for \"Speed Racer\", with production slated to begin the coming October, with filming to take place in California and Arizona. The following August, Depp requested time off to the studio for personal business, delaying production. However, due to an overly high budget, the same August, director Julien Temple left the project. Depp, without a director, also departed from the project. The studio considered director Gus Van Sant as a replacement for Temple, though it would not grant writing privileges to Van Sant. In December 1997, the studio briefly hired Alfonso Cuarón as director. In the various incarnations of the project, screenwriters Marc Levin, Jennifer Flackett, J. J. Abrams, and Patrick Read Johnson had been hired to write scripts.\n\nIn September 2000, Warner Bros. and producer Lauren Shuler Donner hired writer-director Hype Williams to take the helm of the project. In October 2001, the studio hired screenwriters Christian Gudegast and Paul Scheuring for $1.2 million split between them to write a script for the film. Eventually, without production getting under way, the director and the writers left the project. In June 2004, Vince Vaughn spearheaded a revival of the project by presenting a take for the film that would develop the characters more strongly. Vaughn was cast as Racer X and was also attached to the project as an executive producer. With production never becoming active, Vaughn was eventually detached from the project.\n\nIn October 2006, The Wachowskis were brought on board by the studio to write and direct the film. Producer Joel Silver, who had collaborated with the Wachowskis for \"V for Vendetta\" and \"The Matrix\" Trilogy, explained that they were hoping to reach a broader audience with a film that would not be rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. Visual effects designer John Gaeta, who won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for the Wachowskis' \"The Matrix\", was brought in to help conceive making \"Speed Racer\" into a live-action adaptation. Production was set to begin in summer 2007 in European locations for a summer 2008 release. In November 2006, the release date for it was set for May 23, 2008. Producer Joel Silver described \"Speed Racer\" as a family film in line with the Wachowskis' goal to reach a wider audience.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt, Shia LaBeouf and Zac Efron were originally considered for the role of Speed Racer, Hirsch eventually won the role. Before Hirsch got prepared for the role, Hirsch watched every \"Speed Racer\" episode and visited Charlotte Motor Speedway (known as Lowe's Motor Speedway at the time), where he met with driver Jimmie Johnson. Elisha Cuthbert, Kate Mara and Rose McGowan were originally considered for the role of Trixie, the role was eventually given to Christina Ricci. Before Matthew Fox was cast as Racer X, Henry Rollins was originally considered for the role.\n\nIn February 2007, the Wachowskis selected Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam, Germany to film. In the following March, Warner Bros. moved the release date two weeks earlier to May 9, 2008. The studio received a grant of $12.3 million from Germany's new Federal Film Fund, the largest yet from the organization, for its production in the Berlin-Brandenburg region. The amount was later increased to $13 million. Principal photography commenced on June 5, 2007 in Berlin, and was shot entirely against greenscreen, lasting 60 days. The Wachowskis filmed in high-definition video for the first time. With the camera, the Wachowskis used a layering approach that would put both the foreground and the background in focus to give it the appearance of real-life anime. The film has a \"retro future\" look, according to Silver. Filming concluded on August 25, 2007.\n\nIn 2007, the Wachowskis purchased the rights to the sound effects and theme song of the television series for use in the film. The film's soundtrack was composed by Michael Giacchino, performed by Hollywood Studio Symphony and released by Varèse Sarabande. It was used along with orchestral score; Warner Bros. added an updated version of the \"Go, Speed Racer, Go\" theme song, which plays during the end credits, and was produced by Ali Dee Theodore and Jason Gleed, and performed by Ali Dee and the Deekompressors. Razor & Tie released this version was as a extended play on January 1, 2008 to promote the film's release, and as a single released along with film's soundtrack on May 6, 2008.\n\nDuring its production, animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) made allegations of animal cruelty against the film, reporting that one of the two chimpanzees used in the production was allegedly beaten after biting an actor. The incident was confirmed by the American Humane Association (AHA) Animal Safety Representative on the set, who reported that the stand-in for the Spritle character portrayed by Litt had been bitten without provocation. The AHA representative also reported that \"toward the end of filming, during a training session in the presence of the American Humane Representative, the trainer, in an uncontrolled impulse, hit the chimpanzee.\" The AHA Film Unit referred to this abuse as \"completely inexcusable and unacceptable behavior in the use of any animal.\" The AHA has rated \"Speed Racer\" \"Unacceptable\" chiefly because of this incident, with AHA noting \"the aforementioned training incident tarnishes the excellent work of the rest of production\" and that it \"has no method of separating the actions of one individual in the employ of a production from the production as a whole.\"\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" estimated that nearly 5,000 \"Speed Racer\" film-related products were licensed by Warner Bros. The film was backed by multiple promotional partners with over $80 million in marketing support. The partners include General Mills, McDonald's, Target, Topps, Esurance, Mattel, Lego, and Petrobras. The film also received support from companies outside of America in an attempt to attract international audiences. With early support before the film's release, the studio provided 3D computer models of the \"Speed Racer\" vehicle Mach 5 to the companies so they could accurately render the vehicle in their merchandise.\n\nMattel produced toys based on the film through several divisions. Hot Wheels produced die-cast vehicles, race sets and track sets. Tyco produced remote-controlled Mach 5s and racing sets. Radica Games produced video games in which players can use a car wheel. The products became available in March 2008. Also, the Lego Company produced four Lego sets based on the movie. As part of the General Mills promotional tie-in, during the 2008 Crown Royal Presents the Dan Lowry 400, part of the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup season, the famous #43 Dodge Charger of Petty Enterprises was transformed into a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series version of the Mach 5, driven by Bobby Labonte.\n\nWarner Bros., through its Interactive Entertainment division, self-published a video game based on \"Speed Racer\", which was released on May 6, 2008 on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii, and was released on September 16, 2008 for the PlayStation 2. The for the \"Speed Racer\" video game was written by Winifred Phillips and produced by Winnie Waldron. The game was released on the Nintendo DS and Wii in May with the film's theatrical release and was released on the PS2 in the fall to accompany the film's DVD and Blu-ray release. Due to a short development schedule, the studio chose not to develop games for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\n\"Speed Racer\" premiered on April 26, 2008 during a $500,000-estimated event at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles, where 4,000 people attended. It was released in regular theaters on May 9, 2008, grossing $18,561,337 in its opening weekend from around 6,700 screens at 3,606 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking third at the box office behind \"Iron Man\" and \"What Happens in Vegas\". In its second weekend it grossed $8,117,459 and ranked fourth at the box office. The film closed its run on August 1, 2008 with $43,945,766 domestically and $93,945,766 worldwide. Based on its total gross, it was considered a box office bomb. The results were well below studio expectations, given that the production costs of \"Speed Racer\" were estimated to be over $120 million. Despite the low box office numbers, Warner Bros. remained optimistic about sales of associated products ranging from toys to tennis shoes. Brad Globe, president of Warner Bros. Consumer Products, expressed hope that \"We're still going to do very well with \"Speed Racer\"\", acknowledging that \"a giant movie would have made it all a lot bigger\".\n\nThe review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes ranked \"Speed Racer\" as \"rotten\", with 40% of its selected critics giving the film positive reviews, based on 210 reviews with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus reads, \"[The Wachowskis] have overloaded \"Speed Racer\" with headache-inducing special effects, and neglected to develop a coherent storyline.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 37 out of 100, which indicates \"generally unfavorable reviews\", based on 37 reviews.\n\nWriting for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Kirk Honeycutt called \"Speed Racer\"'s visual effects \"stellar\", but stated it \"proudly denies entry into its ultra-bright world to all but gamers, fanboys and anime enthusiasts\". He criticized that story and character were \"tossed aside\" towards the \"wearying\" races. Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" noted the target audience should be amused, but others might think the film \"a cinematic pile-up\", citing its implausibility and the lack of identifiable peril in the driving sequences. While noted viewers interested in CGI would appreciate it, McCarthy said the frame sometimes resembled \"a kindergartner's art class collage\". He had praise for the cinematography, the musical score, and the cast. Anime News Network's Zac Bertschy also praised the cast, while saying the story is \"as anyone would expect\", adding \"the characters are all cardboard archetypes with Saturday Morning dialogue.\" \"Speed Racer\" \"sets out to honor and refresh a youthful enthusiasm from the past and winds up smothering the fun in self-conscious grandiosity\", declared \"The New York Times\" A. O. Scott.\n\nGlenn Kenny of \"Premiere\" criticized the film's time-shifting narrative and multiple storylines, saying it \"yields heretofore undreamed of levels of narrative incoherence\". Kenny praised the film's look, saying the \"cheez-whizziness\" that others had criticised was \"precisely the point\". He remarked the movie inspires even more thinking than \"The Matrix\" because of its \"blatantly anti-capitalist storylines\". Similarly, \"The New Yorker\"s Anthony Lane said the film could still end up \"bleached of fun\" due to the theme mooted in \"The Matrix\" that all of us are being controlled. In \"Speed Racer\", Lane argues, this comes in the form of villain Royalton, who \"vows to crush [Speed] with 'the unassailable might of money.'\" He concluded some people may call it entertaining, but he \"felt [it] like Pop fascism\". Jim Emerson, editor at the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", wrote that \"Speed Racer\" \"is a manufactured widget, a packaged commodity that capitalizes on an anthropomorphized cartoon of Capitalist Evil in order to sell itself and its ancillary products\". It was said to be \"the most tiresome piece of CGI ()\" of the \"past couple of years\" at the time of film's release by Philip French, a \"The Guardian\" critic.\n\nConversely, IGN's Todd Gilchrist gave a positive review, stating that \"Speed Racer\" \"is not merely the best film that it could be, it's pretty much exactly what it should be: full of exciting, brilliantly-conceived races, primary-color characterizations and an irresistible sense of fun\". He called \"Speed Racer\" \"a masterpiece of its kind\", praising \"the special effects extravaganza\" and \"the moment when the Wachowskis went from wunderkind directors to true auteurs\". Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" described \"Speed Racer\" as \"buoyant pop entertainment and noted the Wachowskis respected \"the themes of honor, dishonor, family loyalty and Visigoth-inspired barbarism behind the wheel\" of the original work. The cast is praised as being \"earnest\" and \"gently playful\". However, he stated that \"it sags in its midsection\" with unnecessary dialogue. Although it was said to be among the worst films of the year by Rebecca Murray of About.com, she included \"Speed Racer\" on her list of \"Top 10 Action Movies of 2008\", stating \"the action sequences are definitely eye-catching.\" \"Time\" magazine included \"Speed Racer\" on its list of \"The All-Time 25 Best Sports Movies\" and \"Top 10 Movies of 2008\". It said \"Not every avant-garde FX masterpiece receives instant audience validation\", described the film as \"a rich, cartoonish dream: non-stop Op art, and a triumph of virtual virtuosity.\"\n\nHowever, in later years, the film has appeared periodically on lists of underrated films. \"Speed Racer\" was elected the third most underrated film of the 2000s by Den of Geek's N.P. Horton, which called it \"a game-changing film which redefined and reconceptualised the film form as we know it.\" Nick Hyman, writing for Metacritic, included the film on its list of \"movies that critics got wrong\" calling it \"a cult classic in the making\". It was described as \"nearly unmatched [...] insofar as action/adventure/family films go\" by Alejandro Stepenberg from JoBlo.com, while \"Slate\"s Chris Wade named it \"an underrated masterpiece,\" stating \"they [the Wachowskis] made a brilliant visual cartoon that dares to ask that you take it seriously.\" Annalee Newitz of io9 analyzed the ten reasons why she believes the film to be an \"unsung masterpiece\"; among them, the visuals, the humor, and even its political themes. Tor.com's Dexter Palmer considered the possibility that the film is a \"misunderstood art film\", highlighting its color scheme that is a \"pleasure\" and the fact it does not try to seem real. Palmer lauded it because he does not think films must imitate reality, and ultimately said it is \"an extreme reminder of what films, and especially fantasy and science fiction films, can place on screen\" and that it is \"a refreshing change of pace\" in film industry. Collider's Kayti Burt ranked it at #30 of Best Hollywood Blockbusters of the 21st Century stating, \"While other blockbusters of the year (and the decade) worked to ground their fantastical premises in a gritty, realistic setting, Speed Racer leaned hard in the other direction.\"\n\n\"Speed Racer\" was nominated at the Golden Trailer Awards for \"Summer 2008 Blockbuster\", at the MTV Movie Award for \"Best Summer Movie So Far\", at the Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award for \"Best Sound Editing: Sound Effects and Foley in a Feature Film\", at the Visual Effects Society Awards for \"Outstanding Matte Paintings in a Feature Motion Picture\". At the 2008 Teen Choice Awards, \"Speed Racer\" was a nominee in the category of \"Movie: Action Adventure\", \"Movie Actor: Action Adventure\" and \"Movie Actress: Action Adventure\". On other hand, the film has also nominated for the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards in the category of Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel.\n\nWarner Home Video released \"Speed Racer\" on DVD and Blu-ray on September 16, 2008. The three-disc set features the main feature and supplemental features on the first disc, the DVD game \"Speed Racer Crucible Challenge\" on the second disc, and a digital copy of the film on the third disc—the last two being exclusive to the Blu-ray release. The U.S. DVD sales reached $6,268,301 and 390,191 copies in the first week, with consumer spending of $14,277,546 and 900,361 copies sold by 2013, and grossed as of 2018. The Blu-ray version was re-released on May 18, 2010.\n\n\"Variety\" discussed a possible sequel, saying it could happen if \"Speed Racer\" had a good box office performance. In 2008, a possible sequel was contemplated by the Wachowskis when Rain asked them why his character is so happy for Speed winning, and they replied it could be explained in the next film. Rain said he was hired for three years, while noting that does not guarantee that a sequel will be released. Christina Ricci also considered it a possibility; she stated \"When we [the cast] were all leaving, we were like 'write the sequel!' 'We want to come back'. And they [the Wachowskis] were like, 'I know. I know. We're going to. Don't worry'.\", adding she would like more action scenes to her character. The producer Joel Silver said that the Wachowskis \"have a great story idea for a sequel\" but that it is \"a great idea for a sequel if it makes sense to make it.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1922473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922473", "title": "Tarrasch rule", "text": "Tarrasch rule\n\nThe Tarrasch rule is a general principle that applies in the majority of chess middlegames and endgames. Siegbert Tarrasch (1862–1934) stated the \"rule\" that rooks should be placed behind passed pawns – either yours or your opponent's. The idea behind the guideline is that (1) if a player's rook is behind his passed pawn, the rook protects it as it advances, and (2) if it is behind an opponent's passed pawn, the pawn cannot advance unless it is protected along its way.\n\nThe original quote, from page 57 of his book \"The Game of Chess\" (1938) is: In complicated Rook endings the most important rule is one laid down by the author: The Rook's place is behind the passed pawn; behind the enemy pawn in order to hold it up, behind one's own in order to support its advance.\n\nThis \"rule\" is usually true, but not always, as there are many exceptions. Tarrasch has been quoted as saying, \"Always put the rook behind the pawn... Except when it is incorrect to do so.\" .\nConsider the diagram on the right. On the b-file, White's rook is behind his pawn, while Black's is in front of it. In a vacuum, Black cannot do much to stop the pawn's advance. He can block it, but as soon as it must back up or move elsewhere to accomplish some other goal, the pawn can advance. In addition, as the pawn advances, the space the rook can move to attack it continues to shrink. By contrast, the white rook's range increases as the pawn advances, while it defends it from attack equally well at all distances. Thus, a rook is better-placed behind one's own pawn.\n\nOn the g-file, the roles are reversed: White's rook is behind Black's pawn, with Black's rook in front. As the pawn advances, White's rook has more freedom of movement, while Black's becomes ever more constrained. White cannot actively block the pawn, but he does not need to; if Black wishes to promote, he must at some point move the rook out of the way, which if there is no other support leads to the pawn's immediate capture. Thus, a rook is better-placed behind the enemy's pawn.\n\nHere are two positions to illustrate the principle.\n\nIn the first diagram, White's rook is behind his passed pawn on the \"a\"-, and the position is won for White.\n\nThe winning technique is straightforward:\nThe 34th game of the 1927 World Championship match between Alekhine and Capablanca is a classic example of the technique (or see annotated text). The position is after White's 54.Ra4. White won on move 82 .\n\nSimilar positions with the rook behind the enemy passed pawn are usually a draw, but not always. The next position is after White's 35th move in the eighth game of the Henrique Mecking versus Victor Korchnoi match in 1974. White will move Ra6 as soon as possible. Black's rook is in front of his passed pawn on the a-file, and the game ended in a draw on move 55 .\nIn this game between Viswanathan Anand and Vladimir Kramnik from the 2007 World Chess Championship, Black's rook is in front of his passed pawn; the white rook will get behind the pawn:\nBlack advanced the pawn to a2, but could do no better than to exchange the passed pawn and rook for the white rook, reaching a king and pawn endgame that ended in a draw (see stalemate) on move 65 .\nIn the position from a game between Wolfgang Unzicker and Erik Lundin, White to move wins, however 48. f3+! is the only winning move. If the black pawn were still on f7, the black king could go back to f6 or g7 and the position would be a draw. (If 48.a7? Ra2+ and 49...Kf3 draws.)\n\nThe reason this type of position was long thought to be an easy draw is as follows:\n\nRecent theoretical analysis of this position shows that White has a strong maneuver: \nBlack must play very carefully to draw, rather than the very easy draw that was long thought to be the case.\nKantorovich analyzed the position in the diagram on the right and thought that Black draws with two tempos to spare. In 2003 Steckner found an improvement for White that wins. Black's pieces are in their optimum positions: the rook is behind the a-pawn and attacking the f-pawn and the king is in its most active location. If 1.Ra8 Kf5 Black has an easy draw; however, White has a better plan which wins with precise play:\n\nThis 2008 game between Levon Aronian and Vassily Ivanchuk ended in a draw after 62 moves. The evaluation of this type of position with an extra b-pawn is still in flux as of 2010, but current theory is that it is drawish .\n\nThere are exceptions to the Tarrasch rule. Here are some.\n\nThis position from Nigel Short and Artur Yusupov in 1984 is an exception to the rule, since white's king is stuck in front of the pawn . White played 1. Rh3 (rook behind passed pawn), Black replied 1... Kf5 and a draw resulted a few moves later. The move 1. Rf7 by White leads to a win.\n\nThe position from a 1995 game between Andrei Kharlov and Alexander Morozevich is one in which the Tarrasch rule does not apply (for Black) . The move 1...Rb7 would be in accordance with the Tarrasch rule, but 1... Re5 is the correct method because White's king is cut off from the pawn, White will have to spend a lot of time activating his rook, and by that time the black king will be able to get over to the queenside. The rule still applies for White, however, and the game continued:\n\nAfter 13.Kg2 Rc1 14.Rd8 b1=Q 15.Rb8+ Kc6 16.Rxb1 Rxb1 Black's king is close enough to the kingside pawns to stop them.\n\nThe 1993 game between Vladimir Kramnik and Alexander Beliavsky has an unusual position in which following the Tarrasch Rule is incorrect. White played 1. Ra1 and lost. 1.Rb8, abandoning the pawn so the rook can attack from behind, draws. The endgame with rooks and f- and h-pawns was analyzed to be a draw by Mikhail Botvinnik in the 1940s (with correct defense) .\n\nIn this 1992 game between Artur Yusupov and Jan Timman, 35.Re4! wins but 35. Ra1? in the actual game only draws. The game was drawn twenty moves later .\n\nBibliography\n"}

{"id": "1257944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1257944", "title": "WACA Ground", "text": "WACA Ground\n\nThe WACA (formally the WACA Ground) is a sports stadium in Perth, Western Australia. The stadium's name derives from the initials of its owners and operators, the Western Australian Cricket Association.\n\nThe WACA was Western Australia's \"home of cricket\" since the early 1890s, with Test cricket played at the ground since the 1970–71 season. The ground is the home venue of Western Australia's first-class cricket team, the Western Warriors, and a Women's National Cricket League side, the Western Fury. The Perth Scorchers, a Big Bash League franchise, also play at the ground, which is branded #TheFurnace for those matches. As of 2018, many international cricket matches and Big Bash games are played at the new Perth Stadium.\n\nThe pitch at the WACA is regarded as the quickest and bounciest in the world. These characteristics, in combination with the afternoon sea-breezes which regularly pass the ground (the Fremantle Doctor), have historically made the ground an attractive place for pace and swing bowlers. The outfield is exceptionally fast, contributing to the ground seeing some very fast scoring – as of February 2016, four of the nine fastest Test centuries have been scored at the WACA. The WACA has also hosted 7 scores of 99 in Test cricket - the most of any ground in the world.\n\nThroughout its history, the ground has also been used for a range of other sports, including athletics carnivals, Australian rules football, baseball, soccer, rugby league, rugby union, and international rules football. However, recent years have seen most of these activities relocated to other venues. It has also been used for major rock concerts.\n\nWilliam Henry Wise, a gardener who came to WA from England in 1880, laid the first turf wicket at the WACA. Wise was personal gardener to Sir George Shenton, of Crawley. In addition to his work at the WACA Ground, he laid the first tennis court on the Perth Esplanade.\n\nThe Western Australian Cricket Association was officially established on 25 November 1885 under the Presidency of JCH James. In 1893, the WACA ground was officially opened, occupying a site of old swamp land to the east of the city. The association has a 999-year lease over the land (which expires in 2888). The long term of the lease means that, effectively, the association has freehold title (save that it cannot divest itself of any part of the land without the state government's consent). Originally, the title covered 29 acres (117,000 m²), and took in what is now Gloucester Park. However, the latter part of the land was divested to the Trotting Association in the early 1920s. Between 1977 and 1979, (then-rebel) World Series Cricket matches were played at Gloucester Park because the Kerry Packer-led organisation was not granted access to the WACA.\n\nThe first match played on the turf wickets took place in February 1894. However, difficulties encountered in transporting teams to Western Australia meant that the ground was not part of Australia's main cricket community for many years. Even with the building of a transcontinental railway, the trip from the eastern states still took several days. It took the introduction of scheduled flights to Western Australia to make the WACA readily accessible to interstate or overseas teams.\n\nJames Gardiner, president of the WACA for three terms between 1897 and 1924, proposed the adoption of 'electorate' cricket (as it was first known) whereby teams were established on a district basis for competition. He also inaugurated Country Week cricket, during which country teams compete against each other. In 1907, the WACA ground was under threat of being controlled by the Perth City Council to recover debts. Gardiner led the bid to save the ground and secured a government loan. Further financial difficulties led Gardiner to again raise funds and donations with a cricket match by the Australian XI team in 1912.\n\nThe WACA ground, like many stadiums of its era, has undergone various re-developments. The most notable are:\nThese redevelopments also made the venue an attractive venue for sports other than cricket, and it was during the late 1980s and early 1990s that the ground saw its greatest use as a multi-sports venue. From 1987 to 2000, the ground was used by the West Coast Eagles, and from 1995 by the Fremantle Dockers, both Perth-based AFL teams. 72 AFL matches were held at the ground during this time. From 1995 to 1997 the WACA also served as the home ground for the Western Reds rugby league team. In the late 1990s the ground played host to the Perth Heat in the former Australian Baseball League (1989-1999).\n\nHowever, for various reasons these sports moved away from the WACA (in the case of night football, to Subiaco Oval), and as a consequence the WACA was again redeveloped in 2002. The capacity of the ground was reduced to around 20,000 and the dimensions of the playing arena were also decreased by a total of 31 metres at the eastern and western boundaries, meaning Australian rules football could no longer be played at the ground. From time to time, temporary stands are used to boost the ground's capacity to 24,500.\n\nIn 2013, a new video screen was installed at the WACA near the old scoreboard, replacing one of the old temporary screens.\n\nThe WACA Museum (located on-site) features exhibits about Western Australian cricket.\n\nIn April 2007 the Western Australian Cricket Association announced a $250m redevelopment of the stadium. Seating capacity was to be increased, with residential and commercial buildings built in the surrounding areas. The project was to be done in partnership with Ascot Capital Limited with a three- to four-year time frame. WACA members gave final approval for the project in July 2010 and construction was expected to commence in March 2011. However, by November 2011 work on the redevelopment had still yet to commence, and it was reported that delays could continue for years. Although the project received finance, tax office and members' approval, adverse market conditions were believed to have made the project unfeasible. The redevelopment was also the subject of a dispute between the WACA and the Australian Cricketers Association, with the players' union seeking 26 per cent of the value of the project.\nIn November 2012 the WACA and Ascot Capital Limited commenced selling 137 apartments in \"The Gardens\", a planned 10-storey residential complex to be located on the western boundary line of the ground. Construction of The Gardens was expected to commence mid-2013 and be completed by mid-2015. The agreement between the WACA and Ascot Capital would have seen new northern grandstands, an increase in ground capacity and a long term revenue stream. However, in December 2013 the WACA released a statement that it had abandoned the so-called Gardens Development because it was unable to achieve the pre-sales target in order to finance the project.\n\nIn September 2013 Cricket Australia announced that the WACA ground would not host a Test match in the shortened 2014/15 season to accommodate the 2015 Cricket World Cup, a decision which left Perth without a summer test match for the first time in nearly 40 years. Cricket Australia said the WACA Ground required significant improvements, given it has the smallest capacity of the five mainland capital city venues.\n\nAs of the 2018/19 summer, the WACA Ground is no longer the primary international cricket venue in Perth. Perth Stadium in Burswood now hosts limited overs internationals, Test matches against high-drawing opponents (England, India and South Africa), and domestic Big Bash League (BBL) matches for Perth Scorchers. The WACA Ground will continue to host Tests against lower-drawing opponents, Sheffield Shield matches, and will be redeveloped into the state's leading cricket training facility.\n\n\n\nThe WACA has a cricket museum just next to the ground. Visitors can view memorabilia of Australian cricket.\nThey display not only the history of cricket, but also other sports played at the WACA.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13554964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13554964", "title": "World Pump Festival", "text": "World Pump Festival\n\nWorld Pump Festival, better known as World Pump It Up Festival or WPF, is a competition and event focusing on the dance game \"Pump It Up\" which takes place in various time slots. \"Pump It Up\" is a Korean game that requires physical movement of the feet. The game is open for breakdancing, and many people have accomplished this feat by memorizing the steps and creating dance moves to hit the arrows on time. What separates this from other Machine dance tournaments is the large amount of prize money on offer and national qualifiers around the world.\n\nAt WPF, the best technical and freestyle players are flown from several countries to compete in their respective categories: Speed and Freestyle. As of 2006, a Female Speed category was introduced. The candidates are selected by tournaments held in their respective country by Supporters and Club Leaders - Members of the Pump community who work unpaid for Andamiro, organise tournaments and social events during the year. As well as the competition itself, Andamiro takes players and spectators on a tour of the host country, as a form of tourism aiming to promote the game as a sport for weight loss using videogames and Korean culture to create friendship between players. Previous locations of WPF have been held in Korea at G Star, Lotte World and more recently, Mexico City. Nationals (qualifiers for WPF) in Mexico and Brazil have been held in sports stadiums.\n\nCompetitors in the freestyle category incorporate elements of locking, salsa, funk styles, popping, hip hop dance, breakdance, street dance and other types of dance and theatrical movements into performances. It has become the norm to make a routine using choreography while facing the audience.\n\nAndamiro provides a round trip flight, hotel, meals, transportation and tour at WPF for national winners. Spectators wishing to travel also have accommodation and most expenses covered.\n\n\"NOTE: Players can ONLY compete in 1 division!\"\n\nPlayers will achieve the highest score possible. Technical players focus on timing and pattern reading during gameplay, while minimizing combo breaking because combo breaking will disrupt the multiplier. Speed entrants (both in the male and female category) will practice the game on the most difficult songs/highest difficulty levels in an attempt to perfect their scores. The following rounds are as follows:\nPump players will choose to incorporate complex or flashy techniques into their play movements, and develop intricate dance routines to perform during a song. Freestyle players tend to choose songs on lower difficulty levels or Freestyle-based Performance Charts designed for it, so that the player is not restricted in their movements by large quantities of required steps. Freesylers can choose between performing solo or have a partner involved. This category contains 2 rounds: Preliminary and final (Top 8 or Top 4). The scorecard are as follows:\nA Supporter is a person who is the main point of contact between their respective country and Andamiro Korea. Any events and tournaments held require a written report with photos/videos sent to Andamiro, in exchange for prizes and recognition of athletes to enter WPF. A Club Leader is the person in charge of their respective club and should use their best efforts to maintain a close relationship with their Supporter. Clubs are normally (but not exclusively) town specific and focus on events in their area. As of 2007 a minimum of 10 officially recognised clubs are required per country to validate them for WPF (150 club members). Excellent club organisers can be designated as jurors in competitions for selecting national team members and also the WPF competition itself. If this is the case, Andamiro pays for all WPF jurors expenses, like WPF athletes. Andamiro gives prize money two times a year to the club's treasurer for club activities. Members who make a forum post, upload a picture/video or high score for the home/arcade versions of the game receive points. These can be exchanged in the online store for T-shirts, Sweatbands, Visors, CD's/DVD's and signed MP3 players by Banya (musical group).\n\nThis was the first year Andamiro hosted its first-ever World Pump Festival. This was hosted in Korea. The primary machine used for this was Pump It Up Exceed 2. The total prize offered was $129,000.\n\nWorld Pump Festival returns to Korea. The primary machine used for this was Pump It Up Zero. Female Speed was introduced to the competition, while removing Battle Station as part of their lineup. The total prize offered was $146,000.\n\nThe biggest change with World Pump Festival was the move to Mexico. The primary machine used for this was Pump It Up NX. The total prize offered was $148,000. This is the last World Pump Festival to consistently be annual as the next one wasn't until 2011.\n\nAfter a long 3 year Hiatus, in 2010 Andamiro began hinting at WPF 2011, with the new release of \"PIU Fiesta EX\". Fiesta EX is the official version used in WPF 2011 and used a \"Random for WPF\" channel ver. WPF2011 was held in China, August 25 - 27, 2011 / GTI Game Show in Guangzhou.\n\nThe biggest change in this event was allowing the use of the bar for all divisions, primarily Male Speed. Previously, bar was prohibited until this event, drastically changing the landscape of the competition. Because Fiesta removed the traditional difficulties (Crazy and Nightmare), they are replaced with actual difficulty numbers, making navigation easier (See Speed above).\n\nUpon the release of Pump It Up Prime, World Pump Festival was announced both in the pamphlet and credits in the machine. The year of the festival was changed from 2015 to 2016.\n\nOn February 23, Andamiro released the official ruleset for the upcoming WPF.\n\nA video on April 18, 2016 confirmed that World Pump Festival will take place at Bali, Indonesia on July 23, 2016.\n\nAndamiro has released full details of WPF 2016:\n\nAnnounced at this WPF was Pump It Up PRIME 2, scheduled for a November 2016 release.\n\nResults:\n\n4th Place and everything else TBA.\n\nEntries List:\nNote: All sections listed as \"N/A\" did not meet minimum requirements to qualify for WPF or did not manage to travel for WPF.\n\n\n"}

Originally, racing took place over fences and on the flat, but in 1878 the course moved to Harville Farm and flat racing ceased. Steeplechases, however, continued to be held in September, January, March, and May.\n\nThe last racing took place at Wye on 2 May 1974 and the course closed permanently in June 1975. \nThe Jockey Club had insisted upon changes to the course in August 1974, including changing the camber of the bottom turn and improving the grandstand. However, the owners were unable to fund these changes, leading to closure. Wye was a very small, oval track, less than 1 mile (1.6 km) round.\n\nThe land is now farmed, although some evidence of the racecourse can still be seen from satellite photographs.\n"}
