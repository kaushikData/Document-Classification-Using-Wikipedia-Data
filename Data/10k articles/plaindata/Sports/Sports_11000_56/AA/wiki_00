{"id": "42965177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42965177", "title": "Albertsons Stadium", "text": "Albertsons Stadium\n\nAlbertsons Stadium is an outdoor athletic stadium in the western United States, located on the campus of Boise State University in Boise, Idaho. It is the home field of the Boise State Broncos of the Mountain West Conference. Known as Bronco Stadium for its first 44 seasons, it was renamed in May 2014 when Albertsons, a chain of grocery stores founded by Boise area resident Joe Albertson, purchased the naming rights.\n\nOpened in 1970, it was also a track & field stadium and hosted the NCAA track & field championships twice, in 1994 and 1999. The stadium was used extensively for local high school football for decades until August 2012, when games were transferred a few blocks northeast to the new Dona Larsen Park, which is also the new home venue of Boise State's track & field team.\n\nAlbertsons Stadium is widely known for its unusual blue playing surface, installed in 1986, while Boise State was in the Big Sky Conference. It was the first non-green playing surface (outside of painted end zones) in football history and remained the only one among NCAA Division I FBS schools for almost 20 years. \n\nSince 1997, it has hosted the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl (also called the Humanitarian Bowl from 1997 to January 2004 & 2007 to 2010; as well as the MPC Computers Bowl from 2004 to 2006), which is the longest-running outdoor bowl game in a cold-weather venue.\n\nAlbertsons Stadium is located at the east end of the BSU campus, bordered by Broadway Avenue to the east, University Drive to the south, and the Boise River to the north. The elevation of its playing field is above sea level.\n\nAlbertsons Stadium is the first venue to hold its name. However, when it was Bronco Stadium, it was the fourth venue and second of the same name at Boise State; the three on-campus stadiums were built in 1940, 1950, and 1970, respectively.\n\nDuring its first years at its original campus, BJC football was played at \"Public School Field\", located three blocks north-northeast of today's Albertsons Stadium. The site was the home of East Junior High School from 1953 to 2009 until it was demolished and rebuilt further down Warm Springs Ave., and the previous area became Dona Larsen Park in 2012.\n\nAfter the college moved to its present campus in 1940, \"College Field\" opened in September 1940 with lights and a seating capacity of 1,000. Also called \"Chaffee Field\", it was used through 1949 for junior college football (photo - 1940s). In the 1950s, it became the baseball field, aligned southeast, until right field was displaced by the construction of the Student Union Building, which opened in 1967. The baseball field migrated slightly east, then north, with a new northeast alignment and home plate at (). It was eliminated in 1980 by the construction of the BSU Pavilion and the relocation of the tennis courts. (Baseball was dropped by both BSU and Idaho following the 1980 season; the Broncos played home games at Borah Field during their final season.)\n\nThe first \"Bronco Stadium\" was built in three months in 1950 at the east end of campus, with wooden grandstands, a natural grass playing field, lights, and a cinder running track; seating capacity was 10,000. It was in approximately the same location as the present stadium, but aligned northwest to southeast. (photo - 1964) The 45° offset was designed to keep the mid-afternoon sun of mid-October out of the players' eyes (but put it into the eyes of half of the spectators).\n\nFrom the 1920s through 1968, the University of Idaho Vandals of Moscow usually played one home game per season in Boise, often against schools from Oregon or Utah. Boise State joined the Big Sky in 1970, and Idaho discontinued its practice of scheduling home games in Boise, sometimes referred to as \"southern homecoming.\" (Idaho did use the new Bronco Stadium for a \"home\" game in 1971, but it was against Boise State in the first football game ever played between the schools. Idaho's new stadium on campus in Moscow was behind schedule, so the university rented Bronco Stadium for its opening game. The underdog \"visitors\" of Boise State built a 28–7 lead at halftime and won handily 42–14 and a rivalry game was born.)\n\nThe Boise College football program upgraded from junior college to four-year status in 1968 and competed as an NAIA independent for two seasons. The school became Boise State College in 1969 and the Broncos were accepted into the NCAA in October. A month later the school was voted into the Big Sky Conference, effective fall 1970. Following the 1969 football season, the first Bronco Stadium was razed in November and the new concrete stadium was ready for play in less than ten months.\n\nBoise State began NCAA competition in 1970 in the College Division (became Division II in 1973) in a brand new venue. The first game at the new Bronco Stadium was on September 11, a 49–14 victory over Chico State. The $2.2 million concrete stadium opened with a seating capacity of 14,500 and a green AstroTurf playing field, configured in the traditional north-south direction, and an all-weather running track. For its first five seasons, the stadium consisted of two sideline grandstands, the west side having an upper deck and the press box. (photo - 1971) Boise State became a charter member of Division II when the NCAA reorganized the former College Division in 1973.\n\nFollowing the 1974 season, the school's first as Boise State University, an upper deck was added to the east side (photo - 1971) – (photo -1975), adding 5,500 seats as well as symmetry to the stadium. The permanent seating capacity grew to 20,000 for its Bronco Stadium's sixth season in 1975, with up to 2,600 temporary seats available in the north end zone seating for bigger games. The original green artificial turf was replaced with the same in 1978 as the Big Sky and the Broncos moved up to the newly formed Division I-AA. (photo - mid 1980s) The Broncos moved to the Big West and Division I-A in 1996, which resulted in another stadium expansion. The two-tier grandstands were extended around the corners of the south end zone, raising the permanent seating capacity to 30,000 in 1997. The latest stadium expansion was completed in time for the 2008 season, with the addition of the Stueckle Sky Club press box, luxury suites, loge boxes, and club seating; raising the capacity to 32,000. In the summer of 2009, 1,500 additional bleacher seats were added to the south end zone to bring capacity up to 33,500. Prior to the 2012 season, expanded bleacher sections were added to the north and south end zones, expanding capacity to a total of 36,387.\n\nDuring its 11th season, the playing field at Bronco Stadium was named Lyle Smith Field during the I-AA national championship season of 1980. Ceremonies during halftime of the 14–3 victory over Nevada on November 8 marked the event. It honors Lyle H. Smith, the head coach from 1947 to 1967 and athletic director from 1968 to 1981, overseeing BSU's rise from the junior college ranks to Division I-AA champions in 1980.\n\nSmith led Boise, as BJC, to multiple post-season bowls, including the 1958 national junior college championship, and compiled an overall record of (), which included five undefeated seasons and 16 conference titles. He was also the baseball coach for 17 seasons and served as basketball coach for a season at the school. Smith hired Tony Knap to replace himself as football coach in 1968, and Jim Criner to replace Knap in 1976.\n\nThe current attendance record is 36,864, set on September 20, 2012 against BYU.\n\nIn 2015, the stadium played host to a soccer friendly on July 18, named the Basque Soccer Friendly, between Athletic Bilbao of La Liga vs Club Tijuana of Liga MX. To accommodate the game, a natural grass surface was laid on top of the famous blue turf to conform to La Liga rules. It was the first time since 1985 that the stadium featured a green surface for any sporting event. Before a crowd of 21,948, Athletic Bilbao won 2–0.\n\nAlbertsons Stadium is best known for its distinctive blue playing surface, which was the only non-green football playing surface among Division I FBS programs from Boise State's entry into what is now FBS in 1996 until Eastern Michigan installed a gray surface at Rynearson Stadium in 2014.\n\nChris Berman of ESPN has also called Boise's turf \"The Blue Plastic Tundra\", a joking reference to \"the frozen tundra\" of Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Another nickname for the surface is \"Smurf Turf.\" Players refer to it simply as \"The Blue.\"\n\nAfter sixteen seasons of playing on standard green AstroTurf, athletic director Gene Bleymaier came up with the idea to install the blue turf. He decided that, if BSU was going to spend $750,000 on a new surface, he didn't want to see BSU install yet another green field, and that a blue field might provide some national notoriety for the school, then a member of the Big Sky Conference. Bleymaier gained the support of BSU President John Keiser, and on September 13, 1986, Bronco Stadium introduced its unique playing surface to the world with a 74-0 victory over Division II Humboldt State. (BSU was 4–2 at home in 1986, but managed just one road victory and posted its first losing record in four decades, resulting in the resignation of fourth-year head coach Lyle Setencich.)\n\nBSU replaced the first blue AstroTurf with the same in 1995, then with blue Astroplay (a grass-like synthetic surface that is more forgiving than traditional AstroTurf) in 2002. The AstroPlay field lasted just six seasons and was replaced in the summer of 2008 with blue FieldTurf surface. Due to complaints by fans that the reflection and glare off the field gave the new field a dull and uneven shade of blue, FieldTurf agreed to replace the field free of charge. The fifth blue turf was installed in the summer of 2010.\n\nThe unique blue turf has spawned several myths. The most prevalent is that the NCAA subsequently banned playing surface colors other than green, but allowed Albertsons Stadium's field to remain blue under a grandfather clause. In reality, the NCAA has never adopted such a rule. Any school may color its playing surface (or any part of the surface, such as the end zones) any color it wishes. Indeed, since 1986 other schools have non-green football fields including the University of New Haven (blue) and Eastern Washington University (red). On April 1, 2011, the University of Central Arkansas announced it would install a purple and grey striped field to Estes Stadium. In 2012, Lindenwood University in Belleville, Illinois, played their first football season, on a home field with alternating maroon and gray stripes. The blue turf at Boise State remained the only non-traditionally colored field used by a Division I FBS program until June 2014, when Eastern Michigan announced it would install a gray FieldTurf surface at Rynearson Stadium in time for the 2014 season.\n\nAnother myth is that, mistaking the blue field for a large body of water, birds have flown into the blue turf and to their deaths. Although Bronco head coach Chris Petersen claimed to have found a dead duck on the field in 2007, the origin of the duck on the field has never been confirmed.\n\nBSU's blue turf has become such a highly visible icon for the Broncos that BSU obtained a U.S. trademark registration for a blue athletics field in November 2009. In 2010, this trademark was extended to any non-green field.\n\nIn , the NFL banned any playing surface color other than green, naming the rule the \"Boise Rule\" in reference to the university, though this was more a reaction to sponsor influence as no team had ever proposed a different turf color for its field. Also in 2011, the Mountain West Conference banned Boise from wearing its all-blue uniforms during home conference games, after complaints from other Mountain West coaches that it was an unfair advantage. However, the uniform restriction was removed from the 2013 season forward, as part of the deal that kept Boise State in the MW after it had originally planned to leave the conference.\n\nIn October 2014, Boise State's blue field topped USA Today's Fan Index list of top 10 best fields in college football.\n\nAs the Boise State football program rose to national prominence in the early 2000s, Albertsons Stadium became increasingly insufficient. The school completed a three-story complex on the stadium's west side called the Stueckle Sky Club (pronounced \"Stickle\"). Construction began on February 11, 2007, and the facility officially opened on August 27, 2008 with a gala for ticket holders prior to the first game on August 30. It features levels for a new press box, luxury suites, loge boxes, and club seating and increased seating capacity to 32,000.\n\nThe practice facility, named the Caven-Williams Sports Complex, officially opened in February 2006, and is located immediately northwest of Albertsons Stadium. The university added additional temporary seating for 1,500 prior to the 2009 season. The removable bleachers increased capacity to 33,500. It also added permanent bleachers to the north and south end zones prior to the 2012 season, raising Albertsons Stadium's capacity to a total of 37,000.\n\nIn late August 2010, the athletic department revealed expansion plans for Albertsons Stadium. The first stages were to include adding a new facility to the north end zone to house the football offices, weight room, training room, equipment room and locker room. Plans also included a 13,200 seat grandstand. The later stages of the expansion plan included removal of the track, lowering of the field, and adding 3,300 seats in front of the first deck of the stadium, completion of the south end zone horseshoe, building of an east side skybox, and renovation of the east side concourse. The total cost for all planned expansions was around $100 million. The total seating capacity for a fully expanded Albertsons Stadium was estimated to be around 53,000. In April 2012, the university broke ground on a revised expansion which it hoped to complete by June 2013.\nDuring Boise State's recent streak of conference championships, Albertsons Stadium has proven to be a tough place for opponents. As of November 24, 2018, the Broncos are 121–9 () at home since the 1999 season. The Broncos won 47 straight home conference games from 1999 to 2011 and were undefeated in conference during their 10 years in the WAC (40–0). The Broncos are 116–8 () in regular season home games since 1999, and had a winning streak of 65 regular season games from 2001 to 2011. Their current home winning streak stands at 0 following their loss to Fresno State in the 2018 Mountain West Championship Game\n\nThe stadium expanded to 36,387 in 2012 and the highest attendances have all come since.\n\n\n"}

The Babe Ruth League consists of five divisions: Cal Ripken Baseball (ages 4–12), Babe Ruth Baseball (ages 13–18), Babe Ruth Softball (ages 4–18), Bambino Buddy Ball (ages 5–20), and Xtreme Fastpitch (ages 6–18).\n\nBaseball Hall of Fame inductees who played Babe Ruth League include Carl Yastrzemski, Joe Morgan, Jim Palmer, Rod Carew, George Brett, Nolan Ryan, Cal Ripken, Jr., Frank Thomas, Randy Johnson, John Smoltz, and Mike Piazza.\n\nIn 1951, ten men, who believed that the future of their community depended upon the proper development of the young people, met at the historic Yardville Hotel in Hamilton, New Jersey, for the purpose of developing a baseball program for young men between 13 and 15 years of age. Babe Ruth League, Inc. recognizes Marius D. Bonacci as the Founding Father of the program, along with the contribution of the following nine men, Samuel M. Welch, Ferdinand J. Wagner, Ed Jones, Ted Jasek, Cliff Fovour, Boots Snyder, William Dombrowski, Maskill Paxson and Willard Carson, Jr. Originally organized under the name Little Bigger League, Claire Merritt Ruth, the widow of Babe Ruth, met with the league's organizers in 1954 and authorized them to rename the league in Ruth's honor.\n\nIn 1974, the 13-Year-Old Prep League was added. The Prep League allows 13-year-old players to make the transition to the regulation size diamond, while competing with peers their own age.\n\nIn 1982, Babe Ruth Baseball added yet another division to its program, the Bambino division for players ages 4–12.\n\nIn 1984, Babe Ruth League, Inc. added another dimension to its program — Babe Ruth Softball. The Softball Division encompasses players 4 to 18 years of age. The program was organized because Babe Ruth League, Inc. saw a need for a quality national softball program. The softball program was designed to focus on all ability levels of young female athletes, providing them with the same enriching athletic experience as the baseball divisions.\n\nJuly 6, 1999 was the beginning of a new era for Babe Ruth League, Inc. The Bambino Division was renamed “Cal Ripken Baseball, a Division of Babe Ruth League, Inc.” Cal Ripken, Jr.’s visions and philosophies, molded by his father, Cal Ripken, Sr., directly parallel those of Babe Ruth League, Inc. Now, two of the most prolific legends and heroes in baseball, inspire in our youth participants their knowledge, spirit and pure passion for the game.\n\nIn 2000 the Buddy-Ball Division for players ages 5-20 who are physically and/or mentally challenged was renamed the Bambino BuddyBall Division. A “buddy” helps the player swing a bat, round the bases, catch a ball.\n\n2013 saw the addition of Xtreme Fastpitch to accommodate all softball participants—those who wish to play on a recreational level to those who seek a higher degree of competition to hone their skills with the goal of continuing play into high school and beyond.\n\nFeatures a 50' pitching distance and 70' base paths, this division is offered as an option to the major division format, and includes a tournament trail from District competition through the World Series in Branson, Missouri featuring eight International Champions.\n\nFeatures a 46' pitching distance and 60' base paths. Special base running rules are also in effect. This division is offered as an option to the major division format, and includes a tournament trail from District competition through the World Series.\n\nRecommended for ballplayers ages 9–10. Players build and refine their fundamental skills while beginning to understand game strategy and teamwork. In most regions, participants first experience post-season tournament competition in this level, leading to the 10 Year-Old World Series.\n\nDesigned primarily for ballplayers ages 7–8, this division makes use of a pitching machine to allow for more hittable balls at the plate and more action in the field. Fear of actually being hit by a pitched ball is diminished. It makes the game safer and improves the playing confidence and ability of all participants.\n\nBallplayers ages 4–6 learn hitting and fielding fundamentals in a supportive team environment. Young athletes hit the ball from a batting tee which is height-adjusted for a level swing, batting in order through the line-up for the entire game. The primary goal is to begin to instruct young players in the fundamentals of baseball in a supportive team environment.\n\nBabe Ruth Baseball was created for ballplayers ages 13–15 who wished to continue their baseball playing experience beyond the age of 12. This is where players get their baseball cleats muddy for the first time on standard 90' diamonds under Official Baseball Rules used by Major League Baseball. In this division, teams are eligible to enter tournament competition and move along the tournament trail, culminating in a World Series. Three World Series are held in this division: one for 13 Year-Old players, one for 13 and 14 Year-Old Players, and the renowned 13-15 World Series.\n\nPlayers often express a fear of competing with 14 and 15 Year-Old players who have already experienced one or two years playing on a standard 90' diamond. Babe Ruth League introduced this prep league - comprising teams with only 13-year-old players-to foster more participation in the game for this age group. This league offers the 13-year-old player the assurance to play without age intimidation and the chance to participate in the 13-Year-Old World Series.\n\nThe highest and most accomplished level in Babe Ruth Baseball. A favorite among high school players and coaches, this division prepares players for collegiate recruiting and the professional draft. This division allows players a chance to compete through a tournament trail to reach the 16-18 Year-Old World Series.\n\nThe primary objective of the 16-Year-Old Prep program is to provide players the opportunity to stay involved in organized baseball while sharpening their skills against competition in their own age group. Any league franchised in 16-18 Babe Ruth Baseball may also choose to register a 16-Year-Old Prep League.\n\nDesigned for girls ages 4–18, age divisions offered include: 6 & Under, 8 & Under, 10 & Under, 12 & Under, 14 & Under, 16 & Under and 18 & Under. The primary emphasis of Babe Ruth Softball is on education, skill development, participation for all levels of ability and of course, having fun.\n\nA special highlight of Babe Ruth Softball is its annual tournament trail. Tournament teams from each local league are eligible to participate in District competition with winners advancing to the State and Regional levels. Entry to the official Babe Ruth Softball tournament trail is free. 12 & Under and 16 & Under Divisions advance to a World Series. Babe Ruth Softball also offers an invitational World Series for the 8 & Under, 10 & Under, and 14 & Under divisions.\n\nThe Bambino Buddy-Ball Division was established for organizations who wish to charter a league that encompasses players ages 5–20 who are either physically and/or mentally challenged. This division makes allowance for a “buddy” to help the player swing a bat, round the bases, catch a ball, etc. There are no restrictions to the age of the “buddy”. A Bambino Buddy-Ball team may be composed of players ages 5–20 and sometimes older. The Bambino Buddy-Ball division is designed so that everyone has the opportunity to have fun. \n\nThe Bambino Buddy-Ball Division allows our challenged or special needs athletes to develop confidence and positive self-esteem. It allows them to be part of organized sports and assists with physical fitness as well as their social skills. The joy and emotion you experience when you put on that first baseball uniform or cap on a challenged child’s head is like no other. As you can see, the Bambino Buddy-Ball Division is an emotionally rewarding experience for everyone as it also allows the “buddies” to feel good about helping their challenged friends, while at the same time making it a fun and memorable time for all.\n\nThere are no geographical boundaries limiting where the players who sign up for an Xtreme team come from. Participating leagues can sign up a group of players from any geographical make-up and form a team to play other Xtreme teams in special games or tournaments throughout the year.\n\nXtreme teams are eligible to play at their own facility or in local tournaments. Playing rules match High School and College playing rules to better prepare players for the next level of competition.\n\nBabe Ruth League consists of 8 Regions.\n\nBabe Ruth League offers 12 World Series to its leagues to compete in. The Babe Ruth World Series follows the tournament trail of Districts, States, Regionals, and the World Series. At the World Series, 8 Regional Champions along with the Host League and State Champion compete for the World Series Title. The World Series can be hosted by any chartered league which in turn gets an automatic bid into the World Series.\n\nThe Cal Ripken Major/70 World Series is hosted annually at the Ripken Experience in Aberdeen, MD.

It was the spring training home of the Milwaukee Brewers from 1986 to 1997 and the home field of the Arizona Fall League Chandler Diamondbacks. The ballpark was privately financed by local developers and built at a cost of $1.6 million in 1985.\n\nIn 1982, Chandler mayor Jim Patterson first approached the Brewers about moving their spring training facility from Sun City to Chandler. Patterson was aware that the owners of the Brewers' minor league ballpark in Sun City had sold the facility to private developers and the Brewers would soon need a new spring home. After leaving office, Patterson built a development he named Ocotillo, in which he placed the ballpark.\n\nIn April 1985, the Brewers agreed to move their spring training camp from Sun City, Arizona, to Chandler where local authorities planned to build a complex in exchange for the Brewers signing a 10-year lease. The Brewers moved into Compadre Stadium for the 1986 Cactus League spring training. \n\nA gas explosion inside the Brewers' locker room at Compadre Stadium during the 1986 spring training seriously burned several of the Brewer coaches. There was some speculation that hasty construction on the stadium had led to the explosion. \n\nThe Brewers departed Compadre after the 1997 season, and began Cactus League play the following year at the newly built Maryvale Baseball Park on the west side of the city of Phoenix, where the team holds spring training to this day.\n\nThe stadium structure and field went unused and fell into a state of disrepair after only being used for twelve seasons. After the Brewers departed, some of the minor league practice fields on the site were taken over by the city of Chandler to create a local park, the Snedigar Recreation Center. The seats were removed from the grandstand and animals were allowed to graze in the outfield area, but otherwise the facility was left intact.\n\nIn January 2014, Standard Pacific Homes (now CalAtlantic Homes) purchased the property and three months later submitted a proposal to tear down the ballpark and redevelop the lot as a new residential community. Demolition of the remaining complex began in late July 2014.\n\n"}

Because he is not only vain but naive, Elmer's teammates take great delight in pulling practical jokes on him. Still, he is so valuable a player that the Cubs management hides the letters from his hometown sweetheart Nellie (Patricia Ellis), so that Elmer won't bolt the team and head for home. When Nellie comes to visit Elmer, she finds him in an innocent but compromising situation with a glamorous actress (Claire Dodd). She turns her back on him, and disconsolate Elmer tries to forget his troubles at a crooked gambling house. Elmer incurs an enormous gambling debt, which the casino's owner is willing to forget if Elmer will only throw the deciding World Series game (which he refers to as the World Serious).\n\nElmer brawls with the gambler and lands in jail, where he learns of a particularly cruel practical joke that had previously been played on him. Out of spite, he refuses to play in the Big Game, and thanks to a jailhouse visit by the gamblers, it looks as though Elmer has taken a bribe, but when he shows up to play (after patching things up with Nellie), Elmer proves that he's been true-blue all along.

From the 2008–09 season, the stadium was renamed the Mercedes-Benz Arena, starting with a pre-season friendly against Arsenal on 30 July 2008.\n\nThe stadium was originally built in 1933 after designs by German architect Paul Bonatz. After It was built, it was named \"Adolf-Hitler-Kampfbahn\". From 1945 to 1949 it was called Century Stadium and later Kampfbahn and was used by US Troops to play baseball.The name Neckarstadion was used since 1949. It is home to VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga (and to the Stuttgarter Kickers when they played in the Bundesliga).\n\nAfter a major refurbishment in the late 1980s and early 1990s partly financed by Daimler-Benz, the Stuttgart town council dedicated the stadium to Gottlieb Daimler.

The steel cables connecting the roof to the frame alone weigh about 420 tons. The roof was added during the refurbishment preceding the 1993 World Athletics Championships.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Arena hosted four matches of the 1974 FIFA World Cup, two matches of the 1988 UEFA European Football Championship (a 1st Round match and a semi-final) and six games of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, including a Round of 16 game and the third-place playoff match (see below for details).\n\nThe stadium also hosted the finals of the European Cup (now known as UEFA Champions League) in 1959 (Real Madrid vs. Stade de Reims) and 1988 (PSV Eindhoven vs. S.L.

The arena has also been the venue of several Eurobowl finals of American Football in the 1990s. The last athletics event took place in September 2008, after which the stadium underwent redevelopment in order to build a football-only arena.\n\nThe redevelopment was announced along with the stadium's name change in late March 2008.

In addition, the orthopaedist who plans on specializing in sports medicine must complete certification in the sports medicine sub-specialty which is administered by the ABOS. \nEducation does not stop there; orthopaedists are required to take continuing education classes to maintain their license.\n\nOrthopaedist specializing in sports medicine have various options of employment: from serving as a team’s physician (high school, college, and professional), to running a private practice, to working in the academic setting. \n\nAccording to a salary.com, the data they collected from HR reported data in August 2008 showed that an orthopaedic surgeon, on average, made about $606,307 a year not including bonuses and benefits. \n\n"}
{"id": "34828513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34828513", "title": "Paddle-ball", "text": "Paddle-ball\n\nPaddle-ball is a sport that can be played on a court half the size of a tennis court, using paddle racquets amongst two players (singles game) or in doubles with two teams consisting of two players. The Paddle-ball racquet or paddle is plastic, smaller than a softball and has holes for less air friction. Below are the instructions for single games.\nTo play Paddle-ball, it is necessary to have a paddle (resembling a racquet ball paddle) that is no longer than 17-1/2 inches and no wider than 9 inches, weighing about 0.78 lbs. The Paddle-ball is played with a plastic paddleball, the size of a softball. Air hole in the ball give less friction. Paddleballs come in yellow and light green.\n\nPaddle-ball is normally played on a court preferably about 20 feet wide and 37 feet long with a wall that is 16 feet in height. The court has a short line, a set of service markers, 2 side lines and a long line. The service zone is the area between the short line and the service markers. At the start of the play, one person must stand inside the service zone and strike the ball against the wall. The server must stay within the service zone until the ball crosses the short line.\n\nThe ball must cross the short line on each serve. Server must stay within the serving box. Once the serve is made, the opponent must hit the ball, hitting it off the wall. If the ball bounces before it crosses the short line, a Short is called. However, if the ball bounces beyond the long line, a Long out is called. Any service where the server is not within the service zone upon service is called a Fault. The server has a second chance to serve the ball. Failure to successfully serve the ball into the court beyond the short line twice results in the receiver winning the play. The server and the receiver then switch spots. The game is played until one side wins with 15, 21, 25 or 30 points.\n\nIf the serve is good, the receiver must hit the ball before it bounces twice. If the receiver fails to successfully hit the ball back to the wall before its second bounce and have it bounce within the court, then the play stops and the server receives the point.\nIf the receiver hits the ball, but it hits the server, the play restarts again if it looked like the ball could have hit the wall. Otherwise, Fault goes to the receiver and the server wins the point.\nAfter the receiver successfully returns the ball, the server can leave the box and must hit the ball before it bounces twice. The server and receiver then alternate until either the ball bounces twice or the ball falls out of bounds.\nIf the server wins the round they gain a point. If the receiver wins, they switch spots and then it is the opponent’s turn to serve.\nIf for instance, one player blocks the other in striking the ball, a block can be called and the play is restarted. If the striker feels that hitting the ball will risk injuring another player, then a Safety can be called and the play starts again. If the server blocks the receiver deliberately it’s out on server.\n\nSERVING\nRECEIVING SERVE\nGAME PLAY\n\nA referee is not necessary in this particular game. It can be played liked gentlemen, with mutual or compromised agreements amongst the players.\n\nServer can serve anywhere within service box and must serve to major area of the court\nMajor Area: Where the server begins serve. If the ball lands anywhere outside the major area, it’s out.\nServing from middle, server must declare with side of court being served into.\nServing into a minor area must be declared or it’s a fault.\n\n"}

As one of only two ice rinks in Melbourne in the 40s and 50s, it played a central role to the sport of ice hockey in Australia. Closed in 1982, it soon suffered a major fire and was then demolished, an event later seen as a major blow to the heritage of St Kilda.\n\nThe St. Moritz was first built as the Wattle Path Palais de Danse in 1922, one of the world's largest dance halls, designed by architects Beaver & Purnell. It was the venue for the first all-Australian dance championship, and featured some of the best dance bands of Australia and America, and closed during the great depression. In 1933, the building became a film studio, Efftee Studios, for Frank W. Thring, who made some half-dozen movies in the cavernous building before abandoning the project in 1937.\n\nIn 1939, businessman Henry Hans \"Harry\" Kleiner and his wife transformed the \"Wattle Path\" to an ice rink, and the St. Moritz was born. \n\nThe grand opening of the St. Moritz Ice-skating Palais (its original name) was on Friday 10 March, 1939. The arrival of celebrities to the opening was announced on the radio station 3XY and commentary about the interior and events was provided by Norman Banks of the radio station 3KZ. The cost of entry to the official opening of the St. Moritz Ice Rink was 5 shillings, which was inclusive of tax as well as skate hire for the night for over 2000 people that attended. The St. Kilda mayor, Councillor E. C. Mitty, formally opened the new ice skating rink.\n\nThe Kleiners were sole proprietors until 1953, when they sold the business to J. Gordon and T. Molony, both champion skaters. \n\nThe St. Moritz rink operated for over forty years, but in the 1970s trade declined in the face of competition from newer venues in the suburbs as well as roller skating and discotheques. In 1980 it was sold to developers Hudson Conway and trucking magnate Lindsay Fox (who had grown up in St Kilda and played ice hockey in the venue), but continued to operate, closing suddenly in early 1982, amid fears for its future. It was then nominated to the Historic Buildings Preservation Council, but a majority of City of St Kilda councillors voted to oppose this action and uphold a demolition permit already issued. The building infamously suffered a fire later that year, leaving only the facades, which were demolished soon after. The site remained vacant until about 1990, when a hotel was constructed. Two neon signs of skating girls were rescued from the facade by local identity Tom Ingram, one of which was re-erected within the cafe of the hotel, then covered over, rediscovered in 2005, and then donated to the St Kilda Historical Society. That hotel was mooted to be itself replaced by apartments in 2017. \n\nThe Australian prime minister at the time, Robert Menzies advised that, despite the declaration of war, sport should go on, and the Victorian Ice Hockey Association made the decision to continue ice hockey with inter-rink competitions between the Melbourne Glaciarium and St. Moritz Ice Rink teams. The St. Moritz Bombers won the first 3 games. There was also inter-team competition between the Rhodes Motor Co. Topliners and Foy's Gibsonia Fliers.\n\nA highlight moment for inter-state ice hockey happened during the annual tournament, where Victoria and New South Wales faced each other for the Goodall Cup in a best-of-three style tournament. The series ended with a tie, making this the second time that the Goodall Cup was not awarded to a winning team, rather it was retained by the previous years champion team. This series also saw a record attendance of 5000 spectators for the final game of the series.\n5 August 1946 was the second game in the inter state series between New South Wales and Victoria, where Victoria defeated New South Wales 2-1\n<br> \nThe goals were scored by\n<br> \nNew South Wales – Thorpe ; Victoria – Nichol, Massina\n\n7 August 1946 was the third game of the interstate ice hockey series for the Goodall Cup between Victoria and New South Wales held at the St. Moritz Ice Rink. The night saw a record crowd of 5000 spectators fill the venue to watch the thrilling final end in a 2-2 tie.\n<br> \nThe goals were scored by\n<br> \nNew South Wales – Jim Brown, F. Terger ; Victoria – Nichol (2)\n\nThe proprietors of the St. Moritz rink granted ice time to the Victorian Ice Hockey Association, free of charge to run a Lightning premiership for 8 B grade teams on 9 July 1954. All proceeds for the matches would go to the hockey association for the betterment and growth of the sport in Victoria.\n\n\n"}

It was awarded a CableACE Award in 1984 for Best Dramatic Film. The film stars Roy Scheider as Billy Young, an ageing baseball player for the Detroit Tigers, and Justin Henry as Alex, a young fan who believes in him. \"Tiger Town\" originally aired October 9, 1983 on the Disney Channel.\n\nThe film was written and directed by Detroit native Alan Shapiro and executive produced by Susan B. Landau. It was subsequently aired on ABC's \"Disney Sunday Movie\", and had a limited theatrical release in the Detroit area in June 1984, the same year the Tigers won the World Series at home against the San Diego Padres.\n\nMost of the film was shot on location at Tiger Stadium and in the city of Detroit. One notable goof in the film shows Alex racing his bicycle across a bridge over the Detroit River on the way to the stadium. The bridge is the one leading from the Detroit mainland to Belle Isle Park, an island park where there is no residential area.\n\nAlex (Henry) and his father (Ron McLarty) are devoted Detroit Tigers fans, even now as they are struggling. Alex's favorite player is aging star Billy Young (Scheider), who is having a sub-par season, his last before retiring.\n\nAlex's father dies unexpectedly, but not before he tells Alex that he should always believe. Consequently, Alex decides to visit every Tiger home game. Every time Young comes to the plate, Alex closes his eyes and wishes hard, and Young ends up hitting a home run. Thanks to Young's rejuvenated play, the Tigers start winning again.\n\nBut there is a price. Alex, who now believes that if he doesn't go to the games, the team will lose (explaining the Tigers' pitiful road trips); finds himself the subject of ridicule by classmates, since he often sneaks out of school early to watch the Tigers play. Nevertheless, thanks to Billy Young, the Tigers claw their way back into the pennant race. The final game of the season, against the Baltimore Orioles, would decide the pennant.\n\nAlex has his ticket and school lets out early so kids can watch the game, but as Alex leaves school, he is detained by a gang of bullies who take his ticket and his money. Only when Alex gets his principal's attention is he released and forced to run all the way to Tiger Stadium. Bribing a little girl for her bike and hanging onto the back of a city bus gets Alex to the stadium in time for the ninth inning, where Young is up and the Tigers are trailing. Young makes contact with the ball just as Alex gets to the front of the stadium aisle, and Young ends up clearing the bases, giving the Tigers the pennant.\n\nSeveral Detroit broadcasters and celebrities appear as themselves in the movie. Tiger manager Sparky Anderson, who was managing the team in real life, appears frequently in the movie. Mary Wilson, a former Supreme, sings the national anthem before the final game. Also appearing are Ernie Harwell, the legendary play-by-play radio voice of the Tigers; Ray Lane, as Ernie's partner; and Al Ackerman as a TV sportscaster. Harwell and Lane were paired in the radio booth calling games on WJR radio from 1967 to 1972. Ackerman was a sports anchor for Detroit's WXYZ-TV and WDIV-TV in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n"}

It was given to the town of Sevenoaks in Kent in 1773 by John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset (1745 – 1799) and owner of nearby Knole House. The land is thought to have possibly been used as a vineyard for the Archbishops of Canterbury.\n\nSeven oak trees were planted on the northern edge of the ground in 1902 to mark the coronation of King Edward VII. Six were blown down in the Great Storm of 1987. In December 1987, seven new oaks were planted to replace those lost in the storm.\n\nSevenoaks Vine Cricket Club and Sevenoaks Hockey Club, both sections of the Sevenoaks Vine Club, play on the ground which is owned by Sevenoaks Town Council. It is located to the north of Sevenoaks town centre alongside the A225 Dartford Road.\n\nSevenoaks Vine Cricket Club pay a rent of 1 peppercorn per year for the use of the ground, the archetypal peppercorn rent, but pay for the upkeep of The Vine even though it is common ground. The cricket pavilion, which is a Grade II listed building built in 1850, is rented separately by the Sevenoaks Vine Club. In keeping with tradition, the club pay Lord Sackville one cricket ball on 21 July each year. In practice this ceremony happens every year on the Wednesday of cricket week, which is the second week in July. \n\nA bandstand was built next to the pavilion in 1894 and the ground is overlooked by a number of residential properties, one of which, Vine Cottage, is contemporary with the establishment of the ground. The pavilion was renovated in 1934.\n\nThe Vine is one of the oldest cricket venues in the world. Its earliest known use was for a match between a Kent team organised by Lord John Sackville against one from Sussex on Friday 6 September 1734, a game which Kent won. A fixture was played to mark the bicentenary of the occasion in 1934.\n\nSevenoaks Vine was a venue for top class cricket matches in the 18th century and is notable for being the first place in England where cricket was played with three stumps rather than two. A total of 24 matches which were given retrospective first-class cricket status were played on the ground between 1773 and 1829. These include nine matches between Hampshire sides and England and 11 matches featuring Kent sides as the home team.\n\nThe first recorded century in any form of cricket was scored on the ground in 1769, John Minshull scoring 107 runs for a Duke of Dorset's XI against Wrotham. Minshull, a professional employed as a gardener by John Sackville, went on to be the first player known to be given out hit wicket, again at The Vine, in 1773. \n\nThe world record for the highest known individual score in a top-class match was twice established at the Vine. First Joseph Miller, playing for a Kent team against one from Hampshire in August 1774, made 95 runs out of 240 and enabled Kent to win by an innings and 35 runs. Then, in June 1777, came one of the most significant innings of cricket's early history when James Aylward scored a record 167 for a Hampshire side against an England XI. In a contemporary report, it is stated that: \"Aylward went in at 5 o’clock on Wednesday afternoon, and was not out till after three on Friday\". Hampshire won by an innings and 168 runs in one of the first matches to use three stumps rather than two. Aylward's score was not surpassed until 1820. \n\nThe last use of the Vine for a top-class match was in 1829. The Vine was used by Kent County Cricket Club's Second XI for three Minor Counties Championship matches between 1952 and 1958 and by Kent Women between 1949 and 1973. The ground was not used for county matches by Kent County Cricket Club as it could not be enclosed due to its status as common land.\n\nThe ground is the home venue of Sevenoaks Vine who play in the Kent Cricket League.\n"}
