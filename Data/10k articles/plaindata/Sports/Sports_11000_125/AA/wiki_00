The course is mainly played by diplomatic staff.\n\nIn 2004, Koryo Tours hosted the Pyongyang Friendship Golf Tournament. It was a 9-hole event played by 8 competitors.\n\nIn January 2011, North Korea announced that they would host the first-ever fully fledged 18-hole international affair. In conjunction with UK travel agency Lupine Travel the DPRK Golf Open was launched.\n\nThe first event took place over just one day in April 2011. The tournament was played in Callaway format.

It is the home field of the University of Virginia Cavaliers college baseball team. The stadium has a capacity of 5,074 and opened in 2002. It is named after former Virginia Student Aid Foundation executive director Ted Davenport.\n\nOn February 16, 2002, the University of Virginia baseball program defeated the Bucknell Bison 10-3 in the first ever contest played at the brand new UVA Baseball Stadium. Virginia opened the door on its new multimillion-dollar facility for the 2002 season.\n\nThe UVA Baseball Stadium has been through a series of improvements over its tenure as the home to the Virginia Cavaliers, but none like the upgrades and renovations that have taken place in recent years.\n\nImprovements to the stadium include: a canopied grandstand with 1,500 seats; an additional 500 seats and a grass hillside to provide more seating; six sky boxes for lease by fans and corporate sponsors; stadium lights; new dugouts for the home and visiting teams; an on-site locker room and club house; a new press box, and a new concession area.\n\nRepresenting a major athletic facility improvement, the University of Virginia installed a new grass playing surface at the then UVA Baseball Field in 1998. The Bermuda grass playing surface - known as Davenport Field - was dedicated on Saturday, April 13, 2002 during Virginia's second contest of a three-game series against the Wake Forest Demon Deacons.\n\nFollowing the 2005 season, the left field wall was shortened and moved inward to decrease the distance down the line by 17 feet. The right field was not adjusted as the stadium dimensions became asymmetrical for 2006.\n\nFollowing the 2006 season, a new scoreboard featuring a video system similar to the ones at the John Paul Jones Arena and Klockner Stadium was installed at Davenport Field. The right field wall was adjusted in association with the project, resulting in a return to symmetrical field dimensions for 2007.\n\nPrior to the 2010 season, a new set of facilities under the stadium were constructed, including an on-site visitors' clubhouse, umpire room, coaches' office. A hall of fame dedicated to baseball will also be constructed in the same space.\n\nDuring the 2010 season, the seating capacity of Davenport Field was progressively increased with the addition of 3 sets of temporary bleachers. This expanded the facility's official capacity from 3,600 to 4,825, with the final addition occurring prior to the school's final ACC series at home versus North Carolina.\n\nPrior to the May 13, 2011, series versus Miami, 249 General Admission seats were added behind the right field wall increasing the stadium's capacity to 5,074.\n\nPrior to the 2013 season, 6 grandstand sections with aluminum bleacher seating were converted to chairback seating, resulting in a reduction of stadium capacity to 4,980.\n\nA new club seating area called the Clubhouse was added to Davenport Field prior to the 2014 season. Located in left-center field, the Clubhouse includes an indoor, climate-controlled area with a cash bar, seating and TVs as well as 65 outdoor chairback seats.\n\nDavenport Field was expanded during the 2017 offseason to include a new grand entry in right field, an extended concourse with permanent chair back seats along the third base line, a field-level club area with seating for up to 140 fans, and new concessions, merchandise, and restroom facilities. The newly renovated stadium includes new areas for player training and development, a new pitching development center, and new offices for the coaches. The new official capacity is approximately 5,500. Prior to the February 21, 2018 home opener against VMI, the university announced that following a donation, the official stadium name would change to Davenport Field and Disharoon Park.\n\nThe new ballpark has enabled Virginia to schedule games against nationally prominent teams that previously would have been played on the road. \"This will increase the opportunity for television game coverage,\" said Craig Littlepage, UVA athletic director. \"Adding stadium lighting will allow our team to play or practice at night and thus miss fewer classes. In addition, the facility will become a community asset, offering a potential venue for high school tournaments and adult-league games.\"\n\nThe field was named in honor of Thomas \"Ted\" Edward Davenport who served the University of Virginia as Executive Director and Secretary/Treasurer of the Virginia Student Aid Foundation (VSAF) from 1958 until 1988. He was a dear friend and avid fan of the university until his death in 2001. A 1953 graduate of the Curry School of Education, Davenport was instrumental in increasing the donations and donors to the annual fund and leading capital funding efforts for the athletics program during his tenure. He served the university in several capacities including head baseball coach and head golf coach.\n\nIn 2013, the Cavaliers ranked 16th among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 3,189 per home game.\n\n\n"}

In 2006, the organisation announced their intention to join the Asian Cricket Council, and were originally included in the draw for the ACC Trophy, although their membership of the ACC was rejected and they did not take part in the tournament.\n\nThe Indonesian national team made its international debut in 2002, at a tournament in Perth, Australia, that also included Japan and South Korea. The team's first ICC event was the 2005 EAP Cup in Vanuatu, where it placed fifth out of six teams. Indonesia has since regularly participated in EAP regional tournaments. At 2014 EAP Championship, the most recent such event, Indonesia placed seventh out of eight teams, in front of only the Cook Islands.\n\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Indonesia and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\n\nSince the Indonesian Cricket Foundation (now Cricket Indonesia) was formed in 2000, Indonesia have played in several regional tournaments in the East Asia-Pacific region.

{"id": "11605980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11605980", "title": "Infield shift", "text": "Infield shift\n\nThe infield shift is a generic term used in baseball to describe a defensive realignment from the standard positions to blanket one side of the field or another. Used primarily against left-handed batters, it is designed to protect against base hits pulled hard into the gaps between the fielders on one side. \n\nOriginally called the \"Boudreau\" or \"Williams\" shift, the strategy is often associated with Ted Williams, but it was actually first employed against Cy Williams during the 1920s. It was later used against Ted Williams during the 1946 World Series between the Red Sox and the Cardinals as a defensive gimmick by St. Louis manager Eddie Dyer to psych out and hopefully contain Boston slugger Williams. It was devised by Cleveland Indians manager Lou Boudreau on a blackboard between games of a doubleheader in July 1946 to halt Williams' hot hitting. \"I always considered The Boudreau Shift a psychological, rather than a tactical victory,\" wrote Lou Boudreau in his book, \"Player-Manager\". The shift has been employed since then to thwart extreme pull hitters (mostly lefties), such as Barry Bonds, Ryan Howard, Jason Giambi, David Ortiz, and Mark Teixeira.\n\nTypically the third baseman moves to the left where the shortstop plays; the shortstop plays to the right of second; the second baseman plays between first and second and usually on the right field grass; the center fielder plays right-center; and the first baseman and right fielder hug the foul line. Sometimes the third baseman, rather than the shortstop, will play to the right of second, allowing the shortstop (usually the team's best infielder) to remain near their usual position. While this is the most common type of defensive shift seen in baseball, there are numerous variations that can be implemented according to the hitting ability of the batter. For example, an effective defensive shift against Joe Mauer would have the infield shifted for a pull-happy left hander, and the outfield shifted for a pull-happy right-hander, due to Mauer's tendency to pull nearly all of his groundballs, and hit nearly all of his flyballs to the opposite field.\n\nWith the infield shift becoming more common in recent years, the tactic's drawbacks have become more apparent. \n\nIn such a case, it is necessary for either the pitcher or catcher to cover third to prevent two steals by one player on the same play if the steal of second is successful, with the player not covering third covering home plate.\n\n\n\n\"Who’s on Third?

O'Harra (who also decided where the stadium should be), and field is named after two alumni boosters, George & Nancy Dunham.\n\nThe stadium is noted for being one-of-a-kind in its design, consisting of standard bleacher and box seating to one side and a three-tiered terrace on the opposite side, consisting of 250 paved parking spots allowing spectators to tailgate and watch games from their vehicles. A track also encircles the field, allowing its use for track and field events.\n\nIn 1930, the School of Mines obtained an area southeast of SDSM&T campus that was previous used as a garbage dump and feeding area for swine, based on suggestions from landscape artist Phelps Myman. That year's pledges to Sigma Tau were then tasked with designing the field and stadium. President O’Harra declared a holiday for students on May 18, 1931, allowing the student body to come and level the field \"en masse\", in preparation for proper construction. Work between 1932 until its completion in 1938 was done by a mixture of unskilled workers from the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and skilled laborers paid by donations collected by the school's alumni association.\n\nWork was completed and the stadium dedicated on September 16, 1938; the Hardrocker's first home game on that day O'Harra was a 18–7 victory over the South Dakota State Jackrabbits. The Hardrockers finished the season 8–0 (after a forfeit by Yankton College) and won that year's conference championship.\n\nThe stadium underwent $1,750,000 worth of expansion and modernization in later years through support by various state, city, county, and school entities. The field was named Dunham Field in 2004. A further $2.5 million in renovations to O'Harra were proposed in September 2016 and slated for Summer 2017.\n"}

The lead block kicks out the end man on the line of scrimmage, and another offensive player usually blocks the linebacker. It can be useful in short yardage situations, and with large backs.\n\nThe most simple form of this play has the strong side offensive lineman step towards the ball and block any defender inside of him. The fullback will kick out the end man to create the running lane for the ball carrier. The Maryland I used the 2nd back to lead through the hole and block the linebacker. More complicated versions of the play have pulling guards block the linebacker or combination blocks by a tight-end and tackle to create the hole and block the linebacker.\n\nThe off-tackle play is a key feature of the single wing offense.\n"}

The existing Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 required that a shellfish farmer seeking a Several Order to allow them to control an area of seabed on which to farm shellfish frequently encountered opposition from fishermen who fish in the area to be covered by the Order.

The first Shootboxing event took place on September 1, 1985.\n\nSome mixed martial artists such as Hayato Sakurai began their careers in Shootboxing. Shootboxing has also drawn fighters who became famous in other promotions such as Jens Pulver. Many K-1 World MAX stars also either debuted in Shootboxing or have fought for Shootboxing in the past, including Andy Souwer, Albert Kraus, and Buakaw Por. Pramuk.\n\nS-Cup, the Shoot Boxing World Cup, is the 8 man single elimination World Tournament generally held once every 2 years since 1995.\nGirls S-Cup, is the 8 woman single elimination World Tournament generally held once every year since 2009.\nProfessional shoot boxing matches fall into one of two classes, Expert class and Freshman class. The length of an Expert class match is five rounds of three minutes each, followed by one or two extra rounds of three minutes each in the event of a tie. The interval between rounds is one minute.\n\nThe length of a Freshman class match is three rounds of three minutes each, followed by one or two three-minute rounds in the event of a tie. The interval between rounds is also one minute.\n\nProfessional shoot boxers are divided into weight classes as follows:\n\nSparrowweight was divided into Flyweight and Super flyweight, and Eagleweight was divided into Heavyweight and Super heavyweight since 2001.\n\nOne way to win a shoot boxing match is to knock one's opponent out. A fighter can be knocked out in different ways. If, after being knocked down, a fighter fails to stand up after a count of ten, or if, after standing up, he fails to assume a fighting stance after a count of eight, he is knocked out. The same occurs if a fighter is knocked out of the ring and fails to return before a count of twenty. A referee may also rule a fighter knocked out if the fighter shows no fighting spirit, appears unable to defend his or her self, or makes a gesture of submission.\n\nTechnical knockouts can also occur in shoot boxing, in cases where the fighter is injured, the referee rules the fighter knocked out after two knockdowns in the same round, or the fighter's corner throws in the towel. A fight may also be stopped if a doctor rules that continuation would be dangerous to a fighter.\n\nIf neither a knockout nor a technical knockout occurs, the winner is determined by a decision. Fighters are graded on their effectiveness on attack and defense, their success in achieving and escaping submissions, and how close they have come to ending the match. Decisions generally produce a winner, but can result in a draw.\n\nA judgement of \"no contest\" may also be returned, if the judges suspect foul play or conclude that the fighters are not fighting sincerely.\n\nFighters are awarded points for their success in striking, throwing, and applying standing submission holds to their opponent. They are also given points for four categories of performance: number of times down, amount of damage done to opponent, number of clean hits, and aggressiveness. Fighters are graded from 1-10 in each category, with the difference of score in any one category being limited to 4 points.\n\nExtra points can be awarded at certain points in the match, when the referee makes certain calls. When a fighter performs a front or back throwing technique, the referee calls \"shoot\", denoting one of these opportunities. The other occurs when a fighter achieves a standing submission; at this point, the referee calls \"catch\".\n\nFoul play is recognized as the following ① to ⑬. After a warning, the fighter will receive a point deduction for further infractions. If the same fighter commits another foul, another point is deducted, and a final warning is given. If a third warning is given to the same fighter, he is disqualified and loses the fight.\nIf the referee feels that it was not a flagrant foul, he may allow the fight to continue.\nWhen either fighter receives a cut from a headbutt, the fighter that made the cut receives a point deduction, even if the headbutt was accidental.\nIf the referee decides that the headbutt was intentional, the fighter receives a two-point deduction.\n\"An attempt to escape attacks\" is defined as the act whose intent is to interrupt the opponent's offense or defense by grappling immediately after an attack.\n\nA fighter will be disqualified in the case of any of the following situations:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13582524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13582524", "title": "Terrace (stadium)", "text": "Terrace (stadium)\n\nA terrace or terracing in sporting terms refers to the traditional standing area of a sports stadium, particularly in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. A terrace is a series of concrete steps which are erected for spectators to stand on.\n\nIts significance carries particular importance in football where terraces were located in the areas behind the two goals as a cheaper alternative to sitting in the stands, which were traditionally located at the sides of the field. Naturally standing in the terraces was much cheaper than a seat, with the result that over the decades they became the most popular spectators' area for younger working class men and teenage boys to watch the game.\n\nDue to safety concerns related to terraces, they have fallen out of favour in many places. Terraces were banned from major football grounds in England in the early 1990s, as a result of the Hillsborough disaster, and are currently not used during major tournaments, and for a long time were generally not included in new stadium designs. There is currently a growing demand for a reintroduction of terracing, based on the modern stadium designs in Germany and other European countries, dubbed \"safe standing\" areas.\n\nIn Ireland, terraces are still a common feature in gaelic football, hurling, camogie, rugby union, soccer and other sports. Terraces in Ireland were generally not subject to the same level of violence as those in the United Kingdom, nor were they subject to crowd segregation (with the exception of, occasionally, football) or the Taylor Report as British terraces were, so terraces remained a common feature in Irish stadia. Hill 16 in Croke Park is one of the most notable terraces in Ireland.\n\nTerraces have been built or refurbished in ground improvements at many stadia in recent years, including Thomond Park, Croke Park and Flancare Park (since converted to all-seater); although all new League of Ireland stands built since Flancare's redevelopment have happened to be all-seater. Also GAA stadiums have terracing including Fitzgerald Stadium and Pearse Park\n\nIn the early days of the twentieth century the terraces were simply earth banks, often built up with the rubble of construction sites. Rows of railways sleepers were laid on top to provide something solid for spectators to stand on.\n\nMost stadiums in Britain at the turn of the century had bleachers for spectators, but when a wooden bleacher style terrace at Ibrox Park collapsed in the 1902 Ibrox disaster killing many spectators during a Scotland versus England game there was an instant ban on framework supported terraces, which the government ordered must be replaced by solid earthwork supported terracing.\n\nThe earth and sleeper terraces would gradually make way for concrete terraces with metal crush barriers being erected at various points to prevent crushing. An excellent example of one such old style terrace can be found at Cathkin Park in Glasgow, an abandoned football stadium, which was home to Third Lanark.\n\nThe terraces were hugely popular in England, particularly from the 1920s to the 1980s, and their working class links led them to be given affectionate names by the fans who stood on them. By far the most common name was \"Spion Kop\", named after the Battle of Spion Kop in the Boer War in South Africa in 1902 between Britain and the Boers. Arsenal F.C. were the first to adopt such a name but by far the most famous was the Kop at Liverpool F.C.'s Anfield Road ground. The vast majority of clubs in England and farther afield would go on to regard their most popular end of their stadium as a Kop, even if, in most cases the end had another name, for example the Holte End at Aston Villa F.C.'s Villa Park. The most notable exception to this is Everton F.C., whose close rivalry with city neighbours Liverpool has meant that neither the club nor its fans would ever refer to the ground as having a Kop section.\n\nThe advantage of terracing over seating for clubs was obvious, as many more fans could be packed in tightly into very cramped areas, and it is no coincidence that many clubs' all-time attendance records were set in the 1930s and 40s.\n\nTerraces were generally a safe, cheap and enjoyable way to watch sport, but on occasion they could be dangerous too.\n\nIn the early days the wet railway sleepers would often lead to falls, which quickly led to their replacement but much worse was to follow when thirty-three people lost their lives in 1946 when an overcrowded terrace led to a crush at Bolton Wanderers F.C.'s Burnden Park ground. That such a disaster only occurred once during this era is amazing as it was common in those days to see a fainted fan being passed down the terraces over the heads of those packed in so they could be treated for their ill effects. But there were perhaps more advantages than disadvantages still. The ground fee was low and achievable for all, the singing and cheering was not rarely astonishing, especially where the huge covered \"Goal Stands\" existed. Like the Kop at Anfield Road, Holte End at Villa Park and North Bank Stand at Molineux Ground\n\nBy the 1970s the lower cost of travel meant it was easier for fans to have away days, or road trips and a common practice among young visiting fans was to try to \"take the terrace\". Large bodies of supporters of the visiting team would infiltrate the popular terracing of the home supporters with the result that violence often erupted. This led to crowd segregation at football grounds and also played a small part in the erection of high fencing and segregated pens within most terraces in England.\n\nThese pens became a contributing factor in the Hillsborough disaster, England's worst ever stadium disaster, when too many fans entered the central pens at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield. 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death against the perimeter fence in the resultant crush.\n\nAlthough claiming that terraces were not \"intrinsically unsafe\", the final Taylor Report into the disaster led to a recommendation that terraces be done away with at major British stadiums. Today every major British football ground is all-seater, though terracing is still found at grounds in the lower leagues. Britain's biggest remaining terraced ground is Brunton Park in Carlisle, which still has three sides of terracing.\n\nIt has been argued that terraces encourage crowd disorder. However, analysis of statistics on football related arrests and banning orders published by the UK Home Office show that in both the 2008/9 and 2009/10 seasons the rate of arrest per 100,000 supporters was higher at Football League One and Football League Two clubs with all-seated grounds than at those with terraces. Overall arrest rates for football related offences have fallen steadily from 34 per 100,000 in 1988/89 to 9 per 100,000 in 2009/10, however the trend of reducing arrests started before stadia were required to become all-seated and has continued since.\n\nIn 2011 the Scottish Premier League announced that their clubs would be given permission to introduce safe standing areas at their grounds. In 2012, Aston Villa announced they would be looking to install safe standing areas in Villa Park in time for the 2013–14 season. In that same year, Derby County became the first club from the Championship to support the introduction of safe standing areas, although the only terraced standing areas in the Championship and/or Barclays Premiership at that time could be found at London Road, home to Peterborough United. Peterborough United became the second Championship club to back the safe standing campaign through their CEO Bob Symns. Symns also signed the safe standing petition. Indeed, the club's mascot – Peter Burrow – took part in a video campaign promoting safe standing, with the video being shot at the AWD-Arena, home to Hannover 96 in Germany\n\nTerracing was introduced to American football with the inclusion of party decks with the ability to hold 35,000 people at Cowboys Stadium in the Dallas suburb of Arlington, Texas. Capacity for Dallas Cowboys games and other American football events is 80,000 seated, expandable to 111,000 with standing areas. However, it should be noted that these decks are flat, rather than steeply pitched, and are more analogous to standing-room only ticketing where obstruction is expected. The key difference is that unlike at European grounds, party decks are not considered or marketed as areas from which all spectators are afforded a view of the match at all times.\n\nMany seats in FedExField, home of the Washington Redskins, have been removed in favor of terraced party decks. These terraced, standing room only sections are similar to safe standing sections in European stadiums, though they are not marketed as such.\n\n"}
