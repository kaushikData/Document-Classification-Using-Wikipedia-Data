After a disappointing 1996–97 season, the Flames looked to newly hired coach Brian Sutter to return the Flames to the playoffs.\n\nThe off-season featured the trade of highly popular forward Gary Roberts shortly before the season began. Roberts missed the entire 1996–97 NHL season due to injury after playing only 35 games in 1995–96. Feeling that playing in the Eastern Conference with its lower travel would help aid him in his comeback, the Flames agreed to trade Roberts. He was dealt, along with starting goaltender Trevor Kidd to the Carolina Hurricanes for Andrew Cassels and Jean-Sebastien Giguere.\n\nThe season would serve as a bitter disappointment for the Flames from start to end, as the Flames would struggle to score goals all season long, ultimately finishing with the worst record in Calgary history at 26–41–15, while 67 points was the lowest in franchise history since the expansion Atlanta Flames managed just 65 in 1972–73.\n\nTheoren Fleury was named to the North American team at the 1998 NHL All Star Game, where he recorded two assists playing on a line with Wayne Gretzky and Mark Recchi. Defenceman Derek Morris was named a Rookie All Star.\n\nFleury also represented Canada at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.\n\nPrior to the start of the season, the Flames purchased the Western Hockey League's Calgary Hitmen for approximately $1.5 million. The struggling franchise was nearly destroyed by the fallout of the Graham James scandal.\n\nOn Friday, October 17, 1997, the Flames scored three short-handed goals in a 6-5 win over the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nThe Flames finished 11th in the Western Conference with just 67 points, eleven points behind the 8th place San Jose Sharks.

The Flames marched to the Calder Cup finals, defeating the St. John's Maple Leafs 3–1, the Portland Pirates 4–2, and Hartford Wolf Pack 4–1. The Flames fell to the Philadelphia Phantoms 4–2 in the finals, however. Hnat Domenichelli led the Flames with 33 goals, while Ladislav Kohn led the team with 56 points. Tyler Moss played the majority of the games in goal, leading the team with 19 wins in 39 games, while his 2.49 GAA was just behind the 2.46 posted by Jean-Sebastien Giguere in 31 games.\n\n\n"}

It is the home of Major League Soccer's Los Angeles FC. Opened on April 18, 2018, it was the first open-air stadium built in the City of Los Angeles since 1962. Constructed on the site of the former Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, it is located next to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and just south of the main campus of the University of Southern California. Los Angeles FC subleases the site from the University which has a master lease with the LA Memorial Coliseum Commission for operating and managing the Coliseum and stadium properties.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" reported on May 17, 2015 that the team chose the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena site to build a 22,000-seat state of the art stadium for the MLS in Exposition Park, costing $250 million. The group estimated the project would create 1,200 temporary construction jobs and 1,800 full-time jobs, generating $2.5 million in annual tax revenue. The environmental impact report, arena demolition, and stadium construction were expected to take three years and delay the team's debut to 2018.\n\nOn May 6, 2016, the Los Angeles City Council approved the stadium, clearing a way for the construction of the stadium.\n\nA groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 23, 2016. At the event attended by owners and construction crews, LAFC announced a 15-year, $100 million naming rights deal for the stadium with the Banc of California. Demolition of the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena began shortly after the groundbreaking and was completed by October 2016.\n\nThe first public event at the stadium was an open practice and dedication ceremony held on April 18, 2018. The club's first match was played on April 29 against Seattle Sounders FC, with the home side winning 1–0. The lone goal was scored by Laurent Ciman in stoppage time in front of a capacity crowd of 22,000.\n\nThe seating capacity of the stadium is 22,000. The stadium's seating is at 34 degrees, which makes it among the steepest in MLS. The closest seats are 12 feet from the field and all seats are within 135 feet of the field. It includes of walkways and plazas open to the public. The stadium also features press box suites with a water fountain.\n\nA northeast slice of the stadium was designed to be open to capture the downtown Los Angeles skyline and the San Gabriel Mountains. Members of the media in the angled press box have one of the best vantage points to peer through the \"keyhole\".\n\nThe roof is covered with of ETFE film. The field is of improved bermuda grass.\n\nFive percent of the stadium's parking spaces have electric vehicle charging stations and 20% electric vehicle ready infrastructure. The stadium has 440 planned parking spaces for bicycles and a bike path to the stadium as part of the My Figueroa Project. The stadium is a LEED Silver certified building.\n\nThe ground’s North End is home to the 3252 independent supporters’ union and their “safe standing” section which is among the league’s steepest at 34 degrees. The stand’s angled handrails were designed reminiscent of gripping the safety bar on a roller coaster, and for a less encumbered view. The central section of the stand is an actual removable stage — something built in to allow the stadium to play a role beyond regular MLS matchdays for concerts and events. On top of the North End is a supporter-designed bar which can only be accessed from 3252 section.\n\nThe stadium will be a part of the Downtown Sports Park and play host to some Track and Field events and both men's and women's soccer when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\nIt was announced on April 4, 2017, that the stadium would be host to Rugby Sevens tournaments. It will be the permanent home of the Grand Prix Rugby Series, the world's richest rugby sevens championship in history.\n\nBanc of California Stadium is also designed to host concerts and other musical events. It was announced on April 5, 2018, that the stadium would host the KIIS-FM Wango Tango by AT&T, a summer concert festival, on June 2, 2018.Also, Just recently it was announced that Iron Maiden will be playing there on September 14th.\n\nLAFC has stated that Banc of California will be used for local cultural events in Los Angeles's 9th District.\n\nThe Fortnite Pro-Am, an event where celebrities competed against professional Fortnite players, took place at the Banc of California Stadium on June 12, 2018.\n\n\n"}

The match was unusual in that it was abandoned because Sheffield United had only six players left on the pitch.\n\nWith eight league matches of the 2001–02 season remaining, Albion lay in third place in the First Division on 67 points, 11 points behind rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers, who occupied the second automatic promotion spot. United meanwhile were in 15th position on 50 points, safe from relegation but not threatening the playoff places.\n\nNine minutes in, United's keeper, Simon Tracey, was sent off for handling the ball outside the penalty area and denying Albion an obvious goalscoring opportunity. Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock sent on the substitute keeper, Wilko de Vogt, taking off Peter Ndlovu. The visiting WBA scored a first-half goal through Scott Dobie against the 10-man United, and added a second goal in the 62nd minute through Derek McInnes.\n\nThe match turned truly ugly in the 65th minute, when Georges Santos, whom United had just brought on seconds earlier, was sent off for a high and poorly timed two-footed lunging tackle on Andy Johnson. When Johnson was playing for Nottingham Forest the previous season, he had fractured Santos' cheekbone and seriously damaged his eye socket with a swinging elbow. The two teams then scuffled on the pitch; in the mêlée, another United substitute, Patrick Suffo, was sent off for head-butting Derek McInnes. This reduced United to eight men, with no more substitutions left. Soon after, United captain Keith Curle was fortunate to avoid a sending off after appearing to throw punches at McInnes.\n\nIn the 77th minute, WBA added a third goal, Scott Dobie tapping in from short range. Two minutes later, Michael Brown limped off for United, and Robert Ullathorne went off injured in the 82nd minute, reducing them to six men. The referee, Eddie Wolstenholme, then abandoned the game with West Brom leading 3–0. The referee would have been aware of the IFA board guideline to law 3 which states \"the minimum number of players in a team is left to the discretion of member associations. The Board is of the opinion, however, that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team\".\n\nWest Bromwich Albion manager Gary Megson stated after the match:\nWest Bromwich Albion were awarded a 3–0 win and the 3 points by the Football League. Sheffield United were fined £10,000, Patrick Suffo £3,000 plus a 6 match ban (3 for the dismissal, 3 for violent conduct), Keith Curle £500 and a 2 match ban, Georges Santos a 6 match ban (4, plus 2 for violent conduct) and Neil Warnock £300 for improper conduct towards the 4th official. Georges Santos and Patrick Suffo never played for United again.\n\nSheffield United finished the season 13th in the league, whilst West Brom were automatically promoted - the potential goal difference increase they missed in not completing the game was not crucial.\n\n"}

It is currently played by both men's and women's teams only in tournaments or once-off internationals. The women's form of the game is called shinty/camogie.\n\nIreland are the leading team in the sport, having won sixteen of the thirty international series against Scotland to date.\n\nThe rules of the composite sport are designed to allow for neither side to gain an advantage, eliminating or imposing certain restrictions. The goals are those used in hurling, with 3 points for a goal (in the net under the crossbar) and 1 point for a shot over the crossbar. A stationary ball taken straight from the ground and shot over the crossbar scores 2 points. For the 2012 International Series, a goal became worth 5 points in an effort to increase the number of goals. This was rule was abandoned for the 2013 series, in favour of the traditional model of 3 points for a goal.\n\nPlayers may not catch the ball unless they are the goalkeeper (or a defender on the line for a penalty) and this must be released within three steps. Players may not kick the ball, but can drag the ball with their foot.\n\nAlthough there is a statutory size for the ball to be used in the games, there is often a custom of using a sliotar in one half and a shinty ball in the other. Each half lasts 35 minutes.\n\nThe first games played were challenge matches between London Camanachd and London GAA in 1896 and Glasgow Cowal and Dublin Celtic in 1897 and 1898, with the first game played at Celtic Park. However, there was then a hiatus until Scottish representative teams and Irish sides took place in the 1920s. Following intermittent international games between Scotland and an all-Ireland team before the Second World War, controversy arose as the British Government put pressure upon the Camanachd Association to cease from co-operating with the Gaelic Athletic Association, disapproving of their perceived anti-British viewpoint\n\nHowever, universities in both countries kept the link going after the war and this led to a resumption of international fixtures between the two codes in the 1970s.\n\nAfter a long run of Irish successes, Scotland won four fixtures in a row from 2005 until Ireland reclaimed the title in 2009. Scotland's successes have been marred by a lack of interest from an Irish perspective. Unlike the international rules football tests between Australia and Ireland, few players from the top flight counties participate in the event—though in recent times this trend has bucked and more higher ranked Irish players have represented their nation.\n\n2007 also saw the use of compromise rules as a way of developing the Gaelic languages in Ireland and Scotland by the Columba Initiative. A team called Alba, made up of Scottish Gaelic speakers, played Míchael Breathnach CLG, from Inverin, Galway. The project was repeated in 2008. The Gaelic speakers international was played for a third time in 2010 in Portree in the Isle of Skye on 13 February 2010.\n\nThere are also Scottish/Irish women's and under-21s sides which have competed against one another.\n\nIn 2009, the first full shinty/hurling match in the United States took place between Skye Camanachd and the San Francisco Rovers.\n\nIn 2010, the fixture was played at Croke Park before the international rules football game and then a return leg was played at the Bught Park two weeks later.\n\nOn 28 April 2012 the inaugural match between the teams of Irish Defence Forces and the British Army was played at Bught Park in aid of PoppyScotland.\n\nAn international series for men, women and under 21s is played annually, with test matches rotating between venues in Scotland and Ireland. Ireland are the leading team in the series, having won 9 of 16 senior men's test matches. Camogie-Shinty is the women's version of the game.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5287116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5287116", "title": "Cricket Canada", "text": "Cricket Canada\n\nCricket Canada, known as the Canadian Cricket Association (CCA) until November 2007, is the governing body of cricket in Canada. It was established in 1892 and has its current headquarters in Toronto, Ontario. It administers the national men's and women's teams as well as several youth teams at various age levels. In addition Cricket Canada and its affiliates run several grassroots and development programs and leagues across the country. Cricket Canada is Canada's representative at the International Cricket Council and has been an associate member of that body since 1968. It is included in the ICC Americas region.\n\nCricket was once the most popular sport in Canada until the early 20th Century before it was overtaken by hockey. Cricket was so popular it was declared the national sport by Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. Cricket, today, is a popular minority sport in Canada, although it is growing. Cricket is the fastest growing sport in Canada. Canada has well over 40,000 cricketers across the nation. While Canada is not sanctioned to play Test matches, the team does take part in One Day International (ODI) matches and also in first-class games (in the ICC Intercontinental Cup) against other non-Test-playing opposition, with the rivalry against the United States being as strong in cricket as it is in other team sports. The match between these two nations is in fact the oldest international fixture in cricket, having first been played in 1844. This international fixture even outdates the Olympics by over 50 years. There are a few grounds in Canada that are sanctioned by the ICC to host official ODI's. The most famous Canadian cricketer is John Davison, who was born in Canada but raised in Australia and participated in the Cricket World Cup in 2003, 2007 and 2011. At the 2003 World Cup, Davison hit the fastest century in tournament history against the West Indies in what was ultimately a losing cause. In that World Cup he also smashed a half century at a strike rate of almost 200 against New Zealand. One year later, in the ICC Intercontinental Cup against the US, he proved the difference between the two sides taking 17 wickets for 137 runs as well as scoring 84 runs of his own. In the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, John Davison scored the second-fastest half-century against New Zealand. Canada has participated in the 1979, 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cups. Canada has traditionally had a strong Women's team. Also The Canadian Under 19 team have competed in the Under 19 World Cup on two occasions. In 2002, they were eliminated in the first round, meaning they competed in the plate competition, in which they did not win a game. They repeated this performance in the 2004 competition.\n\n2004 started badly for Canada, with a last place finish in the Six Nations Challenge in the United Arab Emirates after Canada lost all their games. They'd improved significantly by the time of the ICC Americas Championship in Bermuda, which they won. Also in 2004, Canada participated in the first ICC Intercontinental Cup, finishing as runners up to Scotland. The highlight of this tournament was the game against the US in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when John Davison recorded the best match bowling figures since Jim Laker's 19 wickets against Australia in 1956.\n\nIn 2005, Canada again finished third in the ICC Trophy, which gained them official ODI status from 2006 until the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier, as well as qualifying them for the 2007 World Cup. Their performance in the Intercontinental Cup that year was not as good as in 2004 however, as they did not make it past the first round.\n\nIn 2006, Canada put in good performances in the four-day ICC Intercontinental Cup, beating Kenya by 25 runs and Bermuda by nine wickets, but their one-day form was a complete reversal, losing three times to Bermuda and Kenya, and a further loss to Zimbabwe.\n\nIn August 2006, Canada took part in the Division 1 of the Americas Championship. They beat Argentina and longtime rivals the USA, but lost to the Cayman Islands and eventual winners Bermuda, and finished third, their worst performance so far in this tournament.\n\nIn June and July 2008, Canada hosted Bermuda for three ODIs and Intercontinental Cup matches against Bermuda and Scotland.\n\nIn August, Canada traveled to Ireland for the World Twenty20 Qualification Tournament. Canada did not qualify for the World Twenty20, finishing 5th ahead of Bermuda. The ODIs and an Intercontinental Cup match were hampered by rain.\n\nIn late summer of 2008, West Indies and Bermuda came to Canada to play One-Day Scotiabank Series with Canada. Canada defeated Bermuda, to face West Indies in the Final. West Indies captain Chris Gayle smashed his sixteenth ODI century and led his side to an easy seven-wicket victory against Canada in the finals of the Scotiabank ODI Series at King City.\n\nDuring the Scotiabank Series the talents of Rizwan Cheema were discovered – he would become the star of the first Al-Barakah T20 Canada. The tournament involved Canada, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Canada lost all three of their matches, however the loss to Zimbabwe came in a bowl-out. Sri Lanka were eventual winners, defeating Pakistan in the Final. The tournament is expected to be played annually for the next four years.\n\nIn late November 2008, Canada participated in the Americas Championship in Florida, USA. The United States, after years of disarray, pulled together and won the championship. Canada finished 3rd on Net Run Rate behind Bermuda, as their match was washed out due to rain.\n\nCanada began its innings in 2009 by planting its front foot forward.\n\nBold management decisions allowed Cricket Canada to sign seven players to central contracts in 2008 and increased ICC funding in 2009 allowed this to continue as a move designed to regularise training sessions with a core group of cricketers. For the likes of Rizwan Cheema, who had been working in a fast-food restaurant called Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits, quitting the day job to play cricket was an easy decision; others, such as investment banker Ashish Bagai, had to mull it over before signing, even with the global financial crisis raging.\n\nFollowing this, the team headed to Sri Lanka for a training camp that would forever change the face of Canadian Cricket. For the first time in its history the players were exposed to a first-class environment and they responded by dominating the opening stages of the 2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. This led to a second-place finish and an invitation to the 2011 Cricket World Cup\n\nIn late January the Canadian team embarked for Sri Lanka to play some warm-up matches ahead of the World Twenty20 Qualifiers in the UAE, which were to be followed by two ODIs and a four-day Intercontinental Cup match against Afghanistan.\nIn January 2010, Canada's u19 team also made history as they upset heavily favoured Zimbabwe in the first match of the 2010 u19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand.

Canada again made history by producing the first ever live broadcast of an associates cricket match. The production was well received and has paved the way for more such broadcasts in the future.\n\nIn February 2010 Canada participated in the 2010 ICC T20 Cricket World Cup qualification tournament in which they failed to register a win and were eliminated after the first round.\n\nIn March 2010, Cricket Canada Directors for the first time voted in president, Ranjit Saini.\n\nIn April 2010, Cricket Canada declared its inability to host the 2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, which it had committed to hosting in 2007.\n\nCanada emerged winless from an April tour of the Caribbean playing Jamaica in a 50-over and Twenty20 game, West Indies XI in a Twenty20 game and the West Indies in a One-day international.\n\nCanada's presence in the America's also let to a relationship being developed with the West Indies Cricket Board. This included an invitation from WICB for Canada to participate in the Caribbean T20 tournament. Though not winning a game the tournament was a success for Canada as a relationship was created with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. CBC webcast all of Canada's matches and had stronger viewer ratings for this.\n\nIn June 2010, Canada stamped its authority in the Americas by winning all matches at the Americas Cup tournament in Bermuda and finishing finalists with winners USA in the Americas Twenty20. Canada also played Ireland in a drawn warm-up match in the Netherlands before the start of World Cricket League Div 1 (Ireland's top-string team was playing Australia in Dublin).\n\nCanada finish the year with some energy losing the 4-day match at home to Zimbabwe and Ireland but defeating top ranked Ireland in an ODI in front of a packed house at the Toronto Cricket Club. Cricket was firmly back in the city of Toronto and the team responded.\n\nThe year closed off with the Cricket Canada summer festival taking place at Malton Cricket Club. A strong West Indies High Performance Team (containing players with test and ODI players) split their matches with Canada in two hard-fought contests.\n\nThat November, the board decided to send the team to the World Cricket Academy in India. The 4-week trip included games in 4 cities for preparation ahead of the 2011 Cricket World Cup\n\nCanada played two major tournaments in the first part of 2011, firstly the Caribbean T20 tournament. Participating for the second time in the West Indies domestic T20 competition, Canada defeated heavily favoured Hampshire before fighting Trinidad and Tobago to the last ball in the opening two matches of the tournament.\n\nFrom the West Indies, Canada traveled to Dubai splitting matches with Netherlands and Afghanistan before arriving at the 2011 Cricket World Cup. At this tournament Canada recorded great performances from skipper Ashish Bagai, Henry Osinde, Jimmy Hansra, WD Balaji Rao, Hiral Patel and others as they won only their second ever match at a Cricket World Cup. The performance was a steady one by a young Canadian team and has set the table for an exciting future. Hansra was named captain of the team following Bagai's retirement\n\nCanada finished 2011 with a string of losses in both ODI's and Intercontinental Cup Matches to Afghanistan (in Toronto) and Ireland (in Dublin). Canada finished tied for first with T&T and Afghanistan at the Etihad Airways Summer Cricket Festival (in Toronto)\n\nCanada participated in the Caribbean T20 tournament again in 2012 losing all 4 matches. Thousands of Canadian's watched the matches on Rogers Sportsnet ONE giving the team unprecedented domestic exposure.\n\nFollowing the tournament, Canada participated in the 2012 T20 Cricket World Cup Qualification Tournament in UAE. Canada finished 6th in the tournament and did not qualify for the 2012 T20 Cricket World Cup.\n\nIn April, Ravin Moorthy was elected the new president of Cricket Canada succeeding Ranjit Saini. Moorthy was joined on the board by Vimal Hardat, Amit Joshi, Charles Pais and Calvin Clarke. At this meeting Newfoundland and Labrador were admitted to the Cricket Canada family as the 10th provincial member of the organization.\n\nCanada's women's team won the ICC America's Division 1 T20 Tournament in April 2012.

Canada has advanced to the next round of qualification.\n\nCanada hired former West Indian Cricketer Gus Logie as its national head coach in May 2012.\n\nIn November 2012, Canada's men's team will travel to USA to play the United States in the K.A. Auty Cup. The trophy has been contested between Canada and USA since 1844 and it remains the world's oldest ongoing international sporting fixture\n\nCanada is one of the top six associates of ICC. Since 2008 a lot of cricket has been played in Canada involving international cricket teams from India, West Indies, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Apart from this Canada has regular schedule of competitions with other associate members. In future there is a huge scope to become an international venue for ICC and other events.\n\nCanada has hosted many India and Pakistan One day cricket matches in Toronto which were very successful in the past. Cricket Canada recently announced that it would be willing to host international games as a neutral venue if there are any situations that games cannot be conducted at any scheduled venues. This announcement came after Australia withdrew to travel Pakistan to play cricket after security concerns in Pakistan.\n\nCricket Canada has had two different names since its foundation. They are:\n\nAs well as responsibility for Canadian International sides, Cricket Canada organizes domestic inter-provincial cricket in Canada. In 2008, Cricket Canada has introduced two domestic competitions that are Scotia Shield U-19 and National T20 Championship. National T20 Championship is a Twenty20 format competition with eight domestic teams. Until 2006, the Under-18 National Tournament in Canada was called as Canada Cup. \n\nCricket Canada's competitions:\n\nThe Canadian women's cricket team made their international debut in September 2006 in a three match series of one-day games against Bermuda to decide which team would represent the Americas region in the Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Ireland in 2007.

{"id": "3870523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3870523", "title": "Izod", "text": "Izod\n\nThe Izod Corporation (officially stylized as IZOD) is a mid-range clothing company that produces dressy-casual clothing, sportswear for men, as well as footwear and accessories. It is part of PVH, forming part of its Heritage Brands division along with Van Heusen, Arrow, Warner's, Olga, and Speedo (the latter licensed in perpetuity from Speedo International in North America only). It is perhaps best known for its short-sleeved piqué polo shirt, formerly produced by Lacoste and featuring the Lacoste crocodile on the left breast, now replaced with an embroidered (or screen-printed on some golfwear) crest. One variation is the \"IZ\" patch instead of crest. Other Izod classics include the Harrington jacket G-9 model, also v-neck and cardigan sweaters. Today, the Izod brand competes most directly with the similarly-priced Chaps brand owned by Ralph Lauren Corporation, while competing more indirectly on the lower end with U.S. Polo Assn. and on the higher end with Nautica. \n\nIn the late 1930s, Vincent dePaul Draddy, an American businessman employed by David Crystal Co., needed a strong name to associate with his quality merchandise for menswear. While vacationing with his family in London, he encountered \"Jack Izod's\" tailoring boutique. Izod (himself a well-respected tailor) produced bespoke shirts and created the Windsor tie-knot for King George V, but was ready to retire, and accepted Draddy's offer to purchase the rights to his distinctive name. The \"A.J. Izod of London\" clothing company was introduced to the United States in 1938.\n\nIzod of London would become most notable for its pairing with the Lacoste shirt company from 1952 to 1993. Vincent Draddy began to license the Lacoste shirt to add prestige to the Izod line, but he could not find a market for the then-expensive $8.00 retail price (approximately ). After Draddy began giving the shirts away to his famous friends, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Bing Crosby, Daniel Platt, and John F. Kennedy, the shirts soon became popular with department stores. \"Izod of London\" became a brand known simply as \"Izod Lacoste\". While the shirts were equally Izod and Lacoste, they became abbreviated and popularized as \"Izod\" shirts (which led to the ongoing misunderstanding that the famous \"Crocodile\" is the \"Izod\" trademark).\n\nIn 1964, Bernard Lacoste took over the management of the company. Significant company growth was seen under Bernard's management. When he became president, around 300,000 Izod Lacoste products were sold annually. The Izod Lacoste brand reached its height of popularity in the US during the late 1970s and became the signature 1980s \"preppy\" wardrobe item, mentioned in \"The Official Preppy Handbook\". The company also began to introduce other products into their line including shorts, perfume, optical and sunglasses, tennis shoes, deck shoes, walking shoes, watches, and various leather goods.\n\nIn 1977, Le Tigre Clothing was founded in an attempt to directly compete with Izod Lacoste in the US market, selling a similar array of apparel, but featuring a tiger in place of the signature Lacoste crocodile. Also, during this period Izod's parent, Crystal Brands, came under the management of General Mills, and purchased the Gant U.S.A. brand.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Izod Lacoste struggled to maintain the market dominance it had enjoyed in previous decades. The initial reaction from Crystal Brands was to separate the two names and target two groups of customers at once; \"Izod\" was re-introduced as moderate pricepoint apparel in department stores, while Lacoste was renamed \"Lacoste Chemise\", and re-positioned as a luxury lifestyle brand. Eventually this tactic did not provide the financial gain Crystal had hoped and the license partnering ended in 1993. Sportloisirs S.A. purchased the Lacoste brand entirely in 1993, while Izod was sold to Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation in 1995.\n\nPVH repositioned and restored some of Izod's previous relevance while introducing a number of products lines and brands. Complete with an Izod \"crest\" logo, or patch. In addition to its sportswear, Izod designs a full range of men's suits, shirts, neckties, shoes, outerwear and fragrances, and continues to produce its famous polo shirts. Currently, within the PVH corp. the Izod branded shirt has become part of the biggest shirt company in the United States.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2007, PVH formed a licensing deal with Kellwood Company to produce Izod-branded women's clothing. Production of the women's line was brought in-house in 2007 until its discontinuation in 2015.\n\nOn January 7, 2015 parent company Phillips-Van Heusen announced that it would be closing all 120 Izod retail outlets due to an increasing competitive environment driven by more premium brands in the outlet retail channel. This move will not affect Izod's growing wholesale business to department stores and other retailers. Coinciding with the closure of the retail outlets, in 2015 the women's line was discontinued.\n\nIn Spring 2016, Izod introduced the Advantage Polo, a new take on their traditional piqué polo featuring a cotton/polyester blend with natural stretch, moisture wicking fabric, and UPF-15 sun protection. The Advantage brand was later expanded to include other products with stretch fabric such as fleece sweatshirts and button-down shirts.\n\nOn June 7, 2017, parent company PVH announced that it has reached a licensing agreement with Adjmi Apparel Group subsidiary Sports Products of America to manufacture women's sportswear, golfwear, and activewear under the Izod brand beginning February 2018, thus signifying IZOD's return to the women's clothing market.\n\nOn August 28, 2018, it was announced that PVH would expand the Izod brand to Europe starting with the Fall/Winter 2018 collection, initially in Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia. PVH claims the launch of the Izod brand should fill in the void between fast-fashion labels and premium American brands.\n\nSince Izod's first brand, \"Izod\", was launched in 1938, it has grown considerably to include a variety of essential, performance, and luxury brands.\n\n\n\nThe former Continental Airlines Arena, in New Jersey, United States was renamed the Izod Center as of October 31, 2007, the National Basketball Association's New Jersey Nets' season opener. The company paid $1.4 million per annum for the naming rights during the first two years of the agreement, while the Nets remained tenants, which dropped to $750,000 per year for the balance of the five-year deal.\n\nIn 2009, Izod became the official apparel provider of the IndyCar Series and Firestone Indy Lights Series. Izod produces T-shirts, polos, pullovers, hats, and umbrellas for league and team officials and the general public.\n\nIn 2010 Izod became the official title sponsor of the Izod IndyCar Series, a deal worth $10 million a year for 5 years. Izod discontinued its sponsorship in 2014.\n\nIn fall 2016 leading up to the 2016 United States Presidential Election, Izod partnered with Internet sensation Ken Bone, who became notable for his red Izod sweater.\n\nIn spring 2017 and again in spring 2018, Izod has partnered with American tennis duo the Bryan brothers to promote the spring/summer collections.\n\nIn fall 2018, Izod partnered with Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Saturday Night Live comedian Colin Jost to promote the fall/winter 2018 collection; this ad campaign became notable for poking fun at advertising clichés in menswear.\n\n\n"}

Aldershot had been a small village until 1853, but was transformed following the purchase of 25,000 acres of land by the War Office for military training. Over the following two decades Aldershot was transformed into a garrison town, by 1874 a number of cricket grounds, including the Officers Club Services Ground, had been constructed for use by the various regiments garrisoned there.\n\nThe first recorded match to have been played there was in 1861 between the Knickerbockers and I Zingari. Over the coming decade the ground was used by the Aldershot Division in matches primarily against I Zingari and the Marylebone Cricket Club, though not exclusively as some matches were against other parts of the armed forces. A pavilion was built in 1887. Hampshire first played first-class cricket there in the 1905 County Championship against Surrey, with Hampshire losing this match by 7 wickets. Hampshire used the ground twice more as a venue before World War I, playing Surrey in 1906 and Somerset in 1910. This season also saw its first-class use by an armed services team, when a combined Army and Navy team played a combined Oxford and Cambridge Universities team, which marked the final first-class match played there before World War I. First-class cricket did not return immediately after the war, the first match of note came in May 1932 when the Army played the touring Indians in a two-day non-first-class match, which was abandoned without a ball bowled. Later that year in June, first-class cricket returned to the ground when the Army played the touring South Americans, which the Army won by 5 wickets. \n\nThe following season the Army played another first-class match against the touring West Indians, which ended in a draw. Of note was the Army's opening partnership of 286 in their first-innings between Reginald Hudson and Cyril Hamilton. This was the final first-class match held there before World War II, despite visits from the touring Australians in 1934 and 1938, and from the West Indians in 1939, none of which were rated first-class. A new pavilion was constructed to replace the original in 1936 and was opened by General Sir John Francis Gathorne-Hardy.\n\nMinor matches between various armed services teams and the Oxford University Authentics were played during the war. Following the end of the war, Hampshire returned to playing first-class cricket at the ground, playing two matches in 1948 against Cambridge University, which was drawn, and the Combined Services, which Hampshire won by an innings and 60 runs. These matches were the last first-class matches Hampshire would play there. First-class cricket wouldn't return until 1964, when the final first-class held there was played between the Combined Services and Oxford University. Both the Army and the Combined Services continued to play at the ground after this, doing so to this day. More recently, a Women's Twenty20 International was played there in 2011 between India Women and New Zealand Women, which India Women won by 3 wickets.\n\n\n\n"}

He also represented various All-England teams. Newland made 26 known appearances from 1741 to 1751: 18 in first-class and 8 in single wicket matches.\n\nBorn 1713, Slindon, Sussex, two of his brothers, John (born 1717) and Adam (born 1719), played for Slindon but little is known of them apart from what appears in the match reports. The Newland brothers were the uncles of Richard Nyren, who later became the team captain at Hambledon. Their sister Susan married Richard Nyren senior of Eartham, which is near Slindon.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of the Newland brothers is in a letter dated Thursday 9 July 1741 from the Duchess of Richmond to her husband. She mentions a conversation with John Newland re a Slindon v East Dean match a week earlier at Long Down, near Eartham, Sussex.\n\nIn the 1740s, Richard Newland was arguably \"the most famous player in England\". He was a batting all-rounder and the earliest known left-handed player in cricket history. His bowling style and pace are unknown but, like all bowlers during his career, he used the underarm style. He excelled at both single wicket and the eleven-a-side game.\n\nNewland's career must have begun in the 1730s but there is no mention of him in the sources during that decade. He relied for his opportunities on the 2nd Duke of Richmond, who patronised the Slindon team which eventually became representative of Sussex as a county. This was emphasised in a noted match against Surrey at Merrow Down in September 1741 when, according to Richmond's letters, \"poor little Slyndon\" beat Surrey \"almost in 1 innings\".\n\nThere are references in 1742 to \"the Sussex Man from Slending\" and \"the noted bowler from Slendon\", although it is not certain that Richard Newland was one or both of these great players. At the end of the 1742 season, Slindon played two matches against London at the Artillery Ground but lost them both, the second by a huge margin. In the first, several wagers were laid that one Slindon batsman, almost certainly Richard Newland, would obtain forty runs from his own bat – a feat he failed to perform.\n\nIn July 1743, the six players in a threes match between All-England and Kent at the Artillery Ground were stated to be \"the best in England\". Newland captained All-England, but Kent won by 2 runs before a crowd estimated at 10,000.\n\nBy 1744, Newland had begun a rivalry with Robert Colchin (\"aka\" Long Robin), who organised a number of games between his own team and one picked by Newland. Slindon defeated London in June 1744 by 55 runs, its team including Newland, his brother Adam and two other noted Sussex players Aburrow and Ridgeway. However, the team contained given men including the great Addington player Joe Harris. The match is now famous because Richmond created what has become the world's oldest surviving scorecard.\n\nTwo weeks later, Newland played for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. In \"Cricket, An Heroic Poem\" (1745) by James Love, which commemorated the match, Newland is described as \"the champion\", a sobriquet later applied to W G Grace. Kent captain Lord John Sackville is reported to have held a remarkable catch in the second innings to dismiss Newland, who was the top scorer in the match with 18* and 15.\n\nAfter Slindon beat London again in September 1744, Richmond issued the audacious \"Slindon Challenge\" to play \"any parish in England\". The only teams to accept were Addington, which featured Tom Faulkner and the Harris brothers, and Bromley, famous for Colchin, Durling and the Bryant brothers. Sadly, details of the two challenge matches are lost. It is believed they were both rained off.\n\nThere are few mentions of Slindon in 1745 or 1746 and Newland can be found playing for All-England or leading his own team, usually in opposition to Colchin's team. In July 1745, he scored what was then a massive 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. It is not absolutely certain that he did this in one innings and it may have been his match total but, giving him the benefit of the doubt, it is the highest individual innings recorded during cricket's pioneering period (i.e., to 1763).\n\nBy 1747, single wicket had superseded the 11-a-side version as the most popular form of cricket and the 1748 season was the halcyon days of single wicket. Richmond made the most of it and his Slindon fives and threes were a regular feature of the great matches at the Artillery Ground. However, Newland did not always captain his team in 1747. There was a threes match in September in which he was again opposed by his rival Colchin, but the captaincy of his side had been given to Stephen Dingate, who was a regular fixture in Richmond's teams at this time. This could be evidence that Newland was past his best. In July 1747, he seems to be reconciled with Colchin because for the first time they played on the same side but, significantly, it was Long Robin's XI that Newland was playing for. In 1749, Newland was a member of an All-England team captained by Colchin.\n\nNewland's last known appearances were in 1751, the year after Colchin and then Richmond had died. He played in two matches for All-England against Kent and was on the winning team both times. Now 38, it can be assumed that, like Sussex cricket in general after the death of Richmond, he faded from the scene. It is likely that he retired to Slindon where he farmed his land and taught his nephew Richard Nyren to play cricket. He died in 1778.\n\n"}
{"id": "1996030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1996030", "title": "Romantic chess", "text": "Romantic chess\n\nRomantic chess was the style of chess prevalent from the late 15th century until the 1880s. Chess games of this period emphasized more on quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning. The Romantic era of play was followed by the Scientific, Hypermodern, and New Dynamism eras. Games during this era generally consisted of 1.e4 openings such as the King's Gambit and Giuoco Piano. Queen side pawn openings were not popular and seldom played. The Romantic era is generally considered to have ended with the 1873 Vienna tournament where Wilhelm Steinitz popularized and the . This domination ushered in a new age of chess known as the \"Modern\", or Classical school, which would last until the 1930s when hypermodernism began to become popular.\n\nThe Romantic era is generally considered to have begun with Alexander McDonnell and Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais, the two dominant chess players in the 1830s. The 1840s was dominated by Howard Staunton, and other leading players of the era included Adolf Anderssen, Daniel Harrwitz, Henry Bird, Louis Paulsen, and Paul Morphy.\n\nDespite the Romantic era's reputation for dashing tactical play and combinations, positional play and closed games were not at all unknown during this time; they featured prominently in the London tournament of 1851, widely considered the first true chess tournament. Paul Morphy often complained about \"dull chess\" and criticized the Sicilian Defense and queen pawn openings for leading to this sort of game. Morphy included a stipulation in his matches that at least half the games had to begin with a 1.e4 e5 opening.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Nazi Germany co-opted chess as a political tool and to that end circulated propaganda alleging that the age of Romantic chess, dominated by dashing Aryan players such as Morphy and Anderssen, had been derailed by \"cowardly, stingy\" positional chess exemplified by Jewish players like Steinitz, Emanuel Lasker, and others.\n\nThe Romantic era in the arts (notably classical music and poetry) was roughly analogous to the chess world. Existing as time contemporaries with each other, the arts were focused on emotional expression more than technical mastery. This would come to an end towards the end of the 19th century as evolution in the arts (Impressionist music and Symbolist poetry) aligned closely time-wise with Steinitz' emergence as the new stylistic force in the chess world. Some notable chess masters have argued that chess is an art form in addition to a science.\n\n"}

Loosely based upon William Brashler's novel of the same name, it starred Billy Dee Williams, James Earl Jones and Richard Pryor. Directed by John Badham, the movie was produced by Berry Gordy for Motown Productions and Rob Cohen for Universal Pictures, and released by Universal on July 16, 1976.\n\nThe film was a box office success, grossing $33 million on a $9 million budget. The film received a good reception and has gained a cult following.\n\nTired of being treated like a slave by team owner Sallison Potter (Ted Ross), charismatic star pitcher Bingo Long (Billy Dee Williams) steals a bunch of Negro League players away from their teams, including catcher/slugger Leon Carter (James Earl Jones) and Charlie Snow (Richard Pryor), a player forever scheming to break into the segregated Major League Baseball of the 1930s by masquerading as first a Cuban (\"Carlos Nevada\"), then a Native American (\"Chief Takahoma\"). They take to the road, barnstorming through small Midwestern towns, playing the local teams to make ends meet. One of the opposing players, 'Esquire' Joe Calloway (Stan Shaw), is so good that they recruit him.\n\nBingo's team becomes so outlandishly entertaining and successful, it begins to cut into the attendance of the established Negro League teams. Finally, Bingo's nemesis Potter is forced to propose a winner-take-all game: if Bingo's team can beat a bunch of all-stars, it can join the league, but if it loses, the players will return to their old teams. Potter has two of his goons kidnap Leon prior to the game as insurance, but he escapes and is key to his side's victory.\n\nAs it turns out, there is a Major League scout in the audience. After the game, he offers Esquire Joe the chance to break the color barrier; with Bingo's blessing, he accepts. Leon glumly foresees the decline of the Negro League as more players follow Esquire Joe's lead, but Bingo, ever the optimist, cheers him up by describing the wild promotional stunts he intends to stage to bring in the paying customers.\n\n\nSome characters and situations are loosely based upon real-life people and incidents. Badham grew up in Birmingham, Alabama and was familiar with the Birmingham Black Barons, who shared Rickwood Field with the white Birmingham Barons.\n\nBingo Long is based on former Black Baron Leroy \"Satchel\" Paige. Early in his career, Paige would call in his outfield while leading in the ninth inning against an amateur or semi-pro team and strike out the side. Bingo did a similar stunt in this movie. Leon Carter is a Josh Gibson-like power hitter, even playing the same position (catcher). \"Esquire\" Joe Calloway is an amalgam of another Black Baron, Willie Mays (in personality, talent, and fielding position) and Jackie Robinson (as being signed by a white team at the film's end).\n\nThe Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings were loosely based on the Indianapolis Clowns and other barnstorming Negro baseball teams, who likewise engaged in Harlem Globetrotters-like clowning routines.\n\nLuther Williams Field in Macon, Georgia was used for filming as the Negro League ballpark. Luther Williams Field was home to the Macon Music, a minor league team in the independent South Coast League. Additional ballpark scenes were shot at Morgan Field in Macon, a Pony and Colt League Youth Baseball field, Grayson Stadium in Savannah, Georgia, home of the Savannah Sand Gnats of the Class A South Atlantic League, and Wallace Field in Crawford County, Georgia. Exterior scenes set in St. Louis residential neighborhoods were also filmed in Savannah. Scenes set in rural communities were filmed in Talbotton, Georgia and various small towns around Macon, including Monticello, Georgia. Some ballplayers were played by actual former athletes, including former members of the Indianapolis Clowns, who performed various stunts shown in the film.\n\nSteven Spielberg originally wanted to have a hand in producing the movie until the success of his film \"Jaws\" got his full attention.\n\nThe film gained positive reviews upon release, and has continued to be well received in recent years.

In the original version tennis rackets were used and the wicket consisted of six stumps. On 17 October 1902, a match was played before the MCC committee at Lord's. An eleven led by real tennis and rackets player Eustace Miles, and including Wimbledon champions Laurence and Reginald Doherty, defeated the opposition, led by Surrey batsman Bobby Abel. Miles' team led after the first innings by 73 to 18 runs and won by an innings after Abel's team made only 39 runs in the second innings. That same month the game was also played at Crystal Palace. Games were also played that year, and in 1903, at London's Queen's Club. In England interest in the game died down after a few years but it managed to gain a foothold in Australia where it was introduced during World War I. A key figure in the promotion of the game in Australia was Ettie Dodge, who was President (1919–66) of the New South Wales Women's Vigoro Association and foundation president (1932–66) of the All Australian [Vigoro] Association. Ettie's husband had met John George Grant in England. When the game was introduced to New South Wales schools in the 1920s, Dodge & Co. began selling vigoro equipment. Grant died in 1927 and bequeathed the trademark and copyright of the game to Ettie.\n\nVigoro is played on a pitch which shall be no shorter than 17.68 m [58'], which is slightly shorter in length than a cricket pitch. The balls are much lighter than those for cricket, and the bat has a different shape with a long handle resembling the shape of a paddle.\n\nThere are two teams of 12 players which will bat and field two innings each (except in the event that a team wins with an innings in hand). The aim of the game is for a team to score more runs than the opposition team.\n\nThere are no overs and the batsmen bat from one end only. Two bowlers bowl alternately and can incorporate any type of \"throwing\" action as long as the ball is released above the shoulder (i.e. not underarm).\n\nIf the ball is hit forward of the crease, the batter must run.\n\nA run is completed each time both batters safely make it to the crease at the opposite end of the pitch. Fours and sixes also apply where the batter hits the ball past the boundary markers. In addition to shots made off the bat, byes and leg-byes add to the team's score.\n\nPlayers may be dismissed by the same methods as in cricket – bowled, caught, run out, stumped, leg before wicket, hit wicket, handled ball and hit the ball twice.\n\nTeams from Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland compete annually for the All Australian Vigoro Titles. These teams compete across four divisions – State (Senior) One and Two, Veterans and Juniors.\n\nNew South Wales, Tasmania and Queensland are the only States in Australia which host local competitions.\n\nThe 2010 Australian Vigoro Titles were held in Bendigo, the first time they had been contested in Victoria.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47426", "title": "Water polo", "text": "Water polo\n\nWater polo is a competitive team sport played in the water between two teams. The game consists of four quarters in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into the opposing team's goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. Each team is made up of six field players and one goalkeeper. Except for the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles. Water polo is typically played in an all-deep pool meaning that players cannot touch the bottom.\n\nA game of water polo consists of the players swimming to move about the pool, treading water (often using the eggbeater kick technique), passing the ball and shooting at goal. Teamwork, tactical thinking and game awareness are also highly important aspects in a game of water polo. Water polo is a highly physical and demanding sport and has frequently been cited as one of the toughest sports to play.\n\nSpecial equipment for water polo includes a water polo ball, a ball which floats on the water; numbered and coloured caps; and two goals, which either float in the water or are attached to the side of the pool.\n\nThe game is thought to have originated in Scotland in the late 19th century as a sort of \"water rugby\". William Wilson is thought to have developed the game during a similar period. The game thus developed with the formation of the London Water Polo League and has since expanded, becoming widely popular in various places around the world, including Europe, the United States, Brazil, China, Canada and Australia.\n\nThe history of water polo as a team sport began as a demonstration of strength and swimming skill in late 19th century England and Scotland, where water sports and racing exhibitions were a feature of county fairs and festivals. Men's water polo was among the first team sports introduced at the modern Olympic games in 1900. Water polo is now popular in many countries around the world, notably Europe (particularly in Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Russia, Italy, Greece and Spain), the United States, Canada and Australia. The present-day game involves teams of seven players (plus up to six substitutes), with a water polo ball similar in size to a soccer ball but constructed of air-tight nylon.\n\nOne of the earliest recorded viewings of water polo was conducted at the 4th Open Air Fete of the London Swimming Club, held at the Crystal Palace, London on 15 September 1873. Another antecedent of the modern game of Water Polo was a game of water ‘handball’ played at Bournemouth on 13 July 1876. This was a game between 12 members of the Premier Rowing Club, with goals being marked by four flags placed in the water near to the midpoint of Bournemouth Pier. The game started at 6:00 pm in the evening and lasted for 15 minutes (when the ball burst) watched by a large crowd; with plans being made for play on a larger scale the following week.\n\nThe rules of water polo were originally developed in the late nineteenth century in Great Britain by William Wilson. Wilson is believed to have been the First Baths Master of the Arlington Baths Club in Glasgow. The first games of 'aquatic football' were played at the Arlington in the late 1800s (the Club was founded in 1870), with a ball constructed of India rubber. This \"water rugby\" came to be called \"water polo\" based on the English pronunciation of the Balti word for ball, \"pulu\". Early play allowed brute strength, wrestling and holding opposing players underwater to recover the ball. Players held underwater for lengthy periods usually surrendered possession. The goalie stood outside the playing area and defended the goal by jumping in on any opponent attempting to score by placing the ball on the deck.\n\nThe rules of water polo cover the play, procedures, equipment and officiating of water polo. These rules are similar throughout the world, although slight variations to the rules do occur regionally and depending on the governing body. Governing bodies of water polo include FINA, the international governing organization for the rules; the NCAA rules, which govern the rules for collegiate matches in the United States; the NFHS rules which govern the rules in high schools in the USA and the IOC rules which govern the rules at Olympic events.\n\nThere are seven players in the water from each team at one time. There are six players that play out and one goalkeeper. Unlike most common team sports, there is little positional play; field players will often fill several positions throughout the game as situations demand. These positions usually consist of a center forward, a center back, the two wing players and the two drivers. Players who are skilled in all positions of offense or defense are called utility players. Utility players tend to come off of the bench, though this is not absolute. Certain body types are more suited for particular positions, and left-handed players are especially coveted on the right-hand side of the field, allowing teams to launch two-sided attacks.\n\nThe offensive positions include: one center forward (also called a \"set\", \"hole-set\", \"center\", \"setter\", \"hole\", or \"2-meter man\", located on or near the 2-meter, roughly in the center of the goal), two wings (located on or near the 2-meter, just outside of the goal posts, respectively), two drivers (also called \"flats\", located on or near the 5-meter, roughly at the goal posts, respectively), and one \"point\" (usually just behind the 5 meter, roughly in the center of the goal, respectively), positioned farthest from the goal. The wings, drivers and point are often called the perimeter players; while the hole-set directs play. There is a typical numbering system for these positions in U.S. NCAA men's division one polo. Beginning with the offensive wing to the opposing goalie's right side is called one. The flat in a counter clockwise from one is called two. Moving along in the same direction the point player is three, the next flat is four, the final wing is five, and the hole set is called six. Additionally, the position in which a player is can give advantages based on a player's handedness, to improve a shooting or passing angle (for example, the right wing is often left handed).\n\nThe center sets up in front of the opposing team's goalie and scores the most individually (especially during lower level play where flats do not have the required strength to effectively shoot from outside or to penetrate and then pass to teammates like the point guard in basketball, or center midfield player in soccer). The center's position nearest to the goal allows explosive shots from close-range.\n\nDefensive positions are often the same, but just switched from offence to defence. For example, the centre forward or hole set, who directs the attack on offence, on defence is known as \"hole D\" (also known as set guard, hole guard, hole check, pit defence or two-metre defence), and guards the opposing team's centre forward (also called the hole). Defence can be played man-to-man or in zones, such as a 2–4 (four defenders along the goal line). It can also be played as a combination of the two in what is known as an \"M drop\" defence, in which the point defender moves away (\"sloughs off\") his man into a zone in order to better defend the centre position. In this defence, the two wing defenders split the area furthest from the goal, allowing them a clearer lane for the counter-attack if their team recovers the ball.\n\nThe goalkeeper has the main role in blocking shots against the goal as well as guiding and informing their defense of imposing threats and gaps in the defense. The goalkeeper usually begins the offensive play by passing the ball across the pool to an attacker. It is not unusual for a goalkeeper to make an assisting pass to a goal on a break away.\n\nThe goalkeeper is given several privileges above those of the other players, but only within the five-meter area in front of their own goal:\n\nIn general, a foul that would cause an ejection of a field player might bring on a five-metre shot on the goalkeeper. The goalkeeper also has one limitation that other players do not have: he cannot cross the half-distance line. Also, if a goalkeeper pushes the ball under water, the action will not be punished with a turnover like with field players, but with a penalty shot.\n\nPlayer positioning\n\nThe most basic positional set up is known as a \"3–3\", so called because there are two lines in front of the opponent's goal. Another set up, used more by professional teams, is known as an \"arc\", \"umbrella\", or \"mushroom\"; perimeter players form the shape of an arc around the goal, with the hole set as the handle or stalk. Yet another option for offensive set is called a 4–2 or double hole; there are two center forward offensive players in front of the goal. Double hole is most often used in \"man up\" situations, or when the defense has only one skilled \"hole D\", or to draw in a defender and then pass out to a perimeter player for a shot (\"kick out\").\n\nAnother, albeit less common offense, is the \"motion c\", sometimes nicknamed \"washing machine offence\", in which two \"weak-side\" (to the right of the goal for right-handed players) perimeter players set up as a wing and a flat. The remaining four players swim in square pattern in which a player swims from the point to the hole and then out to the strong side wing. The wing moves to the flat and the flat to the point. The weak side wing and flat then control the tempo of play and try to make passes into the player driving towards the centre forward who can then either shoot or pass. This form of offence is used when no dominate hole set is available, or the hole defence is too strong. It is also seen much more often in women's water polo where teams may lack a player of sufficient size or strength to set up in the centre forward. The best advantage to this system is it makes man-coverage much more difficult for the defender and allows the offence to control the game tempo better once the players are \"set up\". The main drawback is this constant motion can be very tiring as well as somewhat predictable as to where the next pass is going to go.\n\nAdvancing the ball\n\nWhen the offence takes possession of the ball, the strategy is to advance the ball down the field of play and to score a goal. Players can move the ball by throwing it to a teammate or swimming with the ball in front of them (dribbling). If an attacker uses his/her arm to push away a defending player and free up space for a pass or shot, the referee will rule a turnover and the defence will take possession of the ball. If an attacker advances inside the 2-metre line without the ball or before the ball is inside the 2-metre area, (s)he is ruled offside and the ball is turned over to the defence. This is often overlooked if the attacker is well to the side of the pool or when the ball is at the other side of the pool.\n\nSetting the ball\n\nThe key to the offence is to accurately pass (or \"set\") the ball into the centre forward or hole set, positioned directly in front of the goal (\"the hole\"). Any field player may throw the hole set a \"wet pass\". A wet pass is one that hits the water just outside the hole set's reach. A dry pass may also be used. This is where the hole set receives the ball directly in his hand and then attempts a shot at the cage. This pass is much more difficult because if the pass is not properly caught, the officials will be likely to call an offensive foul resulting in a change of ball possession. The hole set attempts to take possession of the ball [after a wet pass], to shoot at the goal, or to draw a foul from his defender. A minor foul is called if his defender (called the \"hole D\") attempts to impede movement before the hole set has possession. The referee indicates the foul with one short whistle blow and points one hand to the spot of the foul and the other hand in the direction of the attack of the team to whom the free throw has been awarded. The hole set then has a \"reasonable amount of time\" (typically about three seconds; there is no FINA rule on this issue) to re-commence play by making a free pass to one of the other players. The defensive team cannot hinder the hole set until the free throw has been taken, but the hole set cannot shoot a goal once the foul has been awarded until the ball has been played by at least one other player. If the hole set attempts a goal without the free throw, the goal is not counted and the defence takes possession of the ball, unless the shot is made outside the 5-metre line. As soon as the hole set has a free pass, the other attacking players attempt to swim (or \"drive\") away from their defenders towards the goal. The players at the flat position will attempt to set a screen (also known as a pick) for the driver. If a driver gets free from a defender, the player calls for the pass from the hole set and attempts a shot at the goal.\n\nMan-Up (5 on 6)\n\nIf a defender interferes with a free throw, holds or sinks an attacker who is not in possession or splashes water into the face of an opponent, the defensive player is excluded from the game for twenty seconds, known as a 'kick out' or an ejection. The attacking team typically positions 4 players on the 2 metre line, and 2 players on 5 metre line (4–2), passing the ball around until an open player attempts a shot. Other formations include a 3–3 (two lines of three attackers each) or arc (attackers make an arc in front of the goal and one offensive player sits in the 'hole' or 'pit' in front of the goal). The five defending players try to pressure the attackers, block shots and prevent a goal being scored for the 20 seconds while they are a player down. The other defenders can only block the ball with one hand to help the goalkeeper. The defensive player is allowed to return immediately if the offence scores, or if the defence recovers the ball before the twenty seconds expires.\n\nOn defence, the players work to regain possession of the ball and to prevent a goal in their own net. The defence attempts to knock away or steal the ball from the offense or to commit a foul in order to stop an offensive player from taking a goal shot. The defender attempts to stay between the attacker and the goal, a position known as \"inside water\".\n\nGoalkeeper\n\nEven with good backup from the rest of the defenders, stopping attacks can prove very difficult if the goalkeeper remains in the middle of the goal. The most defensible position is along a semicircular line connecting the goalposts and extending out in the centre. Depending on the ball carrier's location, the goalkeeper is positioned along that semicircle roughly a metre out of the goal to reduce the attacker's shooting angle. The goalkeeper stops using his or her hands to tread water once the opponent enters at about the 7 metre mark and starts to lift their upper body using the eggbeater technique to prepare to block the shot. Finally the goalkeeper tries to block the ball down, which is often hard for the longer reaches, but prevents an offensive rebound and second shot. As is the case with other defensive players, a goalkeeper who aggressively fouls an attacker in position to score can be charged with a penalty shot for the other team. The goalkeeper can also be ejected for twenty seconds if a major foul is committed. Also inside the five metre mark, the goalie can swing at the ball with a closed fist without being penalised.\n\nAdvantage rule\nIf an offensive player, such as the centre forward, has possession of the ball in front of the goal, the defensive player tries to steal the ball or to keep the centre from shooting or passing. If the defender cannot achieve these aims, he may commit a foul intentionally. The hole set then is given a free throw but must pass off the ball to another offensive player, rather than making a direct shot at the goal. Defensive perimeter players may also intentionally cause a minor foul and then move toward the goal, away from their attacker, who must take a free throw. This technique, called sloughing, allows the defense an opportunity to double-team the hole set and possibly steal the inbound pass. The referee may refrain from declaring a foul, if in his judgment this would give the advantage to the offender's team. This is known as the \"Advantage Rule\".\n\nWater polo is a contact sport, with little protective gear besides swim suits and caps with ear protectors and thus injuries are common. Among the most frequent serious injuries are those affecting the head and shoulders. Those induced to the head are usually caused by elbows or the ball itself, while shoulder injuries are a result of grabbing or pushing while shooting or passing. Other injuries take place underwater, such as leg and groin injuries, as many things can not be seen from above the surface and not much padding is used to protect the players.\n\nSunburn is a common minor injury in outdoor matches. The irritation of the sunburn can be restrictive because of the sheer amount of movement involved in the sport. Players will often neglect applying sunscreen as this will impair the player's ability to grip the ball and rapidly deteriorate the ball's physical grip due to the oily nature of sunscreen. Having large amounts of sunscreen on during an official match is banned by FINA and most other state/national governing bodies.\n\nInner tube water polo is a style of water polo in which players, excluding the goalkeeper, are required to float in inner tubes. By floating in an inner tube players expend less energy than traditional water polo players, not having to tread water. This allows casual players to enjoy water polo without undertaking the intense conditioning required for conventional water polo.\n\nSurf polo, another variation of water polo, is played on surfboards. First played on the beaches of Waikiki in Hawaii in the 1930s and 1940s, it is credited to Louis Kahanamoku, Duke Kahanamoku's brother.\n\nCanoe polo or kayak polo is one of the eight disciplines of canoeing pursued in the UK, known simply as \"polo\" by its aficionados. Polo combines paddling and ball handling skills with a contact team game, where tactics and positional play are as important as the speed and fitness of the individual athletes.\n\nFlippa ball is a precursor variant intended for younger and beginner players to learn the basics of polo. It is played in shallow water and permits touching the bottom of the pool. Players rotate positions after each score.\n\nLittle player equipment is needed to play water polo. Items required in water polo include:\n\nMen's water polo at the Olympics was the first team sport introduced at the 1900 games, along with cricket, rugby, football, polo (with horses), rowing and tug of war. Women's water polo became an Olympic sport at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games after political protests from the Australian women's team.\n\nOne of the most historically known matches often referred to as the \"Blood in the Water match\", was a 1956 Summer Olympics semi-final match between Hungary and the Soviet Union, played in Melbourne. As the athletes left for the games, the Hungarian revolution began, and the Soviet army crushed the uprising. The Hungarians defeated the Soviets 4–0 before the game was called off in the final minute to prevent angry Hungarians in the crowd reacting to Valentin Prokopov punching Ervin Zador.\n\nEvery 2 to 4 years since 1973, a men's Water Polo World Championship is organized within the FINA World Aquatics Championships. Women's water polo was added in 1986. A second tournament series, the FINA Water Polo World Cup, has been held every other year since 1979. In 2002, FINA organised the sport's first international league, the FINA Water Polo World League.\n\nThere is also a European Water Polo Championship that is held every other year.\n\nProfessional water polo is played in many Southern and Eastern European countries like Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Russia, Spain, etc. with the LEN Euroleague tournament played amongst the best teams.\n\nThere is also a World Club Water Polo Challenge.\n\n"}
