{"id": "28713459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28713459", "title": "2010 Honda Indy Edmonton", "text": "2010 Honda Indy Edmonton\n\nThe 2010 Honda Indy Edmonton was an IndyCar motor race held on July 25, 2010 at the Edmonton City Centre Airport, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It was the eleventh round of the 2010 IndyCar Series season, the third annual edition of the Edmonton Indy in the IndyCar Series, and the sixth anniversary running of the race (including three years on the Champ Car World Series (CCWS) schedule). The 95-lap race was won by Chip Ganassi Racing driver Scott Dixon, who started from the third position. Will Power finished second for Team Penske and Dixon's teammate Dario Franchitti came in third.\n\nPower, the defending champion of the Honda Indy Edmonton, won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying. In the race, Power maintained the first position throughout most of the event but was passed by teammate Hélio Castroneves with eighteen laps remaining. On the race's final restart on lap 92, Power attempted to reclaim the lead from Castroneves but the latter defended his position and was issued with a drive-through penalty. He chose not to take it and was demoted to tenth and the victory was awarded to Dixon.\n\nThere were four cautions and four lead changes among three different drivers during the race. It was Dixon's second win of the season, and the twenty-third of his career. The result meant Power extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 50 points over Franchitti, and 71 in front of Dixon, with six races of the season remaining.\n\nThe Honda Indy Edmonton was confirmed as a part of the Indy Racing League's (IRL) 2010 schedule for the IndyCar Series in December 2009 after Edmonton City Council voted to keep the race on the calendar despite incurring losses of $9.2 million over the previous two seasons. It would be the third consecutive year the race was held in the series, and the sixth Edmonton Indy counting the period from 2005 to 2007 when it was a Champ Car World Series (CCWS) event. It would be the second consecutive round held in Canada, following the Honda Indy Toronto the previous week. Tire supplier Firestone brought three types to tire to the race: two dry compounds (black-sidewall \"Primary\" and red-banded \"Alternate\") and grooved rain tires.\n\nPrior to the race, Team Penske driver Will Power was the points leader with 377 points, with his primary championship rival Dario Franchitti 42 behind in second and Scott Dixon third. Ryan Briscoe was fourth on 292 points, and Ryan Hunter-Reay was sixth points adrift in fifth position. Having dominated the previous running of the Indy Edmonton, Power felt he could repeat the success and believed it would be \"very competitive\" in the qualifying session and \"very tough\" in the race. With seven races remaining in the season after the race (two on road courses and four on oval tracks), Franchitti said he wanted to get back into the championship battle after he retired with a gearbox problem in the Iowa Corn Indy 250 and hoped he would perform well in Edmonton.\n\nTwo practice sessions were held on the Friday before the race: each lasted for an hour. A third session, also an hour long, took place on the Saturday morning prior to qualifying. Franchitti was fastest in the first practice session with a time of one minute and 3.0885 seconds; Dixon was second and Power third. Hélio Castroneves was fourth-fastest, ahead of Justin Wilson and Paul Tracy. Ryan Briscoe, Ryan Hunter-Reay, E. J. Viso and Takuma Sato rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was stopped twice: firstly for Milka Duno who lost control of her car and went into the turn ten tire barrier damaging her front wing, and then Bertrand Baguette spun after hitting a chicane kerb which caused to him to drive through an advertising billboard. In the second practice session, Power set the fastest time of the day with a lap of one minute and 1.6689 seconds, with his teammates Briscoe in second and Castroneves third. Franchitti recorded the fourth-quickest time; Sato was fifth and Dixon sixth. Wilson, Viso, Tracy and Tony Kanaan followed in the top ten. Three caution flags came out; Baugette crashed, Duno stalled after she spun and Tomas Scheckter slid into a tire barrier.\n\nIn the final practice session, Castroneves recorded the fastest time with a lap of one minute and 1.6642 seconds, ahead of his Team Penske teammates Power and Briscoe. Hideki Mutoh recorded the fourth-fastest time; Dixon was fifth and Tracy sixth. Wilson was seventh-fastest, Kannan eighth, Marco Andretti ninth and Sato completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Several drivers had high-speed spins without damaging their cars which triggered the caution flags to be displayed. A stoppage was caused when Tracy and Alex Tagilani both spun in the first turn; Tracy narrowly avoided a collision with Baugette who was exiting the pit lane.\n\nQualifying followed the usual road and street course system, with the field being split into two groups. All cars were split into two groups of twelve, with the fastest six from each group going through to the \"Top 12\" session. In this session, the fastest six runners progressed to the \"Firestone Fast Six\". The fastest driver in the final session claimed pole position, with the rest of the runners lining up in session order, regardless of qualifying times. (Fast Six from one to six, Top 12 from seven-twelve and Round 1 from 13–24, with Group 1 drivers occupying the odd-numbered grid positions, and Group 2 drivers occupying the even-numbered starting positions). Duno was prohibited from participating in qualifying because her practice lap times did not meet the required performance standards but was allowed to start the race. In the first group of twelve runners, Power paced the session, nearly three-tenths of a second faster than teammate Briscoe with Castroneves in third place. Other drivers to make it into the second session of qualifying were Franchitti, Wilson and Raphael Matos. The remaining twelve drivers took part in the second group, with Simona de Silvestro recording her fastest lap of the day. Hunter-Reay, Dixon, Viso, Mutoh and Scheckter were the other competitors in the top six, and thus progressed to the second round of qualifying. In the Top 12, Power set the fastest lap time, holding off teammate Castroneves and Dixon. Briscoe, Franchitti and Viso finished between fourth and sixth, and would be the other half of the drivers that progressed to the Fast Six. Power clinched his sixth pole position of the season with a time of one minute and 00.7126 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by teammate Castroneves who had the pole position until Power's lap. Chip Ganassi Racing teammates Dixon and Franchitti were third and fourth, and Briscoe took fifth ahead of Viso.\n\nThe drivers took to the track at 10:00 AM (UTC−6) for a 30-minute warm-up session. Power maintained his good performance, setting a time of one minute and 1.8397 seconds. Dixon was the second-fastest driver. Power's Team Penske teammates Castroneves and Briscoe rounded out the top four.\n\nThe race began at 4:00 p.m. local time, and was televised live in the United States on Versus. Weather conditions at the start of the race were sunny and mild with an air temperature between and a track temperature which ranged between . Power maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first turn. Duno spun off the track at the start but no caution was needed. De Silvestro passed Viso for sixth place on the same lap. At the end of the first lap, Power led Castroneves, with Dixon, Franchitti, Briscoe, de Silvestro, Viso, Hunter-Reay, Wilson and Matos rounding out the top ten. The top five drivers began to pull away from the rest of the field. On lap two, Tracy made contact with Matos' rear-end in turn two who was sent spinning into the infield grass and Matos drove cautiously to the pit lane with a flat left-rear tire. Scheckter's front wing was damaged on lap 10 for which he made a pit stop for a replacement nose cone. After starting fifteenth, Tracy drove aggressively and moved up into tenth position by the 20th lap.\n\nBriscoe passed the Chip Ganassi Racing drivers after they were held up by slower cars to move into second place on lap 29. Green-flag pit stops began four laps later. Wilson spun at the end of the backstretch while braking for turn ten on the 36th lap after his right-rear shock absorber failed and drove slowly to his pit box to repair damage to his vehicle. Danica Patrick attempted to pass Baugette around the inside on lap 39, but lost control of her car and ran wide into the infield grass section and rejoined the track in 17th without damaging her suspension. Andretti's front wing came apart on lap 46 while holding up four cars, and Scheckter ran wide as the four cars passed Andretti. The first full course caution of the event was necessitated on the following lap when Alex Lloyd spun into the grass and stalled his engine. Andretti made a pit stop for a replacement front wing during the caution. Racing resumed at the start of lap 51 with Power leading Castroneves, Briscoe and Dixon. Shortly afterward, de Silvestro was hit from behind by Viso who overheated his brakes, and went into the turn one tyre barrier, causing the second caution. Viso avoided making contact with teammate Tracy (who took avoiding action) on the same lap.\n\nViso was issued with a drive-through penalty and rejoined in tenth position. The race resumed on lap 54 with Power retaining his lead. The race's third caution was issued shortly after the restart when Kanaan made light contact with the side of Tagilani who spun. Mario Romancini was blinded by smoke that came from the incident and was hit by the recovering Tagilani. Both cars sustained heavy damage and retired but Kanaan was able to continue without apparent damage. Power led the field back up to speed at the lap-58 restart. Briscoe fell behind the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers, while Tracy moved past Hunter-Reay for sixth place. The second (and final) round of green-flag pit stops started on the 63rd lap; Tracy and Hunter-Reay made their pit stops over the next five laps in the hope a caution flag would be shown that would allow the pair to lead the race. After the pit stops, Power remained in the first position, and had the Alternate tires fitted on his car. He was ahead of Castroneves and Dixon.\n\nOn the 77th lap, Power and teammate Castroneves (on the Primary tires) encountered slower cars, and the latter took advantage of the situation which allowed him to overtake Power for the lead. Castroneves began to pull away from Power. Ten laps later, de Silvestro's car ran out of fuel and pulled over to the side of the track onto the infield grass to retire from the race which prompted the fourth (and final) caution. Racing resumed when the pace car drove into the pit lane at the start of lap 92. Power went onto the outside lane at the entrance of the first turn, and Castroneves drove left as a blocking manoeuvre. Castroneves accelerated out of the corner's exit which caused Power to run wide. Dixon took advantage of the situation and passed Power around the outside to take over second place. The move was immediately reviewed by the IndyCar chief steward and competition president Brian Barnhart, which led to Castroneves being shown a black-flag a minute later as he was deemed as having blocked Power. Castroneves was informed that he was issued with a drive-through penalty, but opted to remain on the track for the final two laps and crossed the start-finish line first on the road.\n\nBecause Castroneves had not taken his penalty, the victory was awarded to Dixon, with Power in second and Franchitti third. Briscoe was fourth, and Hunter-Reay held off Tracy to claim fifth. Moraes, Viso and Sato finished in positions seven to nine, while Castroneves was demoted to tenth. There were four cautions and four lead changes among three different drivers during the race. It was Dixon's second win of the season, and the twenty-third of his career.\n\nCastroneves was upset about the penalty and leapt from his car and yelled in anger at the flagman (looking for an explanation) and grabbed the Head of Security Charles Burns as he sought an answer. He argued that he did not change his line: \"I actually gave him room outside. When you go side by side like that with your teammate and the guy [Barnhart] has just swept ... literally, literally just takes it away from you ... it's just absurd.\" Castroneves was fined $60,000 by the IRL for \"unsportsmanlike conduct\" and was placed on probation for the rest of the season. It was later revealed by IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard that the series considered suspending Castroneves but chose not to because of his popularity with its fanbase. Castroneves later apologized for his actions but still did not agree with the penalty. Comparisons were made between Castroneves' block and his manoeuvre against Wilson in the 2008 Detroit Indy Grand Prix. Gordon Kirby of \"Motor Sport Magazine\" opined that Castroneves' move was fair and sportsmanlike and noted that several fans perceived it as \"good, hard racing\".\n\nDixon said of his victory: \"It's not a way you want to win for sure. When I win, I want to win being faster or putting a good pass on someone. But the way our season is going, I'll be taking anything at the moment.\" Second-place finisher Power said it was still a good finish for him in terms of scoring points. Tony Cotman, the circuit's design consultant, announced in February 2011 that the track would be improved and lengthened for that year. He stated that the layout of the track be moved to.the Eastern runway of the City Centre Airport in an attempt to create more excitement. The result of the alterations would be an additional of track, creating a circuit. With his second-place finish, Power extended his points lead in the standings to 50 over Franchitti and 71 ahead of Dixon. Briscoe and Hunter-Reay retained fourth and fifth positions.\n\n"}

{"id": "11883532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11883532", "title": "Black swan emblems and popular culture", "text": "Black swan emblems and popular culture\n\nThe black swan (\"Cygnus atratus\") is widely referenced in Australian culture, although the character of that importance historically diverges between the prosaic in the East and the symbolic in West. The black swan is also of spiritual significance in the traditional histories of many Australian Aboriginal peoples across southern Australia. Metaphoric references to black swans have appeared in European culture since long before the real-life discovery of \"Cygnus atratus\" in Australia in the 18th century.\n\nThe black swan is the official state emblem of Western Australia and is depicted on the flag of Western Australia, as well as being depicted on the . The symbol is used in other emblems, coins, logos, mascots and in the naming of sports teams.\n\nDaisy Bates recorded a nyoongar man called Woolberr \"last of the black swan group\" of the Nyungar people of south-western Australia in the 1920s. The website of the Premier of Western Australia refers to Nyungar lore of how the ancestors of the Nyungar people were once black swans who became men.\n\nThe Dreamtime story of the black swans tells how two brothers were turned into white swans so they could help an attack party during a raid for weapons. It is said that Wurrunna used a large gubbera, or crystal stone, to transform the men. After the raid, eaglehawks attacked the white swans and tore feathers from the birds. Crows who were enemies of the eaglehawks came to the aid of the brothers and gave the black swans their own black feathers. The black swan's red beak is said to be the blood of the attacked brothers, which stayed there forever.\n\nThe moral code embedded in Aboriginal lore is evident in a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, he wanted to take the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found that they had been changed into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as a reminder to their human relatives of the perils of pride and arrogance.\n\nThe Roman satirist Juvenal wrote in AD 82 of \"rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno\" (\"a rare bird in the lands, and very like a black swan\"). He meant something whose rarity would compare with that of a black swan, or in other words, as a black swan did not exist, neither did the supposed characteristics of the \"rare bird\" with which it was being compared. The phrase passed into several European languages as a popular proverb, including English, in which the first four words (\"a rare bird in the land\") are often used ironically. For some 1500 years, the black swan existed in the European imagination as a metaphor for that which could not exist.\nThe Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh made the first European record of sighting a black swan in 1697, when he sailed into, and named, the Swan River on the western coast of New Holland. The sighting was significant in Europe, where \"all swans are white\" had long been used as a standard example of a well-known truth. In 1726, two birds were captured near Dirk Hartog Island, north of the Swan River, and taken to Batavia (now Jakarta) as proof of their existence.\n\nGovernor Phillip, soon after establishing the convict settlement some sixty years later and away at Botany Bay on the east coast, wrote in 1789 that \"A black swan, which species, though proverbially rare in other parts of the world, is here by no means uncommon ... a very noble bird, larger than the common swan, and equally beautiful in form ... its wings were edged with white: the bill was tinged with red.\" A contemporary, Surgeon-General John White, observed in 1790, \"We found nine birds, that, whilst swimming, most perfectly resembled the rara avis of the ancients, a black swan.\"\n\nThe taking of black swans to Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries brought the birds into contact with another aspect of European mythology: the attribution of sinister relationships between the devil and black-coloured animals, such as a black cat. Black swans were considered to be a witch's familiar and often chased away or killed by superstitious folk. This may explain why black swans have never established a sizeable presence as feral animals in Europe or North America.\n\nWhile the European encounter with the black swan along Australia's west coast in the late 17th and early 18th centuries led to the shattering of an age-old metaphor, their contact on the east coast in the late 18th and early 19th centuries merely confirmed the new post-proverbial view, before turning to account for the black swan as just one more curiosity in the South to be utilised in developing the colonies.\n\nIn Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\", the sinister and seductive black swan, Odile, is contrasted with the innocent white swan, Odette.\n\nThe coat of arms of Western Australia includes a black swan as the principal charge on the shield. A black swan on a gold plate or disk has been the official badge of the state since 1876, and is shown on the flag of Western Australia. The coat of arms of Australia (1912 version) shows, in its fifth quarter, the black swan on a gold field, representing the state as one of the original states in the federation.\nAlthough the State Arms were granted in 1969, municipal heraldry had already been using the black swan symbolism since 1926, when the coat of arms of Perth were granted with a black swan as a charge in the first quarter and black swan supporters. This was followed by Northam (1953, black swan crest) and Bunbury (1959, black swan crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: Fremantle (1971, charge), Gosnells (1978, charge), Melville (1981, supporters) and Subiaco (1984, crest). All of the municipal arms granted by the Crown have included a representation of a black swan, presumably acknowledging the allegiance of each municipality to the state.\n\nIn the history of the Western Australian Government Railways - the black swan emblem occurred between the 1920s to the 1980s\n\nSeveral state authorities have also been granted arms showing a black swan: St George's College at the University of Western Australia (1964, charges), Fremantle Port Authority (1965, crest), and the University of Western Australia (1972, charges). The university had used an assumed version of these arms since 1913, and the university's student guild reaffirmed its assumption and use of a differenced version of the University Arms in 1991. Authorities with assumed arms showing a black swan include Royal Perth Hospital (1936, charge), and the University of Western Australia residential colleges of St Thomas More (charge), Currie Hall (charge) and St Catherines (charge).\n\nReligious authorities have also used representations of the black swan in their heraldic emblems. Of the two largest denominations in the state, there are the Anglican dioceses of Kalgoorlie (1956, charge) and North-West Australia (1956, charge); and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Perth (charge).\n\nThe Colony of Western Australia produced its first postage stamps in 1854, and in contrast to the usual practice within the British Empire, they featured, not a portrait of Queen Victoria, but an image of the black swan. The design of the stamp underwent several modifications over the next 48 years, until 1902, when the last design was produced, although the swan stamps continued in use until 1913, when Australian stamps superseded the colonial/state issues. The most famous of the series was the four-penny Blue Inverted Swan produced in 1855, in which the central image was printed upside down. The stamp is now an acknowledged philatelic rarity, with only fifteen known to have survived. Stamp issues in all of the other British colonies in Australasia, such as New South Wales, featured royal portraits rather than local symbols, apart from some one-off commemorative issues.\n\nBlack swans feature as emblems and decorations on most important public buildings in Western Australia. An example is the tower of the Fremantle Town Hall.\n\nThe Wembley Ware range of \"fancy ware\" was produced between 1945 and 1961 by HL Brisbane and Wunderlich Ltd/Bristile in Subiaco. The Wembley Ware range typified the spirit of post-war buoyancy in Western Australia during the 1950s, with art ceramics specifically for a local market using emblems of local Westralian identity. The majority of the works were decorative rather than functional to escape high taxes on purely decorative ceramics at this time and exploited highly coloured glazes and overtly Australian content in their designs. The majority of Wembley Ware was created with an apparent intended purpose such as vases, ashtrays or lamps, but these were usually superfluous to the designs. Some of the most sought-after and eccentric designs included the open-mouthed dhufish vase and black swan ashtray. A variety of swan-shaped ashtrays and vases were produced in a range of sizes, colours and glazes.\n\nExplorers' journals, as a literary genre, often provide descriptions of black swans. For example, in December 1836, Lieutenant Bunbury of the 21st Fusiliers was the first European to travel overland from Pinjarra to the Vasse, describing the mudflats of the Leschenault Estuary at sunset covered by \"...immense flocks of brown ducks and teal, while the water was equally covered with swans and pelicans.\"\n\nThe early colonist George Fletcher Moore included in his 1831 ballad \"So Western Australia for Me\" the lines:\n\nThe final line recalls an old English saying: \"All his swans are turned to geese\", meaning all his expectations end in nothing; all his boasting ends in smoke, like a person who fancies he sees a swan on a river but finds it to be only a goose. The phrase is sometimes reversed (as Moore has done): \"All his geese are swans\", which was commonly applied to people who think too much of the beauty and talent of their children and derived from Aesop's fable \"The Eagle and the Owl\".\n\nIn Gaito Gazdanov's short story \"Black Swans\" (1930) the protagonist commits suicide because he has no opportunity of moving to Australia, which he imagines to be an idealised paradise of graceful black swans. D. H. Lawrence wrote in the 1925 short story \"The Heritage\":\n\nMollie Skinner, Lawrence's co-author of \"The Boy in the Bush\" also wrote the novel \"Black Swans\", published in 1925 by Jonathan Cape in London. She uses Juvenal's phrase \"rara avis in terris, nigroque simillima cygno\" (\"a rare bird in the lands, and very like a black swan\") as its subtitle. It alludes to her heroine, Letty Granville.\n\nThe potency of the image of the black swan as a signifier of Westralian nationalism can be seen in this passage from Randolph Stow's \"The Merry-Go-Round in the Sea\", published in 1965:\n\nThe black swan is likely to be well represented in the toponymy of the south-west. (Toponymy is the scientific study of place names.) One example is Kurrabup (Nyungar language), or \"black swan place\", being the local Aboriginal name for the Wilson Inlet upon which the town of Denmark is situated in the South West.\n\nThe English-language place name \"Black Swan\" only occurs as a descriptive toponym once: the Black Swan Mine in the arid interior of the state near Laverton.\n\nThe more generic toponym \"Swan\", invariably referring to black swans, has at least 34 examples in Western Australia, almost entirely in the state's south-west. These range from rural locations, such as Jebarjup Swan Lake in the Great Southern region, to the iconic Swan River. The Swan River is the source of at least eight shift names, forming the largest \"swan\" place-name cluster in Australia: Upper Swan, Middle Swan, Swan Valley, Swan View, West Swan, Swan Estuary, Swan District, and the City (formerly Shire) of Swan. The Swan Land District is the major cadastral unit of the state, underlying much of the name cluster. There are at least twenty \"Swan\" street names in the Perth metropolitan area.\n\nThere are no \"White Swan\" toponyms in the state, and the toponymist Reed lists only the Swan River as a \"Swan\" toponym in the state.\n\nThe rarer form of \"Cygnet\" (\"young swan\") only occurs in three places, all along the Kimberley coast, where they commemorate the passage of William Dampier and the mutineers on the Cygnet in 1688.\n\nWith one-third of Australia's continental coastline within Western Australia, the cultural associations reflected in the scattering of shipwrecks named \"Black Swan\" is surprisingly small. A lone cutter was wrecked in May 1851 in the Peel-Harvey Estuary near Mandurah. The large estuaries of the south-west of the state are strongly associated with black swans. There are six records for the more generic shipwreck name \"Swan\" between 1869 and 1972 on the north-west and west coasts, three times more than any other state, as well as the destroyer escort HMAS \"Swan\", which was scuttled in Geographe Bay in 1997 as an artificial reef.\n\nThe coat of arms of Canberra, granted in 1928, includes swans as supporters. One swan is the black Australian kind, and the other white (similar to a European mute swan), said to be symbolising the Aboriginal and European people of Australia. A different version of this appear in the flag of the Australian Capital Territory. No other state or territory arms in eastern Australia include a black swan.\n\nSome 77 municipalities across eastern Australia have received grants of arms from the Crown since 1908, but only four include a black swan: Lake Macquarie (1970, supporter) and Queanbeyan (1980, supporter) in New South Wales, and Springvale (1976, supporter) and Sale (1985, supporters) in Victoria. These all indicate the presence of black swans in the municipal area. Campbelltown, New South Wales, has a white swan in the crest of its arms (1969), alluding to the arms of its namesake Campbell family.\n\nThere are three grants of arms to corporations that include a black swan. In 1931, the Bank of New South Wales (now Westpac) was granted arms with a black swan supporter alluding to the Bank's acquisition of the Western Australian Bank in 1927. In the same year, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons was granted arms with a black swan in the first and fourth quarters, apparently derived from the Australian Arms. In 1965, the Australian Academy of Science was granted arms with a black swan as a crest, alluding to the Academy's \"Australianness\" and its location in Canberra. The black swan has not been used in the arms of any university or residential college in eastern Australia.\n\nTwo religious authorities in eastern Victoria, the Anglican Diocese of Gippsland and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sale, have a black swan as a charge on their diocesan arms.\n\nThe transfer of postage-stamp production from the states to the Commonwealth in 1913 has resulted in four issues being produced featuring a black swan design, three commemorating a Western Australian anniversary. In 1929, a stamp designed by Perth architect George Pitt Morrison, featuring a black swan taken from one of the colonial stamp designs, marked the state's centenary. In 1954, the centenary of the first Western Australian stamp was marked by a commemorative issue in a similar style to the original one-penny Black Swan. In 1979, the state's 150th anniversary was marked with an issue featuring the anniversary logo, a stylised black swan. A 1991 series of waterbirds included a 43-cent stamp showing a pair of black swans nesting with cygnets. This is the only philatelic recognition of the black swan's cultural values in eastern Australia as an emblem of estuarine and riverine environments characteristic of south-eastern Australia.\n\nIncidental philatelic illustrations of the black swan include the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games (held in Perth) stamp issue bearing the Arms of the City of Perth with black swan supporters and charge, a 1963 commemorative of Canberra's founding featuring the city's arms, with black swan supporter, and the 1990 series of rare colonial stamps that included a reproduction of the colonial 4d Blue Inverted Swan. The black swan appears in stamp issues illustrating the Australian Arms (as one of the charges on the shield) in 1948, 1951, 1975 and 1999; and in a 1981 Queen’s Birthday commemorative illustrating Her Majesty’s personal flag (which is banner of the shield in the Australian Arms).\n\nImages of the black swan played only a minor role in the development of Australian decorative arts between the 1890s and World War One. This was a period when Australian flora and fauna decorative motifs were widely used for the first time. Images of lyrebirds, sea horses, waratahs, flannel flowers, firewheels, cockatoos and palm leaves feature prominently in the work of Lucien Henry, but the only known example of his work with a black swan is in a design for a fountain. A fountain in the central courtyard of Sydney Hospital reminiscent of Henry's design includes several black swans. Australian motifs were popular in the Queen Anne Revival or Federation architectural style of the period, but the black swan is rarely seen among the kookaburras, eucalyptus leaves and rising suns.\n\nIn 1913, the sculptor William Priestly MacIntosh carved a \"coat of arms\" for each state on the pilaster capitals of the façade of the new Commonwealth Bank headquarters on Pitt Street, Sydney. He included a black swan on a shield for Western Australia, 56 years before the state was granted a coat of arms of a similar design. The Sydney Hospital fountain and the Commonwealth Bank façade are two uncommon examples of the use of the black swan in decorative arts in eastern Australia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n\"Black Swan\" occurs rarely in literary titles. The State Library of New South Wales catalogue lists only ten fiction titles, one of which is an English-language translation of Thomas Mann's 1954 work \"The Black Swan\" (\"Die Betrogene\" in German). Humphrey McQueen’s book, \"The Black Swans of Trespass: The Emergence of Modernist Painting in Australia 1918-1944\", takes its title from the final line of the poem \"Durer: Innsbruck, 1495\": \n\nThis poem, the first by Ern Malley to be published in \"Angry Penguins\" (1943), became a celebrated literary event.\n\nThe black swan is represented in the toponymy of eastern Australia. Several anglicised versions of local Aboriginal-language place names referring to black swans are known. Examples include Dunedoo (Wiradjuri language) on the Talbragar River, Berrima (Tharawal or Gundungurra language) in the Southern Highlands, and Mulgoa (Gundungurra language) on the Nepean River, all in New South Wales; and Maroochydore on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast (Yuggera language: \"Muru-kutchi\" — meaning \"red bill\", the name of the black swan). Maroochydore is from Murukutchi-dha, the place of the black swan. This name was given by Andrew Petrie in 1842, who had two Brisbane River (Yuggera) Aboriginal men with him from whom he presumably heard the words. The local name for the swan is Kuluin. Barwon Heads, Victoria, is near Lake Connewarre, through which the Barwon River flows on its way to the sea. The name \"Connewarre\" is the local aboriginal name for the black swan, which was found in large numbers on the lake.\n\nThere are also instances of such names being newly applied today; for example, Hydro Tasmania has adopted Aboriginal names for some parts of its hydro-electric developments, such as Catagunya, meaning black swan.\n\nThe English-language place name \"Black Swan\" occurs as a descriptive toponym in four states, usually as a \"name cluster\". Queensland has a Black Swan Creek near Gladstone, together with nearby Black Swan Island and a Black Swan Rock further south near Shoalwater Bay; another Black Swan Creek near Maryborough; and a Black Swan Lagoon inland on the Darling Downs near Warwick. New South Wales has a Black Swan Anabranch adjoining a Black Swan Lagoon on the north side of the Murray River in the Corowa Shire. In South Australia's arid north, there is a Black Swan Swamp just north of Roxby Downs and a Black Swan Waterhole further north of the old Overland Telegraph line. Tasmania has a Black Swan Island near the wild South West Cape. Given the broad sweep of the black swan's natural habitat, the presence of only nine distinctive place names or name clusters within that range indicates the rarity of \"Black Swan\" as a toponym. New Zealand also has a Black Swan Stream in the South Auckland district.\n\nThe more generic toponym \"Swan\" invariably refers to black swans. The \"Gazetteer of Australia\" lists 57 examples in New South Wales, 32 in Tasmania, 20 in Queensland, 19 in Victoria, 10 in South Australia, 5 in the Northern Territory, and none in the other territories. Some idiosyncratic examples are Swan Hole (NSW), Swan Spit (Vic) and Swan Nook (Tas). The Gazetter also lists two \"White Swan\" toponyms: a mine and reservoir near St Arnaud, on the Victorian goldfields. A clear concentration is evident in New South Wales and Tasmania. By contrast, the toponymist Reed lists only three examples: Swan Hill and Swan Pond in Victoria, and Swan Point in Tasmania (all named by explorers after sighting black swans in large numbers).\n\nIn Sydney, there are thirteen \"Swan\" street names and one \"Black Swan\" street name, in contrast to a lone \"Swan\" street name in Darwin.\n\nThe rarer form of \"Cygnet\" (\"young swan\") occasionally occurs. The \"Gazetteer of Australia\" records eleven in Tasmania (the densest concentration), five in South Australia and one in Victoria, but Reed's only example is Cygnet, Tasmania, anglicised from Port des Cygnes, so-named by the French explorer Bruni d'Entrecasteaux in 1793 because of the large number of swans he observed there.\n\nAnother cultural association is reflected in the scattering of shipwrecks named \"Black Swan\". Tasmania has a wrecked schooner (1830) off Prime Seal Island in the Bass Strait and a wrecked fishing boat (1950) off Swansea on the east coast. New South Wales has two wrecks off its northern coast: a cutter near Newcastle (1852) and a paddle steamer (1868) near the Manning River. The name \"Black Swan\" probably refers to the aquatic characteristics of black swans such as buoyancy and a graceful style, even though the shipwreck record suggests the hope in the name association was not always well founded. There are five records for the more generic \"Swan\" between 1836 and 1934: one in Tasmania, and two each in Victoria and New South Wales, including torpedo-boat destroyer HMAS \"Swan\", scuttled in 1934.\n\nIn Australian rules football, the symbol of the black swan has been used prominently by the West Australian interstate teams since the state debuted in 1904. The black swan symbol has featured in the State of Origin series between 1977-1998 on the various guernsey designs (with some variations contrasting the swan depicted in the colours of the state emblem in reverse – as yellow on a black background and others with a yellow outline). The 1978 variation of the WA jumper was used one-off by the West Coast Eagles in the Australian Football League Heritage Round in July 2007.\n\nThe names of two Australian rules football clubs illustrate a contemporary variation of the ways in which cultural references to the black swan have changed and been transformed over time.\n\nThe Swan Districts Football Club was established in 1932 at Bassendean, near the industrial and railway hub of the Swan District and a large community of expatriate Victorians. The name associated the club with the place, as did its emblem of a black swan. The club has since played in the West Australian Football League.\n\nThe South Melbourne Football Club was established in 1874 and was one of the founding clubs in the VFL/AFL. During the 1920s and 1930s, an influx of players from Western Australia led to the team becoming known as the \"swans\" within the VFL. In 1982, South Melbourne transferred to Sydney, dropping its old place name but retaining its nickname as the Sydney Swans. The swan, however, is no longer a black swan but a white swan, derived from existing red and white colours of South Melbourne and the lake-bound white swans of Albert Park near its original home ground. The white swan is often combined with, or replaced by, a white Sydney Opera House-style logo.\n\nThis is an apparently rare example of Western Australian swan symbolism being transferred eastward, then transformed to symbolise something else, retaining only an echo of its formerly symbolic values. None of the current AFL teams have taken a black swan emblem in allusion to any natural qualities of the bird, and its sole representation in the symbology of the league refers to the largely unresearched phenomenon of late 19th-mid 20th century migration between Western Australia and Victoria - now borne by a club that has emigrated to New South Wales. It is an ironic transformation in the symbolism of a bird that that was for so long thought to be non-migratory.\n\nThe tender to \"Australia II\", the yacht that won the 1983 America's Cup at Newport, Rhode Island, was called \"Black Swan\".\n\nGian Carlo Menotti, in his opera \"The Medium\", named one of his most famous arias \"The Black Swan\", which is a \"dark lullaby\" sung by the character Monica.\n\nPerth rock group The Triffids released an album called \"The Black Swan\" in 1989.\n\nThe American thrash metal band Megadeth released a song entitled \"Black Swan\" as a bonus track on their 2007 album \"United Abominations\". This song was later re-recorded and re-released on their 2011 album \"Thirteen\".\n\nSinger/songwriter Tori Amos released a song entitled \"Black Swan\" as a bonus track on her 1994 UK CD single \"Pretty Good Year\".\n\nSinger Thom Yorke of the band Radiohead released a song entitled \"Black Swan\" on the soundtrack of the 2006 film \"A Scanner Darkly\" and, three days later, on his debut solo album, \"The Eraser\".\n\nThe American alternative-rock band Chiodos released a song entitled \"Lexington\", which references black swans in the lyric, \"All the water in the ocean couldn't turn this swan's legs from black to white.\"\n\nThe American avant-garde band The Blood Brothers released a song entitled \"Giant Swan\", in which a giant swan is used as a metaphor for society and war, until it is renamed in the lyric, \"It's gonna sting like a raw sunrise when the Black Swan's gone.\"\n\nFinnish power metal band Sonata Arctica included a song entitled \"Fly With the Black Swan\" on their 2007 album \"Unia\".\n\nAmerican band Story of the Year released an album entitled \"The Black Swan\" in 2008.\n\nThe American ambient band Amber Asylum released a song entitled \"Black Swan\" on their 2000 album \"The Supernatural Parlour Collection\".\n\nThe German death metal/gothic rock band Lacrimas Profundere released a song entitled \"Black Swans\" on their 1999 album \"Memorandum\".\n\nThe Japanese noise artist Merzbow titled the eighth volume of his 2009-2010 box set \"13 Japanese Birds\" \"Black Swan\".\n\nJohn Stuart Mill in the chapter \"Of The Ground Of Induction\" in his A System of Logic (1843) cited the example of \"all swans are white\" as a case of incorrect induction based on genuine experiences with erroneous conclusions. \"As there were black swans, though civilized people had existed for three thousand years on the earth without meeting with them...The uniform experience, therefore, of the inhabitants of the known world, agreeing in a common result, without one known instance of deviation from that result, is not always sufficient to establish a general conclusion.\"\n\nBertrand Russell cited the case of the 'black swan' in his chapter \"On Induction\" in his 1912 publication The Problems of Philosophy. \nKarl Popper used the black swan example in his argument on falsifiability in \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\" invoking David Hume.\n\n\"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable\" is the title of an influential 2007 book by Lebanese thinker Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The book expounds Taleb's theory that rare, unexpected, highly anomalous events are both more common and more momentous than previously imagined. This theory has since become known as the black swan theory.\n"}

{"id": "43609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43609", "title": "Jumping", "text": "Jumping\n\nJumping or leaping is a form of locomotion or movement in which an organism or non-living (e.g., robotic) mechanical system propels itself through the air along a ballistic trajectory. Jumping can be distinguished from running, galloping and other gaits where the entire body is temporarily airborne, by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and high angle of initial launch.\n\nSome animals, such as the kangaroo, employ jumping (commonly called \"hopping\" in this instance) as their primary form of locomotion, while others, such as frogs, use it only as a means to escape predators. Jumping is also a key feature of various activities and sports, including the long jump, high jump and show jumping.\n\nAll jumping involves the application of force against a substrate, which in turn generates a reactive force that propels the jumper away from the substrate. Any solid or liquid capable of producing an opposing force can serve as a substrate, including ground or water. Examples of the latter include dolphins performing traveling jumps, and Indian skitter frogs executing standing jumps from water.\n\nJumping organisms are rarely subject to significant aerodynamic forces and, as a result, their jumps are governed by the basic physical laws of ballistic trajectories. Consequently, while a bird may jump into the air to initiate flight, no movement it performs once airborne is considered jumping, as the initial jump conditions no longer dictate its flight path. \n\nFollowing the moment of launch (i.e., initial loss of contact with the substrate), a jumper will traverse a parabolic path. The launch angle and initial launch velocity determine the travel distance, duration, and height of the jump. The maximum possible horizontal travel distance occurs at a launch angle of 45 degrees, but any launch angle between 35 and 55 degrees will result in ninety percent of the maximum possible distance.\n\nMuscles (or other actuators in non-living systems) do physical work, adding kinetic energy to the jumper's body over the course of a jump's propulsive phase. This results in a kinetic energy at launch that is proportional to the square of the jumper's speed. The more work the muscles do, the greater the launch velocity and thus the greater the acceleration and the shorter the time interval of the jump's propulsive phase.\n\nMechanical power (work per unit time) and the distance over which that power is applied (e.g., leg length) are the key determinants of jump distance and height. As a result, many jumping animals have long legs and muscles that are optimized for maximal power according to the force-velocity relationship of muscles. The maximum power output of muscles is limited, however. To circumvent this limitation, many jumping species slowly pre-stretch elastic elements, such as tendons or apodemes, to store work as strain energy. Such elastic elements can release energy at a much higher rate (higher power) than equivalent muscle mass, thus increasing launch energy to levels beyond what muscle alone is capable of.\n\nA jumper may be either stationary or moving when initiating a jump. In a jump from stationary (i.e., a \"standing jump\"), all of the work required to accelerate the body through launch is done in a single movement. In a \"moving jump\" or \"running jump\", the jumper introduces additional vertical velocity at launch while conserving as much horizontal momentum as possible. Unlike stationary jumps, in which the jumper's kinetic energy at launch is solely due to the jump movement, moving jumps have a higher energy that results from the inclusion of the horizontal velocity preceding the jump. Consequently, jumpers are able to jump greater distances when starting from a run.\n\nAnimals use a wide variety of anatomical adaptations for jumping. These adaptations are exclusively concerned with the launch, as any post-launch method of extending range or controlling the jump must use aerodynamic forces, and thus is considered gliding or parachuting.\n\nAquatic species rarely display any particular specializations for jumping. Those that are good jumpers usually are primarily adapted for speed, and execute moving jumps by simply swimming to the surface at a high velocity. A few primarily aquatic species that can jump while on land, such as mud skippers, do so via a flick of the tail.\n\nIn terrestrial animals, the primary propulsive structure is the legs, though a few species use their tails. Typical characteristics of jumping species include long legs, large leg muscles, and additional limb elements.\n\nLong legs increase the time and distance over which a jumping animal can push against the substrate, thus allowing more power and faster, farther jumps. Large leg muscles can generate greater force, resulting in improved jumping performance. In addition to elongated leg elements, many jumping animals have modified foot and ankle bones that are elongated and possess additional joints, effectively adding more segments to the limb and even more length.\n\nFrogs are an excellent example of all three trends: frog legs can be nearly twice the body length, leg muscles may account for up to twenty percent of body weight, and they have not only lengthened the foot, shin and thigh, but extended the ankle bones into another limb joint and similarly extended the hip bones and gained mobility at the sacrum for a second 'extra joint'. As a result, frogs are the undisputed champion jumpers of vertebrates, leaping over fifty body lengths, a distance of more than eight feet.\n\nGrasshoppers use elastic energy storage to increase jumping distance. Although power output is a principal determinant of jump distance (as noted above), physiological constraints limit muscle power to approximately 375 Watts per kilogram of muscle. To overcome this limitation, grasshoppers anchor their legs via an internal \"catch mechanism\" while their muscles stretch an elastic apodeme (similar to a vertebrate tendon). When the catch is released, the apodeme rapidly releases its energy. Because the apodeme releases energy more quickly than muscle, its power output exceeds that of the muscle that produced the energy.\n\nThis is analogous to a human throwing an arrow by hand versus using a bow; the use of elastic storage (the bow) allows the muscles to operate closer to isometric on the force-velocity curve. This enables the muscles to do work over a longer time and thus produce more energy than they otherwise could, while the elastic element releases that work faster than the muscles can. The use of elastic energy storage has been found in jumping mammals as well as in frogs, with commensurate increases in power ranging from two to seven times that of equivalent muscle mass.\n\nOne way to classify jumping is by the manner of foot transfer. In this classification system, five basic jump forms are distinguished:\n\nLeaping gaits, which are distinct from running gaits (see Locomotion), include cantering, galloping, and pronging.\n\nThe height of a jump may be increased by using a trampoline or by converting horizontal velocity into vertical velocity with the aid of a device such as a half pipe.\n\nVarious exercises can be used to increase an athlete's vertical jumping height. One category of such exercises—plyometrics—employs repetition of discrete jumping-related movements to increase speed, agility, and power.\n\nIt has been shown in research that children who are more physically active display more proficient jumping (along with other basic motor skill) patterns. \n\nIt is also noted that jumping development in children has a direct relationship with age. As children grow older, it is seen that their jumping abilities in all forms also increase. Jumping development is more easily identifiable in children rather than adults due to the fact that there are less physical differences at a younger age. Adults of the same age may be vastly different in terms of physicality and athleticism making it difficult to see how age affects jumping ability. \n\n"}

The screenplay by Jeremy Leven is based on the 1995 book \"The Legend of Bagger Vance: A Novel of Golf and the Game of Life\" by Steven Pressfield. It takes place in the U.S. state of Georgia in 1931. The film served as the final roles of Jack Lemmon before his death the following year and Lane Smith before his death five years later.\n\nOn release, the film was a box office bomb, grossing almost $40 million worldwide, and received mixed to negative reviews; criticism was targeted by several African American commentators and reviewers for employing the \"magical negro\" stereotype.\n\nAs an old man having his sixth heart attack while playing golf, Hardy Greaves (Jack Lemmon) contemplates how his wife used to ask him (before her passing) why he insisted on playing \"a game that seems destined to kill\" him. Explaining his love for the game, he begins the story of his childhood idol: Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon).\n\nJunuh is the favorite son of Savannah, Georgia: a noteworthy golfer from a wealthy family, he and his beautiful girlfriend named Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) seem to have it all. While serving as a captain in the US Army during World War I, Junuh is traumatized when his entire company is wiped out in battle. Though he earns the Medal of Honor, he disappears after the war, returning to Georgia years later as a broken-down alcoholic.\n\nAt the start of the Great Depression (circa 1930), Adele is trying to recover her family's lost fortune by holding a four-round, two-day exhibition match between Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill), the best golfers of the era, with a grand prize of $10,000, at a golf resort her father opened as the Depression struck. However, she needs a local participant to generate local interest. The young Greaves () speaks up for his hero, Junuh, prompting Adele to ask her estranged lover to play.\n\nJunuh is approached by a mysterious traveler carrying a suitcase, who appears while Junuh is trying to hit golf balls into the dark void of night. The man identifies himself as Bagger Vance (Will Smith) and says he will be Junuh's caddie. With Greaves as assistant caddie, Bagger helps Junuh come to grips with his personal demons and play golf again.\n\nWhen the match starts, Jones and Hagen each play well in their distinctive ways, but the disengaged Junuh plays poorly and is far behind after the first round. With Bagger caddying for him and giving advice, Junuh rediscovers his \"authentic swing\" in the second round and makes up some ground. In the third round, he closes the gap even more, hitting a hole in one in the process. Meanwhile, Junuh and Adele rekindle their romance.\n\nLate in the final round, Junuh disregards Bagger's advice at a crucial point and after that plays poorly. He hits a ball into a forest, where he has a traumatic World War I flashback, but Bagger's words help him to focus on the game. Junuh pulls back to a tie with Jones and Hagen, then has a chance to win on the final hole, but has the integrity to call a penalty on himself when his ball moves after he tries to remove a loose impediment.\n\nSeeing Junuh has grown and matured, Bagger decides his golfer doesn't need him any more. With the 18th hole left unfinished, Bagger gives the position of caddie to Greaves, and leaves Junuh as mysteriously as he came.\n\nThough losing a chance to win because of the penalty, Junuh sinks an improbable putt and the match ends in a gentlemanly three-way tie. The three golfers shake hands with all of Savannah cheering. Junuh and Adele get back together.\n\nThe old Greaves wakes up and sees an unaged Bagger Vance beckoning him from a distance. Hardy follows, presumably to the afterlife.\n\n\nThe plot is loosely based on the Hindu sacred text the Bhagavad Gita, where the Warrior/Hero Arjuna (R. Junuh) refuses to fight. The god Krishna appears as Bhagavan (Bagger Vance) to help him to follow his path as the warrior and hero that he was meant to be. This relationship was fully explained by Steven J. Rosen in his book \"Gita on the Green\", for which Steven Pressfield wrote the foreword.\n\nPortions of the exhibition match were set at the Kiawah Island Golf Resort in South Carolina, United States, considered one of the toughest in the country. The scene in which Greaves has a heart attack was shot on No. 11 of the resort's Cougar Point golf course. The final hole in the film was temporary, so the filming did not interfere with the club activities, and cost US $200,000 to build. However, most of the golf scenes were filmed at Colleton River Plantation, just off Hilton Head Island. Certain segments of this film were also filmed in Savannah and Jekyll Island, Georgia.\n\nReaction from the movie critics was mixed. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 43% based on 129 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Despite the talent involved in \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\", performances are hindered by an inadequate screenplay full of flat characters and bad dialogue. Also, not much happens, and some critics are offended by how the film glosses over issues of racism.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert, who gave it 3½ stars, said, \"It handles a sports movie the way Billie Holiday handled a trashy song, by finding the love and pain beneath the story. Redford and his writer, Jeremy Leven, starting from a novel by Steven Pressfield, are very clear in their minds about what they want to do. They want to explain why it is possible to devote your life to the love of golf, and they want to hint that golf and life may have a lot in common\". The BBC's George Perry called it a \"sumptuously photographed film\" but added that \"in spite of being lovely to look at, it is pretentious piffle, although Will Smith shows skill and subtlety in his ludicrous role\".\n\n\"Time\" called it one of the most \"embarrassing\" films of recent years for its treatment of African Americans and the use of a \"Magical African-American Friend\".\n\n\"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" opened at #3 at the U.S. box office, grossing $11,516,712 from 2,061 theaters. According to the Internet Movie Database, the film's total gross came to $30,695,227, far short of its estimated $80 million budget.<ref name=\"IMDB Box Office/Business\"> </ref>\n\nThe now out-of-print soundtrack to \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" was released on November 7, 2000.

The title of World Chess Champion had been split for 13 years. This match, played between September 23 and October 13, 2006, in Elista, Kalmykia, Russia, was to reunite the two World Chess Champion titles and produce an undisputed World Champion.\n\nKramnik won the first two games, establishing a commanding lead. However, after Topalov's camp alleged that Kramnik was using computer assistance, Kramnik forfeited Game 5. He eventually agreed to play again under protest. Topalov won games 8 and 9, taking the lead for the first time, but Kramnik struck back with a win in game 10. The remaining games were drawn, sending the match to a tiebreak. After a draw in the first game and a win apiece in the second and third games, Kramnik won the fourth game after Topalov blundered, to win the tiebreak and the match, becoming the 14th undisputed World Chess Champion.\n\nAfter Garry Kasparov split from FIDE in 1993, there were two world chess champions. There was the 'Classical' world champion, the title that only passes on to a player when he defeats the previous world champion. This was held by Kasparov, until he was defeated by Kramnik in the Classical World Chess Championship 2000. There was also the 'Official' FIDE world champion, determined by various tournament formats, held since the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005 by Topalov.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2006, no match was ever held between the various classical and official champions. This match brought the two titleholders together to unify the World Chess Championship for the first time since the 1993 split.\n\nKramnik was invited to the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005 in San Luis, Argentina. As \"Classical\" World Champion, he refused to play, but indicated his willingness to play the winner in a match to unify the title. Negotiations for a match began soon after Topalov won in San Luis, but broke down after the two camps were unable to overcome substantial differences of opinion.\n\nHowever, in April 2006, FIDE announced that Kramnik would play current FIDE Champion Veselin Topalov in a world championship match to unify the \"Classical\" champion line with the FIDE championship. The prize fund of $1 million would be evenly divided between the players – regardless of the outcome of the match.\n\nIn past encounters, Kramnik had defeated Topalov 10 times, lost 5 games, with 24 draws. (This becomes +19 −9 =34 if rapid and blindfold games are included.) In classical time control games since the beginning of 2004, the score was 2 wins each, with 3 draws.\n\nThe match was a best of 12 games. Players scored 1 point for a win and half a point for a draw. If, after 12 games, the score was tied at 6 points each, then a tie-break would be held. As it turned out, the first round of tie-breaks (rapid games) was indeed required, and was held on October 13, 2006.\n\nFrom the match conditions:\n\nThe primary time control for each game shall be: 40 moves in the first 120 minutes, and if that is met, then a secondary time control of 20 moves in 60 minutes, and if that is also met, then the rest of the game shall be played out in 15 minutes, with an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 61.\n\nColors were determined for the regular games by the drawing of lots at the opening ceremony on 21 September 2006. The colors reversed between games 6 and 7. The colors for the first tie-break game were decided by drawing lots again. All regular games, and the first tie-break game, began at 3:00 p.m. local time, which corresponds to 1100 UTC.\n\nThis is the only world chess championship match where the same opening move (1.d4) was played in every game. Only two openings, the Slav Defense and the Catalan, were played.\n\nKramnik won the first round of this match in a 75-move game that lasted six and a half hours. Topalov, whose style is more tactical than positional, blundered when he played a risky move late in the game. Topalov had a drawn position throughout most of the game and made a fatal miscalculation.\n\nKramnik won the second game of the match after 63 moves, taking a 2–0 lead. Topalov missed winning continuations at move 32 and 36. Some inaccuracies later in the game cost him the draw.\n\nThe third game ended in a draw after 38 moves keeping Kramnik in a 2½–½ lead. Kramnik (white) had the advantage for much of the game. According to commentators he at least twice avoided moves with more winning chances but which also carried more risk: 17. Ne4 and 32. exd5.\n\nThe fourth game ended in a draw after White's 54th move, leaving Kramnik with a 3–1 lead. Topalov pressed hard, sacrificing a pawn. He achieved an advantageous endgame but despite five hours of play he failed to convert it (48.Qxc4! gave good chances, according to Sergei Shipov on chesspro.ru).\n\nKramnik was due to play the white pieces. The game ended with Topalov winning by forfeit, after Kramnik refused to play and his clock had been allowed to run for one hour. Kramnik's lead was reduced to 3–2. This is the first world chess championship match since Spassky–Fischer 1972 in which a game was forfeited.\n\nGame 6 was due to be played on September 30, but was postponed until October 2 by the decision of the FIDE president. On September 30 and October 1 negotiations over match continuation between players, their teams, and FIDE took place instead. Kramnik agreed to play Game 6 under protest, with the status of Game 5 to be resolved later. The game was uneventful, ending in a draw after 31 moves. Kramnik played a rare sideline and gradually equalized. Kramnik now led 3½–2½.\n\nThe 5-hour game, a Semi-Slav Defence, was characterized as \"a hard-fought 60-move draw\". Topalov successfully defended a RBvRN ending a pawn down. Kramnik now led 4–3.\n\nGame 8 lasted 4½ hours, and resulted in Topalov's first win over the board in the match, tying the score at 4–4. It featured the strategically unbalanced Meran Variation Semi-Slav Defense. Topalov's 15...Qa5 was a theoretical novelty. After 21 moves, the players reached a sharp, complicated, queenless middlegame with Topalov having two knights for Kramnik's rook and pawn. Topalov spun a mating web with his knights and rook, aided by Kramnik's mistakes on moves 32 and 41.\n\nGame 9 was a 3-hour tussle featuring a Slav Defense. Topalov's 6.Nh4 and 7.Nxg6 is a standard idea gaining White the advantage of the bishop pair. Topalov followed up in unusual fashion, however, with a3, g3, and f4 on the next three moves, leading Susan Polgar to observe that, \"Topalov made way too many Pawn moves in the opening.\" However, Kramnik was unable to find an effective response and eventually ended up in a middlegame position where his two knights were outmatched by Topalov's powerful bishops. Topalov steadily improved his position, seizing space and launching an attack on the king-side. A strong tactical blow by Topalov on move 38 won the game for him. Kramnik, who had struggled with a steadily deteriorating position in time trouble, resigned following Topalov's 39th move. Topalov took the lead for the first time in the match, with the score now 5–4.\n\nKramnik played the solid Catalan System. At move 17, Topalov, playing Black, offered Kramnik the opportunity to win a pawn if he was willing to give up his fianchettoed king's bishop for a knight (and thus weaken his king position). Kramnik accepted the offer. Susan Polgar wrote that Topalov's \"compensation is his Bishop pair, good Knight on e4 and the White Knight is pinned on b5.\"\n\nHowever, Topalov blundered on move 24, allowing Kramnik to win a second pawn. Topalov then gave up his rook for a knight and two pawns. That left Kramnik ahead a rook for a knight and, after forcing the trade of queens, he won the endgame easily. The match was now level 5–5.\n\nThe eleventh game ended in a draw after 66 moves, leaving the match level at 5½–5½. Towards the end, Kramnik was pressing hard for the full point, a pawn ahead in a rook and bishop endgame, but was unable to convert his advantage.\n\nThis game featured the same variation of the Slav Defense (6.Nh4 Bg6 7.Nxg6 hxg6) as in games 9 (a Topalov win) and 11 (a draw), but for the first time Kramnik played the White side of this line. In a queen and rook endgame, with both kings open, Topalov forced a draw by perpetual check. This left the score tied 6–6 at the end of regular time-control play (Kramnik 6 – Topalov 5 in played games, plus the game 5 forfeit in favor of Topalov). Tie-breaker games were now played to determine the outcome of the match.\n\nIn the middlegame of this first game in the rapid tie-break Topalov made a pawn offer, which Kramnik accepted. Kramnik then exploited some tactics to return the pawn and trade into a level endgame.\n\nWhite obtained a minimal advantage from the opening, which he maintained until queens were exchanged. Kramnik won in the endgame, to go up 1½–½.\n\nTopalov equalized the tiebreak match with the sort of kingside attack he has become famous for.\n\nJust like in the second tiebreak game, Kramnik displayed his skill in positions where the queens have been exchanged. Topalov's small inaccuracy on move 20 was punished by a precise sequence of moves from Kramnik, which eventually won him a pawn. In an extremely difficult position, Topalov made one final blunder, and the match was over.\n\nTopalov's 44. ... Rxc5?? cost him the game and the title. However, in a post-match interview, Kramnik claimed that he had a decisive advantage even before Topalov's blunder. According to Australian GM Ian Rogers in \"Chess Life Online\", White should still win against the superior defense 44...e5 with 45.Rab5.\n\nforfeit *\n\nOn September 28, 2006, the rest day between games 4 and 5, Topalov's manager Silvio Danailov complained to the match organizers and the press about Kramnik's repeated visits to the bathroom. He noted that the bathrooms are the only place not under audio or video surveillance, and called the frequency of the breaks \"strange, if not suspicious\". Danailov suggested that Topalov would abandon the match if the concerns were not addressed.\n\nOn September 29, 2006, the Appeals Committee, which consisted of Georgios Makropoulos, Jorge Vega, and Zurab Azmaiparashvili, determined that, although the frequency of Kramnik's visits to the toilet had been exaggerated, the private bathrooms would be closed and a common toilet opened for both players.\n\nIn response, Kramnik's manager Carsten Hensel issued a public statement insisting that the original match conditions be adhered to – defending Kramnik's actions by saying, \"The restroom is small and Mr Kramnik likes to walk and therefore uses the space of the bathroom as well...It should also be mentioned that Mr Kramnik has to drink a lot of water during the games.\" Otherwise, \"Mr Kramnik will stop playing this match as long as FIDE is not ready to respect Mr Kramnik's rights, in this case to use the toilet of his own restroom whenever he wishes to do so.\" Hensel also declared his lack of confidence in the Appeals Committee and demanded that its members be changed.\n\nAwaiting a reversal of the Appeal Committee's decision, Kramnik refused to play Game 5. At 5:00 p.m. local time, the Chief Arbiter declared that Kramnik had forfeited.\n\nFIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov told Kramnik \"...I hereby inform you of my full trust in the members of the Match Appeals Committee and their latest decision taken in respect of the appeal of Topalov's team dated 28 September 2006. I am also asking you in good faith to continue your participation in this match...\"\n\nLater, it emerged that Kramnik's team made a procedural blunder by not filing their protest before he defaulted the fifth game.\n\nThe players were invited for a meeting by Ilyumzhinov \"to discuss the actual situation of the match and to solve the problems\". Ilyumzhinov stated that cancelling the forfeit was possible, but that if no compromise was reached by noon on 1 October, the match would not continue.\n\nOn October 1, 2006, FIDE announced that agreement had been reached that the original bathroom arrangements would be reinstated and that the Appeals Committee had resigned and would be replaced.\n\nLater that day, FIDE announced that Game 6 would be played on October 2, with the forfeit standing and the score Kramnik 3 – Topalov 2. Kramnik replied that he was \"ready to proceed playing the match by reserving all my rights. My further participation will be subject to the condition to clarify my rights regarding game five at later stage.\"\n\nOn October 3, 2006, the new Appeals Committee responded to Kramnik's appeal against the Game 5 forfeit saying that they had no powers to vary the decisions of the original Appeals Committee. Earlier, Kramnik had said that if his appeal fails, \"the only thing I know for sure is that in this case I will sue FIDE.\"\n\nKramnik's manager expressed concern that a member of Topalov's team might attempt to plant an electronic device in Kramnik's bathroom to foster suspicion that Kramnik is cheating. He suggested several measures relating to the inspection of the bathroom and Kramnik's person meant to forestall this possibility.\n\nOn October 2, 2006, more than 30 GMs, WGMs, and IMs expressed open support for Kramnik's position – including former World Champions Anatoly Karpov and Boris Spassky, and multiple-time challenger Viktor Korchnoi. Spassky and Korchnoi had been involved in controversial World Chess Championship matches (World Chess Championship 1972 and World Chess Championship 1978 respectively). Spassky felt that Fischer had only disputed against the organizers, not his opponent's conduct. Korchnoi, in an interview, stated that he would simply have walked out of the match.\n\nOn October 10, 2006, in a press release Team Kramnik said: \"Should the decision of FIDE regarding the fifth game have any influence on the awarding of the World Championship title, with Mr. Topalov receiving the title after being granted a free point for the unplayed game, Mr Kramnik declares unequivocally: \"I will not recognize Mr Topalov as World Champion under these conditions, and I will take legal action against FIDE at the end of the World Championship.\"\n\nSince Kramnik won the match, this situation did not eventuate.\n\nOn October 4, Topalov's manager, Silvio Danailov, issued a press release that identified what it labeled \"coincidence statistics\" showing the percentage of times that Kramnik played a move that would be recommended by Chessbase's Fritz 9 chessplaying software in that position (about 78% on average).\n\nGM Susan Polgar – who did not believe Kramnik was using computer assistance – characterized this as \"another black eye for Danailov and chess. Even if he believes that it is true, he should complain to the committee and not through a press release. This is unprofessional and unacceptable.\"\n\nAt the press conference following Game 7, Kramnik commented on the second game where the Fritz analysis had shown a match with 87% of Kramnik's moves. Kramnik said, \"A proper analysis must take into consideration that in the second game we both blundered a mate in three! First of all, this 87% is total nonsense – everything depends on the time allotted to the engine for analyzing a given position. Secondly, Topalov's percentages in San Luis, for example, were even higher.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Spanish daily \"ABC\" published on 14 December 2006, Topalov alleged that Kramnik had cheated with computer help during the match, that network cables had been found in the bathroom ceiling, that threats were issued, and that he felt physically unsafe during the match.\n\nKramnik, as the winner of the match, earned the FIDE World Champion slot in the World Chess Championship 2007, an eight-player, double round-robin tournament. The loser of the match, Topalov, was eliminated from the 2007 World Championship cycle. Despite this, Topalov's manager was quoted after the match as saying \"FIDE regulations allow every world champion that has lost the title to challenge the title holder. The total prize fund is 1.5 million dollars. We will find this money and will request the game to take place in Sofia. We will offer an exact date, 3rd of March 2007.\" When FIDE announced plans for the 2007–2009 World Championship cycle, it was confirmed that Topalov was excluded from the 2007 tournament, but he (along with Kramnik) was given special privileges for the 2008 and 2009 cycle.\n\nThe allegations of cheating seriously damaged relations between Kramnik and Topalov. Nine years after the match, in 2015, Kramnik stated in an interview that he does not respect Topalov as a person and will not shake hands with him. As of 2017, Kramnik and Topalov still refuse to shake hands in their encounters. Their rival scores after 2006 was tied in classical chess (+3, -3, =3 as of April 2017), and despite their rivalry, their games are still in very high quality. Notable games include Topalov's brilliant sacrifice 12. Nxf7 in Corus 2008 .\n\n"}
{"id": "83251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83251", "title": "Yacht racing", "text": "Yacht racing\n\nYacht racing is a form of sport involving sailing yachts and larger sailboats, as distinguished from dinghy racing. It is composed of multiple yachts, in direct competition, racing around a course marked by buoys or other fixed navigational devices or racing longer distances across open water from point-to-point. It can involve a series of races when buoy racing or multiple legs when point-to-point racing.\n\nYachting, that is, recreational boating, is very old, as exemplified in the ancient poem Catullus 4:\n\n<poem>\nThe yacht you see there, friends, \nsays that she's been\nThe fastest piece of timber ever seen;\nShe swears that once she could have overhauled\nAll rival boats, whether the challenge called\nFor racing under canvas or with oars.\n</poem>\n\n\"Yacht\" is referred to as deriving from either Norwegian (\"jagt\"), Middle Low German (\"jaght\") or from the Dutch word jacht, which means \"a swift light vessel of war, commerce or pleasure. The sporting element in the word lies in the derivation of jaght from the root jaghen, which means to hunt, chase or pursue….\"\n\nThe formal racing of boats is believed to have started with sailboats in the Netherlands some time in the 17th century. Soon, in England, custom-built racing \"yachts\" began to emerge and the Royal Yacht Squadron was established in 1815. In 1661 John Evelyn recorded a competition between \"Katherine\" and \"Anne\", two large royal sailing vessels both of English design, \"…the wager 100-1; the race from Greenwich to Gravesend and back.\" One of the vessels was owned, and sometimes steered, by Charles II, the King of England. The king lost.\n\nIn 1782 the Cumberland Fleet, a class of sailing vessel known for its ability to sail close to the wind, were painted racing up the Thames River with spectators viewing from a bridge. Much like today, this obsession with sailing close to the wind with speed and efficiency fueled the racing community.\n\nIn the nineteenth century most yacht races were started by allotting starting positions to the competitors. Buoys were laid in a straight line, to which the competitors attached their yachts by means of spring ropes. The yachts were required to keep all the sails forward of the main mast on deck until the starting signal was given. \nThe Yacht Racing Association was founded in 1875 by Prince Batthyany-Strattman, Captain J. W. Hughes, and Mr. Dixon Kemp. The Y.R.A. wrote standardised yacht racing rules which included the 'Flying Start' used today.\n\nBringing yacht racing to the forefront of public life, the America's Cup was first raced in 1851 between the New York Yacht Club and the Royal Yacht Squadron. Not ruled or regulated by measurement criteria as today, it is the second-place finisher was Aurora, \"and but for the fact that time allowance had been waived for the race she would have been the winner by a handsome margin.\" Subsequently, the Cup races were conducted, usually every 3–4 years, based on a challenge issued by one club to the current Cup holder, which till 1983 was the NYYC.\n\nAs at 2017, the La Ciotat Based Yacht Partridge 1885 is documented as being the world's oldest, still fully operational classic racing yacht. \n\nAs yacht racing became more prevalent, and yacht design more diverse, it was necessary to establish systems of measurements and time allowances due to the differences in boat design. Longer yachts are inherently faster than shorter ones; therefore, in the interests of fairness, in the 1820s a “primitive system of time allowance was introduced on the Solent.” Larger yachts were handicapped; but owners with the biggest vessels had a problem with the allowance system, for they preferred that crossing the finish line first, much as in foot and horse races, should suffice to win the contest. As a result, both ratings and “one-design” competition were developed.\n\nRatings systems rely upon some formulaic analysis of usually very specific yacht-design parameters such as length, sail area, displacement, and hull shape. During the 1920s and through the 1970s the Cruising Club of America established a formula by which most racing/cruising boats were designed during that period. After its descendant, the mathematically complex International Offshore Rule (IOR) of the 1970s, contributed to much decreased seaworthiness (and even speed), the simpler Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) system was adopted. The PHRF uses only proven performance characteristics, especially theoretical sailing speed, as a means to allow dissimilar yachts—typically crewed by friends and families at clubs rather than by professional crews—to race together. Most popular family-oriented cruising sailboats will have a rating filed with a local chapter of the PHRF.\n\nThe most prevalent handicap rating systems today are the ORC, ORR, IRC, and the PHRF.\nMany countries organise their own handicap systems which do not take into account the size, weight, or sail area of the yacht, but performance is measured on the basis of previous race results. The Irish E.C.H.O. system is such a handicap system.\n\nOne-design racing was invented by Thomas (Ben) Middleton in 1886 in Killiney Bay close to Dublin City, Republic of Ireland. Middleton was concerned that winning a yacht race was more reliant on having an expensive new yacht, than it was on the skill of the yachtsman. One design yacht racing is conducted with classes of similar boats, all built—often via mass-production—to the same design, with the same sail area and rig, and the same number of crew, so that crew ability and tactical expertise are more likely to decide a race than boat type, or age, or even weather. Popular racing boats such as The Water Wag, Laser, the J/22 and J/24, the Etchells, and the Star and New York 30 of Nathanael Herreshoff are examples of one-design boats.\n\nIn general, modern yacht-racing contests are conducted according to the Racing Rules of Sailing, first established in 1928. Though complex, the RRS are intended primarily simply ensure fairness and safety. The Rules are revised and updated every four years by the body now known as World Sailing.\n\nThe major races of today can be classified as offshore, ocean, around the world, and inshore racing all adhering to one set of rule, but diverse handicapping standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It opened in 1938 and hosted the University of New Mexico Lobos football team until they moved to University Stadium in 1960. The stadium continued in use for intramural sports until 1969, when it was demolished to make way for new academic facilities.\n\nThe stadium held 16,000 people at its peak and was located on the central campus just south of Zimmerman Library, where Ortega Hall, the Humanities building and Woodward Hall currently stand. It featured a three-story Pueblo Revival-style grandstand designed by John Gaw Meem on the west side of the field, located where the CERIA building currently stands. The stadium was constructed using Public Works Administration funds on the site of University Field, which had been in use by the football team since 1892.\n\nThe stadium was variously known as University Stadium, Hilltop Stadium, and Lobo Stadium until November 1946 when the athletic field was renamed Zimmerman Field in honor of James F. Zimmerman, who was president of the University from 1927 to 1944.\n\nThe stadium was also briefly the first home of the University of New Mexico School of Law, which occupied four rooms of the second floor of the grandstand from 1947 to 1952, when it moved to the first Bratton Hall, now the Economics building next to the University House.\n\n"}
