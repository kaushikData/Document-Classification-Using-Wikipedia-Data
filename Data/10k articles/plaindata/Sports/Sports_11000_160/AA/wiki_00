One woman died, and at least 1,526 people were injured.\n\nThe incident occurred at approximately 10:30 p.m. local time, about 10 minutes before the end of the match, when panic erupted among those at Piazza San Carlo, leading to a stampede. During the panic, a railing of stairs leading to an underground parking garage gave way, causing additional injuries.\n\nAlthough the panic was initially thought to be caused by the noise of firecrackers, it was later determined to be caused by a robbery attempt of shooting pepper spray into the crowd to steal valuables among the public, and someone shouting that a bomb had gone off may have fueled the panic.\n\nAfter the stampede and a subsequent evacuation, the square was left strewn with sneakers which were ripped off people's feet as they ran.\n\nOn 13 April 2018, eight people were arrested on charges of triggering mass panic to commit a robbery using pepper spray.\nOne of them confessed the crime. The suspects were identified by telephone interceptions, in one of which a gold necklace stolen in the event was mentioned.\n\nAt least 1,527 people were injured, including seven who were seriously injured. On 15 June, less than two weeks after the stampede, a 38-year-old woman, Erika Pioletti, died in hospital of her sustained injuries while another woman, Marisa Amato, became tetraplegic.\n\nSome older Juventus fans said the stampede had evoked painful memories of the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, when 39 fans, mostly Juventus supporters from Italy, were crushed against a collapsing wall in Brussels, Belgium, before the start of a match between Juventus and Liverpool.\n\nIn November 2017 the Prosecutor Office of Turin started a formal investigation involving around twenty suspects, included the mayor Chiara Appendino and the police chief Angelo Sanna.\n"}

It is a British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association and British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA) recognised school. Instructors include a three-times world champion, world record holders, British cross country champion, British distance record holder, Royal Aeroclub gold medal winner and members of the British hang gliding and paragliding team.\n\nAirways also teach paragliding, hang gliding, paramotoring and microlight flying at BHPA and BMAA schools in the Alps.\n\nHang gliding teaching is primarily through tandem aerotow flights with take off and landing both on wheels. The student and instructor clip into a tandem glider side by side and attach themselves and the glider to a tow line pulled by a high powered 'tug' microlight. The tandem hang glider is then towed to around 3000' with the instructor and student keeping in line behind the microlight. At the top of the tow the line is released and the student is taken through a number of exercises before landing the glider under instruction. Once the student has completed a number of exercises and demonstrated an ability to keep the glider in line behind the microlight on tow, and land safely, then the student progresses on to a solo, wheeled hang glider. Once a student has completed a number of solo flights and demonstrated safe tows and landings solo then they are awarded their Club Pilot Certificate (aerotow) and can progress to flying in a club rather than a school environment. Airways have developed a wheeled solo glider for the initial solo flights.\n\nAirways train pilots using a static winch for paragliding training. Compared to training on the hill this is a faster and less physically demanding way to try out paragliding as Darley Moor airfield is big enough for the winch to be moved around if the wind changes.\n\nThe course or taster starts with a full demonstration/walkthrough of the equipment, the winch commands/release etc. and how to use the radio. Students are then trained to ground-handle the wing, then the flying starts with some short low level flights before progressing to basic manoeuvres and on to high flying circuits.\n\nBy using a combination of aerotow and winch for training, pilots gain the skills necessary for flying in a club environment with winch or aerotow launching. With a hill conversion course pilots can be trained to fly from hills. Airways primarily use the Derbyshire Soaring Club sites. There are hills to suit all wind directions for both hang gliding and paragliding.\n\nParamotoring training starts with standard paragliding training on the winch before the introduction of the engine and training with power. Similarly training for powered hang gliding involves learning to fly a hang glider first before conversion to power.\n\nEither flying with a paragliding wing in a wheeled, powered buggy or in a single seat wheeled powered hang glider.\n\nThe school aircraft available for training are as follows;\n\nThe airfield has ample parking with full wheelchair and vehicle access. In the clubhouse there are male, female and disabled, showers, light refreshments, a shop and in 2011 a brand new hangar has been built.\n\nThe school offers the widest range of disabled free flight facilities of any school in the UK, using specially modified equipment to fly hang gliders, paragliders and microlight aircraft. The school has close links with the Aerobility (formerly the British Disabled Flying Association) and Flyability – charities offering support, advice and scholarships to disabled people wishing to experience or learn to fly.\n\nAirways Airsports has been chosen by the press to fly or teach presenters and journalists\n\n(2003) \"Blue Peter\" presenter Matt Baker taught to fly and makes successful tandem world record breaking flight with Airways instructor Judy Leden.\n\n(2006) An extract from BBC's Great British Summer.

It served as the country's National Paralympic Committee for many years. Problems with internal governance arose starting in the early 2000s and continued until the federation closed.\n\nFECASH was one of the organizations to support the introduction of goalball in Cameroon. They also participated in United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities activities.\n\nCameroonian Sports Federation for People with Disabilities (FECASH) was created in 1998 for people with a variety of different types of disabilities. The federation was based on Doula, and had four member organizations: Federation of Disabled Sport of Cameroon, Sports Association of Blind and Partially Sighted of Cameroon (ASAMC), National League Sports for the Deaf in Cameroon (LINASCAM), and Special Olympics Cameroon. The offices for the Federation from 1998 to early 2010 were at the personal residence of Abeng Mbozo'o, a non-disabled Cameroon doctor. Mbozo'o served as the organizations chairman, with each of the member federations being represented with a Vice President position in FECASH.\n\nFor a long while, the organization was largely run by the president after all the members resigned. During its early history, FECASH had trouble securing funding. For three years, they had an annual government grant of 4.5 million XOF (€6.854). After the initial three years, government terminated the subsidy.\n\nFECASH was founded in 1998, and became affiliated with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). At the time, the President of FECASH did not seek government approval prior to affiliating with the IPC. FECASH's original president subsequently moved to Japan. In 2004, a former FECASH Vice-President created a new NPC for Cameroon without approval from the government. He subsequently moved to the United States. In the late 2000s, a third NPC for Cameroon was then created after that called Cameroon Paralympic Club (CPC) which also failed to get government approval before trying to become the IPC recognized NPC. The CPC was led by President Etienne Songa. Songa challenged the government's claim of failure for recognition. Songa claimed that FECASH, as a result of owing the IPC money, had notified the IPC that the Cameroon Paralympic Club should be recognized as the NPC for Cameroon. Songa's statements were supported by CPC Technical Director Jean-Marie Aléokol Mabiemé. FECASH had other issues in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Having statues was a then requirement of the International Paralympic Committee to be a member of the IPC in good standing. FECASH lacked governing statues in 2008. These problems related to internal governance were one of the reasons why Cameroon was unable to inscribe any participants for the 2008 Summer Paralympics.\n\nFECASH was restructured in March 2011, before being dissolved in July 2011 as a result of Law No. 2011-18 of 15 July 2011 related to the organization and promotion of Physical and Sporting Activities. It was replaced by the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Visually Impaired (FECASDEV), the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Physically Disabled (FECASDEP), Cameroonian Federation of Sports the Intellectually Disabled (FECASDI) and the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Deaf (FECASSO). These four organizations were thane made members of the newly reformed Cameroonian Paralympic Committee.\n\nBefore the organization's dissolution, Chairman Mbozo'o blamed some of the organization's failures on the Government Minister Pierre Ismaël Bidoung Mkpatt for appointing members to FECASH's board who then were completely absent from governing the organization. He also blamed the Government not providing funding to the organization.\n\nFECASH supported the introduction of goalball in the country during the 2000s to diversify the number of sports available to people with vision impairments.\n\nFor the 2009 United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities, FECASH organized nationwide sporting activities for people with disabilities. They held three regional wheelchair basketball tournaments, with the tournaments taking place in central Cameroon, southern Cameroon and coastal Cameroon. One of these tournaments took place in Douala, on the basketball courts of Military District 2. A goalball tournament also was organized at the Sports Palace in Yaounde. Deaf soccer, handball and basketball events also took place, with the Lions Indomptables Sourd playing a friendly match against a high school team from Nkomotou. The events also served as a celebration for the national delegation who went to Niamey, Niger for the 2009 African Francophone Games for the Handicapped. The team returned having finished third in the overall medal count, winning 23 medals, 10 gold, 7 silver and 6 bronze.\n"}

{"id": "2504855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2504855", "title": "Heinie Zimmerman", "text": "Heinie Zimmerman\n\nHenry Zimmerman (February 9, 1887 – March 14, 1969), known as \"Heinie\" or \"The Great Zim\", was a professional baseball infielder. Zimmerman played in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs and New York Giants from 1907 to 1919. During his playing career, Zimmerman was primarily a third baseman, although he also played extensively at second base. He was born and died in The Bronx, New York City, and was of German ancestry. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.\n\nIn 1912, Zimmerman led the National League in batting and in home runs, but failed to win the triple crown, as Honus Wagner was thought to have led the league in RBIs, though recent research has suggested that in fact Zimmerman deserved the triple crown after all. He was also an important member of the 1908 Cubs, the last Cubs team to win the World Series prior to 2016. Zimmerman was #98 on the \"Top 100 Cubs of All Time\" list as compiled by the web site \"Bleed Cubbie Blue\".\n\nZimmerman was suspended from the New York Giants in 1919, along with his friend Hal Chase, for allegedly attempting to convince other players to fix games. Based on testimony by Giants manager John McGraw during the Black Sox Scandal hearings, Zimmerman and Chase were both indicted for bribery. Zimmerman denied McGraw's accusations, and neither he nor Chase was ever proven to be directly connected to the Black Sox, but based on a long-term pattern of corruption both were permanently banned from baseball by Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Commissioner of Baseball. According to some historians, he had been informally banned after the Giants released him. Baseball statistician Bill James has suggested that the Giants' loss to the Chicago White Sox in the 1917 World Series may have been partial motivation for Zimmerman's suspension. Zimmerman batted .120 in the Series.\n\nHowever, he is best known for an infamous rundown in the decisive game. In the fourth inning, the game was scoreless when Chicago's Eddie Collins was caught between third base and home plate. Catcher Bill Rariden ran up the line to start a rundown, expecting pitcher Rube Benton or first baseman Walter Holke to cover the plate. However, neither of them budged, and Collins blew past Rariden to score what turned out to be the Series-winning run (the White Sox won 4-2). With no one covering the plate, third baseman Zimmerman was forced to chase Collins, pawing helplessly in the air with the ball in a futile attempt to tag him. As pointed out by researcher Richard A. Smiley in SABR's 2006 edition of \"The National Pastime\", Zimmerman was long blamed for losing the game, although McGraw blamed Benton and Holke for failing to cover the plate—a serious fundamental error in baseball. The play was actually quite close, as action photos show Zimmerman leaping over the sliding Collins. A quote often attributed to Zim, but actually invented by writer Ring Lardner some years later, was that when asked about the incident Zim replied, \"Who the hell was I supposed to throw to, Klem (umpire Bill Klem, who was working the plate)?\"\n\nIn 1,456 games played, Zimmerman batted .295 (1566-5304) with 695 runs scored, 275 doubles, 105 triples, 58 home runs, 799 RBI, 175 stolen bases, an on-base percentage of .331 and a slugging percentage of .419 in 13 seasons. In 12 World Series games, he hit .163 (7-43) with 2 RBI.\n\n\n\n"}

The dollar values players were sold for in the fantasy league are used as a benchmark for readers in their own fantasy drafts.\n\nThe LABR has lost its early status as the premier experts' league, as in 1997 a rival fantasy baseball experts league, Tout Wars, was created by Ron Shandler, who was fed up with the lack of promotion USA Today gave the LABR league. \n\nThe LABR Mixed league, AL-Only league and NL-Only league are online and can be viewed by the general public.\n\nLABR uses a Ranked, Rotisserie Based Scoring System of 5 batting categories and 5 pitching categories (5x5).\n\nIf there are N teams in the LABR, N points shall be awarded for first place in a category, N-1 for second place, down to 1 point for last place. In the event of a tie, the points will be split. Points will be aggregated over all ten scoring categories (see below). The team with the most points wins. \n\nExample: LABR has 15 teams. Team A has the most home runs, and is awarded 15 points in that category. Teams B and C are tied for second in home runs; they split the second and third place points, and each receive 13.5 points. If a team finished first in all 10 categories, it would receive a total of 15*10=150 points. If it finished last in all categories, it would receive 1*10=10 points. \nIn the case of ties in total points, the final places in the standings are determined by comparing the placement of the teams in the individual categories. The team ahead in a category is given a point. This is done over all categories. The team with the most points is declared the winner. Should the teams still be tied after this process, then the final result shall be declared a tie. \n\nBatting Categories \n\nPitching Categories\n\nEach team will be required to attain a minimum of 950 innings pitched in order to qualify for placement in the pitching categories of; a) Ratio and b) Earned Run Average, and a minimum of 4,200 at-bats for placement in the batting average category. If these minimum innings or at-bats are not achieved the team will receive 1 point in these categories and every team that meets the minimum innings pitched or at-bats will be ranked in the standings with 15 points for 1st place and so on until all qualifying teams have received points.\n\nRosters shall consist of a lineup of 23 players and a bench of 6 reserve players.\n\nA team's active roster consists of the following players: 5 outfielders, 2 catchers, 1 second baseman, 1 shortstop, 1 middle infielder (either second baseman or shortstop), 1 first baseman, 1 third baseman, 1 corner infielder (first or third baseman), one utility player who may be of any position and 9 pitchers (who may be either starters, relievers or both). \n\nThere will also be six reserve players on each team's roster to be selected on draft day. Players who go onto the disabled list may also be reserved on a separate list. There is no limit to the number of disabled list players that can exist on a roster. \n\nOnly members of the active roster generate statistics.\n"}

They are unusual in Argentina in that they do not have a nickname. It is considered as the largest and strongest barra brava in Argentina. The existence of this group has been publicly known since the 1950s. Besides attending Independiente matches, since 1982, the core members of the group attend the national team's World Cups. They also attended some times the Copa América.\n\nAlthough La Barra Del Rojo work as a united group, it consists of a large number of sub-groups, which come from neighborhoods throughout Avellaneda, the rest of the Greater Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, La Plata and the Greater La Plata. These sub-groups generally carry the names of their neighborhoods or cities of origin, or the nicknames of their bosses. The most important are: \"Fiorito\", \"La Tranquila\", \"La Banda de San Justo\", \"Los Polacos\", \"Los camioneros\", \"Villa Corina\", \"Los Rana\", \"Los Bera\", \"Los Narigones\", \"Los Gerlis\", \"La 4 de Julio\", \"La Pepsi\", etc.; all of them come from the most dangerous \"villas miserias\" and poor neighborhoods of cities like Avellaneda, Buenos Aires, San Justo, Berazategui, Sarandí, Merlo, Villa Domínico, Wilde, Lanús, Claypole, Quilmes, Villa Fiorito, Lomas de Zamora, Banfield, La Plata, etc.\n\nWithin the barra brava, there is a pecking order. The \"first line\", consisting in fewer than 10 persons, is formed by the bosses (headed by the leader), who are the chiefs of the major sub-groups. A requisite for becoming a boss is to have been a member of the group for at least 10 years. They are responsible for the organization and the distribution of money and tasks within the barra brava. The \"second line\", ranging from 15 to 30 people, is formed by the chiefs and important members of the rest of the sub-groups. They take care of recruiting people, study the area and the movements of the enemy barras bravas, and hire buses for the transfer of group members. The \"third line\", consisting of about 400 people, it consists of the following members in the range, behind the leaders in each sub-groups. They already have some years in the barra brava, but are not yet part of the core. They handle the drums and flags. The \"fourth line\", or rest of the barra brava, (over 1000 people), is responsible simply to follow the above \"lines\", and can not make decisions. Everybody is in a sub-group and when there is a fight against another barra brava; all the \"lines\" must participate.\n\nMost members of La Barra Del Rojo form part of the working class. The current leader of the barra brava is Pablo \"Bebote\" (\"Big Baby\") Álvarez, who took the lead in 2004.\n\nTheir main means of financing include the resale of tickets, drugs, the role of one sub-group as \"shock troop\" for some political unions (CGT and the Syndicate of Truck Drivers), and threatening the directors and players of the club.\n\nAccording to 2006 research reports, \"Polaco\" (the chief of the sub-group \"Los Polacos\" and one of the leaders of Los Diablos Rojos) was the bodyguard of Hugo Moyano (the secretary general of the CGT) 15 years ago and still holds that role.\n\nIn 2003, an investigation said that the barra brava earned between 40000 and 45000 pesos per month.\n\nDuring its existence, the barra brava has had several fights and altercations with the Argentine police and with other barras bravas, especially with that of Racing de Avellaneda (La Guardia Imperial), Independiente's main football rival; it also had major confrontations with the barras bravas of Boca Juniors (La 12), River Plate (Los Borrachos del Tablón) and San Lorenzo de Almagro (La Gloriosa), also rivals of the club. However, any barra brava of other team is targeted as an enemy, even if there is no football-related rivalry.\n\nOn 17 October 2006, during the procession for the transfer of the coffin of ex-president Juan Domingo Perón from the La Chacarita cemetery (in the city of Buenos Aires) to a mausoleum in a summer residence in San Vicente, some members of La Barra Del Rojo became involved (among them Jorge \"Madonna\" Quiroz) in a fight instigated by Peronist trade unions over access to the ceremony (some sub-groups of the barra brava belong to the CGT and the Syndicate of Truck Drivers, both Peronist). Is believed that the fight started because there were several members of the barras bravas of Estudiantes de La Plata and Defensores de Cambaceres in the UOCRA (another Peronist union then present). The police were able to contain the violence enough for the ceremony to finish.\n\nIn 1997, a member of La Barra Del Rojo was indicted for the murder of Walter Rodríguez, and in 2001, the death of another fan of Racing Club was attributed to the barra brava. Both victims were members of La Guardia Imperial.\n\nIn 2004 in Quito, Ecuador, the barra brava fought the Ecuadorian police during a Copa Libertadores match between El Nacional and Independente in the Atahualpa stadium. As a result of the incident, two supporters of Independiente was arrested. They were released two days later.\n\n"}

It opened in 1974, during the Marquette Iron Rangers hockey season. The team had previously played in the historic Palestra, a building that had moved from Laurium, Michigan in 1921 and was torn down shortly after Lakeview opened. From 1976 to 1999, it was the home of Northern Michigan University's hockey program, and it was there, during the 1990–91 season, that the Wildcats posted a perfect home record on their way to the 1991 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament.\n\nKISS performed at the arena during their Animalize Tour on March 20, 1985, during their Crazy Nights Tour on January 5, 1988, and during their Hot in The Shade Tour on October 4, 1990. Today, the building is used for local hockey programs, as well as other events and conventions in the city. It was also home to the Marquette Rangers of the NAHL between 2006 and 2010, before they moved to Flint. It became home to the newly revived Marquette Iron Rangers in the Great Lakes Hockey League's 2015-16 season.

One of the classes is the ultralight glider. These are defined as gliders with a take-off mass not exceeding 220 kg (486 lb). Examples of these are the Apis and Silent 2. Microlift gliders are a sub-type of the ultralight class, further defined by a wing loading that does not exceed 18 kg/m² (3.69 lb/ft).These definitions were adopted for inclusion in the Sporting Code, Section 3, Gliding, effective on October 1, 2004.\n\nWorld records for the ultralight class have been recognized by the FAI but there are no World Championships for these types at present. For world records microlift gliders are classed with the other ultralight gliders and/or hang gliders.\n\nThe FAI has produced a loaded weight versus wing loading diagram defining the different domains for glider classes.\n\nIn addition to the traditional forms of lift used in the sport of gliding, microlift gliding also aims to exploit non-traditional sources of weak lift. In typical conditions, conventional sailplanes may be unable to exploit weak vertical movements of air. However a microlift glider that is specifically designed to have a very low rate of sink and a very small circling radius, may be able to exploit these feeble air movements for sustained flight and may even allow the glider to climb.\n\n"}
{"id": "758521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=758521", "title": "Mile High Stadium", "text": "Mile High Stadium\n\nMile High Stadium (originally Bears Stadium) was an outdoor multi-purpose stadium located in Denver, Colorado.\n\nThe stadium was built in 1948 to accommodate the Denver Bears baseball team, which was a member of the Western League during its construction. Originally designed as a baseball venue, the stadium was expanded in later years to accommodate the addition of a professional football team to the city, the Denver Broncos, as well as to improve Denver's hopes of landing a Major League Baseball team. Although the stadium was originally built as a baseball-specific venue, it became more popular as a pro-football stadium despite hosting both sports for a majority of its life.\n\nThe Broncos called Mile High Stadium home from their beginning in the AFL in 1960 until 2000. The Bears, who changed their name to the Zephyrs in 1985, continued to play in the stadium until 1992 when the franchise was moved to New Orleans. The move was precipitated by the awarding of a Major League Baseball franchise to the city of Denver, and in 1993 the Colorado Rockies season opened in Mile High. The team played the 1993 and strike-shortened 1994 seasons in Mile High setting MLB attendance records while Coors Field was being constructed in downtown Denver.\n\nIn addition to the Broncos, Bears/Zephyrs, and Rockies, Mile High Stadium was home to several other professional teams during the course of its history. The Denver Gold of the United States Football League called Mile High home from 1983 to 1985, and the stadium played host to the inaugural USFL championship game on July 17, 1983. Two professional soccer teams also played at Mile High. The first was the Denver Dynamos of the North American Soccer League, who were founded in 1974 and played their first two seasons in Denver before moving to Bloomington, Minnesota and becoming the Minnesota Kicks. Denver was home to one of Major League Soccer's 10 charter franchises as the Colorado Rapids were formed and played in Mile High from 1996 until 2001, making them the last franchise to play in Mile High Stadium prior to its closure.\n\nAfter the Rapids' 2001 season, Mile High Stadium was closed and in 2002 the stadium was demolished.\n\nMile High Stadium was originally built as Bears Stadium for minor league baseball by Bob Howsam in 1948 at the site of a former landfill. The stadium initially consisted of a single 18,000-seat grandstand stretching along the north side from the left field foul pole to the right field foul pole on the west side. Luther \"Bud\" Phillips hit the first official home run out of Bears Stadium. In its first full season in 1949, the Bears averaged over 6,600 per game to lead the minor leagues in attendance.\n\nIn the late 1950s, there was an attempt to form a third major league, the Continental League, helmed by former Dodger general manager Branch Rickey. Howsam, who had worked with Rickey years before with the St. Louis Cardinals, joined ranks with Rickey, pleading for a major league team in Denver. Advised that to get a major league franchise Denver would need a much larger ballpark, Bears Stadium would begin the first of its many expansions. Over 8,000 seats were added to the south stands, bringing stadium capacity to 23,100.\n\nMajor League Baseball's (MLB) answer to the Continental League was to expand its two Leagues, which would eventually lead to the folding of the Continental League. Although Denver was not awarded a franchise, MLB promised teams in the future for Denver and other cities. Howsam was now trapped with a massive debt load and a stadium far too big for a minor-league team. Frantically searching for a solution, he concluded the only way out was to extend the stadium's season with football.\n\nA large bleacher section was added along the south side and temporary east stands were built in 1960, raising the capacity to 34,657.\n\nHowsam's ownership in the AFL was short-lived, as overwhelming debt forced Howsam to sell all his sports interests in 1961. His dream of major league baseball in Denver would be placed on hold for another 30 years.\n\nOne condition of including Denver in the AFL–NFL merger announced in 1966 was expanding Bears Stadium to at least 50,000 seats. This required adding second and third decks along the west sideline (first base line). This expansion was completed in 1968, when the stadium was sold to the city of Denver, which renamed it Mile High Stadium and built the upper deck along the west side, thus raising capacity to 50,657.\n\nEarly '70s expansion\n\nThe Broncos sold out every game in their inaugural NFL season. Every Broncos game—preseason, regular season (not including games with replacement players) and playoffs—has been sold out since, a streak that continued after the Broncos left Mile High. As ticket sales increased, the stadium expanded to 51,706 seats. With a $25 million bond issue in 1974 another stadium renovation added more seats. By 1976, seating was up to 63,532 as the upper decks construction was completed along the north end zone (third base line).\n\nThe east stands\n\nAn ingenious expansion that took place from 1975–1977 raised the capacity to 75,103 by extending the upper deck that was along the north side and building movable, triple-decked stands along the east side. When fully retracted toward the field, the stands would form a horseshoe for football, appropriate considering the team was the Denver Broncos. Yet when fully extended by 145 feet (44 m), the stadium could still fit a normal-sized baseball field with outfield distances of 335 feet down the left-field line, 375 feet to left-center and 423 to center field.\n\nThe movable structure was 450 feet (137 m) long, 200 feet (61 m) wide, and weighed nearly 9 million pounds (4,500 short tons, 4,000 metric tons). When a game or event required moving the stands the 145 feet in or out, engineers pumped water into 163 water bearings spaced out beneath the stands, lifting the structure off its foundation. A sheet of water ⅓-inch thick formed under the structure. Hydraulic rams then pushed the stands forward at the rate of two feet per minute, taking stadium engineers about six hours from start to finish to move the stands.\n\nThe south stands\n\nThe south stands of Mile High Stadium had, for many years, a reputation for having the most vociferous fans. While not matching other cities' stadiums for rowdiness or bad behavior, the south stands ticketholders nevertheless represented some of the Broncos' most ardent fans who were able to generate an outsized impact on the noise level of the stadium despite the open gaps between the south stands and the east and west stands.\n\nBucky Bronco\n\nIn 1975, Denver approached actor Roy Rogers to commission a statue of his horse, Trigger, for display at the stadium. A 24-foot, 1,300-pound fiberglass replica of the horse had previously been produced for the Roy Rogers Museum in Victorville, California. Rogers agreed, with the stipulation that the new statue not be named \"Trigger\". Denver fans were polled by \"The Denver Post\" to decide on a different name, and \"Bucky\" was chosen. Painted white to match the Broncos logo, the statue was mounted atop the scoreboard at Mile High, where it remained for 25 years before being relocated to the new stadium. Mounted, the statue measures 27-feet and 1,600 pounds.\n\nMile High Stadium, in the 1970s and 1980s, was the only professional-caliber baseball facility to have an all grass infield, with sliding pits around bases. This unique feature was similar to several newer Major League Baseball stadiums that also used sliding pits, except those other stadiums all had artificial turf infields. In 1986, 77 luxury suites were added atop the west stands, increasing the official seating capacity to 76,123.\n\nThe stadium's large capacity combined with enthusiasm for the new team and the lowest MLB ticket prices allowed the expansion Rockies to set Major League Baseball attendance records before moving to Coors Field for the 1995 season. The stadium was known for its loudness with the sound of fans stomping in the bleachers echoing within the horseshoe. The large center and right fields, foul territory areas (although left field was shorter than average), and center field's 30-foot (10 m) high fence, was not as problematic for pitchers as Coors Field would be. The club's 1993 season attendance was 4,483,350 in 79 home dates (81 games – 2 doubleheaders), an average of 56,751 per home date. The Rockies were on pace to exceed the record during the strike-shortened 1994 season. They had drawn 3,281,511 in 57 home dates (also 57 games), an average of 57,570 per home date. (Season attendance figures from \"The Sporting News Baseball Record Book\", 2007, p. 234; Game counts are from game logs on Retrosheet.)\n\nThe final football game at Mile High Stadium was December 23, 2000, in which the Broncos routed the 49ers, 38–9. The Broncos had defeated every visiting franchise from the stadium's opening to close, enjoying perfect records against the Arizona Cardinals (3-0), Baltimore Ravens (1-0), Carolina Panthers (1-0), Green Bay Packers (5-0), and Indianapolis Colts (5-0).\n\nThe Colorado Rapids were the final professional team to play in Mile High Stadium, their home since 1996. Team Captain John Spencer that year became the first Rapids player ever to record a hat trick when he scored three times against Chicago in a 3-1 win in the Rapids' annual Independence Day blowout celebration at Mile High Stadium on July 4 in front of 60,500 fans.The Rapids played the last ever professional sporting event ever held at Mile High on September 8 of this year, a 2-0 loss to the LA Galaxy. The Rapids were scheduled to play the first ever professional sports event ever held in Invesco Field at Mile High soon after, but the match was cancelled following the terrorist attacks on September 11.\n\nMile High Stadium was closed in 2001, after the Colorado Rapids and Denver Broncos moved to neighboring Broncos Stadium at Mile High (then known as Invesco Field at Mile High), upon completion of the new stadium. The demolition of Mile High Stadium began in January 2002, an event covered extensively by local newspapers and broadcast live on television. The demolition was performed by Spirtas Wrecking Company of St. Louis, Mo., the same group that led the demolition of arenas and stadiums in St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Seattle. The stadium demolition was completed by April.\n\nThe former stadium is now a parking lot for Broncos Stadium at Mile High. The historical site of many games and events for 40 years is marked by the hills forming the west and north stands, the corner between them descended by a staircase, much as the stands were. The location of home plate is identified by a marker located at .\n\nJune 27, 28 and 29, 1969, concert promoter Barry Fey held The Denver Pop Festival at Mile High Stadium with many well known acts performing every evening. The city of Denver supported the festival and made available areas for camping and other services. The Denver Police however allowed non-ticket holders to enter the parking area whereupon they attempted to climb over chain link fencing to see the show while claiming that music should be \"free\". Police responded by lobbing tear gas canisters toward the fences knowing full well that the gas would affect everyone in attendance at the outdoor venue. Sunday night's final act was The Jimi Hendrix Experience which proved to be the Experience' final performance as a trio. The Denver Police were, somehow, complicit in the break up of the band. Bassist Noel Redding quit and simply flew back to England that night. Jimi did not perform again for 6 weeks until mid August when he closed The Woodstock Music and Art Fair with his new band. Jimi Hendrix died 13 months later in September 1970. Denver Police mourned. \n\nLynyrd Skynyrd played at the Stadium June 27, 1976, as part of their One More From The Road tour.\n\nThe Jacksons performed two concerts at Mile High Stadium on September 7 and 8, 1984 during their Victory Tour.\n\nThe stadium was the penultimate stop on Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band's Born in the U.S.A. Tour, where they performed two shows on September 23 and 24, 1985.\n\nThe stadium hosted the final show of The 1988 Monsters of Rock Festival Tour, featuring Van Halen, Metallica, Scorpions, Dokken and Kingdom Come, on July 30, 1988.\n\nMetallica and Guns N' Roses brought the Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour to the stadium on September 19, 1992, with Body Count as their opening act.\n\nOn October 21, 1992, U2 performed at Mile High as part of the third leg of their Zoo TV Tour. U2 would return again to perform in concert May 1, 1997 on the first leg of their PopMart Tour.\n\nThe stadium played host to Ozzfest on June 24, 1997.\n\nThe stadium again hosted Ozzfest, for the second and last time, on June 21, 2001 and hosted the Area:One Festival on July 28, 2001.\n\nThe stadium was featured in Michael Moore's 2002 documentary \"Bowling for Columbine\" as the backdrop for Moore's interview with controversial rock musician Marilyn Manson during the 2001 Ozzfest tour.\n\nBilly Graham held his \"Rocky Mountain Crusade\" at the stadium in 1987.\n\nIn August 1993, Denver hosted World Youth Day. On August 12 and 13, Mile High Stadium hosted two events with Pope John Paul II, the Papal Welcoming Ceremony and the Way of the Cross.\n\n\n"}

Peter Shilton currently holds the most appearances in the PFA Team of the Year in the top division with 10 appearances. Steven Gerrard currently holds the most appearances in the PFA Team of the Year in the Premier League era with eight appearances.\n\nThe award has been presented since the 1973–74 season and the shortlist is compiled by the members of the players' trade union, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), in January of every year, with the winners then being voted for by the other players in their respective divisions. The award is regarded by players in the Football League as the highest accolade available to them, due to it being picked by their fellow professionals. Oxford United's Damian Batt, who was named in the Team of the Year for League Two in 2011, said he was \"very pleased to be given such a prestigious award. It is something that I am very proud of\". In 2014, a team for female players competing in the FA WSL was selected for the first time.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1887827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887827", "title": "Pickleball", "text": "Pickleball\n\nPickleball is a paddle sport (similar to a racquet sport) that combines elements of badminton, tennis, and table tennis. Two or four players use solid paddles made of wood or composite materials to hit a perforated polymer ball, similar to a Wiffle Ball, over a net. The sport shares features of other racquet sports, the dimensions and layout of a badminton court, and a net and rules somewhat similar to tennis, with several modifications. Pickleball was invented in the mid 1960s as a children's backyard pastime.\n\nThe game started during the summer of 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington, at the home of former State Representative Joel Pritchard who, in 1972, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and eventually went on to become Lieutenant Governor of Washington. He and two of his friends, Bill Bell and Barney McCallum, returned from golf and found their families bored one Saturday afternoon. They attempted to set up badminton, but no one could find the shuttlecock. They improvised with a Wiffle ball, lowered the badminton net, and fabricated paddles of plywood from a nearby shed. Para-Pickleball, or wheel chair pickleball, was officially recognized as a competitive branch of Pickleball by the USA Pickleball Association in 2016.\n\nSome sources claim that the name \"Pickleball\" was derived from that of the Pritchard's family dog, Pickles, or from the term \"pickle boat\", referring to the last boat to return with its catch. But according to Joan Pritchard, Joel Pritchard's wife, the name came \"after I said it reminded me of the Pickle Boat in crew where oarsmen were chosen from the leftovers of other boats. Somehow the idea the name came from our dog Pickles was attached to the naming of the game, but Pickles wasn't on the scene for two more years. The dog was named from the game.\"\n\nThe pickleball court is similar to a doubles badminton court. The actual size of the court is 20×44 feet for both doubles and singles. The net is hung at 36 inches on the ends, and 34 inches at center. The court is striped like a tennis court, with no alleys; but the outer courts, and not the inner courts, are divided in half by service lines. The inner courts are non-volley zones and extend 7 feet from the net on either side.\n\nThe ball is served with an underhand stroke so that contact with the ball is made below waist level (waist is defined as the navel level) in an upward arc. The server hits from behind the baseline on one side of the center line and aims diagonally to the opponent’s service zone (as in the figure on the right). \n\nOnly the serving side may score a point. Play ends for a point when one side commits a \"fault\". Faults include:\n\nA player may enter the non-volley zone to play a ball that bounces and may stay there to play balls that bounce. The player must exit the non-volley zone before playing a volley.\n\nThe first side scoring 11 points leading by at least two points wins the game. If the two sides are tied at 10 points apiece, the side that goes ahead by two points wins the game.\n\nTournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points with players rotating sides at 8 or 11 total points respectively.\n\nThe server or server and partner usually stay at the baseline until the first return has been hit back and bounced once.\n\nAt the beginning of a doubles game before any serving, the score is 0-0. Then the side serving first gets only one fault before their side is \"out\", meaning that their opponents serve next. After the first fault each side gets 2 faults (one for each team member serving) before their side is \"out\".\n\nIn singles play, each side gets only one fault before a side out and the opponent then serves. The server's score will always be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...) when serving from the right side, and odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9...) when serving from the left side (singles play only).\n\nRules for those in wheelchairs are similar to the standing rules with minor alternatives. The player’s wheelchair is considered to be part of the player’s body and all applicable rules that usually apply to the body will also apply to the player’s wheelchair. A pickleball player in a wheelchair is allowed two bounces instead of the one a standup player would receive. When a player in a wheelchair is serving the ball, they must be in a stationary position. They are then allowed one push before striking the ball for service. When the player strikes the ball, the wheels of the wheel chair shall not touch any baselines, sidelines, center lines or the extended center or sidelines. When there is a mixed game of those in wheelchairs and those standing, the applicable rules apply for those players respectively. Standing players will adhere to the standing pickleball rules and the wheelchair players will adhere to the wheelchair pickleball rules.\n\n\n"}

It is the home of Dartford. Thamesmead Town were also sharing the ground with Dartford since 2017 until going out of business in October 2018. The stadium's postcode is DA1 1RT, the closest possible representation of the word \"Dart\". DA1 1FC was unobtainable, as the letter C is not allocated for use at the end of British postcodes. The stadium is owned by Dartford Borough Council.\n\nConstruction work began on 14 November 2005. Designed by Alexander Sedgley architects, the stadium has a capacity of 4,100 (642 seated), and has been described as one of the most ecologically sound ever built. The pitch level is sunk two meters below the external ground level to reduce noise and light pollution. It is estimated to have cost around £7 million. The stadium was opened on 11 November 2006 when Dartford FC, who had been without a home ground in the borough since 1992, beat Horsham YMCA 4-2 in an Isthmian League Division One South league fixture, in front of a capacity 4,097 crowd.\n\nThe stadium roof has a sedum roof blanket, a living roof that provides a natural air filtration system. solar panels on the roof serve the community changing areas and public toilets hot water storage cylinders. The roof is supported by treated Glulam timber beams. Water recycling system which serves the toilets within the clubhouse. Rain water is collected in the two large ponds at the north end of the stadium grounds. Underfloor heating on both levels of the clubhouse. Low energy lighting. Increased fabric insulation to give the clubhouse better thermal retention and efficiency. Condensing boilers to provide a more energy efficient system. Also excavated earth was reused for landscaping the external courtyard areas around the stadium.\n\nPrinces Park has an all-weather training pitch available for community use, and the stadium's clubhouse which contains bars, banqueting suites and meeting rooms.\n\nLocated close to Dartford town centre and the M25 motorway, Princes Park is also served by a dedicated \"Fastrack\" bus stop. The use of public transport for travel to the stadium is encouraged, although there is a dedicated car park with spaces for up to 300 vehicles. Vehicle access is via Grassbanks, a new road named by the winner of a local newspaper competition. On non-matchdays, this is available for use as a \"park and ride\" station for users of the Fastrack bus service.\n\nSports played at the stadium include \n\nThe stadium has received a number of commendations for its design and environmentally friendly features. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors acknowledged the stadium for being \"green\", and the venue has received significant publicity in the national press. Princes Park was the winner of the GT Ground Awards, \"Best New Non-League Ground\" award. saying, \"Let's hope other forward-thinking councils will follow their lead.\" On Sky Sports \"Soccer AM\" show in April 2007, Fashion designer and architect Wayne Hemingway said of Princes Park \"It’s got a grass roof all the way around the outside, it’s got solar panels it’s totally sustainable and creates its own electricity. That’s the way that buildings should go, it’s just fantastic, and it’s definitely the best stadium in the country.\" Adding that \"the absolute number one new stadium in the country is from a club that is in the conference - Dartford\" ahead of Arsenal's Emirates Stadium and the new Wembley Stadium.\n\n"}

It is currently used mostly for rugby union matches and is the home stadium of RC Toulonnais. The stadium is able to hold 18,200 people.\nIt is one of the few French stadiums to be embedded in the city and surrounded by high buildings. It was built at the foot of the Mont Faron, the hill on which Toulon is partly built, and overlooks the Toulon military harbour (\"La Rade\") on the Mediterranean.\n\nIt is named after Félix Mayol, a very popular concert hall singer from Toulon who had succeeded in Paris in the early 20th century. A true-blue city boy, he offered to buy a piece of land for the club on which the stadium would be built. And so he did. He gave his personal money and gave up the rights on some of his songs to raise the rest. The least that could be done was to give the place the name of its generous patron.\n\nIt was inaugurated on March 28, 1920 by the mayor of Toulon and Félix Mayol himself. A cross-country race was organised, as well as a soccer match between Stade Raphaëlois from Saint-Raphaël and the RC Toulon football team (4-0) and a rugby match between RCT and TOEC from Toulouse (3-3).\n\nAll Blacks and Wallaby tourists played matches there against regional South-East selections.\n\nThe atmosphere is famous for a specific chant called \"Pilou pilou\", created at the end of the 1940s by a club player, Marcel Bodrero, which describes the Toulon players as terrible primitive warriors coming down from the mountain towards the sea (exactly what Toulon's topography is). A cheerleader leads the chants and asks fans to answer and repeat the words. It generally comes up when players get on the pitch, then early in the game and also when the team's forwards, the club's historical \"forte\", start to dominate. The chant may also occasionally be heard after the game. The club president Mourad Boudjellal famously led the \"Pilou pilou\" after a Toulon home victory over Racing Métro in 2008 that secured Toulon's promotion to the Top 14.\n"}
