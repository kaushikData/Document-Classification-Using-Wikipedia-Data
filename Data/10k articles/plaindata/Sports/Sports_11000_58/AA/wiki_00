Louth were appearing in their first Leinster Senior Football Championship Final in 50 years. The game is memorable for its controversial ending.\n\nMeath won by 1–12 to 1–10, thanks to a controversial late goal by Joe Sheridan. The goal was deemed illegal by television replays but was declared valid by referee Martin Sludden, from County Tyrone. He then blew the final whistle. Irate Louth fans stormed the pitch and commenced a process of chasing and physically assaulting the referee, who had to be led away by a Garda escort in scenes broadcast to a live television audience. Other scenes of violence saw bottles being hurled from a stand, one striking a steward who fell to the ground. The situation led to much media debate in the week that followed, the violence was condemned by senior politicians (some of whom were in the stadium), and there were calls for the game to be replayed—though, ultimately, this did not happen.\n\nSeán Moran of \"The Irish Times\" said the next day: \"What will be most vividly remembered of the 2010 final was compressed into a minute at the very end of the match with Louth getting ready to celebrate a deserved win – first over their neighbours in 35 years – and a resilient display\". Colm Keys of the \"Irish Independent\" said it was \"hard to disagree\" that it was \"the greatest injustice for many a year in Croke Park\", and remarked: \"The 320th anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne is being commemorated today, but that surely didn't throw up a talking point to match a Joe Sheridan goal that will have the counties divided by the same river at odds for years to come\".\n\nLouth and Meath were rivals of old, both winning the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in the 1950s; however, this was to be Louth's first appearance in the Leinster Senior Football Championship Final since a 1960 to Offaly. According to Colm O'Rourke, \"there was a time in the late 1940s and '50s when Meath and Louth were the two best teams in the province [of Leinster] and played some memorable championship games\". Keith Duggan of \"The Irish Times\" reported that the two teams \"fight like alley cats\". They had last met four years previously in a preliminary round of the Leinster Senior Football Championship, with Meath emerging victorious. Louth had last defeated Meath in 1975, also at Croke Park. Three matches were required to produce a winner when the two encountered each other in July 1949. Other meetings include a draw in a semi-final of the 1951 Leinster Senior Football Championship, with Meath narrowly winning the replay. Meath also defeated Louth in the 1952 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final. Following on from Louth's aforementioned 1975 victory, there were other Meath wins in 1998, 2002 and 2006.\n\nPreliminary Round: Louth 1–11 Longford 1–7; Meath 1–20 Offaly 2–7\nQuarter-finals: Louth 1–22 Kildare 1–16; Meath 2–14 Laois 0–10\nSemi-finals: Louth 1–15 Westmeath 2–10; Meath 5–9 Dublin 0–13\n\nOn 9 July, both teams announced their teams for the final. Meath announced their team first, with captain Nigel Crawford, returning after injury, replacing Mark Ward in midfield.\n\nIt was anticipated beforehand that attendance would be at its lowest of the decade, estimated at 45,000 or 50,000 by Ian O'Riordan of \"The Irish Times\". 48,875 people attended the game. The issue of applying fencing around Croke Park to prevent pitch invasions had been discussed prior to the game. The violent scenes which followed the 2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final renewed this debate in the days afterwards, though President Cooney later said \"the last thing we want to do is put fencing up around Croke Park\".\n\nLouth's JP Rooney and Shane Lennon both missed opportunities in the first half. Louth dominated the second half, though spurned numerous opportunities to take a commanding lead over Meath. Rooney scored a goal with seven minutes of the game left. Meath converted two long-range free kicks from Cian Ward, but Louth still led by one point in the final minute. Louth's Colm Judge was sent off in the 69th minute for a second bookable offence. Then came the controversial goal by Joe Sheridan in the third minute of stoppage time. The ball was kicked into the square by Graham Reilly. It came out to Seamus Kenny, who could have gone for the point, but saw a goal chance and shot. But the ball was blocked by Louth captain Paddy Keenan, and fell into the square, towards Louth full-back Dessie Finnegan. But Finnegan failed to clear and the ball went straight to Joe Sheridan, who fell over the goal line and then threw the ball into the net – both illegal moves. Sheridan was also \"inside the square\" at the time the ball reached him, in a third illegal move. Yet the goal was allowed and all of a sudden Meath were winning by two points. Referee Sludden checked with the umpire and did not change his mind, blowing his whistle for full-time soon after with the score at Meath 1–12: Louth 1–10, much to the disappointment of everyone associated with Louth. TV replays immediately demonstrated that the referee was incorrect when he awarded the goal to Meath.\n\nLouth fans poured onto the pitch to express their feelings to the referee, and, in the words of \"The Irish Times\", \"all hell broke loose\". At least four fans physically attacked Sludden and struck him with violence. One man who was wearing a red shirt shoved Sludden in the chest before being pursued by television cameras as he made his departure. Sludden was awarded a Garda escort as he made haste his escape from the pitch. Stadium director Peter McKenna said the referee was \"very shaken\" after his experience.\n\nLouth manager Peter Fitzpatrick intervened to physically urge the fans to halt their behaviour, an act later described by the \"Irish Independent\" as \"a remarkable display of composure from the Dundalk man, who had every right to be spitting feathers at the defeat\". Meath substitute Mark Ward was hit by a Louth fan. Children cried and looked sad, and one child allegedly received a wound when hit by a steward. Bottles were hurled from the stands. A steward also received wounds when he was assaulted by a soft drinks bottle. He was given medical attention, and later declared fit to steward further matches.\n\nElsewhere in the stadium, former Meath All-Ireland Senior Football Championship-winning manager Seán Boylan was involved in an altercation with an irate Louth fan in a corporate box. Boylan said: \"People lose the head all the time\" and that he was \"more embarrassed than anything\".\n\nJoe Sheridan, who scored the controversial goal, described how he had done it: \"It was well-worked and it was a definite goal. People are saying I threw it in, but I was heading for the line and I just dropped the ball and it was in the net. I got it and the lad just pushed me into the net. I tried to do whatever I could to hit it and the goal was given, simple as that. I was pushed in over the line so it should have been a penalty anyway. I think it was a perfect goal\".\n\nReferee Martin Sludden later admitted he had made an error. His referee's report acknowledged a \"terrible mistake\". However, based on past refereeing errors, his place on the panel of 18 referees to officiate during the 2010 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship was secure, though the likelihood of him refereeing another match was less so. It was thought likely he had been deducted four points from one hundred for his error by his assessor (1 for missing a foul and 3 for Meath profiting from it with a score), though rules banning the assessor from looking at video evidence meant Sludden may not have been deducted any points if the assessor could not see the incident properly from the stand.\n\nLouth manager Peter Fitzpatrick said he was \"absolutely devastated\" on RTÉ. Appearing later on radio station LMFM, he described the referee as \"Dick Turpin without a mask\", adding \"It was pure daylight robbery. I'm very, very annoyed\".\n\nWhen questioned at a press conference about Sheridan's goal, Meath manager Eamon O'Brien said: \"I can't say and I'm not commenting. I can comment, as I said to RTÉ, that loads of decisions were made during the game that didn't go our way. I can recall three or four balls that were blown for picking off the ground that I didn’t think were off the ground. Nigel Crawford was booked up here and Louth got a point off it. The game goes for 70 minutes, decisions are made and you live with it. That’s it, that’s the way I see it\".\n\nMeath's captain Nigel Crawford gave his opinion on the incident: \"I'm sure most players have been involved in controversial situations like that where you get calls for replays and things like that happening, but I just don't think it's possible or I just don't think it can happen. If you start that, where do you end up? Do we go back and say the ball wasn’t on the ground when we touched it and they got a free or whatever? It's just very unfortunate that it happens in a high-profile game right at the end of a game to a team that hasn't won in a long time. It's just a very unfortunate situation\".\n\nLouth player J. P. Rooney said: \"Aaron Hoey was pleading with [Sludden] to consult with his umpires but when he went in, he told them to put up the green flag. [...] I know it's wrong, people running at the ref, but you can see why Louth people did it. He brought it on himself and I wouldn't feel sorry for him\".\n\nThe \"Irish Independent\" said \"Meath's Leinster Final goal-that-never-was will go down in history – and not only in Ireland, since by now the images have flashed round the world – among the great injustices suffered in any sport\". \"The Irish Times\" described \"ugly scenes\", with Damian Cullen calling it \"one of the strangest endings ever to a GAA match\", Seán Moran describing it as \"the most extraordinary refereeing error since Jimmy Cooney whistled up early 12 years ago\", and the newspaper publishing numerous letters on the topic from disgruntled members of the public every day that week. The same newspaper's Philip Reid remarked upon the coincidence that these events had occurred on the same day as the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final in South Africa, wondered why goal-line technology could not be used and added: \"On this point, it would appear, the GAA and FIFA have something in common: they live in the times of the dinosaur\". The events in Croke Park led to less prominent newspaper coverage of the FIFA World Cup Final itself the next day. The incident surrounding the goal was likened to Thierry Henry's illegal handball in the France vs Republic of Ireland 2010 FIFA World Cup play-off. Public service broadcaster RTÉ referred to \"disgraceful scenes\". The GAA website's official match report brushed aside the controversy, saying Sheridan had \"smuggled the ball over the line\". Eugene McGee, writing in the \"Irish Independent\", said \"It will be a stain on the good name of the GAA if this result is allowed to stand\". His colleague Martin Breheny said there ought to be no replay and that \"no sport can run its affairs on the basis of sentiment\".\n\nThe following day, the GAA released a statement confirming that Sludden admitted he had made an error. The GAA also stated that the rules left it powerless to offer a replay and that this would be decided by Meath, though most Meath players did not wish to facilitate a replay, while former Meath players were said to be in favour of one. The GAA said it would work with the authorities to capture Sludden's attackers.\n\nGAA President Christy Cooney said the events were a \"watershed\" and one where the \"circumstances were bizarre. I have never seen circumstances like it as long as I have been a member of this Association\". He promised life bans for those who assaulted the referee.\n\nCroke Park's stadium director Peter McKenna questioned why Louth manager Peter Fitzpatrick had walked onto the pitch to ask the referee about the decision. Gaelic Players Association (GPA) chief executive Dessie Farrell said: \"What went on last Sunday was a PR disaster for us all\". The National Referees Committee gave a negative response to the idea of goal-line technology being used in future. Retired referee John Bannon said \"No one deserves to be attacked, either verbally or physically, especially in Croke Park. [...] This attitude still remains part of the GAA's culture, it has never been rooted out\". Tyrone County Board (from where the referee originated) sympathised with the Sludden but said the crowd's reaction was \"unbelievable\". Liam O'Neill, a candidate for the GAA presidency in 2012, later said: \"Quite simply, there should have been a re-fixture for that game. Everyone knows that. Everyone knows a wrong was perpetrated\".\n\nThere was significant public and analytical support for Louth and condemnation of the refereeing decision.\n\nOn \"The Sunday Game\" TV highlights programme, Pat Spillane called both the fans and the referee \"disgraceful\", commenting: \n\nFormer Meath player Trevor Giles said: \"If this victory stands, it won't do Meath any favours because there will always be a question mark over the result\". Former Kerry footballer Darragh Ó Sé described the idea of Meath County Board having the final decision on a replay as \"a complete and utter cop-out\". Former Kerry footballer and manager Páidí Ó Sé said: \"there is no way any referee should have allowed Sheridan's goal to stand\". Sligo footballer Eamonn O'Hara suggested that the events gave \"the perfect opportunity [for the GAA] to revamp the way match-day officials are selected\".\n\nVeteran commentator Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh told Ryan Tubridy on his radio show that \"Croke Park abdicated responsibility. They should have taken the matter from Meath\".\n\nMinister for Justice and Law Reform Dermot Ahern, himself from Louth, made known his condemnation of the violence. He attended the match. Taoiseach Brian Cowen also made known his disapproval later from New York: \"I didn't see what happened as the ref was leaving the pitch. But obviously none of that is justified. It was an exciting match obviously. But it doesn't justify anyone engaging in that sort of activity. So I wouldn't like to see it repeated anywhere\". Cowen was also at the match.\n\nThe Garda Síochána announced that it would investigate those persons they said breached the Non-fatal Offences Against the Person Act by battering the referee and others.\n\nBookmaker Boylesports paid all losing bets on the match.\n\nOn 13 July, Louth's county executive committee issued a statement condemning what it described as \"the unsavoury incidents after the match\". Meath's county board gathered in Navan but did not issue an immediate statement, instead requesting more time to think. They later decided that there would be no replay, this would be \"the end of the matter\". Meath were officially champions of Leinster for 2010, though Meath secretary Cyril Creavin conceded that it was a \"tainted\" title and that \"Some of the players are devastated with the reaction in newspapers\". Louth accepted this: their official statement referred to the July 2010 R238 traffic collision which occurred on the same day as the final, sympathising with relatives of the eight people killed, and opting to avoid legal action in such a context. Therefore, Meath automatically entered the quarter-finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, with Louth left to qualify for that same stage by playing (and winning) a further game in Round 4 of the All-Ireland qualifiers.\n\nLouth were drawn against Dublin in their next game. The appointment of experienced referee Pat McEnaney was scrutinised and praised in advance. In the game, held once again at Croke Park on 24 July, Louth were defeated by 2–14 to 0–13, thus being eliminated from the 2010 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. By defeating Louth, Dublin joined Meath in the quarter-finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. For Louth so ended \"the longest summer the county has witnessed in over half a century\".\n\nOn 15 September 2014, \"A Wee Royal Rumble - The Story of the 2010 Leinster Football Final\" was broadcast on RTÉ One as part of \"Scannal\", the TV series dedicated to scandalous events.\n\n\n"}

The 34,200 seater was the home stadium of the Iraq national football team from its opening on 6 November 1966 until the Basra International Stadium was opened in 2013. The stadium is owned by the government of Iraq.\n\nAl-Shaab stadium hosted the 5th Arabian Gulf Cup, the Arab Club Champions Cup in 1982 and 1985, the 1972 Palestine Cup of Nations and the World Military Cup on two occasions: in 1968 and 1972.\n\nAl-Shaab stadium was the largest stadium in Iraq until the Basra International Stadium, that has the capacity of 65,000 spectators, was opened in 2013.\n\nIn late 1959, a delegation from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation visited Former Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim in his office, which was in the Ministry of Defense. The meeting contained an offer that the foundation presented to the government of Iraq. It was assigning a percentage of the steady grant of oil that is owned by the foundation to build projects in Baghdad. These projects included the Iraqi National Museum, the Iraqi National Theater, the Medical City and Al-Shaab Stadium.\n\nAbd al-Karim Qasim announced the building of Al-Shaab stadium on 21 April 1960, in front of 15,000 spectators. He said that the building of the new official stadium of the Iraq national football team will end in 1962 and will have the capacity of 50,000 spectators.\n\nThe cost of construction was 1 million dinars, for the stadium to be one of the biggest in the middle east. Its total area is 200,000m² with the capacity of 34,200 spectators. It had an athletics track covered with Tartan, lighting towers with the height of 55 meters and the total area of the park is 40,000m² with the capacity of 4,000 cars. The complex had two training stadiums, basketball, volleyball, handball and tennis fields and also it contained an Olympic swimming pool.\n\nThe opening match of Al-Shaab stadium was between the Portuguese team, S.L. Benfica., and a team that composed of the best players in Baghdad. 60,000 spectators attended the match in Al-Shaab Stadium that could only hold the maximum capacity of 50,000. 30 minutes into the game, José Augusto Torres scored for Benfica. In the second half, Qasim Mahmoud scored for the Baghdad team at the 55th minute, tying up the game. Benfica made it 2–1 at the 80th minute from a shot by Domiciano Cavém.\nOn 9 April 2003, Al-Shaab stadium was largely damaged after it got bombed by the U.S. Air Force during the Battle of Baghdad (2003). Most of its seats were destroyed and many large holes were made inside the pitch. Until 2004, the stadium was used as an airstrip for the U.S. Air Force. Therefor, in April 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority Chief Administrator, Paul Bremer, announced that $3 million would be given to renovate Al-Shaab Stadium and to make it in a good condition for hosting different sports. The stadium was officially reopened after 2003, on 12 June 2005, being ready to host some of the 2005-06 Iraqi Premier League matches.\n\nIraq national football team couldn't play in Al-Shaab stadium from 2005 to 2009 because of the Iraqi Civil War. Iraq's first match in the stadium, after six years of playing the home matches in other countries, was on 13 July 2009, where Iraq met Palestine in an International friendly and won 4-0.\n\nCompanies started the renovation of Al-Shaab stadium on 2 March 2010 with a cost of $3,966,000 from the expense of the Prime Minister of Iraqi Kurdistan Nechervan Barzani. The renovation included replacing the grass with an evergreen grass, the athletics track with a new one that consists of the blue and white colors and also replacing the seats with yellow, green, blue and grey colored new ones. The renovation was made by English, Swedish and Russian companies. It was finished on 9 May 2010.\n\nIn May 2015, companies cooperated with the Ministry of Youth in renovating the stadium and making it in a good form before a delegation from FIFA visits Iraq to rate Al-Shaab stadium and the Basra International Stadium to start lifting the ban from Iraqi stadiums. The renovation included painting the main compartment, putting ceramic floors, reestablish the electric system of the stadium, re-qualifying the park and the outside area of the stadium, putting electric doors and fixing the elevators to the compartments.\n\nOn 5 August 2015, the administrative company that is responsible of renovating Al-Shaab stadium announced that on 15 August, the renovation continued after it was paused from June to August; because of the Iraqi Premier League. They included replacing the sprinkling system and replacing the pitch, depending on the basis of high-quality international stadiums.\n\nAl-Shaab stadium hosted the World Military Cup of 1968 and 1972, where the Iraq military national football team didn't pass the qualification round in 1968, but in 1972, Iraq became champions after finishing in the top of the league at 6 points, above Italy.\n\nAl-Shaab stadium hosted the 1972 Palestine Cup of Nations, where Iraq were the runners-up of Egypt after finishing in top of Group A in the groups stage at 5 points. Iraq won over Algeria in the semi-final 3-1 by the goals of Shamil Kamil (2 goals) and Ali Kadhim for Iraq and Mustafa Dahleb for Algeria. In the final, Iraq lost 1-3 against Egypt by the goals of Douglas Aziz for Iraq and Hassan El-Shazly and Abdul-Aziz Abdul-Shafi (2 goals) for Egypt.\n\nAl-Shaab stadium hosted the 5th Arabian Gulf Cup, where it was one of the best hosts in the history of the Arabian Gulf Cup. The past Iraqi President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr was represented by Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri in the opening ceremony on 23 March 1979. The opening ceremony was organized and well planned. The first match, after the opening ceremony, was between the hosts, Iraq and Bahrain that ended in a 4-0 win for Iraq. This tournament ended with the hosts as the champions, breaking the streak of Kuwait in winning the Gulf Cup for 4 consecutive tournaments, from 1972 to 1979.\n\nAl-Shaab stadium hosted both legs of the final of the first ever Arab Club Champions Cup in 1982, where Iraqi club Al Shorta SC were the champions after beating Lebanese club Nejmeh SC in the first leg of the final 2–0 and drew with them in the second leg 2–2. Al Shorta were awarded in the stadium, being one of the two Iraqi teams who ever won the Arab Club Champions Cup competition. The other team was Al-Rasheed.\n\nAl-Shaab hosted the third tournament of the Arab Club Champions Cup in 1985, where Al-Rasheed became the champions, after they ended in top of the league in the final stage at 4 points. They beat Nejmeh SC, on 5 December 1985, with a big 6-1 win. On 9 December, they beat Algerian club USM El Harrach with a 2-1 result. Al-Rasheed also won 1986 Arab Club Champions Cup and the 1987 one.\n\nAl-Shaab stadium hosted the matches of Group 1 for the 1980 Asian Olympic Qualifying Tournaments, where Round 1 ended with Iraq in the top of the league and Kuwait in 2nd place. In the playoff match between Iraq and Kuwait, 65,000 spectators arrived at the stadium. Iraq ended the first half with the score being 2-0. The goals were scored by Nizar Ashraf at the 6th and 44th minutes. In the second half, the Kuwaitis had an uprising, scoring three goals in 13 minutes. The goals were from Jasem Yaqoub at the 69th minute, Nassir Al-Ghanim at the 79th minute and Yaqoub again in the 82nd minute, qualifying Kuwait into the 1980 Summer Olympics. However, Iraq still qualified to the Olympics after Malaysia withdrew.\n\nAfter FIFA lifted the ban from Iraqi soil, because of the Iraq-Iran war, the Iraqi Football Association sent an invitation to the Dansk Boldspil-Union for a friendly in Baghdad and in Al-Shaab stadium. The DBU sent the Denmark League XI national football team to play against Iraq in two matches regarded by FIFA and IFA as A internationals, but it wasn't regarded as such by the DBU. The first match was on 1 February, where the Danish team was on top of its game, unlike the Iraqi team, which had lots of gaps and mistakes, resulting in an early goal in the 6th minute from Claus Nielsen and another one in the 33rd minute from Jan Bartram. In the second match, Iraq dominated the whole match, scoring a goal from Hussein Saeed just before halftime from a penalty and another one from Natiq Hashim Abidoun in the 63rd minute.\n\nAl-Shaab stadium hosted the home match of Iraq against Qatar in the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC), where Iraq needed to win because they were only one point away from first placed Qatar. Iraq and Qatar started the match with rain showering on its ground. In the first half, Iraq were the better side, but because of the slippery ground, the Iraqi defense made some mistakes resulting in a goal for Qatar from Saleh Eid al-Mehaizaa in the 18th minute. Ahmed Radhi equalized the score from a header in the 31st minute. In the second half, Iraq controlled the match completely with Qatar wasting time in hope for a draw. But, from counter-attack led by Radhi and Hussein Saeed, Saeed scored his last goal with Iraq, being the most goals scorer for Iraq at 78 goals. In the 85th minute, Qatar equalized the score, after the Iraqi audience at Al-Shaab Stadium were sure of their national team claiming the win, by Adel Khamis. The match ended in a 2-2 draw, which qualified Qatar to the next round of the qualifications. After this match, the Iraqi golden team of the 80s ended with the retiring of Khalil Allawi, Ali Hussein Shihab, Basil Gorgis, Ghanim Oraibi, Ahmad Jassim and Hussein Saeed.\n\n"}

{"id": "13012048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13012048", "title": "Captain (baseball)", "text": "Captain (baseball)\n\nIn baseball, a captain is an honorary title sometimes given to a member of the team to acknowledge his leadership. In the early days of baseball, a captain was a player who was responsible for many of the functions now assumed by managers and coaches, such as preparing lineups, making decisions about strategy, and encouraging teamwork. In amateur or youth baseball, a manager or coach may appoint a team captain to assist in communicating with the players and to encourage teamwork and improvement.\n\nMajor League Baseball's official rules only briefly mention the position of team captain. Official Baseball Rule 4.03 Comment (formerly Rule 4.01 Comment) which discusses the submission of a team's lineup to the umpire, notes that obvious errors in the lineup should be brought to the attention of the team's manager or captain.\n\nIn Major League Baseball, only a handful of teams have designated a player as captain in recent years, and there are no current team captains. Jerry Remy, who was named as captain of the California Angels in 1977 at age 24, explains that in today's modern age of baseball, \"there's probably no need for a captain on a major league team. I think there are guys who lead by example. You could name the best player on your team as captain, but he may not be the guy other players will talk to or who will quietly go to other players and give them a prod.\" They do not wear an NHL-style \"C\" on their jersey. Retired first baseman Mike Sweeney, former captain of the Kansas City Royals from 2003 to 2007, wore the \"C\" patch, as did two other recently retired captains: John Franco of the Mets, and Jason Varitek of the Boston Red Sox.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, the captain held most of the on-field responsibilities that are held by managers and coaches in modern baseball. For example, according to the 1898 official rules, the captain was responsible for assigning the players' positions and batting order, for appealing to the umpire if he observed certain violations (for example, if the other team intentionally discolored the ball or its players illegally left the bench), and for informing the umpire of any special ground rules. During a period when teams didn't carry full-time coaches, the captain and one or more other players could serve as \"coachers\" of the base runners; the lines setting off the section where they were allowed to stand were designated as \"captain's lines.\" If the umpire made a decision that could \"be plainly shown by the code of rules to have been illegal\", the \"captain alone shall be allowed to make the appeal for reversal.\" The rules state that the captain must be one of the nine players, implying that a non-playing manager would not have been allowed to act in the captain's role. In contrast with modern baseball, the 1898 rules do not mention the managers having any rights to interact with the umpires. The rules allowed managers to sit on the team's bench during the game, but were otherwise silent with respect to rights and responsibilities of managers.\n\nIn early baseball, many teams had playing managers who had both the off-field responsibilities of managers and the on-field responsibilities of captains. They held the title of \"manager-captain.\" In contrast, teams that had non-playing managers hired a player to serve as captain. For example, in early 1902 Jack Doyle was signed as captain and first baseman of the New York Giants while non-player Horace Fogel was manager.\n\nThough the role of a captain has been significant in the histories of teams such as the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, and the San Francisco Giants, other teams, such as the Milwaukee Brewers, have, as of 2016, never had a captain.\n\n\n"}

Lee Carroll made a donation for the field to be constructed, and his father and grandfather had also donated to build the Carroll Science Building and Carroll Library. From 1926 to 1929, Baylor football games were played at the Cotton Palace in Waco. During Baylor's first season, they were beat 33-0 by Texas A&M, but the Waco Times-Herald attempted to make the loss positive, saying, \"For an eleven many of whose players did not know the shape of the oval until this season, Baylor put up a fair exhibition.” \n\nDuring Thanksgiving Day 1909, Carroll Field was the location of Baylor's first Homecoming football game; the 5,000 attendees to the football game paid US$1 each and, at the time, the crowd was known as the largest ever. In the football game, Baylor defeated Texas Christian University, who had shut out Baylor in their last two games, 6–3. \n\nIn 1940, groundbreaking began for Baylor University's Student Union Building on the location of Carroll Field, but since 1935, the new Waco Stadium had hosted Baylor football games.

{"id": "11150394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11150394", "title": "Closed Game", "text": "Closed Game\n\nA Closed Game (or Double Queen's Pawn Opening) is a chess opening that begins with the moves:\nThe move 1.d4 offers the same benefits to development and center control as does 1.e4, but unlike with the King Pawn openings where the e4 pawn is undefended after the first move, the d4 pawn is protected by White's queen. This slight difference has a tremendous effect on the opening. For instance, whereas the King's Gambit is rarely played today at the highest levels of chess, the Queen's Gambit remains popular at all levels of play. Also, compared with the King Pawn openings, transpositions between variations are more common and important in the closed games.\n\nThe Richter-Veresov Attack, Colle System, Stonewall Attack, Torre Attack, London System, and Blackmar-Diemer Gambit are classified as Queen's Pawn Games because White plays d4 but not c4. The Richter-Veresov is rarely played at the top levels of chess. The Colle and Stonewall are both \"Systems\", rather than specific opening variations.\nWhite develops aiming for a particular formation without great concern over how Black chooses to defend.\nBoth these systems are popular with club players because they are easy to learn,\nbut are rarely used by professionals because a well prepared opponent playing Black can equalize fairly easily.\nThe Blackmar-Diemer Gambit is an attempt by White to open lines and obtain attacking chances.\nMost professionals consider it too risky for serious games, but it is popular with amateurs and in blitz chess.\nThe most important closed openings are in the Queen's Gambit family (White plays 2.c4).\nThe Queen's Gambit is somewhat misnamed, since White can always regain the offered pawn if desired.\nIn the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Black plays ...dxc4, giving up the center for free development and the chance to try to give White an isolated queen pawn with a subsequent ...c5 and ...cxd4.\nWhite will get active pieces and possibilities for the attack.\nBlack has two popular ways to decline the pawn, the Slav (2...c6) and the Queen's Gambit Declined (2...e6).\nBoth of these moves lead to an immense forest of variations that can require a great deal of opening study to play well.\nAmong the many possibilities in the Queen's Gambit Declined are the Orthodox Defense, Lasker Defense, the Cambridge Springs Defense, the Tartakower Variation, and the Tarrasch and Semi-Tarrasch Defenses.\nBlack replies to the Queen's Gambit other than 2...dxc4, 2...c6, and 2...e6 are uncommon.\nThe Chigorin Defense (2...Nc6) is playable but rare.\nThe Symmetrical Defense (2...c5) is the most direct challenge to Queen's Gambit theory —\nCan Black equalize by simply copying White's moves?\nMost opening theoreticians believe not, and consequently the Symmetrical Defense is not popular.\nThe Baltic Defense (2...Bf5) takes the most direct solution to solving the problem of Black's queen bishop by developing it on the second move.\nAlthough it is not trusted by most elite players, it has not been refuted and some very strong grandmasters have played it.\nThe Albin Countergambit (2...e5) is generally considered too risky for top-level tournament play. Similarly, the Marshall Defense (2...Nf6) is very rarely seen in grandmaster play, as most theoreticians consider it definitely inferior for Black.\n\n\n"}

Originally there were twenty members. The golf course, which opened in 1911, was designed by Herbert Barker. The first location of the Club was on the east side of Brightwood Avenue, afterwards known as Georgia Avenue, in the neighborhood of Schuetzen Park. It stands as one of the oldest and most prestigious country clubs in the United States. Through its history, the club has counted among its members two Five Star Generals, Omar Bradley and Hap Arnold, along with countless politicians, most notably Barack Obama, journalists, CEOs and lobbyists.\n\nThe present site on Connecticut Avenue was purchased in 1909 from the Chevy Chase Land Company. The certificate of incorporation is dated August 25, 1909. The design of Frederick B. Pyle for the club house was selected from among four submitted. The golf course, completed in 1911, was designed by Herbert Barker, a noted golfer and course architect of the day. Walter Travis made extensive renovations to the course in 1915. Although there is no newspaper record of the event, the opening of the new Club occurred on January 6, 1911. Early Club minutes were lost. The course was one of the favorite courses of President Woodrow Wilson.\n\nThe U.S. Open was held at the Club in 1921, won by Englishman, Jim Barnes. President Warren Harding presented the Champion's Trophy. With the exception of the eighth hole, there have been changes (for the better) on all holes of the course. Several acres were added to the original in the 1930s. Other improvements, such as new tee boxes and a better irrigation system, were added in the early part of 2012.\n\nThe first swimming pool (donated by Donald Woodward) opened in 1925. The Olympic-sized pool was built much later and the entire area was totally renovated in 1978. A profusion of tennis courts have existed from the beginning of the Club. Platform tennis courts were added in the 1960s. Major changes have been made on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes of the golf course, made possible by the construction of a water line through the area by the WSSC under its power of eminent domain. In addition, 2009 saw the completion of a major renovation and addition of the club house, adding an indoor swimming facility, upgraded fitness center, new bowling alley (duckpin), locker rooms, ice skating rink (winter only) and additional parking among other things. Throughout its rich history, only three head golf professionals ever worked at the club, Fred McLeod, William Strasbaugh, and Robert Dolan (its current head PGA Professional).\n\nColumbia has a history of counting some of the best amateur golfers in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area among its membership. Martin R. West III, a multiple club champion at Columbia, made the cut in 1973 the Masters Tournament and 1976 U.S. Open; he has competed in 19 United States Amateurs, is a former US Walker Cup team member, and has won numerous area tournaments including nine Maryland Amateurs. The annual club championship, contested in early September, is one of the most prestigious in the DC area. Columbia's MSGA A team has been very successful, winning the competition multiple times (most recently 2017).\n\nChristine Blasey Ford testified to the US Senate on September 27, 2018, that she was likely at the club prior to attending the social gathering at which she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Judge Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe Columbia course favors shotmaking and finesse over the ability to drive the ball long distances. The natural topography of the area means that Columbia's course is very hilly, with tight fairways and small, undulating greens that are almost universally sloped back to front. Course superintendents generally keep the Columbia greens at a very high speed, and rarely do they roll anything less than an 11 on the Stimp meter.\n\nA common saying among members and caddies is that \"there are only two flat lies at Columbia, on the tee and in your pocket\". Because of the layout, driving the ball long distances can often get a player into trouble due to deep rough, side-hill lies, pot bunkers, and the aforementioned tight fairways. Almost every approach shot on the golf course plays significantly either uphill or downhill, including severe downhill plays on #2, #5, #12, #14, #15, and #16. Hole #17 at Columbia is a truly unique hole, with only a 200-yard tee shot required to a short but wide section of fairway. From there, the player must chip straight uphill only 70 yards to a green sloped from front to back.\n\nThe signature hole, however, remains the par 3 16th, which, legend has it, served as Bobby Jones's inspiration for the 12th hole at Augusta National Golf Club. From one of three tee boxes, the hole plays to a very long, narrow green with three distinct levels that is guarded completely along the front by a large pond. Complicating matters are two pot bunkers, one in front of the green and one behind. The hole has been consistently rated among the best in the area, and was ranked by \"Washingtonian\" magazine locally.\n\nOverall, the par 70 (35-35) course measures in length, with a course rating of 72.3 and slope rating of 139. \n\n"}

The stadium was previously called the KC Stadium, but was renamed as part of a major rebrand by the stadium's sponsors, telecommunications provider KCOM, on 4 April 2016. Conceived in the late 1990s, it was completed in 2002 at a cost of approximately £44 million. The stadium is owned by Hull City Council and operated by the Stadium Management Company (SMC), who are looking to expand the stadium up to 32,000.\n\nThe bowl-shaped stadium contains a continuous single tier of seats with a second tier on the west side. Its current capacity is 25,400. The stadium hosts two tenants, association football club Hull City A.F.C., which moved there from Boothferry Park, and rugby league football club Hull F.C., relocated from the Boulevard. It is also the 2nd largest rugby league stadium in England. The ground also hosts international association football and rugby league football competitions and acts as a venue for concerts by musical artists, such as Elton John and The Who.\n\nThe idea of a new stadium for Kingston upon Hull, whose professional football club Hull City had played at Boothferry Park since 1946, was first mooted in 1997, but funds to finance such a project only became available when the city council sold a portion of its holdings in Kingston Communications. The council provided most of the funds, more than £42 million, with the rest stemming from government single regeneration budget grants and from the Football Stadium Improvement Fund.\n\nThe council appointed John Topliss to head the stadium construction project. He and his team partnered with consulting firm Drivers Jonas to explore preliminary issues such as stadium location, seating capacity, and facilities offered. Stated Mr. Topliss: \"We had a totally blank canvas and, working with consultants, made a thorough assessment of what was needed.\"\n\nThe project team considered over a dozen sites, inside and outside of the city, before settling on The Circle in West Park. Factors contributing to the decision include transport guidance, central government planning guidelines, existing athletic facilities, isolation from residential areas, and council ownership.\nThe final recommendation of Drivers Jonas included additional facilities for both indoor and outdoor sports for the people of West Hull in addition to the main stadium, planned to seat from 25,000 to 30,000 spectators. Professional services firm Arup Associates provided initial concept proposals for the stadium. The Miller Partnership, an architectural and interior design firm, adopted these proposals during the stadium's design.\n\nIn spite of obstacles during the course of the project, including Hull City A.F.C.'s receivership in 2001 (just after the granting of planning permission), the stadium complex was completed on time (in fourteen months) and on budget (at approximately GB£44 million). The stadium opened its doors on 18 December 2002. Hull City beat Sunderland A.F.C. 1–0 in a friendly match to mark the occasion. Steve Melton scored the goal, the first at the KC Stadium.\n\nThe all-seater stadium consists of a single-tier, asymmetrical bowl that can seat approximately 20,000, with a second tier on the Cranswick plc West Stand that can seat approximately 5,000. Current capacity is 25,586. Plans provide for future expansion to a capacity of approximately 30,000 by the addition of a second tier on the Ideal Standard Community East Stand. Each stand has a name for corporate sponsorship purposes. On 4 July 2011, Hull City revealed that the stadium's west stand would be sponsored by the local Cranswick plc under a two-year agreement, which was extended on 26 July 2013.\nOn 10 July 2013 it was announced the east stand would be sponsored by Ideal Standard and become known as the Ideal Standard Community East Stand.\n\nCorporate hospitality is provided by 28 executive boxes located between the two tiers of the Cranswick plc West Stand, while security of the stadium is handled using 57 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras that cover the stadium. Over the summer of 2007, SMC installed an LED screen in the Smith & Nephew North Stand to replace the old electronic scoreboard. The screen has an area of approximately 40 m² (430 ft.²) and displays such content as live home game feeds, match highlights, interviews, and action replays.\nThe stadium's seats are mostly black, with a band of white and amber seats around the circumference. White and amber seats form the word \"Hull\" in the north and south stands. In the Ideal Standard Community East Stand, the seats form an image of a coronet, a symbol of the city that also appears in the club crest for Hull F.C. and in the coat of arms of the city council. Black, white, and amber were chosen to remain neutral toward the colours of its two tenants: black and white for Hull F.C.and black and amber for Hull City A.F.C.. The blue and gold of owner Hull City Council appear in the stadium's four external columns.\n\nThe size of the playing surface is 114 x 74 metres (125 x 81 yd) and made of rye grass with a 3% additive of artificial grass. This provides ample room for a FIFA-regulation association football pitch of 105 x 68 metres (115 x 74 yd) and a standard rugby league football pitch of 100 x 68 metres (109 x 74 yd). The playing surface has an automated watering system and below-surface heating.\n\nSet within Hull's West Park, the stadium is the first in England to be built in a parkland setting. The stadium complex also includes the 1,500 seat Bonus Arena, a skate park, two multi-use all-weather pitches, a community learning zone complete with classrooms, a health & fitness suite, a cyber cafe, and a library.\n\nThe KCOM Stadium has received several honours. It was named the chief new development in Yorkshire at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Pro-Yorkshire Awards. It was also on the shortlist for the Prime Minister's Award for Better Public Building and received a high commendation in the British Construction Industry Awards in the Best Value category. In a 2005 poll that was carried out by Drivers Jonas and decided by football fans from across the country, the KC Stadium was rated highest in comfort, services and view among all grounds in the Football League and was also rated the most-improved venue.\n\nOn 13 August 2013 a Goal Decision System by Hawk-Eye was installed in the ground ahead of the 2013–14 Premier League season which requires the use of goal-line technology to indicate if a goal is scored.\n\nThe stadium replaced Boothferry Park as home to Hull City Association Football Club, and was the backdrop for the club's recent climb through the English Football League. It first hosted the club's home games during the second half of the 2002–03 season; the first competitive match was against Hartlepool United, a game that Hull City won by a score of 2–0. Hull City, nicknamed \"the Tigers\", attracted an average attendance of almost 17,000 in their first full season at the KC Stadium, 2003–04. This figure is more than three times the average Third Division attendance for that season, and was only matched or exceeded by clubs in the Premier League and the First Division. However, the level of support was not matched by on-field performances; the Tigers finished 13th in their first season at the KC Stadium. However, in 2003–04 (their first full season at the new ground), Hull won promotion as Third Division runners-up, securing their place in the newly named League One (previously the Second Division). A second successive promotion to the Championship, again as runners-up, followed in 2004–05.\n\nAttendances for Hull City's league games at the KCOM Stadium have averaged above 16,000 in each full season they have played there, apart from the 2017–18 season. The stadium hosted Premier League football in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons, with all 20,500 available season tickets selling out shortly after Hull City's Championship play-off victory at Wembley Stadium. The record attendance for a Premier League match is 25,030 set on 9 May 2010 for the last match of the season against Liverpool\nbeating the previous record of 25,023 set on 13 March 2010 against Arsenal. While playing in the Championship, the record stood at 24,350 on 26 April 2008 for the visit of Crystal Palace, beating that of 24,311 on 30 January 2007 for the visit of local rivals Leeds United. Segregation between home fans and away fans prevents the stadium's stated capacity from being reached.\n\nPlans have been prepared for the potential extension of the stadium following Hull City's promotion to the Premier League. 4,500 seats could be added in a second tier to the east stand, and 2,000 seats each in the north and south stands, giving the stadium a capacity of approximately 34,000. In 2011, the club's owner Assem Allam announced that he wanted to buy the stadium freehold so he could develop, as he stated, \"a sports park\" on the site.\nAfter Hull City Council refused, Allam stated \"I had in mind £30 million to spend on the infrastructure of the club, to increase the stadium by 10,000 and to have commercial activities around the stadium – cafeterias, shops, supermarkets – to have all this to create income for the club so that in the future it can be self-financing and not relying on me.\"\n\nOn 9 August 2013, Allam announced that the club will discard its 109-year-old name and, henceforth, be \"marketed\" as Hull City Tigers locally and Hull Tigers to national and international audiences. Announcing the change in the \"Hull Daily Mail\" newspaper, he said: \"'Hull City' is irrelevant...it is common. I want the club to be special. It is about identity. 'City' is a lousy identity. 'Hull City Association Football Club' is so long.\" The club's Managing Director Nick Thompson urged supporters \"to judge it in the fullness of time.\" The announcement stated that all references to \"AFC\" on club branding will be phased out, although they will remain on the shirt crest during their first season back in the Premier League.\n\nAllam justified the name change as part of his plans to create \"additional sources of revenue\" for the club. He dismissed fans' protests against the name change, stating \"nobody questions my decisions in my business.\"\n\nProfessional rugby league's Hull Football Club play their home games at the KCOM Stadium, having moved from the Boulevard. During their time at the KCOM Stadium, they have consistently ended each season on a high note: in 2003, the team just missed play-off qualification; in 2004, the club finished third. They finished fourth in 2005, and enjoyed even greater success in the Challenge Cup, in which they beat the Leeds Rhinos in the final. Hull F.C. reached the Super League Grand Final in 2006. Attendances average around 14,000, but are often well above that figure when the club hosts local rivals Hull Kingston Rovers, this local derby producing a record crowd of 23,004 for 2 September 2007 fixture.\n\nIt hosted four England under-21 internationals. The results were as follows.\nThe KCOM Stadium is now also a regular venue for international rugby league games, and has hosted Great Britain matches in both the Tri-Nations and the Ashes competitions. The stadium hosted the 2004 Tri-Nations match in which New Zealand lost by a score of 26–24. The stadium also hosted the Tri-Nations game between Great Britain and Australia in 2005; the final score was 26–14 to Australia.\n\nOn Saturday 9 November 2013, the stadium hosted the England versus Fiji Rugby League World Cup match, in which England won 34–12 in front of an attendance of 25,114. Before the match, there was a minute's silence, followed by spontaneous applause, to mark the early death of former England International Steve Prescott.\n\nIn 2009, the KC Stadium was shortlisted as a possible venue for games at the 2018 FIFA World Cup should England win the right to host it, but when the list of venues was announced on 16 December that year, the KC Stadium was not included.\n\nIt has also played host to two exhibition Twenty20 cricket matches between Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Lashings World XI.\n\nAs well as serving as a sporting venue, the KCOM Stadium also hosts musical events, including such artists as Sir Elton John, Bryan Adams, Neil Diamond, R.E.M., Bon Jovi, and The Who.\n\nJLS have also performed here in front of 20,000 fans as part of their 2010 JLS Tour.\n\nRod Stewart performed at the stadium on 14 June 2016 and Jeff Lynne's ELO played at the stadium on 1 July 2017.\n\nList of test, league and International tournament matches played at KCOM Stadium since its opening in 2002.\n"}

{"id": "301001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301001", "title": "Sea kayak", "text": "Sea kayak\n\nA sea kayak or touring kayak is a kayak developed for the sport of paddling on open waters of lakes, bays, and the ocean. Sea kayaks are seaworthy small boats with a covered deck and the ability to incorporate a spray deck. They trade off the maneuverability of whitewater kayaks for higher cruising speed, cargo capacity, ease of straight-line paddling, and comfort for long journeys.\n\nSea kayaks are used around the world for marine (sea) journeys from a few hours to many weeks, as they can accommodate one to three paddlers together with room for camping gear, food, water, and other supplies. A sea kayak usually ranges anywhere from for solo craft, and up to for tandem craft. Width may be as little as , and may be up to .\n\nContemporary sea kayaks trace their origin to the native boats of Alaska, northern Canada, and Southwest Greenland. Eskimo hunters developed a fast seagoing craft to hunt seals and walrus. The ancient Aleut name for a sea kayak is \"Iqyak\", and earliest models were constructed from a light wooden frame (tied together with sinew or baleen) and covered with sea mammal (sea lion or seal) hides. Archaeologists have found evidence indicating that kayaks are at least 4000 years old. Wooden kayaks and fabric kayaks on wooden frames (such as the Klepper) dominated the market up until the 1950s, when fiberglass boats were introduced. Rotomolded plastic kayaks first appeared in 1984.\n\nModern sea kayaks come in a wide array of materials, designs, and sizes to suit a variety of intended uses. In sea kayaking, where the designs continue along primarily traditional lines, the primary distinction is between \"rigid\" kayaks and \"folding\" kayaks. Folding kayaks are in some ways more traditional boats, being similar in design to \"skin-on-frame\" kayaks used by native people. Modern folding kayaks use ash and birch or contemporary materials such as aluminum for the frame, and replace the sealskin covering with synthetic waterproof fabrics. Unlike native kayaks, folding kayaks can be easily disassembled and packed for transport. Many folding kayaks include inflatable sponsons that improve the secondary stability of the vessel, helping to prevent capsize. More recently, a class of inflatable folding kayaks has emerged, combining a more limited rigid frame with a tightly inflated skin to produce greater rigidity than an inflatable boat alone.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in production of sit on top kayaks suitable for sea use. This has resulted in a new market for paddlers looking for the versatility of a sit on top, with seaworthy performance. Sit on top kayaks are a common choice for sea kayakers who prefer the sit on top versatility, but do not want to sacrifice performance.\n\nMost rigid sea kayaks also derive from the external designs of native vessels, especially those from Greenland, but the strength of modern materials such as fiberglass, rotomolded plastic and carbon fiber eliminate the need for an internal frame, though significantly increasing weight. Modern \"skin-on-frame\" sea kayaks constructed with nylon skins represent an ultralight niche within the rigid sea kayak spectrum. Some recent design innovations include:\n\nA different class of vessel emerged in the 1960s, the Surf ski, a long, narrow boat with low inherent stability that is intended for use in surf and following waves.\n\nMost production sea kayaks are between in length, the larger kayaks often built for two (or in rare cases, three) paddlers. The width (beam) of typical kayaks varies from , though specialized boats such as surf skis may be narrower. The length of a kayak affects not only its cargo capacity (for both gear and paddlers) but may also affect its \"tracking\" ability—the ease with which the boat travels in a straight line. While other design features also impact tracking, very long kayaks are easier to paddle straight (and harder to turn). The width of a kayak affects the cargo capacity, the maximum size of the cockpit (and thus the size of the paddler in that cockpit), and (to a degree that depends on the design of the hull) the stability.\n\nMost rigid production kayaks are now made out of fiberglass, rotomolded polyethylene, thermoformed plastic, blow moulded polyethylene or carbon-kevlar. More exotic materials include carbon fiber and foam core. Some kayaks are hand-built from plywood or wood strips covered with fiberglass. Skin-on-frame kayaks are built on wood or aluminum frames covered in canvas, dacron, or other fabrics, and may include inflatable tubes called sponsons.\n\nMarine Grade plywood available today provides a high strength to weight ratio for kayak construction.\n\nThere are many design approaches for the bow, stern, and deck of kayaks. Some kayaks have upturned bows, which are meant to provide better performance when paddling into waves, as well as better wave-shedding ability. Other kayaks achieve this through increased buoyancy in the bow. Kayaks with unobstructed stern decks may ease certain types of self-rescue. Waterproof bulkheads in modern kayaks provide flotation in the event of capsize.\n\nSea kayak decks typically include one or more hatches for easy access to the interior storage space inside. Kayak decks often include attachment points for \"deck lines\" of various kinds, which are aids in self-rescue and attachment points for above-deck equipment.\n\nCockpits can be of several designs. They can be large or small. A large keyhole cockpit can give the advantages of both, and combine firm contact between paddler and boat, while offering relatively easier access.\n\nSea Kayaks have a wide range of hull designs, which greatly expands their range of performance. Designs can accommodate a wide range of physical fitness, or usage. Boats come in many lengths, whereby shorter boats are generally more maneuverable, and longer boats generally travel straighter and faster. Width of beam can affect a boat's stability, speed, and ability to bring to an edge. The amount of rocker (the curve from bow to stern) can greatly affect the ability of a boat to turn.\n\nMany have steering gear or tracking aids in the form of rudders or skegs. In most cases rudders are attached at the stern and operated by lines (wire or synthetics such as Spectra) from foot pedals in the cockpit. Rudders are typically retractable for beach landings. Skegs are typically retractable straight blades that drop from a well in the stern of the boat. Both devices assist in paddling when a strong wind or waves are coming from a direction other than directly in front. Some Skegs may be more effective at countering pitch, roll and yaw.\n\nSea-kayak paddles, and the associated paddling styles, fall into three basic classifications:\n\n\nTrue Sea kayaks, not to be mistaken for wider, more stable recreational kayaks, come in many designs. The length of a solo sea kayak can range anywhere from long, and tandem kayaks can range from long. Sea kayaks can range in width from (). Wider touring kayaks of () are better for bigger paddlers, or small/average sized paddlers looking for more initial stability and maneuverability. Narrower beams of () are good for small-medium-sized paddlers who want more speed and less maneuverability. And lastly, kayak depth (or the height from the hull to the highest area of the deck) can range from () high.\n\nThis design is typical of modern sea kayaks and has a low rear deck for easy rolling, a white water cockpit, compartments that allow the kayaker to reach into them while at sea, and a sloping rear bulkhead that enables the kayak to be emptied by lifting the bow.\n\nA sea kayak's primary safety device is its paddler. Although some kayakers consider a well-practised self-righting move such as an Eskimo roll to be essential in order to safe open-water kayaking, it is the technique of bracing that every well-trained, experienced kayaker practises in order to maintain an upright position in their kayak. Practice in bracing is often neglected by inexperienced kayakers once they have learned the Eskimo roll. However, the reality is that having to roll really means having to recover from a failed brace. Being in the capsized position in some environments due to missing a brace can put the paddler in danger of colliding with obstacles under the water. Staying upright in surf zones, rocky surf zones (informally known as rock gardens), and rivers is most important and is only accomplished through well-practised and successful bracing.\n\nWhile there are a number of techniques for unassisted righting and re-entry of a kayak after a capsize and turtling, most paddlers consider it safest to paddle with one or more others, as assistance is useful if attempting to recover via rolling solo fails. Even if the assistance fails to successfully right the kayaker, it is much easier to climb back into a boat in the open sea if one has another boat and paddler to help and the swamped boat has been emptied of water first. Nonetheless, experienced paddlers do attempt open-water crossings unaccompanied, and many major long-distance kayak expeditions have been carried out solo.\n\nThe use of a Paddle float self-rescue device, generally consisting of foam or in the form of an inflatable bag, and attached to the end of a paddle when needed, allows the paddle to be used as an outrigger while climbing back into the cockpit. If an inflatable paddle float is chosen, it should be a dual-chambered model on account of the safety advantage (in the event of failure of one chamber) that is conferred by the redundancy. The kayaker is advised to train with only one chamber inflated. In many areas (Canada, for instance), a paddle float is a safety item required by the coast guard. Re-entry using a paddle float is a fairly reliable rescue technique that, if well practised, allows one to paddle with confidence when one is not equipped with a flawlessly honed rolling skill.\n\nThere is a strong culture of self-sufficiency amongst sea kayakers and extensive safety equipment such as compass, towing lines, manual pumps, repair kits including wet application repair tape, flares, paddle leash, spare paddles, and survival gear are routinely carried; along with supplies of food and a flask of hot beverage for non-emergency use. GPS, charts, lights, radios and cell phones, and radar reflectors are also sometimes carried.\n\nDeveloped by kayak enthusiasts, Kayak sails can supplement or effectively eliminate the need for paddling. Using a sail can increase offshore range and allow longer expeditions. Use of a sail for touring has established a strong following with recreational sea kayakers, expedition paddlers, and adventure racers.\n\nWeekend trips with overnight camping are popular among recreational kayakers and many combine kayaking with wildlife watching. Modern sea kayaks are designed to carry large amounts of equipment and unsupported expeditions of two weeks or more are conducted in environments ranging from the tropics to the Arctic. Expedition kayaks are designed to handle best when loaded, so it may be necessary to ballast them on shorter trips.\n\nClosely related to surf boards and requiring a mix of surfing and kayaking skills, a wide range of sea kayaks are specifically designed for the sport of wave surfing.\n\nThe sea kayak has long been a means of transportation and a means of accessing fishing grounds and kayak fishing has gained popularity due to the availability of purpose built stable designs. This technological development also solves some ergonomic problems that are associated with sitting for long hours without being able to change positions and special kayaks for fishing are accessorized for this sport, including specially-designed hatches, built-in rod holders, catch bags and equipment mounts.\n\nMany of the techniques used in kayak fishing are the same as those used on other fishing boats. The difference is in the set-up, how each piece of equipment is fitted to the kayak, and how each activity is carried out on such a small craft. Contemporary kayaks can be equipped with fishing aids such as rod holders, electronic fish-finders and live-bait containers. Kayak anglers target highly prized bottom feeders like halibut and cod and also pelagics like amberjacks, tuna, sailfish, wahoo, and even marlin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine \"Muscle & Fitness\". Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present \"Shape\", Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy. MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided. Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1988. Tara Kraft is the current editor-in-chief. \"Shape\" found a readership based on that formula.\n\nWeider was purchased by American Media in 2002. A German version of \"Shape\" is available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The magazine is also edited in Romania.\n\nOn January 28, 2015, it was reported that \"Shape\" would be acquired by Meredith Corp. and \"Fitness\", published by the company, would cease publication in May 2015 and be combined with it.\n\nSections in the magazine include Features & Cover Stories, Shape Your Life, Look Great, Live Healthy, Get Fit, Eat Right, You In Shape, and In Every Issue, which includes From the Editor’s Desk, Contributors, Readers Speak Out, The Hot List and Fit & Famous.\n\nOther topics include sex, mind/spirit, beauty, travel, fashion, work, home and style.\n\n"}

It is similar to boules and horseshoes but is played with a flat and heavy object called a \"varpa\" instead of balls. Varpas used to be well-shaped stones, but nowadays, aluminium is more popular. A varpa can weigh between a half kilo and five kilos. The object of the game is to throw the varpa as close to a stick as possible. The stick is 15 meters away for women and 20 meters away for men. The game can be played individually or in teams.\n\nNo official nationally sponsored varpa teams exist; however, unofficial leagues are growing in popularity among youth in suburban areas of Sweden and Norway.\n\n\"Varpa\" is an old word which simply means \"to throw\".\n\nVarpa is one of the disciplines at the annual Stånga Games (\"Stångaspelen\").\n\n"}

In addition to the original \"Wii Fit\" activities and options, \"Wii Fit Plus\" incorporates 15 new balance and aerobics games (referred to as \"Training Plus\") and six new strength training and yoga activities. New features include a calorie burning counter, the ability for users to create custom fitness regimens or choose from a number of specialized routines based on specific objectives and available time, as well as having the option to create profiles for pets and babies. Users are also able to navigate more quickly between exercises.\n\n\"Wii Fit Plus\" is sold bundled with a Wii Balance Board, as well as separately for existing Wii Balance Board owners. Most activities are for a single player, but there are a number of multi-player activities that allow for up to 8 players to take turns using one Wii Balance Board.\n\n\"Wii Fit Plus\" garnered both critical and commercial success. The game has received aggregate review scores of 80.83% and 80% on GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. \"Wii Fit Plus\" is the seventh best-selling game on the Wii, with a total of 21.13 million copies sold as of September 2018.\n\n\"Wii Fit Plus\" provides all of the original activities in \"Wii Fit\" in addition to fifteen Balance/Aerobics games (in a separate category called \"Training Plus\") and six Yoga and Strength-Training exercises unique to the game.\n\n\nProducer Shigeru Miyamoto was inspired by the commercial success of \"Wii Fit\" to produce a follow-up. Miyamoto learned during \"Wii Fit Plus\" development that many \"Wii Fit\" owners had stopped playing the game, believing the primary reason to be inconvenience. A new menu interface, My Wii Fit Plus, was implemented to address this issue and make accessing activities quicker and easier. The interface was recreated and adjusted multiple times during development. In designing new minigames for \"Wii Fit Plus\", Miyamoto desired to create activities that played upon the Stroop effect, requiring coordination of both the player's mind and body; minigames in which the player uses both the Wii Remote and the Wii Balance Board at the same time became a major focus.\n\n\"Wii Fit Plus\" generally received positive reviews from critics. GameRankings reports an aggregate score of 80.83% based on 18 reviews, and Metacritic reports a score of 80% based on 33 reviews. IGN gave \"Wii Fit Plus\" a score of 8.2. GameSpot gave it a 7.5 out of 10. 1UP gave it an A-, stating, \"There's still some tightening up to be done, but Wii Fit Plus is a definite improvement in the format.\"\n\nWithin one month of its release, \"Wii Fit Plus\" sold 2.16 million copies worldwide, and as of September 2018, the game has sold 21.13 million units worldwide.\n\nIn May 2010 the American Heart Association (AHA) endorsed the Wii to encourage sedentary people to take the first step toward fitness. The AHA heart icon covers the console itself along with two of its more active games, \"Wii Fit Plus\" and \"Wii Sports Resort\".\n\n\n"}
