{"id": "4268876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4268876", "title": "Brisbane Road", "text": "Brisbane Road\n\nBrisbane Road, currently referred to as The Breyer Group Stadium for sponsorship purposes, and originally known as Osborne Road, is a football stadium in Brisbane Road, Leyton, east London, England. It has been the home ground of Leyton Orient since 1937, before which it was the home of amateur football team Leyton F.C., who moved to the Hare and Hounds ground. The highest attendance at the ground was 34,345 for the visit of West Ham United in the 1964 FA Cup. It has hosted a number of England U-16 and England women’s team matches. It hosted the 2007–08 FA Women's Premier League Cup final. It was also home of the Tottenham Hotspur Reserves. In 2012 Brisbane Road hosted the final of the inaugural NextGen series, a competition for the academy sides of elite clubs.\n\nBrisbane Road has seen several developments in its history, but due to the second world war the first major improvement was the levelling of a grass bank and crash barrier installation in 1949. The terracing behind the goals was improved again in 1952, 1959 and 1960. In 1956 a small seated stand was dismantled and replaced with a stand from the decrepit Mitcham Stadium, which held 2,600 fans. In 1962, with Leyton Orient gaining promotion to the First Division, another wing was added to the main stand making the seating total 3,500. In 1978 the West Stand was converted into all-seating. In 1996 the terracing at the southern end of the ground was demolished, and used as a car park while Lottery funding to build a stand was (unsuccessfully) sought. The South Stand was eventually built in 1999, and was renamed The Tommy Johnston Stand on 5 September 2008.\n\nThe ground is named after Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn's sports promotion company, Matchroom Sport, prior to which it was officially the Leyton Stadium, though fans still refer to it as Brisbane Road. The club registered an interest into moving into the Olympic Stadium following the 2012 Olympics, as the original plan was for this to have a capacity of about 25,000; however, the club's average attendance of about 5,000 meant that this was not a viable move. The eventual bids from both West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur to move into the stadium, with capacity nearer 60,000, effectively ended Orient's interest. Brisbane Road is in very close proximity to both the Olympic Park and also Hackney Marshes.\n\nOn 6 May 2012, Brisbane Road hosted a Super League game between London Broncos and Bradford Bulls due to works on the Broncos' home stadium Twickenham Stoop, with Bradford winning 22–29.\n\nCapacity: 2,918\n\nThe West Stand is the new main stand at Brisbane Road and currently seats home supporters only. It has a capacity of 2,918, with 23 disabled supporters and their helpers. The letters L O F C are marked into the seats in black. It is also home to the club's offices, and the club shop and ticket office are at the back of this stand. There is also a row of executive seating (the Directors' Balcony) above the main seating which overhangs the rest of the stand, and the Olympic Suite which offers corporate hospitality. This stand also has premium seating (with its own bar) in its centre, known as the Gallery. It has two refreshment outlets at either end underneath the stand and it is accessed by turnstiles at either end via Oliver Road, or via the main reception for Gallery members and Olympic Suite diners.\n\nThe players' changing rooms are also located underneath this stand and players emerge from the tunnel here. The dugouts are also located at the front of this stand after being moved from the opposite East Stand for the start of the 2006–07 season.\n\nCapacity: 3,636\n\nThe East Stand, previously the main stand, is the oldest stand at Brisbane Road and is used by both home and away supporters. When an away team is allocated the entire stand for safety or other reasons, Orient fans in the North half of the stand are required to move elsewhere to accommodate the extra away fans. The capacity of the Northern end of this stand is 2,133 and the Southern end is 1,459. There are also executive seats in the middle of the stand (the old directors' box, now known as the Wyvern Suite) but these are not ordinarily used by any supporters.\n\n\nCapacity: 1,381\n\nThe North Stand was completed for the start of the 2007–08 season and is currently used as a family stand. It replaces a former open terrace, has a capacity of 1,351 with provision for 15 disabled supporters and their helpers, and has the letters L O F C marked into the seats in black. Access to this stand is by turnstiles at each end of the stand and there are two refreshment outlets located underneath the stand.\n\nThe stand has been sponsored by the CEO of Baskin Robbins, Nigel Travis, since 2012. Travis, a lifelong Orient fan, purchased the club itself in 2017.\n\nCapacity: 1,336\n\nThis stand was built in 1999 and was formerly called the South Stand. It was renamed the 'Tommy Johnston Stand' in 2008 in memory of Leyton Orient's record goalscorer Tommy Johnston, but is currently referred to by the club as the Tommy Johnston South Stand. It is currently for home supporters only and has a capacity of 1,336. It has a refreshment outlet and a bar underneath the stand and is accessed through turnstiles from Buckingham Road. It has the word ORIENT marked into the seats in white. A large block of flats backs on to the stand.\n\n"}

{"id": "1260585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1260585", "title": "Color commentator", "text": "Color commentator\n\nA color commentator or expert commentator is a sports commentator who assists the main commentator, often by filling in any time when play is not in progress. The phrase \"color commentator\" is primarily used in American English; the concept may also be referred to as a summariser (outside North America) or analyst (a term used throughout the English-speaking world). The color analyst and main commentator will often exchange comments freely throughout the broadcast, when the play-by-play announcer is not describing the action. The color commentator provides expert analysis and background information, such as statistics, strategy, and injury reports on the teams and athletes, and occasionally anecdotes or light humor. Color commentators are often former athletes or coaches of the sport being broadcast.\n\nThe term \"color\" refers to levity and insight provided by a secondary announcer. A sports color commentator customarily works alongside the play-by-play broadcaster.\n\nCommentary teams typically feature one professional commentator describing the passage of play, and another, usually a former player or coach, providing supplementary input as the game progresses. The color commentator will usually restrict his input to periods when the ball or puck is out of play or there is no significant action on the field and will defer to the main commentator whenever there is a shot on goal or other significant event, sometimes resulting in their being talked-over or cut short by the primary commentator. Additionally, former players and managers appear as pundits, carrying out a similar role to the co-commentator during the pre-game show preceding a given contest and the post-game show following it. In American motorsports coverage, there may be as many as two color commentators in the booth for a given broadcast. A rules analyst, typically a former official, may comment on rules enforcement and replays.\n\nIn the past, American sports broadcasts often employed three-man booths, with two color commentators, one who is a former player or coach, and the other with a journalism or entertainment background; \"Monday Night Football\" was famous for this format, employing Howard Cosell as their \"outsider\" commentator for over a decade and later hiring comedian Dennis Miller and then newspaper columnist Tony Kornheiser for the same position.\n\nWWE is a primary example of the three-man booth, with main commentator Michael Cole, and two color commentators Corey Graves and Renee Young on the flagship show RAW.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the role of \"color commentator\" is relatively unknown; the equivalent role is usually called \"summariser\" but also known as \"analyst\", \"pundit\", or simply \"co-commentator\". Cricket coverage on ESPNcricinfo uses similar terminology.\n\nIn Australia, the term is not used. Those giving the analysis alongside the main commentator are sometimes said to be giving additional or expert analysis, or are \"special comments,\" or may be referred to as \"expert commentators.\"\n\nFor football broadcasts on Latin American sports television channels, this type of commentator is called a \"comentarista\" in both Spanish and Portuguese, in contrast with the \"narrador\", \"locutor\" (Portuguese) or \"relator\" (Spanish) who leads the transmission. There is no mention or translation to the term \"color\".\n\nIn Denmark, Norway and Sweden the position is known as \"ekspertkommentator\" / \"expertkommentator\" (expert commentator), whereas the play-by-play announcer is called \"hovedkommentator\" / \"huvudkommentator\" (head commentator) or simply \"kommentator\".\n\nIn Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries, the position is known as a \"comentarista\" and \"comentador\" (commentator; \"comentarista\" in Brazilian Portuguese), respectively, in contrast with the \"narrador\" (narrator) who describes the action. Similarly, in Finland \"kommentaattori\" is used for the second commentator, and \"selostaja\" (explainer) for the main one.\n\nIn France, the term for a color commentator is \"consultant\", as opposed to the \"commentateur sportif\" (who is also a journalist).\n\nIn Italy, the color commentator is usually referred to as responsible for the \"commento tecnico\" (technical comment) whereas the play-by-play commentator is the main \"telecronista\". In Italy, too, the color commentator is usually a person formerly directly involved in the sport (as an athlete/player/pilot or as a coach). Recent Formula 1 races have no fewer than three commentators: the \"telecronista\", a former pilot, and an engineer, the last two sharing the \"commento tecnico\".\n\nIn Turkey, the term \"spiker\" is used for the play-by-play announcer whereas the color commentator is referred to simply as \"yorumcu\" (commentator).\n\nIn some countries, the two-person commentating team is not used as much as elsewhere. In Germany, most broadcasts of sports matches traditionally feature a single play-by-play announcer who also provides commentary, background information, and statistics. If the broadcast is on TV, the announcer will usually not comment on visually obvious things. A two-person commentating team is used more often for sports where understanding of events depends more on details and subtle visual cues that not everybody might instantly get or might need extra information in order to reasonably understand – for example in auto racing or winter sport. In those cases, a current or former athlete or coach is often used as co-commentator or \"Experte\" (expert).\n\nThough not always the case, in professional wrestling, the color commentator is usually a \"heel sympathizer\" (or a supporter of the \"bad guys\") as opposed to the play-by-play announcer, who is more or less the \"voice of the fans\" as well as supporters of the \"good guys\" (or babyfaces). Though both are supposed to show neutral stance while announcing, the color commentators (especially when they support heels) are usually more blatant about their stance than the play-by-play announcers. \n\nJesse \"The Body\" Ventura and Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan pioneered the \"heel sympathizer\" for color commentary in wrestling. Jerry \"The King\" Lawler later made a successful transition into the role, though Lawler has since shown more sympathy for faces (partially due to being over with fans after nearly forty years in wrestling). In some cases, commentators are also active managers for wrestlers, usually following continuity as heels. Former Extreme Championship Wrestling color commentator Cyrus was known for having dual roles as a heel manager and a somewhat neutral commentator. It has also been used to keep injured wrestlers in the public eye while they recuperate. Special guest color commentators serve a twofold purpose, the primary is usually to place them in position to interfere with the match they are calling, but also serves to tell the promotors if this performer can \"talk\" on his own in the ad lib driven commentary role.\n"}

{"id": "3569329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3569329", "title": "Eddie (film)", "text": "Eddie (film)\n\nEddie is a 1996 comedy film starring Whoopi Goldberg and Frank Langella. The film barely broke even at the box office, grossing $31,387,164 in the US. The film was directed by Steve Rash.\n\nThe New York Knicks are also-rans in the NBA, their roster filled with players who either lack talent or are too distracted by off-the-court issues. Nonetheless, limousine driver and rabid fan Edwina \"Eddie\" Franklin (Whoopi Goldberg) attends every Knicks game in the nosebleed section of Madison Square Garden.\n\nDuring halftime of a game, Eddie wins a contest to be honorary coach of the Knicks for the second half. She quickly gets on the nerves of head coach John Bailey (Dennis Farina), whom she had heckled earlier. Eddie's popularity piques the interest of the new Knicks owner, \"Wild Bill\" Burgess (Frank Langella). After he forces Bailey to quit, Burgess names Eddie the new head coach.\n\nAt first, she is treated with skepticism and derision. However, she understands that the Knicks have the talent to win, but the players' individual problems have caused the team to underperform. Center Ivan Radovadovitch, from Georgia (sometimes referred to as a \"Russian\"), focuses only on scoring, and his lack of defensive technique leads him to frequently commit unnecessary blocking fouls. Superstar forward Stacy Patton's me-first approach causes him to force low percentage shots because he is unwilling to pass, and his poor attitude hurts the team's morale - for example, he keeps referring to himself in the third person. Rookie Jamal Duncan's occupation with being a rap star keeps him from focusing on his game, especially his free throws. Power Forward Terry Hastings' pending divorce from his wife due to an extramarital affair in Phoenix has a negative effect on his play on the court. At a pivotal moment in practice, Eddie earns the team's respect by taking a hard foul from Patton in order to demonstrate proper defense to Ivan. Eddie also begins to bench Patton in favor of veteran Nate Wilson, who was generally considered washed up because of chronic knee injuries. Wilson experiences a late career resurgence, the Knicks begin to win, and New York City embraces the team and Eddie's colorful personality.\n\nThe team's winning streak eclipses their abysmal start, and as the season winds down, the Knicks are within reach of the playoffs. In order to qualify, they will need to beat the Charlotte Hornets, now coached by John Bailey, in the last game of the season.\n\nThe night before the game, Burgess tells Eddie that if the Knicks win, he will sell the team to a group that intends to relocate the team to St. Louis, Missouri (this is a veiled reference to Georgia Frontiere's similar move of the Los Angeles Rams to St. Louis upon her assumption of the Rams ownership in 1995). A conflicted Eddie doesn't show to the game until right before tip-off.\n\nDuring the game, Hornets forward Larry Johnson proves difficult to contain, but strong play from Wilson keeps the score close. Bailey responds by telling Johnson to foul Wilson hard in the hopes of knocking him out of the game. Johnson makes an unsuccessful attempt right before halftime: Wilson is hurt, but he is able to hit both foul shots and continue playing. In the fourth quarter Johnson blows out Wilson's knee, forcing him out of the game. Patton enters the game and shows a new team-first attitude, particularly on the Knicks' last offensive possession. Eddie begins to diagram a play to get Patton the ball for a final shot, but assistant coach Carl Zimmer instead suggests that Bailey, remembering Patton's tendency to force low percentage shots, will swarm him with defenders. The Knicks instead inbound to Patton, who passes to an open teammate after three defenders come to him. The Knicks take a one-point lead with seconds left in the game.\n\nNow, with the Knicks on the cusp of winning, Eddie realizes that a victory will cause the team to be relocated to St. Louis. She decides to get on the Garden's PA system and reveal the entire plan to the world. The fans react with shock and anger, and a frustrated Burgess is forced to promise the crowd he won't sell the team or move them out of New York City.\n\nWhen play resumes, the Hornets have one last chance to win. Bailey tells his team to get the ball to Johnson and have him drive the lane, expecting Ivan to commit a blocking foul. Instead, Ivan remains set in his defensive position and Johnson is called for charging, which nullifies the basket, giving the Knicks the win and the playoff berth.\n\nThe film ends without explaining what happens to the Knicks in the playoffs that year.\n\n\nPlayers from several NBA teams played major roles, including Alex English as the Cleveland Cavaliers' coach, Dwayne Schintzius, Greg Ostertag, and Rick Fox. Dennis Rodman, Muggsy Bogues, Vinny Del Negro, Vlade Divac, Bobby Phills, J. R. Reid, Terrell Brandon, Brad Daugherty, Mitch Richmond, Avery Johnson, Corie Blount, Larry Johnson, Randy Brown, Olden Polynice, and Scott Burrell appeared as themselves. Gary Payton, Anthony Mason, Herb Williams, and John Starks appeared as streetballers. Kurt Rambis appeared as the head coach of the Lakers. Chris Berman, Marv Albert and Walt Frazier also appeared in the movie as broadcasters.\n\nDonald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Edward Koch, Fabio, and David Letterman also appeared in the movie. Gene Anthony Ray (who played Leroy in both Fame the series and the 1980 film) also features as associate choreographer, one of his last credits before his death in 2003.\n\nDuring the production of the film Goldberg and Langella started dating, their relationship lasted until 2001.\n\nThe film received negative reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 15% based on reviews from 33 critics. Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars.\nWhoopi Goldberg was nominated for a Razzie Award as Worst Actress for her performance.\n\nA soundtrack containing hip hop and R&B music was released on May 21, 1996 by PolyGram Records. It peaked at 119 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and 44 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.\n\n1. https://web.archive.org/web/19981206002007/http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/eddie.html . See also \n\n"}
{"id": "2159943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159943", "title": "Fargodome", "text": "Fargodome\n\nGate City Bank Field at the Fargodome is an indoor athletic stadium located in Fargo, North Dakota, on the campus of North Dakota State University (NDSU). Opened in late 1992, the facility is owned by the City of Fargo, built on university land. The arena's seating capacity is 18,700 for football and over 25,000 for full arena concerts.\n\nIt is the home field of the North Dakota State Bison football team, which competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). The Bison Football team is a member of the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Prior to the 1993 season, the Bison played at Dacotah Field. The stadium also plays host to North Dakota State graduation ceremonies as well as many large concerts, other sporting events, and trade shows.\n\nThe building was originally planned to be modeled on the Tacoma Dome and have an inflatable roof. However, as the design evolved, it was decided to have a fixed hard roof, although the dome name stuck.\n\nThe Fargodome has held events such as the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, USHRA's Monster Jam, Rib Fest, World Wrestling Entertainment, World Championship Wrestling, and other local, regional, and national events.\n\nThe Asics/Vaughan Cadet and Junior National Wrestling Championships (freestyle, Greco-Roman wrestling) takes place every year in the Fargodome in the month of July.\n\nMany famous acts have played the Fargodome including Avenged Sevenfold, Katy Perry, Cher, Guns N' Roses, Fleetwood Mac, Journey, The Rolling Stones, Pearl Jam, Garth Brooks, Bon Jovi, Van Halen, Shania Twain, Taylor Swift, AC/DC, Paul McCartney, Kenny Chesney, The Dave Matthews Band, Carrie Underwood, Aerosmith, Poison, Nsync, Neil Diamond, Billy Joel, Kiss, Beach Boys, Faith Hill, Bryan Adams, Ozzy Osbourne, Luke Bryan, Pink, Reba McEntire, Dixie Chicks, Lady Antebellum, Bruce Springsteen, Tim McGraw, Def Leppard, Metallica, Prince, Justin Timberlake, and many others. The Fargodome is also capable of hosting events on ice such as Disney on Ice, and traveling broadway.\n\nThe Fargodome's Gate City Bank Theatre is home to theatrical productions, produced locally and touring.\n\nNDSU Bison Football Games\n\nThe Fargodome is currently studying an expansion of its permanent seating. The current capacity is 18,700 with an additional 100 seats to be added during the winter 2015. The addition of 5,000 to 7,500 seats has been discussed since 2011, but is now being seriously considered after several straight years of sold out NDSU Bison football games. That would bring the total capacity for football games to around 25,000. The additional seating would require major structural changes to the dome, including moving the press boxes from the east side to the west side. The west side has been reinforced and could handle extra levels, whereas the east side has a lobby that was not designed to bear any extra load.\n\nIn summer 2016, the stadium video boards were replaced with 12 new interior displays featuring SMD LED technology including two large 30'x100' High Definition video/scoreboards on each endzone, 12'x24' screens behind those large screens for those seated behind the board, and four large 20'x22' High Definition video boards (one in each corner), the $7.7 million project also provided for four ribbon displays on the seating fascia 3' high and 33' long along with a portable 15' x 25' screen which can be moved around on gameday, the project also renovated the electronics room and provided for new computer and graphics technology. These screens replaced the 6 old boards installed in 2002. In total, the new boards provide for of LED boards in the dome. The contract also provided for an increase from 3 to 5 High Definition cameras for additional angles, one of the cameras has a 55x extra zoom for close up play.\n\nIn 2011, the Fargodome was ranked as the 49th best stadium in college football by \"BleacherReport.com\". The article cites, \"There aren't many indoor venues in college football, but the few that do exist at the non-FBS level are very unfriendly to any visiting team. That effect is only amplified in a playoff atmosphere.\" The Fargodome is routinely ranked as one of the loudest college football stadiums in the country. On December 14, 2012 in an FCS semifinal game against Georgia Southern, the crowd noise exceeded the 111 decibel mark and was known to be one of the loudest games in NDSU history. The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead conducted an informal study of Fargodome crowd noise from the press box during a playoff semifinal game last December. The readings showed a high of 111 decibels following a late touchdown by quarterback Brock Jensen. The decibel meter consistently read 102-106 throughout that game, according to The Forum. During the 2013 Furman playoff game, the crowd noise was measured at 115 decibels.\n\n"}

{"id": "711365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=711365", "title": "New Era Field", "text": "New Era Field\n\nNew Era Field, originally Rich Stadium and later Ralph Wilson Stadium, is a stadium in Orchard Park, New York, a suburb south of Buffalo. Opened in 1973, it is the home of the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). New Era Cap Company holds the stadium's naming rights.\n\nAn original franchise of the American Football League in 1960, the Buffalo Bills played their first thirteen seasons at War Memorial Stadium, a multi-use WPA project stadium that opened in 1938, located on Buffalo's East Side. While suitable for AFL play in the 1960s, the \"Rockpile\" (as the stadium came to be nicknamed), was in disrepair and with a capacity of under 47,000, undersized for a National Football League team. The league mandate instituted after the AFL–NFL merger of 1970 dictated a minimum of 50,000 seats.\n\nIn early 1971, owner Ralph Wilson was exploring options to relocate the team, possibly to Seattle, with other cities such as Memphis and Tampa soon expressing interest as well. The potential loss of the team hastened the stadium project and Rich Stadium opened in 1973. The location and construction of the stadium in Erie County were the source of years of litigation, which ended with a financial settlement for a developer who had planned to erect a domed stadium in Lancaster. However, plans changed because it was not wanted to be close to Lancaster High School. The stadium was ultimately built by Frank Schoenle and his construction company. Bonds were approved by the county legislature in September 1971.\n\nRich Products, a Buffalo-based food products company, signed a 25-year, $1.5 million deal ($60,000 per year), by which the venue would be called \"Rich Stadium\"; one of the earliest examples of the sale of naming rights in North American sports. (The name was somewhat of a compromise, after Bills owner and founder Ralph Wilson rejected the name Rich wanted to use, \"Coffee Rich Park.\") By a vote of 16 to 4, the county legislature approved the name in November 1972, despite a matching offer from Wilson to name it \"Buffalo Bills Stadium.\"\n\nWhen the Bills organization regularly referred to the stadium without the \"Rich\" name, Rich Products brought a $7.5 million lawsuit against the team in 1976. After the original deal expired after a quarter century in 1998, the stadium was renamed in honor of Wilson. Rich Products balked at paying a greatly increased rights fee, which would have brought the price up to par with other NFL stadiums.\n\nOn August 13, 2016, Buffalo-based New Era Cap Company and the Buffalo Bills reached an agreement for naming rights. The Bills and New Era officially announced the stadium's new name of New Era Field five days later, on August 18, 2016.\n\nThe first NFL playoff game at the stadium came in the 1988 season, a 17–10 Bills victory over the Houston Oilers on January 1, 1989. The Bills won every ensuing playoff game at the stadium until they were defeated in 1996 by the Jacksonville Jaguars on December 28.\n\nFrom New Era Field's opening until the end of the 2017 NFL season, the Bills have defeated each of the 31 other teams there at least once and are unbeaten there against the following teams: Arizona Cardinals (4-0), Baltimore Ravens (2-0), Green Bay Packers (6-0), and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2-0).\n\nThe stadium is open-air, with a capacity of 71,870. It has never had a natural grass surface; AstroTurf was installed in the stadium upon its opening in 1973. The first renovation occurred in 1984 when the stadium's capacity was increased to 80,290 with the addition of 16 executive suites. Eight years later in 1992, 24 more executive suites were added. In 1994, major renovations were made to the stadium including the addition of the Red Zone and Goal Line clubs that are enclosed in glass and have 500 seats. These renovations also added 14 executive suites. A massive $9.1 million (inflation adjusted) Sony JumboTron video scoreboard was a major update in 1994 and was the largest in the U.S. at the time. In 1998, $57 million were spent to refit the stadium with larger seats and more luxury and club seating as a part of the Bills lease renewal with Erie County, New York. This caused the seating capacity to be reduced to just under 74,000. In the 2003 offseason, the original style turf was replaced with a newer AstroTurf product, AstroTurf GameDay Grass (also known as AstroPlay). The lease agreement also stipulated Erie County would continue to upgrade the stadium; in the summer of 2007, a new High Definition Mitsubishi LED board measuring was installed and replaced the 13-year-old Sony Jumbotron. Over 1,000 ft of Mitsubishi Diamond Vision LED Ribbon Boards were also installed in the interior during that renovation. The total cost for the 2007 project was $5.2 million, In 2011, the Bills changed their turf to a new product, A-Turf Titan, produced by a Western New York company. As of the 2011 season, Buffalo is the only NFL stadium using the A-Turf Titan product. On December 21, 2012, the lease negotiations between the Bills, Erie County, and the state of New York ended with the Bills signing a ten-year lease to stay in Buffalo until 2023. The agreement included $130 million in improvements to New Era Field. Renovations included new larger entrance gates, larger HD sponsor boards added to each side of the video scoreboard, two new 33.6 ft by 59.84 ft high definition video boards, larger LED sponsor board added on the tunnel end of the stadium, expanded concessions, new team store, and redesign of areas and lots just outside the entrance gates.\n\nBuffalo, by virtue of its position downwind of Lake Erie, is one of the nation's windiest cities, and as a result, New Era Field often is a difficult stadium for kickers, with swirling winds that change direction rapidly. This is exacerbated by the stadium's design. The field is below ground level, while the top of the upper deck stands only 60 feet above ground. The open end lies parallel to the direction of the prevailing winds, so when the winds come in, they immediately drop down into the bowl, causing the stadium's signature wind patterns.\n\nThe size of the field at New Era Field is specifically designed for National Football League dimensions and sight lines, making it extremely difficult for other outdoor sporting events such as soccer, baseball, track and field, or rugby to be held there. None of any significance have ever been held at the stadium.\n\nSyracuse University played several home games at the stadium in 1979. Syracuse was left without an on-campus home for one season between the demolition of Archbold Stadium and the construction of the Carrier Dome.\n\nOn January 1, 2008, the Buffalo Sabres hosted the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first NHL Winter Classic. The Penguins won 2–1 in a shootout in front of 71,217. On December 29, 2017, the stadium hosted a match between the U.S. and Canada at the 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships being hosted by Buffalo.\n\nThe stadium annually hosts the region's Section VI and Monsignor Martin Athletic Association high school football playoffs. The stadium rarely hosts college football games; the stadium hosted a Black Friday contest between the UB Bulls and the Bowling Green Falcons in 2013, but before that, the last college football game at the stadium had been in 1979, when the Syracuse Orange football team used the stadium as a temporary venue while the Carrier Dome was under construction.\n\nThe opening ceremony of the 1993 Summer Universiade was held at the stadium.\n\nAdjacent to the stadium is 1,800-seat West-Herr Field, the home field for Erie Community College's football team.\n\nOn July 14, 1984, the stadium hosted a one-time-only supercross motorcycle racing event.\n\nNearly 30 concerts have been held at the stadium, starting in 1974 with Eric Clapton and The Band.\n\nSeveral bands have played the stadium multiple times, including The Rolling Stones, who played there in 1975, 1978, 1981, 1997, and 2015. The Grateful Dead played the stadium a few times in the 80's and early 90's with their July 4, 1989 \"Truckin' Up to Buffalo\" performance being documented on CD/DVD. The Who, Dave Matthews Band, and The Jackson Five have all played at the stadium multiple times as well.\n\nDouble and multi-billed concerts have also been scheduled at the stadium. \n\nThere were notable large concerts that were scheduled to take place at the stadium but were later canceled. Led Zeppelin was set to perform at the stadium on their 1977 North American Tour. The concert was one of the seven remaining concerts on the tour that were canceled due to the death of lead singer Robert Plant's son. A Bruce Springsteen concert, that was originally scheduled at the stadium in 2003, was moved to the smaller Darien Lake Performing Arts Center due to low ticket sales.\n\nConcert appearances began to wane in the 1990s at the stadium, which ended with Dave Matthews Band and NSYNC each playing a concert in June 2001, with no more concerts at the stadium for 14 years. The combination of a declining number of stadium rock acts, population decline, and the availability of other, more intimate, venues in Western New York such as Artpark in Lewiston, New York, Darien Lake Performing Arts Center in Corfu, New York, the Thursday at the Square series among others, Seneca Niagara Casino, and the KeyBank Center, which opened in 1996, replacing Buffalo Memorial Auditorium in downtown Buffalo\n\nThe stadium has also hosted the Drum Corps International championships three times.\n\nAutocross racing events are held in the one of the stadium's parking lots during the spring, summer, and fall months. The local WNY SCCA Chapter hosts the autocrosses.\n\nAlthough new stadium ideas had been proposed before the death of Ralph Wilson, with the new ownership of Terry and Kim Pegula, the prospect of a new stadium has been raised again. During his press conference to acquire the team, Terry Pegula stated, \"we will gradually proceed to plan and design a stadium for the Buffalo Bills.\"\n\nSince the Bills moved from War Memorial Stadium into their current home, it has been noted that the team has not won a championship since, and has had frequent periods of heartbreak. Several writers have owed this to the fact that the stadium is built just yards away from a family cemetery as part of territory once owned by the Sheldon Family. A plaque just outside the stadium at gates 6-7 graces the cemetery and also notes that the stadium was built on the site of an ancient Wenro village.\n\n\n\n"}

It was mentioned in the Göttingen manuscript of 1490 and was later analysed by masters such as Gioachino Greco in the 17th century. In the 18th century, it was recommended by Phillip Stamma and is sometimes known as the Aleppo Gambit in his honour. During the early period of modern chess, queen pawn openings were not in fashion and the Queen's Gambit did not become common until the 1873 tournament in Vienna.\n\nAs Wilhelm Steinitz and Siegbert Tarrasch developed chess theory and increased the appreciation of , the Queen's Gambit grew more popular, reaching its zenith in the 1920s and 1930s, and was played in all but two of 34 games in the 1927 World Championship match between José Raúl Capablanca and Alexander Alekhine.\n\nAfter the resumption of international chess activity following World War II, it was less frequently seen, as many Black players moved away from symmetrical openings, tending to use Indian Defences to combat queen pawn openings.\n\nThe Queen's Gambit is still frequently played and it remains an important part of many grandmasters' opening repertoires.\nWith 2.c4, White threatens to exchange a wing pawn (the c-pawn) for a centre pawn (Black's d-pawn) and dominate the with e2–e4. This is not a true gambit, as Black cannot hold the pawn, for example: 1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.e3 b5? (Black tries to guard his pawn but should pursue with 3...e5!) 4.a4 c6? 5.axb5 cxb5 6.Qf3! winning a piece.\n\nThe Queen's Gambit is divided into two major categories based on Black's response: the Queen's Gambit Accepted (QGA) and the Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD). In the QGA, Black plays 2...dxc4, temporarily giving up the centre to obtain freer development. In the QGD, Black usually plays to hold d5. Frequently Black will be cramped, but Black aims to exchange pieces and use the at c5 and e5 to free his game.\n\nAfter 1.d4 d5 2.c4:\n\nTechnically, any Black response other than 2...dxc4 (or another line with an early ...dxc4 that transposes into the QGA) is a Queen's Gambit Declined, but the Slav, Albin Countergambit, and Chigorin Defense are generally treated separately. There are so many QGD lines after 2...e6, that many of them are distinctive enough to warrant separate treatment. The Orthodox Defense and the Tarrasch Defense are two important examples. See Queen's Gambit Declined for more.\nThere are many other possible responses:\n\nIf White chooses to fianchetto his king's bishop, the game transposes into the Catalan Opening.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "991470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=991470", "title": "Sokol", "text": "Sokol\n\nThe Sokol movement (, \"falcon\") is an all-age gymnastics organization first founded in Prague in the Czech region of Austria-Hungary in 1862 by Miroslav Tyrš and Jindřich Fügner. It was based upon the principle of \"a strong mind in a sound body\". The Sokol, through lectures, discussions, and group outings provided what Tyrš viewed as physical, moral, and intellectual training for the nation. This training extended to men of all ages and classes, and eventually to women.\n\nThe movement also spread across all the regions populated by Slavic cultures: (Poland (Sokół), Slovene Lands, Serbia (SK Soko), Bulgaria, the Russian Empire (Poland, Ukraine, Belarus), and the rest of Austria-Hungary (i.e., present day Slovenia and Croatia). In many of these nations, the organization also served as an early precursor to the Scouting movements. Though officially an institution \"above politics\", the Sokol played an important part in the development of Czech nationalism, providing a forum for the spread of mass-based nationalist ideologies. The articles published in the Sokol journal, lectures held in the Sokol libraries, and theatrical performances at the massive gymnastic festivals called \"slets\" helped to craft and disseminate the Czech nationalist mythology and version of history.\n\nThe idea for physical training centers was not a new one. The Sokol movement consciously traced its roots in physical education to the athletes and warriors of Ancient Greece. More directly, the nature of the Sokol was influenced by the German Turnverein, mass-based, nationalist-minded gymnastics societies founded by Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in 1811.\n\nMiroslav Tyrš, the founder of the first Sokol in Prague in 1862, continued as the most influential figure in the movement until his death in 1884. Born Friedrich Emanuel Tirsch into a German-speaking family in 1834, Tyrš grew up under the influence of the Romantic nationalism that gave rise to the uprisings that swept across Europe in 1848. He received a thorough education at the University of Prague, where he majored in philosophy. It was not until the early 1860s that he became involved in the Czech nationalist cause, and changed his name to the Slavic form. After he failed to find a position in academia, Tyrš combined his experience working as a therapeutic gymnastics trainer with the nationalist ideologies he had been exposed to in Prague: the first Sokol club was formed.\n\nThe first Sokol worked to develop new Czech terminology for the training exercises, which centred on marching drills, fencing, and weightlifting. They designed a uniform that was a mélange of Slavic and revolutionary influences: brown Russian trousers, a Polish revolutionary jacket, a Montenegrin cap, and a red Garibaldi shirt. A Sokol flag, red with a white falcon, was designed by the writer Karolína Světlá (and painted by Czech artist Josef Mánes).\n\nThe Prague Sokol initially drew its leaders from the ranks of politicians and its members from the petite bourgeoisie and the working classes. The first president was Jindřich Fügner, an ethnic German who was a member of the Czech cause. Most founders were also members of the Young Czechs party, the most influential including Prince Rudolf von Thurn-Taxis, Josef Barák, and Julius and Eduard Grégr. The authorities of Austria-Hungary continually kept a close eye on the movement, but the reputation and prestige of the Sokol continued to grow; soon the Sokol members were known by most as the \"Czech national army\".\n\nWithin the first year the Sokols expanded beyond Prague, first into the Moravia and the Slovenian regions of the Hapsburg empire. Initially the majority of members were students and professionals, but over time there was a trend towards increasingly working class members.\n\nThe Sokol training went through periods of greater militarized training, during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, when Sokol members were hired as guards for public events. This militaristic side of the Sokol movement continued to resurface throughout its history.\n\nThe internal issues that were to plague the Sokol movement over the years emerged almost immediately. These internal arguments reached fruition during the 1870s with the power struggle in leadership between the members of Old Czechs and the Young Czechs parties. Theoretically, the Sokol was a society “above politics.” Always flamboyantly nationalistic, the more conservative members of the Sokol argued that the organization should maintain its distance from politics while the Young Czech members advocated more direct political participation. Theoretically, the Sokol was also open equally to members of all classes. The informal “thou” (\"ty\") was used by all members, but there were constant arguments over whether this was necessary or not. Different leaders believed that the Sokol was a mass-based institution defined by its working class members, while others viewed it more as a middle class apparatus by which to educate and raise the national consciousness of the working classes.\n\nIn 1882, the first slet was held. \"Slet\" came from the Czech word for \"a flocking of birds\" (Czech plural: \"slety\"). The same word exists or can be synthesized from common Slavic roots in other Slavic languages. It meant a mass gymnastics (1572 Sokols) festival that became a grand tradition within the Sokol movement that spread across Central Europe together with other Slavic movements such as the political movement of Pan-Slavism. The first and subsequent slets included an elaborate welcoming ceremony at the train station, mass demonstrations, gymnastics competitions, speeches, and theatrical events, open to members of all Sokols.\n\nIn 1887 the Habsburg authorities finally allowed, after over twenty years worth of proposals, the formation of a union of Sokol clubs – Czech Sokol Community (\"Česká obec sokolská\", ČOS). The union centralized all the Sokols in the Czech lands and sent Sokol trainers to the rest of the Slavic world to found Sokol institutions in Kraków, Ljubljana, Zagreb, and even the Russian Empire (FC Spartak Moscow) (mostly the Ukrainian lands).\n\nIn 1889, though officially forbidden by the authorities, members of the Prague Sokol went to the World's Fair in Paris. There they won several medals and established strong connections with French gymnasts and the French public. The Sokols have been credited with establishing the beginning of the strong French sympathy for the Czechs and their subsequent political alliances on this trip.\n\nThe 1890s were a progressive era for the Sokols. In order to encourage a wider range of participation, the Sokols reformed their programs, offering training sessions of varying intensities, extending their libraries, emphasizing the educational aspect of training, and starting programs for adolescents, youth, and women. There was an increasing focus on mass-based ideology and working class egalitarianism under the leadership of the Young Czechs, namely Jan Podlipný, who was also the mayor of Prague 1897–1900.\n\nThe second slet was held in 1891 (over 5,000 Sokols) and the third one soon afterwards in 1895. At this third slet the congress of the Sokol union laid out its progressive new trajectory in the St. Wenceslas Day (September 28) Resolutions. The leaders chose to continue to provide more accessible forms of training, with less focus on competition and more on an egalitarian idea of people's gymnastics balancing mental as well as physical education.\n\nThe rise of the Social Democrats and agrarian parties in the political arena played out in Sokol politics as well as national ones. The Social Democrats formed a rival gymnastics society, the Workers' Gymnastics Club (\"Dělnická tělovýchovná jednota\", DTJ). Václav Kukař, a powerful ČOS figure, developed the policy of \"cleansing\" (\"očištění\") and sought to limit membership to those who he believed demonstrated commitment to purely Czech causes. Most of the progressive members of the Sokols were purged or left voluntarily to join the DTJ. Another rival gymnast society was founded by the Christian-Socialist party under the name Orel (\"Eagle\"). In the face of such competition, the Sokols set about reaffirming their traditional mission under the leadership of Josef Scheiner.\n\nThe fourth slet, held in 1901 (11,000 Sokols), boasted a large international participation, including Galician Poles, Ukrainians, Slovenes, Croats, Russians, Bulgarians, Serbs, as well as Frenchmen and Americans. This slet also marked the first appearance of women who grew to be a major part of Sokol members in the following decades.\n\nThe fifth slet, held in 1907 (over 12,000 Sokols), had an increasingly Slavic focus and moved away from the more egalitarian idea of people's gymnastics with increased competition aspects. It marked the creation of the Federation of Slavic Sokols under the neo-Slavic idea of the Czechs as the strongest Slavic nation, second only to Russia.\n\nAt the 1910 meeting of the ČOS congress the sokols reaffirmed their intentions to remain \"above politics\" and loosened their strict membership rules to allow Social Democrats, though still not clericals, into the sokols.\n\nIn 1912, the first \"All-Slavic Slet\" (\"Všeslovanský slet\", over 30,000 Sokols) was held with a largely military atmosphere, causing Augustin Očenášek (a member of Sokol) to remark, \"When the thunder comes and the nations rise up to defend their existence, let it be the Sokol clubs from which the cry to battle will sound...\". The cry to battle did sound two years later, when the first rumors of Franz Ferdinand's assassination reached the Sokol members, most of whom were attending a regional slet in Brno.\n\nWith the onset of World War I, in 1915 the Sokols were officially disbanded. Many members were active in persuading the Czechs to defect from the Austro-Hungarian army to the Russian side. Sokol members also helped create the Czechoslovak Legions and local patrols that kept order after the disintegration of Habsburg authority, and during the creation of Czechoslovakia in October 1918. They also fulfilled their title as the \"Czech national army\", helping to defend Slovakia against the invasion of Béla Kun and the Hungarians.\n\nThe Sokol flourished in the early interwar period, and by 1930 had 630,000 members. The Sokols held one last slet (350,000 Sokols) on the eve of the Munich Agreement of 1938 and were later brutally suppressed and banned during the Nazi occupation of Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nSlovenes organise gymnastic society 1. October 1863 and named it Južni Sokol (South Falcon). Sokol societies were introduced in Slovenia by Viktor Murnik in the last decade of 19th century. V. Murnik was good gymnast. He was inspired by Czech’s Sokols profession and studied Tyrš’s gymnastics\nbases. The 1903 All-Sokols Rally was held in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The official name of the Slovenian Sokol was Ljubljana Sokol and its starosta was Kajzelj and the coach was Murnik.\n\nIn Croatia, the Sokol movement had full support from Strossmayer, then Bishop of Đakovo. After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in 1918, and under the leadership of Lazar Car, Croatian Sokol societies were united with Serbian and Slovenian Sokol clubs into a large Sokol Alliance on 15 June 1919.\n\nThe Croatian clergy forced Croatian Sokols to leave the Yugoslav Sokol Alliance in 1919–20, fueling internal conflicts within the Alliance on political grounds. At the same time, high Catholic clergy established the Orlovi (Eagles) clerical organization with the aim of taking youths away from the Alliance. The Croatian Catholic Church rejected the pan-Slavic idea of bringing together Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim believers under the motto that \"a brother is dear regardless of his faith\". The two Catholic organizations, Orlovi (Eagles) and Katolička Akcija (Catholic Action) were a main base of this resistance to the idea of Yugoslavism, brotherhood and religious tolerance. The Catholic Church's resistance to this idea of pan-Slavism led the Polish Sokols to abstain from the international All Sokol Rally held in Prague in 1926.\n\nIn the Kingdom of Yugoslavia all Sokol societes were merged into the Union of Sokols of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as of December 1929. The Eagles were ordered to disband but they reinvented as religious fraternities. This way the Sokol movement was the principal agent of the drive for cultural synthesis of the Yugoslav society.\n\nMembers of Sokol who emigrated from Czechoslovakia set up small Sokol groups abroad. This Sokol migration, for a variety of reasons, began even before Czechoslovakia became a nation in 1918, intensified as a result of the World Wars and the Communist suppression, and continues to this day. Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak immigrants and Czech-American citizens started the American Sokol Organization in St. Louis Missouri in 1865, only three years after the first Prague Sokol. Units quickly formed and by 1878, the United States had 13 Sokol chapters. By 1937, American Sokol membership rolls counted nearly 20,000 adults in areas as far-flung as New York City, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Oakland, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, St. Louis, Texas, Nyack and parts of Canada. Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska, who was of Czech heritage, was a lifelong member of Sokol Omaha.\n\nAfter World War II Sokols held one more \"slet\" in 1948 before they were once again suppressed, this time by the Communists. The Communist Party tried to replace the tradition of \"slets\" with mass exercises employed for propaganda purposes: Spartakiad (\"spartakiády\") and its organization Czechoslovak Union of Physical Education.\n\nThe Sokols reappeared briefly during the Prague Spring of 1968. After years of hibernation, the Sokol movement was revived for the fourth time in 1990. A \"slet\" was held in 1994 (with 23,000 Sokols participating), after the fall of Communism.\n\nPresently, the organization focuses on physical training in gymnastics and other athletics. Its popularity is, however, well below pre-war levels and a large percentage of members are older people with memories of the pre-1948 Sokol movement. A further \"slet\" was held in 2000 (25,000 Sokols); another was held in July 2006. In July 2012 there was celebration of 150 years of Sokol movement; \"slets\" are expected to be held every six years.\n\n\"Slets\" are also held in the United States by organizations of Czech (American Sokol Organization) and Slovak (Sokol USA) descent. The American Sokol Organization and Sokol USA alternate in hosting national \"slets\" in the United States at 4-year intervals:\n\nThe American Sokol Organization most recently hosted the XXIII ASO \"Slet\" from June 25 through June 30, 2013 in Milwaukee Wisconsin.\n\nThe American Sokol Organization will host the XXIV ASO \"Slet\" in the summer of 2017 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\nSokol USA most recently hosted the XXVI national \"slet\" from June 29 through July 2, 2011 in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nSokol USA hosted the XXVII \"slet\", commemorating the 120th anniversary of Sokol USA, from June 29 to July 2, 2016 in Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nRegional districts of the American Sokol Organization and Sokol USA also host smaller regional slets on an annual basis.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century the Sokol movement was introduced in Catalonia and soon was considered as a new tradition. It bore the name of \"falcó\" (falcon in Catalan) and was influenced by the older tradition of the castellers.\n\n\n\n"}

Their first names are not recorded anywhere and they are consistently referred to as \"Little\" and \"Tall\", their heights seemingly the only differentiating factor.\n\nTall Bennett also played for All-England teams and was prominent in the single wicket variety of the sport, which was hugely popular in the 1740s. Like his brother, he was acclaimed publicly as a great batsman. There is an article in \"The Connoisseur\" (no. 132, dated 1746) about Robert Colchin that includes: \"...but his (Colchin's) greatest excellence is cricket-playing, in which he is reckoned as good a bat as either of the Bennetts...\".\n\nThe Bennetts are first noted in 1744 when one of them (which is unknown) played for London against Slindon. In 1745, they were both in Richard Newland's XI against Long Robin's XI at the Artillery Ground in June. Later that season, \"Little\" Bennett played twice for Surrey against Addington as a given man. There is no mention of them in 1746 and then \"Little\" Bennett returns in July 1747 playing for Long Robin's XI against William Hodsoll's XI. Later that season, he plays for All-England against Kent.\n\nIn 1747 and 1748, both brothers appeared regularly in single wicket teams. A player called only Bennett took part in two matches for Surrey against All-England in June 1749. \"Little\" Bennett played for Stephen Dingate's XI against Long Robin's XI the same month. In 1752, they both played for Westminster against Addington. In 1753, \"Tall\" Bennett played against London as a given man for a Marylebone XI. \"Little\" Bennett played a single wicket game in 1754.\n\nThe last mention is in 1755 when the brothers both took part in a \"fives\" match playing for London against Windsor & Eton on Kennington Common.\n\nIn all, \"Tall\" Bennett made 10 known appearances, 7 in single wicket and 3 in significant matches. \"Little\" Bennett made 19 known appearances, 12 in single wicket and 7 in significant matches.

A standing-room only crowd of 5,021 saw Long Beach come away victorious with a final score of 71-64.\n\nThe Walter Pyramid was designed by Don Gibbs and built by the Nielson Construction Company of San Diego. The building of Walter Pyramid cost approximately $22 million. Each side of the perimeter of Walter Pyramid measures , making it a mathematically true pyramid. It is one of only three true pyramid-style buildings in the United States, the others being Luxor Las Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada and Pyramid Arena in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nThe Walter Pyramid rises 18 stories above the Long Beach skyline and its exterior is uniformly clad in sheets of dark-blue corrugated aluminum.\n\nOn March 5, 2005, Long Beach State officially renamed The Pyramid to Walter Pyramid in honor of Mike and Arline Walter. The Walters were given this recognition for a $2.1 million donation given to the university. In addition to being the vice-president of Levi Strauss & Co., Mike Walter was also a dean for Long Beach State's College of Business Administration from 1993 to 2000.\n\nThe Walter Pyramid is currently home to the Long Beach State 49ers men's basketball and Long Beach State 49ers women's basketball programs, as well as the Long Beach State 49ers men's volleyball and Long Beach State 49ers women's volleyball programs. Prior to the construction of the Walter Pyramid on campus, the men's basketball team played some of their games in the Long Beach Arena in downtown Long Beach, and at the on-campus University Gymnasium later renamed Gold Mine, which has just 1,900 seats.\n\nIn addition to being the home for Long Beach State 49ers athletics, the Walter Pyramid as hosted several NCAA-sponsored events including numerous women’s volleyball NCAA matches, the 2001 and 2003 NCAA Men’s Volleyball Championships and the 2003 NCAA Women’s Volleyball Regionals.\n\nThe Southern California Summer Pro League used the Walter Pyramid during the summer months from 1995 to 2007.

It is named for its locally based corporate sponsor Xcel Energy. With an official capacity of 17,954, the arena has four spectator levels: one suite level and three general seating levels.\n\nThe arena is owned by the city of Saint Paul and operated by Minnesota Sports & Entertainment. The building is home to the NHL's Minnesota Wild and is the former home of the NLL's Minnesota Swarm. It is on the same block as the RiverCentre convention facility, Roy Wilkins Auditorium and the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts, in downtown St. Paul. It also served as official home to the 2008 Republican National Convention.\n\nThe arena opened on September 29, 2000. It was built on the site of the demolished St. Paul Civic Center. The push for a new arena in Saint Paul grew after the National Hockey League's Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas. Saint Paul unsuccessfully courted the NHL's Hartford Whalers and Winnipeg Jets under Mayor Norm Coleman, but the Civic Center was an obstacle to both deals.\n\nIn order to get an NHL expansion team, Saint Paul needed to build a new arena. After several failed attempts to get funding, the project was funded by the state in April 1998. The state gave Saint Paul a no interest loan for $65 million of the $130 million project, though the state forgave $17 million of that loan in exchange for high school sports championships played at the arena.\n\nThe Minnesota Wild played their first game at the arena on October 11, 2000, against the Philadelphia Flyers. The game ended in a 3-3 tie. Peter White scored the first goal in the arena while Darby Hendrickson scored the first goal for the Wild. The Wild's first win at the arena came on October 18, 2000, where they defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning 6-5. It wasn't until April 14, 2003, when the Wild played in their first playoff game at the arena. In that game, the Wild suffered a 3-0 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. A week later, on April 21, 2003, the Wild won their first playoff game 3-2 on an overtime game-winner by Richard Park. \n\nIn 2004, it was named by ESPN as the best overall sports venue in the U.S. The 10 millionth person passed through the gates on July 3, 2007.\n\nThe Twin Cities were selected as the hosting metropolis for the 2008 Republican National Convention on September 27, 2006 and the arena was chosen as the main venue. The Republican National Convention was held here on September 1–4.\n\nIn 2010, a Minnesota Wild game at the 'X' was listed as the third best stadium experience in North America, according to the ESPN Magazine. First on the list went to the Minnesota Twins and Target Field.\n\nOn April 26, 2015, the Wild won their first playoff series at the arena, defeating the St. Louis Blues 4-1 in game six of the Western Conference Quarterfinals. \n\nThe arena played host to the politically motivated Vote for Change Tour on October 5, 2004, featuring performances by Bright Eyes, R.E.M. and Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band (with special guest John Fogerty and unannounced guest Neil Young).\n\nThe Minnesota Lynx of the WNBA used the Xcel Energy Center during the 2016 WNBA Playoffs, and played a full season in the arena in 2017, as their home arena, Minneapolis' Target Center, was going through renovations.\n\nThe concourse areas contain a hockey jersey from every high school in Minnesota hanging on the wall, reflecting the \"State of Hockey.\" Surrounding the arena at all four corners are \"crows nests.\" One features an organ built into the shell of a Zamboni and is played during Wild games. The second nest features a lighthouse which houses a foghorn that is blasted when the team takes the ice before games, for all Wild goals, and after a victory. The third is often used for the \"Let's play hockey!\" announcement before puck drop each game, along with game ops interviews, announcements, and fan contests. The fourth provides an additional stage for various uses.\n\nPrior to its opening, the arena installed an integrated scoring, video, information and advertising display system from Daktronics, based in Brookings, South Dakota. The system includes a large LED circular, center-hung scoreboard with multiple displays, nearly of ribbon display technology mounted on the fascia and large video displays outside the facility. The center ice display was replaced during the summer of 2014. An array of 10 LED screens with the largest measuring 37.5 feet wide by 19 feet high. In the Summer of 2015 the arena began replacing every seat in the building with cushioned seating. This project was finished by early 2016.\n\n\nIn 2014 the campus of the Xcel Energy Center, RiverCentre, and Legendary Roy Wilkins Auditorium have earned three world class certifications. \n\nThe Xcel Energy Center and RiverCentre Campus is the first complex in the world to receive all three of the above listed certifications. The road to achieving these awards has spanned several years, and could not have happened without the support of all staff members. Some of the steps taken in order to achieve these awards are:\n\nIn addition to the efforts made by staff, the Xcel Energy Center has partnered with the NHL to join Change the Course, a national initiative promoting water conservation and restoration. In order to highlight the incredible achievements the X has earned, they have produced: Exceptionally Green: Minnesota Wild, Saint Paul RiverCentre and Xcel Energy Center\n\n2000s\n\n\n\nIn 1998, the state made a $65 million interest-free loan toward construction of the $130 million arena, $17 million of which was forgiven when the team agreed to allow amateur and public events. That left a loan of $48 million.\n\nIn 2013 the Minnesota State Legislature passed an omnibus jobs, housing and commerce bill that included forgiveness of the remaining $32.7 million loan for Xcel Energy Center.\n\nUnder the terms of the forgiveness deal in this bill, St. Paul's annual loan payment will be reduced by $500,000 in 2014 and again in 2015. The balance of the loan will be forgiven in 2016. The city still owes $56.8 million in bonds on the arena, of the $72.7 million it borrowed in 1998.\n\n"}
