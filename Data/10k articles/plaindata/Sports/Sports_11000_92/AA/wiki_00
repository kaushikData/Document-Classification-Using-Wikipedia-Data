{"id": "44143107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44143107", "title": "1870 Victorian football season", "text": "1870 Victorian football season\n\nThe 1870 Victorian football season was an Australian rules football competition played during the winter of 1870, consisting of matches between metropolitan football clubs in Melbourne in the colony of Victoria. The premier club was .\n\nBy convention, the 1870 season is considered the first season of senior football competition in Victoria's history, or at least the first for which a premiership can be officially allocated. The reasons for this are somewhat arbitrary, since the competing clubs, organizational structure of football, and standard of play in 1870 were not materially different from 1869. \n\nThe view of 1870 as being the inaugural premiership has existed since at least 1889, when \"The Argus\" newspaper first published a table of historical premiers and second and third place-getters dating back to 1870 and no earlier. In the article which adjoined the publication of the 1889 table, the reporter commented that the haphazard nature of scheduling, frequency of cancelled matches, and overall lesser standard of play made it difficult to assign a premiership to the seasons during the 1860s. \n\nThe VFL's official publication, the \"Football Record\", also showed this same list from its inception in 1912 until 1918. In 1919, this was replaced with a new table that showed club placings since 1897, and two supplementary tables showing cumulated placings for the periods 1897 to 1918 and 1870 to 1918. These supplementary tables remained in the Record until 1923, but were omitted from the 1924 editions of the Record, and did not reappear after that. \n\nSince June 2016, the AFL Commission has formally recognised the top level of Victorian football back to 1870 as senior, which applies to both the unaffiliated period from 1870–1876 and the Victorian Football Association from 1877–1896. However, it maintains a distinction between the 1870–1896 competitions and the history of the VFL/AFL from 1897 onwards, and requires statistics and achievements from those two periods to be delineated; at the same time, the Commission allowed clubs to recognise these achievements in their own histories. \n\nFive clubs participated in senior football during the 1870 season: Albert-park, , Hobson's Bay Railway, and South Yarra. They competed in specific matches for the Challenge Cup, and a premier team was selected based on all matches during the season, including Challenge Cup matches.\n\nIn 1870, the South Yarra Football Club purchased and put up a new trophy, known as the Challenge Cup (or sometimes as the South Yarra Presentation Challenge Cup, to differentiate it from other challenge cups donated by different organisations), for competition. South Yarra was the permanent holder of the previous Challenge Cup, and decided it would be appropriate to provide a new trophy for competition. The rules relating to the presentation of the new Challenge Cup were as follows:\nOther stipulations relating to Challenge Cup games were that they were required to be controlled by central umpires, rather than by the team captains, and that no player was allowed to play for more than one club in Challenge Cup games during the year.\n\nAlbert-park took possession of the Cup in the first game against South Yarra, and never relinquished it. However, the fate of the Cup became controversial when Hobson's Bay Railway forfeited its 11 June match against Albert-park due to lack of players. Railway declined to play when only fourteen of its selected twenty turned up on the day of the game, and Albert-park took to the field and scored two goals against no opposition as a walk-over formality. Albert-park claimed the walk-over as its second Cup victory, and consequently claimed permanent possession of the Cup with its fourth win of the year on 20 August, but South Yarra, as cup donors, and several other clubs argued that the walk-over should have counted as a cancelled match rather than an Albert-park victory, and that another win was needed to claim permanent ownership of the Cup. Albert-park argued that enough procedural requirements, such as the appointment of umpires and the pre-game coin toss, had been carried out for the game to be considered official – Railway denied that these procedures had been carried out – and Albert-park argued that it was entitled to claim victory because Railway had declined the options of playing short or fielding other club officials or members who were present. Albert-park's position in claiming victory on a technicality was considered to be against the spirit of competition. There was no specific rule regarding walk-overs written into the rules which could be used to resolve the dispute.\n\nUltimately, the dispute was unresolved. There was no central body which could make a binding ruling on whether or not the walk-over counted as a victory, and neither side conceded its opponent's point. Albert-park played only one further game for the season, a draw against , but it refused to put the Cup up for contest in the match. It is also noted that Albert-park was denied the chance to become the undisputed permanent holder of the Cup on 6 August, when its return match with the weak Railway club was cancelled due to inclement weather.\n\nAlbert-park ultimately gave the Cup back to South Yarra at the end of the year, but maintained its position that it had won the Cup outright and was donating it in its capacity as the Cup's owner. South Yarra maintained its position that Albert-park had not won the Cup, and had forfeited its position as incumbent holder.\n\nThe following table lists the final results of all Challenge Cup games.\n\nAlthough it had claimed the Challenge Cup and was undefeated during the season, Albert-park was not recognised as the premier team of the 1870 season: instead, , which was also undefeated, was named as the premier. Melbourne had recorded more wins than Albert-park during the year and had played four games against for two wins and two draws, while Albert-park's three matches against Carlton had been drawn and their on-field wins had come against the weak South Yarra club, giving Melbourne a better claim to the premier position.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Albert-park's claim to the Challenge Cup was helped in large part by the fact that it was the first team to play against South Yarra during the year. Had South Yarra played its first game against Melbourne, Melbourne would have been in a strong position to win the Challenge Cup as well as the premiership.\n\nThe following table shows the five clubs' senior results during the year: all matches played amongst the five Challenge Cup teams, plus matches that Melbourne played against the Police and against the 18th Royal Irish Regiment. Albert-park's disputed walk-over victory against Railway is not included in the table.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45617006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45617006", "title": "50+1 rule", "text": "50+1 rule\n\nThe 50+1 rule (German: \"50+1-Regel\") is an informal term used to refer to a clause in the regulations of the Deutsche Fußball-Liga. The clause states that, in order to obtain a license to compete in the Bundesliga, a club must hold a majority of its own voting rights. The rule is designed to ensure that the club's members retain overall control, protecting clubs from the influence of external investors.\n\nPrior to 1998, football clubs in Germany were owned exclusively by members' associations. This meant that clubs were run as not-for-profit organisations, and private ownership was not allowed under any circumstances. This changed following a ruling by the German Football Association (DFB) in October 1998, which allowed clubs to convert their football teams into public or private limited companies. However, the \"50+1 rule\" requires the parent club to own at least 50% plus one additional share of the football company, ensuring that the club's members still hold a majority of voting rights.\n\nIn cases where a person or company has substantially funded a club for a continuous period of 20 years, it is possible for that person or company to own a controlling stake in the club. This exception most notably applies to Bayer 04 Leverkusen (owned by pharmaceuticals company Bayer), and VfL Wolfsburg (owned by automobile manufacturer Volkswagen), and has more recently allowed SAP co-founder Dietmar Hopp to gain control of his former youth club of 1899 Hoffenheim.\n\nThe rule has been criticised on a number of occasions. One of the rule's most vocal opponents is Hannover 96 president Martin Kind, who argued that the rule could be in breach of EU competition law. In 2009, Hannover put forward a motion to change the 50+1 rule, but this was overwhelmingly rejected, with 32 out of 36 clubs voting against the proposal.\n\nThe effectiveness of the rule has also been brought into question following the rise of RB Leipzig. Although it is theoretically possible to become a voting member here, RB Leipzig reserves the right to reject any membership application without citing a reason. As a result, RB Leipzig has only a handful of members, most of whom are Red Bull GmbH employees. Critics have also noted that the annual membership fee is relatively expensive compared to other clubs.\n\n"}

{"id": "4149944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4149944", "title": "Beach Soccer Worldwide", "text": "Beach Soccer Worldwide\n\nBeach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW) is the organisation responsible for the founding and growth of association football's derivative sport of beach soccer. The founding partners of BSWW codified the rules of beach soccer in 1992, with BSWW as it is known today having been officially founded in 2001 as a singular institution to develop the sport and organise international beach soccer competitions across the globe, primarily between national teams. The company is recognised as playing the biggest role in helping to establish the rules of beach soccer, to spread and evolve the sport around the world as cited by FIFA who took on governing body status of the sport from BSWW in 2005. Having established the sport's key regulations, FIFA acknowledged BSWW's framework, making their rules the official laws of beach soccer and now controls them and any modifications.\n\nToday, under the recognition of FIFA, BSWW continues to be main organisation that organises beach soccer tournaments and development (with FIFA's assistance) around the world, mainly in Europe, including the Euro Beach Soccer League, BSWW exhibition tour events and others, having involved over 110 national teams in the sport, as well as newly founded club competitions. Its founders also established the Beach Soccer World Championships; BSWW created a partnership with FIFA, \"FIFA Beach Soccer S.L.\", in 2005 to manage the tournament as the newly named FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, the only major international beach soccer tournament that BSWW does not have a hand in organising but which is all the management of FIFA.\n\nMembers of the organisation serve on FIFA's Beach Soccer Committee.\n\nBSWW's routes are traced back to 1992 with the establishment of the official rules of the sport by Giancarlo Signorini, the founding partner of \"Beach Soccer Company (BSC)\". In 1992, Signorini staged a pilot event in Los Angeles in order to test out and perfect these rules which remain very similar today. In July 1993, with the aid of his own company, BSI, Signorini organised the first professional beach soccer event, held on Miami Beach, Florida. A keen interest was taken by Brazilian sports marketing agency, Koch Tavares, who replicated the event in 1994 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Viking Graham Sports Group, a Philadelphia based investment group, acquired BSI's rights to stage professional beach soccer events, forming a partnership with Signorini to create \"Beach Soccer Company\".\n\nKoch Tavares and BSC went on to be the main two entities involved in promoting beach soccer for the rest of the 1990s, with the former responsible for organising the \"Beach Soccer World Championships\" beginning in 1995, and the latter establishing the \"Pro Beach Soccer Tour\" in 1996, a series of worldwide professional exhibition tournaments to promote the sport, and the \"European Pro Beach Soccer League\" in 1998, all contested between national teams as opposed to clubs. BSC relocated to Monaco in 1998 and again to Barcelona in 1999, renaming to become \"Pro Beach Soccer, S.L. (PBS)\" in 2000 to reflect the branding of their established events.\n\nIn 2001, the entity of Koch Tavares responsible for beach soccer and PBS came together to create one single company in order to streamline development of the sport under one unifying company, as opposed to multiple parties involved trying to synchronise progress between one another, officially forming Beach Soccer Worldwide, opting to remain based in Barcelona. BSWW took on roles of organising all major competitions of the preceding companies including the Pro Beach Soccer Tour and European Pro Beach Soccer League, whilst supervising the World Championships and the newly created America's League, all remaining focused on national teams. This was also done to make it easier to bring on board sponsors, coordinate media coverage and present the football alternative to FIFA under a clearly defined, all-encompassing, representative body for beach soccer.\n\nBSWW's attention immediately turned to FIFA. Beach Soccer Company had already ensured all tournaments from 2000 onwards were played under FIFA's fair play rules and delegates from both parties met multiple times to discuss for BSWW's rules of the sport and competitions to gain recognition and backing of football's governing body. By 2002, FIFA had come to an agreement with BSWW to adopt the rules and regulations that had been established over the previous decade, with some minor changes to ensure FIFA's interest in key components of regular football were respected and acknowledging key major tournaments in the sport including the World Championships. During this time, BSWW also brought on board major sponsors such as MasterCard, McDonald's and Coca-Cola for certain time period.\n\nThe involvement with FIFA was furthered in 2004 when \"FIFA Beach Soccer S.L.\" was established in agreement and partnership with BSWW, to take over responsibility of the World Championships, being beach soccer's primary tournament, to become an official FIFA competition. The newly named \"FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup\" would start in 2005, with BSWW staff acting as advisers. It was also agreed that FIFA would become the sport's governing body, taking over from BSWW.\n\nHowever at this time FIFA also recognised BSWW as the main entity behind past and more importantly continuing promotion and development of the sport elsewhere besides the new World Cup, and so BSWW retained the organisation responsibilities and control of other beach soccer championships like the EBSL, with FIFA only taking full control of the World Cup. So much so that after the first successful World Cup in 2005, when FIFA established World Cup qualifying tournaments to promote the sport across all confederations to start in 2006, all responsibility was handed to BSWW to organise and execute such events, with FIFA only supervising.\n\nSince then, BSWW has continued to develop the sport worldwide, now aided greatly with FIFA's beach soccer training courses and refereeing. The Euro Beach Soccer League (dropping the \"pro\" from the title in 2004 as it was no longer reflecting of the company name) has remained BSWW's main asset, gathering up to 27 nations to compete in recent editions compared to just 7 in the first event in 1998 in a summer-long event. The Pro Beach Soccer Tour has also been renamed to the BSWW Tour for the same reasons, continuing exhibition events to promote the sport as far wide and remote as Réunion and Cape Verde with around 10 tour events a year. BSWW has continued organising the World Cup qualifiers, as well as establishing new regular international competitions such as the Intercontinental Cup (similar to the FIFA Confederations Cup) since 2011 and generating more interest from big sponsors like Samsung and Huawei.\n\nBSWW representatives, in partnership with FIFA, have liaised with the International Olympic Committee a number of times, with Olympic-affiliated events such as the Asian Beach Games integrating beach soccer from 2008 onward, the South American Beach Games from 2009 and the European Games starting from 2015. The ultimate aim is to have beach soccer a sport in the summer Olympics. But despite a campaign for inclusion in the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Olympics., the sport was ultimately not included and so lobbying in cooperation with FIFA continues, to ultimately fulfil the goal of making beach soccer an Olympic sport. In 2017, BSWW secured beach soccer as a sport at the inaugural Olympic-affiliated World Beach Games in 2019 and hope to use its inclusion as a springboard for future absorption into the Summer Olympics.\n\nMore recently, a greater involvement from certain confederations in organising World Cup qualifying championships has eased the full involvement of BSWW, allowing the federation to promote the club side of the game more, establishing the Mundialito de Clubs (Club World Cup) in 2011 and the Euro Winners Cup (similar to the UEFA Champions League) in 2013.\n\nDevelopment of the women's game has also become a target for BSWW, with the first official game between Switzerland and Germany in 2009, promoting further international exhibition tournaments and friendlies involving nations such as England, Italy and the Czech Republic, with the Euro Winners Cup having a 16-club women's version for the first time in 2016 and the first Women's Euro Beach Soccer Cup also taking place in 2016.\n\nBSWW has organised and delivered over 200 international events in more than 50 countries worldwide, involving over 110 nations from all confederations, assembling an audience of over 250 million households in 180 countries. Vice-president Joan Cuscó continues to serve on FIFA's Beach Soccer committee as BSWW's representative. In 2017, BSWW and FIFA agreed to extend their partnership until at least 2024.\n\nBSWW established a ranking system for European teams in the mid-2000s as the majority of tournaments are held in Europe and it is the most active continent for national teams. Hence the ranking was used for seeding in competitions like the EBSL. However, in 2014, BSWW created the first world ranking table based on a similar system to FIFA's world ranking for association football national teams.\n\nGlobal Partners:\nSuppliers:\n\nBSWW organises and has an input in many different competitions; the following are regular events that are ongoing:\n\nAdvisory role:\nConsiderable input, with involvement from confederations, under the supervision of FIFA:\nFull input:\nAffiliation only:\n\nIt has been standard practice for BSWW to award prizes to the top scorer, MVP and best goalkeeper at the conclusion every event of their organisation. However, in 2014, BSWW took this concept of awards to a new level, establishing beach soccer's first annual end of season awards ceremony, taking place during November in Dubai. The ceremony, a gala event attended by many of the world's leading figures in the sport, celebrates the achievements of top performers worldwide over the course of the season and has been compared to FIFA's The Best awards and the Ballon D'or in association football, in both importance, grandeur and equivalence for the those involved in beach soccer.\n\nSome of the many prizes awarded on the night include best player of the year, best coach of the year, best goal and best team.\n\nBeach Soccer Worldwide extends its commitment beyond purely sport development. In 2009, the Beach Soccer Foundation was created by BSWW to tackle three main issues surrounding the sport:\n\n\n"}

The film takes place in a dystopian American society in the year 2000, where the murderous Transcontinental Road Race has become a form of national entertainment. The screenplay is based on the short story \"The Racer\" by Ib Melchior.\n\nAfter the \"World Crash of '79\", massive civil unrest and economic ruin occurs. The United States government restructured into a totalitarian regime under martial law. To pacify the population, the government has organized the Transcontinental Road Race, where a group of drivers race across the country in their high-powered cars, infamous for violence, gore, and innocent pedestrians being struck for bonus points.\n\nIn the year 2000, the five drivers in the 20th annual race, who all adhere to professional wrestling-style personas and drive appropriately themed cars, include \"Frankenstein\", the mysterious black-garbed champion and national hero; \"Machine Gun Joe\", a Chicago tough-guy gangster; \"Calamity Jane\", a cowgirl; \"Matilda the Hun\", a neo-Nazi; and \"Nero the Hero\", a Roman gladiator. Each drives with a navigator of the opposite sex, who also implicitly functions as a love interest. The race is covered on national TV by a news team headed by the boisterous and comical Junior Bruce, seductive matron Grace Pander, and laconic commentator Harold (a parody of Howard Cosell). The game has sadistic rules, where killing babies and physically challenged people will give the player extra points. Machine Gun Joe is the main opposition to Frankenstein.\nA resistance group led by Thomasina Paine, a descendant of 1770s American Revolutionary Thomas Paine, plans to rebel against Mr. President's regime by sabotaging the race, killing most of the drivers, and taking Frankenstein hostage as leverage against the President. The group is assisted by Paine's great-granddaughter Annie, Frankenstein's latest navigator. She plans to lure him into an ambush to be replaced by a double. Despite a pirated national broadcast made by Ms. Paine herself, the resistance's disruption of the race is covered up by the government and instead blamed on the French, who are also blamed for ruining the country's economy and telephone system.\n\nAt first, the Resistance's plan works. Nero is killed when he runs over a booby-trapped doll planted by the Resistance, which he mistakes for a real baby and proceeds to run it over to gain points. Matilda drives off a cliff while following a fake detour set up by the Resistance. Calamity Jane, who witnessed Matilda's death, inadvertently drives over a land mine trying to leave the area. This leaves only Frankenstein and Machine Gun Joe in the race.\n\nAs Frankenstein nonchalantly survives every attempt made on his life during the race, Annie comes to discover that the Frankenstein she knows is anything but a willing government stooge, nor is he the original man. The current Frankenstein is, in fact, one of a number of random wards of the state trained exclusively to race in the identity. \"When one is used up, they bring in another\", he tells Annie. The current Frankenstein also reveals that he has his own plans: when he wins the race and shakes hands with Mr. President, he will detonate a grenade which has been implanted in his prosthetic right hand (he calls it his \"hand grenade\"), which he has kept concealed by keeping his glove on at all times (even while undressed). His plan goes awry, however, when Machine Gun Joe attacks and Annie kills him using Frankenstein's \"hand\" grenade.\n\nHaving successfully outmaneuvered both the rival drivers and the Resistance, Frankenstein is declared the winner, although he is wounded and unable to carry out his original grenade attack plan. Annie instead dons Frankenstein's disguise and plans to stab Mr. President while standing in for him on the podium. As the president congratulates \"Frankenstein\" for his victory, in the process declaring war on the French and appointing Frankenstein leader of the war, Annie is mistakenly shot and wounded by her own grandmother, who is desperate for revenge against Frankenstein for having supposedly killed her during the race (he had actually just drugged her). The real Frankenstein takes advantage of the confusion and rams the President's stage with his car, finally fulfilling his lifelong desire to kill him.\n\nIn the epilogue, Annie and Frankenstein marry. Frankenstein, now President, abolishes the race and plans to rebuild the country. However, Junior Bruce starts to protest against it. When unable to find a moral reason to continue the race and desperate to have the race perpetuate, he starts shouting that it is a way of life, to keep America satisfied, to entertain and give the people what they want. Frankenstein, annoyed, runs him over with his car and drives off with Annie to the cheers and applause of the crowd.\n\n\nRoger Corman wanted to make a futuristic action sports film to take advantage of the advance publicity of \"Rollerball\" (1975). He optioned a short story by Ib Melchior and hired Robert Thom to adapt it. Director Paul Bartel felt this was unshootable, so Charles B. Griffith rewrote it. Corman wanted Peter Fonda to play the lead, but he was unavailable, so David Carradine was cast instead. Carradine was paid 10% of the film's gross — he and Ron Howard were the only stars of Roger Corman Productions to ever get a percentage of the gross.\n\nBartel later recalled \"We had terrible script problems; David had to finish his 'Kung Fu' series before starting and we had bad weather. We all worked under terrible pressure. Roger and I had an essential disagreement over comedy. He took out a lot of the comedy scenes. He may have been right and was probably more objective.\"\n\nBartel later said, \"Most of my guilty pleasures in this film were ripped out by the roots by Roger Corman before the film ever saw the light of day and substituted with crushed heads and blood squibs. Nevertheless, there is a joke about the French wrecking our economy and telephone system that I still find amusing. And I am pleased by the scene introducing the Girl Fan (played very effectively by my sister Wendy) who is to sacrifice herself beneath the wheels of David Carradine's race car and wants to meet him so that the gesture will have \"meaning\".\"\n\nAccording to \"Variety\" the film earned $4.8 million in rentals in the United States.\n\nContemporary reviews were mixed. Lawrence Van Gelder of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film had \"nothing to say beyond the superficial about government or rebellion. And in the absence of such a statement, it becomes what it seems to have mocked—a spectacle glorifying the car as an instrument of violence.\" \"Variety\" called the film \"cartoonish but effective entertainment, with some good action sequences and plenty of black humor.\" Richard Combs of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote that the comic conceits were \"too shaky to hold the movie together and tend to self-destruct some distance short of any pop allegory for America.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film one star out of four and wrote that it \"may be the goofiest and sleaziest film I've seen in the last five years.\" Tom Shales of \"The Washington Post\" praised the film as \"one of the zippier little B pictures of the year,\" adding that \"it is designed primarily as a spectacle of kinetic titillation, and on that level, it's a foregone smash hit.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" was also positive, calling it \"a fine little action picture with big ideas\" and finding Carradine \"terrific\" in his role.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film zero stars in his review, deriding its violence and lamenting its appeal to small children. However, during a review of \"The Fast and the Furious\" on \"Ebert & Roeper and the Movies\", Ebert named \"Death Race 2000\" as part of a \"great tradition of summer drive-in movies\" that embrace a \"summer exploitation mentality in a clever way\". Nevertheless, Ebert would go on to defend his original rating of zero stars in subsequent posts on his Movie Answers Man blog.\n\nThe film has garnered critical acclaim over the years, having a score of 83% on the film critics site, Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10, deeming it \"fresh\". The sites' critical consensus states, \"\"Death Race 2000\" is a fun, campy classic, drawing genuine thrills from its mindless ultra-violence.\"\n\nThe film has long been regarded as a cult hit, and was often viewed as superior to \"Rollerball\", a much more expensive major studio drama released later in the same year; another dystopian science-fiction sports film similarly focusing on the use of dangerous sports as an \"opiate\".\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nShout! Factory released a Deluxe Edition DVD and Blu-ray on June 22, 2010 in region 1/A.\n\nPrevious editions were released on DVD and VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment and New Concorde, among others.\n\nA comic book sequel titled \"Death Race 2020\" was published in 1995 by Roger Corman's short-lived \"Roger Corman's Cosmic Comics\" imprint. It was written by Pat Mills of \"2000 AD\" fame, with art by Kevin O'Neill. The pair had already worked together on several comics, including \"Marshal Law\". The comic book, as the title indicates, took place 20 years after the film ended and dealt with Frankenstein's return to the race. New racer characters introduced included Von Dutch, the Alcoholic, Happy the Clown, Steppenwolf, Rick Rhesus and Harry Carrie.\n\nThe comic book series lasted eight issues before being cancelled.\n\nPaul W. S. Anderson directed a remake entitled \"Death Race\", which was released August 22, 2008, starring Jason Statham. The remake began production in late August 2007. Besides Statham, this new version also stars Ian McShane, Joan Allen, and Tyrese Gibson. It also includes a cameo (by voice-over) of David Carradine reprising his role as Frankenstein. Two direct-to-DVD prequels titled \"Death Race 2\" (2011) and \"\" (2013) starring Luke Goss, Tanit Phoenix, Danny Trejo and Ving Rhames and a direct-to-DVD sequel titled \"\" (2018) were also produced.\n\nAn official film sequel to the original film, \"Death Race 2050\" was produced by Roger Corman and released in early 2017.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He began his league football career with Najip FC in 2014, a team that lost every game in their previous season. Coached by the late Johari Bungsu, Hanif achieved a third-place finish with Najip FC in the 2014 Brunei Super League and also reached the final of the FA Cup that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final along the way.\n\nBrunei's football association NFABD created Tabuan Muda in 2015, a league team that serves to prepare for international tournaments, mirroring Singapore's Young Lions and Malaysia's Harimau Muda teams. Hanif was assigned to the Under-18s playing in the Brunei Premier League at the start of the season, however he was promoted to the Brunei Super League team in the second half of the season.

It was primarily used for baseball and was the home of Buffalo Bisons of the International League. The ballpark had a capacity of 14,000 people and opened in 1924. It was located on the block bounded by East Ferry Street (north, third base), Masten Avenue (east, left field), Woodlawn Avenue (south, right field) and Michigan Avenue (west, first base).\n\nThe site on the corner of East Ferry and Michigan Avenue had been in use as a baseball venue since 1889. Buffalo Baseball Park was constructed on the site in that year, replacing Olympic Park as the Bisons' home ballpark. The wooden stands served as the Bisons' home stadium through the 1923 season. For 1924, a new steel-and-concrete structure was built on the site. It was initially called Bison Stadium, and was renamed in memory of owner Frank J. Offermann following his death.\n\nAccording to one source, this park was the site of the first high-minor league night game, on July 3, 1930, a year in which many minor league teams resorted to lights during the heat of summer as a means of boosting attendance as the Great Depression began to take effect (the majors would not begin using lights until 1935).\n\nThe ballpark had fairly cozy dimensions. It was on a rectangular block, with the diamond tilted somewhat counterclockwise relative to the streets. Left field was 321 feet, left center 345, center 400, right center 365, right field line 297. Also, it was reportedly only 33 feet to the backstop. This added up to a hitters park, and several sluggers took advantage, especially Luke Easter, who in the mid-1950s led the International League in home runs despite being over 40 years old. Earlier, in May 1938, the much-traveled Bob \"Suitcase\" Seeds had hit 7 home runs in two days here.\n\nThe ballpark went out with a bang and a whimper in 1960, its final season, as the Bisons made it to the Junior World Series but lost the final game, at home. The next year, they moved about ten blocks straight south on Masten to take up shop at War Memorial Stadium.\n\nThus the \"permanent\" version of the ballpark lasted 36 seasons, whereas the \"temporary\" wooden version had survived for 35. The stadium was eventually demolished and in 1962, Woodlawn Junior High School (eventually renamed Buffalo Traditional School) opened on the site's grounds. In 2008, the site became the new home of the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts. In August 2012, a historical plaque was dedicated at the site in remembrance of over 72 years of baseball played on the grounds. Local Buffalo sports historian John Boutet spearheaded the project and raised the funds through the Facebook group Buffalo Sports Museum, the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and the Buffalo Bisons.\n\n"}

It is one of the three main venues within the Scottish Event Campus. \n\nSince the opening of the original buildings in 1985, the complex has undergone two major expansions; the first being the SEC Armadillo in 1997, and then the SSE Hydro in 2013. The venue's holding company SEC Limited, is 91% owned by Glasgow City Council and 9% owned by private investors. It is probably best known for hosting concerts, particularly in Hall 4 and Hall 3.\n\nThe Scottish Development Agency first supported the construction of an exhibition centre in Glasgow in 1979. A site at the former Queen's Dock on the north bank of the Clyde at Finnieston, which had closed to navigation in 1969, was selected. Land reclamation works started in 1982 using rubble from the demolished St Enoch railway station. The construction of the SECC buildings began on the site in 1983.\n\nThe Main Building was completed and opened in 1985, with a concert by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra in Hall 1. It later held the Grand International Show in Hall 4 as part of the 1988 Glasgow Garden Festival. In 1990, the SECC was one of the hubs of Glasgow's year as European City of Culture, hosting concerts by Luciano Pavarotti, the Bolshoi Ballet and Opera and Bryan Adams.\n\nUpon its opening, the Centre quickly gained its nickname from the local press and thus to general usage, \"The Big Red Shed\", owing to its outward appearance, which resembled a giant red painted warehouse. The nickname became redundant after the Main Building was painted grey in 1997.\n\nThe SECC occupies 64 acres (260,000 m) of land – most of which is surface car parking space – and hosts numerous music concerts, exhibitions and professional conferences. The SECC also has its own railway station, Exhibition Centre, on the Argyle Line of Glasgow's suburban railway network. The 16-storey Forum Hotel (now part of the Crowne Plaza chain) was opened on the site in 1989. \n\nIn September 1996, a new 5,095 m exhibition hall, Hall 3, was opened. In May 1997, the conversion of Hall 1 into the Loch Suite conference venue was completed.\n\nIn 1995, construction began on a new building – the SEC Armadillo – to become part of the SECC complex. Designed by award-winning architect Sir Norman Foster and often called \"the armadillo\" by Glaswegians, this new 3,000 capacity building was completed in 1997.\n\nIn April 2004, the owners SEC Ltd again commissioned Foster and Partners to design a £562 million regeneration of the Queen's Dock area, under the name QD2 – so called as this is the second regeneration of the former Queen's Dock area since the centre's inception. \n\nThis project incorporated SSE Hydro, a 12,500 seat, £50 million concert arena for the SECC, which opened in September 2013. The centre is also to be served by the Clyde FastLink. The surface carparks to the West of the site will be sold for residential development and land to the east has also been identified for commercial development.\n\nThe venue hosted the Eurovision Dance Contest 2008. The SECC hosted the Girls' Day Out Show in 2009, 2010 and 2012. It staged The Scottish Golf Show in 2009 and 2010.\n\nThe venue annually stages the popular BBC Good Food Show. \n\nOn 15 November 2016, it played host to Insane Championship Wrestling's biggest show of the year, \"Fear & Loathing VIII\", the company's biggest sold out show to date. It also was the biggest selling show in British wrestling history since Big Daddy fought Giant Haystacks at Wembley Arena in 1981.\n\nThe SECC hosted the World Science Fiction convention twice, as Intersection, the 53rd World Science Fiction convention in 1995, and Interaction, the 63rd World Science Fiction Convention in 2005 (including the SEC Armadillo).\n\nIrish pop band Westlife were honored at this venue with four specially commissioned bar stools which will be a permanent fixture at the venue. This marks an amazing 49 performances at SECC where they entertained over 380,000 fans over the years selling more tickets than any other act.\n\n"}
{"id": "5674184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5674184", "title": "Segway polo", "text": "Segway polo\n\nSegway polo is a team sport which started to gain some measure of popularity after being played by members of the Bay Area Segway Enthusiasts Group (Bay Area SEG) in 2004. The Bay Area SEG was not the first to play polo on a Segway HT; a team sponsored by Mobile Entertainment played in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome at a Minnesota Vikings halftime show in 2003 although the Bay Area SEG members were not aware of this match at the time they first played the sport. Segway polo was developed as it is played today by the members of the Bay Area SEG and other groups and teams that have joined subsequently.\n\nSegway polo is similar to horse polo, except that instead of playing on horseback, each player rides a Segway PT on the field. The rules have been adapted from bicycle polo and horse polo. Two teams of five players each hit a ball with their mallets, trying to get the ball into the other team's goal. The regulation field size is 200 feet (61 meters) by 128 feet (39 meters), and the goal is 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide by 5 feet (1.5 meters) high. A regulation match consists of four 8 minute quarters, known in polo as \"chukkers.\" The ball can be struck with the mallet or any part of a player’s body or Segway but may only be directed using the mallet. A goal can not be scored off of any part of a player’s body or Segway unless it occurs accidentally.\n\nAlthough not a major sport, Segway polo is gaining popularity and teams have begun forming in the United States, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Barbados, Lebanon, the United Kingdom, Holland and Spain among others. The International Segway Polo Association (ISPA) has been established as the official governing body for Segway Polo.\n\nThe Segway Polo world championship is the Woz Challenge Cup. It is named after Steve \"Woz\" Wozniak, cofounder of Apple Inc., and a player of Segway Polo.\n\nThe Woz Cup was established in 2006 when the Silicon Valley Aftershocks played the New Zealand Pole Blacks in Auckland, New Zealand. The result was a 2–2 tie.\n\nIn 2007, it was played in San Francisco, California, with the Aftershocks defeating the Pole Blacks 5–0.\n\nThe 2008 Woz Cup was played in Indianapolis, coincident with Segwayfest 2008. The California Gold Rush defeated the Silicon Valley Aftershocks for the championship by a score of 3–2. The Funky-Move Turtles (Germany) placed third and the Polo Bears (California) placed fourth.\n\nThe 2009 Woz Cup was played in Cologne, Germany. The Flyin' Fish from Barbados took first place, beating the Silicon Valley Aftershocks 2–0. Steve Wozniak co-founder of Apple Computers, was there to play and present the cup; Victor Miller, who wrote the script for \"Friday the 13th\", was also on the Aftershocks team. The Flyin' Fish have been playing Segway polo for only four months and dominated the other teams hailing from the United States, Germany and Austria.\n\nThe 2010 Woz Cup was played at the Lion Castle Polo Estate in Barbados. Once again, the Barbados Flyin' Fish won, this time beating the Germany Blade Pirates 3-1. A total of eight teams participated, including two teams from Barbados, two teams from Germany, one team from Sweden and three teams from California.\n\nThe 2011 Woz Cup was hosted by the Folsom Breakout and played in Folsom, California from June 16 to 19, 2011. There were a record 12 teams competing. The Germany Blade Pirates avenged their previous year's loss against the Flyin' Fish and beat them in the championship match by a score of 1–0.
