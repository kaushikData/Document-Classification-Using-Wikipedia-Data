{"id": "2311165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2311165", "title": "Ball badminton", "text": "Ball badminton\n\nBall badminton is a sport native to India. It is a racket game, played with a yellow ball made of wool, on a court of fixed dimensions (12 by 24 metres) divided by a net. The game was played as early as 1856 by the royal family in Tanjore, the capital of Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu, India. It enjoys the greatest popularity in India. Ball badminton is a fast-paced game; it demands skill, quick reflexes, good judgment, agility, and the ability to control the ball with one's wrist.\n\nGames are usually played outdoors during the day. As a result, weather conditions wield a considerable influence, and ball badminton's rules allow the effects of weather conditions to be distributed more-or-less evenly between both teams. More recently, indoor versions of the game have been played under artificial lighting. All-India tournaments are conducted regularly using floodlights in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. Ball Badminton sport is managed by \" Ball Badminton Federation of India\" Now Ball badminton game is officially recognised game in India. Total 34 units are affiliated to \"Ball badminton federation of india \" in which 26 are States units including Bihar, jharkhand, Nagaland etc 5 Public sector units and 3 provisional affiliated units.\n\nBall badminton originated in Tanjore, in Tamil Nadu. It became popular, commanding the interest of the Maharaja of Tanjore. The game has attracted many players from southern India.\n\nPreviously, ball badminton was an attractive game for rural boys since it required a minimum of equipment. The game drew a large number of students from South India, resulting in the formation of the Ball Badminton Federation of India in 1954. The BBF was among the first three sports federations—along with the Indian Athletic Federation and the Indian Hockey Federation—to form the Indian Olympic Association in 1961. Ball badminton eventually spread to Andhra Pradesh, and the first national championship was conducted at Hyderabad in 1956. It was later introduced at the junior and sub-junior levels.\n\nTypes of incumbent\nThe ball is yellow wool, from 27 to 30 grams in weight and from 5 to 5.5 cm in diameter. A standard ball-badminton racket usually weighs from 165 to 185 grams and is 63 to 70 cm in length. \nThe strung oval area of the racket should be 20 to 22 across and 24 to 27 cm in length. \nThe net is made of fine cord to make a 2 cm square mesh along its length and is edged with red tape at the top. \nThe entire net is red, white and blue, 100 cm wide and 13.5 metres in length. It is tied to a centre pole of 183 cm and two poles of 185 cm at the sides of the court to maintain the 183 cm height of the net at the centre. \nTwo posts, each 180 cm high, are fixed one metre outside the court on either side at the end of the line to which the net is tied, strong enough to keep the net well stretched. A hook is fixed at 1.5 metres height to each pole to easily tighten the net whenever necessary.\nThe size of the court for \"fives\" teams is 12 metres wide and 24 metres long. It is divided across the middle by a net line over which the net is hung, the ends of which are attached to the tops of the two posts. The serving crease lines are drawn one metre away from each side of the net line and parallel to it. \nThe centre line is drawn halfway between the serving crease lines and parallel to the sidelines; this divides the space on each side of the crease line into two halves, known as the right and left courts. \nThe boundary lines are marked with white tape, 10 mm thick. The centre and crease lines are to be marked so as to be visible, about 10 mm wide\n\nBall badminton is a team sport. The ball is served (hit from the right or left court of one side to the diagonally opposite court of the other side). The server begins on the right court and moves to the left court each time a point is scored. The ball may be returned by any opposing player. \nAfter the first 9th, 18th, and 27nd point the teams change positions, with the server continuing to alternate between the right and left courts. \nThe ball is served underhand below the waist, then it must go over the net and beyond the serving crease line on the other side. An overhand service—if the ball is above the server's waist when it is struck—is a fault. The ball must be returned before it touches the ground, and no player may strike the ball twice in succession. \nThe server must not serve until the other side is ready; ordinarily, the players of the receiving side are expected to be ready. During the game the player must not leave the court except in the act of playing, if he has an accident, or with the referee's permission for activities such as changing a racket, tying a shoelace, or tightening a belt. The referee normally grants a player's request for such activities, unless the ball is in play; however, he has the final right to refuse if he deems such activities delaying tactics. \nIn \"fives\" tournaments, a team consists of ten formally designated players, any five of whom play while the other five remain on the sidelines with the team manager, ready to play. Doubles tournaments use teams of three players. During a match of two or three games, three player substitutions are allowed. Substitutions may be made at any time during the game. The ball may not be changed during a three-game match set, unless it is damaged.\n\nIf a fault is made by the serving team, the serving player shall be replaced by a teammate. If all five players on a team commit a serving fault, the serve goes to the receiving team. If a fault is made by the receiving team, the serving team is awarded a point and continues to serve.\nIt is a fault if:\n\nA match consists of three games. The team that wins two out of three games is the match winner. The team first scoring the 34th point wins a game. \nTeams start each game from the side opposite the one they played the previous game. There is a break of two minutes between the end of the first game and the start of the second game, and five minutes between the second and the third games. \nChoice of side and the right of first service is decided by a coin toss at the beginning of a match. If the team winning the toss chooses to serve, the other team has the choice of side and vice versa. \nAt the beginning of a match the referee allows two trials, one from each side. After the trials are over, the umpire shall call \"play\" and regular play begins. A ball is in play from the time a player attempts to serve until it touches the ground or until a \"fault\" or \"let\" (a re-serve) is called by the umpire.\n\nThe officiating team consists of one umpire, two or more line referees and a scorer. When the umpire calls \"play\", if a team refuses to play it forfeits the match. The umpire is the sole judge on the fairness of a play, weather and lighting conditions. His decisions are final. It is the umpire's responsibility to call \"fault\" or \"let\", with (or without) an appeal from the players. If an umpire erroneously calls \"fault\" and immediately corrects himself and calls \"play\" but the striker fails to return the ball, a \"let\" is allowed. Umpires serve for an entire match, unless a change is authorized by the tournament committee. Each of the two (or more) line referees is responsible for one boundary line and one half of the side line opposite the umpire, in addition to any other duties assigned by the umpire. Referees signal the umpire in a code prescribed by the BFF. The scorer records the points scored and the number of hands on the score sheet. A ball may be replaced by an umpire if it is lost or damaged. The umpire can overrule a line referee's decision, if he feels that an error has been committed.\n\nThe umpire is also responsible for the net. He announces the score (for the benefit of the scorer) when a point is scored or a server is out. In announcing the score he calls the number of the serving hand, followed by the score of the serving team and the score of the other team.\nIf a match is suspended by the umpire for any reason (e.g. weather and light), it is resumed from the point at which it was stopped. In case of a tie between two or more teams in any tournament, a match is not replayed. If the tie is unbroken, teams are ranked based on game and point scores. In a league tournament, if two (or more) teams have identical won/lost records their game scores are used to break the tie.\n\nGame Scoring\n\nThe number of games won and lost by each team in each league match is recorded. Keeping in mind that each match is played as a best of three games, a team winning a match after three games has won two games and lost one. If a team wins a match in two straight games, its official won/lost record is 3–0. The losing team in each case has a record of 1–2 and 0–3, respectively. The difference between the number of games won and lost is a team's game score. The team with the highest game score is the winner in the event of a tie; if two or more teams have the same game score, their point scores will also break the tie.\n\nPoint Score\n\nPoints scored in each game by each team in all league matches are recorded. A team winning a match in two straight games, after recording the points scored for and against in the two games played also receives 35 points in favour and zero points against for the third (unplayed) game. Correspondingly, zero points in favour and 35 points against are recorded for the losing team. The difference between total points in favour and against in all the matches is a team's point score. The team scoring the most net points (for minus against) is the winner.\n\nThe umpire can warn a player if the player behaves on-court in a manner bringing discredit to the referee, other players or the officials, or otherwise lowering the image of the game. A second warning triggers a yellow card. A third warning triggers a red card and ejection from the game; following a red card, the player's team continues with four players. A team manager substitute for a player shown a yellow card, if a sufficient number of substitutions remain.\n\n\n\n"}

Its jumps course, meanwhile, was two and a half miles round, with nine plain fences, two open ditches and one water jump. It was here that the first steeplechase recorded in Scotland took place on 25 April 1839.\n\nDuring its existence it hosted the Scottish Grand National (now contested at nearby Ayr) and twice hosted the National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup which now takes place at the Cheltenham Festival. Its other major race was the Bogside Cup.\n\nAmong the most notable achievements at the course was jockey Alec Russell riding all six winners in a day on 19 July 1957.\n\nFor a short time the racecourse had its own railway station, Bogside Racecourse.\n\nIn 1963, the Levy Board opted to cease funding the course, declaring 'When Ayr is developed as the main Scottish course, racing under both rules, the retention of Bogside, only 12 miles away, cannot be economically justified'. Racing at Bogside ceased soon thereafter.\n\nPoint-to-Point meetings took place at Bogside until 1994, and evidence of the former racecourse still remains.\n\n"}

{"id": "2085345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085345", "title": "Carbide lamp", "text": "Carbide lamp\n\nCarbide lamps, or acetylene gas lamps, are simple lamps that produce and burn acetylene (CH) which is created by the reaction of calcium carbide (CaC) with water (HO).\n\nAcetylene gas lamps were used to illuminate buildings, as lighthouse beacons, and as headlights on motor-cars and bicycles. Portable acetylene gas lamps, worn on the hat or carried by hand, were widely used in mining in the early twentieth century. They are still employed by cavers, hunters, and cataphiles. Small carbide lamps called \"carbide candles\" or \"smokers\" are used for blackening rifle sights to reduce glare. They are used because of the sooty flame produced by acetylene.\n\nA mining or caving lamp has calcium carbide placed in a lower chamber, the generator. The upper reservoir is then filled with water. A threaded valve or other mechanism is used to control the rate at which the water is allowed to drip into the chamber containing the calcium carbide. By controlling the rate of water flow, the production of acetylene gas is controlled. This, in turn, controls the flow rate of the gas and the size of the flame at the burner, and thus the amount of light it produces.\n\nThis type of lamp generally has a reflector behind the flame to help project the light forward. An acetylene gas powered lamp produces a bright, broad light. Many cavers prefer this type of unfocused light as it improves peripheral vision in the complete dark. The reaction of carbide with water is exothermic and produces a fair amount of heat independent of the flame. In cold caves, carbide lamp users can use this heat to help stave off hypothermia.\n\nAcetylene is produced by the reaction:\n\nThe acetylene combusts easily in the atmosphere:\n\nWhen all of the carbide in a lamp has been reacted, the carbide chamber contains a wet paste of slaked lime (Ca(OH)) which can be used to make a cement. This is emptied into a waste bag and the chamber can be refilled.\n\nIn 1892, Thomas Willson discovered an economically efficient process for creating calcium carbide in an electric arc furnace from a mixture of lime and coke. The arc furnace provides the high temperature required to drive the reaction. Manufacture of calcium carbide was an important part of the industrial revolution in chemistry, and was made possible in the US as a result of massive amounts of inexpensive hydroelectric power produced at Niagara Falls before the turn of the twentieth century. In 1895, Willson sold his patent to Union Carbide. Domestic lighting with acetylene gas was introduced circa 1894 and bicycle lamps from 1896. In France, Gustave Trouvé, a Parisian electrical engineer, also made domestic acetylene lamps and gasometers.\n\nThe first carbide bicycle lamp developed in the United States was patented in New York on August 28, 1900 by Frederick Baldwin. Another early lamp design is shown in a patent from Duluth, Minnesota on October 21, 1902. In the early 1900s, Gustaf Dalén invented the Dalén light. This combined two of Dalén's previous inventions: the substrate Agamassan and the Sun valve. Inventions and improvements to carbide lamps continued for decades.\n\nAfter carbide lamp open flames were implicated in an Illinois coal-seam methane gas explosion that killed 54 miners, the 1932 Moweaqua Coal Mine disaster, carbide lamp use declined in United States coal mines. They continued to be used in the coal pits of other countries, notably Russia and the Ukraine.\n\nIn the birth of the cinema of Iquitos, a carbide lamp was used as light support to project the first film in the Casa de Fierro, in 1900.\n\nCarbide lighting was used in rural and urban areas of the United States which were not served by electrification. Its use began shortly after 1900 and continued past 1950. Calcium carbide pellets were placed in a container outside the home, with water piped to the container and allowed to drip on the pellets releasing acetylene. This gas was piped to lighting fixtures inside the house, where it was burned, creating a very bright flame. Carbide lighting was inexpensive but was prone to gas leaks and explosions.\n\nEarly models of the Ford Model T automobile used carbide lamps as headlamps. Acetylene lamps were also used on riverboats for night navigation. The National Museum of Australia has a lamp made in about 1910 that was used on board , a paddle steamer which has been restored to working order and also in the museum's collection.\n\nThey are also used for night hunting.\n\nEarly caving enthusiasts, not yet having the advantage of light-weight electrical illumination, introduced the carbide lamp to their hobby. While increasingly replaced by more modern choices, a substantial percentage of cavers still use this method.\n\nIn cave surveys, carbide lamps are favoured for the lead or \"point\" surveyor, who must identify suitable points in the cave to designate as survey stations. The sooty carbide flame may be used to mark cave walls with a station label. Especially favoured for this purpose are all-brass lamps or lamps made with no ferromagnetic metals, as these lamps do not deflect the needles of a magnetic compass, which is typically read while brightly illuminated from above using the caver's lamp.\n\nApart from their use as cave surveying tools, many cavers favour carbide lamps for their durability and quality of illumination. They were once favoured for their relative illumination per mass of fuel compared to battery powered devices, but this advantage was largely negated with the advent of high-intensity LED illumination.\n\nThe acetylene producing reaction is exothermic, which means that the lamp's reactor vessel will become quite warm to the touch; this can be used to warm the hands. The heat from the flame can also be used to warm the body by allowing the exhaust gases to flow under a shirt or poncho pulled out from the body, a technique discovered almost immediately by cold miners, and nicknamed by cavers the \"Palmer furnace\".\n\n\n\n"}

The stadium was owned by the Bahia government, and was the home ground of Esporte Clube Bahia and Esporte Clube Vitória. Its formal name honors Octávio Cavalcanti Mangabeira, a civil engineer, journalist, and former Bahia state governor from 1947 to 1954.\n\nAfter part of the upper terraces collapsed in 2007, killing 7 people and injuring several others, the government of Bahia announced the demolition of Fonte Nova and the construction of a new stadium, the Arena Fonte Nova, in the same place.\n\nThe stadium was nicknamed Fonte Nova because it was located at Ladeira das Fontes das Pedras.\n\nThe stadium construction ended in 1951. On March 4, 1971, the stadium was reinaugurated, after a great reformation involving the addition of a second tier, which expanded the maximum stadium capacity from 35,000 to 110,000. In the reinauguration day, two matches were played: Bahia against Flamengo, and Vitória against Grêmio. On that day happened a big tumult, where two people died.\n\nThe inaugural match was played on January 28, 1951, when Guarany and Botafogo, both local Bahia state teams, drew 2-1. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Guarany's Nélson.\n\nThe stadium's attendance record currently stands at 110,438, set on February 12, 1989 when Bahia beat Fluminense 2-1.\n\nOn November 25, 2007, when the Brazilian Championship Third Division match between Bahia and Vila Nova was nearly over with more than 60,000 supporters in attendance, a section of the stadium's highest terraces collapsed when Bahia's supporters were celebrating the club's promotion to the Brazilian Championship Second Division, killing seven people and injuring forty others. Jacques Wagner, who is the governor of Bahia state, ordered the stadium to be closed as the causes of the accident are under investigation by the authorities, and he also said on November 26, 2007 that the stadium may be demolished if its structure is compromised. On November 27, 2007, the governor of Bahia announced that Estádio Fonte Nova will be demolished, and a new stadium will be built in its place. On September 28, 2008, Bahia's governor Jaques Wagner announced that instead of being demolished, the stadium will be reformed into a multiuse arena with a maximum capacity of 60,000 people seated.\n\nDemolition of the Octavio Mangabeira Stadium began in June 2010 and is expected to be finished by August - the upper tier was demolished using explosives on August 29, 2010. After the implosion, a portion of the upper tier was left standing, which was dismantled manually until October. The Bahia Arena is being constructed as a venue for the 2016 Summer Olympics for football tournaments. During its construction, Bahia plays in Estádio de Pituaçu.\n\n"}

A longtime home to minor league hockey, the arena is currently home to the Binghamton Devils of the American Hockey League.\n\nThe first act was the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, in an unfinished Arena in May 1973. Chicago played the first concert at the arena (with Bruce Springsteen as opener) on June 13, 1973. The ribbon cutting and first event on ice was with the Ice Capades; and the Broome Dusters of the North American Hockey League were the building's first full-time tenant. The Broome Dusters became the Binghamton Dusters in 1977 and moved into the American Hockey League. That AHL franchise would go through a number of name changes, becoming the Whalers and Rangers before moving in 1997. The BC Icemen, of the United Hockey League, occupied the Arena for five seasons until the AHL returned. From 2002 to 2016, the Arena was home to the Binghamton Senators, who were affiliated with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League. In 2017, the Senators were replaced with the New Jersey Devils' affiliate, the Binghamton Devils.\n\nIn 2016 the Arena became the home court for the New York International Academy Eagles, a post grad basketball academy located in Endicott, New York.\n\nThe Arena has hosted some notable names in entertainment -AC/DC, Bob Dylan, B.B.

It was the home of the Newark Tornadoes of the National Football League during the 1930 season. The stadium was used for high school football until 2006. Baseball's Newark Stars of the Eastern Colored League, which was a part of the Negro Leagues, also used the stadium in 1926. Its primary use, however, was for Newark's high schools. The original stadium was a reinforced concrete horseshoe shaped venue that had a maximum seating capacity of 25,000.\n\nThe original stadium was condemned in 2006 and demolished in 2009. In its place, a brand new Schools Stadium was constructed on the site and the new stadium opened in 2011.\n\nThe current Schools Stadium shares some design elements with its predecessor but seats far fewer people (5,600) in two metal bleacher sections. It currently plays host to football games played by Barringer High School, East Side High School, and Newark Collegiate Academy. The new Schools Stadium is one of three venues used by Newark's high schools; Shabazz High School and Weequahic High School both have football stadiums. Shabazz's field, Shabazz Stadium, is also used by Newark Central High School. Weequahic's Untermann Field is also home to West Side High School's football team.\n\nFor the 1967-68 ASL (American Soccer League) season, the Newark Ukrainian Sitch club moved its home games to this field. Prior to that season, 'Sitch' played at Ironbound field. The move to an approx. 25,000 capacity ground was welcomed as an improvement. The crowds never filled the stadium however and the Ukrainian Weekly refers to crowds only in the hundreds rather than thousands.\n\nAfter the Tornadoes folded, Newark's American Association team became the primary tenants for the stadium. The American Association was the first attempt at establishing a farm system for the NFL. In 1937, the Tornadoes left Orange, New Jersey again for Newark. The team was once again called the Newark Tornadoes. In 1939, the team was purchased by George Halas, the owner of the Chicago Bears, and called the Newark Bears. The Bears played in the stadium until World War II; the Newark Bombers would play in the same league and stadium in 1946 after the war ended. In 1963, another Bears franchise would arrive when the Paterson Miners of the Atlantic Coast Football League moved to Newark, took on the Bears name, and played through 1965; its last year in Newark was in the Continental Football League. Another Continental league team, the Jersey Jays, played its 1969 season in Newark before moving to nearby Jersey City in 1970.\n\nMost of Newark's public school football teams played at the stadium as well until 2006. The Stadium also served, since 1955 until its closing for reconstruction, as the home of the North Newark Little League (formerly the Saint Francis Xavier Little League).\n\nSchools Stadium was also used for baseball. In 1926, the Newark Stars of the Negro Leagues' Eastern Colored League played at stadium. When the stadium was configured for baseball, the distance down the foul lines was so short, that balls hit over the fence were ground rule doubles. High school teams also used the field for baseball until 2006. The Stadium was also the original home of what has become one of the largest youth baseball programs in the City of Newark - the North Newark Little League. Formerly the St. Francis Xavier Little League, the youth of the program utilized the baseball fields from 1955. It was the last organization to have continued use of the facility (even after it was condemned in 2006) right up to the point of its closing for reconstruction.\n\nOlympian Jesse Owens, once ran track there and lost to a Newark local named Eulace Peacock. Meanwhile, another Olympian, Milt Campbell began his track career at Newark Schools Stadium. The National Women's Olympic Trials also were held in the stadium in 1928.\n\nDuring the 1967 Newark riots, Schools Stadium served as the staging area for the New Jersey National Guard, who were summoned to Newark to reinforce the overwhelmed Newark Police Department.\n\nYears of neglect allowed the stadium to experience a large amount of deterioration and compromised structural integrity. At various points in its later years, parts of the stadium's wooden bleachers were blocked off with fencing to prevent spectators from sitting in these seats.\n\nIn 2006, a capital bond request was approved by the Newark City Council that included $63.7 million in funding for 14 projects that ranged from a new robotics center to the rebuilding of Schools Stadium. In Fall 2006, Schools Stadium was condemned and three years later the stadium was demolished. Barringer and East Side moved their games to Untermann Field while the new stadium was being constructed.\n\n"}

{"id": "2545972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2545972", "title": "Rogaining", "text": "Rogaining\n\nRogaining is an orienteering sport of long distance cross-country navigation, involving both route planning and navigation between checkpoints using a variety of map types. In a rogaine, teams of 2–5 people choose which checkpoints to visit within a time limit with the intent of maximizing their score. Teamwork, endurance, competition and an appreciation for the natural environment are features of the sport. Championship rogaines are 24 hours long, but rogaines can be as short as two hours.\n\nRogaining can trace its roots back to 1947 when the first of many events with some of the features of rogaines was organized by the Melbourne University Mountaineering Club. The events from the 1940s eventually led to the birth of the sport of rogaining in April 1976, in Melbourne, Australia. The sport was named, rules were adopted and the world’s first rogaining association was formed (the Victorian Rogaining Association). Growth of the association and the sport occurred rapidly over the next decade.\n\nThe word rogaining is derived from the names of three of the founders, Rod Phillips, Gail Davis (née Phillips) and Neil Phillips (RoGaiNe, hence 'rogaining', 'rogainer' etc.) who were all members of the Surrey-Thomas Rover Crew which organized the world's first rogaine. The name was formally adopted by the Victorian Rogaining Association at its inaugural annual general meeting in August 1976 and accepted by Scouts Australia and University bushwalking groups to give the new sport an identity in its own right.\n\nWorld Rogaining Championships were first held in 1992, and then every two years from 1996 to 2012. Since then they have been held annually, with the country chosen two years in advance by the International Rogaining Federation. As of 2017 this has changed back again to every two years.\n\n\nTeams of two to five members visit as many checkpoints as possible in the time allowed. Shorter duration rogaines often allow solo competitors. Checkpoints are scored differently depending on level of difficulty in reaching them; therefore teams choose a strategy (for example, to visit many low score checkpoints). Teams travel entirely on foot, navigating by map and compass between checkpoints in terrain that varies from open farmland to hilly forest. A central base camp known as a \"hash house\" provides hot meals throughout the event and teams may return at any time to eat, rest or sleep. Teams travel at their own pace and anyone from children to grandparents can experience the personal satisfaction that comes from cross-country navigation at their own level of competition and comfort. Team members stay within earshot of each other.\n\nThe duration of a championship rogaine is 24 hours, but shorter variations such as 3-, 6-, 8-, 12- and 15-hour events are also held (sometimes concurrently with a 24-hour event). Depending on the terrain, experienced rogaining teams can cover more than one hundred kilometers over the 24-hour period. There have also been longer events (dubbed \"Endurogaines\") lasting 48 and 50 hours. In their native Australia, rogaines are usually held every month during weekends near full moons, with annual state championships and an annual national championship. They require dozens of volunteers to run, including course setters and caterers and are often attended by hundreds of participants.

In 1999, at a time when horse racing was experiencing a decline as casinos and lotteries became commonplace, New Mexico legislators allowed slot machines at the track. Now with over 700 machines in play, racing at Sunland has benefited greatly, with purses increasing from a $35,000 daily average in the early 1990s to nearly a quarter million per day today.\n\nSunland Park was the track where jockeys Jerry Bailey, Pat Valenzuela, and Cash Asmussen got their starts. Bill Shoemaker, who hails from the area, also rode at Sunland.\n\nThe casino, open 112 hours a week, also offers many electronic table games including roulette, blackjack and Texas Hold 'Em.\n\nThe 2018 racing season, which features both Thoroughbreds and Quarter Horses, runs from December 28 through May 5. Live racing is traditionally offered four days each week on Tuesdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Year-round Simulcast wagering is also available on racetracks across the country.\n\nThe live racing season is highlighted by the Sunland Derby, run at 1⅛ miles for three-year-olds in late March of each year. The race was granted a Grade 3 status for the 2010 running and now is an important preparatory race for the Kentucky Derby. The graded ranking is important because the Kentucky Derby uses graded stakes earnings to determine which horse(s) will be permitted to enter if its limit of 20 entries is exceeded.\n\nOther notable races include the $200,000 Sunland Park Oaks, 1-1/16 miles Kentucky Oaks prep for fillies; the $100,000 Harry W. Henson Handicap for fillies and mares at one mile; the $100,000 Riley Allison Derby, 6½ furlongs for three-year-olds; the $100,000 Mine That Bird Derby, 1 1/16-mile prep for the Sunland Derby; and the $150,000 Sunland Park Handicap for three-year-olds and up at 1⅛ miles. \n\nSunland's top quarter horse race is the $350,000 Grade 1 Championship at Sunland Park, run late each December at 440 yards. The $140,000 added New Mexican Spring Futurity at 300 yards is run in April.\n"}

It was located near Korsvägen, on the site that currently is the Swedish Exhibition and Congress Centre. Walhalla IP was in use between 1908 and 1921.\n\nWalhalla IP was built by Örgryte IS in 1908 to replace their old stadium Balders Hage as the Swedish Football Association had banned international football on it. The city deeded land to Örgryte IS for this purpose, which today is used by the Swedish Exhibition and Congress Centre, opposite to amusement park Liseberg.\n\nThe roofed main stand had 1,200 seats, and another 6,800 spectators could be accommodated on terraces around the pitch. The stadium was modelled after Liverpool F.C.'s Anfield. At the time of its opening, Walhalla IP was the most modern stadium in Scandinavia. The pitch was enclosed by a slightly longer than 400 metre running track and other athletics facilities, and several Swedish athletics championships were held in the stadium.\n\nThe inauguration match was played on 6 September 1908, between Örgryte and German champions Viktoria Berlin. It was the main venue for sports events in Sweden until Stockholm Olympic Stadium was opened in 1912. The Swedish national team played its first ever international against England national football team on Walhalla IP in September 1908, and IFK Göteborg—that rented the stadium from Örgryte IS—won their two first Swedish championships, in 1908 and 1910, there.\n\nIn 1912, the stadium was the scene of one of the first known instances of Swedish football hooliganism. IFK Göteborg supporters stormed the pitch to get to the referee, who had first awarded IFK a penalty kick against Örgryte IS in the last minute of the match, but then blown the final whistle before the kick could be taken.\n\nIFK Göteborg left Walhalla IP for newly built Ullevi in 1916. The land on which Walhalla IP stood was chosen as one of the sites for the 1923 Gothenburg Tercentennial Jubilee Exposition, and Örgryte IS was forced to move from the stadium as a consequence. The last event at Walhalla was an international sports gala arranged by Örgryte and held on 25 September 1921.\n\n"}

The ballpark has a capacity of 5,000 people and opened in 1940.\n\nIt is currently used by Watertown High School, to host baseball and football games.\n\nThe stadium was built around the 1930s as Works Progress Administration Project 4265, and still holds the original plaque dedicating the structure. It is the home of the Watertown Arrows.\n\nIn 2005, an additional building was built to the East of the field. This building houses restrooms, a concession stand, and both Varsity and Sophomore locker rooms.\n\nThe stadium was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It is built of reinforced concrete.\n\nIts NRHP nomination asserts:The Watertown Stadium is a physical reminder of the unprecedented use of government aid to construct community improvements, particularly for recreation and leisure. Built in 1940, the stadium was reportedly planned as a band shelter, since the W.P.A. wanted to build them as part of their music project. According to a local story, the structure was built in phases, and it initially looked more like a bandshell. During the last phase of construction, it was then modified for use as an athletic stadium. Although the story is rumor, the existing structure is an excellent example of W.P.A. construction and one of the more outstanding federal relief projects in the northeastern part of the state.\n\n"}
{"id": "372464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=372464", "title": "Wire loop game", "text": "Wire loop game\n\nA wire loop game is a game which involves guiding a metal loop (a 'probe') along a serpentine length of wire without touching the loop to the wire. The loop and wire are connected to a power source in such a way that, if they touch, they form a closed electric circuit. The circuit is connected to a light or sound-emitting device of some sort, so that when the loop and the wire touch, the light-emitting device will light up, and the sound-emitting device will make a sound, traditionally a buzzing noise.\n\nVirtual versions of this game exist, in which the pointer takes the place of the wire loop and must be guided down a narrow, twisting path without touching the sides. Both versions require well-developed hand-eye coordination. The difficulty of any particular game depends in part on the shape of the twisted wire and the size of the loop.\n\nOne example of a virtual version of this game is 'The Wire Loop Game VR', designed to be played in virtual reality using the HTC Vive headset. The player holds a motion controller, representing the hoop in the game, and uses it to move along the wire inside a virtual room.\n"}
