The game was played on October 7, 1916, between the Georgia Tech Engineers and Cumberland College Bulldogs at Grant Field (now a part of Bobby Dodd Stadium) in Atlanta.\n\nWith Cumberland opting to punt on multiple possessions, the infamous score can be partially attributed to 97% of the game's plays occurring in Cumberland territory, with 64 of those plays occurring in Cumberland's own red zone.\n\nCumberland College, a Presbyterian school in Lebanon, Tennessee, had discontinued its football program before the season but was not allowed to cancel its game against the Engineers. The fact that Cumberland's baseball team had crushed Georgia Tech earlier that year 22–0 (amidst allegations that Cumberland used professionals as ringers) probably accounted for Georgia Tech coach John Heisman's running up the score on the Bulldogs, as Heisman was also Georgia Tech's baseball coach. It is speculated that Heisman may have deliberately aimed for a score of exactly 222 as a numerically significant retaliation to Cumberland's 22. He insisted on the schools' scheduling agreement, which required Cumberland to pay $3,000 () to Tech if its football team failed to show. In fact, Heisman actually paid Cumberland $500 () as an incentive to play the game; his letter to Cumberland's athletic department read in part:\n\nGeorge E. Allen (who was elected to serve as Cumberland's football team student manager after first serving as the baseball team student manager) therefore put together a team of 12–16 players, most of whom were his fraternity brothers, to travel to Atlanta as Cumberland's football team.\n\nAnother reason for Heisman's plan to run up the score was the practice among the sportswriters of the time to rank teams based upon how many points they scored. Since this statistic did not account for the strength or weakness of a team's opponent, Heisman disagreed with the amount of weight the writers tended to assign to it, and he may have unleashed his players on Cumberland to make his point.\n\nCumberland received the opening kickoff and failed to make a first down. After a punt, the Engineers scored on their first play. Cumberland then fumbled on their next play from the line of scrimmage, and a Georgia Tech player returned the fumble for a touchdown. The Bulldogs fumbled again on their next play, and it took Georgia Tech two rushes to score its third touchdown. Cumberland lost nine yards on its next possession, and Georgia Tech scored a fourth touchdown on another two-play drive.\n\nGeorgia Tech led 63–0 after the first quarter and 126–0 at halftime. Georgia Tech added 54 more points in the third quarter and 42 in the final period.\n\nGeorgia Tech scored a total of 32 touchdowns, and Georgia Tech's left end James Preas kicked 18 extra points. Cumberland's only effective defense was an extra point blocked with a sort of human pyramid.\n\nSeveral myths have developed around the game. Some have written that Cumberland did not have a single play that gained yards; in fact, its longest play was a 10-yard pass (on 4th-and-22 or 3rd-and-18). One page on Cumberland's website says Georgia Tech scored on every offensive play, but the play-by-play account of the game refutes this and suggests a more likely scenario: that Georgia Tech scored on every one of its sets of downs. However, neither team made a first down that was not also a touchdown, as Cumberland made no first downs in the entire game.\n\nCumberland purportedly committed 15 turnovers—nine fumbles and six interceptions—during the game.\n\nSportswriter Grantland Rice wrote, \"Cumberland's greatest individual play of the game occurred when fullback Allen circled right end for a 6-yard loss.\" At halftime, Heisman reportedly told his players, \"You're doing all right, team, we're ahead. But you just can't tell what those Cumberland players have up their sleeves. They may spring a surprise. Be alert, men! Hit 'em clean, but hit 'em hard!\" However, even Heisman relented, and shortened the third and fourth quarters from 15 minutes to 12.\n\nSince World War II, only a handful of schools have topped 100 points in a college football game. The modern-era record for most points scored against a college opponent is 106 by Fort Valley State of Georgia against Knoxville College in 1969. In the previous year Houston defeated Tulsa 100–6 to set the NCAA record in major college football. In 1949 the University of Wyoming defeated University of Northern Colorado 103–0. The Division III football scoring record was set in 1968 when North Park University defeated North Central College 104–32, using ten passing touchdowns along the way.\n\nThe game ball had the score written on it as a memento. It was donated to the Helms Athletic Foundation sports museum by Bill Schroeder, an avid sports collector. When the museum moved locations in the 1980s, the ball was boxed and remained in storage. In 2014, Ryan Schneider, a Georgia Tech alumnus, purchased the ball in a charity auction for $40,388 ($33,657 without buyer's premium), with the intention of donating it back to Georgia Tech.\n\nIn October 1956, a 40th reunion was held for players from both teams, of whom 28 were able to attend. While reminiscing, one of the Cumberland players pointed out one play that saved Cumberland from an even worse defeat; had Cumberland punted as normal instead of running a sneak, the score would probably have been 229–0.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "356919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=356919", "title": "Bare-knuckle boxing", "text": "Bare-knuckle boxing\n\nBare-knuckle boxing (also known as bare-knuckle, prizefighting, fist fight or fisticuffs) is the original form of boxing, closely related to ancient combat sports. It involves two individuals fighting without boxing gloves or other padding on their hands.\n\nThe difference between street fighting and a bare-knuckle boxing match is that the latter has an accepted set of rules, such as not striking a downed opponent.\n\nThe first bare-knuckle champion of England was James Figg, who claimed the title in 1719 and held it until his retirement in 1730. Before Jack Broughton, the first idea of current boxing originated from James Figg, who is viewed as the organizer of cutting edge boxing. In 1719, he set up a 'pugilistic foundation' and charged himself as 'a professional in the Noble Science of Defense' to instruct boxers on the utilization of clench hands, sword, and quarterstaff. Noted champions were Jack Broughton, Elizabeth Wilkinson, Daniel Mendoza, Jem Belcher, Hen Pearce, John Gully, Tom Cribb, Tom Spring, Jem Ward, James Burke, William \"Bendigo\" Thompson, Ben Caunt, William Perry, Tom Sayers and Jem Mace.\n\nThe record for the longest bare-knuckle fight is listed as 6 hours and 15 minutes for a match between James Kelly and Jonathan Smith, fought near Fiery Creek, Victoria, Australia, on December 3, 1855, when Smith gave in after 17 rounds.\n\nThe bare-knuckle fighter Jem Mace is listed as having the longest professional career of any fighter in history. He fought for more than 35 years into his 60s, and recorded his last exhibition bout in 1909 at the age of 79.\n\nProfessional bare-knuckle boxing was never legal under any federal or state laws in the United States until Wyoming became the first to legalize on March 20, 2018. Prior to that date, the chief sanctioning organization for bare-knuckle boxing was the magazine \"National Police Gazette\", which set up matches and issued championship belts throughout the 1880s. The \"Police Gazette\" sanctioned what is considered the last major bare-knuckle heavyweight world championship, between John L. Sullivan and Jake Kilrain on July 8, 1889, with Sullivan emerging as the victor. Since then, other claimants to being sanctioned bare-knuckle championship bouts include the August 5, 2011, match at Fort McDowell Casino on the Yavapai Nation reservation in Arizona. The Native American tribe sanctioned the bout between Rich Stewart of New Castle, Delaware and Bobby Gunn, with Gunn emerging as the victor. Other noted champions were Tom Hyer, Yankee Sullivan, Nonpareil Dempsey, Tom Sharkey, Bob Fitzsimmons and John Morrissey.\n\nWhile boxing has always included punching, historically it also included grappling techniques like throws, arm locks, chokes as well as kicks. These techniques were banned during the several rule changes which turned classical pugilism, or bare knuckle boxing, into the modern sport of boxing.\n\n\"Irish stand down\" is a type of traditional bare knuckle fighting where the aspect of maneuvering around the ring is removed, leaving only the less nuanced aspects of punching and \"taking\" punches. This form of combat was popular in Irish American ghettos in the United States in the late 19th century but was eclipsed in the Irish American community first by bare knuckle boxing and then later by regulation boxing. The Irish stand down is also known as strap fighting or toe to toe.\n\nModern Bareknuckle Combat, a contemporary form of fist fight, exists on a small scale worldwide, however, recently it has been making its way into the public eye.\n\nIn the United States, publicly ticketed events started in the 1990s in the Rocky Mountains, promoted by Jim Smith's Poorboys Professional Boxing. In 2007, Corey Williams and his promotion Who's Your Daddy Productions stepped onto the scene. After years of false starts due to claims that the sport was \"brutal\" Mr. Williams conducted a medical study proving that bare knuckle combat is in fact safer than its gloved counterpart. Mr. Williams medical research and his publicly ticketed events in Wyoming lead to the States Combat Sports Commission to becoming the first to legitimize the sport of Bare Knuckle Fighting by sanctioning it.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, promoters Joe Brown and Jim Freeman Dove (following a visit to America to observe Mr. Williams program) have made strides furthering bare knuckle combat in England. Their promotion, BKB, was the first legal Bare Knuckle promotion in the United Kingdom. There are now several UK promotions successfully conducting shows including UBKB, Rouge Elite and Barefist.\n\nBare Knuckle Fighting bouts have several changes from traditional gloved boxing rules, notably there is a 20-second count on any knockdown and the fights consist of 3x2 minute rounds, 5x2/7x2 on title fights.\n\nBKB has put on shows all over the United Kingdom including prestigious venues such as the Echo Arena in Liverpool and the O2 Arena in London. BKB have fighters with backgrounds from professional boxing and MMA promotions such as UFC and Bellator.\n\nDavid Feldman was able to get a fully sanctioned bare knuckle boxing match on Saturday, June 2 in Cheyenne, WY, which was the first-ever legal, regulated, and sanctioned bare-knuckle fight the U.S. in 130 years. A second fight was sanctioned in Biloxi, Mississippi on Aug 26, 2018. A third fight was sanctioned in on October 20, 2018 in Biloxi.\n\n\n\nDavid Snowdon, \"Writing the Prizefight: Pierce Egan's Boxiana World\" (2013)\n\n"}

It has four member organizations: Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Visually Impaired (FECASDEV), Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Physically Disabled (FECASDEP), Cameroonian Federation of Sports the Intellectually Disabled (FECASDI) and the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Deaf (FECASSO). The President of the Cameroonian Paralympic Committee is Jean Jacques Ndoudoumou. The organization has four vice presidents, who all serve as the presidents of CNPC's member organizations.\n\nThe CNPC's history dates to the early 2010s, following a period where the country's previous National Paralympic Committee (NPC) had poor relations with the government of Cameroon and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). After the CNPC was formally created and recognized by law, the created a strategic plan and set about capacity building activities. The CNPC has some funding via grants and sponsorship. Future success for the CNPC is perceived by insiders as being dependent on government support for the Paralympic movement in Cameroon.\n\nThe CNPC has four member organizations. These are Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Visually Impaired (FECASDEV), the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Physically Disabled (FECASDEP), Cameroonian Federation of Sports the Intellectually Disabled (FECASDI) and the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Deaf (FECASSO).\n\nThe President of the Cameroonian Paralympic Committee is Jean Jacques Ndoudoumou. Ndoudoumou has held this position since the organization was formally created on August 21, 2011. Prior to taking on this role, he was the General Director of the Agence de régulation des marchés publics (ARMP). He also served as the President of the Cameroon branch of the World Association for Advocacy and Solidarity of Albinos (ASMODISA). He got he role following the elections for the position in August 2011, winning a four-year term after collecting 84 of the 87 available votes where he was the only candidate running. Ndoudoumou had been accused of mismanagement while serving as the General Director of the Regulatory Board for Public Procurement (ARMP) before he was fired from his position. Those same elections also saw Ebot Ntui become a Vice President. He had previously served as the ministre chargé de missions à la Présidence de la République. Etienne Songa has been CNPC's Secretary General since 2009. In October 2014, Songa traveled to Brazzaville, Congo to give a presentation to the Congolese National Paralympic Committee (French: Comité national paralympique congolais).\n\nThe organization has four vice presidents, who all serve as the presidents of CNPC's member organizations. These vice-presidents include FECASDI's Jean-Marie Aléokol Mabiemé, FECASDEP's Herve Guy Ngoyo Ngon, FECASDEV's Norbert Tsoungui and FECASSO's Pierre Valery Pemha. Other officers and key organizational personnel include Vice President Ogork Ntui Obot, Chief Financial Officer Christophe Ampoam, Deputy Secretary General Nazaire Ubalt Olinga, Deputy Financial Officer Jules Benjamin Mateck Ma Bilolo’o, Athlete Representative Constance Nchifi and Coach Representative Martin Luther Adibita.\n\nThe organization's mission is to develop partnerships and mobilize resources in Cameroon to support the country's para-sportspeople. They have a vision of developing para-sports in Cameroon to assist in creating a society that is more inclusive and equitable for people with disabilities. They are supposed to be apolitical in all their dealings. The organization is headquartered in Yaounde.\n\nPrior to the creation of the CNPC, the NPC for Cameroon was the Cameroonian Sports Federation for People with Disabilities (FECASH). The Federation had a number of issues including lack of organizational status, potentially not being recognized by the Cameroonian government and by the IPC, and claims of several NPCs all claiming to represent Cameroon being in existence. Cameroon's NPC had also been repeatedly suspended by the IPC as a result of problems related to the Ministry of Sports and the CNPC, with the IPC recognizing the CNPC but the Government of Cameroon not recognizing the CNPC as the country's NPC, and because the NPC had failed to pay IPC membership fees. One suspension occurred in 2003, and another from 2005 that included 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nLaw No. 2011-18 of 15 July 2011 related to the organization and promotion of Physical and Sporting Activities created by force of law the government recognized Cameroonian National Paralympic Committee, addressing earlier issues related to lack of government recognition of a National Paralympic Committee. FECASH had been dissolved by the same law. The law recognized and made FECASDEV, FECASDEP, FECASDI and FECASSO as four member federations of the CNPC.\n\nFollowing the formal legislative creation of the CNPC in 2011, the organization and its four new member organizations had 30 days to hold elections for the boards of these organizations. Candidates to head the CNPC were already known prior to the election announcement, with FECASH Chairman Abeng Mbozo'o having bowed out of contention before then. The process leading to the CNPC's creation began in March 2011. The organization changed their name to \"Comité National Paralympique Camerounais (CNPC)\" on August 21, 2011. The name change and changes in the law signaled major change in the organization. In December 2011 in Beijing, the CNPC participated in their first IPC Congress. The changes normalized the CNPC's relationship with the International Paralympic Committee, and the country's athletes were then eligible to compete in some competitions because of the Paralympic Solidarity program.\n\nThe CNPC developed a strategic plan for period of 2013 to 2016. This plan was designed to prepare the country for the 2016 Summer Paralympics. It had seven major objectives. These included improving organizational structure, developing human and institutional resources, sustaining and improving para-sports physical infrastructure and sporting equipment, increase awareness of para-sports, creating athlete development pathways, and ensure Cameroonian participation in national and international events.\n\nThe NPC had their first website in 2012 as part of efforts by the International Paralympic Committee to increase the digital presence for its member nations. This website was designed with the goal of providing information for sportspeople on the local level all the way up to the elite level of Paralympic sport in Cameroon. The website was in French. In December 2012, the NPC participated in an athletics (track and field) training seminar organized by the IPC in Dakar, Senegal for French speaking African countries. Jean-Marie Aléokol Mabiemé co-wrote a guide called, \"Guide du Sport pour Personne vivant avec un Handicap\". In 2014, he was a trainer at a CONFEJES event in Yaoundé organized by the Ministry of Sports and Physical Education and the Paralympic Committee of Cameroon. Twenty sports administrators from four Central African countries participated in the conference.\n\nIn 2014, the NPC hosted a capacity building workshop in coordination with the IPC Academy. Capacity building inside NPCs like Cameroon was part of the IPC's Strategic Plan to improve NPC capacity and efficiency in governance, management, leadership and sport promotion in member countries. Other countries that held similar workshops in 2013 and 2014 included Ghana, Cape Verde, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Liberia, Puerto Rico, Serbia, Seychelles, and Vanuatu.\n\nOne of the sources for funding of the disability sports movement in Cameroon has been Agitos Foundation grants. In 2014, the NPC received a grant to promote Paralympic Sport in the country. The NPC received a grant of €800 ahead of the Rio Games to promote Paralympic and para-sports before, during and after the Paralympic Games. This grant was part of the Organisational Capacity Programme (OCP). The money was used by Cameroon to host a come and try it event in July 2016, and used to get additional media coverage from radio and television news. In June 2016, the CNPC signed a sponsorship agreement with MACRON to provide the kit for the Cameroon team at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The CNPC viewed this historic sponsorship deal as important towards the continued professionalization of Paralympic sport in Cameroon. Success going forward in the Paralympic movement is perceived by those involved with para-sports in Cameroon as being dependent on the government for continued and increased support.\n\n\n"}

It is popular in some British secondary schools , and is also played recreationally by scouts, the Air Training Corps and by the British Navy and Australian Navy. It is also a popular sport at U.S. summer camps.\n\nDanish Longball can be described as a hybrid of baseball and cricket. There is a modern variant that is based on football too. Each team takes turns batting and fielding. In British secondary schools in particular, an element of dodgeball is incorporated, with a player being \"out\" if he or she is hit with the ball (outside the safety zone) below the head whilst aiming to get a run.\n\nPlayers are split into two teams, a batting team and a balling team. The batting team waits behind the batting goal ready to bat. The balling team is spread behind the batting goal and the safe goal ready to field.\n\nThe batting field has two parts: Inside and outside a square (or circle). Fielders can position themselves inside or outside the square. The fielder who fields the ball cannot move with it rather they must pass it to another fielder in a better position to hit the runner.\n\n\nThe bowler pitches the ball to the batter, who must use their bat to hit the ball. The ball must be hit within the field of play – the square. The ball must hit the ground at least once before it bounces or rolls off the field. The batter must then run to the other side of the square to a \"safe zone\". The runner may rest in safety, but to earn a \"run\" they must make it safely back to the original side of the square without getting out. Each side bats its entire line-up. Five rounds of play are recommended.\n\nWhen played in Britain it is usually an alternative to Cricket, so timed innings may be used along with a set of stumps (though usually not a cricket ball, as the risk of injury is significantly raised rather than a tennis ball).\n\nA player is out if \n\nA variant of the above is sometimes used: if a fielder hits a runner with the ball outside the safe-zones then the entire batting team is out.\n\nThe winning team is the one that scores the most runs.\n"}

It was the breakthrough play for its writer, Greg McGee, and was initially workshopped at the New Zealand Playwrights' Conference in Wellington in 1980, and has since become a staple of New Zealand theatre. Being produced as it was immediately before and during the social unrest of the 1981 Springbok Tour of New Zealand, it hit a nerve with the public and was named Best New Zealand Play of 1981.\n\nThe play is a drama set in a rugby union changing room after a practice, and at an after-match party. The captain is kicked in the head off-stage at the beginning of the first act, and again during the game between acts. He dies in hospital during the second act. The theme is the conflict between fair play and winning at all costs, and the non-conformist lead character Foreskin's struggle to reconcile his university liberal values with those of his rugby-playing conservative mates. The play ends with Foreskin directly addressing the audience in a monologue - or rather interrogation - filled with rugby allusions, questioning their own values, ending with the repeated question, \"Whaddarya?\" (usually used in New Zealand to question someone's masculinity). Early performances left audiences in stunned silence. In some productions Foreskin undresses during the lament and finishes nude.\n\nIn New Zealand a rugby union player is an everyman, and the game and play present a model of society. Set in 1976, it looks forward to the 1981 Springbok Tour. It has been suggested the misnamed character \"Clean\" was based on Rob Muldoon. The script was updated after the 1981 tour and was later heavily revised by the author for filming as \"Skin and Bones\".\n\n"}

With sponsors becoming more important with the rising costs in Formula One, many teams wanted to be able to display the logos of their sponsors as clearly as possible.\n\nThe liveries are usually changed for every season in the sport, marking the marketing ideas of the sponsors. Many teams keep some consistency over the years however, like the red colour of Ferrari, which has its origin in a shade of red known as rosso corsa being the national racing colour of Italy. Tobacco and alcohol advertising was common in motorsport, however as bans spread throughout the world teams used an alternate livery which alluded to the tobacco or alcohol sponsor, or entirely eliminated their name when in nations with a ban – this is now only seen on Ferrari's Marlboro sponsored vehicles – where the sponsor is technically banned from advertising in all host nations. At historical events, cars are allowed to use the livery which was used when the car was actively competing.\n\nAutomobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives (AGS) were founded in Gonfaron, France, in the late 1960s, but only entered Formula One in 1986.\n\nAlfa Romeo was a Formula One constructor between 1950 and 1951, and again between 1979 and 1985. In 1950–1951 and 1979 the team used the rosso corsa (racing red) national color of Italy. In 1980 they switched to a livery sponsored by Phillip Morris' Marlboro cigarette brand. In 1984 the Italian clothing brand Benetton took over Alfa Romeo's livery sponsorship, which they held until the withdrawal of Alfa Romeo from Formula One at the end of 1985.\n\nStarting in the 1970s and going for decades until ending in mid-2002, Arrows, that was known as Footwork for a few years in the 1990s, had quite distinctive liveries, like the unusual Ruffles sponsorship in Footwork, an all-black car in the 1998 season, and an orange car in its final years.\n\nBenetton Formula Ltd., commonly referred to simply as Benetton, was a Formula One constructor that participated from 1986 to 2001. The team was owned by the Benetton family who run a worldwide chain of clothing stores of the same name. In 2000 the team was purchased by Renault, but competed as Benetton for the 2001 season. In 2002 the team became Renault F1. From the 1991 to 1993, Camel sponsored the Benetton team, but, from the 1994 to 2001 the main sponsor was Mild Seven.\n\nIn its Dallara years, Scuderia Italia raced with a livery slightly similar to Ferrari (rosso corsa with white details and black wings), but prior to the absorption by Minardi in 1993, when raced with Lola cars, had a white livery with red and yellow flames.\n\nAfter having been an engine supplier in the 1980s and again since 2000, BMW entered Formula One with a works team of its own in 2006 after buying the Swiss Formula One constructor Sauber. Although the cars had many sponsorship logos on them, the main pattern was based on the traditional BMW Motorsport team colours of white with light blue, dark blue and a little red (in an almost purple shade). White is also the original national racing colour of Germany, while white and blue are the colours of Bavaria and of BMW itself.\n\nOn 27 November 2009, BMW agreed to sell the team back to its original founder, Peter Sauber. The 2010 Formula One season marked Sauber's return as an independent constructor.\n\nPrior to sponsorships, Brabham raced in turquoise with a gold band running across the car. This later changed to green and gold, the racing colours of Australia. In 1975 and 1976, Brabham received sponsorship from Martini; in 1976 the color scheme changed from white to red with light blue trim. The primary sponsor changed to Parmalat in 1978, with the cars retaining a variant of the same red and blue colors. With the team's switch to BMW engines in 1982, the new livery consisted of a clean dark blue and white with a stylized BMW \"kidney grille\" on the nose. This scheme was retained throughout the BMW years, even through a sponsorship change to Olivetti in 1984, until 1989. (This unusual representation of the engine supplier, specifically BMW, in the color scheme was revived by Williams when they debuted their own BMW cars in 2000.) In 1989, Brabham signed with Bioptron, a brand of Zepter International, which continued until the team was bought by Middlebridge Group. Since then, it was sponsored by many Japanese companies like Garage Italiya, a company that imports Italian cars in Japan, Autobacs, Nippon Shinpan, and Mitsukoshi. Prior the swansong of Brabham in 1992, the team raced in blue and pink livery of the Japanese metal group Seikima-II. \n\nAfter Honda pulled out of F1 at the end of 2008, team boss Ross Brawn struggled to find a buyer to save the team, eventually buying it himself. A lack of sponsors resulted in the white livery, with flashes of bright yellow and black. Towards the end of the season, the team arranged one-race sponsor deals with a variety of major local companies, including Canon, Mapfre, Itaipava and Qtel.\n\nBrawn GP dominated the early part of the 2009 season, with Jenson Button winning six of the first seven races. As other teams improved their cars Brawn struggled for pace, but still recorded several podiums during the rest of the year. Their strong start and consistent finish was enough to secure the Constructors World Championship at the first (and only) attempt, as well as the drivers title with Jenson Button. At the end of the season, the team was purchased by engine suppliers Mercedes-Benz, marking the return of the Silver Arrows after 55 years.\n\nBritish American Racing competed in Formula One from 1999 to 2005. The name of the team was taken from British American Tobacco which provided the main sponsorship and was livery sponsor through two of its main cigarette brands. In their debut season, the team wished to have its two cars painted in different liveries (one 555, the other Lucky Strike), but this was forbidden by the rules. So the team decided on a unique two-sided design, with the blue 555 livery of the right side of the car, and the red and white Luckies livery on the left and a zipper design on the middle.\n\nThe Lotus team, which made its début in 2010, was renamed to Caterham F1 in . It was formally from Malaysia but still had a livery dominated by British racing green, like the old Lotus team had for many years.\n\nIn its first years, Coloni was sponsored by and , two subsidiary companies of Montedison\n\nIn keeping with their Italian roots, Ferrari has always kept a red colour in the tradition of rosso corsa, the national racing colour of Italy, except for two races in 1964 when Enzo Ferrari let his cars enter by NART in American blue and white colours to protest against Italian racing authorities. Over the years, rosso corsa has been combined with white parts and with various sponsorship schemes, but Ferrari has never fully let their cars be dominated by the sponsorship livery like many other teams have. This changed in the 1990s when Ferrari replaced their traditional rosso corsa colour with a \"Marlboro red\" which is noticeably lighter; this colour remains despite the ban on tobacco sponsorship.\n\nHaas entered Formula One in 2016.\n\nThe Embassy Hill, founded by two-time World Champion Graham Hill, raced during the 1975 season with Imperial Tobacco's Embassy brand as title sponsor. The cars were predominantly white, with a red vertical stripe behind the cockpit. The team folded following the aircraft accident in which Hill, driver Tony Brise and four other team members were killed in November 1975.\n\nHonda first raced in Formula One from 1964 to 1968. The cars were entered in an all-white livery with a red circle, duplicating the Japanese flag. The company won several races but left F1 at the end of the 1968 season, before returning as an engine supplier in the 1980s. Honda in the 1990s never raced, but created prototypes like the RC 100 and the RA099 tested at Suzuka Circuit.\nAfter a decade away from the sport, Honda returned again as an engine supplier in 2001, before buying the British American Racing team and entering F1 as a constructor in 2006.\nFor the 2006 season, Honda continued with the BAT sponsorship with the Lucky Strike logo, but BAT pulled out for 2007. From 2007, the only logos on the car are the Honda badge, the Bridgestone logo, and the logo of Honda's environmental awareness program, Earth Dreams. For 2007, the livery itself was a picture of the Earth on a black background. For 2008, however, there are only pieces of the image of Earth on a mainly white background, as opposed to the whole of the Earth being on Honda's car.\n\nThe HRT Formula 1 Team competed for just three seasons, between 2010 and 2012. In that time, the team competed with three different liveries, this was due to a lack of sponsor continuity.\n\nJaguar used green to reflect its British nationality, just like British teams in the first decades of Formula One all used British racing green.\n\nJordan Grand Prix competed in Formula One from –. In 1991–1995 it featured green, the colour of Ireland. During 1997–2005, they were known for their distinctive bright yellow livery.\n\nLEC was a Formula One team and constructor from the United Kingdom. They participated in ten Grands Prix, using a March in 1973. In 1977 they built their own car, the LEC CRP1.\n\nLigier always raced with a Bleu de France or Blue Livery, with red, black or white parts\n\nAt the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix the Lotus became the second team (after Team Gunston at the 1968 South African Grand Prix) to abandon the national colour system when the possibility to do so was created in . Lotus also had one of the longest sponsorship cooperations in Formula One history, making the black and gold of its 1972–1986 John Player Special seasons one of the best known liveries to this day.\n\nThe new Lotus team made its début in 2010 and was renamed to Caterham F1 in 2012. It was formally from Malaysia but still had a livery dominated by British racing green, like the old Lotus team had for many years.\n\nThe Renault team was renamed to Lotus in 2012, following an agreement with Caterham F1. The team is owned by Luxembourg-based venture capital group Genii Capital and named after its branding partner Group Lotus. Its livery, introduced back in 2011 with Renault R31, was designed as a tribute to the Team Lotus cars of 1981–1986 and their famous John Player Special liveries.\n\nManor entered Formula One in 2016 after being renamed from Marussia.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the works March team (March Engineering) often ran different sponsorship liveries on individual cars, under multiple entrant names.\n\nMarussia entered Formula One in after Virgin Racing was renamed. The team was renamed as Manor in .\n\nExtremely short lived team, the team folded after failing to qualify in the opening race.\n\nMcLaren had one of the longest sponsorship deals in F1 history with Marlboro, whose red-and-white pattern appeared on the team's cars for 23 straight years.\n\nMercedes-Benz first competed in Formula One during the and seasons. This was in the time before sponsorship liveries and the team was using an all silver livery, the national racing color of Germany. The team was absent from Formula One after this, returning in as an engine supplier.\n\nMercedes-Benz rejoined Formula One as a team in after having purchased the Brawn GP team on 16 November 2009. On 21 December 2009 it signed a €30 million per season contract with Petronas as\n\"title sponsor\". On 25 January 2010 Mercedes GP unveiled the car livery for the 2010 season. The blueish green livery color of Petronas is just present as fine lines at the side of the car, which overall is mainly painted in silver like the old time Mercedes race cars of the 1930s and 1950s.\n\nMidland F1 competed for only one year, 2006. They took over Jordan in 2005, but Midland sold it in late 2006 to Spyker. They were the first F1 team to compete with a Russian license. (After Spyker's takeover in mid-2006, the team changed its livery to orange and name to Spyker MF1 Racing. In 2007, the team competed as Spyker F1.)\n\nAs the longest lasting Formula 1 backrunners, Minardi had an enormous variety of sponsors during its 21 seasons, but still managed to have a predominantly black painted car most of the time.\n\nPenske entered the Formula One World Championship from to and maintained its livery and sponsors throughout its three seasons in F1.\n\nProst competed in Formula One for five seasons, with similar liveries in each season, despite changing sponsors.\n\nRebaque is the only Mexican team in F1 to date. Named after its driver Héctor Rebaque, it always raced with a brown and gold livery.\n\nJaguar Racing was renamed Red Bull Racing after the former was bought from Ford on 15 November 2004 by the energy drink company. Red Bull's involvement in Formula One dates back to , when it first sponsored the Sauber team. The deal with Sauber lasted until the end of the season.\n\nSince its first season in the car livery did not change much, always keeping Red Bull as the main sponsor. This changed in 2013, when Infiniti became the team's title sponsor and Red Bull's branding on the car was reduced.\n\nRed Bull have used special liveries on multiple occasions, supporting the release up upcoming films and company's charity program Wings for Life.\n\nRenault entered Formula One in 1977 and withdrew as a team after the 1985 season. Renault returned to Formula One in 2002 by buying the Benetton team. Renault had a contract with Mild Seven from 2002 to 2006, and had a title contract with ING Group from 2007 to Italian Grand Prix 2009 when ING withdrew all association with Renault. The team was later sold and became Lotus in 2012, before Renault bought back the team and returned as a constructor in .\n\nSauber is a Swiss Formula One constructor that joined the Formula One grid in 1993. At the end of the 2005 season it was bought by BMW and from 2006 to 2009 it raced as BMW Sauber F1 Team. On 27 November 2009, BMW agreed to sell the team back to its original founder, Peter Sauber. The 2010 Formula One season marked Sauber's return as an independent constructor.\n\nSpyker took part in only one season of Formula One. The main colour of the car did not directly reflect the sponsorships but was the orange racing colour of the Netherlands.\n\nStewart lasted for only 3 years before being bought out by its engine supplier, Ford, and being rebranded as Jaguar, but managed to win a race in its final season, 1999. Stewart had a tartan decoration on its cars to represent its Scottish nationality.\n\nSuper Aguri was set up before the 2006 season by Aguri Suzuki, with the help of Honda Racing, to provide a drive for former Honda driver Takuma Sato. For the 2006 season's SA05 and SA06, their car was based on the 2002 Arrows A23, after which, for the 2007 and 2008 seasons, they ran cars based on the previous year's Honda chassis.\n\nToro Rosso is the sister team of Red Bull Racing. Since it originated from the buyout of Minardi, its name means Red Bull in Italian. At the beginning, the team used to have the same name and sponsors as its parent team, with the major difference being the presence of a scarlet \"charging bull\" painted over the engine cowling.\n\nWhen car manufacturers started to concentrate in their own F1 teams at the start of the decade, Toyota was one of them. As main rival Honda did, they always painted their cars with the same white/red color scheme, instead of any sponsor colors.\n\nTyrrell Racing competed in Formula One from –. Its traditional colour was blue and white, or a combination as such, for most of the 1970s and 1980s. The cars were more white during the mid to late 1990s.\n\nThe Virgin Group's involvement with Formula One started in when they decided to sponsor Brawn GP for that season. On 30 November 2009 it was reported that the Manor GP, one of the four newcomers teams for the season, would be rebranded as Virgin Racing.\n\nWilliams, as a major constructor, is rare in modern F1 in that they have no manufacturer backing. Over the years, their supply of engines and other major components has often changed, meaning that their livery is renewed more often than most of their rivals. Sponsors of Williams can often have the livery dramatically changed, which has helped to keep Williams competitively financed since 1978, when Williams first entered as a constructor. The BMW-engined Williams cars from 2001-2006 featured a dark blue and white scheme with stylized BMW \"kidney grille\", which resembled Brabham's BMW-engined cars from the 1980s.\n"}

{"id": "2423238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2423238", "title": "Howard Head", "text": "Howard Head\n\nHoward Head (July 31, 1914 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – March 3, 1991) was an aeronautical engineer who is credited with the invention of the first commercially successful aluminum laminate skis and the oversized tennis racket. Head founded the ski (and later tennis racquet) making firm Head in 1950. Later he became chairman of Prince Manufacturing Inc. The U.S. patents for the laminate skis and oversized tennis racket are in the name of Howard Head.\n\nIn 1947, Howard Head was an aircraft engineer for Glenn L. Martin Company in Baltimore, and went skiing for the first time. Head was frustrated with the quality of the clumsy and heavy wooden skis, which made skiing very difficult for beginners. He decided to develop a lighter and more efficient ski that could make skiing much easier for everyone. He left his job and devoted all his time and energy to developing the skis and supported himself with earnings from poker.\n\nThe skis developed by Head were based on the structural principles that he had learned during his experience as an aircraft engineer. In a warehouse he rented from Albert Gunther Inc in an alley off of Biddle Street in downtown Baltimore, he used a technique known as metal sandwich construction. The first skis he made consisted of two light layers of aluminum bonded to sidewalls of thin plywood, with a center filling of honeycomb plastic. Although these skis were very light, they all broke quite quickly during trials. Head did not give up on his idea, and was encouraged by several professional skiers, including 1939 World Champion Emile Allais and ski instructors Clif Taylor and Neil Robinson, who assured Head that he would love to use his skis if they did not break. Throughout that winter Head would make a ski pair and send it out to Robinson, who returned it to Head after it broke. Head figured out the flaws of his design, came up with modifications, sent the new ski pair to Robinson, and the process repeated. By the end of the winter of 1947, Head came up with skis that were as strong as wooden skis but were half the weight.\n\nIn order to make his skis more efficient, Head made several other changes, like substituting plywood for honeycomb plastic, covering the bottom of the ski with polyethylene to avoid the problem of icy bottoms and adopting continuous steel edges to harden the edges of the ski. The new improved skis were almost as heavy as the conventional wooden skis, but were stronger and easier to control. Head skis helped to popularize alpine skiing in the U.S.; the innovative equipment made turning significantly easier.\n\nIn 1950, Head founded the Head Ski Company, which became very successful. Within a couple of years it was the major supplier of alpine skis in the U.S. and influenced ski design worldwide. The company later diversified into tennis and other racquet sports; its most notable product was the innovative Arthur Ashe racquet, constructed of aluminum honeycomb. Howard Head sold the company to AMF in 1969 and retired. After a number of takeovers and acquisitions, HEAD, N.V. is currently based in Kennelbach, Austria (operational) and Amsterdam, Netherlands (corporate offices).\n\nAfter retiring, Head decided to take tennis lessons and for this purpose he got himself a tennis ball machine, which was manufactured by Prince Manufacturing Inc. Although Howard was not very good at tennis, he figured out that the equipment for the game needed a lot of improvement or he was going to need a lot more practice. To begin with he became the majority shareholder and chairman of the board of Prince. While Head considerably improved the design of the ball machine, he still did not get any better at the game. He figured it out that it was because of the small sweet-spot of the tennis racquet. In order to make the game of tennis easier, Head came up with the design of oversized racquet. He filed and obtained a patent that covered tennis racquets with size 95–135 square inches. He also pioneered the development of the graphite racquet, which eventually became the industry standard, replacing wooden racquets.\n\nAlthough Prince was the first company to patent oversize racquets, the Bentley Fortissimo preceded the patent by two years, causing Germany to invalidate it. Weed also introduced an oversize racquet in 1975, before the first Prince oversize, the aluminum Prince Classic, was introduced.\n\n"}

The game, which was broadcast on television nationally on \"Thursday Night Football\", was played at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan during the 2015 NFL season. On the final play of regulation, with no time remaining on the game clock, Packers quarterback (QB) Aaron Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass into the end-zone that was caught by tight end (TE) Richard Rodgers for the game-winning touchdown.\n\nThe play resulted in a dramatic 27–23 come-from-behind victory for the Packers, who had trailed 20–0 in the second half. The victory was the Packers fourth-largest comeback in franchise history. It was also the start of a 3–game winning streak that would help the Packers clinch their seventh consecutive postseason berth. The Lions would end the season with a record of 7–9 and fail to reach the playoffs.\n\nBefore the game on December 3, 2015, the Green Bay Packers had struggled in their previous games, while the Detroit Lions had found their form since winning against the Packers on the road at Lambeau Field in Green Bay. The Packers had lost four of their last five games after a 6–0 start for the season and were in dire need of a change of fortune to reach the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions came to the game with a three-game winning streak, and they still had a chance to earn a playoff spot despite starting the season with a 1-7 record.\n\nEighteen days earlier, the Lions had ended a 24-year winless streak against the Packers in a road game by beating them 18–16 at Lambeau Field. If they had also defeated the Packers at their second meeting of the season, the Lions would have swept the season series with Green Bay for the first time since 1991.\n\nBefore the Packers started their comeback from the 20–0 deficit in the second half of the game, the Lions had snapped a 56-game streak during which the Packers had scored in the first half. Counting the previous game against the Chicago Bears and the greater part of the Lions game, Packers went nearly 70 game-minutes without scoring a point.\n\nWith six seconds left on the game clock, Green Bay was on 3rd-and-10 at its own 21-yard line. After one forward pass and one backward pass, Packers tight end Richard Rodgers lateraled the ball to quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was quickly tackled at his 24-yard line by Detroit Lions defender Devin Taylor, with the game clock having gone to zero during the play. However, the official standing behind the play called a 15-yard penalty on Taylor for a face mask foul on the tackle, and so, because NFL rules state that a game cannot end on a defensive penalty, the Packers were given an untimed play at their own 39-yard line.\n\nAfter the snap, all Packers receivers ran towards the end zone and Aaron Rodgers broke right, escaping the Detroit defenders before throwing a Hail Mary pass into the end zone.<ref name=\"nantz/simms\"></ref> Tight end Richard Rodgers, who was the last player to reach the end zone, leapt high in front of all defenders, caught the ball at full extension, and came down nearly unchallenged for the catch, resulting in the Packers winning 27–23 (the Packers chose to omit the extra-point attempt). According to a number of estimations, Aaron Rodgers' pass traveled before reaching the hands of Richard Rodgers. The throw was also high enough to nearly hit the rafters at Ford Field. The comeback victory was the fourth-largest in franchise history.\n\nQB Aaron Rodgers and TE Richard Rodgers are not related, but both attended University of California, Berkeley and played for the California Golden Bears, graduating in 2005 and 2014, respectively.\n\nThe play was Aaron Rodgers' first ever completed Hail Mary pass of his career, just one day after his 32nd birthday.\n\nThe Packers TE Richard Rodgers is the son of Richard Rodgers Sr., who was involved in one of the most famous plays in American football, \"The Play\", that ended the game between Cal and Stanford in 1982. Richard Rodgers Sr. contended after the game that his son's role in the play rivaled his involvement in the famous play which he called and in which he threw two of the five laterals in 1982:\n\nLike most significant calls by officials, the face mask penalty against Detroit that led to the winning play by Green Bay generated controversy. Dean Blandino, NFL Vice President of Officiating, responded to the call on Twitter moments after the game:\nDuring a visit by NFL officials to a Lions training camp in 2016, Carl Cheffers, the official who threw the flag, was asked about the penalty; he said \"I think it was an illegal tackle. Horse-collar, facemask, I think it was an illegal tackle. I’m very comfortable with it.\"\n\nThe nickname for the play, \"Miracle in Motown\", was first used by Jim Nantz during the nationally broadcast \"Thursday Night Football\" postgame show.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "632990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=632990", "title": "Pranayama", "text": "Pranayama\n\nPrāṇāyāma is a Sanskrit word alternatively translated as \"extension of the \"prāṇa\" (breath or life force)\" or \"breath control.\" The word is composed from two Sanskrit words: \"prana\" meaning life force (noted particularly as the breath), and either \"ayama\" (to restrain or control the prana, implying a set of breathing techniques where the breath is intentionally altered in order to produce specific results) or the negative form \"ayāma\", meaning to extend or draw out (as in extension of the life force). It is a yogic discipline with origins in ancient India.\n\n\"Prāṇāyāma\" (Devanagari: \"\") is a Sanskrit compound.\n\nV. S. Apte provides fourteen different meanings for the word \"prāṇa\" (Devanagari: , \"\") including these:\n\n\nOf these meanings, the concept of \"vital air\" is used by Bhattacharyya to describe the concept as used in Sanskrit texts dealing with prāṇāyāma. Thomas McEvilley translates \"prāṇa\" as \"spirit-energy\". The breath is understood to be its most subtle material form, but is also believed to be present in the blood, and most concentrated in men's semen and women's vaginal fluid.\n\nMonier-Williams defines the compound ' as \"(m., also pl.) N. of the three 'breath-exercises' performed during (\"See\" ', ', '\". This technical definition refers to a particular system of breath control with three processes as explained by Bhattacharyya: ' (to take the breath inside), ' (to retain it), and \"\" (to discharge it). There are also other processes of prāṇāyāma in addition to this three-step model.\n\nMacdonell gives the etymology as ' + \"āyāma\" and defines it as \"\"m.\" suspension of breath (\"sts. pl.\")\".\n\nApte's definition of ' derives it from ' + ' and provides several variant meanings for it when used in compounds. The first three meanings have to do with \"length\", \"expansion, extension\", and \"stretching, extending\", but in the specific case of use in the compound ' he defines \"\" as meaning \"restrain, control, stopping\".\n\nAn alternative etymology for the compound is cited by Ramamurti Mishra, who says that:\n\nPrāṇāyāma is mentioned in verse 4.29 of the Bhagavad Gītā.\n\nAccording to Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is, \"prāṇāyāma\" is translated to \"trance induced by stopping all breathing\", also being made from the two separate Sanskrit words, \"prāṇa\" and \"āyām\".\n\nPranayama is the fourth \"limb\" of the eight limbs of Ashtanga Yoga mentioned in verse 2.29 in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Patanjali, a Hindu Rishi, discusses his specific approach to pranayama in verses 2.49 through 2.51, and devotes verses 2.52 and 2.53 to explaining the benefits of the practice. Patanjali does not fully elucidate the nature of prana, and the theory and practice of pranayama seem to have undergone significant development after him. He presents pranayama as essentially an exercise that is preliminary to concentration, as do the earlier Buddhist texts.\n\nMany yoga teachers advise that pranayama should be part of an overall practice that includes the other limbs of Patanjali's Raja Yoga teachings, especially Yama, Niyama, and Asana.\n\nThe Indian tradition of Hatha Yoga makes use of various pranayama techniques. The 15th century Hatha Yoga Pradipika is a key text of this tradition and includes various forms of pranayama such as breath retention techniques termed Kumbhaka and various body locks (Bandha). Other forms of pranayama breathing include Ujjayi breath (\"Victorious Breath\"), Bhastrika (\"bellows breath\") and Kapalabhati (\"skull shining breath\").\n\nMany of these practices have become popular in Western forms of Yoga.\n\nAccording to the Pali Buddhist Canon, the Buddha prior to his enlightenment practiced a meditative technique which involved pressing the palate with the tongue and forcibly attempting to restrain the breath. This is described as both extremely painful and not conducive to enlightenment. According to the Buddhist scheme, breathing stops with the fourth jhana, though this is a side-effect of the technique and does not come about as the result of purposeful effort.\n\nThe Buddha did incorporate moderate modulation of the length of breath as part of the preliminary tetrad in the Anapanasati Sutta. Its use there is preparation for concentration. According to commentarial literature, this is appropriate for beginners.\n\nLater Indo-Tibetan developments in Buddhist pranayama which are similar to Hindu forms can be seen as early as the 11th century, in the Buddhist text titled the \"Amṛtasiddhi\", which teaches three bandhas for kumbakha.\n\nThese developments continued in Tibetan Buddhism which includes its own forms of pranayama exercises termed Tsa-lung (Skt: nadi-vayu) usually incorporated into a system of yogic practice such as Trul khor or into the full Tantric systems of various Buddhist Tantras such as the Six Yogas of Naropa of the Cakrasamvara tradition. Tibetan Buddhist breathing exercises such as the \"nine breathings of purification\" or the \"Ninefold Expulsion of Stale Vital Energy\" (\"rlung ro dgu shrugs\"), a form of alternate nostril breathing, commonly include visualizations.\n\nIn the Nyingma tradition of Dzogchen these practices are collected in the textual cycle known as \"The Oral Transmission of Vairotsana\" (\"Vai ro snyan brgyud\").\n\nSeveral researchers have reported that pranayama techniques are beneficial in treating a range of stress-related disorders. A Cochrane systematic review on the symptomatic relief of asthma by breathing exercises did not find a statistically significant improvement but did find that there was a statistically significant increase in the dose of histamine needed to provoke a 20% reduction in FEV1 (PD20) during pranayama breathing but not with the placebo device.\n\nAuthoritative texts on Yoga state that, in order to avoid injuries and unwanted side effects, pranayama should only be undertaken when one has a firmly established yoga practice and then only under the guidance of an experienced Guru. Although relatively safe, Hatha Yoga is not risk free. Sensible precautions can usefully be taken such as beginners should avoid advanced moves if they have any physical health related issue. It can get dangerous if someone is trying to pose tough exercise which requires extreme flexibility and good shapes of bones. Hatha Yoga should not be combined with psychoactive drug use, and competitive Hatha Yoga should be avoided. Person should inform the teacher or trainer of their physical limitations and concerns before getting involved themselves for extreme pose positions. Functional limitations should be taken into consideration. Modifications can then be made using props, altering the duration or poses.\n\nAccording to at least one study, pranayama was the yoga practice leading to most injuries, with four injuries in a study of 76 practitioners. There have been limited reports of adverse effects including haematoma and pneumothorax, though the connections are not always well established.\n"}

{"id": "11492275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11492275", "title": "WHL Bantam Draft", "text": "WHL Bantam Draft\n\nThe WHL Bantam Draft is an annual outing, in which the teams of the Western Hockey League select players who have graduated from bantam. The draft's order of selection depends on where the team finishes in the league standings. The teams that miss the playoffs are placed into a lottery for the 1st round only. After the 1st round, the teams select in order from fewest to most regular season points.\n\nYears ago, WHL teams were allowed to list first-year bantam players as of a set date in September. However, first-year bantams had been playing at the peewee level the previous year, and to list first-year bantams, WHL teams needed to scout the peewee ranks. This had many drawbacks including the need for extensive scouting systems along with the related expense, as well the added pressure on peewee-aged players (12- and 13-year-olds).\n\nTo get away from scouting peewees, the WHL instituted a bantam draft. WHL teams send scouts to watch second-year bantams from the start of the minor hockey season. After the season, the WHL holds a draft specifically to allow teams to add bantam players in an orderly manner to their protected lists. While this draft is the first opportunity for teams to select bantam players, it is not the last chance for a player to be listed. After the draft is completed, all the remaining bantams become eligible to be listed by teams, and many will be added as spots become available on team's PPLs, or as a player's talents improve or are more noticeable at a later date or at a higher level of hockey.\n\nDuring the bantam draft (typically held in early May), players from the four Western Provinces and the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming are eligible to be selected.\n\nPlayers from non-North American countries are allowed to be added in the CHL Import Draft which is held in June.\n\nA team is allowed to add up to 50 players between the ages of 14 and 20 onto its PPL. 14-year-olds may not be added to the list until the Bantam Draft has been completed following their final year at the bantam level.\n\nThe 50 Player Protected List is used by the Western Hockey League to ensure there is a method of organization and control in the League for the rights to players. Without this type of built-in control, the system would be problematic.\n\nThe 50 Player Protected List works in a very simple manner. Each WHL team is permitted to place a maximum of 50 players between the ages of 14 and 20 on their List. A player may not be added to a WHL List until he has been eligible for the WHL Bantam Draft, which occurs following his final season of bantam hockey.\n\nAll players on a WHL team's roster are required to be on the 50 Player Protected List, so if a WHL team is carrying 23 players, this leaves only 27 spots available for future prospects. Needless to say, only the elite players will be represented on a team's List. If a player on the List no longer meets the expectations of the team, he will be replaced by another prospect. As a result, the List is constantly changing as teams evaluate their players and make adjustments. Teams are permitted to make changes to their 50 Player List throughout the entire year.\n\nIt is imperative for a team to build their List with quality players if they wish to be competitive in the future. By limiting each team's List to 50 players, this ensures that the talent level will be consistent throughout the WHL, while still rewarding the teams who do the best job in scouting talent.\n\nWith only 50 available spots, this means that decisions must be made carefully so as to ensure the team's future viability. Depending on circumstances, a player may be added or removed from a team's List at any time.\n\nAlthough many players are added to WHL team Lists during the Bantam Draft, there are also numerous situations where players develop later and are listed at that time. The following WHL stars were not selected in the WHL Bantam Draft but were added to a WHL team's list at a later date: Jarome Iginla, Darcy Tucker, Jeff Friesen, Dan Hamhuis, Scottie Upshall, Joffrey Lupul, Jeff Woywitka, Brendan Witt and Shane Doan.\n\nA player who is on a WHL team's List may not play for another WHL team, or attend another WHL team's training camp or rookie camp. However, being a member of a WHL team's 50 Player Protected List does not restrict a player from playing for, or attending a camp of a non-WHL team. The 50 Player Protected List is used strictly to determine which WHL team holds the player's rights.\n\nThe WHL, along with the Ontario Hockey League and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League comprise the Canadian Hockey League. Rules are in place to ensure that a player may be selected by only one league\n\nNumber one selections in the WHL Bantam Draft include:\n\n"}

There are three major hills: Townes Pass, climbing up from Stovepipe Wells; Hillcrest, climbing from Panamint Springs; and the Whitney Portal Road, which leaves the town of Lone Pine, California to climb to the Portal.\n\n\nIn addition to long distances and elevation, the temperature can play a major factor. At the start in Badwater, temperatures can routinely be as high as degrees, but the temperature quickly drops at higher altitudes. Below freezing temperatures can be encountered near the Portal at night, making temperature swings of over degrees possible in a single day.\n\nThe ride is a small event, with an average number of riders in the 50s. Riders may ride as individuals or as a team. Due to the heat, the cold, the length, the hills, the dark, and a number of other factors, it is not unusual for 25-50% of the participants not to finish.\n\nThe Whitney Classic started in 1981 as a fundraiser for Summit Adventure, a non-profit wilderness ministry in Bass Lake, California, and still serves as a major fundraiser for the organization.

Gazing balls were glass but can now be stainless steel, ceramic, or stained glass.\nUnlike hanging friendship balls or witch balls that have a loop, gazing balls have a stem so they can securely sit in a stand. Larger sizes can be made but prove difficult due to the weight of the blown glass.\n\nGazing balls originated in 13th century Venice, Italy, where they were hand-blown by skilled craftsmen.\n\nKing Ludwig II of Bavaria, sometimes referred to as Mad King Ludwig, is said to have adorned his Herrenchiemsee palace with lawn balls, however, the palace and gardens were never finished after Ludwig died in 1885. Sometime later the gardens, based on Versailles, were open to the public and visitors may have seen the 'lawn balls,' but the Victorian period was quickly coming to an end. By the 1880s and 90s the nature of English landscape was changing dramatically with William Robinson's and Gertrude Jekyll's designs. It would be difficult to say that \"Mad King Ludwig\" had much influence in the area of garden ornaments.\n\nGazing balls enjoyed a brief resurgence in popularity in the 1930s. They appear in a number of modernistic gardens of the period as a variation on the traditional sundial or birdbath centrepiece. Many of them from this period may have been made in polished metal rather than glass.\n\nTheir popularity was probably influenced by the illuminated glass globe which was the central focal point of the modernist garden shown at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, Paris, in 1925. The \"Jardin d’Eau et de Lumière\" was triangular in shape, largely consisting of tiered triangular reflecting pools and planting beds. At the center of the ensemble was an electrically propelled and internally illuminated sphere of stained glass. \"The mirror globe turning slowly to reflect lights is rather a night-club trick than a serious attempt at garden decoration. But it is completely successful in focusing the interest and relieving, by its unexpected location, what would otherwise be an altogether stiff pattern.\" \nOther modernist garden designs followed, using plain metal or glass mirror globes; notable examples included several roof top gardens developed by Department Stores in London, America and Australia. \n\nThe gazing ball suited the geometric clean lines of the Art Deco style especially the visual connection with the chrome plating which was part of the Streamline-moderne aesthetic of the 1930s and 1940s - so much so in fact that they became identified in many people’s minds as an invention of the 1930s. \n\nSubsequently many people in the 1950s and afterwards viewed them as a bit tacky; an example of prosaic suburban taste of the interwar period on a level with garden gnomes - they have never quite regained status.\n\n"}
