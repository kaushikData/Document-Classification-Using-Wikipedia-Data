{"id": "365813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365813", "title": "2010 Commonwealth Games", "text": "2010 Commonwealth Games\n\nThe 2010 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XIX Commonwealth Games and commonly known as Delhi 2010, was an international multi-sport event that was held in Delhi, India, from 3 to 14 October 2010. A total of 6081 athletes from 71 Commonwealth nations and dependencies competed in 21 sports and 272 events, making it the largest Commonwealth Games to date. It was also the largest international multi-sport event to be staged in Delhi and India, eclipsing the Asian Games in 1951 and 1982. The opening and closing ceremonies were held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the main stadium of the event.\n\nIt was the first time that the Commonwealth Games were held in India and the second time they were held in Asia after Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998. It was also the first time a Commonwealth Republic hosted the games, second in a country not presently headed by British monarch since Malaysia in 1998. The official mascot of the Games was \"Shera\" and the official song of the Games, \"Jiyo Utho Bado Jeeto\", was composed by Academy and Grammy awardee Indian recording artist A.R. Rahman.\n\nPreparation for the Games received widespread international media attention, with criticism being levelled against the organisers for the slow pace of work, as well as issues related to security and hygiene. However, all member nations of the Commonwealth of Nations participated in the event, except Fiji, which is suspended from the Commonwealth, and Tokelau, which didn't send a team, in spite of threats of boycotts and athlete withdrawals.\n\nThe internationally acclaimed opening ceremony improved the image of the Games, and dispelled negative notions surrounding them, with many observers remarking that they began on an apprehensive note, but were an exceptional experience with a largely positive ending. The President of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, said that India had made a good foundation for a future Olympics bid, which was reiterated by the Australian Minister of Sports. Commonwealth games Federation chief Mike Fennell stated that \"Delhi delivered a fantastic Games\". Some observers accused sections of the media of bias, unfair expectations, and negative reporting.\n\nThe final medal tally was led by Australia with 78 golds and 177 most medals overall. The host nation India achieved its best performance ever at the Commonwealth Games, finishing second overall by winning 38 gold medals. England finished third with 37 gold medals.\n\nDelhi was selected as the host city of the 2010 Commonwealth Games on 14 November 2003 during the CGF General Assembly in Montego Bay, Jamaica, defeating bid from Hamilton, Canada. India's bid motto was \"New Frontiers and Friendships\".\n\nIndia shifted the balance in its favour in the second round of voting with a promise that it would provide US$100,000 to each participating country, along with air tickets, boarding, lodging and transport. The successful 2003 Afro-Asian Games held in Hyderabad was also seen as having shown that India has the resources, infrastructure and technical know-how to stage a big sporting event.\n\nDelhi bid for the 1990 and 1994 Commonwealth Games but lost to Auckland and Victoria respectively. The Hamilton bid was Canada's attempt to hold the games for the fifth time.\n\nThe organisation of 2010 Commonwealth Games was beset by delays: in January 2010, the Indian Olympic Association vice-chairman Raja Randhir Singh expressed concern that Delhi was not up to speed in forming and organising its games committee and, following a 2009 Indian Government report showing two-thirds of venues were behind schedule, Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell stated that the slow progress of preparations represented a serious risk to the event. Singh also called for a revamp of the games' organising committees: Jarnail Singh, a former Secretary of the Government of India, was appointed as the chief executive officer and Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi was appointed as head of the committee. In spite of delays and the corruption cases levied on the organisors, commentators stated that they were confident that India will successfully host the games and do so on time.\n\nAt the launch of the Queen's Baton Relay in October 2009, the Business Club of India (BCI) was formed through the partnership of the organising committee, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). The BCI was formed to both market the Games and promote Indian business interests internationally.\n\nEvents took place at 12 competition venues. A total of 20 training venues were used in the Games. Of these 20, one was used for archery; three for aquatics; two for lawn bowls; two for netball; eight for rugby sevens, including seven venues within Delhi University; two for shooting; one for squash; two for table tennis; one for weightlifting, three for wrestling and two for tennis.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games Village provided accommodation and training for athletes of the Games, and was opened from 23 September to 18 October 2010. It is located along the east bank of the River Yamuna, in proximity to competition and training venues as well as city landmarks, and is spread over an area of . Comprising five main zones—the Residential Zone, the International Zone, the Training Area, the Main Dining and the Operational Zone—the Games Village, which is a non-smoking zone, is universally accessible particularly to accommodate para-sport athletes.\n\nThere were three main non-competition venues in the Games, besides the Commonwealth Games Village (see above); namely the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee Headquarters, the Main Media Centre, and the Games Family Hotel, Hotel Ashok.\n\nThe initial total budget estimated by the Indian Olympic Association in 2003 for hosting the Games was . In 2010, however, the official total budget soon escalated to an estimated , a figure which excluded non-sports-related infrastructure development. Business Today magazine estimated that the Games cost . The 2010 Commonwealth Games were reportedly the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever. It was also the second most expensive international multi-sport event ever held in Asia, after the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.\n\nA four-lane flyway, stretch from Lodhi Road to trans-Yamuna, linking the Games Village to the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was constructed which reduced the travelling time between the village and the Stadium to six minutes.\n\nIn response to concerns over the large number of trains that pass by the Delhi metropolitan region daily, construction of road under-bridges and over-bridges along railway lines have been completed. To expand road infrastructure, flyovers, cloverleaf flyovers, and bridges were built to improve links for the Games and city in general. Road-widening projects were finished with an emphasis being placed on expanding national highways. To improve traffic flow on existing roads, plans were made to make both the inner and outer Ring roads signal free.\n\nTo support its commitment to mass transport, nine corridors have been identified and were constructed as High Capacity Bus Systems (for example, one from Ambedkar Nagar to Red Fort). Six of these corridors were expected to be operational in 2010. Additionally, The Delhi Metro was expanded to accommodate more people and boost the use of public transport during the 2010 games. The metro has extended to Gurgaon and the Noida area. For this large increase in the size of the network, Delhi Metro had deployed 14 tunnel boring machines. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) was used to tag vehicles in venue parking lots to help organise mass parking and increase security.\n\nIndira Gandhi International Airport was modernised, expanded, and upgraded. Costing nearly $1.95 billion, Terminal 3 has increased airport passenger capacity to more than 37 million passengers a year by 2010. A new runway has been constructed, allowing for more than 75 flights an hour. At more than 4400 metres long, it is one of Asia's longest. The airport has been connected to the city via a six-lane expressway (Delhi–Gurgaon Expressway) and the $580 million Delhi Airport Metro Express line.\n\nThe organisers signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United Nations Environment Programme to show the intention to host a \"sustainable games\" and to take the environment into consideration when constructing and renovating venues. Thyagaraj Stadium is intended to be a key example of environmentally considered construction.\n\nIn opposition to this intention, a number of environmental controversies arose and the adverse ecological impact of various aspects of the games have been protested by city residents. City residents filed a public interest petition to the Supreme Court of India against the felling of 'heritage' trees in the Siri Fort area to make way for Games facilities. The court appointed architect Charles Correa to assess the impact and he severely criticised the designs on ecological grounds. In spite of this, in April 2009 the Supreme Court allowed the construction on the grounds that \"much time had been lost\" and \"the damage already caused to the environment could not be undone\".\n\nThe Commonwealth Games village, located on the flood plains of the Yamuna, has also been the subject of controversies about the flouting of ecological norms. After a prolonged legal battle between city residents and the state, construction was permitted to continue on the basis of an order of the Supreme Court of India in July 2009, which held that the government had satisfied the requirements of \"due process of the law\" by issuing public notice of its intention to begin construction work in September 1999 (a date four years prior to the acceptance of Delhi's bid for the games).\n\nIn preparation for an influx of English-speaking tourists for the Games, the Delhi government implemented a program to teach English, and the necessary skills for serving tourists, to key workers—such as cab drivers, security workers, waiters, porters, and service staff. In the two years prior to the Games 2000 drivers were taught English. In addition to Delhi, the Indian Government plans to expand the program to teach people in local tourist destinations in other parts of India.\nTo facilitate hassle-free sightseeing in Delhi, Delhi Tourism undertook the launch of India's very first Hop on Hop Off bus known as HOHO DELHI, modelled on popular concept of transport facilities in Western countries. The bus, which is equipped with state-of-the-art technologies like digital video screens and GPS systems, also had trained guides who were responsible for giving information about the sites.\n\nTo prepare for the energy-usage spike during the Games and to end chronic power cuts in Delhi, the government undertook a large power-production initiative to increase power production to 7000 MW (from the current 4500 MW). To achieve this goal, the government streamlined the power distribution process, direct additional energy to Delhi, and constructed new power plants.\n\nIn addition to physical preparation, free accommodation for all athletes at the Games Village, as well as free transport and other benefits, such as a free trip to the famed Taj Mahal and a reserved lane for participants on selected highways was provided The Games Village will house over 8,000 athletes and officials for the Games. Indian states will train state police forces to handle tourist-related issues and deploy them prior to the Games. A large-scale\nconstruction and \"beautification\" project has resulted in the demolition of hundreds of homes and the displacement of city dwellers—at least 100,000 of New Delhi's 160,000 homeless people have removed from shelters, some of which have been demolished. Bamboo screens have been erected around city slums to separate visitors from the sights of the slums, a practice which human rights campaigners have deemed dishonest and immoral.\n\nThe Delhi High Court implemented a series of \"mobile courts\" to be dispatched throughout Delhi to relocate migrant beggars from Delhi streets. The mobile courts would consider each beggar on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the beggar should be sent back to his/her state of residence, or be permitted to remain in government-shelters.\n\nThe official song of the 2010 Commonwealth Games \"Jiyo Utho Bado Jeeto\" was composed and performed by the Indian musician A. R. Rahman. The song's title is based on the slogan of the games, \"Come out and play\". The song was written by Mehboob in Hindi with a sprinkling of English words. It was released on 28 August 2010. The music video, directed by Bharath Bala was released on 23 September and featured a shorter version of the song. A. R. Rahman also gave a live concert for the theme song in Gurgaon, Haryana, which was previewed on various news channels. The official video of the song has been released on YouTube. However this song was not much appreciated by the people as it was being compared with 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa's official song Waka Waka (This Time for Africa) of Shakira.\n\nThe Queen's Baton Relay began when the baton, which contains Elizabeth II's message to the athletes, left Buckingham Palace on 29 October 2009. The baton arrived at the 2010 Games opening ceremony on 3 October 2010, after visiting the other 54 nations of the Commonwealth and travelling throughout India, reaching millions of people to join in the celebrations for the Games. The baton arrived in India on 25 June 2010 through the Wagah Border crossing from Pakistan.\n\nThe baton was designed by Michael Foley, a graduate of the National Institute of Design. It is a triangular section of aluminium twisted into a helix shape and then coated with coloured soils collected from all the regions of India. The coloured soils are a first for the styling of a Queen's Baton. A jewel-encrusted box was used to house the Queen's message, which was laser-engraved onto a miniature 18 carat gold leaf—representative of the ancient Indian 'patras. The Queen's baton is ergonomically contoured for ease of use. It is high, wide at the base, and wide at the top and weighs .\n\nThe Queen's baton has a number of technological features including:\n\nThere were 71 participating nations at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. As Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth, it was banned from participating in the Games. Rwanda fielded a team for the games for the first time after becoming a Commonwealth member in 2009. The numbers of athletes from each country is shown in brackets.\nTokelau was initially expected to compete, but did not.\n\nThere were events in 21 disciplines across 17 sports for the 2010 Commonwealth Games.\n\nKabaddi was a demonstration sport at the Games.\n\nTriathlon was excluded from the games as there was no suitable location for the swimming stage. The organisers have also removed basketball, but included archery, tennis and wrestling. Cricket, although in strong demand, did not make a comeback as the Board of Control for Cricket in India were not keen on a Twenty20 tournament, and the organisers did not want a one day tournament.\n\nThe opening ceremony was held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the main stadium of the event, in New Delhi, India. It began at 19:00  (IST) on 3 October.\n\nThe opening ceremony was directed by Ganapathy Bharat, known commonly as Bharat Bala, an acclaimed Tamil film director, screenwriter and film producer based in Kodambakkam, Chennai. The ceremony featured over 8,000 performers, and lasted for two-and-a-half hours. It is estimated that 3.50 billion (US$77 million) were spent to produce the ceremony.\nThe ceremony was divided into six separate segments, each showcasing the rich, ancient and diverse cultures of India, including art, traditions, dances, music and colours. It began with a showcase of a variety of drummers from all parts of India, accompanied by seven-year-old tabla player Keshav. The countdown took place on a screen in the stadium, and was accompanied by fireworks. The centerpiece of the ceremony was the helium aerostat, which acted as a giant 360° screen for spectators. The ceremony showcased a fusion of various classical dances from all parts of India, mehendi decorations, sand paintings and yoga. The title song was performed by A R Rahman. Singer Hariharan sang the welcome song for the Games, titled \"Swagatam\", with thousands of school children.\n\nThe Prince of Wales (representing Elizabeth II as Head of the Commonwealth) and President of India Pratibha Patil officially declared the Games open. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of the host nation, India, attended the opening ceremony as well. A total of three heads of state from outside India attended the opening ceremony; two from Commonwealth nations and one from a non-Commonwealth nation. The three head of states were Mohamed Nasheed, President of the Maldives, Marcus Stephen, President of Nauru and a multiple Commonwealth gold medallist, and Albert II, Prince of Monaco, representing the International Olympic Committee. As well, Sir Anand Satyanand, the Governor General of New Zealand, attended the ceremony.\n\nThe closing ceremony featuring both Indian and Scottish performers. The closing ceremony was not as well received as the opening ceremony. The Commonwealth Games flag was handed over to representatives of Glasgow, Scotland, which hosted the XX Commonwealth Games in 2014. At the closing ceremony, the President of the Commonwealth Games Federation declared that Delhi had hosted a \"truly exceptional Games\". A day after the ceremony, Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond stated that\n\nOnly the top ten nations by medal rank are shown in this medal table. Nations are ranked first by count of gold medals, then silver medals, then bronze medals.\n\nThe official motto for the 2010 Commonwealth Games was \"Come out and play\". It was chosen to represent the invitation of the athletes from the Commonwealth member countries to participate in the games and achieve success as well as the call of the Indian people to support their country's hosting of the games.\n\nThe logo of the 2010 Commonwealth Games is an image of Chakra, India's national symbol of freedom, unity and power. The silhouette of the figures spiralling upwards from the Chakra, represents the growth of India into a vibrant nation and the games motto, Come out and play. The logo consists of six colours which are green, red, yellow, blue, purple and pink. Green represents life, energy, high spirits, the 2010 games as a green games and determination in overcoming challenges, purple represents reassurance, mystery and excitement, red represents unity, yellow represents destiny, blue represents equality while pink represents luxury and surprise.\n\nThe official mascot for the 2010 Commonwealth Games was \"Shera\", an anthropomorphised tiger. His name comes from \"Sher\", a Hindi word meaning tiger (Hindi \"Bagh\" means tiger. However, Sher is colloquially used for both lion and tiger). The logo and the look for the games were designed by Idiom Design and Consulting. There is one song for Shera also composed by the popular composer of INDIA the song contains initiative \"Shera Shera\"\n\nThe mascot Shera visited many schools across Delhi to create enthusiasm and interest for the Commonwealth Games being held.\n\nIndian Railways served as the lead partner of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Central Bank of India, Air India and NTPC Limited served as the official partners for banking, airline and power respectively. Hero Honda was the official motorcycle partner as well as the presenting partner of the Queen's Baton Relay. Tata Motors served as the vehicle transport sponsor by providing vehicles and its maintenance services during the Queen's Baton Relay. Swiss watchmaker Tissot was the official timekeeper sponsor of the games.\nOne of the aims of hosting the Commonwealth Games was to build world-class athletics infrastructure within the country, expose audiences to top-level non-cricket competition and encourage the youth to \"Come out and play\" (the official theme of the games). Building a sporting culture that looks beyond cricket is seen as an important task for a country which won its first ever individual Olympic gold medal in Beijing 2008, despite having the world's second-largest population.\n\nSebastian Coe, former Olympic gold medalist and chairman of the 2012 Summer Olympics Organising Committee, was at the stadium during the 4 × 400 m women's relay and described the audience's cheers for the racers as \"potentially the moment that could change the course of athletics in Asia, the moment that could inspire thousands of people who'd never even seen an athletics track before to get involved... To build a truly global capacity in sport, you have to take it round the world – out of your own backyard. That means taking risks and facing challenges, but it has to be done.\"\n\nGeeta Phogat became India's first female wrestler ever to win Gold at a Commonwealth Games in Delhi 2010, where she won the Gold medal (55 kg) while her sister Babita Kumari won a Silver medal (51 kg). Their story was featured in the 2016 Indian film \"Dangal\" released on December 23, 2016. Parts of the 2010 Commonwealth Games setting were rebuilt for the film. Dangal is the Hindi term for a wrestling competition. Dangal became the highest-grossing film ever at the Indian (domestic) box office on January 7, 2017 and went on to collect over ₹2000 crores (US$286 million) in box office revenues worldwide.\n\nSeveral concerns were raised over the preparations of the Games and these included excessive budget overruns, likelihood of floods in Delhi due to heavy monsoon rains, infrastructural compromise, poor living conditions at the Commonwealth Games Village, delays in construction of the main Games' venues, the withdrawal of prominent athletes, widespread corruption by officials of the Games' Organising Committee and possibility of a terrorist attack by militants.\n\nThe negative pre-event publicity and heavy security presence played in part in low spectator attendance during the initial events. However the numbers picked up as the Games progressed.\n\nThe day after the conclusion of the Games, the Indian Government announced the formation of a special committee to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement against the Organising Committee. The probe committee will be led by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India VK Shunglu. This probe will be in addition to the Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate, and Central Vigilance Commission investigations already underway. The Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh had promised in mid-August, when reports of the bungling first surfaced, that corrupt officials will be given \"severe and exemplary\" punishment after the Games. The probe committee is tasked with looking into \"all aspects of organising and conducting\" the Games, and \"to draw lessons from it.\" It was given three months to submit its report, but the report was never publicly released. The Indian Sports Ministry has directed the Organising Committee of the 2010 Commonwealth Games (led by Suresh Kalmadi), to not release any staffer from their positions till the probe committee's work is finished.\n\n\n"}

They find themselves outside drinking beer and shooting a basketball when two classmates challenge them to a game. After seeing that their opponents are very good at basketball, they say they will only play a game they picked up in the streets (while secretly inventing the rules as they play, based on both basketball and baseball). After winning, they decide to refine the rules to the game and Coop makes the first BASEketball out of a La-Z-Boy chair. Their friend, Kenny \"Squeak\" Scolari, tags along and the sport becomes very popular in the neighborhood over the next six months.\n\nBusinessman Ted Denslow meets Coop and Remer and proposes the creation of the National BASEketball League (NBL) along with numerous rules in place to prevent its decline: teams cannot switch cities, players cannot be traded, individuals cannot make money via corporate sponsorship deals, and it is completely open to anyone who wants to play, with Denslow stating that \"anyone can be a sports' hero\". Coop initially hesitates, but quickly accepts the opportunity at hand.\n\nFive years later, the NBL is in full swing with teams, fans, stadiums, and a major championship, the Denslow Cup. Denslow is owner of the Milwaukee Beers, Coop and Remer's team. During the championship game, Denslow dies from choking on a hot dog, causing Coop to miss his shot and costing the Beers the game. Denslow's will names Coop as owner of the Beers for one year on the condition that they win the next Denslow Cup; otherwise, ownership reverts to Denslow's widow Yvette. Coop declares Remer part owner of the team, and they come to meet Jenna Reed, head of the Dream Come True Foundation, and Joey, one of the children in her care and an avid fan of BASEketball.\n\nBaxter Cain, owner of the Dallas Felons, wants to remove Denslow's rules preventing monetization of the sport, but could not while Denslow was alive. However, Coop refuses to accept any changes; Cain partners with Yvette as he tries to make the Beers lose the next Denslow Cup so she will own the team.\n\nCain cuts the funding to Jenna's foundation to get Coop and Remer to adopt a clothing line; Coop is against it, but Remer agrees and becomes obsessed with his newfound status. After the semifinals, Cain informs Coop and Remer that the clothing line has been produced through child labor in Calcutta; if the public finds out, the team and Jenna's foundation will be ruined. Cain blackmails Coop and Remer into losing or forfeiting the Denslow Cup game or he will inform the public. Jenna learns about the scandal and breaks up with Coop as Coop and Remer blame each other for the predicament.\n\nWith their friendship in shambles, Coop goes to Calcutta, aiming to resolve the situation by replacing the child workers with adults. Making it back to the championship game just as it begins, Coop still blames Remer and the Beers perform abysmally; by the seventh-inning stretch, the Beers are down 16–0. Having had enough of Coop and Remer's fighting, Squeak gives the stadium a passionate speech, reminding Coop and Remer where they came from, how much they changed everyone else's lives, and what they risk losing. Moved, Coop and Remer reconcile their differences as Yvette breaks off her alliance with Cain. After shifting their focus back in the game, they are poised to win when Coop's La-Z-Boy pops. Coop is distraught until Joey brings him a new BASEketball made from a Barcalounger. After a harrowing last throw, they win the Denslow Cup. Jenna forgives Coop as Yvette makes out with Remer.\n\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dale Earnhardt, Reggie Jackson, Jim Lampley, Kenny Mayne, Tim McCarver, Pat O'Brien, Dan Patrick, Reel Big Fish, Victoria Silvstedt, and Robert Stack make cameo appearances as themselves. Greg Grunberg, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Peter Tuiasosopo also make cameos as athletes.\n\nThe soundtrack featured a bouncy ska cover of Norwegian band a-ha's signature single \"Take on Me\" by Reel Big Fish. The band also appears as the live entertainment at the home stadium of the Milwaukee Beers, playing \"Take on Me\" and several of their other songs.\n\nThe review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives \"BASEketball\" a 42% approval rating based on 50 critics (an average rating of 5 out of 10). It also garnered a score of 38 out of 100 from 18 critics on Metacritic, which indicates \"generally unfavorable reviews.\"\n\nYasmine Bleeth and Jenny McCarthy were nominated at the 1998 Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Actress and Worst Supporting Actress respectively for the movie. Bleeth lost to the Spice Girls for \"Spice World\" while McCarthy lost to Maria Pitillo for \"Godzilla\".\n\nLead actors Trey Parker and Matt Stone later went on to reference the movie's mostly negative reception in the third episode of season eight of their co-created TV show \"South Park\", \"The Passion of the Jew\", in which two of the show's main characters, Kenny McCormick and Stan Marsh (voiced by Stone and Parker, respectively), attempt to get a refund for the tickets they bought to see the Mel Gibson movie \"The Passion of the Christ\", the latter at one point telling the former \"This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible! This is just like when we got our money back for \"BASEketball\"!\"\n\nThe film is credited with coining the Internet slang term \"derp\". Trey Parker and Matt Stone later referenced the term on the third season of \"South Park\" in the episode \"The Succubus\", where Chef is replaced by Mr. Derp.\n\n\n"}

The ground was used as a first-class cricket venue by Kent County Cricket Club between 1849 and 1971. It remains in use by Gravesend Cricket Club who have used the ground as their home since their formation in 1880. The site also has lawn bowls and tennis facilities and is the home of Gravesend Bowls Club.\n\nThe ground is situated south of Gravesend town centre on the western side of the A227 Wrotham Road. The Bat and Ball Inn, which was named after the ground, is on the eastern side of the ground.\n\nThe first recorded cricket match on the site of the ground was in 1840 when a Gravesend team played Penenden Heath. It is believed by local historians that a new wicket was laid down at the ground in 1845 by Tom Adams who had played for Kent sides before and after the formation the County Club in 1842. The cricket ground was laid out in the grounds of Ruckland House, described as a \"large mansion\", and used as the private cricket ground for the house. It was later owned by the Darnley family from Cobham Hall to the south of Gravesend, and by the Billings family.\n\nKent County Cricket Club first used the ground in 1849 for a match against an All-England Eleven in the grounds first first-class cricket match. From 1849 to 1971 the ground was the venue for 142 first-class matches for Kent, the last of which saw them play the touring Pakistan team in 1971. The ground was used regularly for County Championship matches by Kent between the start of the Championship in 1890 and 1970 with one or two matches scheduled by the county at the ground in almost every season. Kent played the touring Australian side on the ground in 1893 and two matches were played by the South of England cricket team against Australian tourists in 1884 and 1886.\n\nNon-first class matches held on the ground include one of the first matches played by the Australian Aboriginal team which toured England in 1868 – the first tour by any Australian side. The team had arrived at Gravesend and were taken to lunch at the Bat and Ball inn next to the ground. The first matches on the tours of England by the West Indies in 1933 and Indian team in 1936 were at the ground, both against teams organised by Kent great Tich Freeman, and the West Indian tourists of 1939 played against a team organised by Les Ames at the Bat and Ball Ground. In 1963 the West Indies returned again to play the Club Cricket Conference.\n\nThe ground has also played host to 24 matches involving the Kent Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship and Second XI Championship. In local cricket, the ground is the home venue of Gravesend Cricket Club who play in the Kent Cricket League.\n\nA total of 145 games classified by sources as first-class cricket matches were played on the ground. All except two matches featured Kent as the home side. The South of England cricket team played two first-class matches on the ground in the 1880s.\n\nThe ground has been used for a number of sports and was used during the winter by Gravesend Hockey Club for a number of years for field hockey matches. It has also been used for school sports, association football, rugby union and was flooded and used as an ice skating rink during the harsh winter of 1895.\n\n"}

{"id": "22268618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22268618", "title": "East End Park (Cincinnati)", "text": "East End Park (Cincinnati)\n\nEast End Park is a former major league baseball park located in the East End neighborhood of Cincinnati in the United States. The ballpark, which is also known to baseball historians as Pendleton Park, was home to the Cincinnati Reds of the American Association (now more commonly known as the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers) during the 1891 baseball season. The club was led by the flamboyant star, Mike \"King\" Kelly.\n\nThe east side Reds had no relationship to the current Cincinnati Reds team. Those Reds had transferred from the Association to the National League in 1890. With the League and the Association on bad terms following several years of peace and Players' League stress of 1890, the Association decided to field a team of its own in Cincinnati for 1891.\n\nThis peculiar situation gave the city of Cincinnati two major league baseball teams in the same year with the same nickname. The National League Reds, who played on the west side of Cincinnati; and the Association Reds who played on the east side. Adding to the confusion was the presence of another Reds team in the Association, the Boston Reds. All of these Reds teams derived their nicknames, indirectly, from the original Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869–1870.\n\nThe east side Reds team has also been referred to as Kelly's Killers and the Cincinnati Porkers, as well as Kelly's Wonders, Kelly's Braves and Kelly's Hustlers. Some historians have extended the best known of these informal names by calling them the \"Cincinnati Kelly's Killers\". However, the Cincinnati papers who covered the team in 1891 only occasionally referred to the club by any of these nicknames.\n\nKelly's search for a suitable playing field led him to what was then the far east end of the city, in a picturesque location along the Ohio River that was known as Pendleton Park or Pendleton Grounds. The club secured a lease and built a small ballpark within Pendleton Park, which was dubbed East End Park by the media.\n\nThe location of the park was just off Eastern Avenue (now called Riverside Drive), where the Schmidt Recreation Complex is currently located. The ballpark was located between modern day Humbert Street (southwest, right field); Babb (or Babby) Alley (northeast, some distance beyond third base); Watson Street (southeast, left field); and Ridgeley Street (northwest, first base). Ridgeley street now dead ends at Babby Alley but it once extended the distance of the third base bleachers. The diamond was situated toward the northwest (or actually north-northwest) corner of the block.\n\nJust south of Humbert is the Ohio River. Many patrons attending east end Reds games were dropped off by steamboat, coming either from the city or from Coney Island. East End Park was one of only a handful of major league parks to have access by way of a river.\n\nAt the time, the National League did not allow Sunday baseball games to be played. As a result, the rival American Association capitalized on this by having their teams play Sunday games. However, the Cincinnati Association club had difficulty with this because the city had the blue law in place which also disallowed Sunday games. Owners of the Cincinnati Reds made repeated attempts at playing games on Sundays. Sometimes the Mayor of Cincinnati, Mayor John B. Mosby, would enforce the law and other times he would not. When the Mayor did enforce the law, the Reds and their opponents found themselves in jail.\n\nIn one instance, before a game played on May 24 against the Philadelphia Athletics, the Chief of Police behaved like a Colonel in the US Army. Dressed in a full military uniform, Chief Dietsch had seventy-five of his police officers march back and forth on the baseball field prior to game time to try to intimidate the baseball club. He even went as far as to have seventy-five more police officers waiting at the station if the Reds attempted to play. The players went ahead and attempted to play anyway. When the game entered the second half of the first inning, Chief Deitsch had enough and had his officers arrest all of the players. The next day the Cincinnati Commercial Gazette reported that \"It would be commendable in Chief Deitsch if he would display as much zeal in closing saloons and shutting off a few of the crap games that he has shown in stopping Sunday base ball.\" \n\nThe east side Reds ballpark proved to be too remote for drawing fans consistently and as a result the club did not fare very well at the box office. During a day off on August 17, it was decided to suspend operations of the franchise until a new ballpark could be built on the west side of town. Ownership was planning to reactivate the club for the start of the 1892 baseball season. The final Reds game played at East End Park was on August 13 against the Boston Reds. The game resulted in a 1-7 Cincinnati loss. The club's final game was on the road with an 8-0 loss to the St. Louis Browns on August 16, 1891, in St. Louis.\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers of the Western League stepped in and finished out the Reds schedule. Several of Mike Kelly's Reds joined the Milwaukee club including business manager Frank Bancroft. The Brewers played their first game on the 18th, again in St. Louis. Kelly was not among the new club's members, as he returned to his familiar home in Boston to resume his career, playing with the AA's Boston Reds club and then finishing the season with the Boston Beaneaters of the NL.\n\nKelly's Beaneaters won the League pennant while the Boston Reds would go on to win the Association pennant. This proved to be the last hurrah for the Association, which merged with the National League during the off-season. With a Cincinnati team already in the National League, the Cincinnati Association franchise was done.\n\nIn 1896, a few years after the short-lived experiment with major league baseball on the east side of Cincinnati failed, the Pendleton grounds were acquired by the Cincinnati Gymnasium and Athletic Club, and became known as the Cincinnati Gym Grounds. The Athletic Club retained the ballfield and grandstand, and built a swimming pool in the center field area near the clubhouse building.\n\nThe East End ballpark suffered severe damage following flooding in the spring of 1897, situated as it was in the floodplain of the Ohio River. The outfield wall and bleachers were swept out into the Ohio River, leaving just the grandstand, pavilion and club house. All were restored during late spring of 1897 and were ready for use again.\n\nThe ballpark was considered for use as a temporary home for the National League Reds in 1900, after League Park was severely damaged by fire the night of May 27–28. The Reds instead chose to play their games on the road for the next month until their own park could be sufficiently restored.\n\nCincinnati's Board of Park Commissioners and Park Department proposed a concrete sidewalk to be created and that it extend the length of the park bordering with Eastern Avenue to provide a place for people to walk to and from work; however a 10-foot artificial stone sidewalk was established. Thoughts of improving the grounds were not welcomed as the annual flooding prevents permanent structures from being built. Benches that had been placed the year before were washed away by the recent floods.\n\nThe larger park area once known as Pendleton Park (which historians often present as the name for the ballpark itself) still exists and is currently known as Schmidt Recreation Complex or Schmidt Recreation Center, which has four softball diamonds, two of them overlapping the East End Park site, and two of them further west within the park.\n\nThe current softball field known as C.L. Harrison Field approximates the original orientation of the diamond, only somewhat farther to the north. The photographic evidence indicates that the original 1891 diamond was located in what would be the right field area of the Harrison field. In the opposite corner of the property, another softball field, the current Paul Kramer Field, occupies what was once the outfield area of East End Park.\n\nThe surroundings of the park are not significantly different from the 1890s. A number of the nearby houses still stand. Aerial views from Google maps indicate that water from the Ohio still wreaks occasional havoc with the ballfields there.\n\nOnly a small number of major league baseball fields from the 1890s survive as athletic fields (Cleveland's League Park, and St. Louis' Sportsman's Park, for example.). The two softball diamonds occupying East End Park's footprint allow the visitor a rare opportunity to imagine major league baseball being played there, over a century earlier.\n\n"}

{"id": "689621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=689621", "title": "Franklin Field", "text": "Franklin Field\n\nFranklin Field is the home of the Penn Relays, and is the University of Pennsylvania's stadium for football, track and field, lacrosse and formerly for soccer, field hockey and baseball. It is also used by Penn students for recreation, and for intramural and club sports, including touch football and cricket, and is the site of Penn's graduation exercises, weather permitting.\n\nFranklin Field is located in Philadelphia, at the eastern edge of Penn's campus, across the Schuylkill River from Center City.\n\nDeemed by the NCAA as the oldest stadium still operating for football, it was the site of the nation's first scoreboard in 1895, the nation's first stadium with an upper deck of seats in 1922, and was the site of the first radio broadcast of a football game in 1922 on WIP and the first television broadcast of a football game by Philco.\n\nFrom 1958 until 1970, the stadium was the home field of the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League.\n\n Franklin Field was built for and dedicated on April 20, 1895, for the first running of the Penn Relays. \nThe Field supplemented and eventually replaced the venue called University Grounds, which was located a few blocks west on a block bounded by Spruce Street (north), 38th Street (east), Pine Street (south), Woodland Avenue and 37th Street T-intersection (northwest). Its location was typically given as \"37th and Spruce\".\n\nPermanent Franklin Field construction did not begin until after the turn of the century. Weightman Hall gymnasium, the stadium, and permanent grandstands were designed by architect Frank Miles Day & Brother and were erected from 1903 to 1905 at a cost of . The field was 714 feet long and 443 feet wide. The site featured a ¼-mile track, a football field, and a baseball diamond. Beneath the stands were indoor tracks and indoor training facilities.\n\nIn 1916, university officials, led by George Neitzche, planned with the city to build a new 100,000-seat half-sunken stadium for $750,000 at Woodland Ravine, a depression on the southeastern side of Woodland Cemetery. Plans called for a new train station called Union Station which would feature a Pennsylvania Railroad stop and a stop on a proposed (and never built) elevated subway line connected to the Market–Frankford Line. Architecture firm Koronski & Cameron created a rendering but plans quickly collapsed. Five years later, it was decided instead to expand Franklin Field.\n\nThe current stadium structure was built in the 1920s, designed by Day & Klauder, after the original wooden bleachers were torn down. The lower tier was erected in 1922. The old wood stands were razed immediately following the Penn Relays and the new concrete lower tier and seating for 50,000 were built. The second tier was added in 1925, again designed by Day & Klauder, when it became the second (and the largest) two-tiered stadium in the United States.\n\nThe 1936 Democratic National Convention was concluded at Franklin Field, where President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his acceptance speech after being renominated for a second term.\n\nIn the university's football heyday—when Penn led the nation in attendance—the 65,000-seat stadium was expanded each fall with temporary stands to seat 78,000. Today, Franklin Field, named after Penn's founder, Benjamin Franklin, seats 52,958.\n\nFranklin Field switched from grass to AstroTurf in 1969. It was the first National Football League stadium to use artificial turf. The stadium's fifth AstroTurf surface was installed in 1993. The current Sprinturf field replaced the AstroTurf in 2004. Franklin Field was considered a candidate to host games for the 1994 World Cup. FIFA required that host stadiums have natural grass. Had Philadelphia been selected and Franklin Field used, the stadium would have had to return to a grass surface, or perhaps use a temporary grass field as was done at two World Cup sites—Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan.\n\nFranklin Field has hosted the annual Penn Relays Carnival, the largest track-and-field meet in the U.S., for over 100 years.\n\nThe first Penn Relays was held in 1895. Frank B. Ellis, chairman of Penn's track committee, was looking for an event to mark the dedication of the school's then new stadium, Franklin Field. Two years earlier, during his senior year at Penn, Penn and Princeton competed in a one-mile relay race in which four runners from each school each ran a quarter of a mile. That race had been an outgrowth of intramural relay races held at Penn. Ellis and others arranged a series of relay races to take place on Saturday afternoon, April 20, 1895. 64 competitors from eight colleges, six prep schools and two high schools took part. Eight two-team races were run with Harvard beating Penn in the mile-relay feature in 3:34.4.\n\nThe Relays were featured in the April 29, 1961, premiere of ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\".\n\nThe 2nd USSR-United States Track and Field dual meet was held at Franklin Field on July 18 and 19, 1959. Stars who competed included Parry O'Brien, Ray Norton, Al Cantello, Hayes Jones, Tamara Press, Vasili Kuznetsov, Dyrol Burleson, Greg Bell, a young Wilma Rudolph, and future long-jump great Igor Ter-Ovanesyan.\n\nFranklin Field hosted the NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in June 1961, the first time the championship was held on the East Coast. Seven records were set, and the University of Southern California won its 21st team Track & Field championship.\n\nFollowing the Montreal 1976 Summer Olympics and in honor of the United States Bicentennial, Franklin Field hosted The Bicentennial Meet of Champions track and field event on August 4, 1976. Montreal Olympians at the meet included Hasely Crawford, Don Quarrie, Michael Shine and Edwin Moses. The meet was also a chance for top runners including Houston McTear who had not been able to compete in Montreal to race against medal winners. 13,722 attended the event and saw Dwight Stones set a record for the high-jump and John Walker win the mile.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania hosted the two-day 1980 Liberty Bell Track and Field Classic, an alternate to the 1980 Summer Olympics for 26 countries participating in the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics which were held in Moscow. The Liberty Bell Classic began on July 16, 1980. It was the largest international track meet held in the U.S. since the 1932 Summer Olympics in terms of the number of foreign competitors. Franklin Field hosted the track and field events where 20,111 spectators saw the final evening of competitions. In several events, the times were better than those in Moscow, such as American Renaldo Nehemiah's time of 13.31 in the 110m hurdles ahead of East German gold medal winner Thomas Munkelt's time of 13.39.\n\nThe track in Franklin Field has a rarely used configuration where the 400 metre circumference is achieved in lane 5, rather than in lane one. Thus there are two curbs on the track, inside of lane one and also inside of lane 5. In order to accommodate the full fields of the Penn Relays and other meets, special adaptations are made with a movable curb on the backstretch to stagger the runners to arrive at a common break point in lane 5, rather than the conventional lane one. Single lap races in the inner lanes, run portions of an extra straightaway. Multiple lap races spend the majority of the race in lane 5 to run the proper distances.\n\nThe current track was installed in 2015 by ATT Sports, Inc., and uses a Rekortan track surface.\n\nPenn football played on Franklin Field for the first time in 1895. The University of Pennsylvania was one of the top football schools in the first years of college football. Many consider Penn to have been the national champion in college football in 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904. Other sources identify Penn as national champions in 1895, 1897, 1904 and 1908. John H. Outland played at Franklin Field for Penn in 1897 and 1898. On October 26, 1907, Jim Thorpe and the Carlisle Indian school trounced a powerful University of Pennsylvania team, 26-6, before an overflow crowd of 20,000 at Franklin Field. Red Grange set an NCAA record at Franklin Field when he rushed for 331 yards in the University of Illinois' 24–2 victory over Penn on October 31, 1925, before 67,877 spectators.\n\nOn Saturday, November 16, 2002, ESPN broadcast College GameDay from Franklin Field prior to the game between Penn and Harvard. Both teams entered the game undefeated, 5–0, in the conference. It was College GameDay's first broadcast from a Division I-AA college. Penn won the contest, 44–9, and was undefeated and untied for the season. Harvard finished 6–1 in conference, 7–3 overall.\n\nThe Penn Quakers football team played their 800th game ever at the stadium on October 4, 2008, against Dartmouth.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles played at Franklin Field from 1958 through 1970. They moved to the stadium for the 1958 season after leaving Connie Mack Stadium. Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000. According to then-Eagles president Frank L. McNamee, the Eagles did not pay rent for use of Franklin Field because Penn was a not-for-profit organization. Instead, the Eagles donated between $75,000 and $100,000 per-year to pay for maintenance and other expenses. The university collected all concessions and parking revenue.\n\nOn October 11, 1959, NFL Commissioner Bert Bell died after suffering a heart attack at Franklin Field during the last two minutes of the game between the Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThe Eagles hosted the 1960 NFL Championship Game here, defeating the Green Bay Packers, 17–13, in Packers' coach Vince Lombardi's only career playoff loss. Attendance for the championship was 67,325.\n\nTwo infamous incidents in Eagles history occurred at the stadium.\n\nDuring the December 15, 1968 game against the Minnesota Vikings, a Christmas show was planned for halftime. The Eagles had entered the game 2–11, and fans were none too pleased with Eagles quarterback Norm Snead, owner Jerry Wolman, and especially coach Joe Kuharich: many fans came to the game wearing \"Joe Must Go\" buttons. Unfortunately, the man meant to play Santa was unable to make it to Franklin Field due to the bad weather. In lieu of the original halftime show, a 19-year-old fan named Frank Olivo (who came to the stadium already wearing a Santa Claus costume) was invited onto the field to toss candy canes with the cheerleaders. Frustrated by the team, the ugly wet weather, and his unconvincing beard, fans booed Olivo and threw snowballs at him. This incident is often referred to by sportscasters in denigrating Philadelphia sports fans as so mean they booed Santa Claus. The Eagles lost the game, 24–17. (Olivo continued to attend Eagles games and even made a return as Santa Claus four decades later, at the Eagles' December 27, 2009 game against the Denver Broncos at Lincoln Financial Field.)\n\nOn November 23, 1970, announcer Howard Cosell was apparently drunk during a nationally televised broadcast of the Eagles-New York Giants \"Monday Night Football\" game. After throwing up on color commentator Don Meredith's cowboy boots shortly before halftime, Cosell left the stadium and took a taxi back to New York City. Meredith and play-by-play announcer Keith Jackson made little mention of his departure during the second half. Later, denying drunkenness, Cosell claimed that he had been dizzy from running laps around Franklin Field's track before the game with track star Tommie Smith.\n\nThe Army–Navy Game was played 18 times at Franklin Field between 1899 and 1935 before moving to the larger Municipal Stadium in South Philadelphia in 1936. Penn alumnus and Olympic-medalist George Orton (who had worked with Frank Ellis in managing the Penn Relays) is credited with helping to bring the game to Philadelphia in 1899.\n\nTemple University played its home football games at Temple Stadium until the late 1970s. Temple Stadium had opened in 1928 and sat up to 34,000 for football. Over the years, Temple had played home games at Franklin Field when crowds were expected to exceed Temple Stadium's capacity. Temple moved its home games to Veterans Stadium in the late 1970s but the Phillies had priority for the field for Saturdays during baseball season, which ends the last week in September. When Temple home games conflicted with Phillies home games, Temple would play at Franklin Field. This continued through the 2002 season, Temple's final year at the Vet before the Owls moved to Lincoln Financial Field as tenants of the Eagles. One of the last Temple football games at Franklin Field was a 44–21 loss to the number-one-ranked Miami Hurricanes on September 14, 2002; Miami's Willis McGahee rushed for 134 yards and four touchdowns in front of 33,169 fans.\n\nIn 2016, the multi-division Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) held the second installment of its six NCAA Division III post-season bowl games (over three days) at Franklin Field for select member teams that did not make the DIII playoffs.

Ten international style ballroom dances—five Standard and five Latin—are defined by the World Dance Council (WDC), which has world-wide membership of all countries taking part in ballroom competitions. \n\nThe WDC incorporates various groupings and former titles, such as the World Dance and DanceSport Council (former title). The WDC is the governing body for international professional and amateur DanceSport. The World DanceSport Federation is, to some extent, a rival body which issues rules for amateur competitions. The list is supplemented by nine American style dances—four Smooth and five Rhythm—which are defined by United States dance organizations, such as USA Dance, (formerly USABDA, the United States Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association).</onlyinclude>\n\nBesides determining which dances are performed, these organizations specify many other aspects of their competitions, for instance, the tempo of music allowed and the duration of each competition round.\n\nWithin World Dance Council international competitions are two categories of dances, \"Ballroom\" (also called Standard or Modern) and \"Latin\". In England (e.g. at the Blackpool Dance Festival), the categories are traditionally called Ballroom and Latin American dances respectively. In the Ballroom dances, men typically wear evening dress (coattails, waistcoats and white bow ties), while women wear gowns. Partners remain in closed position throughout the dance, and movements tend to be elegant and sweeping. The ballroom dances are progressive, moving anti-clockwise round the floor. \n\nThe Latin dances are more overtly sensual, with skimpy costumes for women and tight-fitting ones for men. More variation in movement is allowed than in the Standard dances. Close, semi-open and open figures are danced. Choreography is now extremely important. Hip action - Latin technique is required; and athletic and balletic maneuvers are incorporated which makes it into a DanceSport. Two Latin dances are progressive going counter clockwise (samba and paso doble), but there is no obligation to consistently move round the floor.\n\n<onlyinclude>\n</onlyinclude>\n\nThe Smooth and Rhythm categories of American style DanceSport roughly correspond to the Standard and Latin categories of International style. In Smooth, dancers wear costumes not greatly dissimilar to those worn by their counterparts in Standard---Standard dresses often have prominent floats embellishing the arms and fuller skirts which are typically absent in Smooth, due to the open movement and changing arm positions requiring less restriction on the body; however, the dances themselves are significantly different as a result of influence by dancers like Fred Astaire and Arthur Murray in the years following World War II. While elegance and flow remain the goal, as in International Standard, dancers do not remain in closed position exclusively, instead breaking away from each other periodically and experimenting with open footwork. The Rhythm dances were also influenced by American dancers of the post-World War II era, but the differences between it and International Latin are more subtle. Costumes are similar, and while step patterns are not identical, movements are as free and explicitly sensual as in Latin.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "568129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=568129", "title": "Neutral zone trap", "text": "Neutral zone trap\n\nThe neutral zone trap (often referred to as simply the trap) is a defensive strategy used in ice hockey to prevent an opposing team from proceeding through the neutral zone (the area between the blue lines) to force turnovers. The strategy is generally used to level the playing field for teams that are not as offensively talented as their opponents, although the trap can also be used by teams simply looking to protect a lead late in the game. The trap was innovated by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1920s and 1930s but became the defensive scheme for most coaches during the late 90s and early 2000s—known as the \"Dead Puck era\"—as a direct result of the success seen by the New Jersey Devils under the coaching of Jacques Lemaire, who perfected the trap defense to 3 Stanley cups in 1995, 2000, and 2003 for the New Jersey Devils. Lemaire utilized the trap that was employed by the Montreal Canadiens under his coach Scotty Bowman.\n\nThe most recognizable implementation of the trap sees the defense stationing four of their players in the neutral zone and one forechecker in the offensive zone. As the offensive team starts to move up the ice, the forechecker (generally the center) will cut off passing lanes to other offensive players by staying in the middle of the ice, forcing the puck carrier to either sideboard. The defensive wingers—typically placed on or near the red line—will be positioned by the boards to challenge the puck carrier, prevent passing, or even keep opponents from moving through. The two defencemen who are positioned on or near the blue lines are the last defence, and must stall the opposition long enough for the wingers to reset themselves and continue the trap.\n\nThe trap has been widely criticized for reducing scoring. It has, however, proven to be very effective, especially in the playoffs; most recently, the Washington Capitals employed the neutral zone trap to great effect during their 2018 Stanley Cup run. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, serious discussion about opening the game to offense was held between the NHL and NHL Players Association (NHLPA). Because it is easier to trap when engaging in obstruction and restraining fouls, such as hooking and holding, which slow the progress of faster players who can evade the trapping team, the NHL ordered officials to call every obstruction penalty, regardless of circumstance. The prohibition on two-line passes from behind a team's blue line to the other side of the red line was also lifted. Long passes are one method for breaking out of the trap, as it avoids the need to navigate through defenders in the neutral zone, although it has high rates of turnovers. The NHL also implemented a “Goalkeeper’s Restricted Area”, a trapezoidal area behind the net outside of which goalies cannot play the puck if they are behind the goal line. This allows offenses to more effectively dump the puck past the trap into the corners. Defensive minded teams have reverted to a \"third man high\" 1–3–1 system where only two offensive players will commit down low, allowing the third to join the defence and impede progress across the blue line.\n"}

{"id": "329401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=329401", "title": "Progressive Field", "text": "Progressive Field\n\nProgressive Field is a baseball park located in the downtown area of Cleveland, Ohio, United States. It is the home field of the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball and, together with Quicken Loans Arena, is part of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex. It was ranked as Major League Baseball's best ballpark in a 2008 \"Sports Illustrated\" fan opinion poll.\n\nThe ballpark opened as Jacobs Field in 1994 to replace Cleveland Stadium, which the team had shared with the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League. Since 2008, the facility has been named for Progressive Corporation, based in the Cleveland suburb of Mayfield, which purchased naming rights for $58 million over 16 years. The previous name came from team owners Richard and David Jacobs, who had acquired naming rights when the facility opened. The ballpark is still often referred to as \"The Jake\", based on its original name.\n\nWhen it opened, the listed seating capacity was 42,865 people and between 1995 and 2001 the team sold out 455 consecutive regular-season games. Modifications over the years resulted in several moderate changes to the capacity, peaking at 45,569 in 2010. After the 2014 and 2015 seasons, the facility was renovated in two phases, which upgraded and reconfigured several areas of the park and reduced seating capacity. As of 2018, seating capacity is listed at 35,041 people, though additional fans can be accommodated through standing room areas and temporary seating.\n\nSince moving to Progressive Field, the Indians have won 10 Central Division titles and have hosted playoff games in 10 seasons, the most recent being in 2017. Progressive Field is one of the few facilities in baseball history to host the Major League Baseball All-Star Game and games of the World Series in the same season, which occurred in 1997. The Indians have hosted games of the American League Championship Series in five seasons and have advanced to the World Series three times at the park.\n\nThe Cleveland Indians previously played home games at Cleveland Stadium, which they shared with the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League. The Indians first played at the stadium, which seated nearly 80,000 people for baseball, for the 1932 and 1933 seasons, but returned to smaller League Park for most games in 1934. From 1936 to 1946, they played weekend and holiday games at Cleveland Stadium, and eventually night games and other dates where larger crowds were expected, moving to the stadium full-time in 1947. Cleveland Stadium was the largest stadium in the American League during its tenure as a baseball facility and was the largest stadium in Major League Baseball for all but a few seasons. It had been a symbol of the Indians' glory years of the 1940s and 1950s, attracting some of the largest crowds in baseball history. However, during the team's lean years from the 1960s through the early 1990s, even crowds of 40,000 people were swallowed up in the environment. As a result, the Indians began pressing for a new stadium.\n\nPlans for a new stadium first began in 1984 when Cuyahoga County voters defeated a property tax for building a 100% publicly funded domed stadium, which would have been shared by the Indians and Browns. Later that year, committee leaders met to re-evaluate these plans, and a location was later agreed upon. The eventual site of the stadium, the location of the Central Market, was acquired in December 1985. In April 1986, designs for the new stadium were agreed upon and about a year later, demolition at the site started. Cuyahoga County voters approved a 15-year sin tax on alcohol and cigarette sales in May 1990 to finance the new Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex, which included the ballpark, an adjacent arena for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and two parking garages. Construction started in January 1992, and by May of that year, the concrete construction had been poured. In June 1992, Mel Harder, who pitched the opening game at Cleveland Stadium in 1932, and contemporary stars Charles Nagy and Sandy Alomar, Jr., executed the ceremonial first pitch at the site of the new ballpark before construction began. The installation of seating was completed in October 1993. The ballpark, which was referred to as \"Cleveland Indians Baseball Park\" and \"Indians Park\" on blueprints, cost approximately $175 million to build, of which $91 million was provided by Indians owner Richard Jacobs. The remaining $84 million was raised by the sin tax.\n\nAn open house was held April 1, 1994, and the following day, an exhibition game was held against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The first official game was held April 4. U.S. President Bill Clinton threw out the ceremonial first pitch, and the Indians defeated the Seattle Mariners 4–3 in 11 innings in front of a crowd of 41,459 people. The ballpark was the first new major sporting facility to open in Cleveland since Cleveland Arena opened in 1937. During that inaugural and strike-shortened 1994 season, the Indians finished 35–16 at home, which included an 18-game home winning streak.\n\nThe ballpark hosted playoff games for the first time in 1995 as the Indians ended a 41-year playoff drought. The first playoff game was on October 3, a 5–4 win in 11 innings over the Boston Red Sox in Game 1 of the American League Division Series. Jacobs Field also played host to Games 3, 4, and 5 of the American League Championship Series against the Seattle Mariners and Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1995 World Series against the Atlanta Braves. Two years later, Jacobs Field hosted its first All-Star Game and the first All Star Game in Cleveland since 1981. Later that year, the Indians hosted Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1997 World Series against the Florida Marlins. It was the tenth time in Major League history the All-Star Game and games of the World Series were played in the same facility in the same season, and the first time since 1977. The longest home run in ballpark history was hit by Jim Thome on July 3, 1999, measured at to center field.\n\nDuring the eighth inning of Game 2 of the 2007 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees on October 5, a swarm of insects believed to be midges from Lake Erie, enveloped the playing field, severely distracting Yankees relief pitcher Joba Chamberlain, which caused him to walk outfielder Grady Sizemore, who later scored the tying run on a wild pitch. The incident became known as the \"Bug Game\"; however, this was not the first time the insects plagued Jacobs Field.\n\nProgressive Field set a new MLB record between June 12, 1995 and April 4, 2001 in selling out 455 straight games. Demand for tickets was so great that all 81 home games were sold out before opening day in five separate seasons. The Indians retired the number 455 in honor of the sellout record. The Boston Red Sox later surpassed this record when Fenway Park recorded 456 straight sellouts on September 9, 2008. The record for the largest attendance at Progressive Field was set in Game 3 of the 1997 ALDS when 45,274 people attended the game. On Saturday, April 2, 2011, the Indians' lowest attendance record was broken with a very small crowd of 9,853, and again the following day with an even smaller attendance figure of 8,726.\n\nNaming rights were acquired in 1994 by team owner Richard Jacobs, who paid for rights until the end of 2006. The Jacobs Field name gave rise to the nickname \"The Jake\" for the ballpark.\n\nThe Indians announced on January 11, 2008, that naming rights to the park had been purchased by Progressive Corporation, a major insurance company headquartered in the nearby suburb of Mayfield, Ohio, for $58 million over 16 years.\n\nRemoval of the iconic Jacobs Field sign on the front of the building began the morning of January 18, and the replacement sign was installed on March 25. Progressive agreed to pay $57.6 million for the naming rights for 16 years. There were discussions about instead naming the ballpark \"Progressive Park\"; however, it was later realized that this name belonged to a picnic facility in Council Bluffs, Iowa, so the name \"Progressive Field\" was decided upon instead.\n\nThe Indians extended their lease agreement with Gateway Economic Development Corp. for the stadium in August 2008 from 2013 to 2023. The agreement gives the team four five-year renewal options after 2023.\n\nThe ballpark was designed by HOK Sport, now known as Populous, a division of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum. HOK designed it as the second retro-modern ballpark, with asymmetrical fences of varying heights, a smaller upper deck, and stepped tiers. It is similar to HOK's Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, which was the first retro-modern ballpark. The ballpark was sited to give a favorable view of Cleveland's downtown skyline. The structural engineering was done by a Cleveland company, Osborn Engineering, which helped design League Park, Cleveland Municipal Stadium, \"Old\" Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park. It was designed to blend in with the city of Cleveland with its exposed steel design and the vertical light towers that match the smoke stacks of Cleveland’s industrial zone.\n\nThe ballpark has numerous unique structural features. The field is situated on of Kentucky Bluegrass. It is illuminated by 19 white vertical light towers; three behind the scoreboard, six behind first base, six behind third base and four in right field, which stand above street level and above the playing field and are said to resemble oversized toothbrushes. The distinctive light towers were incorporated into a version of the original Jacobs Field logo and the 1997 MLB All-Star Game logo.\n\nThe park features distinctive dimensions; left and right field are both from homeplate, but left field has a high wall, known as the \"Little Green Monster\". The center and right field walls are high. The park features traditional hunter green seats angled at 8-12° on three tiers around the park except for center field which has no seats and left field which uses bleachers.\n\nThe bullpens, reconfigured between the 2014 and 2015 seasons, are raised above the playing field, which allows fans to see pitchers warming up. Both bullpens are located adjacent to section 103 behind right-center field, with the Indians' bullpen closer to the field. Like the majority of ballparks, the Indians' dugout is along the third base line and the visitors' dugout is located along the first base line. When the ballpark was built it contained 121 luxury boxes. A remodel and renovation between the 2014 and 2015 seasons removed six of them for a new total of 115, the second most in Major League Baseball.\nPrior to the start of the 1997 season, two sections with 480 seats were added onto the ends of the bleacher section. In 2004, South Dakota-based company Daktronics installed the then-largest video display at a sports venue in the world, measuring high by wide. The out-of-town scoreboard along the left field wall was also replaced. A new scoreboard system was installed for the 2016 season. The main scoreboard above the bleachers measures high by wide with of screen space, and is the largest scoreboard in Major League Baseball.\n\nIn 2007, the Indians became the first American League team to install solar panels on their stadium. They also spent $1.1 million to convert a picnic area behind the center field fence into \"Heritage Park\", which features 27 plaques honoring the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame and 38 bricks, representing the team's most memorable moments. There is also a memorial plaque commemorating Ray Chapman which was originally installed at League Park. This area is shielded by plantings so it does not interfere with the batter's eye. The Indians installed a corkscrew-shaped wind turbine from Cleveland State University above the southeast corner of the ballpark in late March 2012, the first major league team to do so. The corkscrew–shaped wind turbine was successful in generating more electricity than individual turbines and was originally scheduled to be tested for two years, but had to be removed in late March 2013 because of cracks that had developed in the off-season.\n\nThe team announced the first phase of renovation plans for Progressive Field in late 2014, which were completed prior to the start of the 2015 season. The area on either side of the right field gate, previously known as \"Gate C\", was reconfigured, with a pedestrian bridge and concession buildings removed to open the views of the surrounding neighborhood. The statue of Jim Thome was moved to the area, while the statue of Bob Feller was moved to a new location in the area, and a new statue of Larry Doby was added. A two-story bar named \"The Corner\" was built, providing better views of the field as the Batter's Eye Bar was often overcrowded on summer days. The bullpens, which had previously been separate, were relocated to the right center field area, allowing fans closer views of players warming up. To allow more light in the right field concourse, the mezzanine deck was reduced by several rows to open the area. The Kid's Clubhouse was made two stories, and adults are now able to view the game from the clubhouse. Seating in the upper deck behind right field and down the first base line was removed and replaced with terraces, available for use by large groups. Additional changes included installation of new concession areas and options, many of which are from Cleveland-area eateries.\n\nPrior to the opening of the 2016 season, the next phase of renovations was completed, which included the addition of a new club area behind home plate for season ticket holders, the installation of a new scoreboard system and additional scoreboards, new standing room areas in the left field area, and additional concession areas, again using local-based eateries.\n\nThe ballpark became the 11th MLB facility to have LED field lights installed, which was done prior to the start of the 2017 season. Wi-Fi was also installed throughout the ballpark prior to the start of the 2017 season.\n\nThe ballpark features several eateries from which spectators can watch the game. A glass-enclosed multilevel restaurant named the \"Terrace Club\" is located along the left field foul line on the suite level. Spectators need a valid game ticket and a pass to enter into the Terrace Club. On non-game days it is used for private and corporate events, such as business meetings, parties and weddings. The \"Budweiser Patio\" is a buffet eatery used mostly for corporate or private parties, located just behind the right field foul pole between the visitors' bullpen and section 117. A new children's play area named \"Kids Clubhouse\", located on the mezzanine level, opened in May 2012. It includes arts and crafts areas, a climbing wall, a mini field where children can practice sliding and fielding, a batting cage, as well as large windows where adults can watch the game from the Kids Clubhouse.\n\nOn January 15, 2012, the park hosted its first ice hockey game, a match between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Michigan Wolverines, the first outdoor college hockey game in Ohio.\n\nProgressive Field is occasionally used as a concert venue. It was first used for a concert on August 12, 1995 during its second season of use, when Jimmy Buffett played at the ballpark as part of his Domino College Tour. The panels set on the outfield grass to hold the stage, however, caused visible damage to the playing surface, leading Indians owner Richard Jacobs to ban concerts at the facility. Concerts returned to the ballpark in 2011 when the Indians hosted the Indians Music Festival, which featured Brad Paisley and Blake Shelton. Three years later, in 2014, Jason Aldean played at Progressive Field as part of his Burn It Down Tour, a performance that drew 40,516 fans and included Florida Georgia Line, Miranda Lambert, and Tyler Farr. In 2017, the ballpark hosted two concerts on consecutive nights, with Billy Joel performing on July 14 as part of Billy Joel in Concert, followed the next night by Luke Bryan and his Huntin', Fishin' and Lovin' Every Day Tour.\n\nAn event called \"Snow Days\" debuted at Progressive Field in November 2010. The first day, called \"Snopening Day\", was held on November 26 and the event continued until January 2, 2011. An ice skating track called the \"Frozen Mile\" was installed around the warning track, the \"Batterhorn\" was a snow tubing hill on the bleachers and other events were staged around the field and home run porch. \"Snow Days\" returned in November 2011, and closed on January 16. The Batterhorn was moved to the Toyota Home Run porch and the Frozen Mile was rerouted. The park also added the \"Frozen Diamond\", an ice rink covering the infield. On June 1, 2012, it was announced that \"Snow Days\" would not run in 2012 due to low attendance in 2011. In part, this was caused by the warmest winter on record, with temperatures of on \"Snopening Day.\"\n\n\n\"All firsts are by the Cleveland Indians unless otherwise stated\"\n"}

The system was commissioned at the end of November 2009.\n\nThe emergence of Chievo on the Serie A stage in recent years has split the city into two groups of archrival fans, both very loyal to their respective cause, these days with Chievo constantly battling to survive relegation in Serie A, and Hellas Verona just returning in the top tier after a four-year spell in the third division, after having won a \"scudetto\" in 1985.\n\nDespite playing two divisions lower than Chievo and missing out on travelling supporters from the large Serie A teams, Hellas Verona the city's traditionally bigger team still managed to maintain higher average attendances than their rival during the 2009–10 season.
