The only version of the event to remain at a high level of contemporary competition is the women's indoor pentathlon, which is present on the programme for the IAAF World Indoor Championships.\n\nThe athletics pentathlon featured on the Olympic Games schedule in two separate periods. During the early history of the event, an Olympic men's pentathlon was held and was present at the 1912, 1920 and 1924 games. The men's event was dropped, with the decathlon becoming the international standard. As women's events increasingly were contested internationally, the women's outdoor pentathlon was added and held for five straight editions from 1964 to 1980. The women's heptathlon superseded that event at international level in the early 1980s.\n\nThe International Women's Sports Federation was established in 1921 and the first reported women's pentathlon was in the 1922 Women's Olympiad in Monte Carlo. The events were 60 m, 300 m, high jump, two-hand javelin, and two-hand shot. In the late 1920s, the events were: shot and long jump on the first day, and 100 m, high jump, and javelin on the second day. The first world record recognised by the IAAF was set at the 1934 Women's World Games by Gisela Mauermayer. Prior to Olympic incorporation, the women's pentathlon featured at the AAA Championships, USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships and the Soviet Athletics Championships from the 1950s onwards.\n\nThe outdoor pentathlon is in common usage at lower age categories of the sport, allowing for easier training and event scheduling, and avoiding over-training of young athletes. For example, the lower division of the English Schools Combined Events Championships has pentathlons for both boys and girls. In high school athletics in North America, boys' and girls' pentathlons are held, consisting of the sprint hurdles, long jump, shot put, high jump, and an 800 m run (1500 m run for men). The pentathlon is used because it is less stressful on the athletes than a full multi and because many high school meets only last one day, it allows the event to be contested in the time limit.\n\nLess common, but standardised internationally is the throws pentathlon. This contains field throwing events only: hammer throw, shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, and weight throw. Although it does not have a position in high-profile global athletics competitions, it is present on the programme for the World Masters Athletics Championships for both men and women. This event features at national level in many developed English-speaking nations.\n"}

These three players are known as followers because they have traditionally been used as players that follow the ball all around the ground, as opposed to playing in a set position. In recent years, there has been a decreased emphasis on set positions in Australian football. Followers still cover more ground than any other player on the field.\n\nThe ruckman's job is to contest with the opposing ruckman at centre-bounces that take place at the start of each quarter or after each goal, and at stoppages (i.e., boundary throw ins, ball ups). The ruckman usually uses his height (typically players are over 195 cm tall) to palm/tap the ball down so that a ruck rover or rover can run onto it.\n\nNotable ruckmen in Australian football over the years include:\n\nBefore the 1950s, the role of the ruck-rover was known as the \"follower\". His role was to assist the ruckman and rover at centre bounces by blocking and shepherding them from opposition players. This position disappeared in the 1950s with the success of Ron Barassi, Jr. in a role designated for him by Melbourne coach Norm Smith. The closest equivalent of the follower position in today's game is known as a tagger.\n\nThe ruck rover's job is to be directly beneath the flight of the ball when a ruckman taps the ball down, allowing an easy take away, or clearance, from a stoppage. Typically players are not as tall as the ruckman, typically ranging from 170–190 cm in height.\n\nNotable followers and ruck-rovers in Australian football over the years include:\n\nThe rover is a player who lurks around centre bounces and stoppages to receive the ball from a ruck rover and complete a clearance.

The first venue to use that name, it seated 10,000 spectators. It was replaced with a new building on the same site.\n\nThe site upon which Madison Square Garden was eventually established was originally occupied by a small passenger depot of the New York and Harlem Railroad. The site was vacated by the railroad in 1871 when it moved operations uptown to 42nd Street. The site was vacant until 1874 when it was leased to P. T. Barnum who converted it into an open oval arena long, with seats and benches in banks, which he named the \"Great Roman Hippodrome\" where he presented circuses and other performances. The roofless building was also called \"Barnum's Monster Classical and Geological Hippodrome\" and measured by .\n\nIn 1876 the open-air arena was leased to band leader Patrick Gilmore, who renamed it \"Gilmore's Garden\" and presented flower shows, beauty contests, music concerts, temperance and revival meetings, walking marathons, and the first Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, called at the time (1877) the \"First Annual N.Y. Bench Show.\" Gilmore also presented boxing, but since competitive boxing matches were technically illegal at the time, he called them \"exhibitions\" or \"illustrated lectures.\"\n\nThe next to lease the space was W. M. Tileston, who was an official of the dog show. He attempted to attract a more genteel crowd with tennis, a riding school and an ice carnival; the arena had one of the first indoor ice rinks in the United States.\n\nAfter the death of Commodore Vanderbilt, who owned the site, his grandson William Kissam Vanderbilt took back control and announced on May 31, 1879 that the arena was to be renamed \"Madison Square Garden.\" Vanderbilt presented sporting events such as indoor track and field meets, a convention of Elks, the National Horse Show and more boxing, including some bouts featuring John L. Sullivan, who began a four-year series of exhibitions in July 1882, drawing over-capacity crowds. P.T. Barnum also used the Garden to exhibit Jumbo, the elephant he had bought from the London Zoo; he drew sufficient business to recover the $10,000 pricetag.\n\nAnother notable use of the first Garden was as a velodrome, an oval bicycle racing track with banked curves. At the time, bicycle racing was one of the biggest sports in the country. \"[T]he top riders [were] among the sports stars of their day. The bike races at Madison Square Garden were all the rage around the turn of the 20th century.\" Madison Square Garden was the most important bicycle racing track in the United States and the Olympic discipline known as the Madison is named after the original Garden.\n\nHowever, the roofless Garden was hot in the summertime and freezing in the wintertime. Vanderbilt eventually sold what \"Harper's Weekly\" called his \"patched-up, grimy, drafty, combustible old shell\" to a syndicate that included J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, James Stillman and W. W. Astor, who closed it to build a new arena designed by noted architect Stanford White. Demolition began in July 1889, and the second Madison Square Garden, which cost more than a half-million dollars to build, opened on June 6, 1890. It was demolished in 1926, and the New York Life Building, designed by Cass Gilbert and completed in 1928, replaced it on the site.\n\n\n"}

Good mental health also means that one has the ability to be mentally resilient, have a good life balance, having an absence of mental disorders and the ability to enjoy life. Elite athletes such as those competing in the Australian Football League(AFL), are at higher risk of developing a mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks and eating disorders. 16–34 years olds are also in the high risk category, which is the average age of a football player and extends to those who are being drafted, this puts AFL players in both high risk categories. A study conducted by Helen Christensen and Alison Parsons showed that 1 in 5 elite athletes suffered depressive symptoms. Playing elite sports is a great challenge emotionally, mentally as well as physically, some players can cope with all of these pressures while others cannot handle it and therefore suffer from a lack of mental health.\n\nAFL players are often forced to conform to the norms but also have high expectations placed on them such as extraordinary behavior, appearance and performance. They are perceived to be tough, and mentally tough, if they conform to these norms and display qualities such as having self-belief, mental and emotional resilience and a tough attitude. They are also expected to be extremely masculine and not show signs of emotional stress and upset, if they show these signs they are then perceived as weak and tend to be dropped from the team or squad. Usually only 35% of elite athletes will seek help from a professional as they tend to believe they are alright and can get better by themselves. They tend to be worried about others finding out about these issues as there seems to be a social stigma that they are weak if they suffer from any of these problems. The masculine stereotypes associated with AFL players is a potential barrier for players to come out and talk about their mental health problems.\n\nWhen a player exaggerates their negative performances or situations it often leads to mental health problems. Media has a big role in all of this. Players are constantly scrutinized about performance, the way they act, the way they look, etc., and the players then see this and tend to dwell on all of the negatives. This messes with the players psychologically and places an added pressure on them to perform and act better. \nThere have been a few cases made public of AFL players suffering from mental health problems. In 2015 it was noted that Mitch Clarke from Geelong Football Club has been suffering from mental health problems. When questioned it was not spoken about very much and all quite hidden. He was withdrawn from the team even after a huge win which sparked conversation in the community but Mitch Clarke never spoke much about it.\n\nAlso in 2015 Adam Goodes took a week off training and playing because of the 'emotional toll' he was put under during the season, receiving boos and racist comments from the crowd. He was also under analyses by the media which was all too much for him so it led to him taking time off and away from the sport.\n\nBarry Hall was also seen to be suffering mental health problems, admitting he had been suffering depression throughout his AFL career and that he \"had nothing to get out of bed for\" (Hall, 2011). Simon Hogan was another player who came out about their depression and had contemplated killing himself during his career. Lance Picioane who played for Adelaide, Hawthorn and the Kangaroos said how he struggled to understand that he was actually suffering from depression and that it wasn't him just feeling a little bit down.\n\nWayne Schwass, Nathan Thompson and Heath Black are other players who have come out and spoken about their struggle with anxiety and depression throughout their football careers.\n\nThere are many factors that lead to bad mental health in AFL players.\n\nPressure to win and to perform well week in and week out contributes to the bad mental state of some AFL players. Having such a heavy burden on their shoulders impacts their state of mind, and when they do under perform this can negatively affect a players mental health. There are also pressures from society to act professionally and look the part, be fit, strong and well groomed. They have high expectations on them as players and are encouraged to be the ideal male who is masculine, athletic, strong etc.. and this pressure is coming from within the club as well. If a player has a bad game it is written all over the media and it is hard for it not to affect the player emotionally.\n\nInjury and the risk of injury also contributes to this lack of mental health because if a player does become injured they will have a lower or no income and their position in next season is on the rocks so knowing this makes them stress. Being injured also means they cannot exercise as much and this sudden drop in physical activity levels makes the player more likely to become anxious or depressed as physical activity is a mood enhancer. On average a total of 40 players miss a total of 142 games a season. This is a huge number and a constant lingering concern for players. The whole process of finding out about their injury to rehabilitation and returning to the sport is an emotional roller-coaster for players as they have strong negative feelings when they find out about their diagnosis, to struggling through rehab then having the pressure to perform.\n\nHead injuries may affect the mind more directly.\n\nThe pressure of location and relocation is another toll on players. When drafting comes around young players are unsure what team will draft them.Having to relocate their entire lives to go train and play with a team is such a stress on the young players and can cause anxiety. Starting in a new team with new people, a new training structure and lifestyle can be a big shock to some players and they may experience social anxiety and exclusion which could lead to negative thoughts.\n\nDuring the week each player is critiqued by coaching staff to see where they can improve in their game, but constantly being under the pump can be mentally exhausting for players.\n\nThe environment in which they live and train in impacts a players mental health as it can affect the mental resilience which they build and creates their personality which could affect if they fit in or not. It also affects their natural resiliency to tough situations and how they handle things that come their way. If they do not have support from either family or friends everything can fall apart.\n\nPrevention, intervention and treatment for mental health has been neglected for quite some time and has never been a high priority to create groups to support this. 844 000 people commit suicide every year in the world so it is vital something is done to help the AFL players. It is shown that organised programs are one of the most effective ways to help treat mental illnesses such as depression and having a full-time staff member to facilitate this would be a greater benefit.\n\nAFL has put a framework in place to ensure the best mental health of the players and it encourages early identification and intervention. They hope to remove any stigmas from society and the people involved in AFL about mental health disorders. They aim to educate their players on mental health issues with online, face to face and peer to peer programs. They are hoping to create a space where the industry is able to recognize symptoms and to aid in early intervention.\n\nThis is a program set up by the AFL Players Association, teaching players about the signs and symptoms of mental illness so they can better understand the difference between feeling a bit sad one day and depression. Through a three session course players are exposed to realizing their own values, different mental health stories and how these both relate back to their lives and then being able to change anything they aren't happy with. They are also taught about different emotions and ways to surface them and talk about them to other people.\n\nThe AFL Players Association also have two other programs similar to the Manage Your Mind Well-being Program. Practical Mindfulness is another which is a hands on course that helps the players to be able to manage stress and build resilience to all the negative influences. Team wise is the third program they offer which is targeted at coaching staff, captains and influential players to develop skills in aiding other players to speak up and to be positive role models.\n\n\n"}

Its official name is the Sussex Senior Challenge Cup. For sponsorship purposes, from 2012 to 2018 it is also known as the Parafix Sussex Senior Cup after a new three-year sponsorship deal was agreed in 2015.\n\nFirst played in the 1882-83 season, shortly after the founding of the Sussex County Football Association in 1882, the first winners of the cup were Brighton Rangers. Other teams who won the cup in its early history are Burgess Hill, Lancing College and Eastbourne.\n\nThe team with most title wins in the competition's history are Worthing but teams who have been successful in the cup recently are Sussex's two Football League teams, Brighton & Hove Albion and Crawley Town. Bognor Regis Town won the competition a record five times in succession between 1980 and 1984.\n\nWinners also qualify for a place in the Sussex FA Community Shield match, traditionally the opening match each season in Sussex football. Brighton & Hove Albion are the current holders of the Sussex Senior Cup, having beaten Crawley Town 2–1 in the 2018 final in a repeat of the 2017 final.\n\nShortly after the Sussex County Football Association was founded in 1882 the inaugural competition of the Sussex Senior Club took place for the 1882-83 season. Brighton Rangers won the final of the first competition 3-0. Founder members of Sussex County FA include the public schools of Lancing College, Brighton College and Ardingly College and their old-boy teams dominated the cup early on, along with clubs such as Burgess Hill and Eastbourne, whose teams were made up of upper and middle class players.\n\nThe cup was initially contested only by amateur clubs. At the time Sussex's only professional club, Brighton and Hove Albion tried to enter the competition in 1905 but had to withdraw because of clashing dates. Albion won the Sussex Wartime Cup in 1943 but only entered the normal competition in 1946. Albion entered the competition again in 1975-76 following the abolition of the distinction between amateur and professional clubs in the English game.\n\nFollowing the 1913–14 competition, the cup was suspended due to the First World War, and resumed in 1919–20. During the Second World War the winners of the Sussex Wartime Cup were awarded the Sussex Senior Cup. The Sussex Wartime Cup took place on a league basis and a competition was held in every year during the Second World War except for 1940-41 when no competition for the Sussex Senior Cup was held.\n\nUnder Jack Pearce, Bognor Regis Town dominated the Sussex Senior Cup in the 1980s, winning the cup six times, including a record five times in succession, and finishing runners-up once.\n\nFrom 1950–51 the cup final took place at the Goldstone Ground every year until 1995 when Brighton sold their ground to developers. A crowd of over 7,000, the cup's highest attendance in recent years, saw the 2010–11 season final take place at Brighton's new American Express Community Stadium on 16 July 2011. It was the first competitive match to be played there. Brighton won the game 2–0 with Gary Hart scoring the first ever goal at the new ground. The cup final has taken place there every year since 2011.\n\nThe Sussex Senior Cup is open to all men's senior clubs in the historic county of Sussex that are affiliated to the Sussex County Football Association. In 2016–17 this was 50 clubs that play in the top ten tiers of the English football league system (Premier League, English Football League, National League, National League South, Isthmian League, Southern Combination Football League Premier Division, Southern Combination Football League Division One and Southern Counties East Premier Division).\n\nBeginning in September, the competition proceeds as a knockout tournament throughout its duration, consisting of three rounds, then quarter-finals, semi-finals and final, usually in May. A system of byes ensures that the highest placed 14 clubs in Sussex enter the competition in the second round. For reasons of fairness to other clubs, the Brighton & Hove Albion reserve team competes in the Sussex Senior Cup as, depending on season, the main squad are up to Football Championship level, many stages of the football league pyramid ahead of other teams.\n\nThe tournament is organised so that 32 clubs remain by the second round. 35 of the 37 clubs in the Southern Combination League Premier Division and Division One (tiers 9 and 10 of the English football league system) and one club from the Southern Counties East Premier Division (tier 9) enter in the first round. In the second round, the two highest ranked Southern Combination League Premier Division clubs from 2015–16 (Eastbourne Town and Peacehaven & Telscombe) enter the cup, as well as Bognor Regis Town, Brighton & Hove Albion, Burgess Hill Town, Crawley Town, East Grinstead Town, Eastbourne Borough, Hastings United, Horsham, Lewes, Three Bridges, Whitehawk and Worthing who all receive a bye to the second round.\n\n\nThe winners of the Sussex Senior Cup traditionally play the winners of the Sussex County Football League (since 2015-2016 the Southern Combination Football League) for the Sussex Community Shield (also known as the Sussex County FA Community Shield. The 2016 competition saw Horsham, the winners of the 2015-16 SCFL play Eastbourne Borough, the winners of the 2015-16 Sussex Senior Cup. Eastbourne Borough won the 2016 Sussex Community Shield 3-0.\n\nFor rounds before the semi-final stage, the venue of each match is determined when the fixtures are drawn; the first club drawn in a fixture is usually the home team and matches are played at the club's home ground. The semi-finals are played at a neutral venue, usually at the Sussex FA at Culver Road in Lancing.\n\nThe final of the Sussex Senior Cup was held at Preston Park in Brighton for the first four competitions, from 1883 to 1886. It was then held at the County Cricket Ground in Hove for 18 editions of the cup, with the exception of the 1891 season, which was held on a league basis. In 1906 the first cup final took place to have been played at the Goldstone Ground in Hove. At the time the Goldstone Ground was the home stadium of Brighton and Hove Albion, which for some time was Sussex's only professional football club. The Goldstone Ground was known to have hosted the final of the Sussex Senior Cup a record 55 times between 1906 and 1995. Other stadiums to have hosted the Susssex Senior Cup include The Dripping Pan in Lewes (held 14 times between 1920 and 1947), The Trafalgar Ground in Newhaven (held twice in 1931 and 1932), Woodside Road in Worthing (held 7 times between 1934 and 1997), The Saffrons in Eastbourne (held once in 1936), Queen Street in Horsham (held once in 1949), Broadfield Stadium in Crawley (held twice in 1998 and 1999) and Priory Lane in Eastbourne (held 11 times between 2000 and 2010). Since 2011 the final of the Sussex Senior Cup has been played at the Falmer Stadium in Brighton.\n\n\n34 different clubs have won the cup, and the majority of cups have been won by clubs from Brighton and Hove, Eastbourne and Worthing.\n\n\n"}

It is located inside McGaw Memorial Hall, to the north of Ryan Field.\n\nThe building opened in 1952 as a replacement for Patten Gymnasium, and was the site of the Final Four for the 1956 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. It was extensively renovated in 1983, at which time the main arena was renamed Welsh–Ryan Arena. At the conclusion of the 2016–17 basketball season, plans are to renovate and upgrade the arena as part of a $110 million project scheduled to be completed by late 2018. The renovation will displace the athletic programs that use the arena for the 2017–18 season.\n\nFor years, Welsh–Ryan Arena was the smallest arena in the Big Ten Conference and the only conference facility that did not seat at least 10,000.

Designed by the architectural firm of Holabird & Root & Burgee and built of reinforced concrete, McGaw Memorial Hall contained 54,000 square feet of interior space. The lighting system, consisting of 180 mercury vapor lights, was said to simulate \"pure daylight.\"\n\nPartitions, portable bleachers, and a removable basketball floor made the building suitable for a wide variety of uses. While the intent was to provide a space large enough to hold the entire student body of Northwestern University at once during convocations and other such campus occasions, the auditorium was also used by the North Shore Music Festival and, soon after its opening, by the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches. This event, held August 15–30, 1954, featured a convocation address by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nIn 1983 Northwestern completed extensive renovations on the interior of the McGaw Hall. The main arena was renamed Welsh–Ryan Arena in honor of the project's principal donor, insurance magnate Patrick G. Ryan, president of the Board of Trustees, and of his wife's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Robert J. Welsh, Sr. The lobby was renamed Ronald J. Chinnock Lobby after real estate tycoon Ronald Chinnock.\n\nThe McGaw Fieldhouse is a practice facility within the building, which in 1997 was renovated to allow practice space for basketball and volleyball.\n\nIn 2007, the Brown Family Basketball Center was constructed within the McGaw Fieldhouse to include new locker rooms and team lounges for the men's and women's basketball teams, as well as offices for their respective coaching staffs.\n\nIn 2016, Northwestern announced plans for a $110 million arena renovation, shuttering the facility for the 2017–18 season (the Wildcat men will play at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, with the women playing out of Evanston Township High School's Beardsley Gym that season). Capacity is expected to be reduced to around 7,500 by replacing the bleachers with chairback seats. The renovated facility will also have wider concourses, balconies behind the baskets, and suites. Before then, one of the few significant changes since the 1983 renovation had been the replacement of the arena's 1980s-vintage scoreboards with a modern video board.\n\n\n \n"}

They typically work by flanking the centre forward. Originally the name was given to forward players who went up and down the sides of the rink. Nowadays, there are different types of wingers in the game — out-and-out goal scorers, checkers who disrupt the opponents, and forwards who work along the boards and in the corners. They tend to be bigger than centreman and smaller than defenseman.\n\nThis position is commonly referred to by the side of the rink that the winger normally takes, i.e. \"left wing\" or \"right wing.\"\n\nThe wingers' responsibilities in the defensive zone include the following:\n\nWingers should typically not:\n\nWingers should be playing high in the zone, and always be vigilant for a breakout pass or a chance to chip the puck past the blue line. When wingers receive a pass along the boards, they can exercise a number of options:\n\n\nWingers are usually the last players to backcheck out of the offensive zone. On the backcheck, it is essential that they cover the last free opposing player rushing in. Once the puck is controlled by the opposing team in the defensive zone, however, wingers are responsible for covering the defenceman on their side of the ice.\n\nPrior to the puck being dropped for a face-off, players other than those taking the face-off must not make any physical contact with players on the opposite team, nor enter the face-off circle (where marked). After the puck is dropped, it is essential for wingers to engage the opposing players to prevent them from obtaining possession of the puck.\n\nOnce a team has established control of the puck, wingers can set themselves up into an appropriate position.\n\nSome wingers are also employed to handle faceoffs.\n"}

Course distances are set on the day of the event to achieve a winning time of around 80–90 minutes, after taking account of the snow conditions.\n\nSince 2013 the International Triathlon Union created a new version of the sport, which consist of 5 km of snowshoeing, 12km of ice skating and 8km of cross-country skiing. It is called winter triathlon S3, because the three sports start with an S (snowshoes, skate, ski). The first ITU event was held in Quebec, Canada in February 2015. However, the Canadian national winter triathlon championships have been running for over 30 years. The Winterlude Triathlon is the oldest established winter triathlon in Canada. \n\nThe sport was denied inclusion in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n"}
{"id": "12199725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12199725", "title": "World Series of Poker bracelet", "text": "World Series of Poker bracelet\n\nThe World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a poker player can win. Since 1976, a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual WSOP. Even if the victory occurred before 1976, WSOP championships are now counted as \"bracelets\". During the first years of the WSOP only a handful of bracelets were awarded each year. In 1990, there were only 14 bracelet events. By 2000, that number increased to 24. As the popularity of poker has increased during the 2000s, the number of events has likewise increased. In 2011, 58 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP, seven at the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE), and one to the WSOP National Circuit Champion. This brought the total number of bracelets awarded up to 959. Five additional bracelets were awarded for the first time in April 2013 at the inaugural World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific (WSOP APAC) in Melbourne, Australia.. In 2017, 74 for bracelets were awarded at the WSOP and an additional 11 will be awarded at the WSOPE in Czech Republic.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 2014 WSOP APAC, there have been 1083 bracelets awarded, 500 of which were won by 170 players who have won at least two bracelets, with all of the other bracelets being won by one-time winners. This includes (up to this point) 17 Main Event winners: Hal Fowler, Bill Smith, Mansour Matloubi, Brad Daugherty, Jim Bechtel, Russ Hamilton, Noel Furlong, Robert Varkonyi, Chris Moneymaker, Greg Raymer, Joe Hachem, Jamie Gold, Jerry Yang, Peter Eastgate, Pius Heinz, Ryan Riess and Martin Jacobson.\n\nSince Chris Moneymaker won the 2003 Main Event, (through the completion of Event  74 in 2017) only three players have won and followed it up with a win in another bracelet event, Jonathan Duhamel, Joe Cada and Joe McKeehen .\n\nThe 1976 bracelet looked \"like gold nuggets kind of hammered flat\". The bracelet in 1976 cost approximately $500. In the 1980s, Las Vegas jeweler Mordechai Yerushalmi became the exclusive manufacturer of WSOP bracelets until Harrah's Entertainment bought the rights to the WSOP in 2004. According to 2003 WSOP Champion Chris Moneymaker, the design of the bracelet remained relatively unchanged under Yerushalmi. In 2005, Gold and Diamond International based in Memphis, TN won the bid from Harrah's Entertainment to manufacture the 2005 World Series of Poker bracelets. The company also manufactures the WSOP circuit rings.\n\nIn 2006, Frederick Goldman, Inc. made the WSOP bracelets while luxury watch maker Corum introduced some commemorative watches as part of the prize package. In 2006, the Champion's bracelet had 259 stones including 7.2 carats (1.4 g) of diamonds, 120 grams of white and yellow gold. It also used rubies to represent the heart and diamond suits, a sapphire to represent the spade and three black diamonds to represent the clubs.\n\nIn 2007, Corum became the official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. Some of the 2007 World Series of Poker champions received both a watch and a bracelet from Corum. Corum designed four variations for the 2007 World Series of Poker Bracelets. The standard version that is presented to 53 winners features 53 diamonds. The Ladies World Champion receives a bracelet that is adorned with four black diamonds, two rubies and 87 blue sapphires. The $50,000 HORSE Champion Bracelet has 91 black diamonds and two rubies. The World Series of Poker Main Event Bracelet has 120 diamonds on 136 grams of 18 carat (75 percent) white gold. The value of the 2007 bracelets have not been released, but the typical price of a Corum watch ranges from $1,500–$30,000+.\n\nIn 2008, the Main Event Bracelet had 291 diamonds, totalling 2.81 carats set in 168 grams of 18kt white gold. The other 54 event bracelets consisted of 55 diamonds, totalling 0.25 carats set in 80 grams of 14kt yellow gold.\n\nIn 2010, an Australian-based company OnTilt Designs Pty Ltd won a multi-year contract to become the official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. OnTilt jewelers decided that the 2010 bracelet design would return to the tradition of the 1970s and 1980s where the bracelet was a heavy piece of unadorned metal. American jewelry designer Steve Soffa was chosen to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets. The goal was to create a bracelet that somebody would actually want to wear every day. In 2011, OnTilt has also been chosen to manufacture the WSOP Circuit rings.\n\nIn 2012, Jason Arasheben, famed jewelry designer and owner of Jason of Beverly Hills was chosen as the official bracelet manufacturer of the WSOP. Arasheben had designed the championship rings for the 2009 and 2010 Los Angeles Lakers and the 2011 Green Bay Packers, among others. The Main Event bracelet will feature each suit in the deck in either rubies or black diamonds. In terms of sheer mass, it weighs in at over 160 grams of 14 karat gold and over 35 carats of flawless diamonds.\n\nA special platinum bracelet was awarded at the 2012 WSOP to the winner of The Big One for One Drop, Antonio Esfandiari. The event was a $1 million buy-in tournament created as a fundraiser for the One Drop Foundation, a charity established by Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté.\n\nAt first, the bracelets did not have much prestige. Ten-time bracelet winner Doyle Brunson said that his first bracelet \"didn't mean anything\" to him and that he did not even pick up two of them.\n\nSome professional poker players believe that there are two types of poker players; those who have won a bracelet and those who have not. Those who have belong to an exclusive club. \"It's impossible to overstate the value of a World Series of Poker gold bracelet to anyone who takes the game seriously,\" stated World Series of Poker Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack during the 2006 bracelet unveiling. \"It is the equivalent of winning the Stanley Cup in hockey or the Lombardi Trophy in American football.\"\n\nMany professional poker players desire the recognition that is associated with the bracelet. Former Celebrity Poker Showdown host and poker star Phil Gordon said, \"I want that bracelet more than anything.\" Freddy Deeb said that he did not appreciate his first bracelet because he did not recognize what it meant. He said his 2007 bracelet, however, \"means everything to me\". Jennifer Tilly says that winning her 2005 Women's Championship bracelet was \"better than an Oscar\".\n\nWhen the World Poker Tour decided to offer a prize to its event champions, they decided to present them with WPT Bracelets. In so doing, WPT Founder, President and CEO Steve Lipscomb said, \"The championship bracelet has become synonymous with poker as a symbol of achievement and respect, and we are honored to continue the tradition that Benny Binion [the founder of the WSOP] began over 30 years ago.\"\n\nBracelets have not always been awarded for winning events. In 1970, the first WSOP Champion received nothing but a silver cup and whatever cash he won during the event. From 1971–1974, according to Becky Behnen (the daughter of WSOP founder Benny Binion), the winner received an undescribed \"corny trophy\". In 1975, the winners received a sterling plate. The following year, 1976, the WSOP started the tradition of issuing bracelets to the event winners.\n\nIn 1980 and 1981, one did not have to win a WSOP event to win a gold bracelet. In 1980 and 1981, H.D. \"Oklahoma Johny\" Hale and Chip Reese received a gold bracelet for being the \"Best All Around Player\" at the WSOP, respectively. These bracelets, however, are not considered in the count of WSOP championship bracelets.\n\nIn 2007, Thomas Bihl became the first person to ever win a WSOP bracelet outside Las Vegas, Nevada. Bihl won the £2,500 World Championship H.O.R.S.E. at the World Series of Poker Europe in London, England. Days later, Annette Obrestad became the youngest player to ever win a WSOP bracelet at 18 years, 364 days, also becoming the first woman to win a World Series Main Event (WSOPE). Caesars Entertainment (known until 2010 as Harrah's Entertainment), the owner of the WSOP, considers the WSOP Europe bracelet to be the same in prestige as those awarded every year in Las Vegas.\n\nIn 2008, Jesper Hougaard became the first person to have won both a WSOP and WSOPE bracelet.\n\nIn 2011, a World Series of Poker bracelet was awarded for the first time to the WSOP Circuit National Championship winner in the 100-qualifier event from May 27–29. The following year, the Circuit National Championship moved to New Orleans, where it will also be held in 2013.\n\nStarting in 2013, bracelets are also awarded in Australia at the World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific, held at Crown Melbourne.\n\nOf the three top WSOP bracelet winners, only Johnny Chan still has them all. He keeps them locked in a vault because they are worth, according to him, \"millions\". Brunson did not pick up two of his. Fifteen-time bracelet winner Phil Hellmuth gave away ten of his. \"To me,\" Hellmuth said, \"the bracelets have always been a really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, because I knew that they represented history.\"\n\nThree-time WSOP Bracelet winner Hamid Dastmalchi and six-time winner Ted Forrest had been playing for four days non-stop at the Mirage when Hamid started to complain about the 1992 Main Event Championship Bracelet he received. Bitter about a dispute with the Binion's Horseshoe, the owners of the WSOP at the time, Hamid told the table that the Binion's \"say it's worth $5,000, but I'd take $1,500 for it.\" To which Forrest responded \"Sold\" and immediately tossed Hamid $1,500 in chips. Dastmalchi mailed Forrest his bracelet. Ted Forrest also reported that three of his five bracelets have been stolen over the years, and that he gave his daughter one.\n\nIn November 2010, Peter Eastgate put his main event bracelet up for auction on eBay with a starting bid of $16,000. It eventually sold for $147,500 and this money was donated to UNICEF.\n\nThe top bracelet winners are as follows:\nThe bracelet leaders by decade are:\n\nJohnny Moss, with a win at the 1971 WSOP, became the first person to have won multiple lifetime WSOP \"bracelets\" (as mentioned above, the first actual bracelet was given in 1976).\n\nMoss also was the first person to win five lifetime WSOP bracelets, with a win at the 1975 WSOP.\n\nJohnny Chan, with a win in Event No. 25 at the 2005 World Series of Poker, became the first person to win 10 lifetime WSOP bracelets, just a few days before Doyle Brunson won his 10th bracelet in Event No. 31 of that same WSOP.\n\nThe first person to win two bracelets in the same WSOP was Johnny Moss at the 1971 WSOP.\n\nThe first person to win three bracelets in the same WSOP was Walter \"Puggy\" Pearson, at the 1973 WSOP. As of the start of the 2016 WSOP, only five other players have won three bracelets in a single WSOP.\n\nBill Boyd and Doyle Brunson are the only players to have won bracelets in four consecutive years (Boyd from 1971 to 1974, and Brunson from 1976 to 1979).\n\nIn 2005, the WSOP started hosting Circuit Events at many of their casinos around the country. In order to differentiate these events and to ensure the prestige of the WSOP Bracelet, the circuit events present a ring to the winners. In 2011, the WSOP awarded a bracelet to the winner of the Circuit Event National Championship. The Circuit Event National Championship was an invitation only event that used the standings of players from the various circuit events in determining who was invited.\n\nStarting with the 2011 WSOP Circuit, the Circuit National Championship was held as a closed event for participants of various circuit events.\n\nStarting in 2012, qualification for the Circuit National Championship was significantly changed. A total of 100 players now receive automatic seats in the National Championship. The winners of each Circuit main event and the highest point earner at each circuit stop receive seats, with the remaining automatic seats filled by the top points earners throughout the Circuit season who are not already qualified. Additionally, the top 100 players in the \"WSOP World Rankings\", a points race determined on results in open events of the previous two WSOPs, are eligible to enter. The Circuit qualifiers play the National Championship on a freeroll, while the WSOP World Rankings qualifiers must pay a $10,000 buy-in.\n\nThe winner of the Circuit National Championship wins a World Series of Poker bracelet.\n\n"}
