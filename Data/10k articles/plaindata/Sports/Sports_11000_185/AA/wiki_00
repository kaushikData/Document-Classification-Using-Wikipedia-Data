{"id": "754455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=754455", "title": "Braves Field", "text": "Braves Field\n\nBraves Field was a baseball park in the Northeastern United States, located in Boston, Massachusetts. Today the site is home to Nickerson Field on the campus of Boston University. The stadium was home of the Boston Braves of the National League from 1915–1952, prior to the Braves' move to Milwaukee in 1953. The stadium hosted the 1936 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and Braves home games during the 1948 World Series. The Boston Red Sox used Braves Field for their home games in the 1915 and 1916 World Series since the stadium had a larger seating capacity than Fenway Park. Braves Field was the site of Babe Ruth's final season, playing for the Braves in 1935. From 1929 to 1932, the Boston Red Sox played select regular season games periodically at Braves Field. On May 1, 1920, Braves Field hosted the longest major league baseball game in history – 26 innings, which eventually ended in a 1–1 tie.\n\nBraves Field was also home to multiple professional football teams between 1929 and 1948, including the first home of the National Football League (NFL) franchise that became the Washington Redskins. The pro football Braves played at the ballpark in their inaugural season of 1932, then were at Fenway Park for four seasons as the Boston Redskins before the move south in 1937 to Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C.\n\nLocated on Commonwealth Avenue at Babcock Street, the baseball field was aligned northeast, much as Fenway Park has been since it opened in April 1912. Most of the stadium was demolished in 1955, but significant portions of the original structure still stand and make up part of the Nickerson Field sports complex on the campus of Boston University.\n\nWhile built for baseball and having a rich baseball history, Braves Field briefly served as host for football teams. Braves Field was one of two homes (with Fenway Park) of the Boston Bulldogs of the first American Football League (in 1926) and the Boston Shamrocks of the second AFL (in 1936 and 1937). The National Football League's Pottsville Maroons were sold and relocated to Braves Field in 1929 as the Boston Bulldogs. In 1932, Braves Field became home of the football Boston Braves, a National Football League expansion franchise, owned by George Preston Marshall. The next year, after a 4–4–2 season, the Boston Braves Football franchise moved to Fenway Park and changed its name to the Redskins. In 1937 the franchise relocated and become today's Washington Redskins. Later, the Boston Yanks played a few games at Braves Field when Fenway Park was unavailable. The team was also the home of the USFL's Boston Breakers in the early 80's.\n\nBefore the Braves became the first modern-era franchise to relocate, in 1952, the Boston Braves franchise had been in Boston since 1871. Before Braves Field, the franchise had played at South End Grounds, with play at Congress Street Grounds in 1894 while South End Grounds was rebuilt following the May 15, 1894 Roxbury Fire .\n\nShortly after the Boston Red Sox opened Fenway Park in 1912, Braves owner James Gaffney purchased the former Allston Golf Club, one mile west of Fenway Park to build a new park for the Braves. Construction of the $600,000 Braves Field began on March 20, 1915 and was completed before the end of the 1915 season. The park was constructed entirely of steel (approx 750 tons) and an estimated 8 million pounds of concrete. Braves Field officially opened on August 18, 1915 with 46,000 in attendance to see the Braves defeat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-1. Braves Park was the largest stadium built in that era, with 40,000 capacity and a trolley system leading to the park.\n\nBraves Field was nicknamed \"The Wigwam\" by fans. Later it was nicknamed \"The Bee Hive\" and the name changed to National League Park, from 1936–1941, a period during which the owners changed the nickname of the team to the Boston Bees. The renaming of the team and stadium were both eventually dropped. During this span, it hosted the fourth Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1936. With its capacity to hold more fans than Fenway Park, Braves Field was used by the Red Sox in the 1915 and 1916 World Series; with Braves Field still under construction, the Braves had used Fenway Park for their World Series Title in 1914.\nLooking at design, James Gaffney wanted to see the game played in a wide open field conducive to allowing numerous inside-the-park home runs. Thus, the stadium was built in what was, at the time, the outskirts of Boston, in a large rectangular plot, contrasting with the cozy and lopsided block containing Fenway Park. The stands were almost entirely in foul territory, leaving little in the outfield to which players could hit a home run into – with the fences over away down the lines and nearly to dead center, hitting the ball over the outer fences was all but impossible during the dead-ball era. A stiff breeze coming in from center field across the Charles River further lessened any chances of seeing home runs fly out of the park. The only possible target in the outfield was a small bleacher section, which came to be known as \"The Jury Box\" after a sportswriter noticed during one slow mid-week game that there were only twelve individuals sitting in the 2,000-seat stand. Ty Cobb visited the park and commented, \"Nobody will ever hit a ball out of this park.\" The large foul ground area further favored the pitchers.\n\nIt took seven years and a livelier ball before a batter hit a home run that cleared the outer wall on the fly. New York Giants catcher Frank Snyder hit the first major league home run in the history of Braves Field in when he cleared the left field foul pole. Meanwhile, it remained a pitchers' park, perhaps never more so than on May 1, 1920, when Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Leon Cadore and Braves pitcher Joe Oeschger locked horns for a pair of complete-game performances that went on for a still-record 26 innings. After all that work, the game ended in a 1–1 tie, called on account of darkness.\n\nAt the advent of the lively ball era, it became clear that the fans were unhappy with Gaffney's vision of how baseball should be played, and inner fences were built, and regularly moved, being moved in and out based on whims. Later, the ownership of the team even went so far as to shift the entire field in a clockwise direction (towards right field) at one point. One year after opening Braves Field, Gaffney had sold the Braves, but kept Braves Field. Gaffney and his heirs then leased the stadium out to Braves owners until 1949, when his heirs sold it back to the Braves for approx. $750,000.\n\nOn Sunday, September 21, 1952, the Brooklyn Dodgers defeated the Braves, 8–2, before 8,822 fans in the final Major League game at Braves Field. Roy Campanella hit the last home run to help Joe Black defeat a Braves team with 20 year-old rookie Eddie Mathews hitting 3rd.\n\nAfter purchasing the Braves from Bob Quinn in 1945, owner Lou Perini, citing low attendance, moved the Braves to Milwaukee just prior to the 1953 season, leaving Braves Field vacant. The Braves had drawn fewer than 300,000 fans in 1952, after drawing over 1 million in 1947,1948 and 1949. Milwaukee had been the site of the Braves' Minor League team, the Milwaukee Brewers, and the Braves had earlier blocked an attempt by the St. Louis Browns to move to Milwaukee. With the Braves gone, Boston University quickly purchased the former home of the Braves on July 30, 1953, renaming it Boston University Field and utilizing it for their student athletes, a usage that remains today. The remaining scoreboard was sold and was moved to Kansas City Municipal Stadium.\n\nThe old ballpark was used as-is until 1955, when Boston University reconfigured the stands and the grounds. The remodel replaced all but the pavilion grandstand at the end of the right field line, which was retained as the seating core of a football, soccer, field hockey, and track-and-field stadium. The stadium was initially called \"Boston University Field\" and later renamed Nickerson Field. Along with the pavilion, the original outer wall was retained, though a portion of that wall along what is now Harry Agganis Way was replaced with wrought iron fencing in 2008. The stadium's ticket office was converted into the Boston University police station. The rest of the stadium structure was replaced by dormitories covering the former main grandstand; and the Case Physical Education Center, which houses Walter Brown Arena and Case Gym in the vicinity of what was the left field pavilion along Babcock Street. Of the demolished Jewel Box ballparks, Braves Field has the largest proportion of visible remnants still standing, as no other former ballpark has any portion of its seating still in use.\n\nWorld Series games were played at Braves Field in 1915, 1916, and 1948. The Boston Red Sox played their home games in the 1915 and 1916 World Series at the new Braves Field, as its capacity at the time was larger than Fenway Park, while the Braves hosted three games of the 1948 World Series.\n\nThe Red Sox defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 4 games to 1 to win the 1915 World Series. On Monday, October 11, the Red Sox won Game 3 at Braves Field, 2–1, in front of 42,300. The next day, the Red Sox won Game 4 in front of 41,096, also 2–1. As a young pitcher on the Red Sox, Babe Ruth only appeared in the series once, as a pinch hitter, going 0–1 in Game 1.\n\nThe following year, the Red Sox played the Brooklyn Robins in the 1916 World Series. In Game 1, the Red Sox defeated Brooklyn, 6–5, at Braves Field in front of 36,117. On Monday, October 9, Boston left-hander Babe Ruth pitched against Sherry Smith in front of 47,373. Ruth and Smith dueled for 14 innings, before Ruth and the Red Sox won in the bottom of the 14th, 2–1. The Red Sox won their second consecutive World Series with a 4–1 victory in Game 5 at Braves Field, with 43,620 in attendance.\n\nIn 1948, the Boston Braves captured the National League pennant with 91 wins. The Braves then played the Cleveland Indians in the World Series, losing 4 games to 2. Two future Hall-of-Famers led their teams as Managers, Lou Boudreau of Indians and Billy Southworth leading the Braves. The 1948 Braves were led by pitchers Johnny Sain and Hall-of-Famer Warren Spahn. In Game 1, on October 6, Sain beat Bob Feller of the Indians, 1–0, at Braves Field in front of 40,135. The Indians took Game 2, 4–1, the next day at Braves Field, with Bob Lemon beating Spahn with 39,633 in attendance. Game 2 also made television history when a live broadcast of the game was shown to passengers of the B&O Railroad's train traveling between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The Braves and Indians returned to Boston for Game 6 on Monday October 11, 1948. The Indians defeated the Braves, 4–3, in front of 40,103 to capture the championship.\n\nOn July 7, 1936 the 1936 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played at Braves Field, with 25,566 in attendance. The National League defeated the American League, 4–3, in the 4th All-Star game, featuring over 20 future Major League Baseball Hall of Fame members.\n\nLefty Grove and Dizzy Dean were the starting pitchers for managers Joe McCarthy of the New York Yankees and Charlie Grimm of the Chicago Cubs. Lou Gehrig hit a home run for the American League, batting behind rookie Joe DiMaggio in the lineup. Among others, Luke Appling, Bill Dickey, Joe Cronin, Schoolboy Rowe, Jimmie Foxx, Rick Ferrell, Earl Averill and Charlie Gehringer were selected for the American League. The National League roster included Billy Herman, Joe Medwick, Gabby Hartnett, Arky Vaughan, Goose Goslin, Leo Durocher, Ernie Lombardi, Mel Ott and Carl Hubbell.\n\nOn Saturday, May 1, 1920, at Braves Field, the Braves and Brooklyn Robins played 26 complete innings in a game that ended in a 1–1 tie, called due to darkness by home plate umpire Barry McCormick. It is the longest game, by innings, in Major League history. Starting pitchers Leon Cadore (Brooklyn) and Joe Oeschger (Boston) both pitched the entire game in front of 4,500 fans. The 26 innings by both pitchers is also a record, and it is conservatively estimated that each threw at least 300 pitches. Oeschager threw 21 consecutive scoreless innings in the game, Cadore threw 20. Second baseman Charlie Pick of the Braves went 0–11, the worst single day at the plate in MLB history. Cadore faced 95 Braves hitters, while Oeschager faced 90 hitters.\n\nBrooklyn and the Braves met again on Monday, May 3, after an off-day for the Braves. That game lasted another 19 innings, a 2–1 Boston win. In between, on Sunday, May 2, Brooklyn played at home against Philadelphia (a 4–3 Brooklyn win) in a game that went 13 innings. This gave Brooklyn 58 innings played in three days and three games.\n\nThere were four no-hitters pitched at Braves Field, none of them was a perfect game;\n\nThere were only two three-home-run games at Braves Field;\n\nAs noted above, the fences were moved repeatedly throughout the ballpark's existence, sometimes within a given season.\n\n\n"}

Campbell Field, is an American college football stadium located in Golden, Colorado. The stadium serves as the home field of the Colorado Mines Orediggers football team representing the Colorado School of Mines. Campbell Field is one of the oldest football fields in existence, the oldest west of the Mississippi River and the oldest in NCAA Division II. Originally it was a dirt surface all-purpose athletic field in exactly its current configuration, built within a clay pit, a fitting mined-out home for the Orediggers. Its first athletic contest, held on May 20, 1893, was the first annual Colorado Inter-Collegiate Athletic Association Field Day, featuring many athletic contests between the University of Colorado, Colorado A&M, Colorado School of Mines, and the University of Denver, in which Mines claimed the most medals. Its first football game took place on October 7, 1893, a 6-0 Mines victory over the University of Denver. It has been home to the football Orediggers through all but the first five seasons of their existence (their previous home were the now-destroyed grounds at the southeast corner of 19th and Illinois streets in Golden), and has been renovated several times throughout its existence. The field was originally called Athletic Park, renamed Brooks Field after Mines trustee and benefactor Ralph D. Brooks in 1922, and renamed Campbell Field after 1939 undefeated team member and benefactor Harry D. Campbell in 2010. Harry D. Campbell also was a football teammate of the legendary Jackie Robinson at Pasadena Junior College. Campbell Field is the oldest football field in the west, the oldest in NCAA Division II football and the 5th oldest college football field in the nation.\n\nHistoric photographs show Brooks Field as a dirt surface, without grandstands and surrounded by a board fence. Despite such conditions it is known to have hosted crowds of spectators, who could have used nearby slopes to view games from. Later early wooden grandstands were added to the park. In 1922 and 1924 the current grandstands were built by noted local builder William \"Cement Bill\" Williams. This featured wooden bench seats upon a steel superstructure, with home and visiting locker rooms, public restrooms and refreshment stand beneath. In 1922 the dirt surface was converted to natural grass, part of which was scraped back to dirt surface for a baseball diamond during season each year. Originally home also to the CSM baseball team, it became a primarily football facility in 1937 after baseball was moved to Darden Field just to the west. During the 1930s a Federal Emergency Relief Administration project scooped out the slopes at the west side of Brooks Field to make room to construct a track around the surface, and it has hosted track and field events since. Around the 1980s the grandstands were renovated to cover most wooden benches with metal surfaces and create a central concourse, along with steps down to the field level. In 2010, the field was converted to its third surface, synthetic turf. Plans are underway to replace the 90-year-old grandstands and update the historic field to a state-of-the-art Division II athletic facility, expanding its capacity to 5,000, to be rechristened Marv Kay Stadium at Campbell Field.\n\nCampbell Field has hosted many notable athletes and teams over its many years of play.

The club struggled in its early years, regularly having to play in qualification rounds in order to preserve its top flight status. In 2013, the club finished 7th of 8 teams, picking up only 7 points.

{"id": "1391642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1391642", "title": "Home Park", "text": "Home Park\n\nHome Park is a football stadium in Plymouth, England. The ground, nicknamed the Theatre of Greens, has been the home of Football League One club Plymouth Argyle since 1901. \n\nAfter undergoing considerable development in the 1920s and 1930s, the ground suffered heavy damage in World War II. It reopened in time for the resumption of the Football League in 1945, and underwent further improvements in the 1950s, including the installation of floodlights and a new double-decker grandstand. The ground remained relatively unchanged until 2001, when construction of three new all-seater stands began. The work was completed in 2002, and after further work the stadium became all-seater in the summer of 2007.\n\nThe stadium's record attendance was in 1936, when 43,596 spectators watched the club play a Second Division match against Aston Villa. The record average attendance for a single season, 23,290, came in the 1946–47 season. The stadium was selected as part of England's 2018 FIFA World Cup bid by the FA in December 2009. The ground has played host to England youth internationals, and a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup match between Saint-Étienne and Manchester United in 1977. Home Park has also hosted Rugby union and athletics, and live music in the summer, with Elton John, George Michael and Rod Stewart among the acts who have performed at the ground.\n\nThe Mayflower stand, known as the Grandstand, is currently closed for redevelopment. The other three stands are very similar in design and are linked together at the corners, having been built in 2001.\n\nThe Devonport End houses the more vocal of the club's supporters. The Lyndhurst Stand is the largest of the three stands, holding about 7,000 spectators, including the corners. The corner towards the East side of the ground is now the dedicated family corner. The Barn Park End is where the away supporters are housed. It holds about 3,000 spectators. The standard allocation given to visiting clubs had previously been 1,300, and this had been increased in the past whenever demand required it. although only 1,300 tickets were issued to away fans for the upcoming 2018-19 season. \n\nAll three stands have good views and standard facilities for a football stadium, including concourses, merchandise stands and food and drink outlets. The pitch measures about 100 metres (109 yards) long by 66 metres (72 yards) wide, with a few metres of run-off space on each side. The ground also has two pitch covers, rain and frost, to protect the pitch against adverse winter weather.\n\nHome Park was originally used by the now defunct Devonport Albion rugby team from 1893 to 1898. Following a dispute with the ground's owners over rent, Albion left and the ground was not used for three years. In 1901 the Argyle Athletic Club obtained a lease on the ground, then an oval-shaped bowl and cinder track surrounded by allotments and farmland. The new owners staged their first event, an athletics meeting, on Whit Monday in 1901, however, leaseholder Clarence Spooner was keen for it to stage football. Following a series of successful trial matches involving Argyle Football Club, which attracted healthy crowds, Spooner made the decision to focus on establishing the first professional football club in Devon. The club, formed in 1886, changed its name to Plymouth Argyle in 1903 and became professional that same year. Home Park played host to its first competitive match, against Northampton Town, on 5 September 1903 in front of a crowd of 4,438. At the time the ground had one wooden grandstand which could accommodate 2,000 people, while the other three sides of the ground were surrounded by slag heap banking with a waist-high fence. When Argyle joined the Football League in 1920 several improvements were required to meet safety requirements.\n\nThe wooden grandstand was demolished and replaced by a much larger and more modern structure at a cost of £12,000, while concrete terracing with crush barriers were added around the other three sides of the ground. A pitched roof was erected along the main entrance at the Devonport End of the ground, to provide cover for supporters using that terrace. The new grandstand incorporated players changing rooms and club offices. Many of these facilities were built with funds provided by the official supporters club. By the 1930s the ground was regularly hosting crowds in excess of 20,000 and on 10 October 1936 the record attendance was set. A crowd of 43,596 were in attendance to watch the club play out a 2–2 draw with Aston Villa in the Football League Second Division. The ground continued to host Second Division football until the outbreak of war in 1939.\n\nThe city of Plymouth was hit hard during the Second World War due to its strength as a military base: HMNB Devonport was the largest naval base in Western Europe. As the ground was so close to the city centre and Plymouth Sound, it was unlikely that it would escape unharmed. The Football League was abandoned three games into the 1939–40 season, but Home Park continued to host matches until summer 1940 in the hastily organised South West Regional League. In April 1941 there was a series of Luftwaffe bombing raids on the city, known as the Plymouth Blitz; Home Park did not escape. The Grandstand was all but destroyed after sustaining multiple hits and the pitch was littered with impact craters, which left the club facing a major rebuilding operation when the war ended in 1945.\n\nSeveral drastic measures were required to be ready for the resumption of a regionalised Football League in 1945. Disused army huts were used as changing rooms, buses and trams were used as offices, and railway sleepers were used for terracing. The Football League was still split into North and South divisions, having been created four years earlier in order for the League to continue whilst limiting the amount of travel by teams during the war. The 1945–46 season was its only full campaign. Records from this time tend not to be included in official records. Plymouth Argyle's first official match back at the ground for six years was played on 31 August 1946. 25,659 spectators watched a 3–1 victory against West Ham United in the Second Division.\n\nA new double-decker Grandstand was built in 1952, one of the last to be based on the template made popular during the 1920s and 30s by prolific football stadium architect Archibald Leitch, with floodlights installed in October 1953. Running the length of the pitch, it had standing room in the first tier, known as the Mayflower Terrace, and wooden seating in the second tier. When a roof was erected on the Lyndhurst side of the ground in 1964, three quarters of the ground were under cover, with all but the second tier of the Grandstand being standing room. In the 1969–70 season seats were added at the back of the Mayflower Terrace, which took the seating capacity to 4,100 and the overall capacity to 40,000. In the late 1970s the pitched roof at the Devonport End of the ground had to be removed for safety reasons. It was replaced in 1984 by a non-pitched structure, leaving just the Barn Park End uncovered.\n\nThe ground remained relatively unchanged throughout the 1990s, aside from the Lyndhurst Stand being made all-seater. However, its future seemed unclear when the club outlined plans to move to a new site in Central Park in 1996. The Plymouth Tradium, designed by Alfred McAlpine, would have seated 25,000, and also incorporated community sports and leisure facilities. In the end nothing came of it and the club instead focused on redeveloping Home Park, with many parts of the old ground showing their age by the start of the 21st century.\n\nA new plan, based on wholesale redevelopment of the existing ground, was announced in 2000 which at the time would cost an estimated £9m. The stadium would be built in two phases, with the first phase seeing the complete redevelopment of the Devonport End, Lyndhurst Stand, and Barn Park End. The second phase involved the Mayflower Grandstand which would be replaced by a new three-tiered structure to complete an 18,500 capacity all-seater bowl. The green light came in June 2001 when the club and Plymouth City Council agreed a new long-term lease for the ground. The building firm Barr Construction moved onto the site two months later.\n\nDuring the first six months of the 2001–2002 season supporters watched the club's matches from one touchline before the first phase was completed in February 2002. One of the biggest attendances since the redevelopment was set on 20 April 2002, as 18,517 spectators watched Plymouth Argyle recorded a 2–0 win against Cheltenham Town in the Third Division. A feat which was bettered in 2004, and then in 2007. Home Park attracted its highest average league attendance for over forty years during the 2004–05 season in the Championship, formerly known as the First Division. Despite this, a start date for the second phase of redevelopment would not materialise. The former chairman of Plymouth Argyle, Paul Stapleton, declared that not completing the project was the biggest disappointment of his tenure.\n\nThe club purchased the freehold of the ground from Plymouth City Council to become sole owners in December 2006 for £2.7m. It was hoped that work on a new Grandstand would begin the following year. It hosted its biggest crowd since the redevelopment in March 2007 when 20,652 were in attendance to watch Argyle play Watford in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. That summer the ground became all-seated as the club was forced to convert the Mayflower Terrace into seating by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. In the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 regulations were brought in, recommended by the Taylor report, that all stadiums in the top two divisions of English football must be all-seated unless there are exceptional circumstances. The club had been given three years grace after winning promotion back to the Football League Championship in 2004.\n\nThree major summer initiatives were announced by the club just over a week later, which were carried out over the next month. The Mayflower Terrace was replaced by temporary, unreserved seating with a capacity of 3,500. A new state-of-the-art public address system was installed, and the last of ground's iconic floodlight towers were dismantled after 54 years of service, with a new system put in its place. The capacity of the ground was therefore reduced by roughly two thousand to 19,500 following these changes.\n\nOn 4 March 2011, the club entered administration. As part of a rescue package, which saw South West hotelier James Brent take over the club, Plymouth City Council agreed to buy back the freehold for a reported £1.6m and lease the ground back to the club for an annual rent of £135,000. \n\nThe Mayflower Grandstand was the club's main stand, with space for about 7,000 spectators including the old terrace. It is the oldest part of the ground, having been built in 1952. It houses the club's main offices, the boardroom, team changing rooms and press rooms, and also accommodates executive boxes. The player tunnel sits slightly off centre going underneath the Mayflower, leading up towards the changing rooms. \n\nThere had been plans to replace this stand for a number of years. In 2013, planning permission was finally given to revamp and rebuild the Mayflower Grandstand. No work however was carried out until 2018 when the redevelopment of the Grandstand and the surrounding area began. The main redevelopment would include the fitting of new seats in the top tier, replacing the antiquated wooden ones, fitting new seats on the terrace, and replacing the roof. For players, there would be a new changing room block and a new tunnel to the East side of the ground in the corner of the Grandstand and the Barn Park End.\n\nThe Grandstand was subsequently shut to spectators for the entirety of the 2018-19 season, severely reducing Home Park's capacity. To each side of the stand there used to stand two separate buildings, to the east was the Chisholm Lounge which was used for hospitality, as a press area and was home to the Argyle disc jockey until its demolition in August 2018. Behind the Chisholm Lounge was the supporter's bar, known as the 'Far Post Club'. This was also demolished to make way for a new supporter's bar, to be funded by fan group 'The Green Taverners'. To the west of the Grandstand was a disabled enclosure, which too was demolished to make way for new buildings, this time for a new club shop.\n\nIn August 2009 the club announced plans for wholesale development of the stadium and regeneration throughout the area. The club declared that the city of Plymouth would be submitting an application to the Football Association (the FA) to be a host venue for England's 2018 FIFA World Cup Bid. The eye-catching plans were released to the public on 14 December 2009, two days before the FA would announce which candidates they had selected for the bid. The plans, designed by Populous, include developing the stadium into a 46,000 capacity all-seater area, with a 5,000-seat indoor facility and hotel built into the complex, at a cost of at least £50m. The build would be done in three stages. The First Phase, a new Mayflower Stand, will become a reality regardless of the bid, increasing the capacity to 27,000. The Second Phase, an additional 8,000 seats, and the Third Phase, an additional 11,000 seats, would be completed by the 2014–15 season should Plymouth's application and England's bid be successful, giving the stadium a capacity of 46,000 all-seated by this stage.\nThe city presented its bid at Wembley Stadium in November 2009 with numerous businesses and sports clubs from Devon and Cornwall fully behind it. A selection of those included the city's rugby union and basketball clubs, Plymouth Albion, and Plymouth Raiders, and local football clubs Exeter City, and Torquay United. Plymouth was selected as a part of England's 2018 FIFA World Cup Bid, alongside 11 other cities on 16 December 2009. Plymouth Argyle director Paul Stapleton described himself as being overwhelmed, going on to say that getting over the first hurdle \"gives our supporters belief that we can achieve things\", while the bids chairman, Douglas Fletcher, described the bid as one \"for the people of Devon and Cornwall\". A day later the club revealed that the stadium could possibly be renamed for sponsorship reasons as a part of funding for the project which shall begin in the summer of 2010.\n\nHowever, on 2 December 2010 England lost its World Cup bid to Russia. Following the failure of the World Cup bid, the consortium that had taken controlling interest in the club in 2009 quickly lost interest now property speculation was out of the question and a few months later the club entered administration.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted matches involving the England national team at various levels. The England Amateur team played a match against their Welsh counterparts in 1914. Home Park also hosted three England Under-23 matches in the 1960s and 1970s. A 6–1 win against Belgium in 1962, a 4–1 win against Bulgaria in 1970 and a 0–0 draw with Poland in 1973. In March 2015, more than 11,000 people watched the England U-20s play out a 2-1 friendly win over the USA U-20s. The ground hosted a unique match in 1966 between representative sides of the Football League and Irish Football League. A crowd of 35,458 were in attendance as the Football League, featuring seven members of the 1966 FIFA World Cup winning squad, were 12–0 victors. Home Park has also been used for purposes other than football. Before Argyle moved in, the site was used for rugby union matches, and it hosted an athletics meeting in the early 20th century.\n\nOn 5 October 1977, Home Park hosted Manchester United's European Cup Winners' Cup first round second leg tie against AS Saint-Etienne of France. United won the game 2–0 (3–1 on aggregate). Despite being based nearly 300 miles away at Old Trafford in Manchester, United had played their \"home\" tie at Home Park as UEFA had ordered them to play at least 120 miles from Old Trafford due to hooliganism incidents at the first leg in France, for which they had initially been expelled from the competition completely and only readmitted on appeal.\n\nPlymouth Argyle was limited in what it could do with the stadium throughout the 1900s, because of a long-standing lease agreement with the City Council. That changed in 2006 when the club purchased the freehold of the ground for £2.7m. Soon after, the club announced it would begin hosting live music in the summer months, starting in 2007, and the first act to perform there was Elton John. Other major acts have followed, including George Michael, Meat Loaf, Westlife, and Rod Stewart. The stadium also hosts an annual free-admittance carol service in December to celebrate Christmas, in association with the Plymouth branch of Christian organisation Faith and Football.\n\nIn July 2018, with help from Plymouth City Council, the ground was used to screen England's World Cup semi-final defeat to Croatia at no charge for spectators.\n\nThe highest attendance recorded at Home Park is 43,596 for a Football League Second Division match between Plymouth Argyle and Aston Villa on 10 October 1936. This was before the ground was converted to an all-seater stadium, allowing many more people to fit into the stadium. Home Park's record attendance as an all-seater stadium currently stands at 17,511, set at a Football League Championship match between Plymouth Argyle and Watford on 22 March 2008. Home Park's record attendance for a non-competitive match is 37,639, for a mid-season friendly between Plymouth Argyle and Santos on 14 March 1973. The lowest recorded attendance for a competitive match at Home Park was 944, set on 10 December 1996, for a Football League Trophy first round tie between Plymouth Argyle and Bournemouth. The highest average attendance at Home Park over a League season is 23,290, set in the 1946–47 season. The lowest average attendance at Home Park came in the 1982–83 season, when an average of 4,537 spectators watched each match.\n\nAdjacent to the Devonport End of the stadium is the Milehouse Park and ride car park, with numerous services provided by Stagecoach South West serving the City Centre all the way up to Tavistock. Target Travel run three football special buses on matchdays serving Plympton via the A38, Plymstock via Mutley Plain, and the George Junction Park & Ride to the north of the city. The stadium is on Outland Road, which links to the A38 dual-carriageway with direct access to Cornwall and the north of England. On foot, the stadium is approximately 1.6 miles (2.5 km) from Plymouth railway station and 1.8 miles (2.8 km) from the city centre.\n\n"}

{"id": "979488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=979488", "title": "Ice rink", "text": "Ice rink\n\nAn ice rink (or ice skating rink) is a frozen body of water and/or hardened chemicals where people can ice skate or play winter sports. Besides recreational ice skating, some of its uses include ice hockey, bandy, rink bandy, ringette, broomball, speed skating, figure skating, ice stock sport and curling as well as exhibitions, contests and ice shows. There are two types of rinks in prevalent use today: natural, where freezing occurs from cold ambient temperatures, and artificial (or mechanically frozen), where a coolant produces cold temperatures in the surface below the water, causing the water to freeze. There are also synthetic ice rinks where skating surfaces are made out of plastics.\n\n\"Rink\", a Scottish word meaning 'course', was used as the name of a place where curling was played. The name has been retained for the construction of ice areas for other sports and uses.\n\nEarly attempts at the construction of artificial ice rinks were first made in the 'rink mania' of 1841–44. As the technology for the maintenance of natural ice did not exist, these early rinks used a substitute consisting of a mixture of hog's lard and various salts. An item in the 8 May 1844 issue of Eliakim Littell's \"Living Age\" headed \"The Glaciarium\" reported that \"This establishment, which has been removed to Grafton street East' Tottenham Court Road, was opened on Monday afternoon. The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating\".\nBy 1844, these venues fell out of fashion, as customers grew tired of the 'smelly' ice substitute, and it was only thirty years later, that refrigeration technology developed to the point that natural ice could finally be feasibly used in the rink. The world's first mechanically frozen ice rink was the \"Glaciarium\", opened by John Gamgee in a tent in a small building just off the Kings Road in Chelsea, London, on 7 January 1876. In March, it moved to a permanent venue at 379 Kings Road, where a rink measuring was established.\n\nThe rink was based on a concrete surface, with layers of earth, cow hair and timber planks. Atop these were laid oval copper pipes carrying a solution of glycerine with ether, nitrogen peroxide and water. The pipes were covered by water and the solution was pumped through, freezing the water into ice. Gamgee discovered the process while attempting to develop a method to freeze meat for import from Australia and New Zealand, and patented it as early as 1870.\nGamgee operated the rink on a membership-only basis and attempted to attract a wealthy clientele, experienced in open-air ice skating during winters in the Alps. He installed an orchestra gallery, which could also be used by spectators, and decorated the walls with views of the Swiss Alps.\n\nThe rink initially proved a success, and Gamgee opened two further rinks later in the year: at Rusholme in Manchester and the \"Floating Glaciarium\" at Charing Cross in London, this last significantly larger at . The Southport Glaciarium opened in 1879, using Gamgee's method.\n\nIn Germany, the first ice skating rink opened in 1882 in Frankfurt during a patent exhibition. It covered 520m and operated for two months; the refrigeration system was designed by Linde, and it was probably the first skating rink where Ammonia was used as a refrigerant. Ten years later, a larger rink was permanently installed on the same site.\n\nThe oldest indoor artificial ice rink still in existence (built 1909-10) and in use is the one in Boston's Matthews Arena, on the campus of Northeastern University.\n\nMany ice rinks consist of, or are found on, open bodies of water such as lakes, ponds, canals, and sometimes rivers; these can only be used in the winter in climates where the surface would freeze thickly enough to support human weight. Rinks can also be made in cold climates by enclosing a level area of ground, filling it with water, and letting it freeze. Snow may even be packed to use as a containment material.\n\nA famous example of this type of rink is the Rideau Canal Skateway in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, estimated at and long, which is equivalent to 90 Olympic size skating rinks. The rink is prepared by lowering the canal's water level and letting the canal water freeze. The rink is then resurfaced nightly by cleaning the ice of snow and flooding it with water from below the ice. The rink is recognized as the \"world's largest naturally frozen ice rink\" by the Guinness Book of World Records because \"its entire length receives daily maintenance such as sweeping, ice thickness checks and there are toilet and recreational facilities along its entire length\".\n\nThe longest ice skating trail can be found in Invermere, British Columbia, Canada, on Lake Windermere Whiteway. The naturally frozen trail measures .\n\nIn any climate, an arena ice surface can be installed in a properly built space. This consists of a bed of sand or occasionally a slab of concrete, through (or on top of) which pipes run. The pipes carry a chilled fluid (usually either a salt brine or water with antifreeze, or in the case of smaller rinks, refrigerant) which can lower the temperature of the slab so that water placed atop will freeze. This method is known as 'artificial ice' to differentiate from ice rinks made by simply freezing water in a cold climate, indoors or outdoors, although both types are of frozen water. A more proper technical term is 'mechanically frozen' ice.\n\nA famous example of this type of rink is the outdoor rink at Rockefeller Center in New York.\n\nModern rinks have a specific procedure for preparing the surface. With the pipes cold, a thin layer of water is sprayed on the sand or concrete to seal and level it (or in the case of concrete, to keep it from being marked). This thin layer is painted white or pale blue for better contrast; markings necessary for hockey or curling are also placed, along with logos or other decorations. Another thin layer of water is sprayed on top of this. The ice is built up to a thickness of 3/4ths an inch to 1 1/2 inches. The industry standard in the NHL is around 1 1/2\".\n\nSynthetic rinks are constructed from a solid polymer material designed for skating using normal metal-bladed ice skates. High density polyethelene (HDPE) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW) are the only materials that offer reasonable skating characteristics, with UHMW synthetic rinks offering the most ice-like skating but also being the most expensive. A typical synthetic rink will consist of many panels of thin surface material assembled on top of a sturdy, level and smooth sub-floor (anything from concrete to wood or even dirt or grass) to create a large skating area.\n\nPeriodically after the ice has been used, it is resurfaced using a machine called an ice resurfacer (sometimes colloquially referred to as a Zamboni – referring to a major manufacturer of such machinery). For curling, the surface is 'pebbled' by allowing loose drops of cold water to fall onto the ice and freeze into rounded peaks.\n\nBetween events, especially if the arena is being used without need for the ice surface, it is either covered with a heavily insulated floor or melted by allowing the fluid in the pipes below the ice to warm.\n\nA highly specialized form of rink is used for speed skating; this is a large oval (or \"ring\") much like an athletic track. Because of their limited use, speed skating ovals are far less common than hockey or curling rinks.\n\nThose skilled at preparing arena ice are often in demand for major events where ice quality is critical. The popularity of the sport of hockey in Canada has led its icemakers to be particularly sought after. One such team of professionals was responsible for placing a loonie coin under center ice at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah; as both Canadian teams (men's and women's) won their respective hockey gold medals, the coin was christened \"lucky\" and is now in the possession of the Hockey Hall of Fame after having been retrieved from beneath the ice.\n\nIn bandy, the rink size is x . For internationals, the size must not be smaller than x . The variety rink bandy is played on ice hockey rinks.\n\nThe size of figure skating rinks can be quite variable, but the International Skating Union prefers Olympic-sized rinks for figure skating competitions, particularly for major events. These are 60 meters by 30 meters. The ISU specifies that competition rinks must not be larger than this and not smaller than 56 meters by 26 meters.\n\nThere are basically two rink sizes in use, although there is a great deal of variation in the dimensions of actual ice rinks. Historically, earlier ice rinks were smaller than today.\n\nOfficial National Hockey League rinks are . The dimensions originate from the size of the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nOfficial Olympic/International rinks have dimensions of .\n\nIn speed skating, for short track, the official Olympic rink size is 30 x 60 meters, with an oval ice track of 111.12 meters in circumference. In long track speed skating the oval ice track is usually 400 meters in circumference.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "569822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=569822", "title": "Infield fly rule", "text": "Infield fly rule\n\nThe infield fly rule is a rule of baseball that treats certain fly balls as though caught, before the ball is caught, even if the infielder fails to catch it or drops it on purpose. The umpire's declaration of an infield fly means that the batter is out (and all force plays are removed) regardless of whether the ball is caught. The rule exists to prevent the defense from achieving a double play or triple play by failing to catch a ball that an infielder could catch with ordinary effort. The rule is limited to apply only in situations where this result is possible.\n\nA ball batted into the air subjects baserunners to a dilemma. If the ball is caught, they must return to their original base; if not caught, the batter becomes a runner and certain runners are forced to advance to the next base. Baserunners study the fielder and advance only far enough from the base to ensure that they can return safely. If a presumed catch becomes a non-catch, forced runners must run forward instead of back. This creates an advantage for the defense in intentionally failing to execute an easy catch, which the infield fly rule exists to remove.\n\nThe infield fly rule is explained in the Official Baseball Rules in two places:\n\nThe rule applies only when there are fewer than two outs, and there is a force play at third base (i.e., when there are runners at first and second base, or the bases are loaded). In these situations, if a fair fly ball is in play, and in the umpire's judgment is catchable by an infielder with ordinary effort, the umpire shall call \"infield fly\" (or more often, \"infield fly, batter is out\") and the batter will be out regardless of whether the ball is actually caught. Umpires typically raise the right arm straight up, index finger pointing up, to signal the rule is in effect.\n\nIf \"infield fly\" is called and the fly ball is caught, it is treated exactly as an ordinary caught fly ball; the batter is out, there is no force, and the runners must tag up. On the other hand, if \"infield fly\" is called and the ball lands fair without being caught, the batter is still out, there is still no force, but the runners \"are not\" required to tag up. In either case, the ball is live, and the runners may advance on the play, at their own peril.\n\nAn infield fly may be declared by any umpire on the field.\n\nThe infield fly rule is a judgment call, as the rule states that \"The judgment of the umpire must govern\". The rule directs the umpire to declare an infield fly immediately on determining that the play meets the criteria described above, solely based on the umpire's discretion. Since different umpires may have different definitions of what constitutes \"ordinary effort,\" the rule may be applied differently depending on the umpire and game conditions.\n\nAny fair fly ball that could be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort is covered by the rule, whether or not it is in the infield, and whether or not an infielder catches it, or even attempts to catch it. For example, if an infielder retreats to the outfield in an effort to catch a fly ball, the infield fly rule may be invoked because the ball could have been caught by the infielder. Similarly, infield fly may also be called if an \"outfielder\" runs into the infield to catch a fly ball, if it could have been caught by an infielder with ordinary effort. It may be helpful to think of it as the \"\"infielder\" fly rule\". Specifically, the rule states an infield fly call should be determined by \"whether the ball could ordinarily have been handled by an infielder, not by some arbitrary limitation such as the grass, or the base lines. The umpire must rule also that a ball is an infield fly, even if handled by an outfielder, if, in the umpire's judgment, the ball could have been as easily handled by an infielder.\"\n\nThe term \"ordinary effort\" considers all circumstances, including weather, lighting, positioning of the defense, and the abilities of the players involved in the play. A fly ball catchable with ordinary effort in Major League Baseball might not be in a junior high school game, due to the ability of the players involved.\n\nIf the fly ball is near the foul lines, the umpire is to declare \"infield fly, if fair\". If the ball is not caught and ends up foul (including if it lands fair and then rolls foul before passing first or third base without being touched by a fielder), the infield fly call is canceled, and the play is treated as an ordinary foul ball. In contrast, if the ball lands foul and then rolls fair before passing first or third base without being touched, the infield fly takes effect and the batter is out.\n\nDeclarations of the infield fly rule are not included in the statistical summary of a baseball game and are not a separate category in player statistics.\n\nA fielder who misplays an infield fly is not charged with an error because the batter is out through the infield fly rule. In fact, the fielder who should have caught an infield fly earns a putout. But a fielder who fails to touch an infield fly that then rolls foul may be charged with an error for letting the ball roll foul; the batter is not out, and the misplay prolongs the batter's time at bat.\n\nThe rule was first introduced in 1895 by the National League in response to infielders intentionally dropping pop-ups to get multiple outs by forcing out the runners on base, who were pinned near their bases while the ball was in the air. At that time, the rule only applied with one man out.\n\nThe current rule came into effect in 1901. It was amended in 1904 to not apply to line drives, and in 1920 to not apply to bunts.\n\nIn the fifth game of the 2008 World Series between the Tampa Bay Rays and Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pedro Feliz of the Phillies hit a pop-up to the right side of the infield with runners on first and second and one out, in strong rain and swirling winds, and the infield fly rule was not invoked. Umpiring crew chief Tim Tschida explained that \"The infield fly rule requires the umpires' judgment to determine whether or not a ball can be caught with ordinary effort, and that includes wind\" and that the umpires' determination was that in this case there was no infielder who could make the play with \"ordinary effort\".\n\nIn the eighth inning of the 2012 National League Wild Card Game between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Atlanta Braves, Andrelton Simmons of the Braves hit a pop-up into shallow left field with one out and men on first and second bases. Cardinals shortstop Pete Kozma, who was playing in normal position, ran out to left field to catch the ball while left fielder Matt Holliday, who was playing very deep in left, ran in to catch it as well. Although Kozma initially called to catch the ball, as the ball came down, he suddenly moved out of the way and the ball fell between him and Holliday. While it initially appeared that Simmons (the batter) had safely reached first base and the Braves had the bases loaded with one out, Simmons was called out because left field umpire Sam Holbrook had called \"infield fly\" just before the ball hit the ground, and the Braves now had runners at second and third with two out, instead of bases loaded with one out. The Braves did not score in the inning, and the Cardinals went on to win the game, 6–3, eliminating the Braves from the postseason.\n\nAfter the call, angry Braves fans began throwing plastic bottles and other debris onto the field, causing the game to be delayed for nearly 20 minutes. The game was played by the Braves under an official protest from their manager, but shortly after the game, Joe Torre, MLB executive vice president for baseball operations, denied the protest, citing umpire's judgment. Torre made the ruling immediately following the game (waiving the normal 24-hour review period) due to the importance of the game and the quick turnaround time before the next playoff game. The spot where the ball had landed was 225 feet from home plate. In the past three MLB seasons, there were six infield-fly rulings on balls that weren't caught, and the longest was measured at 178 feet, which is 47 feet less than the ball Simmons hit.\n\nAs the infield fly rule is a special case, umpires signal one another at the start of an at-bat to remind one another that the game situation puts the rule into effect. A typical signal is to touch the brim of the cap so as to show the number of outs.\n\nThe infield fly rule is not in effect if there is no runner on second base. Provided the batter runs to first base, the greatest benefit the defense could achieve by intentionally letting the fly ball drop untouched is to force out the runner at second rather than the batter, resulting in a runner on first base either way. However, if the batter is significantly slower than the runner, the defense may elect to let the ball drop untouched and achieve the force play, replacing the runner at first base with the batter.\n\nRisks for the defense are that the uncaught ball may roll away from the fielder, and any runner on third base can try to score but has the option of remaining on his base.\n\nIf the batter gives up on the play, the defense can achieve outs at second base and first base by deliberately letting the ball drop untouched.\n\nA related rule called the intentional drop rule (Rule 5.09(a)(12)) applies even when second base is unoccupied (so long as first-base is occupied), and applies even when the batted ball is a line drive or a bunt that could be caught on the fly. This rule likewise prevents a fielder from deliberately dropping a ball and thereby achieving a double or triple play. If an umpire invokes this rule, the drop is ruled a catch, the ball is dead, and no baserunner may advance. The rule is not invoked when a fielder plays a ball on a bounce that might have been caught on the fly, or a fielder lets the ball fall to the ground without catching the palm of the mitt, or, in the judgment of the umpire, the ball was mishandled and not cleanly caught.\n\nFor the runners, an infield fly is little different from an ordinary fly ball. If an infield fly is caught, the runners must retouch their original bases (\"tag up\") after the catch before attempting to advance. If an infield fly is not caught, no tag up is required and the runners may advance at their own risk. The only difference is that the umpire's declaration that the batter is out removes force plays and gives runners the option of staying on the base.\n\nThe infield fly rule states that runners may advance \"after the ball is touched\". This rule governs the tag up if the infield fly is caught. The runner does not need to wait on base until the fielder achieves full control of the ball. There is no need to tag up at any time if the ball is dropped. There is no concept of tagging up under the intentional drop rule, as base advances are not allowed.\n\nA runner hit by an infield fly while standing on a base is also protected from being declared out due to interference, unless this interference is deemed intentional (which appeared in the rules in 1940).\n\nThe rulebook definition of Infield Fly says the umpire \"shall immediately declare 'Infield Fly' for the benefit of the runners.\" However, sometimes they do not. As in the anecdote above from 2008, there may be doubt as to whether the ball was catchable by an infielder with ordinary effort. If not called, the infield fly rule is not in effect. The same definition includes a comment that \"The infield fly is in no sense to be considered an appeal play.\" This suggests that the batter cannot be ruled out retroactively to settle a debate that occurs after the play ends. However, in Major League Baseball, the umpires are likely to correct their mistake if it leads to an unfair double or triple play. Baserunners should learn what options they have, both on a routine fly out and a fly out declared an infield fly. Fielders should understand that declaration of the infield fly rule removes the force play and that a runner is only out if tagged.\n\nIn adult baseball, a fly ball usually reaches the fielder before the batter can run the 90 feet to first base. However, in youth baseball, the distance between bases is shorter, and in some youth leagues, the infield fly rule is not in effect.\n\nIn this case, a baserunning gambit can be used to avoid a double or triple play. A fast batter may reach first base before the pop fly reaches the fielder. If the fielder fails to catch the ball, then the batter runs toward second base while the runner originally on first base remains there. Under Rule 7.08(h), the batter is out for passing a preceding runner, and under Rule 7.08(c), this out removes the force so that other runners are able to remain on their bases.\n\nThe infield fly rule was the subject of an article in U.S. legal history. William S. Stevens was a law student in 1975 when he anonymously published \"The Common Law Origins of the Infield Fly Rule\" in the \"University of Pennsylvania Law Review\". The article was humorous but also insightful on how common law related to codified regulation of behavior. It has been cited in numerous legal decisions and in subsequent literature.\n"}

It is the home field of the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team of the Big 12 Conference.\n\nClifford B. and Audrey Jones Stadium opened in 1947. The original seating capacity was 27,000.\n\nIn 1959 the stadium's first expansion raised the seating to 41,500. The existing east stands were moved a few feet at a time via steel rollers upon Santa Fe Railroad rails and moved further east, and the playing surface was lowered 28 feet below street level, to accommodate the new lower bowl. It was expanded again in 1972 with new red, metal seats on the north side bringing capacity of 48,000.\n\nThe largest renovation project to date was the construction of a $51.9 million, press box on the stadium's west side that included luxury suites, club seating and decks for television cameras and the press. The project added 2,000 seats and was completed during the 2003 season.\n\nThe stadium name was changed to Jones SBC Stadium in 2000 due to a naming rights agreement with SBC Communications, then being led by Texas Tech alumnus and CEO Edward Whitacre, Jr.. SBC Communications funded a large part of the stadium's West Stadium Club expansion. On April 6, 2006, the facility officially changed names again, this time to Jones AT&T Stadium as a result of SBC's purchase of AT&T Corporation and adoption of AT&T as its new corporate name.\n\nFor 2006, the stadium was upgraded with a $2 million inner field wall that matches the traditional Texas Tech style brick façade. An inscribing of the Matador Song at the Double T in the north and south end zones was also added.\n\nIn February 2006, the university announced plans to add $60 million worth of upgrades including additional luxury suites, a 1,000-car parking garage, an upper deck, a facade on the east side of the stadium and more seating. The entire project was set to begin following the 2006 season but was cancelled before being re-initiated as a different project in 2008.\n\nOn August 7, 2008, the Texas Tech Board of Regents announced a $25 million expansion project. The planned expansion added a Spanish Renaissance-themed façade to the east side of the stadium. In addition to the improvements to the exterior of the facility, the expansion added 1,000 general-admission seats, 550 club seats, and 26 suites. Texas Tech allocated a total of $19 million to the expansion and added another $6 million through fund-raising initiatives.\n\nOn November 20, 2008, university officials announced that the project's fundraising goal had been exceeded. Most of the money came from private donations, including a large contribution from AT&T and a $1M matching gift from Texas Tech System Board of Regents member, Larry Anders. A small amount of the funds was delegated to come from future ticket sales. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the expansion took place on November 29, 2008. Construction began following the 2008 season, and was completed in 2010, bringing the total amount of suites to 89 and seating capacity to 60,454.\n\nIn May 2009, it was announced an additional 6,100 seats would be added in the northeast and northwest end zones by mid-season. The additional general admission seating was opened in the north end of the stadium on October 24, 2009, bringing capacity at that time to 58,930.\n\nIn January 2013, construction began adding another 368 seats in the north end zone, in addition to an observation decks that holds 40. The $16 million project also included a significantly upgraded jumbotron with a new sound system, a Spanish Renaissance-themed colonnade, and a new north end zone concourse connecting the two stadium halves. Along with the other additions, 157 feet of ribbon board were added on the north end zone; more than 160 linear feet in the northeast and northwest corners of the stadium, and 94 lineal feet in the south end zone over the athletic offices. The construction was completed in November 2013.\n\nAs part of these renovations, the Double T scoreboard was also updated with new white LED panels and many seats in the stadium were repainted red. Additionally, AT&T completed an upgrade to its distributed antenna system in the stadium, increasing data capacity and call reliability.\n\nPrior to the 2016 season, the north end zone was further renovated. What was the ticket office was converted into a club area and premium loge seating was added outside. A remnant of the grass berm that originally encircled the north bowl was converted from grass to artificial turf as well.\n\nOn August 29, 2014, a $185 million fundraising campaign was announced for multiple athletic projects. It is the first solely athletic focused campaign started by the university. The headlining project of the campaign is a renovation of the south end zone athletic offices into a premium seating area with luxury suites. Replacing of stadium seatbacks and FieldTurf is also included in the project's budget.\n\nThe unique Double T scoreboard modeled in the fashion of Texas Tech's logo is emplaced on the roof of the athletic department offices in the south end zone and was installed prior to the beginning of the 1978 season. The scoreboard has remained in place through multiple stadium renovations due to its iconic and symbolic value, and received upgraded white LED panel installations in 2013.\n\nThe playing field runs in the traditional north-south configuration and sits 30 feet below grade at an elevation of above sea level.\n\nWhen the stadium opened in 1947, the playing field featured a grass playing surface until it was replaced with AstroTurf in 1970. In 2006, FieldTurf replaced the AstroTurf playing field.\n\nAfter numerous renovations and expansions, Jones AT&T Stadium currently seats 60,454. The capacity makes the stadium the 44th largest college football stadium in the United States. Officially, Jones AT&T Stadium has the third-highest seating capacity of any college-specific venue in Texas behind Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin and Kyle Field in College Station, but when referred to by actual seating capacity the stadium drops to fifth behind San Antonio's Alamodome and Houston's Rice Stadium.\n\nThere are 13,750 seats designated for students between 14 sections. An additional section was allotted to students following record demand during the 2013 season.\n\nDue for completion prior to the commencement of the 2013 season, the $11 million jumbotron mounted in the north end zone of the stadium is one of the largest in the country. The high-definition jumbotron measures 100 feet wide by 38 feet tall with 3,800 square feet of screen space, placing it at a ranking of 16th nationally by square footage in purely NCAA football stadiums, and 8th among HD screens. Additionally, the board ranks 3rd in the Big 12 Conference in square footage behind only the University of Texas at Austin's Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium and the University of Oklahoma's Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium.\n\nThe entire support structure measures 190 feet wide and 57 feet tall, making it the largest overall in the Big 12. The entire project includes 275 tons of steel above ground and 54 tons below ground, embedded in about 400 cubic yards of concrete. Six piers on each side of the structure plunge to a depth of near 50 feet. The video board, with a pixel pitch of 16mm and 4 megapixels, also includes sound banks 38 feet tall and 16 feet wide. The video board supports were covered with a decorative Spanish Renaissance architecture facade and feature wells for shooting pyrotechnics.\n\nThe Coaches All-America Game, a postseason college football all-star game that served as the concluding game of the college football season, was hosted at Jones AT&T Stadium from 1970–1975. The all-star game was sponsored by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) and profits from ticket sales and television rights went to fund AFCA scholarships. Prior to the Coaches All-America Game relocating to Lubbock, from 1961 to 1965, War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York, served as host and prior to relocating to Lubbock due to attendance issues, Atlanta Stadium hosted the game from 1966 to 1969. Lubbock won the bid to host the game over newer stadiums in larger cities, Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee and San Diego Stadium in San Diego, after the AFCA was convinced that Lubbock's advantages as a college town without competing entertainment would fill the stands with existing college football fans from West Texas.\n\nThe first game held at Jones Stadium took place only 47 days after downtown Lubbock was hit by a tornado in 1970. The stadium's newly installed AstroTurf was unharmed, but some of the light towers on the east side—which had recently been fitted with extra lights for the color telecast of the All-America Game—were bent or snapped off. Even with the surrounding circumstances, the inaugural Jones Stadium game drew 42,150 in attendance, a record attendance that broke set in any prior Coaches All-America Game in Buffalo or Atlanta. The game finally found success by an attendance standard, drawing 285,786 attendees over 7 years. By the time of the final Coaches All-America Game in 1976, more players declined to participate in the all-star game as rookies and NFL owners had little to gain, and much to lose due to injury risks. The AFCA reluctantly dropped the Coaches All-America Game, but continued to bestow All-America honors.\n\nThe Texas Tech Red Raiders played their first game in Jones AT&T Stadium on November 29, 1947—a 14–6 win against the Hardin–Simmons Cowboys. The Red Raiders have a posted a 336-162-13 () record at Jones AT&T Stadium record through the 2013 victory over Iowa State. Dave Curtis, a writer for \"Sporting News\" listed the stadium as having the number one ranking amongst college stadiums in home field advantage. The attendance record of 61,836 was set during the 2013 season against the Oklahoma State Cowboys. The 2012 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team set a season average attendance record of 57,108, breaking the record set previously in 2010. A 34-27 win over the Oklahoma Sooners on November 17, 2007, was the start of a 12-game winning streak, the longest Red Raider winning streak at Jones AT&T Stadium that lasted through October 24, 2009, with a 52-30 loss to Texas A&M Aggies. Texas Tech has gone undefeated at Jones AT&T Stadium in 14 seasons, with the most recent coming in 2005 and 2008.\n\nA student attendance record of 16,092 was set on September 12, 2013 against Texas Christian University, breaking the record 14,915 set just one week earlier. The increased demand for student seating in 2013 led to Texas Tech allocating additional sections for the purpose, which contributed to the setting of a total yearly student attendance record in addition to the individual game records. Since 2009, Texas Tech has seen a 25 percent increase in the student attendance average, bucking a national trend of declining attendance. The student section has been named as the best such section in the Big 12 Conference by ESPN and \"The Norman Transcript\".\n\nAs of April 2014, there were 34,100 season tickets sold for the 2014 season, surpassing the previous season ticket record of 32,227 that were purchased prior to the start of the 2010 season. In July 2014, the athletic department announced that all season tickets had sold out for the first time in school history with a record 38,502 tickets sold.\n\nThe 10 highest overall attendance records for Texas Tech football games at Jones AT&T Stadium:\n\n"}

It was Peet's first novel and the first of three (as of 2012) football stories featuring South American sports journalist Paul Faustino. Cast as an interview with Faustino, the world's best goalkeeper, El Gato (\"The Cat\"), tells his life story. Peet won the Branford Boase Award, recognising the year's best debut novel for children.\n\nWalker's North American division Candlewick Press published the first US edition in 2005. Danish and Hungarian-language translations were also published that year and followed by German, Italian, and Spanish-language editions.\n\n\"Keeper\" was Peet's first novel, undertaken at age 52 and completed three years later.\n\nWhen he won the 2009 Guardian Prize for his third Paul Faustino football novel, \"Exposure\", he told the sponsoring newspaper he had felt that 'football books for children were \"pretty much hey\"'. Also, \"I used to play all the time. I would play football when it was light and read when it was dark. Now I get to play football vicariously.\"\n\nPeet described his creative occupation thus: \"I come up here in the morning to a pleasant room in the roof of my house and imagine I'm a black South American football superstar, then I have to imagine I'm a female pop celebrity who's pregnant. It's a completely mad way to spend your time. If I did it in public I would be sectioned. Writing is a form of licensed madness.\"\n\nPaul Faustino, a journalist for \"La Nación\", is interviewing El Gato about his recent World Cup win. During the interview, El Gato tells Faustino about his teenage years and his entry into soccer. When El Gato tells Faustino that he is coached by a ghost known to El Gato as \"the Keeper,\" Faustino thinks El Gato is lying to him. However, El Gato seems honest and looks like he is telling the truth.\n\nEl Gato continues to tell the interviewer his story. As a teenager, he secretly trains with the Keeper in an abandoned soccer field hidden in the rainforest. The young El Gato convinces his parents his time in the rainforest is the result of his fascination with nature. His family takes him for a naturalist, buying him collection materials and calling him \"Professor.\" The charade continues until El Gato turns 15, when he is expected to start working in the logging industry with his father. He does not tell the Keeper that he will no longer come to practice.\n\nHis first Saturday at work he finds out that his co-workers play a game of soccer after work. His co-workers invite him to play as the goalkeeper and, in his first game since his training with the Keeper, he helps his team win. The next Saturday, he plays with a new player who the others call \"El Ladron\", meaning \"the thief.\" In reality, El Ladron is a director for a soccer camp named DSJ. He also brings the owners of the team, Mr. and Mrs. DaSilva to the games. They want to sign El Gato for a two-year contract and give him 10,000 dollars. This begins his professional football career.\n\nFinally, El Gato reveals to Paul Faustino that he cheated in the second last penalty shot of the World Cup.\n\nEl Gato tells Faustino that he wants the interview to be a book. Faustino hesitates because he has to give this interview to his boss. However, he changes his mind and helps El Gato turn his interview into a book. El Gato eventually quits soccer and becomes a naturalist, just as his parents had always imagined. At the end of the novel, El Gato explains the Keeper's history as a real player.\n\nIn \"Keeper\" there are three main characters. The first character that will be written about is El Gato, the protagonist of the story. El Gato is actually just a nickname. He is a huge man who normally is very quiet. He is a world cup winning goal keeper, and throughout the story he is telling a soccer reporter his past in an interview. El Gato's mentor was a mysterious man referred to 'The Keeper' and nothing more. The Keeper's actual name is never mentioned at all in the book. The Keeper was somewhat of a phantom, and one doesn't learn much about him until the end of the story. The last character was a reporter, whose name is Paul Faustino. He wants to do the interview to receive a big bonus from his boss, because Paul is obsessed with money. NB: Actually the reporter, Paul Faustino, was the first character mentioned in the story. El Gato was the second, and the Keeper was the third.\n\nBeside winning the Branford Boase Award, \"Keeper\" was bronze runner up for the Smarties Prize in ages category 9–11 years and made the Hampshire Book Award shortlist.\n\nPeet, Mal. \"Keeper.\" Candlewick Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2005. \n\n"}

{"id": "7370499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7370499", "title": "Marty Ball", "text": "Marty Ball\n\nMarty Ball is a philosophy of football associated with and named after former NFL and UFL head coach Marty Schottenheimer. In simple terms, it means a focus on the running game, with passing used only to further the running game.\n\nSchottenheimer emphasizes offensive attacks that work as follows:\n\nFans (and critics) refer to this scheme as \"run, run, pass, punt\". Schottenheimer is considered to be a conservatively minded coach with the majority of his focus on defense. The term \"Marty Ball\" is generally considered a pejorative because, at times, Schottenheimer would steadfastly continue to emphasize this form of offensive attack while attempting to hold onto a small lead or when playing from behind—always without success.\n\nIn terms of regular season play in the NFL, Schottenheimer often ran Marty Ball successfully. During his coaching career with the Cleveland Browns, Kansas City Chiefs, Washington Redskins and San Diego Chargers, Schottenheimer compiled a 200-126-1 record. His teams won eight division titles, made 13 trips to the NFL playoffs, and reached the AFC Championship Game three times. He failed to successfully execute Marty Ball in the postseason, where he has a 6-13 record and never reached the Super Bowl. Schottenheimer is the only head coach in NFL history with at least 200 wins to have a losing playoff record.\n\nFellow NFL coach Herm Edwards said that it \"probably detracts [from his legacy] in the minds of some people, but I know it doesn’t in the minds of people who have coached against him.\"\n\nDespite never reaching the Super Bowl in the NFL, Schottenheimer has won a pro football title of sorts as a head coach. In 2011, he guided the United Football League’s Virginia Destroyers to the league championship, defeating the Las Vegas Locomotives in the title game. Schottenheimer’s Destroyers were powered offensively by running back Dominic Rhodes, who was also the UFL Offensive Player of the Year in 2011.\n\nAlthough Schottenheimer's assistants have gone on to successful head coaching careers--Bill Cowher, Tony Dungy, and Herm Edwards have also employed similar strategies of running the football and having a strong defense (also known as \"smash mouth football\") -- none have adopted the Marty Ball approach. Edwards in particular is likely the closest to using the Marty Ball strategy than any other Schottenheimer protégé.\n\nTony Dungy, in particular, employed a run-first offense during his tenure as coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1996-2001. He abandoned his conservative philosophy during his coaching tenure with the Indianapolis Colts from 2002–2008, however. Dungy's Colts teams normally passed the ball more on offense due to Peyton Manning's presence on the team. In addition, Bill Cowher had been known to take more risks (such as attempting fourth down conversions) than his mentor during his tenure with the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1992-2006, and himself had successful passing offenses with Neil O'Donnell, Ben Roethlisberger, and to a lesser extent Tommy Maddox without abandoning the running game. Unlike Schottenheimer, both Cowher and Dungy have each won a Super Bowl. In 2016, Dungy earned induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame for his work as a head coach. Mike McCarthy, who is also one of Schottenheimer's former assistants, employs a pass-oriented offense as well, as the current head coach of the Green Bay Packers. With the help of quarterback Aaron Rodgers, McCarthy was able to guide the Packers to a Super Bowl win in 2010.\n\n"}

It is located next to Zeppelinfeld. It also neighbors the Nuremberg Arena.\n\nSince 1966, it has been home stadium to the German Bundesliga club 1. FC Nürnberg. During the 1972 Summer Olympics, it hosted six football matches. In 1967, it hosted the European Cup Winners' Cup final between Rangers and Bayern Munich. Bayern won 1–0.\n\nThe stadium hosted five games of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, including the famous match between Portugal and the Netherlands, consequently known as the Battle of Nuremberg.\n\nOriginally it was known as the Städtisches Stadion () until 1945, when it was renamed Victory Stadium. In 1961, it returned to its original name until 1991, when it received the name Frankenstadion .\n\nOn 14 March 2006, the stadium was renamed easyCredit-Stadion for a period of five years, after a sponsorship deal with the German bank DZ Bank. Many fans of the 1. FC Nuremberg, led by the \"Ultras Nuremberg\" introduced on 1 April 2006, held demonstration against the name and symbolically renamed the stadium with its current name, in honour of one of the best players in the club's history, Max Morlock. On 14 February 2013, the stadium was renamed Grundig Stadion ( or ), after a sponsorship deal with Grundig.\n\nIn July 2016, the stadium's name changed back to Stadion Nürnberg after the city of Nuremberg could not find a new sponsor. From 1 July 2017, the stadium's name officially became Max-Morlock-Stadion.\n\nThe available facilities at the stadium include two changing rooms for players, changing rooms for coaches, referees. Also physician and treatment rooms are available. A 300 m² press area, an area for press conferences, and three TV studios make the stadium a truly modern one. 1200 m² makes up the VIP area with room for 800 guests. To compensate for the large number of seats there are 15,000 parking spaces with 205 for VIPs.\n\nThe stadium also has track and field facilities that follow international regulation. A full sprinkler system, that feeds the grass with rain water. The pitch is also heated, and lit with a floodlight system. There are two 60 m² video walls that provide video to the fans. There is also a full power back up system, powered by diesel generators.\n\nBeginning in 1933, the National Socialists began to use the stadium as a marching area for the Hitler Youth. The fourth \"Deutsche Kampfspiele\", one of the biggest events organized by the Nazi Sports Body, took place in this stadium from 23–29 July 1934.\n\nFollowing 1963, the stadium was reconditioned multiple times, so that it could meet the requirements for football in the Bundesliga.\n\nMax-Morlock-Stadion has been renovated two times, once in 1988 to 1991, and then again renovation began again in 2002, to be ready in time for the 2006 World Cup. The 2002 renovation cost €56.2 million; the cost is split between the city of Nürnberg, the State of Bavaria and the building society, which managed the stadium. The stadium has had its capacity increased to 48,548. this modernisation was designed and realized by HPP Architects. This was achieved by extending the southwest and northwest grandstand. The playing field was lowered by 1.30 metres in order to provide all seats an unrestricted view of the field. The Max Morlock place was developed as a place for fans to meet and enjoy something to eat; the total area of this place is 1,000 metres. In the summer of 2012, the capacity was increased to 50,000.\n\nThe Monsters of Rock Festival 1984, originally planned on the Zeppelinfield, took place in the Städtisches Stadion.\n\nP!nk performed at the stadium on July 15, 2010 during The Funhouse Summer Carnival.\n\nThe stadium and the adjacent Nuremberg Arena are well serviced by public transportation to facilitate transport of fans from and to the various sports and musical events taking place there:\n\n\nDuring mass sports and entertainment events, such as Bundesliga games or the annual Rock im Park festival, additional S-Bahn trains running between main station and Frankenstadion station are being put into service. Before the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Frankenstadion station had the length of its existing platform doubled and an additional platform built for that purpose.\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the World Cup of 2006:\n\n"}

It is used mostly for football matches and has a capacity 12,500. The Naadam festival, which celebrates Mongolian independence, is held there every July. The land owned by the stadium company is about 27 hectares, of which the stadium takes about 8 hectares of land. The National Sport Stadium in Mongolia hosted the 2016 World University Archery Championship.\n\nThe stadium was established in 1958 by Russian construction in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Since then, it has not been majorly renovated, although it gets a little painting and touch up once a year. Even though the stadium was built for multi-use such as football and festivals, the only mandatory event is the Naadam festival held on July 11 of each year which commemorates the independence day of 1921. Other events are usually held under a contract except those organized by the government.\n\nThe stadium is part private owned and part government owned, with a 51%/49% split. The reason for its split ownership is that there is only one stadium that can hold 12,500 people in Mongolia. If the stadium was wholly private the government would have to fund the entire Naadam festive, 70% of the costs of which are taken from ticket sales and the leasing of surrounding land.\n\n"}

{"id": "1694145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1694145", "title": "Night game", "text": "Night game\n\nA night game, also called a nighter, is a sporting event that takes place, completely or partially, after the local sunset. Depending on the sport, this can be done either with floodlights or with the usual low-light conditions. The term \"night game\" is typically used only in reference to sports traditionally held outdoors. Although indoor sporting events often take place after local sunset, these events are artificially lighted regardless of the time of day they take place.\n\nA baseball game was played under electric lighting in 1880, the year after Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. It was an experimental game between two department store teams, and it would take another fifty years before organized baseball would sanction night baseball. There were a couple of exhibition night baseball games in the early 1900s between organized baseball teams. One of them was in 1909, and the other was in 1927, but the games did not count in league standings. Even though the games were between professional teams, they were unofficial experiments and did not count as the \"nocturnal first\". In 1929, the president of the Des Moines, Iowa baseball club announced to the National Association convention he was going to play night baseball in 1930. However, the first official minor league night game actually took place in Independence, Kansas on April 28, 1930.\n\nAn article in the April 1931 edition of Baseball Magazine stated that Independence was the first team in America to play a league night baseball game. After the game in Independence, night baseball \"spread like wildfire\" across the minor leagues. In addition to that, in 1935, The Sporting News pointed out that Des Moines, Iowa was not the first to install permanent lights, but it was in fact Independence that did so. By the end of the 1934 season there were sixty-five minor league teams with permanent lights installed on their fields. The light towers installed in Independence in 1930 were removed and scrapped in June 1990. Mickey Mantle, an Independence Yankee in 1949, played under the historic lights.\n\nLighting technology had significantly improved since the 1927 night game exhibition. After fifty years of experiments, a new era in professional baseball was about to start. The Independence Producers of Independence, Kansas were a Class C minor league baseball team that played in a stadium known now as Shulthis Stadium. They purchased lights from the Giant Manufacturing Company and installed permanent lights on their field. When Independence played the night game on April 28, 1930, it made Independence the birthplace of professional night baseball. By the end of the 1930 season there were thirty-eight minor league teams with lights installed on their fields.\n\nIndependence played the first night game in the history of Organized Baseball on April 28, 1930. The term Organized Baseball refers to Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball games. Organized Baseball games must follow specific rules in order to be Organized Baseball games. The Commissioner of Baseball has authority over Organized Baseball. Independence lost the league game to the Muskogee Chiefs by a score of 13-3. Independence had previously played an exhibition game against the House of David, a professional baseball team, but the game did not qualify as an Organized Baseball game. Independence did however defeat the House of David with a score of 9-1.\n\nSince Independence had played a night baseball game before any Major League teams did so, the first night game in the history of Organized Baseball took place in Independence, Kansas. Numerous references, photos, and media clippings discussing the first night Organized Baseball game are available can be found on websites.\n\nAfter the 1930 game in Independence, night baseball did spread to other countries. The first night game baseball game in Canada took place in Vancouver, Canada in 1931. In 1933 Japan played their first night baseball game, and Cuba did so in 1937.\n\nThe first big-league team to play games at night was the 1930 Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues, who often played against the House of David baseball team, who carried portable lights mounted on trucks along with their team bus.\n\nThe last non-expansion/non-relocated team to play all their home games in the daytime were the Chicago Cubs; they played their first official night game in Wrigley Field on August 9, 1988 and beat the New York Mets 6–4, one night after their initial attempt at night baseball (against the Philadelphia Phillies) was rained out before it became official. The Cubs still play the fewest home night games of any major league club (35 per season, as of 2014).\n\nThe first night All-Star Game was held at Philadelphia's Shibe Park in 1943, while the first World Series night game was Game 4 of the 1971 Series at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. All All-Star Games since 1969, and all World Series games since Game 6 of the 1987 Series, have been played at night.\n\nThe use of floodlights in cricket matches has helped to bring much investment into the game both at a national and an international level since it began in 1977. Today floodlit (day/night) cricket is played in most of the test playing nations although some nations have only started hosting day/night matches in the last 10 to 12 years. Many important tournaments like Indian Premier League and Champions League Twenty20 have become success due to night games.\n\nCricket was first played under floodlights on Monday, August 11, 1952 in England which was watched by several million people on their television sets. Since then every test playing country has installed floodlights in their stadiums. Traditional Cricket floodlights have a long pole on which lights are fixed. This is done because many times the ball travels too high when a batsman hits it and high lights are needed to keep the ball in sight. But many cricket stadiums have different types of floodlights like ANZ Stadium in Australia, stadiums in New Zealand etc. The DSC Cricket Stadium in Dubai recently installed Ring of Fire system of floodlights which is latest and smartest system of floodlight in the world.\n\nThe term has also been adopted by other outdoor stadium sports such as American football and Canadian football. The first night football game was played in Mansfield, Pennsylvania on September 28, 1892 between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary. It ended bitterly at halftime in a 0–0 tie.\nIn 1893 at the Chicago's World Fair, the Chicago A. A. played a night football game against West Point. Chicago won the 40-minute game 14–0. On November 21, 1902, the Philadelphia Athletics of the first National Football League defeated the Kanaweola Athletic Club, 39–0, at Maple Avenue Driving Park in the first professional football night game. The first night football game west of the Mississippi River was played in Wichita, Kansas in 1905 between Cooper College (now Sterling College of Sterling, Kansas) and Fairmount College (now Wichita State University).\n\nThe first NFL game played at night was in 1929 when the Chicago Cardinals played the Providence Steam Roller.\n\nAutomobile races at night can take on two different forms. Sports car races such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans and rally races such as Monte Carlo Rally manage to continue running through the night by having the competing cars utilize headlights.\n\nThe alternate possibility involves installing a system of flood lights along the circuit to illuminate it for cars that do not have headlights. The lights must be designed to diffuse light over a large space to reduce glare on both windshields and a driver's visor. Systems such as this have been common in short track motor racing for many years. The night NASCAR race at Bristol Motor Speedway's half-mile track in Tennessee is among the most popular events of the season. The first modern oval track over 1 mile (1.609 kilometers) long to install a lighting system was Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1992. NASCAR sanctioned races have been held at night for many years due to systems like these. MotoGP held its first night race at Losail International Circuit in 2008. Formula One held its first night race at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix.\n\n"}

{"id": "5184702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5184702", "title": "Tent pegging", "text": "Tent pegging\n\nTent pegging (sometimes spelled tent-pegging or tentpegging) is a cavalry sport of ancient origin, and is one of only ten equestrian disciplines officially recognised by the International Equestrian Federation. Used narrowly, the term refers to a specific mounted game with ground targets. More broadly, it refers to the entire class of mounted cavalry games involving edged weapons on horseback, for which the term \"equestrian skill-at-arms\" is also used.\n\nCavaliers have practised the specific game of tent pegging since at least the 4th century BC, and Asian and later European empires spread the game around the world. As a result, the game's date and location of origin are ambiguous.\n\nIn all accounts, the competitive sport evolved out of cavalry training exercises designed to develop cavaliers' prowess with the sword and lance from horseback. However, whether tent pegging developed cavaliers' generic skills or prepared them for specific combat situations is unclear.\n\nAccording to the International Equestrian Federation, \"most equestrian authorities are of the opinion that tent-pegging originated in India in the middle ages in the battle fields as a tactics used by the horsed cavalry against elephant mounted troops\" A cavalier able to precisely stab the highly sensitive flesh behind an elephant's toenail would cause the enemy elephant to rear, unseat his mahout, and possibly run amok, breaking ranks and trampling infantry. However, other scholarly sources suggest that the sport originated earlier in Central Asia or the Middle East and was later on popularised in India.\n\nThe term \"tent pegging\" is certainly related to the idea that cavaliers mounting a surprise pre-dawn raid on an enemy camp could use the game's skills to sever or uproot tent pegs, thus collapsing the tents on their sleeping occupants and sowing havoc and terror in the camp. However, there are few reliable accounts of a cavalry squadron ever employing such tactics.\n\nBecause the specific game of tent pegging is the most popular equestrian skill-at-arms game, the entire class of sports became known as tent pegging during the twilight of cavalry in the twentieth century. In the Pakistani region of Balochistan it is the provincial sport.\n\nThe specific game of tent pegging has a mounted horseman riding at a gallop and using a sword or a lance to pierce, pick up, and carry away a small ground target (a symbolic tent peg) or a series of small ground targets.\n\nThe broader class of tent pegging games also includes ring jousting (in which a galloping rider tries to pass the point of his weapon through a suspended ring); lemon sticking (in which the rider tries to stab or slice a lemon suspended from a cord or sitting on a platform); quintain tilting (in which the rider charges a mannequin mounted on a swivelling or rocking pedestal); and Parthian (i.e., mounted) archery.\n\nA given tent pegging competition's rules specify the size and composition of the target; the number of consecutive targets placed on a course; the dimensions and weight of the sword, lance, or bow; the minimum time in which a course must be covered; and the extent to which a target must be struck, cut, or carried.\n\nToday, tent pegging is practised around the world, but is especially popular in Australia, India, Israel, Oman, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. The Olympic Council of Asia included tent pegging as an official sport in 1982, and the International Federation for Equestrian Sports recognised it as an official equestrian discipline in 2004.\n\nFrom the results of the 2008 International Tent Pegging Championships, the world's three leading national teams are currently Canada, India, and Oman. Members of cavalry regiments and mounted police forces remain dominant in world-class tent pegging.\n\nThe United States Tent Pegging Federation is working on introducing tent pegging on the sidelines of polo in the United States. In late 1990s, many efforts were made mostly solo efforts by individuals like H.E Prince Malik Ata Khan and Maharaja of Dunlod, H.E Raghuvendra Pratap Singh to promote tent pegging in USA. EFI tent pegging pioneers provided much encouragement to export tent pegging to the USA. Also H.E Prince Malik Ata Khan, the icon of modern-day tent pegging supported the idea of formation of a Tent Pegging as an organized sport in the USA. All of their thrust was to establish an organization in the United States so that USA could represent itself on the international front. At present the USTPF, working hard to promote Tent Pegging in the USA. The promotion efforts include two Tent Pegging Training Clinics initiated in October 2014 and June 2015 to compete in the international Arena. The USTPF was recognized by the USEF as Alliance Partner in 2015 and an NGB for Tent Pegging in the USA. The USEF granted the Alliance Partnership to the USTPF with permanent Alliance Partnership number 5347848.\n\nNew and emerging national tent pegging associations have helped spread the sport's popularity. The Australian Royal Adelaide Show, the British Tent Pegging Association, and the United States Cavalry Association now hold annual national championships and demonstrations in their respective countries.\n\nIn Pakistan tent pegging is known as Neza Bazi as well. It is played in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and some parts of Sindh and Balochistan, it is the unofficial provincial sport of Balochistan, Pakistan. There are many clubs who have owned different and unique style of Turban and Waistcoat to identify their clubs. People decorate their horses for the competition.

Clubs from all the districts of Pakistan participates there.\n\nThe pre-eminent tent pegging games remain centred in Asia and the Middle East, with the International Tent Pegging Championships and the continental Asian Games traditionally enjoying the highest number of competitors and participating states.\n\nThe recognised international governing body of Tent Pegging is International Tent Pegging Federation. The ITPF headquarters are located in Muscat, Oman. It was founded as World Tent Pegging Federation in 2013 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, Pakistan, India and others renamed the World \nTent Pegging Federation in 2014, and took up its current name in the same year. Essentially ITPF is very new and does and does not have full world recognition and not all countries which play tent pegging are its members. Also ITPF is the largest equestrian body in the world that recognizes and governs tent pegging competitions.\n\nTent pegging being primarily a foreign game from the Middle East and Indian Subcontinent, and was faded from the equestrian sports map of the USA. However, Tent Pegging was well known prior to the World War II in the continental USA. As a need of present times, with tent pegging being played in many countries around the world, USTPF came into existence as a National Governing Body for Tent Pegging and to promote tent pegging domestically and represent USA internationally. USTPF was formed in 2013 in USA.
