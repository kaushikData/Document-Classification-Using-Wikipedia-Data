{"id": "6155965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6155965", "title": "Cork Senior Hurling Championship", "text": "Cork Senior Hurling Championship\n\nThe Cork Senior Hurling Championship (known for sponsorship reasons as the \"Evening Echo\" Cork County Senior Hurling Championship) is an annual hurling competition organised by the Cork County Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association since 1887 for the top hurling teams in the county of Cork in Ireland.\n\nThe series of games are played during the summer and autumn months with the county final currently being played at Páirc Uí Chaoimh in October. The prize for the winning team is the Seán Óg Murphy Cup. Initially played as a knock-out competition, the championship currently uses a double elimination format whereby each team is guaranteed at least two games.\n\nThe Cork County Championship is an integral part of the wider Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship. The winners of the Cork county final join the champions of the other four hurling counties to contest the provincial championship.\n\nTwenty-six teams currently participate in the Cork County Championship. The title has been won at least once by nineteen different teams. The all-time record-holders are Blackrock, who have led the roll of honour since the championship began and have won a total of 32 titles.\n\nImokilly are the title-holders after defeating Midleton by 4-19 to 1-18 in the 2018 championship final.\n\nFollowing the foundation of the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1884, new rules for Gaelic football and hurling were drawn up and published in the \"United Irishman\" newspaper. In 1886, county committees were established, with the Cork County Board affiliating on 19 December 1886. The inaugural championship was played during the summer of 1887, however, the final stages ended in disarray with no final being played. In spite of this, Cork Nationals were subsequently declared the champions. Since then the championship title has been awarded every year except on two occasions. A delay in the 1904 championship meant that the 1905 championship never took place. Civil unrest following the burning of Cork at the height of the War of Independence resulted in the 1921 championship being cancelled.\n\nSince the beginning the championship has been dominated by Blackrock, St. Finbarr's and Glen Rovers who are collectively known as the \"big three\". They have won a combined total of 84 championship titles. Blackrock dominated the first thirty years of the championship, winning 15 titles between 1887 and 1920. It was during this time that the county championship earned the nickname of the \"little All-Ireland\" due to its competitive nature. St. Finbarr's, after making a breakthrough in the early years of the 20th century, were the team of the decade for the 1920s before regularly claiming championship titles in each of the decades that followed. Glen Rovers made their own breakthrough with a first championship in 1934 and were the dominant club from then until the 1960s. Between 1971 and 1982, the \"big three\" shared every available championship title. Their rivalry reached its peak in 1977 when a record attendance of 34,151 saw St. Finbarr's defeat Glen Rovers in the championship decider.\n\nSince that zenith the \"big three\" have only claimed two titles in each of the decades from 1990 to 2017 as the power base of Cork hurling has moved from the city to the county with several clubs making significant breakthroughs and impacts on the championship. In 1983 Midleton broke the decade-long hegemony and went on to claim five championships over a thirty-year period to 2013. In 1990 Na Piarsaigh became the first city club outside of the \"big three\" since Redmonds in 1917 to claim the championship. They added two more titles in 1995 and 2004. Erin's Own also added their name to the roll of honour in 1992 before winning further titles in 2006 and 2007. The mid nineties saw the rise of the divisional sides, with Carbery, Avondhu and Imokilly claiming four championship titles between 1994 and 1998. The success of Newtownshandrum between 2000 and 2009 also highlighted the changing demographics of Cork hurling as the tiny parish of 800 people won four championships during that decade. Sarsfields, although close in proximity to the city but based in the East Cork division, ended a 51-year famine in 2008 by claiming their third championship title ever. Between 2008 and 2015 they appeared in seven finals and won four titles. The East Cork village of Carrigtwohill ended a 93-wait for their second championship title in 2011.\n\nIn recent decades many rural and city-based clubs have also contested championship deciders without making a successful breakthrough. These include Ballyhea, Cloyne, Bride Rovers and Bishopstown. Educational institutions like University College Cork and Cork Institute of Technology have also appeared in finals.\n\n22 teams entered the inaugural championship in 1887 and a single elimination format was used. Each team was afforded only one defeat before being eliminated from the championship. The creation of the divisions in the 1920s added a new dimension to the championship. These divisional teams, which were composed of junior and intermediate players, competed in a preliminary section with the two winning teams advancing to the championship proper which retained its single elimination format. The introduction of a \"back door\" system at inter-county level in the All-Ireland Championship in 1997 lead to the idea of introducing a second chance for defeated teams at county level. In the twenty-year period from the late 1990s to 2017, the championship underwent a number of format changes. The provision of a second chance for defeated teams was later expanded to allow teams the opportunity of being defeated twice and still remain in the championship. The splitting of the intermediate grade in two resulted in the introduction of relegation in 2006, with Delaney Rovers becoming the first team to be relegated that year. Prior to this teams were allowed to decide for themselves if they wanted to regrade or retain their senior status. In 2015 the championship once again reverted to a double elimination format.\n\nThe Cork County Championship is a double elimination tournament. Each team is afforded two defeats before being eliminated from the championship. Pairings for matches are drawn at random and there is no seeding.\n\nEach match is played as a single leg. If a match is drawn there is a period of extra time, however, if both sides are still level at the end of extra time a replay takes place and so on until a winner is found.\n\nRound 1: Eight teams contest this round. The four winning teams advance to Round 2. The four losing teams are eliminated from the championship.\n\nRound 2: Four teams contest this round. The two winning teams advance to Round 3 of the championship proper. The two losing teams are eliminated from the championship.\n\nRound 1: 18 teams contest this round. The nine losing teams advance to Round 2. The nine winning teams advance to Round 3.\n\nRound 2: The 9 losing teams from Round 1 contest this round. The four winning teams advance to Round 3. The four losing teams are eliminated from the championship. One team will receive a bye to Round 3.\n\nRound 3: The 9 winning teams from Round 1, the 4 winning teams from Round 2, the bye team and the 2 divisional teams contest this round. The 8 winning teams advance to the Quarter-finals. The 8 losing teams are eliminated from the championship.\nQuarter-finals: 8 teams contest this round. The 4 winning teams advance to the Semi-finals. The 4 losing teams are eliminated from the championship.\n\nSemi-finals: 4 teams contest this round. The 2 winning teams advance to the Semi-finals. The 2 losing teams are eliminated from the championship.\n\nFinal: The final is contested by the two semi-final winners.\n\nSince 2005 the Cork County Championship has been sponsored by the \"Evening Echo\". The competition was previously sponsored by TSB Bank.\n\nThe Cork Senior Hurling Championship winners qualify for the subsequent Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship. This place is reserved for club teams only as divisional and amalgamated teams are not allowed in the provincial championship. If a divisional side wins the Cork Championship then the runners-up qualify for the Munster Championship. This has occurred on five occasions. If two divisional sides qualify for the final then the provincial championship place is given to one of the defeated semi-finalists. This occurred in 1996 when Na Piarsaigh represented Cork due to Avondhu and Imokilly contesting the final.\n\nFixtures in the opening rounds of the championship are usually played at a neutral venue that is deemed halfway between the participating teams. Some of the more common venues include Mallow GAA Complex, Brinny Sportsfield, Coachford Pitch and Clonmult Memorial Park. All games from Round 4 onward are played at either Páirc Uí Rinn or Páirc Uí Chaoimh.\n\nThe final has been played at the rebuilt Páirc Uí Chaoimh since it opened in 2017. The rebuilding process meant that the finals of 2015 and 2016 were hosted at Páirc Uí Rinn. Prior to rebuilding, the final was hosted by the original Páirc Uí Chaoimh since it opened in 1976. The final was played at the Mardyke in 1974 and 1975, while in the 70 years prior to the development of Páirc Uí Chaoimh the final was usually played at the Cork Athletic Grounds. From the inaugural championship in 1887 up to the turn of the 20th century, the final was held at Cork Park.\n\nManagers in the Cork Championship are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and sourcing of players. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the individual club committees. The manager is assisted by a team of two or three selectors and a backroom team consisting of various coaches.\n\nThe winning team is presented with the Seán Óg Murphy Cup. A native of Cork city, Seán Óg Murphy (1897–1956) played hurling for Blackrock and Gaelic football for Nils. He won three All-Ireland medals with Cork and served as secretary of the Cork County Board from 1929 until his death in 1956. The cup is similar in design to the Liam MacCarthy Cup.\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\nThe most successful team of each decade, judged by number of Cork Senior Hurling Championship titles, is as follows:\n\n\nOnly 7 teams of the 19 who have won the championship have ever successfully defended the title. These are:\n\nTop ten longest gaps between successive championship titles:\n\nThree teams have won the Cork Senior Hurling Championship and the Cork Senior Football Championship in a single year as part of a hurling-Gaelic football double. Glen Rovers and their sister club, St. Nicholas', became the first teams to win the double in 1938 before claiming two further doubles in 1941 and 1954. University College Cork won their only double in 1963. St. Finbarr's hold the distinction of being the only single entity club team to have won the double. They achieved this in 1980 and 1982.\n\nDivisional sides Avondhu, Carbery and Imokilly and club team Midleton also hold the distinction of being dual county senior championship-winning teams, however, these were not achieved in a single calendar season.\n\n\nC103 & CRY 104.0FM provides extensive radio coverage of the championship, including several full live commentaries from Round 1 to the final.

{"id": "42383059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42383059", "title": "Dual-threat quarterback", "text": "Dual-threat quarterback\n\nIn gridiron football, a dual-threat quarterback, also known as a running quarterback, is a quarterback who possesses the skills and physique to run with the ball if necessary. With the rise of several blitz heavy defensive schemes and increasingly faster defensive players, the importance of a mobile quarterback has been redefined. While arm power, accuracy, and pocket presence – the ability to successfully operate from within the \"pocket\" formed by his blockers – are still the most important quarterback virtues, the ability to elude or run past defenders creates an additional threat that allows greater flexibility in the team's passing and running game. Overall, the dual-threat quarterback has been referred to as \"the most complex position in sports\" by Bleacher Report.\n\nDual-threat quarterbacks have historically been more prolific at the college level. Typically, a quarterback with exceptional quickness is used in an option offense, which allows the quarterback to either hand the ball off, run it himself, or pitch it to the running back following him at a distance of three yards outside and one yard behind. This type of offense forces defenders to commit to either the running back up the middle, the quarterback around the end, or the running back trailing the quarterback. It is then that the quarterback has the \"option\" to identify which match up is most favorable to the offense as the play unfolds and exploit that defensive weakness. In the college game, many schools employ several plays that are designed for the quarterback to run with the ball.\n\nThis is much less common in professional football, except for a quarterback sneak, but there is still an emphasis on being mobile enough to escape a heavy pass rush. Historically, dual threat quarterbacks in the National Football League (NFL) were uncommon, with Michael Vick being considered a rarity in the early 2000s. In recent years, quarterbacks with dual-threat capabilities have become more popular. Current NFL starting quarterbacks considered to be dual threats include Cam Newton, Russell Wilson, Marcus Mariota, Deshaun Watson, Mitchell Trubisky, Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, and, to a lesser extent, Aaron Rodgers, Andrew Luck, Dak Prescott, Patrick Mahomes, and Carson Wentz. \n\nIn the 1950s, Tobin Rote, was a rare example of a dual-threat quarterback, as he led the Green Bay Packers in rushing in 3 seasons, and retired with 3,128 yards. As of the end of 2017 NFL season, Rote still ranks 10th all time in rushing yards for a quarterback.\n\nThe next decade, however, saw Fran Tarkenton impact the game in both passing and running aspects. Tarkenton writes, \"When I began my NFL career in 1961, I was a freak. The reason was simple: I played quarterback and I ran. There were no designed runs in our playbook, but I would scramble out of the pocket when a play broke down.\" Tarkenton adds by describing the reaction to his scrambling at the time, \"It was not a skill set that was embraced. Plenty of people mocked it, and the rest wrote it off.\" At the time of his retirement, Tarkenton was the all-time leader in rushing yards by a quarterback, with 3,674.\n\nIn 1972, Chicago Bears quarterback Bobby Douglass set the single-season rushing yards record for a quarterback, as he logged 968 yards. Douglass, however, was not considered a good passer, as his receivers complained his arm strength was, \"too strong,\" as he often overthrew the ball. The Bears attempted to create wild schemes, before discovering his rushing ability, leading to his record-breaking 1972 season.\n\nAnother rare dual-threat quarterback that emerged in the 1970s was Steve Grogan. While playing college football for Kansas State, Grogan had rushed for a 100-yard game, and had over 500 yards in two seasons as a starter. Drafted by the New England Patriots in 1975, Grogan scored 12 rushing touchdowns in the 1976 season, a record for quarterbacks which stood for 35 years. During the 1978 season, Grogan ran for 539 yards, on a team which set the NFL record for total rushing yards (3,165), which still stands as of 2018. Limited by injuries during the middle part of his career, Grogan would transition to a more traditional pocket-passer by the middle 1980s.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 90s, dual-threat quarterbacks were more frequently seen than in previous decades. Randall Cunningham and Steve Young were the faces of rushing quarterbacks during this era. Cunningham was able to exceed Young in statistical regards. On October 18, 1992, Cunningham surpassed Tarkenton's record for career rushing yards by a quarterback. Following the 2001 NFL season, Cunningham retired with a then-record 4,928 rushing yards. Despite Cunningham having more rushing yards, Young held the record for most career rushing touchdowns by a quarterback (43) until being surpassed by Cam Newton in 2016.\n\nThere is debate as to whether Young or Cunningham was the better rushing quarterback. \"CraveOnline\" writes that, although, \"there may be two others [Vick and Cunningham] that hold an edge to Steve Young in amount of yards rushed, career wise, by a QB but make no mistake about it, if you are a QB that can run, then Young is who you want to emulate,\" adding that, Young, \"had the rare gift of explosive speed combined with deadly accuracy.\" As for Cunningham, Jeff Darlington, an NFL Media reporter, writes, \"True, Steve Young had legs that merited the respect of defenders. But Cunningham ... Cunningham was different. And today's quarterbacks know it.\" Darlington adds to his point by referring to an anecdote from Robert Griffin III, a 2010s rushing quarterback, in which Griffin III would watch Cunningham's highlights with his father. Griffin III elaborates, \"We'd watch how well he moved in the pocket to avoid defenders and make plays -- not just with his legs, but with his arm. He was one of the first true game-changers the league saw.\"\n\nAside from Cunningham and Young, Steve McNair and Kordell Stewart were also considered dynamic running quarterbacks.\nAs Young, Cunningham, and John Elway, another dual-threat QB from the 1980s and 90s, all retired from 1998 to 2001, a new generation of mobile quarterbacks was ushered in. Donovan McNabb was drafted by the Eagles in 1999, beginning a successful quarterbacking career, in which his running ability was frequently identified. On his mobility, McNabb once joked, \"I think you run a lot better when you don't want to be hit.\" After sustaining an injury in the 2003 season, there was speculation as to if McNabb would be able to retain his mobility, as Ray Buchanan stated, \"We'd probably rather see McNabb, because he's not as mobile right now,\" which McNabb responded with, \"According to everyone else I'm not mobile. I'll just let people continue to think that, and when the time comes, I'll make sure I showcase that a little bit.\"\n\nMcNabb was also connected to Michael Vick, one of the most prolific running quarterbacks in the history of the NFL. While attending Syracuse University, McNabb attempted to assist in the recruitment of Michael Vick, and in addition to that, McNabb also mentored Vick about the speed of the professional level. Vick also served as McNabb's backup in Philadelphia in 2009, later succeeding McNabb as the starter for the franchise. Michael Vick was drafted first overall by Atlanta Falcons in 2001. Vick would go on to be a successful runner for the Falcons from 2001 to 2006. 14 games into his 2006 season, Vick broke Douglass' single-season rushing yards record by a quarterback. A week later, Vick surpassed the 1,000 rushing yards milestone, becoming the first quarterback to reach the mark in a single season. He finished the season with a record 1,039 yards. Vick's mobility influenced future mobile quarterbacks; Jenny Vrentas of \"Sports Illustrated\" writes, \"Young players go out of their way to tell Vick that they were always him when they played \"Madden\" growing up, and wore his Nike cleats.\"\n\nAfter his return to the NFL, and a season as McNabb's backup, Vick earned his second starting opportunity. His 2010 rushing statistics (league-leading 676 yards among quarterbacks and 9 touchdowns) were the foundation for the landscape of mobile quarterbacks during the early 2010s. The following season, on October 9, Vick surpassed Cunningham's career rushing yardage total, to claim the career-record for quarterbacks. That season also saw Cam Newton drafted first overall by the Carolina Panthers. Newton went on to lead quarterbacks in rushing yards with 706, and earned 14 rushing touchdowns, breaking Steve Grogan's 1976 single-season record by a quarterback. In addition to Newton, notable dual-threat quarterbacks in the early 2010s included Aaron Rodgers, Robert Griffin III, Tim Tebow, Colin Kaepernick, Russell Wilson, and Andrew Luck. On his overall impact and legacy in regards to dual-threat quarterbacks, Vick stated, \"I was the guy who started it all,\" adding, \"I revolutionized the game. I changed the way it was played in the NFL.\"\nIn the 2014 season, Kaepernick, Griffin III, and Newton were all cited as declining or regressing players. Kaepernick was labeled, \"symbolic of running QB struggles,\" by NFL.com writer, Chris Wesseling. This status came after Kaepernick and the 49ers were defeated by Derek Carr and the Oakland Raiders. Carr is not considered a dual-threat quarterback, though his, \"mindset, athleticism, pocket presence, quick release and strong arm\" have all been praised by executives, coaches and analysts. Steve Young, who ranks third all-time in rushing yards for a quarterback, was cited as believing scrambling away from pressure limits and stunts the development of a quarterback's pocket presence. During the season, Bill Polian, a former Indianapolis Colts president, stated, \"What we're seeing this year is the incredible erosion of the running quarterback.\" Obstacles such as high expectations and an increased potential for injury hindered the perception that mobile quarterbacks would become the dominant breed of the position.\n\nWhile Kaepernick, Newton, and Griffin III struggled during the season, mobility in other quarterbacks was praised. Success in the passing game, while having mobility to extend the play, was regarded more highly than pure running athleticism in 2014. Aaron Rodgers' mobility, for example, was considered by one NFL.com writer to be critical to the Packers' offense. New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick praised Rodgers' mobility, stating, \"he has a great ability to extend plays, either sliding in the pocket or at times scrambling outside the pocket.\" Luck's mobility was also acclaimed by another NFL head coach, Chip Kelly. Despite early-season reports of a decline in the performance of dual-threat quarterbacks, Russell Wilson rushed for a career-high 849 yards and 6 touchdowns in 2014, leading the Seattle Seahawks to a second consecutive Super Bowl appearance.\n\nNew dual-threat quarterbacks emerged as starters during 2015 such as Marcus Mariota and Tyrod Taylor. Also in 2015, Cam Newton had a resurgent season, scoring 10 rushing touchdowns en route to a Super Bowl berth. However, as Newton was also successful in his passing game, one \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter wrote \"defenses say it is Newton's ability to do anything on any given play that really keeps them up at night\", adding \"[Newton] is a pass-first quarterback capable of picking up a first down with his legs at any moment.\"\n\n\"Note: stats are accurate as of the end of the 2017 NFL season.\"\n\n\"Note: The list only includes seasons in which a quarterback rushed for double-digit touchdowns\"\nThe width of the CFL's field at 65 yards and the length at 110 yards has allowed quarterbacks to find openings to run the ball, implementing improvisation by a quarterback as a beneficial trait in Canadian football. Quarterback sneaks or other runs in short yardage situations tend to be successful as a result of the distance between the offensive and defensive lines being one yard. Drew Tate, a quarterback for the Calgary Stampeders', led the CFL in rushing touchdowns during the 2014 season with ten scores as the backup to Bo Levi Mitchell. He was primarily used in short yardage situations due to his speed and running ability. Tate scored two one-yard rushing touchdowns in the Stampeders' 20-16 victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 102nd Grey Cup.\n"}

This designation is constructed around the ground ball fly ball ratio, which measures how frequently a pitcher gets batters out on fly balls versus ground balls.\n\nThe downside of a fly ball pitcher is that, in a ballpark where the design tends to favor hitters over pitchers (an example being Yankee Stadium), a fly ball pitcher will tend to give up more home runs, resulting in a higher earned run average.\n\nExamples include pitchers Sid Fernandez, Ted Lilly, Chris Young and Marco Estrada.\n"}

This facilitates the set up of stages, platforms and sound equipments during concerts and other concert-like performances that requires an elevated stage and good PA systems.\n\nDifferent technical equipments and a 4-side colour television projection system are also present to project the performer's image onto a screen, so that audience sitting around the rear side of the stadium can also see clearly.\n\nThe Hong Kong Coliseum offers both open and sheltered areas for holding conventions and conferences. The demountable open stage provides the arena with an excellent forum for public assemblies as well as staging live television broadcasts of opening ceremonies.\n\nThe reception room acts as an assistant facility for hirers of the arena and the conference rooms to accommodate visiting VIPs. The room can hold 60 persons.\n\nEven though its formal name in Chinese roughly translates to \"Sports Arena\", the venue often serves as a concert venue for popular singers. In addition, some universities rent it every year for congregation. Some performances like ice-skating also choose Hong Kong Coliseum as their stages. It is also used every year from 1991 to hold the Miss Hong Kong Pageant, except for 2008. It also hosts a part of the FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League (Before:FIVB World Grand Prix) for volleyball every year. On 3 June 2001, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for their Where Dreams Come True Tour supporting their album Coast to Coast.\n\nThe Hong Kong Coliseum was one of the venues for the 5th East Asian Games that was hosted in Hong Kong in 2009.\n\n"}

{"id": "16052764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16052764", "title": "Kickoff specialist", "text": "Kickoff specialist\n\nA kickoff specialist (KOS) is a seldom-used position in gridiron football. Kickoff specialists are members of the special teams. They are responsible for kicking the ball in the kickoff. These players tend to have a strong leg, often capable of making touchbacks, and capable of keeping a ball in the bounds of the field of play but do not have the accuracy or technique required to be a full-time placekicker or punter. Some kickoff specialists later become full-time placekickers, while some are marginal placekickers who are soon out of football.\n\nDue to modern roster restrictions (and a 2016 rule change discouraging the kicking of touchbacks by awarding the receiving team possession at the 25-yard line instead of the 20), most NFL teams do not elect to have a kickoff specialist, and instead use their placekickers (or, less often, punters) on kickoffs. The most recent NFL kickoff specialist was Jordan Gay, who played the position for the Buffalo Bills under special teams coach Danny Crossman from 2014 to 2016. Prior to Gay's being claimed off waivers, Buffalo's kickoff duties were handled by Billy Cundiff and John Potter, who likewise were kickoff specialists during their time in Buffalo; for 2017, the team brought in former high school kicking phenom Austin Rehkow as a contender for the position but opted not to use a kickoff specialist that year. Other players who have spent at least some time as kickoff specialist for an NFL team since 2006 include Steven Hauschka, Rhys Lloyd, David Buehler, and Todd Carter. As of the end of the 2014 NFL season, punters Thomas Morstead, Matt Bosher, Sam Martin, Pat McAfee, and Michael Koenen handle kickoffs.There is at least one example of a backup quarterback serving as a kickoff specialist; in 1965, Bob Timberlake did so for the New York Giants. In high school football and most other professional leagues, such as the Arena Football League and, until recent roster expansions, the Canadian Football League, one kicker handles all three kicking positions. Even college football teams usually do not use kickoff specialists, despite the much larger rosters at that level; however, if an underclassman has a stronger leg than the upperclassman kicker, but is not yet ready to assume placekicker or punter duties, they will handle kickoff a while being the primary backup to the other positions.\n"}
{"id": "634056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=634056", "title": "Kingdome", "text": "Kingdome\n\nThe Kingdome (officially King County Multipurpose Domed Stadium) was a multi-purpose stadium in Seattle's SoDo neighborhood. Owned and operated by King County, the Kingdome opened in 1976 and was best known as the home stadium of the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL), the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB), and the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The stadium also served as both the home outdoor and indoor venue for the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League (NASL) and hosted numerous amateur sporting events, concerts, and other events. The Kingdome measured 660 feet wide from its inside walls.\n\nThe idea of constructing a covered stadium for a major league football and/or baseball team was first proposed to Seattle officials in 1959. Voters rejected separate measures to approve public funding for such a stadium in 1960 and 1966, but the outcome was different in 1968; King County voters approved the issue of US$40 million in municipal bonds to construct the stadium. Construction began in 1972 and the stadium opened in 1976 as the home stadium of the Sounders and Seahawks. The Mariners moved in the following year, and the SuperSonics moved in the next year, only to move back to the Seattle Center Coliseum in 1985. The stadium hosted several major sports events, including the Soccer Bowl in August 1976, the Pro Bowl in January 1977, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in July 1979, the NBA All-Star Game in 1987, and the NCAA Final Four in 1984, 1989, and 1995.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Seahawks' and Mariners' respective ownership groups began to question the suitability of the Kingdome as a venue for each team, threatening to relocate unless new, publicly funded stadiums were built. At issue was the fact that neither team saw their shared tenancy as profitable, as well as the integrity of the stadium's roof as highlighted by the collapse of ceiling tiles onto the seating area before a scheduled Mariners game. As a result, public funding packages for new, purpose-built stadiums for the Mariners and Seahawks were approved in 1995 and 1997, respectively. The Mariners moved to Safeco Field midway through the 1999 season, and the Seahawks temporarily moved to Husky Stadium after the 1999 season. The Kingdome was demolished by implosion on March 26, 2000; the Seahawks' new stadium, Seahawks Stadium (now known as CenturyLink Field) was built on the site and opened in 2002.\n\nKing County paid off the bonds used to build and repair the Kingdome in 2015, 15 years after its demolition.\n\nIn 1959, Seattle restaurateur David L. Cohn wrote a letter to the Seattle City Council suggesting the city needed a covered stadium for a major professional sports franchise. A domed stadium was thought to be a must due to Seattle's frequent rain. At the time, the city had Husky Stadium and Sick's Stadium for collegiate football and minor league baseball, respectively, but both were deemed inadequate for a major league team.\n\nIn 1960, the city council placed a $15 million bond issue measure on the ballot to fund construction of a stadium, but voters rejected it due to doubt the stadium could be built within that budget, and lack of a guarantee the city would have a team to play in the stadium. By 1966, the National Football League and the American League were both considering granting the city an expansion franchise, and as a result the King County Council placed another bond issue measure on the ballot, which was also rejected by voters.\n\nIn 1967, the American League granted Seattle an expansion franchise that would be known as the Seattle Pilots. The league clearly stated Sick's Stadium was not adequate as a major-league stadium, and stipulated that as a condition of being awarded the franchise, bonds had to be issued to fund construction of a domed stadium that had to be completed by 1970; additionally, the capacity at Sick's Stadium had to be expanded from 11,000 to 30,000 by Opening Day 1969, when the team was scheduled to begin playing. The Pilots were supposed to begin play in 1971 along with the Kansas City Royals. However, when Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri got wind of those plans, he demanded both teams begin play in 1969. The American League had birthed the Royals and Pilots as a result of the Kansas City Athletics moving to Oakland, and Symington would not accept the prospect of Kansas City waiting three years for baseball's return.\n\nIn February 1968, as part of the Forward Thrust group of bond propositions, King County voters approved the issue of $40 million in bonds to fund construction of the \"King County Multipurpose Domed Stadium.\" That year a committee considered over 100 sites throughout Seattle and King County for the stadium, and unanimously decided the best site would be on the grounds of Seattle Center, site of the 1962 World's Fair. Community members decried the idea, claiming the committee was influenced by special interest groups.\nThe Pilots began play as planned in 1969, but Sick's Stadium proved to be a problematic venue for fans, media, and visiting players alike, and it soon became apparent that it was inadequate even for temporary use. The Pilots only drew 677,000 fans that season, not nearly enough to break even, and a petition by stadium opponents brought the Sick's Stadium project to a halt. The Pilots' ownership group ran out of money by the end of the season, and with the stadium plans in limbo, the team was forced to declare bankruptcy. Despite efforts by Seattle-area businessmen to buy the team as well as an attempt to keep the team in Seattle through the court system, the Pilots were sold to Milwaukee businessman Bud Selig, who relocated the team to Wisconsin and renamed it the Milwaukee Brewers a week before the start of the 1970 season.\n\nThe push to build the domed stadium continued despite the lack of a major league sports team to occupy it. In May 1970 voters rejected the proposal to build the stadium at Seattle Center. From 1970 to 1972, the commission studied the feasibility and economic impact of building the stadium on King Street adjacent to Pioneer Square and the International District—a site that ranked at the bottom when the commission originally narrowed the field of possible sites in 1968. This drew sharp opposition primarily from the International District community, which feared the impact of the stadium on neighborhood businesses located east of the site. The King Street site was approved 8–1 by the county council in late 1971, and the groundbreaking ceremony in 1972 was held on November 2. Several protesters attended the ceremony, disrupted the speakers, and at one point threw mud balls at them.\n\nOn December 5, 1974, the NFL awarded Seattle an expansion franchise to occupy the new stadium; the team was later named the Seattle Seahawks. Construction lasted another two years, and the stadium held an opening ceremony on March 27, 1976. It hosted its first professional sporting event two weeks later on April 9, an exhibition soccer game between the Seattle Sounders and New York Cosmos of the NASL. It set a record for the largest soccer audience in North America at 58,120.\n\nThe expansion Seattle Seahawks of the NFL played their first game ever on August 1, 1976, a preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers at the Kingdome. The Seahawks' first regular season game was against the St. Louis Cardinals at the Kingdome on September 12. At the end of that season, the venue hosted the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game, on January 17, 1977.\n\nThe Seahawks hosted Monday Night Football games at the Kingdome twelve times in its history and were 9-3 in those games. The Seahawks and the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders played five Monday Night games in the Dome in the 1980s with Seattle holding a 3-2 edge including a 37-0 blowout victory in 1986. The next year, in 1987, Bo Jackson of the Los Angeles Raiders rushed for 221 yards, the most ever on MNF, and scored 2 touchdowns. One of his scores was a 91-yard touchdown and the other was a historic plowing into Seahawks high-profile rookie linebacker Brian \"The Boz\" Bosworth.\n\nThe Kingdome's final NFL game was played on January 9, 2000, a first-round playoff loss to the Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins scored a fourth-quarter touchdown to win 20-17; it was the last NFL victory for Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino and head coach Jimmy Johnson. It was also the last event the Kingdome ever hosted before its implosion.\n\nThe Seahawks had an overall record of 104-84 () in the Kingdome, and were 2-1 in the postseason.\n\nThe first college football game played in the Kingdome was also in 1976, between the Washington State Cougars and USC Trojans on October 9. With 37,268 in attendance, USC running back Ricky Bell rushed for 346 yards and set the Pac-8 single-game rushing record, and the Trojans won by nine points, \n\nThe University of Puget Sound Loggers' and Pacific Lutheran University Lutes' success in bringing large crowds to the newly-opened Tacoma Dome in 1983, 1984, and 1985, enticed the Kingdome to move the rivalry game for the Totem Pole Trophy to Seattle. It was played in the Kingdome for two years – 1986 and 1987. While it was relatively successful for small college football, organizers realized that they would never get the 50,000 needed to fill the Kingdome and the game returned to Tacoma.\n\nThe stadium also hosted the WIAA high school football state championships in an event called the King Bowl from 1976 through 1994; the title games were moved to the Tacoma Dome in nearby Tacoma in 1995.\nThe Seattle and Tacoma Police Departments played a yearly game named the \"Bacon Bowl\" to raise money for charity from 1979 to 1999; it continued to be played at Husky Stadium, then CenturyLink Field until it was discontinued in 2005.\n\nShortly after the Pilots' departure for Milwaukee, the city of Seattle, King County, and the state of Washington sued the American League, claiming a breach of contract. The league agreed to grant Seattle another franchise in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, and the team that would later be known as the Seattle Mariners was born. The Mariners held their first game at the Kingdome in 1977 against the California Angels on April 6.\n\nThe Kingdome was somewhat problematic as a baseball venue: foul territory was quite large, outfield dimensions were quite small, and seating areas were set back far from the playing field, with seats in the upper deck as far as from home plate. Part of the problem was that the Kingdome was not a multipurpose stadium in the truest sense. Instead, it was built as a football stadium that could convert into a baseball stadium. For instance, most fans in the outfield seats on the 300 level were unable to see parts of right and center field; these areas were not part of the football playing field.\nFor most of the Mariners' first 18 years, their poor play (they did not have a winning season until 1991) combined with the Kingdome's design, led to poor attendance. Some writers and fans called it \"the Tomb\" (because of its gray concrete and lack of noise) and \"Puget Puke.\" After their inaugural home opener, the Mariners didn't have another sellout until 1990. At one point the Mariners covered seats in the upper decks in right and right-center with a tarp in order to make the stadium feel \"less empty\". Additionally, the Kingdome's acoustics created problems for stadium announcers, who had to deal with significant echo issues. However, when the team's fortunes began to change in the mid–1990s and they began drawing larger crowds, especially in the post-season, the noise created an electric atmosphere and gave the home team a distinct advantage similar to the effect on football games.\n\nDespite its cavernous interior, the Kingdome's field dimensions were relatively small. It had a reputation as a hitter's park, especially in the 1990s when Ken Griffey, Jr., Edgar Martínez, Jay Buhner, Alex Rodriguez and other sluggers played there.\n\nThe large number of in-play objects—speakers, roof support wires and streamers—contributed to an \"arena baseball\" feel. The Kingdome was somewhat improved in 1982 with the addition of a wall in right field nicknamed the \"Walla Walla\" (after Walla Walla, Washington), \" featuring a new out-of-town scoreboard, which was in play. In 1990 and 1991, the moving of home plate closer to the backstop, the addition of box seats down the third base line and the removal of a few rows of seats in left field reduced foul territory and increased outfield dimensions.\n\nThe most noteworthy baseball game in the Kingdome's history took place on October 8, 1995, when the Seattle Mariners defeated the New York Yankees 6–5 in 11 innings in the rubber game of the ALDS in front of 57,411 raucous fans. In the bottom of the 11th, Martinez doubled to left, sending Joey Cora and Griffey home with the winning runs and vaulting the Mariners into the ALCS for the first time in franchise history.\n\nIn 1996, a game between the Mariners and the Cleveland Indians on May 2 in the Kingdome was suspended in the home half of the seventh inning because of a minor earthquake. The earthquake occurred during a pitching change as Indians' pitcher Orel Hershiser was walking off the mound following a home run by Edgar Martínez. After an inspection by engineers, the game was continued the next evening, resulting in a win for the Indians.\n\nIn 1989, Griffey Jr., in his first-ever plate appearance at the Kingdome on April 10, hit a home run. On June 27, 1999, Griffey Jr. hit the last home run ever at the Kingdome against the Texas Rangers.\n\nBesides the Mariners and Seahawks, the stadium also hosted the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics for a number of years. The 1978–79 season was the first year the Sonics played in the Kingdome on a full-time basis (they had played a few games there over the previous two seasons) with the addition of portable stadium seating added onto the floor of the arena as well as additional scoreboards and a new basketball court. Fred Brown and Gus Williams led the team that year to their first and only championship. At the time it was known in the NBA for being the noisiest arena for basketball as well as the largest crowds with stadium vendor Bill the Beerman taking the duties as cheerleader. In the 1979–80 season, the SuperSonics set an NBA record average attendance of 21,725 fans per game (since broken). In 1978, the SuperSonics set the NBA single-game playoff attendance record at 39,457, and then again in 1980 at 40,172 (also, since broken). The Kingdome regular season, single-game attendance record of 38,067 was set in 1991. The SuperSonics hosted the 1987 NBA All-Star Game there.\n\nLogistics would be a problem during the playoffs, as the Mariners (the Kingdome's primary tenants) objected to letting the Sonics play there in the spring. Therefore, the Sonics would only play home playoff games at the Kingdome while the Mariners were on the road, with most of the games played at Seattle Center Coliseum, and a few games had to be played at Hec Edmundson Pavilion at the University of Washington.\n\nSonics owner Barry Ackerley made the decision to leave the Kingdome and to build a new basketball arena. Plans were underway to build a new arena south of the Kingdome (where Safeco Field stands today) to be called Ackerley Arena, but after financing fell through, the team went back to the Coliseum for the 1985-86 season, playing occasionally at the Kingdome over the next few years. The Coliseum was eventually rebuilt as KeyArena, reopening for the 1995–96 season. The Sonics played there until the team was purchased and relocated by Oklahoma City businessman Clayton \"Clay\" Bennett before the 2008–09 season.\n\nThe NCAA Final Four of college basketball was held three times at the Kingdome – in 1984, when Georgetown defeated Houston, in 1989 when Michigan beat Seton Hall in overtime, and in 1995 when UCLA won their first championship since the retirement of coach John Wooden 20 years earlier in 1975, defeating Arkansas.\n\nThe Kingdome's first sporting event was a 1976 game between the NASL's New York Cosmos and Seattle Sounders on April 25, with 58,128 fans in attendance.\n\nThe Kingdome hosted Soccer Bowl '76 between the Minnesota Kicks and the Toronto Metros-Croatia on August 28, 1976.\n\nThe Kingdome hosted the 1984 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship Final between Clemson University, coached by Dr. I. M. Ibrahim, and defending national champions Indiana University headed by Coach Jerry Yeagley. Clemson University won in regulation bringing home its first national championship in soccer.\n\nThe Kingdome hosted the NFL Pro Bowl in 1977, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1979, and the 1987 NBA All-Star Game, making it the only venue that has hosted all star games for three major sports leagues.\n\nNumerous rock concerts were held in the venue, despite significant echo and sound delay problems attributable to the structure's cavernous size.\n\nIt also hosted a round of the AMA Supercross Championship from 1978 to 1999.\n\nThe largest crowd to attend a single event in the Kingdome came early, during an eight-day Billy Graham crusade in 1976. The Friday night edition on May 14 drew 74,000 and featured singer Johnny Cash; 5,000 were turned away.\n\nBy the 1990s, the stadium's suitability as an NFL and MLB venue came into doubt. Neither the Seahawks' nor the Mariners' respective ownership groups saw the shared stadium arrangement as economically feasible. After several years of threats to relocate the Mariners due to poor attendance and revenue, owner Jeff Smulyan sold the team to an ownership group led by Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi in 1992. Almost immediately, the new ownership group began campaigning with local and state governments to secure public funding for a new baseball-only stadium. In March 1994, King County Executive Gary Locke appointed a task force to study the need for a baseball-only stadium.\n\nThe Kingdome's roof had been problematic from the beginning. Leaks were discovered in the roof two months before the stadium opened, and several attempts at repairs made the situation worse and/or had to be undone. In 1993, the county decided to strip off the outer roof coating and replace it with a special coating. Sandblasting failed to strip the old roof material off, and the contractor changed its method to pressure washing. This pressure-washing resulted in water seepage through the roof, and on July 19, 1994, four , waterlogged acoustic ceiling tiles fell into the seating area. The tiles fell while the Mariners were on the field preparing for a scheduled game against the Baltimore Orioles, a half-hour before the gates were to open for fans to enter the stadium. As a result, the Kingdome was closed for repairs.\n\nThe Mariners were forced to play the last 20 games of the 1994 season on the road after the players' union vetoed playing the \"home\" games at Cheney Stadium in Tacoma, BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, or some neutral site, as the union believed its members should only play in major-league venues. The extended road trip could have lasted over two months, but was shortened due to the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, which began on August 12 and ended up cancelling the remainder of the 1994 MLB season and delaying the start of the 1995 season. The Seahawks had to play both preseason games and the first three regular-season home games of the 1994 regular season at nearby Husky Stadium.\n\nThe Kingdome held a reopening ceremony the weekend of November 4–6, 1994, which culminated with the Seahawks returning to the stadium for a regular-season game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Repairing the roof ultimately cost US$51 million and two construction workers lost their lives in a crane accident during the repair. The incident also motivated plans to replace the stadium.\n\nOn September 19, 1995, King County voters defeated a ballot measure that would have funded the construction of a new baseball-only stadium for the Mariners. However, the following month, the Mariners made it to the MLB postseason for the first time, and defeated the New York Yankees in the decisive 5th game of the 1995 ALDS on the heels of a walk-off game-winning double hit by Edgar Martínez. The Mariners' postseason run demonstrated that there was a fan base in Seattle that wanted the team to stay in town, and as a result, the Washington State Legislature approved a separate funding package for a new stadium.\n\nIn January 1996, Seahawks owner Ken Behring announced he was moving the team to Los Angeles and the team would play at Anaheim Stadium, which had recently been vacated as a football venue when the Los Angeles Rams moved to St. Louis. His rationale for the decision included unfounded safety concerns surrounding the seismic stability of the Kingdome. Behring went so far as to relocate team headquarters to Anaheim, California, but his plans were defeated when lawyers found out that the Seahawks could not break their lease on the Kingdome until 2005. As a result, Behring tried to sell the team. He found a potential buyer in Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who stipulated that a new publicly funded stadium had to be built as a condition of his purchase of the team. Allen funded a special election held on June 17, 1997, that featured a measure that would allocate public funding for a new stadium for the Seahawks to be built on the Kingdome site. The measure passed, Allen officially purchased the team, and the Kingdome's fate was sealed.\n\nThe Mariners played their final game in the Kingdome to a sold-out crowd on June 27, 1999, and played their first game at their new home, Safeco Field, on July 15, nearly 3 weeks later. The Seahawks, meanwhile, temporarily relocated to Husky Stadium following the 1999 season. While the Kingdome was demolished, their new stadium, Seahawks Stadium, was being built on the Kingdome's footprint, and opened on time for the 2002 NFL season.\n\nControlled Demolition, Inc. demolished the Kingdome by implosion on March 26, 2000 (approximately the 24th anniversary of the Kingdome's opening), setting a record recognized by Guinness World Records for the largest building, by volume, ever demolished by implosion. The Kingdome was the first large, domed stadium to be demolished in the United States and the demolition of the Kingdome was the first live event covered by ESPN Classic. The Kingdome was demolished before the debt issued to finance its construction was fully paid and as of September 2010, residents of King County were still responsible for more than $80 million in debt on the demolished stadium. As of January 2015, the debt was expected to be retired by March 2015, nine months ahead of the original bond maturity and 15 years after the demolition in March 2000. The 2% of the 15.6% hotel/motel tax earmarked for the Kingdome debt no longer needed went instead to the county's 4Culture program for arts, heritage, and preservation.\n\nTwo separate facilities replaced the Kingdome.

{"id": "16867569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16867569", "title": "Long ball", "text": "Long ball\n\nIn association football (soccer), a long ball is an attempt to move the ball a long distance down the field via one long aerial kick from either a goalkeeper or a defender directly to an attacking player, with the ball generally bypassing the midfield. Rather than arrive at the feet of the receiving attacking player, the attacker is expected to challenge the opposing defence in the air, with other attacking players and midfielders arriving to try and take possession of the ball if it breaks loose. In Continental Europe the style is called kick and rush.\nIt is a technique that can be especially effective for a team with either fast or tall strikers. The long ball technique is also a through pass from distance in an effort to get the ball by the defensive line and create a foot race between striker and defender. While often derided as either boring or primitive, it can prove effective where players or weather conditions suit this style; in particular, it is an effective counter-attacking style of play in which some defenders can be caught off-guard.\n\nNot all lengthy passes are considered long ball play, and long but precise passes towards a particular teammate may not fit the description. Long-ball play is generally characterised by the relatively aimless nature of the kick upfield, with the ball simply being 'hoofed' high in the air towards the general location of the forwards, who, given the length of time the ball is in the air, will have time to arrive at the position where the ball will drop.\n\nThe 'long ball theory' was first discussed by a retired RAF Wing Commander—Charles Reep—in the 1950s in England. Reep was an amateur statistician and analyzed not only the number of passes that led to a goal, but also the field positions where those passes originated. Reep documented his findings in various publications including match day programmes.\n\nReep developed a number of concepts describing effective long ball play. 'Gulleys' refer to the optimum position between the corner flag and six yard box from which to make the final pass into the penalty box; the '3-pass optimization rule' emerges from the fact that a higher percentage of goals are scored in moves involving only three passes prior to the shot; the '9 shots per goal' maxim, stating that on average, only one goal is scored for every nine shots; and the 'twelve point three yard' position, which is the mean distance from the goal that all goals are scored. The long-ball game is also advocated in such books \" The Winning Formula: The Football Association Soccer Skills and Tactics\", by Charles Hughes, which demonstrates with statistics that a majority of goals are scored within 5 passes of the ball.\n\nJonathan Wilson criticises Reep's statistical analysis as heavily flawed. The 'three pass optimum', for example, comes in for particular criticism. Wilson notes that while Reep's statistics showed that a higher percentage of goals were scored in moves involving three passes, they also show that three pass moves account for a higher percentage of all shots. Instead, the percentage of shots for which three-pass or fewer account is higher than the percentage of goals for which they account, implying that moves involving more passes have a higher ratio of success. Furthermore, Reep's own statistics show that this trend becomes stronger at higher levels of football, indicating that moves with a greater number of passes become more effective amongst higher quality teams. Reep also fails to distinguish statistically between three-pass moves that emerge from long balls and those that emerge from other sources such as attacking free kicks or successful tackles in the opponent's half.\n\nThe long ball strategy has often been criticized as a method that has held back the England national football team. Hughes became the head of coaching at the FA in the 1990s, and used this position to promote his theory of long ball, which followed on from the work of Reep. Hughes and those who defend the tactic claim that time and time again, teams playing direct play have more success. At the 1994 FIFA World Cup, for example, the winning Brazil team scored the most goals from three or fewer passes, while the team to score from a move involving the most passes - the Republic of Ireland - were eliminated in the second round. While multi-pass moves such as those by Brazil against Italy in the 1970 FIFA World Cup Final or Argentina versus Serbia and Montenegro at the 2006 FIFA World Cup are widely lauded as brilliant examples of football, it is partially the rareness of success for such long moves that results in their appreciation and makes them ineffective tactics to attempt to replicate.\n\nIt is however used by teams desperate to score a goal before the end of a match, though this is probably as much due to the lack of time for a gradual build-up as it is for its perceived effectiveness. The long ball technique is also effective in lower level football matches since players lack skill to work as a team and pass the ball accurately up the field. A long ball is a quick counterattacking move and with a fast striker may produce multiple goals.\n\n\nThe long ball is sometimes criticized as being used by weaker teams with less tactical skill. In the hands of mediocre teams, or at the lower youth leagues this might be so. Analysis of its implementation at world-class levels however, shows that effective use of long-ball techniques can be found in numerous competitive World Cup or championship club teams. It can be used as a counterattacking style, or as a daring through pass when opportunities open up during a game. The long ball requires top level skill to implement correctly. Mere passing is not the only variable—intelligent running into space, good dribbling and crisp finishing are also required.\n\nOne of the best uses of the long-ball was Netherlands striker Dennis Bergkamp's goal against Argentina in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Dutch defender Frank de Boer initiated the move from near the middle of the field, with a long pass that curled over 7 opposing players. Bergkamp controlled the difficult ball, spun past a defender and smashed it home. The example illustrates the power of the long-ball style but also that it is more than simply pumping the ball upfield. Only Bergkamp's excellent skills were able to take advantage of the de Boer's outstanding, and daring pass. As such, it emphasizes that football is a game requiring not only a comprehensive package of individual skills, but imagination and creativity as well. Both are present in the long-ball style.\n\nContemporary teams like Norway and Sweden have also demonstrated the viability of the long-ball approach when executed with skill, precision and creativity by top players. Norway played a characteristic 4-5-1 formation in the 1990s and early 21st century. The left back would often hit long crosses to Jostein Flo, who in turn would head the ball to either one of the central midfielders or to the striker. This was known as the Flo Pass, and the Norwegian national team garnered much criticism for its perceived long-ball approach. Egil Olsen did, however, take the national team to two World Cups, and the long ball style of play is considered to have played an important role in accomplishing this.\n\nOne of the greatest of the Norwegian goals scored with this style was by the striker Tore André Flo during the 1998 World Cup. Similar to the Bergkamp goal, but played to an advanced man on the wing, it began with an extremely long pass from Stig Inge Bjørnebye. Flo was alone when he received. He ran on and cut inside to beat his defending opponent, then slotted the ball past the goalkeeper Taffarel. The Norwegians went on to upset the mighty Brazilian team in this match. However, Brazil had already won the group before this game took place while Norway needed to win.\n\nIt should be noted that accurate passes aimed at a specific player are examples of individual long balls, but do not represent the spirit of a team playing a long-ball game. In that situation, the team would be pumping long-balls up repeatedly into an area, rather than a specific player, hoping the striker would get some of them and the percentages would pay off in the long-run.\n\nThe long ball can be very effective as a switch in game plan in pressure situations. In Chelsea's quarter-final victory over PSG in the 2013/2014 Champions' League, PSG needed to defend their 3-2 lead on aggregate for 10 more minutes when Fernando Torres entered the game as a substitute for Oscar. Chelsea's rehearsed gameplan for this scenario was to go direct from anywhere in the field, and PSG's defensive line fell very deep and very compressed. All secondary balls from either Chelsea or PSG players fell into spaces occupied solely by Chelsea players, leading to multiple goal scoring opportunities, one of which eventually taken by Demba Ba.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37779", "title": "Luge", "text": "Luge\n\nA luge is a small one- or two-person sled on which one sleds supine (face up) and feet-first. A luger steers by using their calf muscles to flex the sled's runners or by exerting opposite shoulder pressure to the seat. Racing sleds weigh for singles and for doubles. Luge is also the name of an Olympic sport.\n\nLugers can reach speeds of 140 km/h (87 mph). Austrian Manuel Pfister reached a top speed of 154 km/h (96 mph) on a track in Whistler, Canada, prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics. Lugers compete against a timer in one of the most precisely timed sports in the world—to one one-thousandth of a second on artificial tracks.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term \"luge\" dates to 1905 and derives from the Savoy/Swiss dialect of the French word \"luge\", meaning \"small coasting sled.\"\n\nThe very practical use of sleds is ancient and widespread. The first recorded sled races took place in Norway sometime during the 15th century.\n\nThe sport of luge, like the skeleton and the bobsleigh, originated in the health-spa town of St Moritz, Switzerland, in the mid-to-late 19th century, through the endeavours of hotel entrepreneur Caspar Badrutt. Badrutt successfully sold the idea of winter resorting, as well as rooms with food, drink, and activities. His more adventurous English guests began adapting delivery boys' sleds for recreation, which led to collisions with pedestrians as they sped down the lanes and alleys of the village.\n\nThe first organized meeting of the sport took place in 1883 in Switzerland. In 1913, the Internationale Schlittensportverband or International Sled Sports Federation was founded in Dresden, Germany. This body governed the sport until 1935, when it was incorporated in the Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT, International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation). After it had been decided that luge would replace the sport of skeleton at the Olympic Games, the first World Championships in the sport were held in 1955 in Oslo (Norway). In 1957, the Fédération Internationale de Luge de Course (FIL, International Luge Federation) was founded. Luge events were first included in the Olympic Winter Games in 1964.\n\nAmericans were slow to adopt the sport of luge. The first luge run in North America was built at Lolo Hot Springs, Montana, in 1965. Although the United States competed in every Olympic luge event from 1964 through 1976, it was not until 1979 that the United States Luge Association was founded. The first artificial American track was completed in that year for use in the 1980 XIII Winter Olympic Games at Lake Placid, New York.\nSince that time the United States luge program has greatly improved. A second artificial track was constructed near Park City, Utah, for the 2002 XIX Olympic Winter Games at Salt Lake City.\n\nArtificial luge tracks have specially designed and constructed banked curves plus walled-in straights. Most tracks are artificially refrigerated, but artificial tracks without artificial cooling also exist (for example, in St. Moritz). Tracks tend to be very smooth.\n\nThe athletes ride in a flat, aerodynamic position on the sled, keeping their heads low to minimize air resistance. They steer the sled mainly with their calves by applying pressure on the runners—right calf to turn left, left calf to turn right. It takes a precise mix of shifting body weight, applying pressure with calves and rolling the shoulders. There are also handles for minor adjustments. A successful luger maintains complete concentration and relaxation on the sled while traveling at high speeds. Most lugers \"visualize\" the course in their minds before sliding. Fastest times result from following the perfect \"line\" down the track. Any slight error, such as brush against the wall, costs time. Track conditions are also important. Softer ice tends to slow speeds, while harder ice tends to lead to faster times. Lugers race at speeds averaging around high banked curves while experiencing a centripetal acceleration of up to 5g. Men's Singles have their start locations near where the bobsled and skeleton competitors start at most tracks, while both the Doubles and Women's Singles competition have their starthouse located farther down the track. Artificial track luge is the fastest and most agile sledding sport.\n\nNatural tracks are adapted from existing mountain roads and paths. Artificially banked curves are not permitted. The track's surface should be horizontal. They are naturally iced. Tracks can get rough from the braking and steering action. Athletes use a steering rein and drag their hands and use their legs in order to drive around the tight flat corners. Braking is often required in front of curves and is accomplished by the use of spikes built on the bottom of the shoes.\n\nMost of the tracks are situated in Austria and Italy, with others in Germany, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Canada, Switzerland, Croatia, Liechtenstein, Turkey, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Bulgaria, Romania, New Zealand and the United States. The Upper Peninsula Luge Club in Negaunee, Michigan, is home to one of only five lighted natural track luge runs in the world, and the only natural track in the United States. The over 800 meter (half-mile) track features 29 curves along its vertical drop. The club hosts international luge events and offers luge instruction to the public during the winter months.\n\nWorld championships have been held since 1979 while European championships have been held since 1970.\n\nThere are four luge disciplines.\nThese are further broken into several age classes - multiple youth and junior classes that cover the range of age 7–20, and general class (ages 21 and older). Older competitors may enjoy the sport in masters (age 30–50), and senior masters (age 51+) classes.\nIn a team relay competition, one man, one woman, and a doubles pair form a team. A touchpad at the bottom of the run is touched by a competitor signaling a teammate at the top of the run to start.\n\nRules and procedures for races are very precise:\n\nThe sport of luge requires an athlete to balance mental and physical fitness. Physically, a luger must have strong neck, upper body, abdominal, and thigh muscles. Athletes also use Wind Tunnels to train Strength training is essential to withstand the extreme G-forces of tight turns at high speeds. Since lugers have very little protection other than a visor and helmet, they must be able to endure the physical pounding administered by the track when mistakes are made.\n\nAs with many extreme sports, luging has risks. Though most injuries involve bumps, bruises, broken bones and concussions, fatalities do occasionally occur. Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili suffered a fatal crash during his final practice run for the 2010 Winter Olympics on the Whistler Sliding Centre in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. Hours later, the International Luge Federation concluded that the accident was caused by a steering error and not a track error; nevertheless, changes to the track were made before the re-opening. Kumaritashvili was the fourth athlete to die while in preparation for a Winter Olympics competition, following speed skier Nicolas Bochatay, 27, who died while preparing for the Albertville 1992 games, British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypecki and skier Ross Milne, 19, who both died in the run-up to the Innsbruck 1964 games.\n\nThe sport of luge is governed by the FIL, Fédération International de Luge de Course. The FIL is located in Berchtesgaden, Germany, and includes 53 member nations. It is traditionally dominated by German representatives, however.\n\nThe following persons have been president of the FIL:\n\n\n\n"}

It houses Charles L. Cost Field, Vartabedian Field, and Ambrose Urbanic Field, the respective home practice and competition venues of the university's NCAA Division I varsity athletic baseball, softball, and men's and women's soccer teams. Known as the Pittsburgh (Pitt) Panthers, these teams compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The complex is located adjacent to the school's Trees Hall and Cost Sports Center near the remainder of the university's other upper campus athletic facilities.\n\nThe sports complex was a project that had been in development since the 1999 closure of Pitt Stadium on the university's campus. With the demolition of the stadium, the soccer teams, track & field teams, marching band and many intramural programs of the university lost their homes. The university's baseball and softball teams had long been playing in what had been deemed as inadequate facilities on Trees Field tucked behind the school's indoor Cost Sports Center. In the interim, the soccer teams had moved their home games to off-campus Founders Field in Cheswick.\n\nThe complex was built on the former Robinson Court housing project. The land was obtained after five years of sometimes contentious negotiations between the university, a housing developer, and the City of Pittsburgh. The final cost of the site for the university was a total contribution of $7 million in payments and community contributions which doubled the 2005 bid of several developers. The land sale was formally approved and Pitt acquired the parcel in the second half of 2008. Ground was broken on the complex in the fall of that year. The estimated cost of the complex's construction is $29 million. It is named after alumnus John Petersen and his wife Gertrude who donated an undisclosed amount for its construction. The baseball field has been named Charles L. Cost Field, after an alumnus who is also the namesake of the neighboring Cost Sports Center, while the softball field has been named Vartabedian Field and the soccer field has been named Ambrose Urbanic Field. The Petersen Sports Complex hosted its first official athletic contest with a March 16, 2011 baseball game between Pitt and Kent State. Grand opening ceremonies, termed the \"First Pitch Event\", occurred on April 9, 2011, and featured contests involving all four sports teams that will use the facility.\n\nFollowing completion of the sports complex, the former baseball and softball facilities on Trees Field are planned to be turned into a new track and field complex.\n\nThe Petersen Sports Complex includes three competition and practice venues, including for baseball, softball and men's and women's soccer. In addition, the complex includes a two-story, support building that houses locker rooms for each sport as well as dedicated equipment and athletic training facilities. An indoor batting practice facility, serving both the baseball and softball teams, is also contained within the facility and is located adjacent to baseball's Charles L. Cost Field. A concessions area is located within the portion of the support building that runs along the southeast goal line of the Ambrose Urbanic soccer field. Outside of the facility, a ticket book is adjacent to an entrance plaza that contains a depiction of the University of Pittsburgh's seal in its granite surface. Within the entrance plaza is a statue of the silhouette of an athlete representing each of the fours teams that call the complex home. Behind each of these figures are plaques honoring those that contributed to the construction of the facility.\n\nThe men's and women's soccer facility includes the 735-seat Ambrose Urbanic Field. Used for both practice and competition, the facility includes lighting and a press box. The soccer pitch will use the FIFA-certified \"Duraspine\" version of FieldTurf as found in Gillette Stadium and Qwest Field.

{"id": "24082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24082", "title": "Pole vault", "text": "Pole vault\n\nPole vaulting is a track and field event in which a person uses a long flexible pole (which today is usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber) as an aid to jump over a bar. Pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient Greeks, Cretans and Celts. It has been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and 2000 for women.\n\nIt is typically classified as one of the four major jumping events in athletics, alongside the high jump, long jump and triple jump. It is unusual among track and field sports in that it requires a significant amount of specialised equipment in order to participate, even at a basic level. A number of elite pole vaulters have had backgrounds in gymnastics, including world record breakers Yelena Isinbayeva and Brian Sternberg, reflecting the similar physical attributes required for the sports. Running speed, however, may be the most dominant factor.\n\nPoles were used as a practical means of passing over natural obstacles in marshy places such as provinces of Friesland in the Netherlands, along the North Sea, and the great level of the Fens across Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk. Artificial draining of these marshes created a network of open drains or canals intersecting each other. To cross these without getting wet, while avoiding tedious roundabout journeys over bridges, a stack of jumping poles was kept at every house and used for vaulting over the canals. Venetian gondoliers have traditionally used punting poles for moving to the shore from their boat.\n\nDistance pole vaulting competitions continue to be held annually in the lowlands around the North Sea. These far-jumping competitions (Frysk: \"Fierljeppen\") are not based on height.\n\nIn his book \"The Mechanics of the Pole Vault,\" Richard Ganslen reports that the London Gymnastic Society under Professor Voelker held measured pole vaulting events in 1826, involving 1,300 participants and recording heights up to . Other early pole vaulting competitions where height was measured took place at the Ulverston Football and Cricket Club, Lancashire, north of the sands (now Cumbria) in 1843. Modern competition began around 1850 in Germany, when pole vaulting was added to the exercises of the Turner gymnastic clubs by Johann C. F. GutsMuths and Friedrich L. Jahn. In Great Britain, it was first practiced at the Caledonian Games.\n\nInitially, vaulting poles were made from stiff materials such as bamboo or aluminum. The introduction of flexible vaulting poles in the early 1950s made from composites such as fiberglass or carbon fiber allowed vaulters to achieve greater height. Physical attributes such as speed, agility and strength are essential to pole vaulting effectively, but technical skill is an equally if not more important element. The object of pole vaulting is to clear a bar or crossbar supported upon two uprights (standards) without knocking it down.\nIn 2000, IAAF rule 260.18a (formerly 260.6a) was amended, so that \"world records\" (as opposed to \"indoor world records\") can be set in a facility \"with or without roof\". This rule was not applied retroactively, With many indoor facilities not conforming to outdoor track specifications for size and flatness, the pole vault is the only world record set indoors.\n\nToday, athletes compete in the pole vault as one of the four jumping events in track and field. Because the high jump and pole vault are both vertical jumps, the competitions are conducted similarly. Each athlete can choose what height they would like to enter the competition. Once they enter, they have three attempts to clear the height. If a height is cleared, the vaulter advances to the next height, where they will have three more attempts. Once the vaulter has three consecutive misses, they are out of the competition and the highest height they cleared is their result. A \"no height\", often denoted \"NH\", refers to the failure of a vaulter to clear any bar during the competition.\n\nOnce the vaulter enters the competition, they can choose to pass heights. If a vaulter achieves a miss on their first attempt at a height, they can pass to the next height, but they will only have two attempts at that height, as they will be out once they achieve three consecutive misses. Similarly, after earning two misses at a height, they could pass to the next height, when they would have only one attempt.\n\nThe competitor who clears the highest height is the winner. If two or more vaulters have finished with the same height, the tie is broken by the number of misses at the final height. If the tied vaulters have the same number of misses at the last height cleared, the tie is broken by the total number of misses in the competition.\n\nIf there is still a tie for first place, a jump-off occurs to break the tie. Marks achieved in this type of jump-off are considered valid and count for any purpose that a mark achieved in a normal competition would.\n\nIf a tie in the other places still exists, a jump-off is not normally conducted, unless the competition is a qualifying meet, and the tie exists in the final qualifying spot. In this case, an administrative jump-off is conducted to break the tie, but the marks are not considered valid for any other purpose than breaking the tie.\n\nA jump-off is a sudden death competition in which the tied vaulters attempt the same height, starting with the last attempted height. If both vaulters miss, the bar goes down by a small increment, and if both clear, the bar goes up by a small increment. A jump-off ends when one vaulter clears and the other misses. Each vaulter gets one attempt at each height until one makes and one misses.\n\nThe equipment and rules for pole vaulting are similar to the high jump. Unlike high jump, however, the athlete in the vault has the ability to select the horizontal position of the bar before each jump and can place it a distance beyond the back of the box, the metal pit that the pole is placed into immediately before takeoff. The range of distance the vaulter may place the standards varies depending on the level of competition.\n\nIf the pole used by the athlete dislodges the bar from the uprights, a foul attempt is ruled, even if the athlete has cleared the height. An athlete does not benefit from quickly leaving the landing pad before the bar has fallen. The exception to this rule if the vaulter is vaulting outdoors and has made a clear effort to throw the pole back, but the wind has blown the pole into the bar; this counts as a clearance. This call is made at the discretion of the pole vault official. If the pole breaks during the execution of a vault, it is considered an equipment failure and is ruled a non-jump, neither a make nor a miss. Other types of equipment failure include the standards slipping down or the wind dislodging the bar when no contact was made by the vaulter.\n\nEach athlete has a set amount of time in which to make an attempt. The amount of time varies by level of competition and the number of vaulters remaining. If the vaulter fails to begin an attempt within this time, the vaulter is charged with a time foul and the attempt is a miss.\n\nPoles are manufactured with ratings corresponding to the vaulter's maximum weight. Some organizations forbid vaulters to use poles rated below their weight as a safety precaution. The recommended weight corresponds to a flex rating that is determined by the manufacturer by placing a standardized amount of stress (most commonly a weight) on the pole and measuring how much the center of the pole is displaced. Therefore, two poles rated at the same weight are not necessarily the same stiffness.\n\nBecause pole stiffness and length are important factors to a vaulter's performance, it is not uncommon for an elite vaulter to carry as many as ten poles to a competition. The effective properties of a pole can be changed by gripping the pole higher or lower in relation to the top of the pole. The left and right handgrips are typically a bit more than shoulder width apart. Poles are manufactured for people of all skill levels and body sizes, with sizes as short as to as long as , with a wide range of weight ratings. Each manufacturer determines the weight rating for the pole and the location of the maximum handhold band.\n\nHowever speed is the most essential element to higher jumps, because the energy produced by the run (formula_1,formula_2=mass of the athlete;formula_3=speed) is converted to vertical propulsion (gravitational potential energy) (mass x height x acceleration due to gravity(formula_4)).\n\nCompetitive pole vaulting began using solid ash poles. As the heights attained increased, the bamboo poles gave way to tubular aluminum, which was tapered at each end. Today's pole vaulters benefit from poles produced by wrapping pre-cut sheets of fiberglass that contains resin around a metal pole mandrel, to produce a slightly curved pole that bends more easily under the compression caused by an athlete's take-off. The shape of the fiberglass sheets and the amount of fiberglass used is carefully planned to provide the desired length and stiffness of pole. Different fiber types, including carbon-fiber, are used to give poles specific characteristics intended to promote higher jumps. In recent years, carbon fiber has been added to the commonly used E-glass and S-glass materials to create a lighter pole.\n\nAs in the high jump, the landing area was originally a heap of sawdust or sand where athletes landed on their feet. As technology enabled higher vaults, mats evolved into bags of large chunks of foam. Today's high-tech mats are foam usually thick. Mats are growing larger in area as well to minimize risk of injury. Proper landing technique is on the back or shoulders. Landing on the feet should be avoided, to eliminate the risk of injury to the lower extremities, particularly ankle sprains.\n\nRule changes over the years have resulted in larger landing areas and additional padding of all hard and unyielding surfaces.\n\nThe pole vault crossbar has evolved from a triangular aluminum bar to a round fiberglass bar with rubber ends. This is balanced on standards and can be knocked off when it is hit by a pole vaulter or the pole. Rule changes have led to shorter pegs and crossbar ends that are semi-circular.\n\nAlthough many techniques are used by vaulters at various skill levels to clear the bar, the generally accepted technical model can be broken down into several phases:\n\nDuring the approach the pole vaulter sprints down the runway in such a way as to achieve maximum speed and correct position to initiate takeoff at the end of the approach. Top class vaulters use approaches with 18 to 22 strides, often referred to as a \"step\" in which every other foot is counted as one step. The run-up to the vaulting pit begins forcefully with the vaulter running powerfully in a relaxed, upright position with knees lifted and torso leaning very slightly forward. The head, shoulders and hips are aligned, the vaulter increasing speed as the body becomes erect. The tip of the vaulting pole is angled higher than eye level until three paces from takeoff, when the pole tip descends efficiently, amplifying run speed as the pole is planted into the vault box. The faster the vaulter can run and the more efficient their take-off is, the greater the kinetic energy that can be achieved and used during the vault.\n\nThe plant and take off is initiated typically three steps out from the final step. Vaulters will usually count their steps backwards from their starting point to the box only counting the steps taken on the left foot (vice versa for left-handers) except for the second step from the box, which is taken by the right foot. For example; a vaulter on a \"ten count\" (referring to the number of counted steps from the starting point to the box) would count backwards from ten, only counting the steps taken with the left foot, until the last three steps taken and both feet are counted as three, two, one. These last three steps are normally quicker than the previous strides and are referred to as the \"turn-over\". The goal of this phase is to efficiently translate the kinetic energy accumulated from the approach into potential energy stored by the elasticity of the pole, and to gain as much initial vertical height as possible by jumping off the ground. The plant starts with the vaulter raising their arms up from around the hips or mid-torso until they are fully outstretched above the head, with the right arm extended directly above the head and the left arm extended perpendicular to the pole (vice versa for left-handed vaulters). At the same time, the vaulter is dropping the pole tip into the box. On the final step, the vaulter jumps off the trail leg which should always remain straight and then drives the front knee forward. As the pole slides into the back of the box the pole begins to bend and the vaulter continues up and forward, leaving the trail leg angled down and behind.\n\nThe swing and row simply consists of the vaulter swinging the trail leg forward and rowing the pole, bringing the top arm down to the hips, while trying to keep the trail leg straight to store more potential energy into the pole, the rowing motion also keeps the pole bent for a longer period of time for the vaulter to get into optimum position. Once in a \"U\" shape the left arm hugs the pole tight to efficiently use the recoil within the pole. The goal is to carry out these motions as thoroughly and as quickly as possible; it is a race against the unbending of the pole. Effectively, this causes a double pendulum motion, with the top of the pole moving forward and pivoting from the box, while the vaulter acts as a second pendulum pivoting from the right hand. This action gives the vaulter the best position possible to be \"ejected\" off the pole. The swing continues until the hips are above the head and the arms are pulling the pole close to the chest; from there the vaulter shoots their legs up over the cross bar while keeping the pole close.\n\nThe extension refers to the extension of the hips upward with outstretched legs as the shoulders drive down, causing the vaulter to be positioned upside down. This position is often referred to as \"inversion\". While this phase is executed, the pole begins to recoil, propelling the vaulter quickly upward. The hands of the vaulter remain close to the body as they move from the shins back to the region around the hips and upper torso.\n\nThe turn is executed immediately after or even during the end of the rockback. As the name implies, the vaulter turns 180° toward the pole while extending the arms down past the head and shoulders. Typically the vaulter will begin to angle their body toward the bar as the turn is executed, although ideally the vaulter will remain as vertical as possible. A more accurate description of this phase of the vault may be \"the spin\" because the vaulter spins around an imaginary axis from head to toe.\n\nThis is often highly emphasized by spectators and novice vaulters, but it is arguably the easiest phase of the vault and is a result of proper execution of previous phases. This phase mainly consists of the vaulter pushing off the pole and releasing it so it falls away from the bar and mats. As the torso goes over and around the bar, the vaulter is facing the bar. Rotation of the body over the bar occurs naturally, and the vaulter's main concern is making sure that their arms, face and any other appendages do not knock the bar off as they go over. The vaulter should land near the middle of the foam landing mats, or pits, face up.\n\n\n\n\nThe \"six metres club\" consists of pole vaulters who have reached at least 6.00. In 1985 Sergey Bubka became the first pole vaulter to clear six metres.\n\nThree women have cleared 5 metres. Yelena Isinbayeva was the first to clear on July 22, 2005. On March 2, 2013, Jenn Suhr cleared indoors to become the second. Sandi Morris cleared 5.00 meters on September 9, 2016, to become the third.\n\nThis is a list of the first time a milestone height was cleared.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43596327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43596327", "title": "Stamford bull run", "text": "Stamford bull run\n\nThe Stamford bull run, or the bull-running in Stamford, was a bull-running and bull-baiting event held on St Brice's Day (13 November) in the English town of Stamford, Lincolnshire, for almost 700 years, until it was ended in 1839. The custom dated from the time of King John. A 1996 \"Journal of Popular Culture\" paper refers to the bull run as a festival, in the academic sense of \"the broader context of the medieval if not aboriginal festival calendar\", though works written during and shortly after the activity's later years variously describe it as a \"riotous custom\", a \"hunt\", an \"old-fashioned, manly, English sport\", an \"ancient amusement\", and – towards its end – an \"illegal and disgraceful ... proceeding\".\n\nAt least one other such regular event survived into fairly modern times, the annual 15 August Tutbury bull-running in Staffordshire, which was brought to an end in 1788, the year suppression of the Stamford run also began. Other such events had also been held in earlier times in Axbridge, Canterbury, Wokingham, and Wisbech .\n\nAccording to local tradition, the origin of the Stamford custom dated from the time of King John (1199 - 1216) when William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, standing on the battlements of the castle, saw two bulls fighting in the meadow beneath. Some butchers came to part the combatants and one of the bulls ran into the town, causing a great uproar. The earl, mounting his horse, rode after the animal, and enjoyed the sport so much, that he gave the meadow in which the fight began to the butchers of Stamford on condition that they should provide a bull, to be run in the town every 13 November, forever after. The town of Stamford acquired common rights in the grassy floodplain next to the River Welland, which until the last century was known as Bull-meadow, and today just as the Meadows.\n\nSimilarly, the Tutbury run had dubious legendary noble associations, in that case to the 14th-century figure John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster\n\nThe ringing of St Mary’s Church bells at 10.45 am opened the event, announcing the closing and boarding of shops and the barricading of the street with carts and wagons. By 11 am crowds gathered and the bull was released, baited by the cheering of the crowd, and (among other things) a man who would roll towards it in a barrel. It was then chased through the main street and down to Bull-meadow or into the River Welland. It was caught, killed, and butchered. Its meat was provided to the poor and as such the custom by the 1700s was supported as a charity by donations.\n\nSeventeenth-century historians described how the bull was chased and tormented for the day before being driven to Bull-meadow and slaughtered. \"Its flesh [was] sold at a low rate to the people, who finished the day's amusement with a supper of bull-beef.\"\n\nSuch an event was a time of drunken disorder. The custom was periodically suppressed and eventually ended in the 19th century. The bull-running in Tutbury, which was more violent and included mutilation of the bull, and involved folk from Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and Devonshire, was ended by the Duke of Devonshire in 1788. The same year, an unsuccessful attempt (the first recorded) was made to stop the Stamford event.\nThe bull-running in Stamford was the subject of an 1833 campaign by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Some Stamford residents defended their ancient custom as a \"traditional, manly, English sport; inspiring courage, agility and presence of mind under danger.\" Its defenders argued that it was less cruel and dangerous than fox hunting, and one local newspaper asked \"Who or what is this London Society that, usurping the place of constituted authorities, presumes to interfere with our ancient amusement?\" A rather noncommittal riot trial in 1836 tried only five men, and convicted a mere three; this inspired the town to plan an even bigger event for the next year. The mayor of Stamford – at the direction of and with the support of the Home Secretary – used 200 newly sworn-in special constables, some military troops, and police brought in from outside, to stop the bull-run of 1837, but it happened anyway. The bull and the people ran through the security line, a riot ensued, and in the end no one was killed (not even the bull, which turned out to have been supplied by or stolen from a local lord, discreetly unnamed in contemporary reports).\n\nThe last bull-run of Stamford was in 1839, in the face of an even larger force of soldiers and constables – some of the latter of whom smuggled the bull in themselves. The run was short, with the bull being captured by the peace-keeping forces quickly and without reported serious incident. Because the townsfolk were forced to bear the cost of this militia presence for several years in a row, they agreed to stop the practice on their own henceforth, and kept their word. The last known witness of the bull-running was James Fuller Scholes who spoke of it in a newspaper interview in 1928 before his 94th birthday:\n"}
