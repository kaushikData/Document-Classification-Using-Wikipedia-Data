Neither were satisfactory facilities mainly because they were open grounds on which spectators walked and animals grazed. Fences could not be erected to keep people and animals out or to charge much needed admission.\n\nWhen the Albert Ground opened in Redfern on 29 October 1864, these problems appeared to be solved. The ground had been developed as a money-making venture in the swampy area that Redfern was at the time.\n\nDespite this, the Albert Ground had significant advantages over Sydney’s existing cricket facilities. It was centrally located and featured good facilities for players and crowd alike. There was a grandstand in the north west corner and a pavilion ran around three sides of the ground. A row of trees had been planted by the English cricket tourists of 1863-1864 captained by George Parr.\n\nThe pitch was made of a matted couch grass and was very spongy and soft. It was a slow pitch that favoured the bowlers. The ground was the home of the Albert Club, one of the most powerful in Sydney, which could boast three teams of 11. The club’s players wore white caps and pants and blue shirts and counted amongst their number the greatest bowler of the day ‘The Demon’ Fred Spofforth.\n\nAbove all however, the Albert Ground had been established as a business with the aim of making money and fees were charged to those who wanted to use it, including the NSW Cricket Association. The cost to the NSWCA of staging matches there was so high that until the early 1870s it continued to use the Domain whenever possible despite its disadvantages. By then inter-colonial games had become so important and popular that the NSWCA had little choice but to use the Albert Ground for these at least. In all, five first-class matches were played at the Albert Ground between the 1870 and 1877 seasons.\n\nIn the late 1870s however, the Albert Ground company was wound up and the ground closed. The NSWCA began using the Garrison Ground at Moore Park, later to be renamed the Association Ground and then the Sydney Cricket Ground. Eventually the Albert Ground was demolished.\n\nThe Albert Ground was located to the east of Redfern Park in the block now roughly bounded by Elizabeth, Redfern, Kettle and Moorehead Streets. The site is now occupied by public housing.\n\nBelow is a list of the first-class cricket matches that were played at the Albert Ground.\n\nCashman, Richard (1990) \"‘The Demon’ Spofforth\" Kensington: UNSW Press\n\nPollard, Jack (1990) \"Australia\" In: Test Match Grounds London: Willow Books\n\nVamplew, Wray; Moore, Katharine; O’Hara, John; Chashman, Richard; and Jobling, Ian [editors] (1997) \"The Oxford Companion to Australian Sport\" Second Edition Melbourne: Oxford University Press\n\nWillis, James (1868) \"Map of Port Jackson and City of Sydney showing the adjacent municipalities NSW\" In: Sydney Takes Shape: A history in maps Paul Ashton and Duncan Waterson editors Brisbane: HEMA Maps 2000.\n\n"}

He is the founder of Accoona.com, a business-to-business search engine, and X3D Technology. He is the father of Vanessa Rousso, professional poker player and Big Brother contestant.\n\nFrench born entrepreneur Armand Rousso settled in the United States in 1982, working as a trader of stamps. In 1985 he stated he bartered $45 million (catalog value) in rare stamps.\n\nIn 1986, when the Internet was little known entity, Rousso started an online stamp exchange website, \"The International Stamp Exchange\", which lasted until 1990. The International Stamp Exchange was part of a network by David N. Glassman who created NaicoNet the first online retail online stock trading system. He thought online advertising revenues could be lucrative enough to make a business dedicated to philatelists profitable. Rousso and the ISE are profiled in the March 28, 1988 issue of New York Magazine.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, Rousso became involved with Philippe V. Hababou, a Frenchman convicted of check fraud. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to securities fraud and money-laundering charges; in 1999, he was convicted of securities fraud in France and was also noted in the investigation over illegal campaign contributions to the 1996 Senate campaign of Robert G. Torricelli.\n\nRousso was identified as having bought at auction the Treskilling Yellow, a unique Swedish postage stamp printed in the wrong color. The stamp had been auctioned on 22 May 2010, by David Feldman in Geneva, Switzerland, for at least $2.3 million, the world's record price for a stamp at auction. In May 2013 the stamp was acquired in a private sale by Count Gustaf Douglas, a Swedish nobleman and politician.\n\nRousso was founder of \"Accoona\", a B2B search engine. Launched in 2004 with former President Bill Clinton as chief announcer, the company failed to gain any significant part of the search engine market, though the online electronics retailers it also owns did make the company money. (Clinton reportedly made $700,000 for his Clinton Foundation in 2006 from selling Accoona stock.) The initial $80.5 million offering was underwritten by Maxim Group. However, as \"The New York Times\" reported, \"Accoona.com attracted only 106,000 visitors from the United States in July (2007), according to comScore, which monitors Internet traffic.\" The underwriter withdrew, possibly as a result of Rousso's checkered past. In 2008, the company was acquired by Masterseek.\n\nRousso is active in international chess and with his company X3D Technologies (which develops 3-D technology for the internet) sponsored several World Championship Matches, including Garry Kasparov vs Anatoly Karpov (2002) and Garry Kasparov vs X3D Fritz (2003).\n"}
{"id": "13723098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13723098", "title": "Charles Hoff", "text": "Charles Hoff\n\nCharles Hoff (9 May 1902 – 19 February 1985) was a Norwegian athlete, coach, sports journalist, novelist and sports administrator.\n\nAs an active athlete he competed in pole vault, long jump, triple jump, sprints and middle distance running events. He set four world records in the pole vault during his career, became Norwegian champion ten times in different events, and competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics. In 1926 he was excluded from the sport for professionalism.\n\nAfter his time as an athlete he took up a career as a sports journalist. During World War II he was a sports leader under the Nazi rule, leading the Norwegian Confederation of Sports from 1942 to 1944.\n\nHe was born in Fredrikstad as the son of mechanic Karl Ludvig Hoff and his wife Olga Kristine Karlsen. After taking the examen artium in 1921, he moved to Kristiania to attend the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry. He also briefly attended the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts as well as a painting school in Paris.\n\nHoff set his first world record in the pole vault on 22 July 1922 in Copenhagen with 4.12 metres. He increased this record to 4.21 metres exactly one year later in the same city, then to 4.23 metres on 13 August 1925 in Oslo, and finally on 27 September 1925 when he jumped 4.25 metres at a meet in Turku. The record stood until May 1927, when American Sabin Carr jumped 4.27 metres. Hoff was the first Norwegian athlete to establish a world record, the only to do so before World War II, and the only Norwegian ever to do so in a jumping event. After World War II, world records have been set by several Norwegian throwers and runners: Sverre Strandli, Audun Boysen, Egil Danielsen, Terje Pedersen, Grete Waitz, Ingrid Kristiansen and Trine Hattestad.\n\nInternationally he competed at the 1924 Summer Olympics, in both 400 and 800 metres. He reached the semi-final in the 400 metres and finished eighth in the 800 metres final. He did not participate in the pole vault due to an injured ankle. He was the Norwegian champion in the 200 metres from 1923 and 1924, in the 400 metres from 1924, in the pole vault from 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1933, and in the triple jump from 1922 and 1923. Representing the sports club Torshaug IF, Hoff won the King's Cup twice. In total he held fourteen Norwegian records in 200, 400 and 800 metres, long jump and pole vault.\n\nIn the winter of 1926, Hoff toured the United States, staging show competitions as a part of a varieté performance group. Among other things he beat Olympic gold medalist Harold Osborn in a heptathlon competition. He also set several unofficial world indoor records. Following this tour, however, he was considered to be a professional sportsperson. This affected his eligibility to compete in the sport of athletics as a whole, since the sport was governed under amateurist rules at the time. Hoff explained that the paid performances were necessary to earn a living, as the Amateur Athletic Union had withheld some money that had been promised to Hoff in advance, but to no avail. Thus, when jumping a new world record of 4.32 metres in Hønefoss on 27 September 1931, the record was not ratified by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF).\n\nIn December 1925 he married Heddy Aubert, a daughter of the Director General of Norsk Hydro, Axel Aubert. The marriage was dissolved after a few years, but Hoff married for the second time, this time to Aase Synnøve Bing Nilsen. Hoff was also a brother-in-law of Per Mørch Hansson.\n\nFrom 1927 to 1936 he was the editor of the sports magazine \"Sportsmanden\". He made his mark on \"Sportsmanden\" by emphasizing sensationalist news, front page headlines and the inclusion of pictures. The overall layout, which Hoff in retrospect described as \"revolutionary\", was inspired by his time in the United States. As a writer he was not uncontroversial, though, and after he was found guilty of libel, he was pressured by the magazine owner to resign. He found a new job as sports editor of \"Oslo Illustrerte\" from 1936 to 1940, and also wrote for the Nasjonal Samling party newspaper \"Fritt Folk\" in the late 1930s. He was also a coach in the Norwegian Athletics Association.\n\nWhen Norway was invaded by Germany in April 1940, many Norwegian athletes volunteered to fight in the Norwegian Campaign. Hoff then made his mark as he called on the fighters to lay down their weapons and return to the sports field. For this he was sacked by the Norwegian Athletics Association. However, Germany was able to establish an occupation of Norway, and soon moved to tighten their grip on Norwegian society. At this point Hoff contacted the \"Reichskommissariat\" to propose a Nazi reorganization of sports life in Norway. In September 1940 he was given the position as deputy under-secretary of state in the new Ministry of Labour and Sports, which was headed by Axel Heiberg Stang. He also joined the Nasjonal Samling at that time.\n\nHowever, the Nazi interference with sports resulted in a nationwide boycott of official athletics meetings in Norway from the end of 1940. When the reorganization of sports life was implemented in November 1940, the Germans, knowing that Hoff was unpopular, kept him out of the spotlight. Egil Reichborn-Kjennerud was installed as leader of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports, while Hoff used the Hird as an arena for his work. In the spring of 1942, it became clear that Reichborn-Kjennerud had failed to deal with the still-ongoing sports boycott, and Hoff became the new leader of the Confederation of Sports. He had a number of grand plans; sports in Norway should be state-led, and the aim was to produce a broad range of athletes rather than a few stars. In addition to the physical dimension, the \"spiritual\" dimension should be emphasized. He originally received generous funding, but from 1943 Germany lost interest in his projects, and in 1944 the projects were largely disestablished. Hoff protested this decision, and was removed from his position as a result.\n\nAs a part of the legal purge in Norway after World War II in 1947 he was sentenced to nine years of forced labour. A number of his ideas were actually realized some years later, including a national school of sport sciences and a state-owned gambling company. Norsk Tipping was established already in 1948, and the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in 1968.\n\nAfter serving his sentence, Hoff worked as an editor in the publishing house Hauge & Co. In 1952 he published the crime novel \"Døden i Bygdø Allé\", under the pseudonym Texas Bang. He had formerly published the novel \"Systemet\" in 1925 as well as a retelling of his experiences in the United States, titled \"Fra New York til Hollywood. Mine oplevelser i Amerika\", in 1927. Hoff died in 1985 in Oslo.\n"}
{"id": "16975268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16975268", "title": "Chess theory", "text": "Chess theory\n\nThe game of chess is commonly divided into three phases: the opening, middlegame, and endgame. There is a large body of theory regarding how the game should be played in each of these phases, especially the opening and endgame. Those who write about chess theory, who are often also eminent players, are referred to as \"theorists\" or \"theoreticians\".\n\n\"Opening theory\" commonly refers to consensus, broadly represented by current literature on the openings. \"Endgame theory\" consists of statements regarding specific positions, or positions of a similar type, though there are few universally applicable principles. \"Middlegame theory\" often refers to maxims or principles applicable to the middlegame. The modern trend, however, is to assign paramount importance to analysis of the specific position at hand rather than to general principles.\n\nThe development of theory in all of these areas has been assisted by the vast literature on the game. In 1913, preeminent chess historian H. J. R. Murray wrote in his 900-page magnum opus \"A History of Chess\"\nthat, \"The game possesses a literature which in contents probably exceeds that of all other games combined.\" He estimated that at that time the \"total number of books on chess, chess magazines, and newspapers devoting space regularly to the game probably exceeds 5,000\". In 1949, B. H. Wood estimated that the number had increased to about 20,000. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld wrote in 1992 that, \"Since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications. No one knows how many have been printed...\" The world's largest chess library, the John G. White Collection at the Cleveland Public Library, contains over 32,000 chess books and serials, including over 6,000 bound volumes of chess periodicals. Chess players today also avail themselves of computer-based sources of information.\n\nThe earliest printed work on chess theory, whose date can be established with some exactitude, is \"Repeticion de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez\" by the Spaniard Luis Ramirez de Lucena, published c. 1497, which included among other things analysis of eleven chess openings. Some of them are known today as the Giuoco Piano, Ruy Lopez, Petroff's Defense, Bishop's Opening, Damiano's Defense, and Scandinavian Defense, though Lucena did not use those terms.\n\nThe authorship and date of the Göttingen manuscript are not established, and its publication date is estimated as being somewhere between 1471 and 1505. It is not known whether it or Lucena's book was published first. The manuscript includes examples of games with the openings now known as Damiano's Defence, Philidor's Defense, the Giuoco Piano, Petroff's Defense, the Bishop's Opening, the Ruy Lopez, the Ponziani Opening, the Queen's Gambit Accepted, 1.d4 d5 2.Bf4 Bf5 (a form of the London System), Bird's Opening, and the English Opening. Murray observes that it \"is no haphazard collection of commencements of games, but is an attempt to deal with the Openings in a systematic way.\"\n\nFifteen years after Lucena's book, Portuguese apothecary Pedro Damiano published the book \"Questo libro e da imparare giocare a scachi et de la partiti\" (1512) in Rome. It includes analysis of the Queen's Gambit Accepted, showing what happens when Black tries to keep the gambit pawn with ...b5. Damiano's book \"was, in contemporary terms, the first bestseller of the modern game.\" Harry Golombek writes that it \"ran through eight editions in the sixteenth century and continued on into the next century with unflagging popularity.\" Modern players know Damiano primarily because his name is attached to the weak opening Damiano's Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6?), although he condemned rather than endorsed it.\n\nThese books and later ones discuss games played with various openings, opening traps, and the best way for both sides to play. Certain sequences of opening moves began to be given names, some of the earliest being Damiano's Defense, the King's Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.f4), the Queen's Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4), and the Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5).\n\nDamiano's book was followed by general treatises on chess play by Ruy López de Segura (1561), Giulio Cesare Polerio (1590), Gioachino Greco (c. 1625), Joseph Bertin (1735), and François-André Danican Philidor (1749).\n\nThe first author to attempt a comprehensive survey of the openings then known was Aaron Alexandre in his 1837 work \"Encyclopedie des echecs\". According to Hooper and Whyld, \"[Carl] Jaenisch produced the first openings analysis on modern lines in his \"Analyse nouvelle des ouvertures\" (1842-43).\" In 1843, Paul Rudolf von Bilguer published the German \"Handbuch des Schachspiels\", which combined the virtues of Alexandre and Jaenisch's works. The \"Handbuch\", which went through several editions, last being published in several parts in 1912–16, was one of the most important opening references for many decades. The last edition of the \"Handbuch\" was edited by Carl Schlechter, who had drawn a match for the World Championship with Emanuel Lasker in 1910. International Master William Hartston called it \"a superb work, perhaps the last to encase successfully the whole of chess knowledge within a single volume.\"\n\nThe English master Howard Staunton, perhaps the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, included over 300 pages of analysis of the openings in his 1847 treatise \"The Chess Player's Handbook.\" That work immediately became the standard reference work in English-speaking countries, and was reprinted 21 times by 1935. However, \"as time passed a demand arose for more up-to-date works in English\". Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Champion, widely considered the \"father of modern chess,\" extensively analyzed various double king-pawn openings (beginning 1.e4 e5) in his book \"The Modern Chess Instructor\", published in 1889 and 1895. Also in 1889, E. Freeborough and the Reverend C.E. Ranken published the first edition of \"Chess Openings Ancient and Modern\"; later editions were published in 1893, 1896, and 1910. In 1911, R.C. Griffith and J.H. White published the first edition of \"Modern Chess Openings\". It is now the longest-published opening treatise in history; the fifteenth edition (commonly called \"MCO-15\"), by Grandmaster Nick de Firmian, was published in April 2008.\n\nAccording to Hooper and Whyld, the various editions of \"Modern Chess Openings\", the last edition of the \"Handbuch\", and the fourth edition of Ludvig Collijn's \"Larobok\" (in Swedish), with groundbreaking contributions by Rubinstein, Reti, Spielmann and Nimzowitch \"were the popular reference sources for strong players between the two world wars.\" In 1937-39 former World Champion Max Euwe published a twelve-volume opening treatise, \"De theorie der schaakopeningen\", in Dutch. It was later translated into other languages.\n\nIn the late 1930s to early 1950s Reuben Fine, one of the world's strongest players, also became one of its leading theoreticians, publishing important works on the opening, middlegame, and endgame. These began with his revision of \"Modern Chess Openings\", which was published in 1939. In 1943, he published \"Ideas Behind the Chess Openings\", which sought to explain the principles underlying the openings. In 1948, he published his own opening treatise, \"Practical Chess Openings\", a competitor to \"MCO\". In 1964, International Master I.A. Horowitz published the 789-page tome \"Chess Openings: Theory and Practice\", which in addition to opening analysis includes a large number of illustrative games.\n\nIn 1966, the first volume of \"Chess Informant\" was published in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, containing 466 annotated games from the leading chess tournaments and matches of the day. The hugely influential \"Chess Informant\" series has revolutionized opening theory. Its great innovation is that it expresses games in languageless figurine algebraic notation and annotated them using no words, but rather seventeen symbols, whose meanings were explained at the beginning of the book in six different languages. This enabled readers around the world to read the same games and annotations, thus greatly accelerating the dissemination of chess ideas and the development of opening theory. The editors of \"Chess Informant\" later introduced other publications using the same principle, such as the five-volume \"Encyclopedia of Chess Openings\" and \"Encyclopedia of Chess Endings\" treatises. \"Chess Informant\" was originally published twice a year, and since 1991 has been published thrice annually. Volume 100 was published in 2007. It now uses 57 symbols, explained in 10 languages, to annotate games (see punctuation (chess)), and is available in both print and electronic formats. In 2005, former World Champion Garry Kasparov wrote, \"We are all Children of the \"Informant\".\"\n\nIn the 1990s and thereafter, the development of opening theory has been further accelerated by such innovations as extremely strong chess engines such as Fritz and Rybka, software such as ChessBase, and the sale of multi-million-game databases such as ChessBase's Mega 2013 database, with over 5.4 million games. Today, the most important openings have been analyzed over 20 moves deep, sometimes well into the endgame, and it is not unusual for leading players to introduce theoretical novelties on move 25 or even later.\n\nThousands of books have been written on chess openings. These include both comprehensive openings encyclopedias such as the \"Encyclopedia of Chess Openings\" and \"Modern Chess Openings\"; general treatises on how to play the opening such as \"Mastering the Chess Openings\" (in four volumes), by International Master John L. Watson; and myriad books on specific openings, such as \"Understanding the Grünfeld\" and \"Chess Explained: The Classical Sicilian\". \"Books and monographs on openings are popular, and as they are thought to become out of date quickly there is a steady supply of new titles.\" According to Andrew Soltis, \"Virtually all the new information about chess since 1930 has been in the opening.\"\n\nMiddlegame theory is considerably less developed than either opening theory or endgame theory. Watson writes, \"Players wishing to study this area of the game have a limited and rather unsatisfactory range of resources from which to choose.\"\n\nOne of the earliest theories to gain attention was that of William Steinitz, who posited that a premature attack against one's opponent in an equal position could be repelled by skillful defence, and so a player's best bet was to slowly maneuver with the goal of accumulating small advantages. Emanuel Lasker in \"Lasker's Manual of Chess\" and Max Euwe in \"The Development of Chess Style\" outlined theories that they attributed to Steinitz.\n\nLeading player and theorist Aron Nimzowitsch's influential books, \"My System\" (1925), \"Die Blockade\" (1925) (in German), and \"Chess Praxis\" (1936), are among the most important works on the middlegame. Nimzowitsch called attention to the possibility of letting one's opponent occupy the centre with pawns while you exert control with your pieces as in the Nimzo-Indian or Queen's Indian defences. He pointed out how in positions with interlocking pawn chains, one could attack the chain at its base by advancing one's own pawns and carrying out a freeing move (pawn break). He also drew attention to the strategy of occupying open files with one's rooks in order to later penetrate to the seventh rank where they could attack the enemy pawns and hem in the opponent's king. Another of his key concepts was prophylaxis, moves aimed at limiting the opponent's mobility to the point where he would no longer have any useful moves.\n\nIn 1952, Fine published the 442-page \"The Middle Game in Chess\", perhaps the most comprehensive treatment of the subject up until that time. The mid-20th century also saw the publication of \"The Middle Game\", volumes 1 and 2, by former World Champion Max Euwe and Hans Kramer, and a series of books by the Czechoslovak-German grandmaster Luděk Pachman: three volumes of \"Complete Chess Strategy\", \"Modern Chess Strategy\", \"Modern Chess Tactics\", and \"Attack and Defense in Modern Chess Tactics\".\n\nAnother key turning point in middlegame theory came with the release of Alexander Kotov's book \"Think like a Grandmaster\" in 1971. Kotov outlined how a player calculates by developing a tree of variations in his head, and recommended that players only examine each branch of the tree once. He also noted how some players seem to fall victim to what is now known as Kotov's Syndrome: they calculate out a large range of different lines, become dissatisfied with the result, and realizing that they are short on time, play a completely new candidate move without even checking whether it is sound. More recently, Jonathan Tisdall, John Nunn and Andrew Soltis have elaborated on Kotov's tree theory further.\n\nIn 1999, Watson's \"Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy: Advances Since Nimzowitsch\" was published, in which Watson discusses the revolution in middlegame theory that has occurred since Nimzowitsch's time.\n\nThere are also many books on specific aspects of the middlegame, such as \"The Art of Attack in Chess\" by Vladimir Vuković, \"The Art of Sacrifice in Chess\" by Rudolf Spielmann, \"The Art of the Checkmate\" by Georges Renaud and Victor Kahn, \"The Basis of Combination in Chess\" by J. du Mont, and \"The Art of Defense in Chess\" by Andrew Soltis.\n\nMany significant chess treatises, beginning with the earliest works, have included some analysis of the endgame. Lucena's book (c. 1497) concluded with 150 examples of endgames and chess problems.\n\nThe second edition (1777) of Philidor's \"Analyse du jeu des Échecs\" devoted 75 pages of analysis to various endgames. These included a number of theoretically important endings, such as rook and bishop versus rook, queen versus rook, queen versus rook and pawn, and rook and pawn versus rook. Certain positions in the endings of rook and bishop versus rook, rook and pawn versus rook, and queen versus rook have become known as Philidor's position. Philidor concluded his book with two pages of (in the English translation), \"Observations on the ends of parties\", in which he set forth certain general principles about endings, such as: \"Two knights alone cannot mate\" (see two knights endgame), the ending with a bishop and rook pawn whose queening square is on the opposite color from the bishop is drawn (see wrong rook pawn#Bishop and pawn), and a queen beats a bishop and knight (see pawnless chess endgame#Queen versus two minor pieces).\n\nStaunton's \"The Chess-Player's Handbook\" (1847) includes almost 100 pages of analysis of endgames.\n\nIn 1941 Reuben Fine published his monumental 573-page treatise \"Basic Chess Endings\", the first attempt at a comprehensive treatise on the endgame. A new edition, revised by Pal Benko, was published in 2003.\n\nSoviet writers published an important series of books on specific endings: \"Rook Endings\" by Grigory Levenfish and Vasily Smyslov, \"Pawn Endings\" by Yuri Averbakh and I. Maizelis, \"Queen and Pawn Endings\" by Averbakh, \"Bishop Endings\" by Averbakh, \"Knight Endings\" by Averbakh and Vitaly Chekhover, \"Bishop v. Knight Endings\" by Yuri Averbakh, \"Rook v. Minor Piece Endings\" by Averbakh, and \"Queen v. Rook/Minor Piece Endings\" by Averbakh, Chekhover, and V. Henkin. These books by Averbakh and others were collected into the five-volume \"Comprehensive Chess Endings\" in English.\n\nIn recent years, computer-generated endgame tablebases have revolutionized endgame theory, conclusively showing best play in many complicated endgames that had vexed human analysts for over a century, such as queen and pawn versus queen. They have also overturned human theoreticians' verdicts on a number of endgames; for example by proving that the two bishops versus knight ending, which had been thought drawn for over a century, can be a win for the bishops (see pawnless chess endgame#Minor pieces only and Chess endgame#Effect of tablebases on endgame theory).\n\nSeveral important works on the endgame have been published in recent years, among them \"Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual\", \"Fundamental Chess Endings\" by Karsten Müller and Frank Lamprecht, \"Basic Endgames: 888 Theoretical Positions\" by Yuri Balashov and Eduard Prandstetter, \"Chess Endgame Lessons\" by Benko, and \"Secrets of Rook Endings\" and \"Secrets of Pawnless Endings\" by John Nunn. Some of these have been aided by analysis from endgame tablebases.\n\n"}

The Halliwick Ten-Point-Programme implements the concept in a progressive programme of mental adjustment, disengagement, and development of motor control, with an emphasis on rotational control, and applies the programme to teach physically disabled people balance control, swimming, and independence. Halliwick Aquatic Therapy (also known as Water Specific Therapy, WST), implements the concept in patient-specific aquatic therapy for application in rehabilitation of injury and disability.\n\nThe Halliwick Concept was originally developed by fluid mechanics engineer James McMillan in the late 1940s and 1950s, at the Halliwick School for Girls with Disabilities in London, to teach physically disabled people independence in water. Based on fluid mechanics, McMillan developed teaching and therapeutic approaches to enhance sense of balance (equilibrioception) and core stability.\n\nAccording to the Halliwick Concept, physical properties of water form the basis for therapeutic intervention:\n\nThe first part of the concept, the Halliwick Ten-Point-Programme, incorporates these biophysical principles and focuses on mental adjustment, disengagement, and development of motor control, with an emphasis on rotational control, and is applied to teach participation in water activities, moving independently in water, and swimming. McMillan emphasized participation and independence: the willingness to lose balance and knowing how to stand up again. \n\nThe second part of the concept, Halliwick Aquatic Therapy (also known as Water Specific Therapy, WST), applies the fundamental biophysical principles and the underlying principles of the Ten-Point-Programme for planning and implementing patient-specific aquatic therapy.\n\nThe first part of the Halliwick Concept implements the Halliwick Ten-Point-Programme to develop balance control, swimming skills, and indendence:\n\nThe second part of the Halliwick Concept, known as Halliwick Aquatic Therapy (also called Water Specific Therapy, WST) is an aquatic therapy approach developed in Bad Ragaz, Switzerland since 1974. Halliwick Aquatic Therapy is a system-oriented aquatic motor (re)learning approach, which includes elements of the Ten-Point-Programme. It uses a holistic task-directed approach within the context of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), in particular postural control, normalizing muscle stiffness, and facilitation of movement to attain functional goals on land. It also follows training guidelines of physiology and its clinical reasoning in various patient populations. Most Halliwick therapy is active (dynamic) to facilitate movement and sensory input. Halliwick also has a passive (static) component, in which, for example involving selective activation of muscles and stabilization of specific joints by the therapist. Halliwick Aquatic Therapy is a problem-solving approach, in that specific possibilities and constraints of the client are analyzed in order to plan a systematic intervention to help the client gain functional increases.\n\nThe Halliwick Ten-Point-Programme has been applied for teaching swimming to people with disability, as well as more broadly as a general approach to teaching swimming and working with disability. \n\nHalliwick Aquatic Therapy has mainly used in neurorehabilitation and pediatrics. It has resemblances to Bobath and Conductive education. In neurological and paediatric rehabilitation, clients can experience early mobility. The mechanical advantages of water support the abilities of the trunk in a mobilising and stabilising way. In this sense Halliwick is a constraint-induced movement therapy without the disadvantage of gravity compensation. Many activities easily can be repeated and varied and clients can learn balance- and stumble- strategies, which have carry-over effects to dry land. This application in fall prevention is extended by using obstacle courses or Ai Chi.\n\nHalliwick also enables a graded activity programme: with low mechanical impact and increasing physiological demand, chronic low back pain patients and others can increase their functional capacity in a mostly joyful way.\n\n"}

The first running of the Lincoln was won by Slightly Polly trained by Arthur Doc Callanan. In 1949 the freehold was finally bought outright by the Kings Heath Racecourse Ltd. The track was described as a fair sized course with fairly easy turns and a good length run in despite the circuit having a small 390 yard circumference. The main distances were 480 and 675 yards and greyhounds chased an ‘Outside Sumner’ hare. On the Alcester Road South entrance there was the main stand featuring the Silver Club and Best Ring Club with matching betting rings. On the opposite side of the course were two covered stands, to the west was the popular betting ring and to the east were the racing kennels, isolation kennels and home kennels that included a rest room and surgery. Rest kennels were located at Cookhill in Worcestershire. Perspective owners had to pay kennel charges of one guinea per week and the greyhound would be accepted into the track kennels on the understanding that all greyhounds were subject to veterinary examination, National Greyhound Racing Club rules and company conditions.\n\nThe first track trained success came in 1948 when King Hero trained by P.E Frost won the Cambridgeshire at West Ham Stadium. Another race called the Midland Oaks was introduced and trainers included Jim Todd, Bill Bryant, Alf Gibbins, Len Bane and Mr Allen.\n\nFollowing the 1964 closure of the Lythalls Lane Stadium in Coventry, a major race the prestigious Eclipse Stakes was transferred to the track. Following the formation of the Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) in 1967 the track was chosen as one of the first four tracks to host live betting shop race meetings along with Oxford, Park Royal and Stamford Bridge.\n\nIn 1971 developers bought the stadium from the Greyhound Racing Association who themselves had only purchased the stadium the previous year.

Under an agreement made in 1979, 40 percent of any surplus was to stay in Southern California, with the other 60 percent going to the United States Olympic Committee. The total surplus was $232.5 million. Southern California's share was approximately $93 million.\n\nThe LA84 Foundation's mission is to promote and expand youth sports opportunities in Southern California and to increase knowledge of sport and its impact on people's lives. Since inception, the Foundation has invested more than $225 million in Southern California by awarding grants to youth sports organizations, initiating sports and coaching education programs, and operating the world's premier sports library.\n\nGrants are awarded to organizations that provide on-going, structured youth sports programs combining the essential elements of teaching, learning and competition. The Foundation makes grants in the eight southernmost counties of California (Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura). Youth organizations in the Los Angeles area receive priority. The LA84 Foundation has made grants to more than 1,100 Southern California organizations since 1985.\n\nThe LA84 Foundation has initiated programs to meet the youth sports needs of Southern California and to create models that can be applied elsewhere. These include the LA84 Foundation Coaching Education Program as well as large-scale sports programs such as Summer Swim and Run 4 Fun, which serve nearly 20,000 children and teenagers each year.\n\nThe Foundation's headquarters is the historic Eugene W. Britt House, a Registered Historic Place located at 2141 West Adams Boulevard in Los Angeles' Jefferson Park neighborhood. It was formerly a sports museum that featured the Helms Athletic Foundation's collection of sports books, film, photographs and memorabilia. First Interstate Bank and the Peter and Ginny Ueberroth Foundation donated the Helms Collection, house and grounds to the LA84 Foundation in the summer of 1985.\n\nThe Paul Ziffren Sports Resource Center houses the world's premier sports library. The library maintains an extensive collection of books, periodicals, photograph and moving footage, with a special emphasis on the Olympic Games. The traditional library has been supplemented by the development of an extensive electronic collection of 100,000 PDFs including scholarly publications, popular magazine and primary historical documents available at no cost on the LA84 Foundation website.\n\nThe LA84 Foundation also hosts conferences and sponsors research on a variety of sport topics. The LA84 Foundations practical knowledge, acquired through years of direct involvement in youth sports, combined with its wide range of education services enables the Foundation to serve as a leading forum for the exchange of ideas and exploration of issues in sport.\n\nIn June 2007, the Foundation adopted the name LA84 Foundation to establish a unique identity and honor the spirit of the 1984 Olympic Games, which created the Foundation's endowment.\n\nThe swimming stadium used for the 1932 Olympic Games has been renamed the LA84 Foundation/John C.

The earliest known reference to cricket in Norfolk was in 1745. The first mention of a Norfolk representative team is in 1764, playing against Suffolk at Bury St Edmunds racecourse (today the location of Rougham Airfield) on 23 August. Norfolk won this match, which was reported in the \"Gazetteer & London Daily Advertiser\" on Tuesday, 28 August. Norfolk played two further matches against Suffolk on 10 and 12 September at Scole.\n\nThe first important Norfolk club of the 19th century was that based at Holt and an 1820 Norfolk v Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) match, in which William Ward made a then-record score of 278, was in fact the Holt Club with E. H. Budd, Thomas Vigne and Felix Ladbroke as given men. This was perhaps a \"borderline\" match in terms of its status but, because of its historical importance in the light of Ward's record and the addition of the three given men, the standard was above the general run of Holt/Norfolk matches. The Holt club declined from the mid-1820s.\n\nAfter that, the centre of county cricket was Norwich and a prominent club was founded there on 11 January 1827. For a few seasons, prior to Fuller Pilch's departure for Kent about 1835, Norfolk could put a fairly strong eleven into the field. Their only major county opponent, however, was Sheffield Cricket Club (playing as Yorkshire) and the five games they played in 1833, 1834 (twice), 1835 and 1836 are important.\n\nApart from the games against Yorkshire, the main opponents of the Norwich/Norfolk team were Bury/Suffolk and MCC. These games however were not quite in the class of the Yorkshire matches. Norfolk played Cambridge Town Club (a.k.a. Cambridgeshire) in the 1840s but Norfolk generally fared very poorly and by 1852 the team had lost important status. After the present Norfolk County Cricket Club was founded in 1876, the county did not regain important status and it joined the Minor Counties Championship when it was formed in 1895.\n\nThe following is a list of matches played by Holt, Norwich or Norfolk from 1818 to 1871; those marked with are definitely minor fixtures while the majority are potentially important matches depending on their treatments by different sources:\n\n\n"}

The evolution of the field hockey offside rule culminated with its abolition in the mid-1990s.\n\nA set of rules of field hockey was drawn up by several clubs in London in January 1876 following the establishment of the first, briefly existing, Hockey Association (of England) the year before. (The second, and final, Hockey Association was formed in 1886.) An offside rule was included in the 1876 rules. Under this rule, a player who was nearer to the opponent team's goal-line than both the ball and the third to last opponent was said to be at an offside position (simply put: an attacking player was offside if the ball was behind them and there were fewer than three defenders between them and the goal they were attacking). The rule was applied on the whole pitch, except when the ball was hit from the goal-line.\n\nIn 1886, the second England Hockey Association drew up a code of Rules based on those used by clubs in the London area.

Delays due to other forms of weather are named \"snow delay\", \"lightning delay\", \"thunderstorm delay\", or \"fog delay\" (or generically \"weather delay\"), while there are many other effects of weather on sport. Also, a night game can be delayed if the floodlight system fails. Often spectators will be issued a ticket for a make up event, known as a \"rain check\".\n\nSports typically stopped due to the onset of rain include baseball, golf, tennis, and cricket, where even slightly damp conditions in the latter three sports seriously affect playing quality and the players' safety. In the case of tennis, several venues (such as those of Wimbledon and the Australian Open) have built retractable roofs atop their existing courts and stadiums in the last decade to avert rain delays that could push a tournament further than the final date.\n\nAssociation football generally plays on through rain, although matches can be abandoned if the pitch becomes severely waterlogged or there is lightning in the area, with the latter case being more for the protection of spectators within the metal stands surrounding stadiums. In NCAA play, should lightning be detected by any pitch official, a minimum 30-minute delay and a potential \"rainout\" can be declared if the lightning continues for a considerable amount of time under the NCAA's all-sports policy regarding lightning.\n\nIn North America, the only one of the four major team sports to stop play due to rain is baseball. Individual sports such as golf, tennis and auto racing are also subject to rainouts, in the last case because a wet racetrack poses a risk of hydroplaning for vehicles traveling at high speeds, the combination of which can be fatal. Gridiron-style football almost always plays through even the heaviest of rain or snow, only canceling, relocating or delaying a game in the event that conditions are so severe as to be unsafe for spectators to attend (most commonly in the event of a lightning storm). Ice hockey, when played outdoors, may also be subject to rainouts or rain delays, as the conditions to maintain a playable ice surface depend on a narrow set of favorable weather conditions. Almost all meaningful basketball games are played indoors and are thus not subject to rainouts.\n\nIf there is severe rain during a match, it can become a point of controversy whether a match should be abandoned. A notable example of this was on the final day of the Serie A 1999-00 season, when Juventus had to play out a match against Perugia despite the pitch appearing to be unplayable. Juventus lost the match 1-0 and consequently lost the \"Scudetto\" to Lazio.\n\nGenerally, Major League Baseball (MLB) teams will continue play in light to moderate rain but will suspend play if it is raining heavily or if there is standing water on the field. Games can also be delayed or canceled for other forms of inclement weather, or if the field is found to be unfit for play, and for other unusual causes such as bee swarms. Bee delays and cancellations have occurred in games such as the spring training game in 2005 that was canceled, as well as the 2009 Houston Astros-San Diego Padres game that was delayed in the ninth inning. However, rain is by far the most common cause for cancellations or stoppages of play. In case of rain out after the game has begun but before it is official, a rain check is issued; this dates to the 1870s, but did not become widespread until the 20th century.\n\nBefore a baseball game commences, unless it is the second game of a doubleheader, the manager of the home team is in charge of deciding whether or not the game should be delayed or canceled due to rain or other inclement weather (see Rule 3.10 of baseball's Official Rules). Once the home team manager hands his lineup card to the umpire shortly before the game is to begin, the umpiring crew chief has sole discretion to decide if a game should be delayed or canceled (see Rule 3.10 and Rule 4.01 of the Official Rules). This also applies to the second game of a doubleheader. Umpires are required by rule to wait at least 30 minutes to see if conditions improve; this is referred to as a rain delay and is not counted as part of the length of the game listed in the box score. In practice, umpires are encouraged to see that games are played if at all possible, and will most of the times wait as long as three hours before declaring a rainout.\n\nIf a game is rained out before play begins, it is rescheduled for a later date. If it has already begun and rain falls, several scenarios are used to determine the need to resume play:\n\nThe scheduling of make up dates generally follow these guidelines:\n\n\nIn areas that receive high amounts of rain or otherwise could be impacted by the weather, those teams have built stadiums with a roof to protect the field, first as a domed stadium, and more recently with a retractable roof. Despite this, the Houston Astros—who played at the Houston Astrodome for 35 years and currently play at the retractable roof-equipped Minute Maid Park, primarily to protect fans from the intense summer Texas heat—ironically had a rainout at the Astrodome on June 15, 1976 due to intense flooding in the Houston area. The game, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, was later made up at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh despite the Astros still having a home series against the Pirates later that season. Also, Miller Park that opened in Milwaukee on April 6, 2001 has a fan-style roof that opens and closes.\n\nAlthough rare, a delay caused by snow has been known to happen in baseball. This is usually the case in the early parts of the season that, although always starts after the spring equinox, is still within the traditional snow season in the northern half of North America. In fact, the first ever game of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1977, although not delayed, was affected by a minor snowstorm. Although some areas of North America begin to receive snow in October, it is still too warm for snow to start accumulating, and with most teams done playing for the season by that point due to the MLB playoffs, is largely a non-issue anyway, and very rarely does the World Series extend into November—something that has only happened six times (2001 World Series, 2009 World Series, 2010 World Series, 2015 World Series, 2016 World Series and 2017 World Series).\n\nIn April 2007, snow storms in northern Ohio caused the Cleveland Indians to postpone their home opening series against the Seattle Mariners and forced the Indians to find a different location for their home series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. MLB took advantage of the roof at Miller Park (home of the Milwaukee Brewers) and moved the Indians-Angels series to Milwaukee. All seats were sold for $10 apiece, and attendance was 52,496 for the three games. The Indians-Mariners games were eventually made up at various points in the season, including one game at Safeco Field during their regularly-scheduled series in Seattle as part of a doubleheader in which the Indians were the designated home team for the first game.\n\nSome auto racing series do not compete in rain, especially series that race on paved oval tracks. The rain severely diminishes the traction between the slick tires and the surface. Other series, especially those that race on road courses such as Formula One and public roads as in rallying, use special treaded rain tires while the surface is wet but not in excessively heavy rain, standing water, or lightning (which is an automatic cessation of racing because of pit crew, race marshals, and safety). Dirt track racing can be run in a light rain as the vehicles have treaded tires. Rallying can be held in rain or snow.\n\nIndyCar and NASCAR do not compete on a wet or moist surface at most oval tracks. They will not start an event unless the surface is dry. If the surface become wet during a race, the event is typically halted, and the cars are pulled off the track. Very light moisture may warrant only a temporary yellow caution period, while heavier rains usually require a red flag, stopped condition.\n\nAfter the rain ceases, the sanctioning body will determine if the track surface can be dried within a reasonable time frame. The track is considered \"lost\" if rain thoroughly wets the surface, usually characterized by a dark look to the asphalt or concrete pavement. Track crews use jet dryers, which consist of modified jet engines, mounted upside down to allow the hot exhaust to pummel the surface. The hot exhaust acts to quickly evaporate the rainwater, and allow the surface to dry considerably quicker than normal conditions. Large scale wet-vacs are also sometimes used to supplement.\n\nThe safety car driver will work with race stewards on the proper decision on a red flag when rain falls. In NASCAR, if the race start is delayed, officials may ask a more experienced driver to evaluate if a track is sufficiently dry by having the driver run medium-speed laps around the circuit to evaluate the dryness of the circuit. He then reports the results to his crew chief, who sends a report to a NASCAR official.\n\nIn rain conditions, officials may start the race under the safety car, and wave the green after a few laps have been run under such conditions. In that situation, all Safety Car laps count towards the race distance, but in IndyCar and NASCAR, only after both green and yellow are waved together (some laps may be run beforehand that do not count). However, officials may only allow the laps to count if the green flag is the next flag to wave and not the red flag, and officials may discard all laps run if cars do not complete a lap under green flag conditions. This procedure may be used by officials in an attempt to reach the race to official race status (halfway or three-fourths).\n\nIf rain does not subside, the sanctioning body has several options. Typically, the race is considered \"official\" if has completed at least one lap beyond the halfway point of the advertised distance (similar to baseball). If such is the case, the race is deemed complete, and a winner can be declared. In some cases, if the race has already gone beyond the halfway point (especially if it is very near the scheduled finish) when rain falls, and the weather forecast is for day-long rain, no attempt to complete the remainder of the race will be attempted. If a downpour occurs very near the end of the race, the officials, in fact, may use their authority to wave the checkered flag at that instant, and end the race immediately (such as during the 1975 Indianapolis 500). However, if the event is stopped any lap before the halfway point, the remainder of the event can be postponed to the following day (such as during the 1997 Indianapolis 500). \n\nIndyCar and NASCAR both will use rain tires if they are at a road course. However, if the rain is severe enough where standing water, visibility becomes an issue, or if lightning is detected within a 12 km radius of the circuit, the race will be stopped. At the 2014 Honda Indy Toronto Race 1, IndyCar attempted to wave green and yellow together to start the race under the Safety Car. After numerous incidents, IndyCar decided to abandon the race and wiped the slate clean for Sunday with two races. IndyCar also has cancelled qualifying at a circuit because of lightning, primarily as a safety issue with electronics, radio communications, teams on pit lane, race marshals, and spectators.\n\nThe code in USAC, NASCAR, and IndyCar states if fewer than half the laps are completed or if the race is unable to start, the event is resumed on a later date, usually the next day. With the introduction of lights at numerous oval tracks, the time frame for resuming a rain delayed race on the same day has been largely expanded. Some races stopped during the day for rain have seen the track dried, and the race completed later in the evening on the same day. Since the 2017 season, all NASCAR national series utilize a format in which races are divided into three or four stages, with a competition caution after each; a race is considered official following the conclusion of the second stage, which is typically positioned around two quarters of the scheduled distance.\n\nMost road racing (except in the United States) does not use the 50 percent rule. In the FIA Code, if severe rain forces the race to be interrupted, the regulations state if less than three laps were completed, the race is canceled and will not be made up. Once a race is on its fourth green flag lap, the race is official, and only half points will be awarded until 75% of the race has been completed.\n\nThe 1976 Indianapolis 500 was the shortest Indianapolis 500 in history, one lap past official status, with 102 laps completed.\n\nThe 1976 Japanese Grand Prix was delayed because of rain. When the race eventually started, championship leader Niki Lauda pulled out because of the dangerous conditions, allowing James Hunt to score enough points to win the championship.\n\nThe 1992 Tooheys 1000 was drastically affected by rain, with the Dick Johnson Racing team leading the race on Lap 145 after a series of crashes at Forrest's Elbow. However, as the Winfield Racing Nissan team was part of a crash on Lap 144 at the section, the rules ordered a countback to the 143rd lap when the race was called to rain. The Nissan team was declared winner.\n\nThe MotoGP 2008 Red Bull Indianapolis Grand Prix was drastically affected by Hurricane Ike. The 250cc (now 600cc Moto2) class race was cancelled because of heavy rains, while earlier in the days the races in the 125cc (now 250cc Moto3) and MotoGP classes were curtailed because of weather.\n\nThe 2009 Petit Le Mans in Braselton, Georgia, was an example of a rainout under the FIA Code, where only three completed laps are needed for an official race and less than half the race (184 of 394 laps). The red flag waved after 184 laps at the 4:52 point of the race. In endurance racing, the clock does not stop for red flags. IMSA waited until 8 PM to declare the race official. While the race was 13 laps from official (500 miles), the clock had passed the five-hour mark when the race was called at 8 PM.\n\nAt Formula One's 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix, a rainstorm was predicted to hit the half of the race of 56 laps, however, at the start of the race the weather was sunny with large black clouds in the distance. By lap 19 it began to rain as some drivers entered pit road for wet tyres as the rain was falling hard. By lap 28, the rain was torrential to the point officials called a caution, deploying the Safety Car, but still several cars were out due to spins or crashes. The rain became worse and the race was red-flagged on lap 33. Once the rain had ceased, it was deemed too late and dark to continue and the race was stopped. Some drivers and spectators protested the race organizer's decision but no action was taken. The 2009 season was the first year that the FIA started the Asia and Australia races as late-afternoon starts where the sun would be setting during the race finish in order to maximise European television broadcasts.\n\nIn the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix of Formula One, rain before the race wet the circuit. 30 minutes into the race, a heavy rainstorm hit the circuit and the race was red-flagged. The rain didn't stop quickly and the event was delayed for more than 2 hours, but the full distance was eventually run and was the longest race in Formula One history. To prevent a repeat, FIA rules were changed so that a four-hour race clock starts when the cars start their warm-up lap. The clock will not be stopped for any situation, effectively ending a race four hours after cars roll off, regardless of how far the race has finished.\n\nThe 2012 Daytona 500 was postponed by rain for the first time in history, as it was postponed 30 hours from 1 PM Sunday to 7 PM Monday.\n\nThe 2013 6 Hours of Fuji in the FIA World Endurance Championship was effectively cancelled because of rain; officials started the clock and ran laps under caution, hoping for conditions to improve; after 17 laps, all under caution, the race was effectively cancelled, but under FIA rules, was an official race. To prevent a repeat, FIA rules were changed to state the three completed laps rule to make a race official applied only to green flag laps.\n\nThe 2015 Petit Le Mans was shortened to 7 hours, 51 minutes after being under one weather delay earlier in the race; after a safety car with slightly over two hours remaining, the race was abandoned after 179 laps because of weather conditions related to Hurricane Joaquin and related heavy rains in the Southeastern United States.\n\nIn cricket, when part of a game is rained out causing a reduction in the number of overs batted by one or both teams then the number of runs accredited to either one or both teams may be revised. A common method to recalculate the number of runs accredited to either team is the Duckworth–Lewis method.\n\nIn event of a rain delay, most television broadcasters run alternate programming (also known as \"rain delay filler\"), in place of the scheduled game or event. Depending on event, the alternate programming takes many forms, such as a movie, a rerun of a television program, interviews and analysis, highlights of the last event, or even another game or for networks such as ESPN and Fox Sports 1, \"whiparound\" coverage of other games from other regional sports networks (Fox Sports 1 also maintains a regularly scheduled program, \"MLB Whiparound\"). The delay continues until the weather is cleared up enough to resume the game, or if it comes to a point where it is not practical to resume it; in this case, it would become a \"rain out\".\n\nIn some cases, if the rain delay is in danger of interfering with the network's schedule that would follow after the game, they would often transfer coverage of the game to another station or channel, or show it later on via tape delay, depending on the organizational policy. For instance, with Sunday afternoon NASCAR events and Saturday night NHL games, a race on a broadcast network such as Fox or NBC would be moved to an alternate cable network such as Fox Sports 1 or NBCSN if the delay runs several hours, to allow those networks to present their prime time entertainment schedules (or, in NBC's case, its late night show \"Saturday Night Live\", which has been protected from sports-related delays since an incident with the XFL in 2001), or later in NASCAR's season with NBC, allows contingency as \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" takes full contractual precedence over NASCAR events.\n\n\"The Million Second Quiz\" was an example of a live broadcast of a game show that was filmed outdoors (it was filmed in an hourglass-shaped outdoor structure on top of a building with a flat roof). There was also an alternate indoor set where the non-primetime broadcasts took place. However, if inclement weather activity happened in the area where the show was filmed during primetime, the game show temporarily moved to its alternate set located inside the building. During the event, the clock did not stop for weather-related delays or other circumstances. The show was broadcast on NBC for only one season, after which it was canceled.\n\nThe 2011 NHL Winter Classic was scheduled to take place at 1 PM EST New Year's Day, but ended up delayed to 8 PM EST due to unusually warm weather in the Pittsburgh area, with rain impacting the game. Because the game was then moved to prime time, the game ended up having the unintended result of bringing in higher ratings for NBC in the United States, giving the NHL the highest ratings for a regular-season game since 1975. Despite this, subsequent Winter Classics remain played in the early afternoon hours, as the game is purposefully scheduled at that time to avoid the College Football Playoff bowl games, mainly the Rose Bowl Game and Sugar Bowl most years.\n\n"}

{"id": "3488996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3488996", "title": "Steal (basketball)", "text": "Steal (basketball)\n\nIn basketball, a steal occurs when a defensive player legally causes a turnover by his positive, aggressive action(s). This can be done by deflecting and controlling, or by catching the opponent's pass or dribble of an offensive player. The defender must not touch the offensive player's hands or otherwise a \"foul\" is called.\n\nSteals are credited to the defensive player who first causes the turnover, even if he does not end up with possession of the live ball. To earn a steal, the defensive player must be the initiator of the action causing the turnover, not just the benefactor. Whenever a steal is recorded by a defensive player, an offensive player must be credited as committing a turnover.\n\nStealing the ball requires good anticipation, speed and fast reflexes, all common traits of good defenders. However, like blocked shots, steals are not always a perfect gauge of a player's defensive abilities. An unsuccessful steal can result in the defender being out of position and unable to recover in time, allowing the offense to score. Therefore, attempting to steal is a gamble. Steals, though risky, can pay off greatly, because they often trigger a fastbreak for the defensive team.\n\nThere is no prototypical position from which a player may get many steals. While smaller, quicker guards tend to accumulate the most steals, there are many exceptions. For example, forward Rick Barry led the NBA in steals in 1974-75, and for many years center Hakeem Olajuwon led his team in the category, consistently ranking among the league's leaders, and is the only center ranked in the top 10 all-time in steals. Karl Malone, a power forward, is currently number ten.\n\nSteals were first recorded in the NBA in the 1973–74 season, while the rival ABA league first recorded steals during the same season.\n\nKendall Gill and Larry Kenon are tied for most steals in a regular season NBA game with eleven. Kenon's was recorded on December 26, 1976 while Gill recorded his on April 3, 1999.\n\nThe most steals by a player in an NBA season is 301 by Alvin Robertson in 1985-86.\n\nThe NBA's all-time leader for steals is John Stockton with 3,265 in his career.\n\nThe NBA leader in steals per game (SPG) is Robertson with an average of 2.71 (career, 1250 steals minimum) and 3.67 (season, 125 minimum).\n\nBaron Davis is the all-time playoff leader in steals per game for a career with 2.28 SPG.\n\nMaurice Cheeks in the 1979 Playoffs averaged a playoff record 4.11 SPG.\n\nSome of the greatest defensive specialists in the steals category in the NBA include:\n\n"}

The report involved Liam Collins, a British hurdler, going undercover in an attempt to obtain banned substances from Sly and other medical professionals. The report claimed that Manning's wife, Ashley, had been shipped off-label human growth hormone (HGH) by the Guyer Institute during the fall of 2011 while Manning was out with a severe neck injury, with the intention of hiding that Manning was the one actually receiving the drugs; as well as several other athletes been provided the banned hormone supplement Delta-2. Moreover, Sly spoke with great acknowledge about doping and tossed out several athletes like Howard, Zimmerman, Manning and fellow football players Mike Neal and Dustin Keller.\n\nSly said on a hidden camera record:\nMLB player Taylor Teagarden also claimed in an undercover footage included in the documentary:\nManning told ESPN's Lisa Salters about the reports, on an interview on the morning of the 27th for ESPN Sunday NFL Countdown: \n\nSalters pointed other cases have been seen in which athletes deny first and then eventually admit allegations and Manning answered he can't speak for others and he know how hard he worked. Nevertheless, Manning also stated he had visited the Guyer Institute 35 times during 2011 and that he had received both medication and treatment from Guyer during this time. Sly recanted his story and requested the report not to be aired via a YouTube video following the release of the report.\n\nManning took response and hired former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer to manage the issue. He also threatened to sue Al Jazeera but then backed up. Later, Fleischer confirmed that Ashley Manning did receive shipments from the Guyer Institute, but refused to confirm if the shipments had included HGH.\n\nMedia reactions were varied. Fox News' contributor Jesse Watters claimed on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" the PED allegations reported by Al Jazeera were a plot to go \"after American icons and US institutions,\" citing the allegations against Manning as the prime example. NBC News on \"Today\" gave Al Jazeera's reporter Deborah Davies space to specify details about the reports and provide Al Jazeera's version of the story. CNN's \"Reliable Sources\" with Brian Stelter reported Al Jazeera was in contact with a second source who confirmed that the clinic sent HGH to Ashley Manning in Florida and elsewhere, and according to Davies was “absolutely impeccably placed, knowledgeable and credible”. After Salters' interview with Manning, former NFL coach and ESPN pundit Mike Ditka expressed on the same Sunday NFL Countdown episode: “Al Jazeera is not a credible news organization. They’re out there spreading garbage.” \"Sports Illustrated\" sportswriter and \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" contributor Peter King called Al Jazeera on his column \"The MMQB\" a day later \"a quite credible and respected international news organization\" and \"the CNN of the Middle East spreading its news-gathering around the world in recent years\", and also contacted Davies to ask about information related to the Guyer Clinic and Sly. CBS sportscaster and \"NFL on CBS\" #1 Play-by-play commentator Jim Nantz refused to acknowledge the report while on the air, referring to it as a \"non-story\".\n\nAs part of the backlash, on January 5, 2016 it was announced that Howard and Zimmerman had filed a lawsuit suing Al Jazeera for defamation following the publication's release of the documentary which linked them. Also, Zimmerman's team, the Washington Nationals, issued a statement in support of their player.\n\nSly said he had never seen the Mannings and told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that he is not a pharmacist and was not at the Guyer Institute in 2011, as Al Jazeera claimed, but state licensing records indicate that someone named \"Charles David Sly\" was licensed as a pharmacy intern in Indiana from April 2010 to May 2013 and that his license expired May 1, 2013. Al Jazeera later confirmed that Sly had worked at the Guyer Institute during the Fall of 2011. Sly also claimed to ESPN that the reporter involved, Collins, had taken advantage of him during a vulnerable time in his life as Sly's fiancée had allegedly died, although Sly refers to his fiancée, \"Karen\", several times in the present tense during his conversations with Collins and gave no indication to Collins that she had died. Sly had also described one of the athletes mentioned, Mike Neal, as a good friend and told in the documentary he had spent about six weeks in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where Neal played; and while on Green Bay, Sly was introduced by Neal to several of his teammates, in a roster which has included players like Matthews III and Julius Peppers, both whom Sly mentioned on camera. Neal served a four-game suspension for doping in 2012. Furthermore, the owner of the Guyer Clinic, Dale Guyer, was linked to doubtful businesses in the past.\n\nSubsequently, \"The New York Times\" made the link between most of the names mentioned in the documentary and a sports therapy clinic called Performance Compound in Tampa, Florida run by Sly's partner Jason Riley, a fitness trainer based in Sarasota, Florida. Sly and Riley also launched \"Elementz Nutrition\", a nutritional supplement company whose website and Facebook page feature many of the athletes Sly referred. At the beginning of 2016 \"Elementz Nutrition\" voluntarily dissolved and closed its doors.\n\nOn February 5, 2016, two men visited Sly's parents, and according to a 911 call from Sly's parents' house during the visit, one of the men initially said he was a law enforcement officer, but didn’t have a badge. The two men later acknowledged that they weren't law enforcement officers and stated they were looking for Sly and not his parents. In response to the 911 call, the police went to the Sly house, but meanwhile, after the investigators identified themselves as private investigators, the parents decided to talk with them, and the police left.

Broncos quarterback John Elway, in a span of 5 minutes and 2 seconds, led his team 98 yards in 15 plays to tie the game with 37 seconds left in regulation. Denver won the game in overtime making a 38 yard field goal, the Broncos pulled off a 23–20 win over the Cleveland Browns. \n\nThe 98-yard drive ranks as pro football's prototypical clutch performance. Elway and his team spanned almost all of the 100-yard football field. According to an article by \"Sports Illustrated\" columnist and Colorado resident Rick Reilly, when Elway started the drive, Broncos offensive guard Keith Bishop said of the Browns, \"We got 'em right where we want 'em!\" Cleveland could not force a fourth down against Denver. The Cleveland Browns, along with lead rusher \"the captain\" Cory Chaney, ran for 659 yards.\n\nThe Browns had jumped to a 20–13 lead and Denver had muffed the ensuing kickoff when Elway took over, first-and-10 on their own 2-yard line, with 5:32 to play in regulation.\n\nTwo-minute warning\n\n\nThe Drive was featured in the movie \"Hot Tub Time Machine\", but due to the butterfly effect, Jackson was distracted by a squirrel and failed to catch the pass and Cleveland went on to win. It was inaccurately portrayed as being in 1986 (the game was played on January 11, 1987, though it was at the end of the 1986 NFL season). The movie implied that it was played at night; however, when Karlis kicked the winning field goal in OT, it was still daytime in Cleveland.\n\n"}

Touch judges also stand behind the posts to confirm that a goal has been scored following a penalty kick or conversion of a try. There are two touch judges, one for each touch-line and each holding a different coloured flag.\n\nRugby union touch judges support the referee by marking 'touch' (identifying when the ball leaves the playing area and comes into contact with something there or when the player carrying the ball steps out of the playing area), indicating successful kicks at goal and marking offside lines at set piece plays (the scrum and line out).\n\nDepending on the relevant national regulations, touch judges can be recognised as 'assistant referees' and can have the authority to indicate foul play, support with pre-match protocols and other roles delegated to them by the referee.\n\nIn England, touch judges are only recognised as assistant referees when appointed by the RFU or by the relevant Referees' Society. Touch judges in the vast majority of community matches do not act as assistant referees and cannot comment on matters of foul play or other technical matters.\n\nIn test matches, it is normal for the referee and assistant referees to be connected by a radio link to aid the communication of all this information.\n\nAt elite levels of the 'sevens' variation of rugby union, additional in-goal assistant referees exist to support the referee with in-goal decisions.\n\nIn rugby league, touch judges can communicate with the referee verbally or through a number of specific flag and hand signals. These indicate specific breaches of the laws, for example forward pass, knock on and penalty offences, how play should restart and whether the ball was grounded correctly for a try. As in rugby union, touch judges stand behind the posts to confirm success of a penalty kick or the conversion of a try. Touch judge and referee signals and duties in rugby league are laid out in the laws of the game. In some matches, additional officials are used solely to determine whether a try has been correctly grounded. These are known as \"in-goal\" officials.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10853062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10853062", "title": "U.S. Bank Stadium", "text": "U.S. Bank Stadium\n\nU.S. Bank Stadium is an enclosed stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. Built on the former site of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the indoor stadium opened in 2016 and is the home of the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL); it also hosts early season college baseball games of the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers (NCAA).\n\nThe Vikings played at the Metrodome from 1982 until its closure in 2013; during construction, the Vikings played two seasons (2014, 2015) at the open-air TCF Bank Stadium on the campus of the University of Minnesota. The team's first home was Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington now the site of the Mall of America.\n\nOn June 17, 2016, U.S. Bank Stadium was deemed substantially complete by contractor Mortenson Construction, six weeks before the ribbon-cutting ceremony and official grand opening on July 22. Authority to use and occupy the stadium was handed over to the Vikings and the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority. The Vikings played their first pre-season game at U.S. Bank Stadium on August 28; the home opener of the regular season was in week two against the Green Bay Packers on September 18, a 17–14 victory.\n\nIt is the first fixed-roof stadium built in the NFL since Ford Field in Detroit, which opened in 2002. As of March 2015, the overall budget was estimated to be $1.061 billion, with $348 million from the state of Minnesota, $150 million from the city of Minneapolis, and $551 million from the team and private contributions.\n\nU.S. Bank Stadium hosted Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018, the ESPN X Games on July 19–22, 2018, and is expected to host the 2019 NCAA Final Four, and the 2020 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships.\n\nWhile the Vikings' owners wanted an outdoor stadium, the state and local governments would only provide funding for an indoor stadium capable of hosting major events like the Super Bowl and the Final Four. A retractable roof, the trend in 2010s football stadiums, would have been too expensive.\n\nArchitecture firm HKS, Inc., also responsible for the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium and the Indianapolis Colts' Lucas Oil Stadium, decided to go for a lightweight translucent roof and glazed entrances with giant pivoting doors, aiming to get as much natural light from the outside as possible. The roof is made up of 60% Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), a fluorine-based clear plastic, and is the largest in North America, spanning supplied and installed by the firm Vector Foiltec. ETFE's low R-factor and the roof's slanted design, inspired by Nordic vernacular architecture, allows the stadium to endure heavy snow loads. Snow accumulates in areas that are more safely and easily accessible, and also moves down the slanted roof into a heated gutter, the water from which drains to the nearby Mississippi River.\n\nThe translucent roof and large wall panels also give fans a view of downtown Minneapolis. The glass operable wall panels will allow the stadium to experience some of the outdoor elements while providing protection from the snow, rain, and the cold winter weather. The stadium is aligned northwest and the elevation at street level is approximately above sea level.\n\nYears before construction began on the stadium, local and national conservation groups - including the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the Audubon Society - requested a \"bird-friendly\" design of the stadium's exterior using slightly less transparent bird-safe glass. Designers ignored the advice and instead used highly reflective glass for aesthetic reasons. The reflective glass, combined with the stadium lying along the Mississippi Flyway migration route, has resulted in a large number of bird deaths, double any other building in Minneapolis. A \"bird fatality study\" being financed by the Vikings and the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority is expected to be completed in 2019. If changes are made, it will now cost about $10 million to replace the existing glass with bird-safe glass rather than the $1 million it would have added to the original construction.\n\nThe design for U.S. Bank Stadium has been compared to the Crystal Cathedral in southern California, which was created by architect Philip Johnson. Opened in 1980, Crystal Cathedral was previously considered America's largest glass-dominated building. The stadium, which likewise sports transparent roofs, walls, and giant rotating doors, has the world's five largest pivoting doors.\n\nThe seating capacity is 66,860 for most games, slightly more than the Metrodome, and can be expanded to 73,000 for soccer, concerts, and special events, such as the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Vikings' lease with the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission (MSFC), as signed by both parties in August 1979, kept them in the Metrodome until 2011. The lease was considered one of the least lucrative among NFL teams; it included provisions where the commission owned the stadium, and the Vikings were locked into paying rent until the end of the 2011 season. For several years prior to the Metrodome's demolition, however, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission waived the team's nearly $4 million rent.<ref name=\"MinnPost11/17/2009\"></ref> The Vikings paid the MSFC 9.5% of their ticket sales; the commission \"reserve[d] all rights to sell or lease advertising in any part of the Stadium,\" the team could not use the scoreboard for any ads, and the team did not control naming rights for the building. Though the Vikings received revenue from the sale of luxury suites during the Minnesota Twins baseball season (a contributing factor to the Twins leaving the Metrodome for Target Field in 2010), the commission controlled the limited parking and its revenue and paid the team 10% of all concession sales while retaining roughly 35% of concessions sold during Vikings games. The Vikings were 30th out of 32 NFL teams in local revenues in 2005. The Vikings, as well as the stadium's other tenants, continually turned down any proposals for renovating the Metrodome itself. A plan for a joint Vikings/University of Minnesota football stadium was proposed in 2002, but differences over how the stadium would be designed and run, as well as state budget constraints, led to the plan's failure. The university would eventually open its own TCF Bank Stadium in 2009.\n\nFrom the outset, Zygi Wilf, a billionaire from New Jersey and principal owner of the Vikings since 2005, had stated he was interested in redeveloping the downtown site of the Metrodome no matter where the new facility was built. Taking into consideration downtown Minneapolis' growing mass transit network, cultural institutions, and growing condo and office markets, Wilf considered underdeveloped areas on Downtown's east side, centered on the Metrodome, to be a key opportunity and began discussing the matter with neighboring landholders, primarily the City of Minneapolis and the \"Star Tribune\". An unrelated 2008 study explains that the effect of the media, in this case an uncritical \"Star Tribune\", matters a great deal in helping a stadium initiative. As a result, once negotiations for a different location had been put aside, the Vikings focused on proposing a stadium that would be the centerpiece of a larger urban redevelopment project.\n\nWilf's Vikings began acquiring significant land holdings in the Downtown East neighborhood around the Metrodome. In June 2007, the Vikings acquired four blocks of mostly empty land surrounding the \"Star Tribune\" headquarters from Avista Capital Partners (the private equity owner of the \"Star Tribune\") for $45 million; it is also believed the Vikings have first right of refusal to later buy the paper's headquarters building. In May 2007, the Vikings also acquired three other downtown parking lots for a total of $5 million, and have made a bid for a city-owned, underground parking ramp next to the neighborhood's light rail station.\n\nOn April 19, 2007, the MSFC and the Vikings unveiled their initial plans for the stadium and surrounding urban area, with an estimated opening of 2012. The plan included substantial improvements to the surrounding area, including an improved light rail stop, 4,500 residential units, hotels with a combined 270 rooms, of office space and substantial retail space.\n\nAs of 2007, the stadium would have held approximately 73,600 people and was to have been complete by August 2011. The initial proposal did not have the final architectural design renderings, but did include key features that were to have been included in any final plan, including the plans for neighboring urban development. These included demands for a retractable roof, an open view of the surroundings (particularly the downtown skyline), a glass-enclosed Winter Garden alongside the already-existing adjacent Metrodome light-rail stop, leafy urban square with outdoor cafés and dense housing around its edges, aesthetic improvements to roads connecting the stadium to nearby cultural institutions, and adaptive reuse of neighboring historic buildings. The roof would have allowed Minneapolis to remain a potential venue for the Super Bowl and Final Four, both of which had been held at the Metrodome. The proposed urban plan itself was received with cautious welcome.\n\nThe 2007 proposed cost estimate for the downtown Minneapolis stadium was $953,916,000. The total broke down to $616,564,000 for the stadium, $200,729,000 for a retractable roof, $58,130,000 for parking, $8,892,000 for adjacent land right-of-way, and $69,601,000 to take into account inflation by 2010. The estimate compared to then-upcoming stadiums in Indianapolis at $675 million (retractable roof, completed 2008), Dallas at $932 million (retractable roof, completed 2009), and New York at $1.7 billion (open-air, completed in 2010). In addition, according to Wilf, taking into account the costs for the surrounding urban developments put forth in the proposal would have brought the estimated total to $2 billion. The estimated costs were based on projected 2008 construction and material costs, so it would have been possible that the stadium costs could have hovered near $1 billion if the Minnesota State Legislature had not approved the project in the 2008 session.\n\nNo proposals were made, at that time, for paying for the stadium. The MSFC and Vikings made initial pitches to the Minnesota State Legislature during the end of the 2007 session, but expected to make serious efforts during the 2008 legislative session. The Vikings proposed creating a Minnesota Football Stadium Task Force, which they expect would take 24 months to plan the stadium.\n\nFollowing the September 2008 MSFC vote to start feasibility studies for re-using the Metrodome, an unrelated study released for 38 U.S. cities found that \"when a [NFL] team wins, people's moods improve,\" and that personal income for residents of a city with an NFL team with 10 wins increases about $165 per year. While true for NFL football, for comparison, professional baseball and basketball gain no personal income for residents.\n\nFeasibility studies for Dallas-based design and local construction of a new stadium were expected in early 2009. Roy Terwilliger, a former Republican state senator from Edina, Ray Waldron, an AFL-CIO leader, and the Dome engineering expert and CEO, Bill Lester and Steve Maki of the MSFC selected architectural firm HKS of Dallas and construction manager Mortenson of Minnesota over the objections of Paul Thatcher and Timothy Rose of Minneapolis-St. Paul, who preferred Ellerbe Beckett and Kraus-Anderson, both of Minnesota. Loanne Thrane of St. Paul, the sole female member of the commission, voiced opposition and later voted with the majority.\n\nIn December 2009, commission chairman Terwilliger said, \"We know what the art of the possible is at this particular location.\" A new proposal for 65,000 seats with a sliding roof was unveiled at 84 million less than the previous proposal, but with 50 million per year more scheduled for each year that construction is delayed. Vikings officials boycotted the presentation which estimated the total cost at 870 million, or 770 million if the sliding roof were omitted.\n\nThe 2010 Vikings stadium proposal was dealt a setback on May 5, 2010, when a Minnesota House panel defeated the proposal by a 10–9 vote.\n\nThe stadium debate was revived in the aftermath of the Metrodome's roof deflation on December 12, 2010, which forced the relocation of the Vikings' final two home games of the 2010 season and led to more calls for a new stadium from various sources in the local and national media. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton discussed the matter with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, but said \"any new stadium must first benefit the people of Minnesota\".\n\nAfter Hennepin County stopped their pursuit of a Vikings stadium, the city of Minneapolis submitted a plan for a Vikings' stadium at the downtown Metrodome site. The Minneapolis plan was for a fixed-roof stadium costing an estimated $895 million. The proposal also included funding solutions for $95 million in renovations to the Target Center. The team reacted with skepticism to the proposal and did not want to play at nearby 50,000-seat capacity University of Minnesota TCF Bank Stadium during the three years of construction. Because the Minneapolis dome site was a less expensive option, football fans were expected to return to the Minneapolis plan if the shortfall in the Ramsey County plan were not realized.\n\nIn May 2011, Ramsey County officials announced they had reached an agreement with the Minnesota Vikings to be the team’s local partner for a new stadium, subject to approval by the Minnesota Legislature and to approval of a sales tax by the Ramsey County Board. The site of the stadium would be the former Twin Cities Army Ammunitions Plant in Arden Hills, which is about 10 miles from the Metrodome in Minneapolis and is a Superfund clean up site. The agreement called for an $884 million stadium and an additional $173 million for on-site infrastructure, parking and environmental costs.\n\nRamsey County said the Vikings would commit $407 million to the project, which would have been about 44% of the stadium cost and 39% of the overall cost. The county's cost would have been $350 million, to be financed by a half-cent sales tax increase. The state of Minnesota's cost would have been $300 million. This totalled about $1.057 billion, leaving at least a $131 million shortfall.\n\nOn March 1, 2012, Governor Dayton announced an agreement for a new stadium to be built on the site of the Metrodome, pending approval by the state legislature and the Minneapolis city council. The $975 million project, half of which would be publicly funded, would be patterned after Lucas Oil Stadium. It would utilize part of the footprint of the Metrodome and would only require the Vikings to play at TCF Bank Stadium during the final year of construction. The agreement met with mixed reaction, and some criticized the proposal as being unfair to taxpayers and a giveaway to team owners.\n\nOn May 10, 2012, the Minnesota Legislature approved funding for a new Vikings stadium on that site. The project is projected to have a $975 million price tag, with the Vikings covering $477 million, the state covering $348 million, and $150 million covered by a hospitality tax in Minneapolis. The city of Minneapolis must pay a total of 678 million over the 30-year life of the deal, including interest, operations, and construction costs. The bill was signed by Gov. Dayton and received the approval of the Minneapolis City Council on May 25, 2012. The Vikings played in the Metrodome through the 2013 season, as construction did not require the dome's immediate demolition. Under the leadership of Vikings COO Kevin Warren, the team moved to TCF Bank Stadium on the University of Minnesota campus until the new stadium is complete.\n\nOn May 13, 2013, the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority (MSFA), the Minnesota Vikings, and HKS Sports & Entertainment Group together unveiled the new stadium's design.\n\nIn January 2014, a lawsuit was started by former Minneapolis mayoral candidate Doug Mann and two others to block the construction of the new stadium. The suit questioned the constitutionality of the stadium's funding plan and delayed a $468 million bond sale. Officials warned the delay could stall the project's timeline and add costs. The lawsuit was later dismissed by the Minnesota Supreme Court.\n\nThe State of Minnesota's portion of the cost of the stadium was to be funded by revenue from a proposed new charitable gambling source, which was dubbed electronic pulltabs. When the stadium funding bill was passed in the legislature and signed by the governor on May 14, 2012, the new revenue from the games was estimated to be $34 million for 2013, and rising each year thereafter.\n\nSix months later, the first budget estimate from the Minnesota Office of Management and Budget was released, revising the projected revenue from the electronic pulltab games. This first revision cut the estimated revenue from the game for 2013 by 51%, to $16 million (versus the legislation's estimate of $34 million).\n\nFrom page 15 of the Minnesota Management and Budget Complete Forecast, November 2012: \"For FY 2013, the projected reserve balance has been reduced from $34 to $16 million. Projected new gambling revenues from stadium legislation are expected to be $18 million (51%) below end of session estimates.\" \"The forecast reduction reflects a slower than expected implementation of electronic gaming options and reduced estimates for daily revenue per gaming device.\"\n\nIn March 2013, the Minnesota Office of Management and Budget released another updated budget forecast for fiscal years 2013 to 2017. Included in this forecast was another revision in the projected revenue from charitable gambling sources, from the previous estimate of $16 million, down to $1.7 million, a further 90% reduction in the estimate for 2013 revenue. This total was a 95% reduction from what was estimated in the stadium bill passed in May 2012.\n\nFrom page 12 of the Minnesota Management and Budget Complete Forecast, February 2013: \"The forecast for lawful gambling revenue has been reduced $15 million in FY 2013 and $46 million in FY 2014–15. Slower than expected implementation of electronic gambling options and a reduction in estimates for daily revenue per gambling location were the reasons for the revenue reduction\".\n\nAs a result of the projected shortfall, members of the Minnesota Legislature and the Governor's office began discussing ideas to fix the shortfall. The legislature decided to impose an inventory tax on cigarettes to make up for any shortfall over the next year of construction and closing of a corporate income-tax loophole for the following years.\n\nThe state reported in July 2016 that pulltab revenue is \"soaring\" and that there is optimism in Minneapolis about its continuing to rise.\n\nIn August 2012, the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority (MSFA)—the stadium's newly created owner—received bids and plans from five architectural and engineering firms, all nationally recognized stadium designers, including Populous, AECOM, EwingCole, and HNTB. On September 28, 2012, the MSFA selected the Dallas firm of HKS, Inc., which had designed both AT&T Stadium and Lucas Oil Stadium within the previous decade, to serve as the project's architect. HKS also designed Globe Life Park in Arlington, home of the Texas Rangers; the Milwaukee Brewers’ Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and renovations to the Chicago White Sox’s Guaranteed Rate Field. Initial design plans were not immediately released to the public, but Viking officials said they hoped the budget would allow the new stadium to include a retractable roof, walls, or windows. The design team also planned to incorporate interactive technology into some elements to create a more engaging fan experience.\n\nConstruction of the facility was originally slated to begin in October 2013, but was delayed until December 3, 2013, as an ongoing investigation of the Wilfs' finances continued to take place after a 21-year lawsuit against them came to a conclusion in late August. On August 27, 2015, one worker died and another was injured after falling during construction on the U.S. Bank Stadium roof. Jeramie M. Gruber, 35, of Northfield and the other injured worker were employed by St. Paul-based Berwald Roofing Co. which had been cited 6 times since 2010 for OSHA violations regarding improper fall protection for workers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigated the incident. As a result of the investigation, contractor Mortenson Construction and subcontractor Berwald Roofing faced fines of $173,400 for \"serious\" and \"willful\" safety violations. The reports do not provide an explanation of the accidents, but the largest fine, $70,000, and most serious alleged violation faults Berwald for willfully failing to have workers use proper fall protection while working at heights above 6 feet.\n\nOn June 15, 2015, the Vikings announced that U.S. Bank had acquired the naming rights to the stadium. The naming deal is worth $220 million over 25 years.\n\nOn May 20, 2014, the NFL awarded Minneapolis Super Bowl LII, beating out bids by Indianapolis and New Orleans for the game. On November 14, 2014, the NCAA announced the stadium will host the men's basketball Final Four in 2019. In May 2015, Governor Mark Dayton announced a bid to host the College Football Playoff National Championship in 2020. However, on November 4, 2015, it was announced that the game was awarded to New Orleans. This was the first losing bid for a major sporting event offered to be held at the stadium. On July 20, 2016, it was announced that U.S. Bank Stadium and Minneapolis would host the 2017 and 2018 summer X Games.\n\nThe first NFL game at the stadium was the Week 3 preseason game against the San Diego Chargers on August 28, 2016. Although the Vikings scored first with a field goal, the Chargers scored the first touchdown in the new stadium. The Vikings ultimately won, 23–10.\n\nThe first NFL regular season win at the stadium was on September 18, 2016 by the Vikings against the Green Bay Packers by a score of 17-14.\n\nThe AMA Motocross Championship hosts a round at U.S. Bank Stadium since 2017. The Metrodome had last hosted an AMA Supercross round in 2013.\n\nU.S. Bank Stadium hosted its first playoff game, an NFC divisional game, on January 14, 2018, as the Vikings hosted the New Orleans Saints. The Vikings won the game 29-24 on a last second 61-yard catch by wide receiver Stefon Diggs, in a play that became known as the Minneapolis Miracle. The Vikings then advanced to the NFC Championship game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia’s Lincoln Financial Field, where the Vikings lost 38-7, costing the Vikings the chance to become the first NFL team to play a Super Bowl in its own home stadium.\n\nSuper Bowl LII was played at the stadium on February 4, 2018 between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots with the Eagles winning 41-33 for their first Super Bowl win.\n\nThe Vikings said the design includes a soccer field measuring 115 by 74 yards to accommodate a potential Major League Soccer expansion team. In 2012, the Vikings received a five-year window to host a Major League Soccer team in the state's legislation to finance the stadium, and the Vikings ownership launched a bid to own an expansion franchise. In December 2014, Vikings Vice President Lester Bagley presented rendering of the stadium configured for a potential Major League Soccer team, with tarps and curtains covering the upper deck to bring the capacity down to 20,000. He said the stadium was \"being built specifically with soccer in mind\" and drew a contrast with Gillette Stadium, New England Revolution's home field, which he called \"a football stadium\".\n\nOn March 16, 2015, the Vikings announced they ended their expansion bid after MLS informed them that they preferred the bid by Minnesota United with its own plan for a smaller, outdoor stadium in Saint Paul.\n\nThe first soccer match at U.S. Bank Stadium was between AC Milan and Chelsea FC on August 3, 2016, as part of the 2016 International Champions Cup.\n\nIn 2021 the ECLA youth gathering will be held in the U.S. bank stadium from June 29 to July 3rd\n\nAs with the Metrodome, the new stadium will have the capability to host baseball games in the winter months. The University of Minnesota will play selected games, primarily during February and March, including hosting the Dairy Queen Classic, a non-conference series of games featuring top NCAA teams in Minnesota that was suspended during stadium construction.\n\nThe stadium's first baseball game was between Century College and Iowa Central on February 24, 2017. The University of Minnesota were scheduled to play the first baseball game at the new stadium, but converting it from Supercross to baseball took stadium officials longer than projected. Minnesota ended up playing Seattle University later on that same day as the third game at the stadium, first indoor home game for the university since the Metrodome.\n\nAs part of the opening weekend festivities for the stadium, two concerts were held: country artist Luke Bryan on August 19, 2016, and heavy metal band Metallica performing the following night, August 20. Prince, a Minneapolis native, was in preliminary talks to perform the first concert at the new stadium in August 2016, but he died on April 21.\n\n"}

However, they lost two difficult matches against eventual medal winners to close out the round robin, and fell one loss short of a medal round spot.\n\n\n\nVenezuela sent a thirteen-person swimming team to compete in eighteen events in Beijing. In the pool, only two progressed to a semifinal, and none made a final.

Dalia Contreras won her first two matches to make the semifinals in the women's under 49 kg division, where she lost a tied match on a judges decision. Still, her semifinals appearance allowed her to progress directly to the bronze medal match, where she beat a Kenyan opponent to claim Venezuela's only medal of the 2008 Games.

The next best finish came from Israel José Rubio in the men's 69 kg division, where he finished 13th. Three of the seven Venezuelan lifters did not complete a valid lift in one of the portions of the competition, and thus did not finish with a legal total.\n\nThe three Venezuelan wrestlers combined for a record of 0-4, with Luis Vivénez qualifying for the repechage, but losing his match to a Cuban athlete.\n\n\nList of qualified athletes (Spanish)\n"}

{"id": "37515451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37515451", "title": "Yulman Stadium", "text": "Yulman Stadium\n\nYulman Stadium is the on-campus venue for football at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. It currently has a capacity of 30,000 spectators, with 4,500 premium seats in two fan clubs - the Westfeldt Terrace and the Jill H. and Avram A. Glazer Family Club. The stadium's first game and grand opening was the 2014 season's home opener against its former Southern and Southeastern Conference foe Georgia Tech on September 6, 2014.\n\nYulman replaced the Mercedes-Benz Superdome as the home stadium of Tulane Green Wave football after 39 seasons at that venue, and it is situated on the university's Uptown campus between the Tulane baseball team's Turchin Stadium and the former site of Tulane's last on-campus football stadium, Tulane Stadium. As of the 2017 season, the Green Wave are 10-14 all-time in games played in Yulman.\n\nThe stadium features two elevated club decks on the home side. The Jill H. and Avram A. Glazer Family Club is the premier club-level seating in the stadium, with 1,500 chair back seats, two club rooms, two bars, expanded concessions, and a large meeting space. The remainder of Yulman's premium seating is composed of 3,000 chair back seats in the Westfeldt Terrace, located directly above the Glazer Club and covered by a canopy. Westfeldt features a panoramic view of the New Orleans skyline and premium concessions, including traditional New Orleans dishes.\n\nA large-scale meeting space is located on the ground level for use year-round. The entry space in front of the stadium, known as the Athletes Plaza, is used for pre- and post-game activities. The field's end zones feature a green and white checkerboard pattern such as that in the original Tulane Stadium, as well as an alternating green pattern made to look similar to real, mown grass. Yulman holds a 94-by-24-foot LED video board, as well as two ribbon displays, all made by Daktronics. Barry Kern from Mardi Gras World created a float for use during pre-game parades, as well as a mural inside the Glazer Club.\n\nYulman was designed and constructed with the ability to expand in the future should demand dictate it, specifically with 5,000—10,000 seats in the east sideline and north end zone (Glazer/Westfeldt side and Wilson end zone, respectively).\n\nPrior to the 2016 season, Athletic Director Troy Dannen announced the addition of a 2,400-pound sculpture of the program's classic \"Angry Wave\" to the top of the scoreboard. Installed during the 2017 season and located above the student section and produced by Mardi Gras World, the sculpture doubles as a water feature, though details of that aspect were not announced. The Angry Wave—made of fiberglass and steel—weighs 3,353 pounds and is 14 feet, 7 inches tall and 20 feet, 9 inches wide.\n\nFor some time, Tulane fans had felt chagrin at playing games at the Superdome. The stadium seated over 75,000 people for football, but in most cases, Green Wave football games were swallowed up by the environment.\n\nUniversity representatives initially named the stadium \"Tulane Community Stadium\" but revealed its official name in late 2012. Richard Yulman, the former chair/owner of Serta and a member of the Board of Tulane, and his wife donated $15 million toward construction of the project, gaining naming rights to the stadium in the process. He later committed another $10 million to the project as a challenge to other donors to completely fund the project through private donations by the end of the first football season in the stadium. The stadium’s playing surface was named Benson Field after New Orleans Saints and New Orleans Pelicans owner Tom Benson and his wife Gayle, who jointly donated $7.5 million from the Gayle and Tom Benson Charitable Foundation.\nIn its first game in Yulman Stadium, Tulane played the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in front of a university-reported crowd of 30,000 spectators. The opening game sold out 14 minutes after single-game tickets went on sale, and students picked up roughly 5,000 tickets for the game (about 40% of the entire undergraduate and graduate enrollment of the university), making it the largest student crowd at a Tulane game since football moved off campus in 1975.\n\nYulman Stadium hosted its first high school football game on September 8, 2017 when New Orleans Catholic schools De La Salle and St. Augustine played. It was the first prep contest on the Tulane campus since November 3, 1979, when Chalmette defeated Jesuit 23–9 at Tulane Stadium.\n\n"}
