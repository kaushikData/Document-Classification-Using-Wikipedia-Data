{"id": "9422233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9422233", "title": "2000s in video gaming", "text": "2000s in video gaming\n\nThe 2000s in video gaming was a decade that was primarily dominated by Sony, Nintendo, the newcomer Microsoft, and their respective systems. Sega, being Nintendo's main rival in the 1980s and 1990s, left the console market in 2002 in favor of returning to the third party company they once were. Overall the decade saw the last of the low resolution three-dimensional polygons of the 1990s with the emergence of High Definition games, and often focused on developing immersive and interactive environments, implementing realistic physics, and improving artificial intelligence.\n\nThe sixth generation of video games officially began in with the introduction of the short-lived Dreamcast, which was discontinued in . Sega announced that they would no longer produce video game consoles after two straight underperforming consoles and became a third-party developer. The PlayStation 2 was released in and became the best-selling video game console of all time. Microsoft entered the home console market with the Xbox. Although initially expected to struggle, it vaulted into a solid second place behind the PS2 on the strength of the launch title \"\". The Nintendo GameCube, launched in 2001 alongside the Xbox, fell into third place, a first for Nintendo.\n\nThe sixth generation improved on the 3D graphics of the fifth generation consoles as an era of many sixth generation games. Some of the new features in the consoles included built-in DVD players and hard drives. Internet play on consoles, pioneered by the Dreamcast, became commercially viable with the Xbox Live system, which was launched in November 2002, one year after the console's release. It featured a broadband connection and downloadable content and was a major success.\n\nThe seventh generation of consoles began with the release of the Xbox 360 in . This was followed by the Wii and the PlayStation 3 in . The seventh-generation featured widespread implementation of HD-ready graphics, media centers, and wireless game controllers, as well as complete online service for all consoles. The PS3 also has Blu-ray Disc compatibility. The Wii implemented an innovative game controller that features full motion sensitivity and is wielded like a remote, with limited button interaction. In response, the PS3 features tilt-sensitive functionality with its controllers. The Wii's motion sensitive controls and focus on family-friendly games, while alienating some hardcore gamers, helped the Wii to become the best-selling console of the seventh-generation. The high price of the PS3 had initially caused slow sales, but numerous price cuts and efforts to bring feature-parity between it and Xbox 360 were made in the years following. It was generally successful as the PlayStation 3 steadily increased in popularity, resulting in lifetime sales to be nearly equal to that of the Xbox 360.\n\nNintendo continued to dominate the handheld console market with the release of the dual-screen Nintendo DS in 2004. One of the screens is a touchscreen. The PlayStation Portable, released in 2005 by Sony, was the first serious competitor to Nintendo's handheld gaming consoles and is by far the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld.\n\nEarly on in the decade, the gaming world was shaken up over two major stories that dominated the headlines: Sega was pulling out of the console war and that Microsoft was entering the market. Sega stated that the poor performance of the Sega Dreamcast and Sega Saturn lines contributed to their decision. The company returned to third party publishing for the remaining consoles. Microsoft officially debuted their Xbox console at the Game Developers Conference in 2000 after much speculation.\n\nAfter the release of the Xbox and PlayStation 2, a noticeable trend was to push gaming consoles into media centers and offer more features than just playing games. Nintendo was slow to react and released the Gamecube in 2001 without many of the exotic features seen in other consoles. Instead, Nintendo was focusing on improving the gameplay experience, as well as preparing its new innovative controller to be released in 2006. Backward compatibility also became a staple feature to gaming in this decade. The PlayStation 2 was the first major system to allow for backward compatibility to a preceding console.\n\nCopyright infringement became a big concern to game developers and many companies tried experimenting with ways to combat the growing problem, especially among PC games. Some companies required registration through the use of a product key. In one of the more notable events of the decade, Valve was hit particularly hard by a hacker and subsequently had much of their work on \"Half-Life 2\" leaked onto the internet.\n\nSony and Microsoft released their PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in the mid-decade. As the decade progressed, more and more features were added to consoles. Internet connectivity became ubiquitous and some games integrated the use of webcam accessories. In the mid-decade, the industry was caught in the crossfire of the HD DVD and Blu-ray format war. Ultimately, the Blu-ray format won out, but that didn't help Microsoft after they have already made HD DVD compatibility a feature. Nintendo had still yet to release a system compatible for viewing films. Instead, Nintendo unveiled the Wii and revolutionized the industry with the interactive gameplay that its brand new controller provided. It would not be until the next decade that Sony or Microsoft would release a similar motion controller to the Wii as an accessory (\"See: Kinect and PlayStation Move\").\n\nThe 1990s decade oversaw the transition from 2D-based gaming to fully immersive three-dimensional environments and gameplay. The 2000s continued on this trend by polishing many of the flaws of creating a new dimension for games such as rigid polygon characters and animations. By the decades end, Microsoft and Sony had already been releasing games in high definition.\n\nPC gaming remained popular throughout the decade, but was in an overall decline as consoles became more and more popular. Publishers also liked the standardization that consoles provided, whereas PC game performance was dependent on the graphic capabilities of a player's hardware. Nevertheless, the PC remained the device of choice for many popular strategy, simulation, and online games.\n\nBlizzard was a company in the spotlight on numerous occasions throughout the 2000s and loyal to the PC. In 2000, it released the hack and slash game \"Diablo II\" which is frequently listed as one of the best games ever made. The game continues to have a wide following many years after its release and was listed on NPD Group's top ten PC games sales list as recently as 2010. Then in 2004, Blizzard wowed gamers with the release of \"World of Warcraft\", which was the world's most-subscribed MMORPG at the time with over 10 million subscribers.\n\n\"The Sims\", a spin-off project of the popular \"Sim City\" franchise, also became a popular game of the era. Combining all of its sequels and expansions, \"The Sims\" easily becomes one of the best-selling PC game in history. \"The Sims\" also had an important role in bringing female and casual gamers into the often male-dominated and hardcore gaming market.\n\nRhythm-gaming was primarily centered in the arcade with popular games such as \"Dance Dance Revolution\" and \"Beatmania\". Many of these franchises have been popular since the late-nineties, but it wasn't until \"Guitar Hero\"s release in 2005 that the genre really affected popular culture. Most games in this category will feature a set list of songs that a player can choose to perform. They also tend to come with a unique controller, usually shaped like a musical instrument. The success of Guitar Hero lead to the creation of other similar game franchises such as \"Rock Band\" and \"DJ Hero\". Coincidentally, the game has been cited as inspiration for people seeking to actually play instruments and has led to a revival of interest in classic rock nostalgia.\n\nIn retrospect, it appears that rhythm gaming was a fad. In late 2011, due to low sale figures, Activision closed its \"Guitar Hero\" division.\n\nSince 2007, the fast growing mobile market in African countries such as Nigeria and Kenya has resulted in a growth in mobile game development. Local developers have taken advantage of the recent increase in mobile internet connection in countries where broadband is rarely available and console games are expensive, though locally developed applications have difficulty competing against millions of western applications available on the Google Play Store. This growth has continued through the 2010s as gaming is becoming a more viable business.\n\nAs video games approached greater realism in their graphic capabilities, it was inevitable that controversy would result. The evidence was inconclusive, but debates continued throughout the decade about the level of profanity, violence, pornography, and whether or not video games had an addictive effect. One game series in particular that was no stranger to controversy in the 2000s was \"Grand Theft Auto\". In the 2004 \"\" installment of the series, the game received widespread criticism revolving around the Hot Coffee mod, a normally disabled mini-game that could be enabled. The drama and pressure forced the ESRB to re-rate the game as an AO (Adults Only) and to have it pulled from store shelves. The game was also criticized for being excessively violent.\nAnother game that struck a nerve with many analysts and the general public was a game released in 2005 entitled \"Super Columbine Massacre RPG!\" in which a player actually carries out the events of the 1999 Columbine high school shooting. The game and its creator, Danny Ledonne, was both praised for the bold statement on free speech and criticized for being distasteful. It became the first finalist to ever be rejected at the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival's Guerrilla Games Competition. In protest of the rejection, many of the finalists withdrew from the competition and in the end no awards were handed out that year. The competition has not been held since the 2007 incident.\n\nAs video games diversified and became an ever-present part of pop culture, its influence began integrating with other media. The film industry in particular took notice and capitalized on how they could integrate gaming into their storytelling. The Wachowskis, known for their Matrix series of films, developed \"Enter the Matrix\" to tie together the events of \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\" motion pictures. Making films from video games is nothing new to Hollywood, but the transition from video game to film doesn't always succeed. The 2000s however began to show promise in the profitability and success of making video game-based films.Opening in 2001, \"\" became the highest-grossing video game adaptation with over a US$274 million box office performance. \"Tomb Raider\" held that title for nearly a decade. Other adaptations in the 2000s included the popular \"Resident Evil\" saga, \"Silent Hill\", \"Max Payne\", \"Hitman\", \"Alone in the Dark\", \"DOOM\", \"House of the Dead\", and \"\".\n\nThe 2000s was also the first decade that the medium has significantly affected classical music. Tommy Tallarico and Jack Wall had a vision that a concert would be a way to show \"how culturally significant video games and video game music is in the world today.\" The first Video Games Live concert was held at the Hollywood Bowl on July 6, 2005 to an audience of 11,000 people. Many of the events feature a live orchestra, synchronized lighting and effects, and gameplay projected onto a screen.\n\nNotes:\n\n\nThe following chart describes the best-selling video games of the 2000s in physical form. Downloaded content may not be included into figures, however it should be noted that the \"Angry Birds\" game released in late-2009 had reached over 1 Billion downloads by 2012.\n"}

The hybrid rating is a compilation of the Matrix-Performance and Matrix-Elo ratings. The Performance rating uses location and point margin to rate teams, and the Elo rating uses location and win/loss outcome. Variations of these ratings also adjust for luck (an exceptional number of turnovers, field goal successes or failures, etc.), how well a team matches up against its opponents, and allow a team's performance to trend over time. \n\nBoth ratings are based on a probabilistic iterative-fitting model. In the Performance rating, point margins are converted into probabilities based on the standard deviation of a team's performance from its \"mean\". In this case, a probabilistic model gives greater weight to points score in close games. For the Elo rating, probabilistic outcomes of one and zero are assigned to wins and losses, respectively. An iterative method has the distinct advantage when dealing with only wins and losses that a best fit short of infinity can be found for undefeated and winless teams. The Matrix-Elo was inspired by the Chess Elo rating system. \n\n"}
{"id": "2512925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2512925", "title": "America (yacht)", "text": "America (yacht)\n\nAmerica was a 19th-century racing yacht and first winner of the America's Cup international sailing trophy.\n\nOn August 22, 1851, \"America\" won the Royal Yacht Squadron's regatta around the Isle of Wight by 18 minutes. The Squadron's \"One Hundred Sovereign Cup\" or \"£100 Cup\", mistakenly known in America as the \"One Hundred Guinea Cup,\" was later renamed after the original winning yacht.\n\nA syndicate of New York Yacht Club members, headed by NYYC charter member Commodore John Cox Stevens, with members Edwin A. Stevens, George Schuyler, Hamilton Wilkes, and J. Beekman Finley, would build a yacht to sail to England. The purpose of this visit was twofold: to show off U.S. shipbuilding skill and make money through competing in yachting regattas. Stevens employed the services of the shipyard of William Brown and his chief designer, George Steers.\n\n\"America\" was designed by James Rich Steers and George Steers (1820–1856) (See George Steers and Co). Traditional \"cod-head-and-mackerel-tail\" design gave boats a blunt bow and a sharp stern with the widest point (the beam) placed one-third of the length aft of the bow. George Steers' pilot boat designs, however, had a concave clipper-bow with the beam of the vessel at midships. As a result, his schooner-rigged pilot boats were among the fastest and most seaworthy of their day. They had to be seaworthy, for they met inbound and outbound vessels in any kind of weather. These vessels also had to be fast, for harbor pilots competed with each other for business. In addition to pilot boats, Steers designed and built 17 yachts, some which were favourites with the New York Yacht Club.\n\n\"America\" was captained by Richard Brown, who was also a skilled member of the Sandy Hook Pilots group, renowned worldwide for their expertise in manoeuvering the shoals around New York Harbor. They were highly skilled racers as a result of impromptu races between pilots to ships in need of pilot services. Brown had sailed aboard a pilot boat designed by George Steers, of whom he was a personal friend. He chose as first mate Nelson Comstock, a newcomer to yacht racing.\n\nCrewed by Brown and eight professional sailors, with George Steers, his older brother James, and James' son George as passengers, \"America\" left New York on June 21, 1851 and arrived at Le Havre on July 11. They were joined there by Commodore Stevens. After drydocking and repainting \"America\" left for Cowes, Isle of Wight, on July 30. While there the crew enjoyed the hospitality of the Royal Yacht Squadron while Stevens searched for someone who would race against his yacht.\n\nThe British yachting community had been following the construction of \"America\" with interest and perhaps some trepidation. When \"America\" showed up on the Solent on July 31 there was one yacht, \"Laverock\", that appeared for an impromptu race. The accounts of the race are contradictory: a British newspaper said \"Laverock\" held her own, but Stevens later reported that \"America\" beat her handily. Whatever the outcome, it seemed to have discouraged other British yachtsmen from challenging \"America\" to a match. She never raced until the last day of the Royal Yacht Squadron's annual members-only regatta for which Queen Victoria customarily donated the prize. Because of \"America\"s presence, a special provision was made to \"open to all nations\" a race of 'round the Isle of Wight, with no reservation for time allowance.\n\nThe race was held on August 22, 1851, with a 10:00 AM start for a line of seven schooners and another line of eight cutters. \"America\" had a slow start due to a fouled anchor and was well behind when she finally got under way. Within half an hour however, she was in 5th place and gaining.\n\nThe eastern shoals of the Isle of Wight are called the Nab Rocks. Traditionally, races would sail around the east (seaward) side of the lightship that marked the edge of the shoal, but one could sail between the lightship and the mainland if they had a knowledgeable pilot. \"America\" had such a pilot and he took her down the west (landward) side of the lightship. After the race a contestant protested this action, but was overruled because the official race rules did not specify on which side of the lightship a boat had to pass.\n\nThis tactic put \"America\" in the lead, which she held throughout the rest of the race. At one point the jib boom broke due to a crew error, but it was replaced in fifteen minutes. On the final leg of the race the yacht \"Aurora\" closed but was 18 minutes behind when \"America\" finished shortly after 6:00 PM. Legend has it that while watching the race, Queen Victoria asked who was second, and received the famous reply: \"There is no second, your Majesty.\"\n\nJohn Cox Stevens and the syndicate from the New York Yacht Club owned the \"America\" from the time she was launched on May 3, 1851 until ten days after she won the regatta that made her famous.\n\nOn September 1, 1851, the yacht was sold to John de Blaquiere, 2nd Baron de Blaquiere, who raced her only a few times before selling her in 1856 to Henry Montagu Upton, 2nd Viscount Templetown, who renamed the yacht \"Camilla\" but failed to use or maintain her. In 1858, she was sold to Henry Sotheby Pitcher.\n\nPitcher, a shipbuilder in Northfleet, Kent, rebuilt \"Camilla\" and resold her in 1860 to Henry Edward Decie, who brought her back to the United States. Decie sold the ship to the Confederate States of America the same year for use as a blockade runner in the American Civil War. Decie remained aboard as captain. During this time she may have been renamed \"Memphis\" but the details are unclear. In 1862, she was scuttled in Dunns Creek, north of Crescent City, when Union troops took the city of Jacksonville.\n\nShe was raised, repaired and renamed \"America\" by the Union, and served the United States Navy on the blockade for the remainder of the war. \"America\" was armed with three smooth bore bronze cannon designed by John A. Dahlgren and cast at the Washington Navy Yard. A 12-pounder was located on the bow and two 24-pounders were placed amidships. Each 24-pounder weighed and had a range of at an elevation of four degrees.\n\nAssigned to the federal blockading squadron off Charleston, South Carolina, she was on patrol the night of 19 March 1863, when she spotted the smoke of a blockade runner near Dewees Inlet, South Carolina. She immediately launched colored signal flares to alert the rest of the fleet. The runner proved to be the CSS \"Georgiana\", which was described in contemporary documents as the most powerful Confederate cruiser then afloat. \"America's\" action ultimately resulted in the \"Georgiana\"s wreck and destruction. \"Georgiana\" was undoubtedly the most important vessel to be captured or destroyed by the federal blockade.\n\nAfter the war, \"America\" was used as a training ship at the U. S. Naval Academy. On August 8, 1870, \"America\" was entered by the Navy in the America's Cup race at New York Harbor, where she finished fourth.\n\n\"America\" remained in the U.S. Navy until 1873, when she was sold to Benjamin Butler for US$5,000. Butler raced and maintained the boat well, commissioning a rebuild by Donald McKay in 1875 and a total refit of the rig in 1885 by Edward Burgess to keep her competitive. Upon Butler's death in 1893, his son Paul inherited the schooner, but had no interest in her, and so gave her to his nephew Butler Ames in 1897. Ames reconditioned \"America\" and used her occasionally for racing and casual sailing until 1901, when she fell into disuse and disrepair.\n\n\"America\" was sold to a company headed by Charles Foster in 1917, and in 1921 was sold to the \"America\" Restoration Fund, who donated her to the U. S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. She was not maintained there either, and by 1940 had become seriously decayed. On March 29, 1942, during a heavy snowstorm, the shed where \"America\" was stored collapsed. Three years later, in 1945, the remains of the shed and ship were finally scrapped and burned.\n\nThe first replica of \"America\" was built by Goudy & Stevens Shipyard in Boothbay, Maine and launched in 1967. She was built for Rudolph Schaefer, Jr., owner of F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Co. Construction was supervised by her first skipper, Newfoundland born Capt. Lester G. Hollett.\n\nA second replica of \"America\" was built in 1995 by Scarano Boatbuilding of Albany, NY for Ray Giovanni and was operated by him for commercial events until his death. The replicas had several modifications from the original design including widening the beam by 4 feet to accommodate interior layouts. The original design had only one lantern (skylight) so three were added to bring light into the interior of the yacht. The yacht spent several years in Key West Florida and now operates whale watching and racing tours out of San Diego. She was exhibited in June 2011 in San Francisco Bay in concert with exploratory preparations by the Oracle Racing team for the 2013 America's Cup race, to be held within the bay. She is now owned by Troy Sears's company Next Level Sailing, and sails around the world as an official licensed partner for the America’s Cup Tour.\n\nA third replica was built in Varna, Bulgaria in 2005. Christened \"Skythia\", the boat's home port today is Rostock, Germany, where she is used for commercial charter.\n\n"}

The four-bar system has been used on mountain bikes since the early days of suspension. Similar suspension systems to the DW-link have been used by Schwinn, Fisher and Karpiel. Currently a similar system is used by Giant and named \"Maestro\". DW-link gets its name from the designer and patent holder, mechanical engineer Dave Weagle. Currently the DW-link has been licensed to the following bicycle companies: PIVOT Cycles, Ibis, Independent Fabrication, Turner Suspension Bicycles, and Iron Horse Bicycles. The DW-link suspension design was used to win six Elite level UCI downhill World Championships from 2005 to 2007, the highest contested level of the sport. This winning streak made the dw-link the most successful linkage suspension platform in the history of the sport of downhill. Dave Weagle also developed the Split Pivot suspension and Delta System which are both used in cycling.\n\nWeagle's design currently holds multiple patents, including US7128329, which is the world's first and remains to be the only published account on the method of mathematically and geometrically characterizing linkage chain/ belt-driven, and shaft-driven motorcycle and bicycle suspensions. The 7128329 introduced several new concepts and measurements to the suspension world, specifically the concept of characterizing anti-squat as a curve or area when graphed as a function of anti-squat versus compressive travel. The portfolio also proposed the same basic measurement for braking squat versus compressive travel distance. These measurements are now accepted as \"anti-squat curves\" and \"braking squat curves\" by some professionals in the field of vehicle suspension dynamics.\n\nRecreational mountain biker Dave Weagle used his background in four-wheeled vehicle suspension dynamics to investigate the linkage axle path of bicycle suspension systems. The analysis method that Weagle developed stands as the first published text on the analysis of linkage suspension systems for chain driven wheels. Weagle's research was directed towards what is known among mountain bikers as \"suspension bob.\" Analysis revealed that the \"bob\" was a result of the combined effects of load transfer during acceleration and the unbalanced forces of the rider's legs moving up and down. It was realized that the use of anti-squat could counteract the load transfer and pedaling induced forces that produced \"suspension bob\" and limited traction.\n\nBicycles have a short wheelbase relative to the height of their center of mass, when compared to other vehicles such as cars. Because bicycles are pedalled, their forward acceleration tends to be in surges while each pedal is under power. Because the driving force at the rear wheel is not aligned with the center of mass, the bicycle experiences a torque, according to Euler's second law. This torque is partially responsible for the compression of the rear suspension under power known as squat. Squat which occurs in time with pedalling is known as \"suspension bob.\"\nSuspension bob has three main causes: \n\nOn bikes which are subject to bob, the following two techniques can reduce it.\n\nHowever, neither of these solutions are ideal as they hinder the suspension's ability to absorb small bumps or low-speed impacts while the bicycle is coasting (Note: \"low-speed\" does not refer to the velocity at which the vehicle is traveling, but the speed at which the suspension is compressed). In the case of excessive compression damping, this problem is known as overdamping.\n\nThe DW-link uses an anti-squat suspension design to counteract forces responsible for \"suspension bob\" and consequently removes the need for excessive compression damping. This allows the suspension to be much more active over low-speed impacts, allowing more traction.\n\nThe DW-link uses anti-squat to eliminate \"suspension bob.\" Squat is defined as the tendency of rear suspension to compress under acceleration. The anti-squat used in the DW-link system is achieved by a minimisation of torque about the centre of mass. The DW-link system has also been designed to minimise pedal feedback caused by suspension travel.\n\nAnother major advantage of the DW-link is the lack of need of a floating brake system to achieve optimum suspension performance under braking. Typically, on single pivot suspension systems, a large amount of squat is experienced under braking without a floating brake design. Subsequently, the suspension is less active under braking, resulting in a diminished amount of traction.\n\nThe dw-link design is engineered to balance the effects of acceleration and braking forces in order to improve traction and efficiency. It uses a kinematic suspension force called \"position sensitive anti-squat.\" When a vehicle accelerates the suspension reacts (typically in the form of suspension compression) to a phenomenon called load transfer. The position-sensitive anti-squat of dw-link offsets the rearward load transfer that happens during vehicle acceleration. This unique attribute is mathematically proven to reduce efficiency losses, while improving traction, and bump sensitivity, and if properly engineered, will help minimize perceptible pedal feedback, when compared to other methods of achieving a similar offset of load transfer.\n\n"}

{"id": "23388960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23388960", "title": "Dime defense", "text": "Dime defense\n\nIn American football, the dime defense is a defensive alignment that uses six defensive backs. It is usually employed in obvious passing situations. The formation usually consists of six defensive backs, usually two safeties, and four cornerbacks, and has either four down linemen and one linebacker, or three down linemen and two linebackers. This formation is used to prevent the offense from completing a medium- to long-range pass play. This may be because the offense's running game is inefficient, time is an issue, or they need a long pass for a first down. It is also used against teams whose pass-to-run ratio predominantly favors pass. The formation, however, is vulnerable to running plays as the formation is missing two linebackers, or a linebacker and a down lineman.\n\nA dime defense differs from the nickel defense – from which it derives its name – in that it adds a sixth defensive back to the secondary. This sixth defensive back is called a \"dimeback\" (D). The defense gets its name because a dime, worth ten cents, is the next step up in United States coin currency from a nickel, which is worth 5 cents. \n\nThere are also \"quarter\" and \"half-dollar\" formations, each protecting against progressively deeper and more likely pass attempts. In 2010, the New York Giants consistently added an extra safety instead of an extra cornerback, resulting in three safeties and three cornerbacks. This has been called a \"giant dime\".\n"}

{"id": "2897051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2897051", "title": "Fantasy basketball", "text": "Fantasy basketball\n\nFantasy basketball is a fantasy sport for basketball that was popularized during the 1990s after the advent of the Internet. Players take the role of general managers (GMs) of the fantasy teams they create from drafting actual National Basketball Association (NBA) players based primarily on their basketball statistics. The statistics can be computed by the GM, or more commonly by the gaming software. The online format of the game has been popularized by websites, such as ESPN Fantasy Sports, NBA.com, and Yahoo! Fantasy Sports.\n\nThe following websites provide the season long fantasy basketball experience for users. \n\n\nThe following websites provide daily fantasy basketball experience for users. \n\nThere are many rule variations when playing fantasy basketball. The rules used in a particular league are determined by the rule settings. Some common rule variations are discussed below.\n\nCommonly, fantasy basketball leagues may track as few as three or as many as eleven categories. Three-category leagues usually account for only points, rebounds, and assists. Five-category leagues generally add blocks and steals. Eight-category leagues usually add field goal percentage, free throw percentage, and either three-point field goals made or three-point field goal percentage. Nine-category leagues usually add turnovers. Rarely, other statistics such as fouls are counted. Some leagues also prefer to break down the rebounds category into two categories: offensive and defensive rebounds.\n\nSome leagues allow the league \"commissioner\" to determine which categories will be tracked. If these categories are chosen poorly, the league may be unfairly weighted for or against certain positions. For example, a league that tracks points, assists, steals, free throw percentage and three-point field goals would be weighted toward guards, who typically have higher numbers in many of those categories, and against power forwards and centers, who typically have higher numbers in the rebound, block and field goal percentage categories, which are not counted.\n\nFor a standard 12-team league, the manager will usually draft 13 players. The roster considers to draft the following: \n\nSome leagues include an IR (Injury Reserve) roster spot pushing the count of the roster to 14. The IR is an extra spot on the roster that is used for players who suffer a prolonged injury or are out indefinitely.\n\nSome leagues also have a limit on the number of positions you can draft. For example; ESPN allows only a maximum of 4 centers on a roster. This is to prevent a manager from drafting a majority of centers, leaving no centers for other managers.\n\nIn public leagues, the typical number of teams in a league is typically ten or twelve. Though, the number of teams allowed are (8 to 12). A Public League is a league where anyone can join. The league does not require an invitation from a commissioner, rather it is open publicly on the websites, ESPN Fantasy Basketball, Yahoo Fantasy Basketball, etc. In private leagues, which are invitation-only and usually utilized by players who want to compete against a group of people they know, the number of teams will vary substantially (4 to 20). \n\nThere are two types of drafting used to select players: the snake draft and the auction draft. In a snake draft, the first round is drafted in order. In the second round, the draft order is reversed so that the manager who made the last pick in the first round gets the first pick in the second round. The order is reversed at the end of each round so that the manager with the first overall pick does not maintain this advantage in every round. In an auction draft, each manager has a set budget (commonly $260, an amount borrowed from fantasy baseball) that he or she must use to fill out the team's roster. Players are put up for auction by managers, and the manager willing to pay the most for the player \"drafts\" that player. The advantage of an auction is that all managers have equal access to all players (not the case in a snake draft). The disadvantages are that it typically takes longer than a snake draft, and can be intimidating for newer or inexperienced managers who may be relying on ranking.\n\nA draft date and time, seconds per pick, draft order and allow draft pick trading are settings that may be edited by the commissioner.\n\nIn a keeper league, the season does not finish at the end of the year. A manager's team is carried over in the following season and players can be kept between seasons. A commissioner can decide:\n\nWaiver Wire is specifically used for player transactions. The waiver wire consists of a list of available players that were not drafted and/or players that were dropped from a manager's roster. Managers can also drop a player(s), which inserts the dropped player into the waiver wire. Waiver wire is accessible to all players in a league. Waiver wire may have restrictions / specific rules depending on commissioner's preferred settings.\n\nSome leagues have a feature whereby players can communicate through the site. Many sites have \"Smack Talk\" features which allow players to communicate with one another whenever they want. They can trash-talk their opponents during the game or before the games start.\n\nA draft kit on any Fantasy Basketball website usually contains articles with advice from their staff. The staff consists of basketball analysts, writers, and experts where they give their input about players, games and trades that happen before or after the season. Though, most of the advice contains information about NBA players and their statistics. While some of the article are free to read, some articles require a paid subscription to access the information.\n\nIn rotisserie scoring, the real-life statistics accumulated by the players on a team are aggregated and ranked against the same statistics for the other teams in the league. Fantasy points are earned based on these rankings. For example, in a twelve-team league, the team with the most rebounds over the course of the season to date would be awarded twelve fantasy points. The team with the next-highest number of rebounds would be awarded eleven fantasy points, and so on, with the team with the fewest rebounds being awarded a single fantasy point. For negative categories like fouls or turnovers, the team with the fewest statistics is awarded the most fantasy points. This is done for all categories counted by the particular league. The team with the highest number of fantasy points at the end of the season is the winner.\n\nRotisserie scoring encourages balance on the team's roster. Winning the rebounds category by one rebound or by one thousand rebounds counts the same, while winning the steals category by one steal and the assists category by one assist is worth \"twice\" as many points as winning the single rebounding category by one thousand rebounds. Successful teams must fare well in several categories to win in rotisserie leagues.\n\nIn head-to-head scoring, teams compete against a single other team over the course of a week. During that week, the real-life statistics of the players on each team are accumulated, and at the end of the week the team with the most points over the week wins.\n\nThere are two styles of head-to-head scoring:\n\nHead-to-head leagues often employ a \"playoff\" system, with seeding based on the seasonal win-loss record. Matchups are determined via a bracket, with the winners of each matchup advancing and the losers being eliminated until a winner is determined.\n\nIn head-to-head leagues, schedules can be changed in the time until the first game of that match-up.\n\nIn fantasy point scoring, the commissioner determines the number of fantasy points that a particular statistic is worth. For example, the commissioner may determine that a steal is worth two fantasy points, where a rebound is only worth one, and a turnover is worth negative one. Fantasy points are accumulated nightly based on the real-life performance of the players on each team, and the team with the most fantasy points at the end of the season wins.\n\nAs when choosing categories, care must be paid in assigning fantasy point values to categories. Failure to achieve balance will result in weighting the league for or against players at certain positions.\n\nLike traditional fantasy basketball, in daily fantasy basketball, players draft a team of NBA players who then score fantasy points according to set scoring rules. However, instead of being stuck with the same team through a whole season, daily fantasy sports contests last just one day. Many sites offer data and strategies to build lineups; some of these sites are free, while others charge a fee.\n\nSome other daily basketball contests incorporate a few of the traditional settings combined with daily fantasy basketball settings to create a new experience for users. \n"}

{"id": "733270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=733270", "title": "Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium", "text": "Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium\n\nJohnny Rosenblatt Stadium was a baseball stadium in Omaha, Nebraska, the former home to the annual NCAA Division I College World Series and the minor league Omaha Royals, now known as the Omaha Storm Chasers. Rosenblatt Stadium was the largest minor league baseball stadium in the United States (a distinction now held by Buffalo, New York's Sahlen Field).\n\nThe final College World Series game at Rosenblatt Stadium was played on June 29, 2010. The final game for the Royals in the stadium, and under the Royals name, was played on September 2, 2010, with the Royals defeating the Round Rock Express. The Omaha Nighthawks played their 2010 season at Rosenblatt; Creighton Prep played a football game there as well.\n\nFollowing those events, Rosenblatt was replaced by TD Ameritrade Park Omaha. Rosenblatt Stadium began demolition in late July (after being reopened during the 2012 College World Series for fans to visit again). The pressbox girders were imploded on the morning of August 22, 2012. The site is currently owned by the Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium.\n\nOmaha Municipal Stadium was built in 1947, ready to host the single-A Omaha Cardinals for the 1948 season. The St. Louis Cardinals farm team was the first professional baseball team to call Omaha its home. Over the next few years Rosenblatt hosted several different teams. In 1969, the Kansas City Royals moved their triple-A franchise here, which played at Rosenblatt through the 2010 season.\n\nIn 1964, the stadium was renamed to honor former Omaha mayor Johnny Rosenblatt, who was instrumental in bringing professional baseball as well as the College World Series to Omaha.\n\nTeam moved into Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1998, after the AA folded.\n\nTeam was named \"Omaha Golden Spikes\" during 1998–2001.\n\nFrom 1950 to 2010 Rosenblatt Stadium was home to the College World Series. After the initial contract between the NCAA and the City of Omaha expired, the parties quickly agreed to renew. Currently, the NCAA and the city of Omaha have agreed to continue hosting the Men's College World Series in Omaha through the 2035 season.\n\nDue to growth in the event, the City of Omaha devoted resources to the stadium to accommodate teams and fans. In 2001, for example, more than $7 million was spent on the stadium. One of the major additions was 10,000 new seats, bringing the total capacity to 23,145.\n\nThe record for most consecutive sellouts at Rosenblatt stands at 82 consecutive games. In 2002, the College World Series surpassed the 5,000,000 spectator mark in all-time attendance.\n\nIn 1999, the local event organizers, College World Series of Omaha, Inc., placed the sculpture \"Road to Omaha\" in front of the main entrance. Created by local artist John Lajba, the sculpture shows three players celebrating by lifting one of their teammates in the air. One of the players whose likeness was used to create the statue (far right) is the current University of Virginia head coach Brian O'Connor. O'Connor is a native of Council Bluffs, Iowa and was a CWS participant as a pitcher for Creighton in '91, as an assistant with Notre Dame in '02, and with Virginia in 2009 and 2011.\n\nWith the anticipated opening of TD Ameritrade Park Omaha in 2011, the College World Series moved to this new stadium, and the renamed Storm Chasers moved to Werner Park in Sarpy County.\n\nAlthough the stadium's size was not an issue for the College World Series, expansions over the years made it far too large for a Triple-A team. In its final configuration, it had over 5,000 more seats than the next-largest stadium, Buffalo's Sahlen Field. The Royals struggled for years to fill it for regular season games. In the stadium's final years, capacity was reduced to 8,500 for Royals games. During the CWS, the Royals were forced to go on an extended road trip for much of June.\n\nThere had been discussion since 2003 of building a separate venue for the Royals, which also could have been shared by Creighton University and/or the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Royals president and part owner Alan Stein stated he would be willing to invest $10 million into a new 7,500 seat stadium for the Royals. Although initial plans called for TD Ameritrade Park to be reduced to 12,000 seats for Royals games, Stein said that would not be a viable alternative, presumably because the Royals would have still had to go on an extended road trip in June during the CWS. The Royals believed that a smaller, more intimate stadium would double annual attendance up to 500,000–600,000. According to Stein, that increase would have been unlikely at either Rosenblatt or a large downtown stadium.\n\nThe Royals had named multiple other cities with whom they have discussed stadium relocation, but decided to stay in greater Omaha with the construction of Werner Park in Sarpy County.\n\nIn May 2007 a grassroots organization called \"Save Rosenblatt\" tried to save the stadium for the use by College World Series. The group aired a TV commercial with actor Kevin Costner and proposed architectural plans for a renovation of Rosenblatt. The group also created an informational website. The group was composed primarily of governmental spending critics and homeowners near Rosenblatt Stadium who stood to lose money from the loss of proximity of the College World Series.\n\nThe members of \"Save Rosenblatt\" believed that Rosenblatt Stadium should be retained and enhanced, saying that the CWS and the City of Omaha would have been better served by a remodeled Rosenblatt and modified area around the stadium. However, on February 27, 2008, after nearly five months of deliberation, Omaha Mayor Mike Fahey and the stadium committee made a public recommendation for a new downtown stadium. This proposal included plans for the demolition of Rosenblatt Stadium. Many citizens of South Omaha responded with disappointment and frustration over the lack of public participation in the project planning and a lack of a public vote on a multimillion-dollar project. Other concerns focused on the financing and certainty of the construction costs of the new stadium.\n\nIn response, fans have begun a movement to build an online museum of Rosenblatt Stadium.\n\nOn April 30, 2009, the city and the NCAA agreed on a memorandum of understanding, outlining a preliminary agreement to keep the World Series in Omaha for another 25 years through 2035. The agreement stipulated that the series be moved to the new downtown stadium by 2011.\n\nOn April 15, 2010, it was announced that Rosenblatt Stadium would be home to the Omaha Nighthawks in the United Football League for its inaugural 2010 season. For 2011 and beyond, the Nighthawks would move into the new TD Ameritrade Park.\n\nThe Nighthawks played four games at Rosenblatt Stadium during the 2010 UFL season, selling out all four, the only UFL team to do so. The league was so impressed by the attendance that they awarded the 2010 UFL Championship Game to Rosenblatt, which was the last event ever held there.\n\nPlans called for the site of Rosenblatt Stadium to be sold to pay off the debt remaining from the stadium's multimillion-dollar renovations. The adjacent Henry Doorly Zoo purchased control of the land and demolished Rosenblatt once the new downtown stadium was completed. While the stadium land itself is now used for parking, it is part of an ongoing overall expansion of the zoo that will include a new visitor's center and a new Arctic exhibit on what is now the Zoo's primary parking area east of 10th Street. A tribute to Rosenblatt, sized to Little League standards, will be created within the new parking space created by the stadium's demolition. On March 8, 2011, the Omaha City Council formally approved the sale of Rosenblatt to the Zoo for $12 million. Demolition of Rosenblatt began in July 2012; the city of Omaha will use the money gained from Rosenblatt's sale, to pay off debts which had been incurred in the stadium's renovations over the years.\n\nJohnny Rosenblatt Stadium was one of the few stadiums to still use live music instead of prerecorded music. Lambert Bartak, an organist for the Royals, is one of only three organists ever to be ejected during a game, the others being Wilbur Snapp and Derek Dye.\n\nThe playing field in Rosenblatt Stadium had the ability to stay playable with even an 8.5 inch per hour rainfall.\n\nBefore remodeling and reconfiguration for the 2002 season, the foul lines were (later ), the power alleys were (later ), and center field was (later ). The field was aligned northeast (home plate to center field) at an approximate elevation of above sea level, nearly above the Missouri River.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40516698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40516698", "title": "Passion for Skiing", "text": "Passion for Skiing\n\nPassion for Skiing is a book that was published in 2010 about the contributions of people from Hanover, New Hampshire and Dartmouth College to winter activities, particularly the sport of downhill skiing and highlights this history of skiing from 1910 to the current era. It was authored by Dartmouth alumnus Stephen L. Waterhouse (Dartmouth College Class of 1965, Tuck Business School Class of 1967), a native of Sanford Maine and part-time Vail, Colorado resident with the help of other alumni and ski historians. The entire 426-page book, with its more than 50 contributing authors scattered across the US and abroad, was edited solely via email by Nick Stevens (Class of 1958), a former Dartmouth ski instructor, on his home computer in MD and printed by Whitman Communications of Lebanon, NH.\n\nThe Dartmouth College impact on skiing continues. The college maintains its own ski area, the Dartmouth Skiway, a 100-acre (0.40 km2) skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in Lyme Center, New Hampshire, that serves as the winter practice grounds for the nationally dominant Dartmouth ski team. Along with the Middlebury College Snow Bowl, the Dartmouth Skiway is one of two remaining college-owned ski areas in the eastern United States. Dartmouth and Hanover have been home to numerous members of the National Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame.\n\nDartmouth and Hanover connected Winter Olympians won 5 medals in 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi Russia, the equivalent of 18th place on the country list Twelve Dartmouth alumni competed in Sochi. Three won medals (Gillian Apps (Dartmouth Class of 2006) won Gold in Women's Hockey, Andrew Weibrecht (Dartmouth Class of 2009) won Silver in Men's Super G alpine skiing and Hannah Kearney (Dartmouth Class of 2015) won Bronze in freestyle moguls skiing). All three athletes had won medals in prior Olympics. In addition, two other athletes with Dartmouth/Hanover connections won medals (Mikaela Shiffrin, a former Hanover NH resident and daughter of Dartmouth alumnus Jeff Shiffrin (Dartmouth Class of 1976) won Gold in the Women's Olympic Slalom and Gus Kenworthy, son of Dartmouth alumnus Peter Kenworthy (Dartmouth Class of 1977), won Silver in the inaugural slopestyle skiing event.) \n\nWaterhouse was assisted in writing the book by many contemporary historians of skiing such as Morten Lund, John Fry, Elisabeth Hussey and John Allen. The 440-page book covers founders of ski areas; founders of ski retail shops and the developers of ski resort residential and commercial buildings; initiators of extreme skiing like Bill Briggs (Dartmouth Class of 1954); creators of ski clothing, equipment and grooming technology; and some of the greatest ski racers at college, national and Olympic levels. It also discusses the nurses, doctors and ski patrollers who operate the medical facilities in ski communities. It also includes makers of ski movies and the founders of ski magazines.\n\nThe book has a foreword by two members of the National Ski Hall of Fame: Warren Miller, the legendary maker of ski movies, and Chick Igaya (Dartmouth Class of 1957), a three-time Olympic skier for Japan (a silver medalist in 1956 and the holder of the most NCAA championships). The appendix of the book has lists of people from Dartmouth who were ski racing champions, National Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame members and those who made significant contributions to the sport like Dick Durrance (Dartmouth Class of 1939) and John Litchfield (Dartmouth Class of 1939) \n\nStephen Waterhouse and the book were awarded an Ullr Award - 2011 by the International Ski History Association at its annual conference with the National Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame held in Sun Valley, April 2011 in honor of its 75th Anniversary The book has been made into the 2013 documentary film \"Passion for Snow\".\n\n\"Passion for Snow\" is a 62-minute documentary covering more than 100 years of skiing history at Dartmouth from the initial Dartmouth Winter Carnival to current times, as well as the college's influences and connections to developments in the ski industry. Stephen Waterhouse was the Executive Producer of the film and said it depicts \"champion skiers in action, but also people like Dr. Seuss (aka Theodor Seuss Geisel, Dartmouth Class of 1925), the late Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop (Dartmouth Class of 1937) and noted poet Robert Frost (Dartmouth Class of 1896), who were influenced in their careers after spending winters in Hanover.\" The film premiered in February 2013 at Dartmouth's Loew Auditorium at the Black Family Visual Arts Center during the 103rd Dartmouth Winter Carnival. The film also depicts Dartmouth skiers' involvement in World War II as part of the 10th Mountain Division, and the school's role in adaptive ski technology for the disabled. Paralympian Diana Golden, class of 1984, was Dartmouth's first disabled World Champion, won ten World Championships and a Gold medal in the 1988 Paralympic. Dr. Sarah Billmeier, Dartmouth Class of 1999, was a six time World Champion and winner of 13 Paralympic medals in four Paralympics. The film includes footage of Diana Golden, 1988 Olympic gold medalist, doing a giant slalom descent in Calgary on a single leg, in the adaptive ski competition.\n\nWaterhouse wrote the script with producer Lisa Densmore, Dartmouth class of 1983. Filmmaker Buck Henry, Class of 1952, narrates the film.

{"id": "1846915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846915", "title": "Stadion Maksimir", "text": "Stadion Maksimir\n\nStadion Maksimir (\"Maksimir Stadium\") is a stadium in the Croatian capital of Zagreb. It takes its name from the surrounding neighbourhood of Maksimir. The venue is primarily the home of Dinamo Zagreb, the top club of the country with 18 league titles. First opened in 1912, it has undergone many facelifts, and its current layout dates from a 1997 rebuilding. Many of the Croatian national football team's games are played at Maksimir, which competes with Poljud stadium for the biggest matches. The stadium also sometimes hosts other events such as rock concerts.\n\nThe stadium was first opened on 5 May 1912. On 26 May 1941, a representative of the fascist government of the Independent State of Croatia addressed young Zagreb students at their meeting at the Maksimir Stadium, and at one point ordered the Serbian and Jewish students to be segregated, but the children disobeyed. Soon afterwards, in June 1941, rebel youths burned the stadium down. In 1977, a movie \"Operation Stadium\" was made to commemorate the segregation incident.\n\nWhen the UEFA Euro 1976 final tournament was held in SFR Yugoslavia, Maksimir hosted the Netherlands v. Czechoslovakia semi-final match and the Netherlands v. Yugoslavia third place match.\n\nMaksimir was the central venue for the 1987 Summer Universiade hosted by the city of Zagreb.\n\nIn 1990, several events happened at Maksimir. On 13 May, the Dinamo Zagreb–Red Star Belgrade riot took place, an infamous riot involving Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade supporters. The last match of the Yugoslavia national football team was hosted at Maksimir on 3 June. On 17 October of the same year, Croatia played the United States in what was Croatia's first match in the modern era.\n\nIn 1998, plans were made for a massive renovation, and the first phase started the same year. The old northern stand was demolished and a new one built within a year. This renovation increased Maksimir's seating capacity to 38,079.\n\nAfter 1992, for 16 years the Croatian football team had a proud unbeaten record at this stadium in any competitive match, however on 10 September 2008 (two years after suffering a 2-0 defeat at the same venue) England became the first team to beat Croatia in Zagreb, winning 4-1, ending a thirty match undefeated streak.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, a little, but much needed \"facelifting\" was made on the stadium. All seats were replaced, a new drainage system, under-soil heating and automatic watering were installed along with a new turf, the athletic track was covered with blue artificial grass and all brick surfaces were covered in blue cloth.\n\nFour stands (8 sectors) contribute to the total seating capacity of 35,423:\n\n\nThe stadium has also been used as the venue for some big concerts, including:\n\nAccording to the 1998 plans, renovation was to include lowering the lawn and making the \"ring\" round the pitch in the place of running track and thus gain 16,000 new seats with the annex to the south stand with the final addition of a modern roof structure. Maksimir was to have 60,000 comfortable sitting places and was to be an exclusively football stadium like many others in Europe.\n\nIt has additionally been planned to build: new premises for Club's Management, Elegant \"Blue Lounge\", Big \"Trophy room\", football school premises, changing room, coach staff room, sports hall with gym, out patient clinic, restaurant, luxury hotel (\"A\" category) with 46 beds for visiting teams special importance will be given to the building which will connect west stand to the north stand. By this, all the conditions for hosting and organizing big European matches would be fulfilled, including UEFA offices, press club, press center, V.I.P. hospitality, etc. With that, the venue was to be one of the best equipped stadiums in Europe However, in the beginning of the 2000s, the renovations were suspended.\n\nAs of December 2007, the public was awaiting the presentation of new stadium, and in 2008 city government presented two potential stadiums, new Maksimir and Vulkan (Volcano) which is supposed to be built on another location (Kajzerica) in Zagreb and old Maksimir should then be knocked down, the citizens were to choose which one they want on the referendum predicted to take place somewhere in the near future. However, the city government never made any progress with referendum or these plans and the stadium remains to be a problem to the city for a decade now.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2015, a total of HRK 800 million (c. €108 million) has been spent renovating the stadium.\n\nStadion Kajzerica was a proposed new football stadium to be built in the Kajzerica neighborhood in Zagreb, intended to replace Stadion Maksimir as the home of the Croatia national football team and Dinamo Zagreb.\n\nThe design competition for the new stadium was won by architect Hrvoje Njirić in May 2008. The winning design, nicknamed The Blue Volcano () by the press, would have a capacity of 55,000 and would include a blue-coloured polycarbonate dome exterior and a cloud-like structure suspended above the stadium covered in photovoltaic panels.\n\nThe project had originally been intended to go ahead after it gained approval in a public referendum in which citizens of Zagreb would vote whether they would rather have the current Stadion Maksimir torn down and re-built in the same location (which would cost at least 264 million euros, according to offers submitted by construction companies) or replaced by an entirely new stadium at Kajzerica (whose construction cost is still unknown).\n\nAccording to the initial plan the first option would include building a smaller venue at Kajzerica between 2009 and 2011 which would then be used to host Dinamo Zagreb's matches while Maksimir stadium is undergoing rebuilding in the period between 2011 and 2014. The other option would include building the purpose-built 55,000 capacity Blue Volcano at Kajzerica, which would then become the Blues' permanent home.\n\nHowever, the referendum about the stadium, which had originally been scheduled for June 2008, was postponed several times since and has not been held.\n\nIn October 2012, the project was abandoned, to be briefly revived in 2013 with an eye to a possible UEFA Euro 2020 bid, and again in 2018, following Croatia's historic success in the World Cup.\n"}

{"id": "847759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=847759", "title": "Tannadice Park", "text": "Tannadice Park\n\nTannadice Park, usually referred to as Tannadice, is a football stadium in Dundee, Scotland. It is the home ground of Dundee United F.C., who have played at Tannadice since the club was founded as Dundee Hibernian in 1909. The stadium has been all-seated since 1994 and has a capacity of . It is located only from Dundee F.C.'s stadium, Dens Park; the two are the closest senior football grounds in the UK.\n\nThe ground was previously known as Clepington Park, and was used by a number of local teams in the 19th century. It was the home of Dundee Wanderers F.C. from 1894 until 1909, including their single season in membership of the Scottish Football League (1894–95). The name of the ground was changed to Tannadice when Dundee Hibernian took over the lease in 1909.\n\nThe ground that is now Tannadice (then called Clepington Park) was first used for football in the 1870s, when the surrounding area of Dundee was still largely open countryside. In July 1882, Dundee East End secured the use of Clepington Park for the coming season, remaining there until the following year, when they moved to Madeira Park. Clepington was also used by newly formed junior club Dundee Violet during the 1883–84 season.\n\nBoth clubs vacated Clepington in 1884; Violet relocated to Fairmuir, while East End had spells at Madeira Park and Pitkero Park before returning to Clepington in 1887. They remained there until moving to Carolina Port, the most developed ground in Dundee at the time, in 1891. East End would subsequently amalgamate with Dundee Our Boys to form Dundee F.C. in 1893. Clepington Park was subsequently taken over by Johnstone Wanderers, who had begun as an offshoot of Our Boys.\n\nBy this time, the surrounding modern street pattern had begun to emerge, with Provost Road, Arklay Street, and Clepington Road all having been laid out. West of Arklay Street remained open land while the east was being developed. By 1890, one of the new streets leading off Arklay Street had been given the name Tannadice Street.\n\nIn 1891, Johnstone Wanderers decided to enclose Clepington to enable them to charge for admission. In conjunction, it was decided to utilise the natural slope roughly a hundred yards to the west (below what is now Sandeman Street) in order to provide better views for spectators. As well as enclosing the new pitch, now situated on approximately its modern alignment, the club built a modest grandstand, a simple uncovered wooden structure with bench seating. It probably housed no more than 500 spectators.\n\nIn January 1894 Johnstone Wanderers merged with another local club, Strathmore, to form Dundee Wanderers. The new combination successfully applied for Scottish Football League membership and Clepington Park staged its first Scottish League fixture against Motherwell on 25 August 1894.\n\nWanderers struggled at national level, however, and were not re-elected at the end of the season, dropping down to the Northern League. From 1899, Wanderers had to contend with considerable competition for local support with the opening of Dens Park, the new Dundee F.C. ground. This was situated almost opposite Clepington, where the extended Tannadice Street met Sandeman Street at an angle. The two grounds are approximately 200 yards apart, which is the shortest distance between two senior football grounds in Britain. Only the grounds of two clubs in Budapest, MTK and BKV Elore, are closer together than Dens and Tannadice in the whole of Europe, as their grounds back onto each other.\n\n1909 saw the formation of Dundee Hibernian, a new club representing the city's Irish community, which had previously supported Dundee Harp. As much of the local Irish population was concentrated in the Lochee district, it was assumed the Hibs would seek to set up home in that area. However, rather than building a new ground from scratch, the new club's secretary Pat Reilly took the controversial step of approaching the landlord of Clepington Park to secure a ready-made venue. The Hibs committee made an offer to the landlords which exceeded what Wanderers were paying; as a result, the established tenants were informed that their lease would not be renewed for the coming season.\n\nThe extent of Wanderers' anger at this development is evident from their decision to effectively dismantle Clepington's fixtures and fittings. The grandstand, changing rooms, fencing and even the goalposts were removed, leaving Hibs with an open field rather than the ready-made ground they had envisaged. Nevertheless, the new club took over the lease, and a decision was taken to emphasise the new era by changing the name of the ground, Tannadice Park being adopted from the name of the street on which the ground's main entrance would be situated.\n\nHibs' first priority was to re-equip Tannadice for the new season and a new grandstand and fencing were soon provided. A cricket-style pavilion housing dressing rooms was constructed in the south east corner of the ground, where the players’ tunnel is today; this survived until 1961. An indication of the rapid development of the new Tannadice is contained in a report from the city’s \"Evening Telegraph\", 21 July 1909:\"‘The pavilion is a splendid two-storey structure built of brick, containing two large dressing-rooms, two committee rooms, press box and referee’s room. The pavilion will be lit by electricity. The stand on the road side will be the whole length of the field and will seat about 1,000 people.’\"\n\nThe club's and the ground's inaugural match was against Hibernian on 18 August 1909, in front of a crowd of 7,000. The original capacity of Tannadice Park was around 10,000, the terracings were specially extended and additional temporary seating erected for a Qualifying Cup-tie against Forfar Athletic in 1913; all of this was necessary to allow a record crowd to be accommodated, and the reported attendance was 15,000.\n\nDundee Hibs was renamed Dundee United in 1923, after a consortium had taken over the club and obtained re-election to the Scottish Football League.\n\nNo improvements to the ground were made until Dundee United won promotion to Division One for the first time in 1925. The Scottish League Management Committee informed the club that Tannadice would be subject to an inspection during the close season to ensure that it was up to the standard required for the higher level, and this clearly concentrated the directors’ minds. Since 1909, Tannadice had been leased, but the board now decided to buy the ground, paying £2,500. Extensive renovations were then begun, the first to the pitch. There was a steep upwards slope towards the corner where the George Fox and East Stands now meet, and this necessitated solid rock being blasted to enable it to be levelled. There is still a slope of approximately 2 metres from north-west to south-east today. For the first time, proper terracings were constructed, while the pavilion was given a facelift and new turnstiles were built.\n\nDuring the Second World War, United were forced to close down temporarily in 1940 due to there being no senior league operating in the area. As a result, an associated junior club, Dundee United Juniors, was formed to play at Tannadice. Although United returned to senior football in 1941, United Juniors continued to share the ground until they closed down in 1944.\n\nThe various financial crises which beset the club in the 1930s and its general lack of success on the pitch prevented any further ground improvements until 1953. At that time, the north terracing was concreted and four years later the same was done at both ends. During the close season of 1957, an important development took place with the construction of the Shed, which was opened in September of that year.\n\nThe new Main Stand, opened in August 1962, was the first in Scotland to be constructed with a cantilever roof to provide column-free viewing for spectators. It was intended at the time that the whole ground would be re-built in a similar manner, but due to lack of finance no further building took place. This meant that the stand, which had a very tight spacing between the rows of seats, is an unusual L-shape around the south-eastern corner of the ground. The stand was also the first in Scotland to have a glass fronted lounge for the benefit of sponsors. This was opened in 1971 and overlooked the pitch, something that is now a common sight in football grounds across the country.\n\nMuch of the stadium's development in the 1950s and 60s was funded by the introduction of 'Taypools' a football pool run by a separate development club known as the 'Dundee United Sportsmen's Club' all profits of which went to the football club. The scheme was introduced in 1955 by directors Johnstone Grant and George Fox having seen a similar scheme in operation at Nottingham Forest\n\nThe stadium celebrated its centenary in 1983 - the year that Dundee United won their first and to date only league title. Under-soil heating was installed during the close season of 1985 at a reported cost of £100,000, United were the fourth Scottish club to have the facility, following Queen's Park, Rangers and Hibernian. Unfortunately the first time the under-soil heating was called into action was when a fairly heavy snowfall started during the UEFA Cup 3rd round first leg tie against Neuchâtel Xamax on 27 November 1985 and the system failed.\n\n1988 saw the covering of the small enclosure adjacent to the Main Stand. This was named the Fair Play enclosure as it was financed by a cash award made by UEFA following the sporting behaviour of United fans following the 1987 UEFA Cup Final 2nd leg. The funds were awarded to the club with a clear stipulation from UEFA that it should be used to improve spectator facilities.\n\nAt the time of the Taylor Report on football ground safety, which was published in January 1990, Tannadice had a capacity of 22,310, but only 2,252 seats (all in the 1962 Main Stand). For a period in 1990, Dundee United considering sharing a new stadium with Dundee, but decided to redevelop Tannadice in 1991.\n\nMany modifications were made at Tannadice in order to bring the stadium up to modern standards. Two new grandstands were constructed in the early nineties. The two tiered George Fox stand, was built in 1992 and is named after a former chairman of the club. The East Stand, a similar two tiered construction was built in 1994, and was renamed the Eddie Thompson stand in 2008. The latest stand to be constructed was the Fair Play stand in 1997. This stand form an extension to the Jerry Kerr stand along one side of the pitch, and now houses away fans on match day. Tangerine plastic seating was installed in the West Stand at the same time, with black seats spelling out 'DUFC'. This development made Tannadice an all seater stadium. Several lesser modifications have taken place since the start of the 21st century, namely to allow participation in European competition. In 2009, the traditional flood lights were removed and replaced with a brighter roof mounted lighting system, and in 2010 the original wooden seats in the Jerry Kerr stand were removed and replaced with tangerine plastic seating.\n\nTannadice is an all-seater stadium and has been so since 1994. The various stands are as follows:\n\nThe Jerry Kerr Stand: Originally built in 1962, it was the first cantilevered stand at a football ground in Scotland and only the third in the UK (after Sheffield Wednesday and Scunthorpe).\n\nParticularly notable for its unusual L-shaped construction, the stand runs from the halfway line on the south (Tannadice Street) side of the pitch, bending around the ground's south east corner, to end slightly along the east goal-line. The only seated accommodation at the ground prior to the post-Taylor Report redevelopment, it was known simply as the Main Stand until 2003, when it was renamed in honour of Jerry Kerr, the manager who had overseen its construction. The development of other parts of Tannadice has meant that this stand is now normally reserved for away supporters.\n\nThe Jim McLean Fair Play Stand: The most recent addition to the stadium, opened in 1997. Although separately named, it is effectively an extension of the old Main Stand to cover the entirety of the ground's south side. The name derives from the Fair Play Enclosure, a small enclosed terrace which previously occupied this corner of Tannadice, and itself named for the award given to United and their fans by FIFA following the club's run to the 1987 UEFA Cup Final. This stand is also reserved for visiting supporters. It was renamed after the club's most successful manager Jim McLean in 2011.\n\nThe West Stand: Invariably referred to by its historic nickname, \"The Shed\", it retains its original roof construction dating from 1957; between then and 1980, it was the only covered standing area at Tannadice, therefore becoming the most popular and atmospheric part of the ground. Since 1994, seats have been installed on the original terracing, parts of which are still visible at the corners. With season ticket holders now accommodated in the more modern parts of the stadium, the Shed can be allocated to either home or away supporters as demand dictates.\n\nThe George Fox Stand: Named after a long serving club director, this two-tier stand was built in 1991–92 along the north side of the ground and was the first phase in the conversion of Tannadice to meet all-seater requirements. It is allocated to home supporters.\n\nThe Eddie Thompson Stand: Opened in 1994 as the \"East Stand\", and with a similar design to the adjacent George Fox Stand, it also has two tiers of seating. The East Stand now houses the loudest and most passionate elements of the United support, whereas George Fox patrons have the reputation of being somewhat more restrained in their behaviour. As such, this end of Tannadice is the spiritual heir of the old \"Shed\". In March 2008, the stand was renamed after the then terminally ill club chairman, Eddie Thompson.\n\nOfficial attendance figures are largely unavailable in Scottish football prior to the 1980s, other than for Scottish Cup ties, but the following figures as reported in the media give a guide to the progressive record attendance figures at Tannadice down the years.\n\nDundee Hibs' first match at Tannadice, a friendly against Hibernian of Edinburgh on 18 August 1909, was watched by a crowd of 7,000. This figure appears to be in excess of any crowd to watch a league fixture at the ground prior to the First World War. Cup ties tended to attract higher attendances in this era, and after the terraces were specially extended to accommodate the expected large crowd, 15,000 watched a Scottish Qualifying Cup tie against Forfar Athletic on 1 November 1913.\n\nPromotion to the top flight in 1925 saw further ground improvements and two new records set, firstly when 20,000 were estimated to have watched Celtic's visit on 19 September 1925. Then a much larger than anticipated crowd of 23,517 packed in to watch an important late season Tayside derby against St Johnstone on 17 April 1926, with both clubs fighting relegation.\n\nThe largest crowd to have watched a League fixture at Tannadice was 25,000 in the derby against Dundee on 3 January 1927. This remained the overall record until 23 February 1952, when 26,407 saw a Scottish Cup tie against Aberdeen, the all-time record for any domestic fixture on the ground. To date, the official record attendance at Tannadice remains the 28,000 who watched the club's home European debut, an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup match against FC Barcelona on 16 November 1966. Since then, in common with many other grounds, safety legislation and conversion to all-seating has drastically reduced Tannadice's capacity, with the modern stadium holding little over half that number.\n\nTannadice staged a B international match between Scotland and Turkey in December 2003.\n\nTannadice was the first venue in Dundee to stage greyhound racing when it came to the city in 1928. The first meeting took place on 18 May 1928. The track was independent (unlicensed) and meetings were held regularly on Saturdays and Wednesdays during the summer. Despite reasonable crowds the layout of the venue was not particularly suited to racing and it ended during the same year. Dens Park would become Dundee's regular greyhound venue from 1932.\n\nOn 1 January 1941, during a season when Dundee United were inactive due to the Second World War, a boxing match was staged at Tannadice. Local boxer Jim Brady defeated Kid Tanner of British Guiana to win the British Empire bantamweight title in front of 3,500 spectators.\n\n"}

One intended use of waterproof audio players is to listen to audio where regular portable audio players cannot be used so as not to risk getting them wet. As advances in technology makes them smaller and lighter, they are becoming more and more popular in swimming pools.\n\nWhile waterproof Cassette players and CD players were developed and manufactured, their size, coupled with the fact that both had to include an opening mechanism, prevented customers from using them while swimming. Generally, they were intended for use in a shower or by a pool. They were rarely to be actually submerged in water.\nWith the advent of mp3 players, things began to change. The players became smaller and did not have to be opened, therefore making it much easier to waterproof them. The first waterproof mp3 player was produced by Oregon Scientific and several others followed.\n\nTypically, waterproof mp3 players have only one exit, intended both for the headphones cord and to be connected to a computer for loading audio. They are built to be minimal in weight and size, and are rarely capable of playing or displaying anything but audio information. In addition, the interface is minimized to include only the necessary buttons. Often waterproof mp3 players include a clasp to be connected to the goggles.\nAlternatively, a regular mp3 player can be waterproofed by putting it in a waterproof casing and connecting with waterproof headphones. Companies such as Action Audio, H2O Audio, Otterbox and Aquapac make such products. They have been sold and advertised in Runner magazine.\n\n"}

It was the home ground of Aston Villa from 1876 until 1897.\n\nWellington Road was opened in 1876 when Aston Villa moved to the ground. There were initially no spectator facilities, players changed in a nearby blacksmith's shed, and a hayrick was kept on the pitch, which had to be removed prior to matches. However, the ground was gradually improved, with a grandstand built on the eastern touchline and two pavilions built on the western touchline and behind the southern goal line.\n\nThe ground's record attendance of 26,849 was set for an FA Cup fifth round match against Preston North End on 7 January 1888. Preston won 3–1, and the match was marred by a huge pitch invasion, the first serious incidence of crowd trouble in English football. Later in 1888 Villa were founder members of the Football League, and the first League match was played at Wellington Road on 15 September 1888, with Villa beating Stoke 5–1 in front of 2,000 spectators. \n\nDuring the 1890s Wellington Road was used to host two FA Cup semi-finals. In 1889–90 it hosted the Bolton Wanderers–The Wednesday match (1–2), and in 1895–96 hosted the Derby County–Wolverhampton Wanderers game (also 1–2). It was also used as a home venue for the England team, hosting a British Home Championship match on 25 February 1893, with England beating Ireland 6–1.\n\nHowever, with an uneven pitch and growing crowds, it became increasingly apparent that a new ground was required. Villa moved to Villa Park towards the end of the 1896–97 season, with the last league match played at Wellington Road on 22 March 1897. Villa beat Bolton Wanderers 6–2, with a crowd of 8,000 in attendance.\n\nPart of the site was later used for housing, with the remainder becoming a car park, pub and recreation ground.\n"}

It was also the venue for the annual Osaka Grand Prix athletics meeting which took place every May from 1996 to 2010, and it is still the starting and finishing point for the Osaka International Ladies Marathon, held annually in late January-early February.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
