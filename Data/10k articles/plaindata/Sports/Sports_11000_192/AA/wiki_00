Again an Australasian side rather than an Australian team alone (although the 28-man squad featured only one New Zealander) travelled to Great Britain to contest the Ashes. Coached by Arthur Hennessy and captained by Les Cubitt, the Kangaroos travelled on the RMS \"Tahiti\" to England for best-of-three series of Test matches against Great Britain for the Ashes. The tour took place during the 1921–22 Northern Rugby Football Union season and also featured matches against several of the clubs in that competition as well as other representative teams. The tour also involved some degree of player misbehaviour, with one young footballer almost sent home from San Francisco because of all the broken glasses following a drinking session on board the team′s ship.\n\nDuring 1921 the New Zealand side toured Australia, playing matches against New South Wales and Queensland, which served as selection trials for the upcoming 'Australasian' team's tour, for which only one New Zealander, Bert Laing, selected. The team wore the sky blue jersey of New South Wales and the only non-New South Welsh player to appear in a test was Queenslander Billy Richards in the third.\n\nBilly Cann was co-manager of the Australasian touring squad along with Souths' secretary, George Ball. Secretary of the Queensland Rugby League, and football journalist Harry Sunderland also accompanied the team.\n\nOn this tour Sandy Pearce at 38 years of age became the oldest Australian international player.\n\nEarly in the 1921 NSWRFL season, players who were selected had to leave their clubs for the tour. All but one of the League's nine teams (University) were represented in the touring squad:\n\n\nThe sole New Zealand player that accompanied the Australians on tour has been listed in the Australian Rugby League's Kangaroos players register.\n\nBefore sailing for England the team stopped in New Zealand for an exhibition match at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. Also during the tour, the Northern Rugby Football Union tried to arrange a match in Paris, but opposition from the RFU-aligned French Rugby Federation made it impossible.\n\nAfter arriving in England, the Kangaroos played four matches against local clubs before the first Ashes test, winning all of them with dominant margins:\n\nThe Kangaroos' winning streak came to an end when they played against England. Australasia led 5-3 at the break and the match seemed to be theirs when Frank Burge scored a late try, but it was disallowed by referee Frank Renton. Thus, a sole second-half try from the British close to full-time was enough for them to win it.\n\nAt halftime York led 4 - 3 in a game that \"was characterised by rough and scrambling play, minor injuries being numerous.\"\n\nIn the second Test the scores were 2-all at half-time, but after that the Australian backline of Horder, Carstairs, Vest and Blinkhorn cut loose. The Kangaroos scored 4 tries to nil, the win setting up the third and final Test as the Ashes decider. This was also the last Test in the international career of Sandy Pearce and made him the oldest ever Kangaroo.\nThe Kangaroos played sixteen more tour matches between the second and third Tests:\nUp to and including the final Kangaroo Tour which included matches against English club sides in 1994, this would be the highest ever score by the Kangaroos. The closest The Kangaroos ever came to this score was an 80–2 win over the Sheffield Eagles in 1994.\n\nAmong those present for this match was the UK's Speaker of the House of Commons, J. H. Whitley. The half-time score was 18 - 3 in favour of the visitors, who were without Dick Vest due to ill health.\n\nThe decider was played on a heavy, snow-bound field, much to the dismay of the fleet-footed Kangaroos. Early in the match the Australians were reduced to twelve men when Chook Fraser suffered a broken leg. In what was described as \"a bruising encounter\", Herman Hilton took a pass from his captain, the \"prince of centres\", Harold Wagstaff to dive over, taking two defenders over the try-line with him. The final score was 6 - 0 in favour of the home side. By winning this third and deciding test of the series, Britain claimed the Ashes.\n\nBy the end of the tour, Australian three-quarter, Cec Blinkhorn, had scored 39 tries in 29 matches, which still stands as the record for most tries scored on a Kangaroo tour and will most likely never be beaten. Other winger, Harold Horder scored 35, and forward Frank Burge was not far behind with 33 tries from 23 games.\n\nThe team travelled back to Australia on the \"Orvieto\", arriving in Fremantle in February 1922. Upon their return to Sydney a large dinner was held for the tourists by the New South Wales Rugby Football League, which was attended by the likes of Sir Joynton Smith, to celebrate the players' courageous effort and the fact that this was the first team to return to Sydney with a profit.\n\n"}

{"id": "98971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98971", "title": "Busch Memorial Stadium", "text": "Busch Memorial Stadium\n\nBusch Memorial Stadium, also known as Busch Stadium II, was a multi-purpose sports facility in St. Louis, Missouri, that operated for 40 years, from 1966 through 2005.\n\nThe stadium served as the home of the St. Louis Cardinals National League baseball team for its entire operating existence, while also serving as home to the National Football League's Cardinals team for 22 seasons, from 1966 through 1987, as well as the St. Louis Rams during part of the 1995 season. It opened four days after the last baseball game was played at Sportsman's Park (which had also been known since 1953 as Busch Stadium).\n\nThe stadium was designed by Sverdrup & Parcel and built by Grün & Bilfinger. Edward Durell Stone designed the roof, a 96-arch \"Crown of Arches\". The Crown echoed the Gateway Arch, which had been completed only a year before Busch Stadium opened. It was one of the first multipurpose \"cookie-cutter\" facilities built in the United States, popular from the early 1960s through the early 1980s.\n\nIts final event was the sixth game of the 2005 NLCS on October 19. The stadium was demolished by wrecking ball in late 2005 and part of its former footprint is occupied by its replacement stadium—the new Busch Stadium (a.k.a. Busch Stadium III), located just south.\n\nThe baseball Cardinals had played at Sportsman's Park since . They originally were tenants of the St. Louis Browns of the American League. Although the Cardinals had long since passed the Browns as St. Louis' favorite team, they had wanted to get a stadium of their own as early as 1920.\n\nIn 1958, Charles Farris, the city's head of development, proposed a new stadium downtown as the core of a plan to revive a 31-block area of the business district. The original design of the stadium had called for a baseball-only format, but the design was altered to accommodate the football Cardinals, who had moved in from Chicago after the 1959 season and shared Sportsman's Park/Busch Stadium with the baseball Cardinals. With support from the local Chamber of Commerce, the Civic Center Redevelopment Corporation was established in September 1959; it was given power of eminent domain, which it used to condemn the city's small Chinatown, the Grand Theater (a strip club), and various warehouses and flophouses.\n\nGroundbreaking occurred on May 25, 1964, and construction took just under two years. The plan also included parking garages, a hotel (a Stouffer's hotel), and office buildings. A few years later, it also became the new home of the Spanish Pavilion from the 1964 New York World's Fair. The stadium opened on May 12, 1966, one month into the baseball season, as \"Civic Center Busch Memorial Stadium.\" However, the \"Civic Center\" part was almost never used, and most people called it simply \"Busch Memorial Stadium.\"\n\nThe stadium's grass was replaced with AstroTurf in 1970, in part because St. Louis' notoriously hot summers made it difficult to keep the grass alive. The Cardinals retained the traditional dirt skin infield for eight seasons, then converted to sliding pits when the surface was replaced for the 1978 baseball season. With artificial turf, the playing conditions at Busch Stadium were among the hottest in baseball, with temperatures well above the local official readings.\nAnheuser-Busch bought the stadium in 1981 for $53 million and renamed it simply Busch Stadium; the price included the parking garages.\n\nOver the years the grounds became home to bronze statues of Stan Musial, Enos Slaughter, Dizzy Dean, Rogers Hornsby, Red Schoendienst, Lou Brock, Bob Gibson, James \"Cool Papa\" Bell, George Sisler, Jack Buck, and Ozzie Smith.\n\nFollowing Busch's last 1995 event—the Rams' October 22 game prior to the opening of the now-Dome at America's Center—the Cardinals retrofitted it into a baseball-only stadium. A large section of the upper deck outfield seats was closed, replaced with a hand-operated scoreboard and flags commemorating the Cardinals' retired numbers and World Series championships. The stadium's original natural grass field was restored, and the outfield walls were repainted green from their original blue.\n\nBusch Memorial Stadium was originally slated to be imploded like most modern-day stadium demolitions to be able to finish construction on the new stadium in time for the 2006 season. Due to fear of damaging the nearby Metro subway and stadium station, it was decided to tear down the stadium with a wrecking ball, piece-by-piece, over a period of a few weeks.\n\nDemolition of the stadium began at 3:07 p.m. CST on November 7 and was completed shortly after midnight on December 8, 2005.\n\nPart of the footprint of the old stadium is now occupied by the outfield of the current stadium. The Cardinals had planned to build Ballpark Village on the site of the stadium ($320 million for the first phase). It was to consist of boutiques and restaurants, condominium apartments anchored by the new headquarters of Centene Corporation — all to be built in time for the All-Star Game in 2009.\n\nNone of the construction had occurred until groundbreaking ceremonies on February 8, 2013, and locals derisively referred to its rain soaked unfinished status before that date as \"Lake DeWitt\"—after Cardinal President William DeWitt, Jr. The Cardinals in March 2009 announced the site would be used for a softball field and parking during the game.\n\nBusch Stadium was also the home of the St. Louis Cardinals of the National Football League for 22 seasons, from 1966 through 1987. The stadium was one of the smaller facilities in the NFL, never seating more than 60,000. After efforts to get a larger stadium failed, owner Bill Bidwill moved the team to Phoenix, Arizona after the 1987 season.\n\nThe football Cardinals never hosted a playoff game during their 28 seasons in St. Louis. The \"Gridbirds\" made only three playoff appearances during that stretch, losing on the road against the Minnesota Vikings in 1974, Los Angeles Rams in 1975, and Green Bay Packers in 1982. They did win the third place Playoff Bowl after the 1964 season, upsetting Vince Lombardi's Packers 31–24 at the Orange Bowl in Miami.\n\nBusch Stadium was also briefly the home of the St. Louis Rams, who relocated from Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California. Completion of their new home, the new and nearby Trans World Dome (later renamed the Dome at America's Center) was delayed, so the Rams played the first half of the 1995 season at Busch Stadium, with four home games, the last on October 22. The new indoor venue hosted its first NFL game on November 12, 1995.\n\nIn between the Cardinals' and the Rams' eras, the stadium hosted two NFL exhibition games, between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots in 1989, and the New York Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs in 1991.\n\nIn its opening year, Busch Stadium hosted the All-Star Game, a 2–1 National League victory in 10 innings, mostly remembered for the humidity and temperatures. The stadium hosted World Series games in six different seasons: , , , , , and . The Cardinals won the World Series in 1967 and 1982 while playing in the stadium (the seventh game of the 1982 Series was won at Busch). The 1968 and 2004 World Series were clinched in Busch Stadium by visitors: the Detroit Tigers in the seventh game and the Boston Red Sox in a four-game sweep, respectively.\n\nThe stadium was also the site of Mark McGwire's historic 62nd home run of the 1998 season that broke Roger Maris' single-season record, and also of McGwire's 70th of that season, for a record which lasted until Barry Bonds surpassed it in 2001. The dimensions in center and the power alleys had been altered from time to time over the years. Initially the park was very favorable to pitchers, with spacious outfield dimensions. Consequently, its design (as well as the Astroturf surface) was favorable to the Cardinals' style of play for most of the time from the 1960s through the 1990s, which emphasized good baserunning and extra-base hits. Later changes attempted to make the outfield better balanced between pitching and power hitting.\n\nBefore the 1996 season, the stadium was retrofitted to become a baseball-only stadium. Part of the top deck in center field was permanently closed, and in 1997, flags were put in place to honor the team's retired numbers and pennants. Even before then, the stadium had come under less scorn from baseball purists than other cookie-cutter stadiums built during the same era, partly because the \"crown of arches\" gave it a more traditional look than its cousins.\n\nThe baseball diamond was oriented southeast by east (home to center field); the new stadium is aligned east-northeast, the recommended orientation.\n\nActs who have performed at Busch Stadium include:\n\n\n"}

It recounts the struggles of boxer \"Midge\" Kelly fighting his own demons while working to achieve success in the boxing ring. The drama was directed by Mark Robson, with cinematography by Franz Planer. The drama features Kirk Douglas, Marilyn Maxwell, and Arthur Kennedy.\n\nThe film won an Academy Award for Best Film Editing and gained five other nominations as well, including a Best Actor for Douglas.\n\nSeveral clips from the film were used in Douglas' 1999 film \"Diamonds\" to illustrate his character's career as a boxer.\n\nThe drama charts the story of Midge Kelly (Kirk Douglas), a boxer who pushes himself to the top of his game by knocking out opponents and back-stabbing his friends. He has no qualms about deceiving the various females he encounters and he eventually double-crosses Tommy Haley (Paul Stewart), the manager who found him and helped pave his road to fame.\n\nMichael \"Midge\" Kelly and his brother Connie Kelly (Arthur Kennedy) are crossing America by thumb and freight cars from Chicago to California, where they have bought a share in a restaurant. Along the way, they hitch a lift from a car carrying a top boxer, Johnny Dunne, and his girlfriend Grace Diamond (Marilyn Maxwell). They are driven to Kansas City where Dunne is fighting another contender that night.\n\nMidge needs money and is offered a fight on the under-card for $35. After taking a beating, the promoter only pays him $10, claiming the remainder as \"management and facility fees\". The fight brings him to the attention of fight trainer Tommy Haley, who tells him to come to his gym in Los Angeles if he ever needs a break. Kelly is not interested.\n\nOnce they reach Los Angeles, however, they discover they have been conned in the restaurant deal. The brothers need to secure jobs waiting tables and washing dishes. Both strike up a relationship with the owner's daughter, Emma (Ruth Roman). When Midge Kelly is discovered with her, they are forced to marry by her outraged father.\n\nAfter the shotgun wedding, Kelly abandons his new wife and flees with his brother. They head to the gym run by Haley.\n\nKelly enters his new field with a single-minded devotion. He defeats a number of local fighters, begins touring the country and is soon ranked as a contender. He is matched with Johnny Dunne, who is in line for a championship fight. Organized crime figures lean on Kelly to throw the match, guaranteeing him a legitimate shot at the title the following year if he complies. Kelly agrees, but then goes back on his word and destroys the complacent Dunne in a single round.\n\nSeeing which way the wind is blowing, Grace Diamond now attaches herself to Kelly. She persuades him to abandon his manager Haley and take on the management of Jerome Harris, an extremely wealthy and influential figure in the fight game with criminal ties. Realizing this is the only way he will get a shot at the title, Kelly agrees. His brother is so disgusted that he walks out. He reconnects with Midge's abandoned wife and convinces her to return to Chicago with him to help care for his aged and ailing mother.\n\nKelly takes the title and becomes a popular fan favorite because of his rise from humble beginnings. He soon becomes involved with the wife of his new manager, Palmer Harris, a sculptor. She falls in love with him and persuades Kelly to ask her husband for a divorce. Harris refuses and instead offers Kelly a large sum of money if he relinquishes his wife. Kelly agrees, leaving Palmer brokenhearted.\n\nHe has been fighting a number of second-rate challengers, but now he has agreed to fight Dunne, who has been making a comeback. Dunne is in good shape and Kelly quickly realizes he is going to lose unless he gets in top shape. He hires back his old manager, and Connie and Emma come back into the camp as well. Connie and Emma are now contemplating marriage, although Emma is still legally married to Midge. As they are breaking camp, Midge rapes Emma, just to show he can.\n\nKelly fights Dunne in the sporting event of the year. He knocks down the challenger in the first round. Dunne manages to get up and the balance of the fight shifts in his direction. He starts pounding Kelly, pummeling his face. Kelly's manager tries to throw in the towel, but Midge refuses and fights on, taking more punishment. After seeing Grace in the audience, Kelly, now enraged, rallies in the final round and knocks out Dunne. But he is seriously injured and dies in his locker room of a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nAfter delivering a favorable, but backhanded, eulogy to a reporter, Connie and Emma walk off into the darkness, now free to move forward with their lives.\n\nAs of 2018 Kirk Douglas is the film's last surviving cast member.\n\nThe film was shot in twenty days.\n\nRKO sued the filmmakers claiming similarities between this film and \"The Set Up\".\n\nWhen the film was released, Bosley Crowther, the film critic for \"The New York Times\", believed the drama was not exactly faithful to the original Lardner story, which had a very hard-edge. Still, he gave the boxing drama a positive review, and wrote, \"However, Director Mark Robson has covered up story weaknesses with a wealth of pictorial interests and exciting action of a graphic, colorful sort. His scenes in training gymnasiums, managers' offices and, of course, the big fight rings are strongly atmospheric and physically intense. Except that the fighting is more furious than one can credit, it is virtually all right. As the hero and \"Champion\", Kirk Douglas does a good, aggressive job, with a slight inclination to over-eagerness at times, which might amuse an old fight fan. Arthur Kennedy is dour as his crippled brother who distrusts the slaughterous sport, and Marilyn Maxwell, Ruth Roman and Lola Albright are attractive as the \"champ's\" various girls. Paul Stewart is most convincing as a quiet, hard-bitten manager. If one hasn't already seen the recently memorable \"Body and Soul\" which might have served as a model for \"Champion\", this is a stinging fight film to see. If one has seen that other, this will look a little pale.\"\n\nThe staff at \"Variety\" magazine gave the picture a good review and also noted the difference between the screenplay and the original story. They wrote, \"Adapted from a Ring Lardner short story of the same title, \"Champion\" is a stark, realistic study of the boxing rackets and the degeneracy of a prizefighter. Fight scenes, under Franz Planer's camera, have realism and impact. Unrelenting pace is set by the opening sequence. Cast, under Mark Robson's tight direction, is fine. Kirk Douglas is the boxer and he makes the character live. Second honors go jointly to Arthur Kennedy, the fighter's crippled brother, and Paul Stewart as the knowing manager.\"\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 92% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on thirteen reviews.\n\nWins\n\nNominations\n\nOthers\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\"Champion\" was presented on \"Screen Directors Playhouse\" on NBC on March 17, 1950, with Douglas reprising his role from the film.\n\n"}

The film stars Kurt Russell, Kris Kristofferson, Elisabeth Shue and Dakota Fanning. It is inspired by the true story of an injured Thoroughbred racehorse named Mariah's Storm. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2005 and was theatrically released on October 21, 2005 by DreamWorks Pictures. The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and earned $38 million on a $32 million budget. It also received a Critics' Choice Award nomination for Best Family Film.\n\nBen (Kurt Russell), a horse trainer who takes his work very seriously, neglects his precocious daughter while he pours his heart into the care of the horses that he trains.\n\nDetermined to make good on her father's overdue promise, Cale (Dakota Fanning) prods him to take her along to work and succeeds. One morning, a horse named Soñador falls during a race, injuring herself so badly that Ben's boss, Palmer, demands the horse be put down. Having Cale along, Ben instead strikes a bargain with Palmer and becomes the owner of the wounded horse. With no job and facing foreclosure on his property, he decides to breed Soñador.\n\nCale, having fallen in love at first sight with Soñador, begins to sneak out to the barn at night to see her. She also sneaks over to see her grandfather, 'Pop', Ben's dad (Kris Kristofferson), who loves teaching his granddaughter about horses.\n\nThey go to another farm to pick out a stallion to breed with Soñador, but the stud fee is too high. Ben's father gives Ben some money to use to breed, and Ben reluctantly takes it. But before they can breed, the vet tests Soñador and finds out she is unable to have a foal.\n\nAfter, Cale hears her father tell her mother, Lilly (Elisabeth Shue), that Soñador has ruined them because she cannot have a foal. Lily responds that Soñador is the best thing that has ever happened to them, alluding to the fact that Ben is finally spending much-needed time with Cale. Frustrated, Ben says that if Cale wasn't there the day when Soñador was hurt, he would have let her be put down.\n\nHurt after hearing the conversation, Cale sets out to run away and saddles Soñador. Not knowing of Cale's plan, Ben enters the barn. The door slams behind him, and a startled Soñador bolts out of the barn with Cale hanging on for dear life. Ben scrambles to his truck and sets out after them.\n\nThis incident begins to cement the newly forming bond between father and daughter. They realize that Soñador is very fast and decide to race her. Unfortunately, after the race she is claimed, and Cale is angry at her father for entering the horse in a claiming race.\n\nAt a parent-teacher night, Ben reads a story that Cale wrote about a king and his horse, and he realizes how much their family needs Soñador. He buys her back with money from his father. \nCale decides to race Soñador in the Breeders’ Cup Classic, with Manny, Ben's colleague, as the jockey. They train together and get into the race, which they win.\n\n\nThe movie is loosely inspired by the story of the mare Mariah's Storm. She was a promising filly who was being pointed towards the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies in 1993 but then broke her cannon bone (the incident is mentioned in the film by Sonador's veterinarian). She recovered and later won some graded stakes races. She started in the 1995 Breeders' Cup Distaff and finished ninth. She was owned by Thunderhead Farms and trained by Don Von Hemel. She is now known mostly for being the dam of Giant's Causeway. In the movie, when Cale and Ben go to Ashford Stud to check out the studs, the stallions they are naming, such as Fusaichi Pegasus, Giant's Causeway, Mariah's Storm, Johannesburg and Grand Slam, are real horses who actually stand at Ashford. However, the actual stallions were not used in filming. Stand-ins were placed in their stalls instead. In the scene where Sonya is considered for the Breeder's Cup, Prince Sadir says that his horse \"Rapid Cat is sired by Storm Cat, the best sire in the world.\" Coincidentally, Mariah's Storm (on whom Sonya is based) was bred to Storm Cat.\n\nWhile doing research in Kentucky, the director/writer came upon a vet who told him about a racehorse who miraculously made a comeback after a serious injury, and he loosely based the script on this story. Before being picked up by DreamWorks, the script was presented to Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros, but both declined. Director John Gatins was told that if he could get Dakota Fanning in the lead role his movie would get a green-light. He went to see Fanning's agent and finally got the young actress to sign on. The role of Cale Crane was originally written for a boy, and the role was changed specifically so that Dakota Fanning could play it. The first script that was sent to Fanning actually had the word \"boy\" in the character description.\n\nTo produce the soundtrack, an advance showing of this film was shown to a number of recording artists, who were then asked to submit ideas for theme songs. Bethany Dillon's song \"Dreamer\" was chosen out of all the submissions. After the movie, Kurt Russell bought Dakota Fanning a real Palomino horse, whom she named Goldie.\n\nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2005 and released theatrically on October 21, 2005 by DreamWorks Pictures. It was released on VHS and DVD on March 21, 2006; it was the last Dreamworks film released on VHS.\n\n\"Dreamer\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 64%, based on 117 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Though formulaic, this horse story's saving grace is its strong performances.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 59 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". According to CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a rare grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\"Dreamer\" opened in second place at the box office behind \"Doom\", with $9,178,233 earned for a $4,573 average from 2,007 theaters. In its second weekend, it held well with a 33.2% drop to fourth place with $6,132,856 earned for a $2,462 average from being expanded to 2,491 theaters and lifting its two-week total to $17,374,339. It held up even better in its third weekend, only slipping 21.8% to sixth place and $4,794,741 for a $1,832 average from being expanded to 2,617 theaters. In its fourth weekend, it once again held well with a 22.2% slide to $3,728,510 and ninth place, for a $1,363 average from being expanded to its widest release, 2,735 theaters.\n\nThe film closed on January 5, 2006, after 77 days of release and grossing $32,751,093 domestically along with an additional $5,990,639 overseas for a worldwide total of $38,741,732. Produced on a $32 million budget, the film performed average at the box office, as it barely recouped its budget.\n\n\n"}

The Gozo Stadium, which is located in Xewkija, seats only 1,644 people but its standing areas at each end of its main stand ensure that the stadium can hold up to approximately 3,800 people. Similar to Malta, the Gozo Stadium is the main venue of the local top division, the Gozo Football League First Division, and the finals of all cups organised by the Gozo Football Association are generally held at the stadium. \n\nThe stadium was erected in 1936 and as a commemoration of the Silver Jubilee of King George V, the stadium was named the Silver Jubilee Ground. The stadium, which originally comprised only what is now referred to as the Xewkija Stand, costed 819 pounds, 12 shillings and 3 pence to built. A number of amenities, namely a boundary wall around the ground, dressing rooms, toilets and a bar, were added two years later. \nIn 1975, the stadium was expanded through the construction of an opposite stand, commonly referred to as the Xaghra Stand, and in 1995 the surface of the pitch was converted to natural turf and the stadium was renamed to Gozo Stadium At that time, the stadium was rather unique in Gozo as all other pitches had sandy surfaces. The sandy surfaces have almost all gone now but the fact that these have been replaced with synthetic surf surfaces ensures that Gozo Stadium's distinction in being the only stadium in Gozo having a natural turf pitch remains intact to this day. \n\nIn January 2007, the stadium was illuminated by floodlights for the first time as the erection of a floodlight at each corner ensured that the Gozo Stadium could also host football matches after dawn as well. Three years after, and in anticipation of Gozo's hosting of the VIVA World Cup, the stadium was subject to another investment.. The project, which costed around €340k entailed the construction of a complex behind one of the goals. The complex includes offices, four dressing rooms, two rooms for the use of referees, new toilet facilities and a garage. In 2011, the stadium was improved through the laying of a new five-a-side pitch and the construction of a parking space catering for 75 vehicles..\n\nIn 2013, and with the UEFA European Under-17 Championship in the horizon, the Government allocated €500k to fund the improvement of football grounds around the island of Gozo. The Gozo Stadium was one of the beneficiaries as part of the budget was used to fund the development of further facilities at the Gozo Stadium, particularly a state-of-the art VIP Area at the enclosure.\n\nThe Gozo Stadium is located at Mgarr Road, the main road connecting Xewkija to Victoria. It comprises two stands on each side of the pitch. The enclosure, the larger of the two, is situated on Xewkija's side and, almost by default, is referred to as the Xewkija Side. The stand, which is sliced in two by the VIP Area, is all seated and covered under a roof. Moreover, a standing area together with a bar is located at the end of each side of the stand. Opposite to the Xewkija Side is the Xaghra Side. As suggestive by its name, it is located on Xaghra's side and aesthetically speaking the stand consists of a stand running alongside the pitch, with a bar located right at the middle. The Xaghra Side is not covered from the elements and is only opened when the stadium hosts important matches and hence hundreds are expected to turn up. Both stands are accessible from Mgarr Road.\n\nThe Gozo Stadium was one of the three stadiums used during the Maltese hosting of the 2014 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. The stadium hosted 4 group matches in all. \n\nAback of the Malta Football Association's decision to have a Gozitan side representing Malta during the 2013, 2015 and 2017 editions of the UEFA Regions Cup and consequent to UEFA's decision for Malta to host the group matches in which Gozo was drawn in all three editions, the Gozo Stadium also hosted the 9 matches played during the Intermediary Round of the three editions in question. \n\nUp to 2011, Gozo was also used to be represented in the Maltese football league system by Gozo FC. The highest point of the club's history was its promotion to the Maltese Premier League by winning the 1998/1999 edition of the Maltese First Division. All Gozo FC's home matches during their only season in the highest echelon of the Maltese football were played at the Gozo Stadium.\n\nThe Gozo Stadium was one of the two venues to host the 2010 edition of the Viva World Cup. Besides the opening ceremony, the stadium hosted five matches in all, namely three group stage matches, a semi-final and the final between Iraqi Kurdistan and the eventual winners Padania.\n\n\n"}

Havelock Park was originally in area but in 1905 the CMC purchased an additional for Rs 30,000. By 1907 Galle Face Green, Victoria Park (now known as Viharamahadevi Park) and the Havelock Town Park were adjudged as being the major \"green lungs\" of Colombo.\n\nDuring the early decades of the 19th Century, Havelock Park became the home of several sporting clubs, although one, the Havelock Golf Club, shifted to Buller’s Road (Bauddhaloka Mawatha) where the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall now stands.

{"id": "14656009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14656009", "title": "History of English amateur cricket", "text": "History of English amateur cricket\n\nCricket, and hence English amateur cricket, probably began in England during the medieval period but the earliest known reference concerns the game being played c.1550 by children on a plot of land at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, Surrey. It is generally believed that cricket was originally a children's game as it is not until the beginning of the 17th century that reports can be found of adult participation.\n\nOriginally, all cricketers were amateurs in the literal sense of the word. Village cricket developed through the 17th century and teams typically comprised players who were all resident in the same village or parish. There is no evidence of professionalism before the English Civil War or during the Commonwealth but legal cases of the period have shown that cricket was played jointly by gentry and workers.\n\nIn the great upsurge of sport after the Restoration in 1660, cricket flourished because so many people had encountered it as children, especially at school. Although the sport was popular, its evolution into a major sport was accelerated by gambling because, along with horse racing and prizefighting, cricket soon attracted the attention of those who were seeking to make wagers.\n\nTo boost their chances of winning, some gamblers formed their own county-class teams such as Kent and Surrey who played each other in 1709. Patrons like Edwin Stead, the Duke of Richmond and Sir William Gage captained their teams and it was gentlemen like these, and the friends whom they invited to play, who began cricket's amateur tradition, while some players were paid a fee for taking part and this was the beginning of professionalism. Thus, a Sussex team of the 1720s might be captained by Richmond and include not only additional gentlemen like Gage but also professionals like Thomas Waymark; and this was the pattern of first-class English teams for a period of 300 years from the 1660s to the 1960s. Waymark, for example, was employed by the Duke of Richmond as a groom and this became a common arrangement between patron and professional. Later in the 18th century, professionals like Edward \"Lumpy\" Stevens and John Minshull were employed by their patrons as gardeners or gamekeepers. But in the longer term, the professional became an employee of his club and the beginnings of this trend could be observed in the 1770s when Hambledon paid match fees to its players.\n\nThe original Lord's was opened in 1787 and was intended to be the private preserve of a gentlemen's club which soon reconstituted itself as Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Only a gentleman could become a member but the club from its very beginning employed or contracted professionals. Lord's immediately began to stage major matches and these attracted the crowds that some members had originally sought to avoid. MCC teams soon adopted the now age-old formula of \"gentlemen\" and \"players\" in the same team.\n\nThere are few 17th century references to cricket being played at or in the vicinity of schools, but the sport was played by pupils at Eton College and Winchester College by the time of the Commonwealth. There is a reference to the game at St Paul's School, London about 1665 concerning John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who studied there.\n\nIn his \"Social History of English Cricket\", Derek Birley comments that school cricket was \"alive and well during the interregnum\" (1649–1660) and speculates that the game \"must have been known to every schoolboy in the south-east\" of England. However, he doubts that the sport at this time was part of any school's curriculum. Apart from Eton and Westminster School, all schools in the 17th century had local intakes and no class segregation. Therefore, the sons of rich and poor families played together.\n\nIn 1706, William Goldwin (1682–1747) published his \"Musae Juveniles\", which included a Latin poem called \"In Certamen Pilae\" (On a Ball Game). This has 95 lines and is about a rural cricket match. Goldwin himself attended Eton and then graduated to King's College, Cambridge in 1700. It is almost certain that he encountered cricket at both establishments. There is a reference to cricket at Cambridge University in 1710 while Samuel Johnson recorded that he played cricket at Oxford University in 1729. In 1760, the Reverend James Woodforde played for \"the Winchester against the Eaton (\"sic\")\" at Oxford.\n\nHorace Walpole entered Eton in 1726 and later wrote that \"playing cricket as well as thrashing bargemen was common\". The Sackville family which produced the Dukes of Dorset, most notably the 3rd Duke, sent its sons to Westminster, the 1st Duke studying there at the end of the 17th century; and it was through playing cricket at school that the game became a Sackville family tradition.\n\nThe spread of cricket to the northern counties by 1750 was partly due to \"its transmission by interested clergy, schoolmasters and others educated at southern boarding schools\". In the middle part of the 18th century, games involving teams of \"alumni\" became popular. These fixtures ranged from a team of Old Etonians playing the Gentlemen of England in 1751 to a game at the newly opened Lord's Old Ground in 1788 which was entitled \"Gentlemen Educated at Eton \"versus\" The Rest of the Schools\". The first school cricket match which has been recorded was in 1794 between Westminster School and Charterhouse School with pupils playing as City of London and City of Westminster at Lords Old Ground. Westminster School played its games at Tothill Fields, which was where Vincent Square now stands. It is known to have played matches against Eton in 1792 and 1796.\n\nBirley recorded that the \"sharpest rivalry\" in the middle to late 18th century was between old boys of Eton and Westminster, as these were the two oldest public schools. Notable cricketing patrons who attended those schools include the 3rd Duke of Dorset (Winchester), the 4th Earl of Tankerville and the 9th Earl of Winchilsea (both Eton). Their fellow patron Sir Horatio Mann attended Charterhouse School, an indication that cricket was gaining acceptance at many other schools. By 1800, it was firmly established in all public and most grammar schools.\n\nThe most important of these \"many other schools\" was Harrow, which would develop a great cricketing tradition during the 19th century and produce numerous quality players. Harrow had formerly been a grammar school but by the end of the 18th century it had become a public school. Cricket was welcomed at Harrow as elsewhere because it was seen as a useful method for keeping the boys occupied and out of mischief, this despite its strong gambling associations.\n\nEton and Harrow definitely played each other in 1805 and there is evidence suggesting a game in 1804, perhaps sooner. The 1805 Eton v Harrow game at Lord's seems to have been organised by the boys themselves, not by the schools, and Lord Byron, who played for Harrow, is believed to have hired the venue. These two schools eventually developed a fierce rivalry that has become the schools cricket equivalent of Cambridge v Oxford or Yorkshire v Lancashire, but they did not meet again until 1818 (twice) and 1822; after that, the fixture has occurred annually except for 1829–1831, 1856 and in wartime. James Pycroft in \"The Cricket Field\" commented on the betting at the 1825 game but, by 1833, the match had become a social highlight and \"The Times\" noted \"upwards of thirty carriages containing ladies\". Also by this time, the main public schools had grouped themselves into an elite circle and all other schools were decidedly viewed as second class by comparison. The elite were Charterhouse, Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Westminster and Winchester.\n\nAmong prominent amateurs of the Napoleonic period, E. H. Budd was an Etonian and William Ward was a Wykehamist (i.e., a Winchester pupil). Other noted \"old boys\" were Edward Grimston, Charles Harenc, Charles Wordsworth (all Harrow), John Kirwan, Herbert Jenner (both Eton) and William Meyrick (Winchester).\n\nWard's old school of Winchester was the main challenger to Eton and Harrow. Harrow v Winchester was first played in 1825 and Eton v Winchester in 1826. Winchester won both of those games convincingly. H. S. Altham records that \"there was a great public school festival at Lord's until its demise in 1854\" which involved Eton, Harrow and Winchester. Meanwhile, of 234 \"blues\" awarded by Cambridge and Oxford from 1827 to 1854, 140 went to pupils of these three schools.\n\nAccording to Pycroft, Winchester had the best players in the 1820s and 1830s for, at Oxford, their former pupils challenged and defeated the rest of the university and they also won a match against the combined universities at Lord's. Six Wykehamists played in the inaugural varsity match in 1827 but the main participants in this were Charles Wordsworth of Harrow and Herbert Jenner of Eton. Charles Harenc of Harrow became the best amateur bowler of the 1830s. Notable Etonians of the time included Harvey Fellows and the fearsome pace bowler Walter Marcon.\n\nThe 1820s and 1830s saw the beginning of \"Muscular Christianity\" in the public schools. Dr Thomas Arnold at Rugby is often considered the \"founder\" of this movement but in terms of cricket it was at Winchester that the best effect was achieved, especially in their athletic approach to fielding. Although this was hyped as something new, there are plenty of references to outstanding athletic fielders in the 18th century such as Thomas Waymark, John Small, Tom Taylor and William Yalden.\n\nThe earliest references to cricket at Rugby School and Charterhouse date from the 1820s. Other schools that gained mention in the 19th century include Addiscombe Military Seminary, Cheltenham College, Clifton College, Malvern College, Marlborough College, Merchant Taylors' School, Repton School, Shrewsbury School, Tonbridge School, Uppingham School, Wellington and Whitgift School.\n\nThe fixture that became the definitive expression of a cricketing class divide was first contested in 1806 when the two teams met twice. Even then, the amateurs realised they were at a real disadvantage and so their team in the inaugural match at Lord's included two of the greatest professional players, William Beldham and William Lambert as \"given men\". Lambert made 57 out of 195 and, given the support he received from T. A. Smith, who scored 48, his contribution ensured that the Gentlemen won by an innings and 14 runs. The Gentlemen team was actually quite good as it also included Beauclerk, John Willes, Edward Bligh, George Leycester and Arthur Upton. In the second match, Beldham went back to the Players and only Lambert was a given man. Lambert again had an outstanding game and the Gentlemen won by 82 runs, though it was Beauclerk's first innings score of 58 from only 96 that was decisive.\n\nThe fixture was tried again in 1819 without much success and then, to quote Birley, it \"struggled on\". One of the least auspicious occasions was in 1821 when the Gentlemen \"gave up\" after they had scored only 60 and the Players had reached 270–6. Birley states that this was a Coronation Match to celebrate the accession of the much-maligned King George IV and that \"it was a suitably murky affair!\"\n\nIn 1822, the Gentlemen did manage to win on level terms thanks to their triumvirate of great batsmen: Beauclerk, Budd and Ward. Budd scored 69 out of 138 in the first innings; Beauclerk and Ward built an unbeaten partnership in the second to secure the six wicket win; and really the Players were rather let down by their batting. Having good batsmen and ordinary bowlers was to become a Gentlemen tendency. The Players on the other hand were usually strong in bowling and generally good in batting.\n\nFrom 1824 to 1837, the fixture was usually an odds match, the Gentlemen having as many as 18 in 1836. In two matches, the Players were handicapped by different stump lengths. In 1835, the Gents had Sam Redgate as a given man and he caused a stir by clean bowling Fuller Pilch twice for nought. In 1836, the great Alfred Mynn played for the Gents for the first time along with Alfred \"Dandy\" Lowth, another noted speed merchant even though he was still a 17-year-old Winchester school boy; his promising career was cut short due to failing eyesight.\n\nBy 1841, the fixture was in disrepute and MCC refused to organise it. It was only through the efforts of C. G. Taylor and the Hon. F. Ponsonby that the game could take place. They opened a subscription list to avert its collapse.\n\nThe first University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford University took place at Lord's on 4 June 1827. The result was a draw. The captains were Charles Wordsworth (Oxford) and Herbert Jenner (Cambridge). It became an annual fixture in 1838.\n\nCambridge and Oxford were the only English universities until 1828, when the first college at London University was founded. Durham University was the fourth in 1832 and the first \"redbrick\" was Owens College at Manchester in 1851.\n\nAbout the early days of the two university clubs, H. S. Altham (himself an Oxford \"blue\") states that OUCC played on \"that part of Cowley Common that was called the Magdalen Ground, so-called because it had been appropriated by the Magdalen College Choir School, whose headmaster made it over\" (to OUCC). Cowley Common is in fact some distance from the University itself and so \"the cricketers used to enjoy a ride out across the fences!\" OUCC moved to The Parks, its present venue, in 1881.\n\nAltham says that CUCC began at a huge public area called Parker's Piece but then became tenants at Fenner's in 1846. The club secured the lease of Fenner's in 1873. Francis Fenner had been a bowler with the Cambridge Town Club (CTC) and had acquired his land in 1846, perhaps for the express purpose of leasing it to CUCC. CTC and the subsequent Cambridgeshire CCC also played on Parker's Piece.\n\nPlaying standards at the two university clubs were ordinary until the 1860s. Altham admits that many CUCC and OUCC players were selected for the Gentlemen but points out that this owed \"less to the strength of the universities than to the weakness of amateur cricket as a whole\".\n\nNoted CUCC players of the period include: C. G. Taylor; Robert Broughton, who was an outstanding cover point; George Boudier; Robert T. King, an all-rounder who had an outstanding season in 1849; Hon. F. Ponsonby; Joseph McCormick; Joseph Makinson, who played for Lancashire CCC; George Edward Cotterill; Herbert Marshall; Arthur Daniel; Hon. C. G. Lyttelton; Edward Sayres; John Kirwan; Edward Blore; Robert Lang.\n\nNoted OUCC players of the period include: Hon. Robert Grimston; Villiers Smith; Charles Coleridge; Reginald Hankey; Charlton Lane; the twins Arthur and Alfred Payne; Walter Fellows; Richard Mitchell, an outstanding batsman at Oxford who went on to greater things as coach at Eton in the 1870s; Alfred Lowth; George B. Lee; Henry Moberly; Charles Willis; Gerald Yonge; C. D. B. Marsham.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, William Clarke's All-England Eleven (AEE) was a highly successful all-professional venture which did much to popularise the game. The earliest overseas tours were also all-professional affairs. It was not long before amateurs became involved in the AEE.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This method of medical ultrasound therapy can be used for various types of pain relief and physical therapy.\n\nIn physics, the term \"ultrasound\" applies to all acoustic energy with a frequency above the audible range of human hearing. The audible range of sound is 20 hertz – 20 kilohertz. Ultrasound frequency is greater than 20 kilohertz.\n\nUltrasound energy is transferred based on the frequency and power output of the ultrasonic waves that an ultrasound machine or device creates. Home ultrasound machines and doctor's office machines both operate between 1 and 5 megahertz, however, home machines utilize pulsed ultrasonic waves while professional ultrasound machines in a doctor's office use continuous waves.\n\nTypically, when using a home ultrasound machine, you will use it more frequently than if you were to have ultrasound treatments at a therapist's office, but the end results are the same as if using a continuous wave machine less frequently. Treatments towards a pre-workout in deep muscles and relieving tendons such as arthritis, frozen shoulder, strains, and sprains. \n\nHome ultrasound machines may have several benefits: long-term cost savings, portable physical therapy treatment, long-term pain relief for multiple symptoms, possible decrease in healing time, and can reduce chronic inflammation. Increase in knee range of motion after use for an injury's such as Osteoarthritis OA, which is the most common joint disorder and incidence increases with age. treatment of OA aims to reduce joint pain and stiffness, preserve and improve the joint mobility. The benefits have improvements for pain, function, and quality of life scales were effected by ultrasounds. \n\nHome ultrasound machines operate within the range of frequencies of therapeutic ultrasound, as opposed to the more commonly known diagnostic ultrasound, or Diagnostic sonography. Typical diagnostic ultrasound machines operate in the frequency range of 2-18 megahertz, whereas home ultrasound machines and therapeutic ultrasound machines operate in the frequency range of .7-3.3 megahertz. Diagnostic sonography is typically used to create an audio \"image\", such as during pregnancy to visualize the developing baby.\n\nPhonophoresis, also known as sonophoresis, is the use of ultrasound to enhance the delivery of topically applied drugs. Home ultrasound allows the application of topically applied analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents through the therapeutic application of ultrasound. It is widely used in hospitals to deliver drugs through the skin. Pharmacists compound the drugs by mixing them with a coupling agent (gel, cream, ointment) that transfers ultrasonic energy from the ultrasound transducer to the skin. The ultrasound potentially enhances drug transport by cavitation, microstreaming, and heating.\n\nThe ultrasonic wavelengths create an audio \"image\" as the machine therapeutically shows a baby growth inside the genetic mother's uterus. They serve as a monitor and have a validation of the predictions of ovulation and the IUI Intrauterine insemination cycles.\n\nThere are home ultrasounds available for purchase prices ranging from 46.00 U.S. dollars to 5,000.00. Most popular home ultrasound buys are Roscoe Medical US 1000 portable ultrasound, SonoScape A6, Acclaim US PRO 2000, UltraTENS, and dynatron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5241650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5241650", "title": "Icepick grip", "text": "Icepick grip\n\nThe icepick grip, otherwise known as the \"reverse grip\", is a technique used in close range knifefighting, in which the blade protrudes from the bottom of the hand, rather than the top (\"natural\" or \"hammer\" grip) of the closed fist, resembling the way one would normally use an icepick for its intended use; colloquially referred to as the \"stabbing\" grip.\n\nUp until the late 1980s, the consensus amongst most martial arts experts was that the icepick grip was the mark of an amateur, and that one who chose to attack using such a grip was easily disarmed. This argument was not entirely without merit, as many impulsive and unskilled knife attacks feature a wild downward thrust in which the knife is gripped in this manner. However, many pragmatic martial artists who had actually been attacked with knives (such as James Keating) became increasingly vocal in their assertion that not only is it extremely dangerous for an unarmed martial artist to attempt to disarm a knifefighter, but in the hands of a reasonably proficient fighter (such as Eskrima practitioners), a knife held in this fashion is remarkably fluid and can deliver multiple cuts from a variety of angles simply by manipulating the wrist. Such flexibility of technique make it extremely dangerous to attempt to immobilize the knife hand by grasping the wrist, as it can quickly circle around and do damage to tendons, nerves, or blood vessels.\n\nThis grip is best implemented with a double-edged knife (dagger). If a single-edged knife is used, the edge should be facing outwards, away from the knifefighter and towards the target. In the event that a hiltless (\"sans\" crossguard) knife is used (e.g. the balisong or sgian dubh), it is advised that one \"cap\" the pommel with one's thumb to prevent slippage of one's hand up onto the blade upon impact with a solid object (e.g. bone) -- although, as with the much touted \"sabre\" and \"commando\" grips, failure to securely wrap the thumb around the grip will result in a greatly increased likelihood of droppage.\n"}

Geelong went into the match as the favourites; they were the defending premiers, and had lost only one match for the entire season; however, Hawthorn prevailed by 26 points to claim its 10th premiership. Ahead of the teams' first round meeting at the start of the 2009 season, then-Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett publicly questioned Geelong's mental drive to defeat Hawthorn.\nAdditionally, following the upset Grand Final loss, Geelong players made a private pact, which was later made public by Paul Chapman, to never again lose to Hawthorn. Following Kennett's comments, Geelong won the match in Round 1, 2009, and proceeded to defeat Hawthorn in eleven successive matches: a run that included a number of remarkable games. Kennett's demeaning comments in 2009 came to be seen as the initiating event of a curse on Hawthorn, dubbed by fans and media as the \"Kennett curse\". Kennett himself (who stepped down from the Hawthorn presidency in 2011) said in 2013 that while he was not proud of what he had said, he did not wish he could take it back. The curse ended when Hawthorn defeated Geelong in the 2013 First Preliminary Final, after Kennett's reign as Hawthorn president had ended, knocking Geelong out of the finals (Hawthorn won the Grand Final the next week to claim the Premiership).\n\nOver the period of the curse, the rivalry between the clubs remained strong. All matches were played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, drew at least 63,000 spectators, and although Geelong won all eleven matches, most matches were close and/or involved one team coming from a long way behind. Nine of the eleven matches were decided by ten points or less, and five by less than a goal (six points), with two decided by kicks after the final siren: Round 17, 2009, with a behind to Jimmy Bartel; and Round 19, 2012, with a goal to Tom Hawkins. The Cats' 11-match winning streak against the Hawks is the longest by any team following a VFL/AFL Grand Final loss to their opponent.\nSource: Footy Wire\n\nThe losing streak ended as follows:\n\nThe curse looked to continue with Geelong leading by 19 points midway through the final quarter, but Hawthorn rallied and kicked three goals and seven behinds to Geelong's solitary point to overrun the Cats by 5 points. Paul Chapman, who earlier had publicised the Geelong players' pact never to lose to Hawthorn, missed the preliminary final due to suspension. He was then traded to Essendon at the end of the season.\n\n\n"}

They began in 1887 after separating from the Lent Bumps, the equivalent bumping races held at the end of February or start of March. Prior to the separation there had been a single set of annual bumps dating from its inception in 1827. The races are open to all college boat clubs from the University of Cambridge, the University Medical and Veterinary Schools and Anglia Ruskin Boat Club. The May Bumps takes place over four days (Wednesday to Saturday) in mid-June and is run as a bumps race.\n\nThe most recent in the series was the May Bumps 2018, which ran from 13 June 2018 until 16 June 2018.\nThe races are run in divisions, each containing 17 crews. The number of crews in each bottom division varies yearly depending on new entrants. Each crew contains 8 rowers and one coxswain. A total of 154 crews took part in 2014, totalling around 1390 participants. There are currently 6 divisions for men's crews (referred to as M1, M2...M6) and 4 divisions for women's crews (similarly W1-W4). The divisions represent a total race order with Division 1 at the top. The ultimate aim is to try and finish \"Head of the River\" (also said as gaining the 'Headship'), i.e. 1st position in division 1. \n\nAt the start, signalled by a cannon, each crew is separated by a distance of about 1½ boat lengths (approximately 30m or 90'). Once the race has begun, a crew must attempt to catch up with the crew ahead of it and \"bump\" (physically touch or overtake) it before the crew behind does the same to them. A crew which bumps or is bumped must pull to the side of the river to allow all the other crews to continue racing. If a crew is able to catch and bump the boat which started 3 places in front of it, after the two in front have already bumped out, the crew is said to have \"over-bumped\". A crew which neither bumps a crew ahead nor is bumped by a crew behind before crossing the finishing post is said to have \"rowed over\". \n\nAfter the race, any crew which bumps or over-bumps swaps places with the crew that it has bumped for the following day's racing. A crew which rows over stays in the same position. Crews finishing at the top of a division also :at the bottom of the next division, as the \"sandwich boat\", in an attempt to try to move up into the next division. The process is repeated over four days, allowing crews to move up or down several places in the overall order of boats. The finishing order of one year's May Bumps are then used as the starting order of the following year's races.\n\nNB. May Bumps were cancelled between 1915 and 1918, and in 1940 due to war. Prior to 1946 were two separate rowing clubs: 1st Trinity and 3rd Trinity, hence both separate and combined titles.\n\nNB. The Women's May Bumps were rowed in coxed-fours between 1974 and 1989, changing to coxed-eights from 1990 onwards. A new start order was used for the women's 1990 races.\n\nSixteen boats have been head of the river.\nNB. Prior to 1946 were two separate rowing clubs: 1st Trinity and 3rd Trinity, hence both separate and combined titles.\n\nCCAT, Christ's, Clare Hall, Corpus Christi, Darwin, Girton, Homerton, Hughes Hall, King's, Magdalene, Peterhouse, Robinson, St. Catharine's, Selwyn, Sidney Sussex, St Edmund's, Wolfson, Addenbrooke's and the Veterinary School are the regular entrants never to have finished Head of the River for either the men's or women's events.\n\nFour boat 'awards' are informally/formally recognised by the individual college boat clubs that take part in the Cambridge May Bumps, these accolades are awarded as follows:\n\n\nThe Pegasus Cup is a Cambridge rowing prize first awarded in 2006. It was donated by Milton Brewery and will be awarded annually to the most successful college boat club competing in the Cambridge May Bumping Races.

A common tongue-in-cheek reference to having seats at the upper tiers of a stadium is \"sitting in the nosebleed section\" or \"nosebleed seats\". The reference alludes to the propensity for nasal hemorrhage at high altitudes, usually owing to lower barometric pressure.\n\nThe origin of the expression may have been the 1970s television series \"Happy Days\". Toward the end of one episode, Richie Cunningham (played by Ron Howard) and all his friends got to go to the JF&F concert, but the tickets were for seats way up top. Fonzie (played by Henry Winkler) uttered the words, \"A guy could get a nosebleed up here\". This seems to be the first documented popular use associating \"nosebleed\" with the way-up-high cheap seats at a spectator event.\n\nTom Petty's song \"Money Becomes King\" refers to a performer's original fans having to sit \"way up in the nosebleeds\".\n\nIn the 109th episode of NBC sitcom Seinfeld (The Face Painter), on being offered tickets for the Stanley Cup playoff game between the New York Rangers and the New Jersey Devils by Alec Berg, Jerry Seinfeld is told \"If you don't mind the nose bleed section, they're yours\". \n\nIn episode 22 of the first season of the NBC series Friday Night Lights, running back Timothy Riggins after passing on a set of tickets to the Texas State Championship to a young family, the mother of whom he has been romantically acquainted, forgets that the tickets were originally promised to his former love interest Tyra Collette. Being as she made the trip to Dallas he provides her with four players' tickets with the caveat that \"those are nosebleeds\".\n\nThe Australian hip hop group Hilltop Hoods have a song titled \"The Nosebleed Section\". In the song, the meaning of nosebleed section is reversed to mean the front row. This is because when a person has a nosebleed, they are often instructed (incorrectly) to keep their head back and look straight up - as people are forced to do in the front row of a high-stage show.\n\nThe band Imagine Dragons also have cited the expression with the meaning of a concert section in their song \"Thunder\". In the verse \"Now I'm smiling from the stage, while you were clapping in the nosebleeds\" they show they are the successful ones, while people who criticized them at an early age are now admiring them.\n\nAmerican rapper Post Malone used the expression in his song “White Iverson”. He says in his verse “Bitch I'm smiling, bet you see me from the nosebleeds”. This line refers to his happiness performing and the fact that people know him.\n\nAmerican rapper Kanye West uses this same expression in Gucci Mane's song \"P**** Print\" in which he is featured. \"I can take you from nose bleeds to the floor seats\" This line refers to the girls that he used to bang before he got with Kim Kardashian in which he would get all the p**** he wants in exchange for floor seats.\n\n"}

It is part of the Hua Mak Sports Complex, and is located in Hua Mak Subdistrict, Bang Kapi, Bangkok. It officially opened in 1998.\n\nIt was first used for the 1998 Asian Games in 1998 and 1999 ASEAN University Games in 1999. Since then, it has been used for many international matches and football tournaments. Most notably, for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. Thai club sides have also used the stadium when playing in continental cup competitions. Krung Thai Bank FC (now Bangkok Glass FC) used it for AFC Champions League matches, and PEA FC and Chonburi FC have recently used it in the AFC Cup. Aside from football, it has been used for athletics, pop concerts and political rallies.\n\nRajamangala Stadium was designed by the Faculty of Architecture at Chulalongkorn University. The main material used in construction was concrete and therefore, though the stadium is impressive and imposing, it could never be described as beautiful. However, it is undoubtedly dramatic. The stands rise and fall like a giant, exaggerated version of Huddersfield's Galpharm Stadium. At each end are quite narrow tiers of seats but the tiers rise and rise as they move round the sides until they peak level with the half-way line. From an aesthetic point of view, the stadium is best viewed from a distance, preferably from the air, where the elliptical shape of the side tribunes seems particularly pronounced.\n\nThe aforementioned side tribunes are designated 'East' and 'West'. 'East' is the uncovered popular side; 'West' is the covered side where the more expensive seats are. The two ends are designated 'North' and 'South'. 'North' is the more popular of the two. It's where the more vocal and colourful elements of the Thai support congregate.\n\nThe capacity of the stadium is 65,000. When the stadium first opened the capacity was 80,000. But plastic seats were installed on the North, South and East sides, where previously there had been bare concrete steps, in readiness for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup.\n\nThe stadium is not served by public transport which has always been a source of frustration for fans. No Bangkok Skytrains, subway-trains or normal overground trains stop anywhere near the stadium (unlike at the National Stadium, which is served by the Skytrain - National Stadium BTS station). However, there are buses and taxis which pass fairly close to the stadium. In 2010 Airport Rail Link was completed which means that the stadium is served by the City Line at - Ramkhamhaeng Station. From 2022 MRT Orange Line will be open and Rajamangala Stadium Station will be located in front of the stadium.\n\nThe stadium hosted the 2012 Race of Champions.\n\nOn 24 November 2013, a crowd estimated at 100,000 joined the rally around Bangkok's Democracy Monument in an anti-government protest, according to the Democrat Party, as pro-government red shirts gathered at Rajamangala Sports Stadium.\n\nOther stadiums in Bangkok include the Thai Army Sports Stadium, the Thai-Japanese Stadium and Chulalongkorn University Stadium.\n\n\n\nThe stadium has hosting several international FIFA matches. Here is a list of the most important international matches held at the Rajamangala Stadium.\n\n\n"}

Those horses live in mountains owned by the villages (a form of property derived from the Suevi, around 8th century) and have several owners (private owners, the parish or the village), each year the foal are marked and the adults shaved and deloused, and then freed again to the mountains.\n\nThe best known is the \"Rapa das Bestas\" of Sabucedo, in the city hall of A Estrada, which lasts three days: the First Saturday, Sunday and Monday in July.

{"id": "5087923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5087923", "title": "Rope climbing", "text": "Rope climbing\n\nRope climbing is a sport in which competitors attempt to climb up a suspended vertical rope using only their hands. Rope climbing is practiced regularly at the World Police and Fire Games, and is enjoying a resurgence in France, where competitions are held in shopping centers. Also, enthusiasts in the Czech Republic resurrected the sport in 1993, and hold local and national competitions.\n\nThis was an Olympic gymnastic event at one time, but was removed from that venue after the 1932 games. In the United States, competitive climbing on both 20 ft and 25 ft, natural fiber ropes was sanctioned by both the AAU and the NCAA until the early 1960s, when these organizations dropped the events. As a result, intercollegiate competition in the U.S. disappeared at this time. In Olympic games held in the U.S., competitors climbed a 25 ft (7.62m) rope, but when post-1896 games were held in Europe, an 8 m (26.3 ft) rope was used. In almost all contests, athletes climbed for speed, starting from a seated position on the floor and using only the hands and arms. Kicking the legs in a kind of \"stride\" was normally permitted. However, at the 1896 Olympic games, competitors were ranked by both time and style (holding an L-position) on a rope so long (15 meters) that some climbers did not reach the top and were therefore excluded. In all succeeding Olympics through the 1932 games, competitors were judged strictly by time of ascent on a shorter rope.\n\nAt the top of the climb, there was a circular \"tambourine\" with lampblack on its underside, which the climber touched. Several timers with stop watches timed the climb, and an acceptable official time was then agreed upon. Before the event expired in America, an electronic means of timing the climb was developed, but this was an insufficient reason to continue an activity conducted at gymnastic meets that many artistic gymnasts thought should have been relegated to the track and field arena. The world record for the 20 ft. climb was 2.8 seconds, first achieved by the American Don Perry in the 1950s.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1674234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1674234", "title": "Soldier Hollow", "text": "Soldier Hollow\n\nSoldier Hollow is a cross-country ski resort located southeast of Salt Lake City in Wasatch Mountain State Park, Utah, United States. The resort was created for the 2002 Winter Olympics, and during the games it hosted the biathlon, cross-country skiing and the cross country skiing portion of the Nordic combined events. Since hosting the Olympics, it has been developed as a cross-country skiing, tubing, and snowshoeing resort, while featuring mountain biking and golfing in the summer. On May 1, 2016, the venue operation contract transferred from the Soldier Hollow Legacy Foundation to the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation, which owns and operates several Olympic and Paralympic legacy venues elsewhere in the state.\n\nSoldier Hollow is located in the southeastern-most part of Wasatch Mountain State Park, a nature preserve created in 1961, which became a state park in 1968. Soldier Hollow's location within the state park did not carry a name until Olympic organizers coined it Soldier Hollow. This name was chosen because of its proximity to Soldier Springs, a summer campsite used by Ute Indians, U.S. Army surveyors of the 1850's and others. Prior to becoming a state park certain locations within the park were used for farming and grazing activities, while much of the remainder was used recreationally by locals. In the last quarter of the 20th century the state park service had been approached by private developers hoping to build luxury hotels, golf courses and other attractions within the park, but none of these plans ever came to fruition.\n\nThe Soldier Hollow venue was one of only three which was built and designed by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) specifically for the 2002 Winter Olympics; with the others being the Utah Olympic Park and Utah Olympic Oval. The Soldier Hollow location was chosen by SLOC as an Olympic venue in October 1997, over several other possible locations including Sherwood Hills near Logan, Utah. Preliminary work began soon after the venue site was chosen, but major construction didn't start until 1999. Work at the venue had been completed enough (80% complete) to host its first major event, U.S. Cross Country Championships, on January 8, 2000. Construction on the venue's day lodge began with a groundbreaking ceremony on July 5, 2000. The lodge was completed in December 2000 and dedicated on January 5, 2001. The venue cost SLOC $22 million USD to construct.\n\nDuring the 2002 games Soldier Hollow hosted the biathlon, cross-country skiing, and Nordic combined events. The venue itself hosted 64,160 biathlon spectators, 99,320 cross-country spectators, and 1,794 Nordic combined spectators during these events. During the 2002 Winter Paralympics the venue hosted the biathlon and cross-country events.\n\nSoldier Hollow was the furthest venue from Salt Lake City with an estimated drive time of 2-2.5 hours from downtown during the games. Because of this distance from any large population centers, a special \"Western Experience\" was created at the venue's spectator plaza to give visitors activities to do between competitions. The Western Experience included music and entertainment, a mountain rendezvous, pioneer reenactments, cowboy camps, wild mustang exhibit and American Indian displays, along with concession stands.\n\nIn order to help cut down on vehicle traffic in the local canyons during the games, and to give spectators a unique experience, SLOC reached an agreement with the historic Heber Valley Railroad to transport spectators to the Soldier Hollow venue. A special station was constructed along the railroad tracks near the venue which would allow for two to four trains, carrying 200 passengers each, per day. The Heber Valley Railroad's numbers 618 and 75 steam-engines, were joined by the Nevada Northern Railway Museum's number 93 steam-engine, in pulling eight-car trains full of passengers, to the Soldier Hollow depot where they disembarked and continued to the venue entrance on a horse-drawn sleigh.\n\nThe resort has been developed as a cross-country skiing, tubing, and snowshoeing resort with nearby horse-pulled sleigh riding during the winter months, while featuring mountain biking, golfing, a popular music festival and an international sheepdog competition in the summer. It is owned by the State of Utah and part of Wasatch Mountain State Park. The Division of State Parks and Recreation contracted management of the venue to a non-profit foundation. \n\nThe Wasatch Mountain Music Festival will be held at Soldier Hollow on July 14 - 16, 2017. Under the direction and management of Vibrant America and the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation, this festival of Americana music - bluegrass, country, Texas swing, folk, gypsy jazz - has an ideal setting within a Wasatch Mountain cove. \n\nThe large grassy staging area has two stages for non-stop music with a talented and diverse lineup of national recording artists and favorite local performers. \n\nThere are overnight camping spaces, vendor booths and food court, family hiking or biking trails, and nearby horseback riding or covered wagon rides, along with a pioneer living history encampment with children activities. The Heber Valley Railroad has scheduled a special \"music train\" to bring patrons to the event.\n\nWith a mission to educate as well as entertain, the Wasatch Mountain Music Festival will offer workshops from professionals, singer/songwriter showcases, music activities for children and opportunities for all musicians to jam and build relationships.\n\nThe site is also home to the Soldier Hollow Classic Sheepdog Championship and Festival, held on Labor Day weekend each year. Called the \"world's foremost sheepdog trial\" with some 28,000 people in attendance, the event will be four day event held September 1-4, 2017.\n\n"}
