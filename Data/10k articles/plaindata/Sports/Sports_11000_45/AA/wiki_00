In Greek, \"dia dora\" means \"by means of gifts\" which was appropriate, but probably not the origin of his friend's suggestion. More likely, it came from the name given by the Greeks of Byzantium to the Dalmatian town of Zadar. Originally called \"de ladera\" or \"from Zadar,\" it was mistakenly copied and translated from Dalmatian to Latin, becoming, along the way \"Diadora.\"\n\nDanieli, helped by his wife, managed to successfully launch his first product, mountain climbing boots. During the 1950s, a reputation for excellence and quality helped the company grow and become a familiar name throughout the Italian market.\n\nDuring the economic boom of the 1960s, people began to enjoy prosperity and increased recreation. Skiing became popular and Danieli once again met the needs of the market by manufacturing ski boots and the first apres-ski boots.\n\nNext, Diadora introduced running shoes and shortly thereafter, tennis shoes. With the 1970s came a young generation whose explosive interest in athletics initiated a boom in the sporting goods industry. Based originally on the renowned Italian artisan techniques, Diadora's shoes became more and more technologically advanced, thanks to cooperation from champions such as Guillermo Vilas, Martin Mulligan and Björn Borg.\n\nThe mid-'70s also marked Diadora's entry into the football category, aided by Roberto Bettega, who both provided invaluable consulting information. Diadora America is the #3 brand in the market share in football (soccer). AC Milan striker Marco van Basten became the face of the company in the late 1980s, and launched his own personalized football boots, the San Siro Van Basten.\n\nDiadora had and currently have a number of other high-profile football players under their sponsorship such as; George Weah, Roberto Baggio, Giuseppe Signori, Francesco Totti, Roy Keane and Antonio Cassano.\n\nOn 30 June 1998, Invicta, an outdoor athletics equipment company, was acquired by Diadora.\n\nIn 2007, Diadora signed a contract with football club NK Dinamo Zagreb, Croatia. Sheffield Wednesday F.C. wore kits for several seasons in the mid 2000s. Maccabi Netanya and Beitar Jerusalem also wore kits for several seasons in the mid to late 2000s. In 2016, Diadora signed contracts with FK Željezničar and Collingwood Magpies Netball.\n\nIn 2008, Diadora SpA signed a joint venture with Win Hanverky Holdings Limited forming a new company called Winor International Company Limited that owns the trademark \"DIADORA\" in China, Hong Kong, and Macau and will manufacture, design, promote, distribute, and sell products bearing the \"DIADORA\" in those countries.\n\nIn June 2009, Diadora reached an agreement with Italian shoe-making company Geox's founder and chairman Mario Moretti Polegato to buy its assets through his family's investment arm, LIR.\n\n\n"}

Attempts to revolutionize tennis officiating and the judging of calls in the sport began in the early 1970s and has resulted in the design, development and prototyping of several computerized, electronic line-judge devices. The methods have been based upon the use of pressure sensors, sensors to detect magnetized or electrically conductive tennis balls, infrared laser beams, and most recently video cameras.\n\nThe first successful public demonstration of a computerized device to make automated line calls at a professional tennis tournament was in 1974. (The Electroline-control computer pictured at the right). This original tennis electronic line judge device, invented by Geoffrey Grant, an avid tennis player, and Robert Nicks, an electronics engineer, was used in the championship finals of both the Men’s World Championship Tennis in Dallas in May, 1974 and the Ladies’ Virginia Slims tour in Los Angeles. Although the Grant-Nicks pressure sensor based system was given rave reviews in the press at its introduction and was issued with a USPTO patent, the product was never commercialized.\nThis inaugural electronic line-judge device worked on a principle of large, thin mylar conductive plastic pressure sensors beneath the surface of a carpet court. It was able to distinguish between a foot and the tennis ball; the computer detected the sharp, millisecond pulse of the ball bounce striking the ground, as compared to the slowness and electronic print of player’s foot movements. Even when a foot was present on the sensor a dynamic load circuit was able to detect and distinguish between the signals. Beneath the court surface on each boundary line of the court were both and \"in\" and \"out\" sensors so that if a ball hit the outside of the line and also hit the \"out\" sensor the computer would correctly overrule the \"out\" call allowing play to continue.\n\nThis first electronic device made decisions not only as to whether the ball landed within the boundaries of the playing zones, but also was wired to make foot fault and service net-cord legal serve decisions. The foot fault judge used directional microphones to detect the striking of the ball by the player’s racquet, when serving the ball, that functioned in conjunction with a timing circuit to detect if the players foot had activated the baseline line ‘IN’ sensor immediately prior to, or during, the striking of the ball. The net cord ‘Let’ sensor was a simple piezoelectric device, initially a guitar pickup, to detect if the tennis ball touched the net during the service delivery. The service line sensors, net-cord sensor, legal serve and foot fault devices were turned \"on\" in unison during the process of a player serving the ball at the beginning of each point and then turned \"off\" as the opponent returned the ball.\n\nIn its successful inaugural use, at the Men’s World Championships of Tennis 1974 finals in the Southern Methodist University indoor stadium in Dallas TX, the device was limited to judging only the service line. A later prototype was used to call all tennis court lines plus the net-cord as at the Ladies Virginia Slims championships in Los Angeles during 1975.\n\nThe second system that was publicly demonstrated to electronically officiate line calls was introduced in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK at the Pernod sponsored tennis event in July 1977. pdf file. The system was invented by Lyle David,(pdf file) who patented electrically conductive tennis balls, a micro-computer network systems equipment and installed wires at the boundaries of the court to detect and determine the location of the contact of the ball with the surface.\n\nThe system had some failings with respect to reliability and, like the Grant-Nicks pressure sensor device, did not emerge as a commercial product.\n\nCommercially, the most successful system to emerge in the early experimental period of electronic officiating was the \"Cyclops\". Cyclops was a device used only for service line calls but functioned reliably and was used around the world for many years until superseded by video and television technology. The Cyclops system consisted of a series of infrared laser light beams projected, at a centimeter above the ground, to a receiver device across the court and then to a computer. The series of beams were aligned to accurately determine if the ball was inside the service area. This determination was only valid with respect to the main service line and not the side or center service lines. The Cyclops system was used only on show courts and covered only the main service lines.\n\nIn the 2000s, the sport began to embrace video camera methodology such as Hawk-Eye.\n\nHawk-Eye allows review of player questioned line calls on a select few ‘high’ visibility televised matches. This limited use has been criticized as a social discontinuity in that players of lesser stature that are not asked to play on show courts are being unfairly discriminated against.\n\nThe professional tennis players associations, both the Association of Tennis Professionals and the Women's Tennis Association have approved a method and process of instantaneous re-evaluation of questionable line calls and the system of television video review has become popular.\n\n"}

Originally built in 1927 for the 1929 International Exposition in the city (and Barcelona's bid for the 1936 Summer Olympics, which were awarded to Berlin), it was renovated in 1989 to be the main stadium for the 1992 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe stadium has a capacity of 55,926 (67,007 during the 1992 Olympics), and is located in the Anella Olímpica, in Montjuïc, a large hill to the southwest of the city which overlooks the harbor.\n\nDesigned by architect Pere Domènech i Roura for the 1929 Expo, the stadium was officially opened on 20 May 1929. Montjuïc hosted its first ever event, Spain's first official rugby international game against Italy.\n\nIt was meant to host the People's Olympiad in 1936, a protest event against the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, but the event had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nIn the fifties, the stadium was the centerpiece of the 1955 Mediterranean Games, and in 1957 it hosted the only national football cup Final between FC Barcelona and RCD Espanyol, the two local clubs.\n\nIn the seventies the stadium was disused, and the stands deteriorated. When the Spanish Grand Prix and other races were held at the Montjuïc racing circuit, the stadium was used as a paddock for the teams. Due to safety concerns, the 1975 F1 race was nearly boycotted by drivers.\n\nDue to the award of the 1992 Summer Olympics to Barcelona, the stadium was renovated with the involvement of Italian architect Vittorio Gregotti. The stadium was gutted, preserving only the original facades, and new grandstands were built. In 1989 the venue was re-inaugurated for the World Cup in Athletics, and three years later it hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and the athletics competitions of the Olympic Games.\n\nThe stadium served as the home of football club RCD Espanyol from 1997 until 2009. The Estadi Olímpic made its final La Liga appearance during the 2008-2009 season, as Espanyol moved to the newly constructed RCDE Stadium.\n\nIt also served as the home of the Barcelona Dragons American football team until 2002. Because the size of the playing surface was slightly shorter than the regulation American Football length, the stadium only had 7-yard end zones, three yards shorter than regulation NFL size in 1991 and 1992. They were later lengthened to the standard 10 yards. The stadium also played host to the National Football League's American Bowl in 1993 and in 1994. The San Francisco 49ers played the Pittsburgh Steelers on 1 August 1993. The second game was played on 31 July 1994 between the Los Angeles Raiders and the Denver Broncos.\n\nIn 2001, the stadium was renamed after the former president of the Generalitat de Catalunya Lluís Companys, who was executed at the nearby Montjuïc Castle in 1940 by the Franco regime. In 2010, the stadium hosted the 20th European Athletics Championships.\n\n\n\nThe stadium has hosted concerts by many famous artists, including Coldplay, Muse, AC/DC,Iron Maiden, Bon Jovi, David Bowie, Deftones, Fiction Plane, Guns N' Roses, Michael Jackson, Jean Michel Jarre, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Madonna, Shakira, Metallica, Mudvayne, Pink Floyd, The Police, Prince & The New Power Generation, RBD, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Mavis Staples, Sting, Tina Turner, U2, Beyoncé and Van Halen, among others.MBE Chris Pickford 2018\n\n\n"}

Their flagship product was the Exertris Interactive Exercise Bike, an exercise bike that uses several built in video games to motivate users.\n\nDavies, a Ph.D physicist and a keen fitness enthusiast, invented the Exertris Interactive Exercise Bike to solve the motivation problem with respect to cardiovascular exercise. Observing that traditional exercise bikes simply discarded the energy input of the cyclist as waste heat and sound, he conceived of a system to put the cyclist's energy to use as well as giving direct feedback of their performance.\n\nThe Exertris system combined the addictive qualities of video games with the health benefits of exercise. Unlike previous attempts to 'virtualise' cycling, few of the games on the Exertris bike bore any resemblance to cycling. Instead, the cyclist's energy was virtualised and this virtual energy used to power elements of the games, all of which were designed specifically for the platform. The games also controlled the cycle's resistance in theme with the games. \n\nThe Exertris bike was one of the first Windows XP Embedded systems in the world. Bill Gates show-cased the Exertris bike at the Consumer Electronics Show 2003 during his keynote speech. The Exertris bike was also featured on BBC's \"Tomorrow's World\" in 2002 and televised on the show again the following year when Davies was nominated for the Tomorrow's World Innovation Awards.\n\nThe bike incorporated a gaming platform, an LCD screen, a gamepad and an arm-rest with a patented system that simultaneously raised the screen and arm-rest when the seat was raised ensuring correct posture in a single movement. The system was covered by two other patents: one for a motivational system to convert cycle speed into a virtual energy; a second covered the gearboxed resistance unit that dispensed with the need for a large, separate flywheel.\n\nThe bike also had a 'manual' mode which allowed it to operate as a standard exercise bike, complete with a simulated LED control panel.\n\nThe Exertris Bike originally shipped with four games:\n\nIn a later release of the bike's software two more games were added:\n\nAlthough the Exertris Bike was received enthusiastically by consumers and press alike, economic factors at the time led to financial problems early on. The high manufacturing cost of the bike at low volumes combined with a poor funding environment following the dotcom bust and 9/11 meant the company never achieved profitable status and was forced to close in 2004.\n"}

{"id": "2600884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2600884", "title": "Football helmet", "text": "Football helmet\n\nThe football helmet is a piece of protective equipment used mainly in American football and Canadian football. It consists of a hard plastic shell with thick padding on the inside, a face mask made of one or more plastic-coated metal bars, and a chinstrap. Each position has a different type of face mask to balance protection and visibility, and some players add polycarbonate visors to their helmets, which are used to protect their eyes from glare and impacts. Helmets are a requirement at all levels of organized football, except for non-tackle variations such as flag football. Although they are protective, players can and do still suffer head injuries such as concussions.\n\nOne of the first instances of football headgear dates to 1896 when Lafayette College halfback George \"Rose\" Barclay began to use straps and earpieces to protect his ears. It is not certain who invented the football helmet. Many sources give credit for the creation of the helmet to James Naismith, while other sources credit U.S. Naval Academy Midshipman Joseph M. Reeves (later to become the \"Father of Carrier Aviation\"), who had a protective device for his head made out of mole skin to allow him to play in the 1893 Army-Navy game. Reeves had been advised by a Navy doctor that another kick to his head would result in \"instant insanity\" or even death, so he commissioned an Annapolis shoemaker to make him a helmet out of leather. Later, helmets were made of padded leather and resembled aviators' helmets or modern day scrum caps. At least in professional football, they were optional. Some National Football League players, notably Hall-of-Famer Bill Hewitt, played all or most of their careers without a helmet.\n\nOne innovation from the early 1900s period was hardened leather. 1917 marked the first time helmets were raised above the head in an attempt to direct blows away from the top of the head. Ear flaps also had their downfall during this period as they had little ventilation and made it difficult for players to hear. The 1920s marked the first time that helmets were widely used in the sport of football. These helmets were made of leather and had some padding on the inside, but the padding was insufficient and provided little protection. In addition, they lacked face masks. As a result, injuries were very common. Early helmets also absorbed a lot of heat, making them very uncomfortable to wear.\n\nIn 1939, the Riddell Company of Chicago, Illinois started manufacturing plastic helmets because it felt that plastic helmets would be safer than those made of leather. Plastic was found to be more effective because it held its shape when full collision contact occurred on a play. These helmets were also much more comfortable and had more padding to cushion the head in an impact. Included with the plastic helmet came plastic face mask, which allowed the helmet to protect the entire head. By the mid-1940s, helmets were required in the NFL. They were still made of leather, but with improved manufacturing techniques had assumed their more familiar spherical shape. The NFL initially allowed either plastic or leather helmets, but in 1948 the league outlawed the plastic helmet, considering the hard-plastic material to be an injury risk. The NFL repealed this rule in 1949, and by 1950, the plastic helmet had become universal in that league.\n\nBy the 1950s, the introduction of polymers ended the leather helmet era. The last leather helmet manufacturer, MacGregor, ceased production of leather helmets in the mid-1960s. The NFL also recommended face masks for players in 1955, reducing the number of broken noses and teeth, but also necessitating new rules prohibiting opposing players from grabbing the face mask. By varying accounts, either Pat Studstill or Garo Yepremian was the last to forgo the facemask; among non-kickers, Tommy McDonald was the last to do so.\n\nAccording to Andrew Tucker, football helmets adequately protected players from catastrophic brain injuries, but helmet manufacturers were motivated to design helmets that decrease the risk of concussions. Vin Ferrara, a former Harvard quarterback, accidentally discovered a new way to cushion football helmets. One night, Ferrara was looking for an aspirin when he saw a squirt bottle in his medicine cabinet. As he pumped it and then punched it, he realized that the bottle withstood the blows of different forces. Ferrara immediately came up with the idea to encase football helmets with a number of inflatable pockets in order to cushion the blows a football player receives and reduce concussions.\n\nMore recently, in 2003 Schutt sports introduced their football helmets which contained TPU, or thermoplastic urethane. They would argue that this helps cushion the head more than any other helmet in the market. Schutt also believes that TPU makes the helmet less prone to mold and easier overall to clean and keep sanitary.\n\nA more recent addition to the football helmet is the visor or eye shield, which is affixed to the face mask to protect players from glare or eye injuries, such as pokes. It is believed that the first player to use a protective visor was Mark Mullaney of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings in 1984, in order to protect a healing eye injury. Top manufacturers of visors are Nike, Oakley, and Under Armour, with Leader being the first to come out with a visor/shield for former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon (who needed the visor because of a childhood eye injury). While Mullaney and McMahon's visors were tinted, most of the earlier visors were clear or smoked, but they are now offered in a variety of styles ranging from blue, gold, black, rainbow, silver, or amber. High-school and pee-wee leagues prohibit all but clear visors. This rule was enacted so that training staff and coaches can easily view a player's face and eyes in the case of a serious injury, to discern if the player is conscious. The NCAA banned the use of tinted visors for the same reason, and the NFL has followed suit as well. However, players with eye problems may still obtain special permission to wear tinted visors, some notable examples being LaDainian Tomlinson and Chris Canty.\nHelmet shock data loggers and shock detectors monitor impacts a player receives, such as the force and direction of the impact. If the force recorded by the sensors is over 100 Gs, it signals a possible concussion.{} Some players will experience up to 2,000 of these potential concussion blows each season.This data is then analyzed by doctors. New rules have been implemented which instruct that any player who has a particularly high reading of force needs to be taken off the field and examined before they can play another down.\n\nTwo Ohio inventors devised a headset for Cleveland Browns coach Paul Brown so he could radio plays to his quarterback. It was banned shortly after its first use in 1956. The NFL approved use of headsets for all NFL teams in 1994.\n\nNFL rules state that all helmets equipped with headsets must have a visible green dot on the back. A few times in 2006, the holder on the field goal attempt was told to pull up and throw or run at the last second because of a change the coaches saw on the field. According to the NFL, this gave teams an \"unfair advantage.\" The new rules let each team know who is wearing a headset and hearing the plays being called.\n\nThe one-bar face mask was once common but its use has been supplanted in professional and amateur sport. For example, it has been illegal in the National Football League since 2004, but a grandfather clause allowed players who wore the mask prior to 2004 to continue to do so for the remainder of their careers. No current professional player currently wears such a face mask; the last player to do so was Scott Player, who last played professionally in 2009.\n\nTypically, by the mid-1980s only placekickers and punters in professional football in Canada and the United States wore the one-bar face mask, a notable exception being quarterback Joe Theismann.\n\nThe one-bar had two different variations. The standard one-bar was made from nylon or other hard plastic and was bolted to both side of the helmet just in front of the earholes. There was a \"snub\" version that did not extend as far out in front of the helmet as the standard.\n\nFace masks for football helmets today are multibar. The multibar facemasks are typically constructed out of metal, such as titanium, stainless steel, or most commonly carbon steel. Each facemask is coated with Polyarmor G17, a powder coating that is resistant to impact and corrosion. The Polyarmor is a thermoplastic coating used on a number of surfaces. While some organizations purchase new face masks every season, others have their equipment reconditioned.\n\nIn 2002, American football equipment manufacturer Riddell released a new design of helmet called the Revolution. The newer design was released in response to a study on concussions. In addition, Riddell has recently come out with a new design of helmets, the Riddell Speed Flex. This helmet came out in 2014. This new helmet uses elements of Riddell's older helmets, the 360 and the Revolution, such as Side Impact Protection and All Points Quick Release face mask attachment system.\nIn 2007, Schutt Sports announced the arrival of a next generation helmet, the Schutt ION 4D. This next generation design was in response to the demand for a safer football helmet. The design includes an integrated face guard. This new face guard design features shock absorbing \"Energy Wedges\" that reduce the force of impacts to the face guard. College teams wearing the helmet include Air Force, Penn State and Virginia. Schutt has also distinguished between their varsity helmets and youth helmets. The varsity helmets from Schutt are made with polycarbonate, which is a very strong polymer designed to take bigger hits. The Schutt youth helmets however; are made from ABS, which is a lighter material, meant for kids who do not take as powerful of hits.\n\nRecently, a brand new type of helmet has come into play. Vicis is a new company that is producing helmets that have a softer outer layer. The softer layer absorbs more energy from impacts. In addition, the inside of the helmet also has a foam like substance which absorbs energy and improves comfort.\n\nRules in place for NFL, NCAA, and high school football require that all helmets be certified by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment.\nReliance on NOCSAE certification has been criticized on numerous grounds, including that organization's control by equipment manufacturers causes a conflict of interest, testing data that focuses on skull fractures instead of concussions, and failure to take into account new research.\n\nThe most common NOCSAE test is the drop test. This test uses a 13-pound dummy head full of sensors and a gelatin material. The head and helmet is dropped from a height of 60 at one of the six NOCSAE specified locations on the helmet. These locations include the front, rear, left side, right side, right boss, and left boss. The sensors in the dummy head measure the amount of force that the head experiences. The NOCSAE has certain regulations such as the peak severity index can never more than1200 SI. If a helmet fails to meet these requirements, they do not pass the NOCSAE drop test.\n\nThere has been significant study/research regarding head injuries in football, as well as football helmet design in recent years. Kevin Guskiewicz, a professor at The University of North Carolina and a MacArthur Fellow, has for many years been researching concussions in football of all age groups. He has been equipping UNC football helmets with accelerometers to measure impacts and concussions. Also, the NFL has awarded over $1.6 million in sports medical research, almost $1 million of which has been toward concussion prevention. All this concussion prevention research has led football helmet manufacturers to develop safer products. A joint effort between Virginia Tech and Wake Forest has been testing current football helmets and giving them yearly ratings since 2011. On a scale out of 5 stars, only one helmet was awarded a 5 in 2011. In 2012, two additional helmet designs were awarded 5 stars.\n\nControversies revolving around football helmets always regard their ability to decrease head/brain injury rates, including concussions. However, recent research has begun to assess the tests specifically employed to create the safest football equipment. In 2015, David Camarillo at Stanford conducted a study that suggested football helmet tests did not account for the delay between injury-causing brain movement and stress impact.\n\nNeuroscientists at Ohio State University launched baseballs from air cannons at football helmets in order to simulate a kick or blow to the head such as a tackle. It was found that the helmets could withstand 2,500 Newtons or about 562 pounds of force.\n\nVijay Gupta, a professor at UCLA, has done research and produced a special polymer that if added as a layer on the inside of football helmets can produce up to a 25% decrease in the g-forces a player would experience. This reduction of forces would produce a similar amount of reduction of the probability of a player suffering a concussion from the same hits.\n\nIn 1948, the Los Angeles Rams were the first NFL team to put logos on their helmets; the basic \"ram's horn\" logo on the helmet has remained mostly the same, except for color, ever since. the Cleveland Browns are the last remaining NFL teams not using any form of primary logo on its helmets. The Pittsburgh Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side), while the Cincinnati Bengals, after using a wordmark for a helmet logo into the 1980s, use a striping pattern instead of a logo.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}
{"id": "7230818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7230818", "title": "Gaelic games county colours", "text": "Gaelic games county colours\n\nThe county colours of an Irish county are the colours of the kit worn by that county's representative team in the inter-county competitions of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), the most important of which are the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Fans attending matches often wear replica jerseys, and wave flags and banners in the county colours. In the build-up to a major match, flags and bunting are flown or hung from cars, buildings, telegraph poles, and other fixtures across the county, especially in those regions where GAA support is strong.\n\nWhere a county's jersey is multi-coloured, these are the county colours. Where the jersey is a single colour, the colour of the shorts is also included. Shorts were formerly always white, but some counties adopted coloured shorts from the 1960s, such as Dublin's now familiar navy blue. \n\nIn the early years of the All-Ireland championships, each county was formally represented by the club which won its county championship; players from other clubs within the county were soon added to reinforce the squad, and gradually from 1900 county committees took over the selection of the team. At that date most inter-county teams still wore the kit of the champion club, but by 1910 some counties had adopted a standard strip. The 1913 GAA Congress passed a motion proposed by P. D. Mehigan and seconded by Harry Boland, \"That a distinctive county colour be compulsory for inter-county, inter-provincial and All-Ireland contests, such colours to be approved of by the Provincial Councils concerned and registered with Central Council.\"\n\nWhile each county council has a coat of arms, there are no official county flags. Flags with the GAA county colours serve as de facto county flags. However, there are no standardised formats for these, except Kildare whose flag, like their kit, is all-white. Typically, flags are formed as vertical bicolours or tricolours. Usually, the major colour is nearer the hoist. Moreover, horizontal stripes are used by some individuals. (This is common in County Offaly, where vertical county colours might be mistaken for the flag of Ireland; however other Offaly fans deliberately exploit this double significance.)\n\nFlags with checkerboard, repeating stripes, and other patterns are also found. In recent years, flags have been commercially produced which feature the county's GAA logo on the flag. These logos are sometimes based on the official county coat-of-arms, but some have been replaced with unrelated designs. Fans may also wave other flags of the appropriate colours. For example, among the red-and-white flags used by individual Cork GAA supporters have been the flag of Canada and the ensign of the Imperial Japanese Navy. As Cork is nicknamed the \"Rebel County\", its fans have also flown the Rebel Flag of the American Civil War. With the Blue and Gold flags used by individual Tipperary GAA supporters, there has been the Flag of Sweden and the Flag of Ukraine. Mayo fans have used the flags of Italy, Portugal and Bangladesh. Kerry supporters have been seen to wave Brazilian flags due to the similar colours and fact that Brazil have always dominated soccer while Kerry are considered the \"Brazil of Gaelic Football\" due to their enormous success at the sport.\n\nThe British Provincial Board is responsible for seven areas of Britain that are treated as \"counties\" by the GAA. Their representative teams naturally have standard kit colours like the Irish counties.\nThe New York County Board is responsible for Gaelic games in the New York metropolitan area, recognised as a \"county\" by the GAA.\n\n"}

{"id": "1599509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1599509", "title": "Ice Princess", "text": "Ice Princess\n\nIce Princess is a 2005 American figure-skating film directed by Tim Fywell, written by Hadley Davis from a story by Meg Cabot and Davis, and starring Michelle Trachtenberg, Joan Cusack, Kim Cattrall and Hayden Panettiere. The film focuses on Casey Carlyle, a normal teenager who gives up a promising future academic life in order to pursue her new-found dream of being a professional figure skater. The film was released on March 18, 2005. \"Ice Princess\" had an unsuccessful performance at the box office, grossing $24 million in the United States during its theatrical run against a production budget of $25 million.\n\nCasey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) a very smart and talented science student, plans to pursue a scholarship to Harvard University. For the scholarship, Casey must present a personal summer project about physics. While watching a figure skating competition with her mathematically inclined friend Ann, Casey realizes that her favorite childhood hobby, ice skating, would make a perfect project. She decides to try to improve her own skating by applying physics and what she has discovered from watching other skaters.\n\nShe becomes proficient and skips two levels to become a junior skater. She helps junior skaters Gennifer \"Gen\" Harwood (Hayden Panettiere) Tiffany Lai (Jocelyn Lai) and Nikki Fletcher (Kirsten Olson) improve their skating. Torn between her Harvard dream and her growing love of skating, Casey has difficulty juggling schoolwork, skating, and a part-time job. Joan Carlyle (Joan Cusack) Casey's mother, attempts to prevent Casey from skating due to her declining academic performance. Meanwhile, tension arises between Casey's mother and Casey's coach Tina Harwood (Kim Cattrall), a disgraced former skater.\n\nTina, who manages the rink where Casey trains, has Gen on a strict training program. During a competition where both Casey and Gen compete, Tina sees that Casey may outrank Gen, and attempts to sabotage Casey's performance by switching her skates. Upset at this, and frustrated by all the restrictions of training, Gen quits. Casey declines the Harvard scholarship competition to devote herself to skating to her mother's dismay. Casey asks Tina to be her personal coach and help her train for sectionals. Her mother, upset at this change of direction in her life, refuses to watch her skate.\n\nAt the sectionals, Casey's mind is not fully focused on the competition and she falls while attempting a triple salchow jump. To her surprise, she discovers that her mother is in the audience. Inspired, Casey gives a highly rated artistic performance. The sectionals ends with Nikki going to the nationals and Casey becoming the runner-up. Gen's brother, Teddy (Trevor Blumas), gives Casey flowers to congratulate her, and they kiss. Later, Joan and Tina bicker about how many college courses Casey should take, Teddy and Casey's budding romance, Casey's sponsors, and Casey's future in figure skating.\n\n\nBlumas said that he was put on hold for two months during the audition process, and that there had been \"a lot of switch-overs with the directors\". Blumas ended up playing Teddy as a sort of father figure. He began training to drive a Zamboni soon after arriving in Toronto; according to him, he later ended up smoothing the ice on some mornings at the rink where they were shooting. Panettiere did much of her own skating, including a fast spin seen at the end of the regionals short program. Trachtenberg trained for eight months, including the time they were filming (during which time she says she worked twenty-hour days). She had to be on the ice longer than most of the other actors as she was one of the few adults on the film. She had stunt doubles to handle the falls and some of the complex moves, although Trachtenberg did learn a specific move that could not be done by a stunt double as the differences in their build would be apparent. She sustained some injuries while working on the film. According to Trachtenberg, a mistake was made in one of the physics formulas her character recites, which was later fixed; a shot of the back of her head was used and the correct term was looped in. Trachtenberg described the film as \"not a Disney kitschy movie\" and was somewhat apprehensive of the idea of a sequel for fear of belittling the original. Cusack noted that the relationship between Casey and her mother had already been well-developed in the script, but said that it generated a good deal of discussion during the production, and Cusack ultimately described her role as \"meaningful\" in terms of the acting and also how it related to her personally.\n\nThe film was shot from May 3 to July 23, 2004 at several locations in Toronto, including George Bell Arena, Western Technical-Commercial School, Christie Mansion and De La Salle College.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $6,807,471 million in 2,501 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #4 at the box office, behind \"The Ring Two\", \"Robots\" and \"The Pacifier\". By the end of its run, \"Ice Princess\" grossed $24,402,491 domestically and $3,243,000 internationally, totaling $27,645,491 worldwide.\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gives \"Ice Princess\" three out of four stars and commended the film for its entertaining nature and ability to overcome cliche and \"formula\". Reactions from other critics have been mixed, as 52% of the T-meter critics on Rotten Tomatoes reviewed the film positively. Todd Gilchrist of IGN questioned the speed at which Casey becomes adept at skating and pointed out some other improbabilities and clichés, but strongly praised Cusack’s and Cattrall’s performances as emotionally powerful and fully human. United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Office for Film and Broadcasting rated the film A-I (suitable for general patronage) and provided the film a modest praise as a good family film. Oppenheim Toy Portfolio awarded the film their platinum award. It is rated G by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nZahra Lari, a Muslim figure skater from the United Arab Emirates, cited \"Ice Princess\" as an inspiration for her career.\n\nThe Ice Princess Original Soundtrack was released on March 15, 2005 in the United States by label Walt Disney Records, features tracks by Natasha Bedingfield, Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere, Michelle Branch, Aly & AJ, Jesse McCartney, and Raven-Symoné, and various other artists. It peaked at number 53 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and at number 2 on Top Soundtracks.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25776673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25776673", "title": "Laws of rugby league", "text": "Laws of rugby league\n\nIn rugby league football, the Laws of the Game are the rules governing how the sport is played. The Laws are the responsibility of the Rugby League International Federation, and cover the play, officiating, equipment and procedures of the game. \n\nThe Laws have undergone significant changes since pioneers of the sport broke away from the Rugby football establishment in 1895. The sport has been described as a \"constantly evolving animal, particularly with professional coaches, [with which] the rules have to keep pace\".\n\nThe current \"Laws of the Game\" and \"Notes on the Laws\" are set out in 17 sections:\n\nThe current 17 sections, which include notes, are detailed in fewer than 50 pages and around 17,000 words. The Laws therefore have some flexibility to enable decisions to be made without the need to amend them. For example, Section 15, Law 1 (i) considers behaviour \"in any way contrary to the true spirit of the game\" to be misconduct. That law has been used to prevent chicken-wing tackling techniques, for example.\n\nThe rules of football as played at Rugby School in the 19th century were decided regularly and informally by the pupils. For many years the rules were unwritten. In 1845 three pupils at the school, William Delafield Arnold, Walter Waddington Shirley and Frederick Leigh Hutchins were tasked with writing a codified set of rules by the then Head Schoolboy and football captain Isaac Gregory Smith. The three pupils submitted 37 rules which were approved on 28 August 1845. Another pupil, Charles Harcourt Chambers, illustrated the Rules.\n\nThe Rules played at the school continued to develop over time and as pupils left they took with them the game as they had played it. In 1871, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was founded with the purpose of standardising the rules for the clubs playing the Rugby style of football in England. The RFU invited three former pupils, all lawyers, to write the standardised rules, and they titled their work as \"laws\". In June of that year the first Laws of the Game were approved.\n\nUnions were formed to govern the game in other countries but the English RFU continued to control the Laws until 1885. In 1884, there had been a dispute over the rules between the English and Scottish unions after a match between the two countries; this led to the formation of the International Rugby Football Board in 1886 with the intention of settling such disputes. The RFU refused to join and in 1887 the members of the new organisation, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, stated that no matches would be played against England until the RFU joined and accepted its rules. In 1890 the RFU joined and in 1892 a significant revision of the laws took place.\n\nFrom 1895, the year of the schism in the game, the laws of rugby league were initially referred to as \"Northern Union\" rules, after the new governing body, and were a slight variation on the rules of rugby football as played at that time. What began as modifications to make the competition more entertaining to spectators continued until a distinct sport had emerged.\n\nInitially the rules were decided by the Northern Rugby Football Union, today's Rugby Football League, the governing body for rugby league in the United Kingdom. As the sport spread to around the world, other rugby leagues were established, notably in Australia, France and New Zealand, a more international approach was adopted. In 1948, the International Rugby League Board (IRLB) was formed. Initially the RFL retained this responsibility for the Laws while it was seen how the new Board would develop. The IRLB was invested with responsibility for the Laws later.\n\nDuring the Super League war, a dispute over media rights and the control of the game originating in Australia, the laws of rugby league were altered by the rival factions, the IRLB and its only remaining member, the Australian Rugby League, and the Super League International Board and its members.\n\nSince 1998 when the different sides reunited, the Laws have been the responsibility of the Rugby League International Federation.\n\nThe Northern Rugby Football Union inherited the existing laws of rugby football, as played until that time by its member clubs. The NRFU immediately made changes. In addition to the time before 1948 when an international governing body was established, members of the International Federation and its predecessors have had the authority to make significant changes to the Laws applied within their jurisdiction.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of changes made to the laws of rugby league since the 1895 schism. Changes to the laws used for senior competitions within the jurisdictions of RLIF members with test nation status are included here.\n\n\nNRFU \n\n\nNRFU \n\n\nNRFU \n\n\nNRFU \n\n\nNRFU \n\n\nNRFU \n\n\nNRFU \n\n\nNRFU \n\n\nNRFU \n\n\nNRFU \n\n\n\n\n NSWRFL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NSWRFL \n\n\n\n\n NSWRFL \n\n\n RFL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NSWRFL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NSWRFL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n NSWRFL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NSWRL \n\n\n\n\nIRLB \n\n\n\n\n\nSLIB \n\n RFL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NRL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RFL \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "185501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185501", "title": "Ozark Ike", "text": "Ozark Ike\n\nOzark Ike was a newspaper comic strip about dumb but likable Ozark Ike McBatt, a youth from a rural area in the mountains. The strip was created by Rufus A. (\"Ray\") Gotto while he was serving in the Navy during World War II in Washington, D.C. as an illustrator for Navy instruction manuals.\n\nStrong-but-simple Ike McBatt is from a hillbilly family living in the small backwoods community of Wildweed Run (pop. 49). Ozark Ike is an all-around athlete, playing baseball, football and basketball. Between seasons, he enters the boxing ring. The characters and the baseball park settings are apparently inspired by Ring Lardner's well-known baseball short story \"Alibi Ike\" (1915), filmed in 1935 as the comedy \"Alibi Ike\", starring Joe E. Brown in the title role and Olivia de Havilland in her film debut.\n\nOzark Ike's girlfriend is Dinah Fatfield, whose family has been involved in a feud with the McBatt clan for several generations. As is evident in the names, this background situation was inspired by the Hatfield-McCoy feud.\n\nGotto is famous for using extreme perspectives to achieve great drama an action in sports. As such \"Ozark Ike\" attracted publisher Stephen Slesinger's attention. Slesinger also owned \"Red Ryder\", \"King of the Royal Mounted\", US and Canadian rights to \"Winnie-the-Pooh\", and had exclusive licensing arrangements for other notable fictional characters including Tarzan and all of the NEA newspaper comics. Slesinger produced the cartoon for distribution through King Features Syndicate, and it debuted November 12, 1945. \n\nOne of the assistants on the strip was Fred Rhoads. Gotto left in 1954, but the strip continued until 1959 under Bill Lignante and George Olesen. Lignante was also a leading courtroom artist for network television, and is most famous as the artist who created hundreds of drawings of famous patrons that decorate the Palm Restaurants. \n\nGotto eventually went on to design the New York Mets logo.\n\n\"Ozark Ike\" was the nickname of major league baseball players Gus Zernial .\n\n"}

{"id": "8054629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8054629", "title": "Vivint Smart Home Arena", "text": "Vivint Smart Home Arena\n\nVivint Smart Home Arena is an indoor arena located in Salt Lake City, Utah. The building is owned by the Miller Family Legacy Trust. The arena is the home of the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and has been the home venue for other professional athletic teams such as the Utah Blaze of the Arena Football League and the Utah Starzz of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). It seats 18,306 for basketball, has 56 luxury suites, and 668 club seats.\n\nOpened in 1991, the arena was known as the Delta Center, under a naming rights deal with Delta Air Lines, which has a hub at Salt Lake City International Airport. Salt Lake City-based EnergySolutions purchased the naming rights in November 2006, after Delta decided not to renew their 15-year contract due to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the year prior. From 2006 to 2015 it was known as EnergySolutions Arena. On October 26, 2015, the arena was renamed as part of a 10-year naming rights contract with the Provo, Utah-based home security system provider Vivint.\n\nThe arena was also home to the figure skating and short track speed skating competitions of the 2002 Winter Olympics, where it was referred to as the Salt Lake Ice Center.\n\nThe arena was originally imagined as 20,000-seat home for the Utah Jazz and Salt Lake Golden Eagles to replace the since-demolished arena of the Salt Palace, which had 12,616 seats. Under the leadership and private financing of Utah businessman Larry H. Miller, ground was broken on May 22, 1990, and it was completed on October 4, 1991 in time for late-October basketball games, at a cost of $93 million ($ in dollars.) \n\nThe first game played in the arena was a Golden Eagles match against the Peoria Rivermen on October 16, 1991, which the home team lost 4–2. The Eagles had also played the inaugural game in the Salt Palace arena when it opened on October 10, 1969. The Eagles, which were purchased by Miller in 1990, lost nearly a million dollars annually and would not long play in the Delta Center.\n\nThe first basketball game played in the arena was a Jazz pre-season loss against Patrick Ewing and the New York Knicks, 101–95. \nThe 1993–95 Western Athletic Conference men's basketball tournaments were held at the facility, as was the 1993 NBA All-Star Game. The Delta Center also hosted games of the 1997 and 1998 NBA Finals between the Jazz and Chicago Bulls.\n\nIn addition to the Utah Jazz and Blaze, the arena has also been the home of the WNBA's Utah Starzz from 1997 to 2002, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles from 1991 to 1994, and the Utah Grizzlies from 1995 to 1997, both of the International Hockey League. Notably, on June 8, 1996, the Delta Center hosted what was then the largest crowd in the history of American minor league hockey: 17,381 fans attended Game 4 of the 1996 Turner Cup Finals. The Grizzlies won 3–2 in overtime, completing a four-game sweep of the Orlando Solar Bears and earning the IHL championship in their first season in Utah.\n\nDan Roberts serves as the official Vivint Smart Home Arena public address voice for the Jazz. He has been the Jazz's home game announcer since before the arena was built.\nIn 2002, the arena upgraded its super system with ribbon display technology and auxiliary scoreboards from Brookings, South Dakota-based Daktronics.\n\nDuring the summer of 2010, the Arena was remodeled, which included the installation of Bear's Backyard, a playground for kids, a new dining area for adults and over 500 television screens. On June 17, 2013 the Utah Jazz announced that the arena would receive a new scoreboard and ribbon display technology, including display screens in each corner of the arena. The new scoreboard and display systems were installed during the 2013 NBA off-season.\n\nOn September 21, 2016, the Utah Jazz announced plans to renovate and upgrade Vivint Smart Home Arena. The majority of the construction related to the building's renovation, which is estimated to cost US$125 million, will begin at the conclusion of the 2016–17 Utah Jazz basketball season, with anticipated completion of the renovation by fall 2017.\n\nDuring the Salt Lake City Olympics, due to IOC policies about having corporate sponsorship for venues, the arena was referred to as the Salt Lake Ice Center during events.\n\nAfter Delta Air Lines declined to renew their 15-year naming rights contract, which expired on September 30, 2006, the stadium's owner, Larry H. Miller, opted to sell naming rights to EnergySolutions, a low-level nuclear waste disposal company headquartered in Salt Lake City. The new name was unveiled November 20, prior to the Jazz home game against the Toronto Raptors. Two stickers were placed on the court, covering up the arena's old name with the new one. The temporary logos were replaced with official logos on the court sometime in December. EnergySolutions naming rights were set to expire in 2016.\n\nInitial fan reactions to the new name were predominantly negative. Early nicknames for the arena included \"the Dump\", a jab at EnergySolutions' radioactive and hazardous waste disposal operations. Other suggestions included the Glow Dome, Radium Stadium, Isotope, Chernobowl, Jazzmat, Big Bang, Tox Box, Power House, Hot Spot, Plutonium Palace, Fallout Shelter, Melta Center, and Energy Pollutions Arena.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, the naming rights were acquired by the locally based home security and automation provider Vivint in a 10-year contract.\n\nOutside the arena are statues of two players widely regarded as the greatest in the history of the Jazz, as well as among the greatest players in NBA history. The John Stockton statue was unveiled on March 30, 2005. The Karl Malone statue was unveiled on March 23, 2006. The Jazz played games on each of those nights but lost both games.\n\nOn April 15, 2010, over a year after the death of Jazz owner Larry H. Miller, the Jazz basketball court was named in his honor. With the announcement of the arena's new name on October 26, 2015, the new official name of the court is Larry H. Miller Court at Vivint Smart Home Arena.\n\nThe facility played host to the 1999 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. The arena was also home to the figure skating and short track speed skating competitions of the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn the final of the Men's 1000 metres Short track speed skating event at the 2002 Winter Olympics, veteran Australian Steven Bradbury became the most unlikely winner in Winter Olympic history when he won the race after Apolo Anton Ohno (USA), Mathieu Turcotte (Canada), Ahn Hyun-Soo (South Korea), and Li Jiajun (China) all fell on the final turn and left Bradbury, who was running last and about behind the pack, to come through and claim Australia's first ever Winter Olympics Gold Medal.\n\nVivint Smart Home Arena was the site of the West regional semifinals (\"Sweet Sixteen\") and championship (\"Elite Eight\") in the 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. The venue also hosted first and second-round games in the 2013 and 2017 editions of the tournament, and it will do so again in 2019.\n\nIn addition to sports, the arena was intended to host large music concerts. On October 24, 1991, Oingo Boingo became the first headlining act to rock the Delta Center.\n\nThe movie \"\" was partially filmed in the arena.\n\nThe arena's roof was damaged by severe winds associated with the Salt Lake City Tornado of August 11, 1999, costing $3,757,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to repair.\n\nVivint Smart Home Arena is well known for being one of the hardest places to play for visiting teams in the NBA. According to an NBA Players Poll taken by \"Sports Illustrated\" on February 11, 2008, the Vivint Arena is considered \"the most intimidating arena in the NBA\" with 20% of the vote made up of 240 current NBA players. Many commentators referred to the arena as the \"Decibel Center\", a play on the name \"Delta Center\". During Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals, a decibel meter installed at floor level had readings of over 110 decibels, close to the noise generated by a jet takeoff. Also, during the 1997 NBA Finals, NBC's Hannah Storm called the then-named Delta Center \"one of the loudest places in sports\".\n"}
