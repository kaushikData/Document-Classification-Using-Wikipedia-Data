Following the brawl, Manly went on to win the match 18–4, on its way to finishing second on the premiership ladder.\n\nSeveral players faced charges at the NRL Judiciary with suspensions and fines being handed out.\n\nThe Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and the Melbourne Storm have, in recent years, engaged in a modern-day rivalry which is amongst one of the most recognised in the National Rugby League today. In seven of eight seasons between 2006 and 2013 (except 2010), at least one of these two teams featured in the Grand Final, and, in the five of six seasons between 2007 and 2012, one of these teams won the premiership, though the Storm's 2007 and 2009 titles (the former of which was won by defeating Manly in the Grand Final) were later stripped from the club as a result of salary cap breaches exposed by the NRL in 2010.\n\nThe height of this rivalry came with the two clubs' meetings in the 2007 and 2008 NRL Grand Finals. Melbourne defeated Manly 34–8 to win the 2007 title, whilst Manly reversed the result and won by a record 40–0 scoreline in 2008. They have also featured in two finals matches, with Melbourne winning both by the scoreline of 40–12 in the 2009 qualifying final and the 2012 preliminary final.\n\nThis was to be the first match attended by David Gallop of either side since suspending Brett Stewart from the first four weeks of the 2009 season for a sexual assault charge for which he would later be exonerated, and since stripping the Storm of two premiership titles and three minor premiership titles for salary cap breaches; extra security was hired for his presence at the game.\n\nKieran Foran scored the first try of the match for the Sea Eagles early in the first half, after Billy Slater misjudged a ball which had bounced in the Sea Eagles' in-goal area.\n\nIn the 22nd minute of the match, Manly winger David Williams suffered a neck injury, which resulted in play being suspended whilst he was carried off the stretcher. In stark contrast to what would come later in the game, Billy Slater who had tackled Williams (Williams had hit Slater's chest with the top of his head which caused the injury), realising there was a neck injury, cradled Williams and wouldn't let him move or his Manly team mates move him until the medical staff arrived.\n\nShortly after the Williams injury, Melbourne interchange forward Ryan Hinchcliffe conceded a penalty when he struck Manly's Darcy Lussick close to the Sea Eagles' line. This resulted in a brawl between the two players, following which Adam Blair and Glenn Stewart were sin-binned for joining in.\n\nOn their way to the dressing rooms, a major brawl erupted between Blair and Stewart, which involved players and officials from both sides; the two subsequently had their sin-bin punishments upgraded to a send off, meaning they would take no further part in the match.\n\nApart from the main culprits, many other players, including Brett Stewart, also joined in the brawl, with Stewart claiming that he was acting in self-defence of his older brother. Officials and trainers from both clubs also joined in the brawl.\n\nManly captain Jamie Lyon converted a penalty goal from the Hinchcliffe penalty from right in front, as the Sea Eagles' lead stretched to 8–0. The Sea Eagles would eventually win 18–4 with a late Billy Slater try preventing the Storm from being held scoreless for the first time since the 2008 NRL Grand Final.\n\nNo fewer than ten players and two officials from both clubs were later charged by the NRL Judiciary for their roles in the brawl, with both Glenn Stewart and Adam Blair referred straight to the judiciary. Additionally, each club was fined $50,000 from the NRL. For their parts, Glenn Stewart and Adam Blair were both banned for three and five matches respectively.\n\nThe charges and outcomes were as follows:\n\nThen-NRL CEO David Gallop condemned the actions of both teams, saying:\n\nDespite the spiteful nature of the match, Melbourne's Billy Slater won universal praise for his actions after the neck injury to Manly winger David Williams.\n\n\n"}

It is the home field of the Alabama Crimson Tide football team of the Southeastern Conference (SEC).\n\nOpened in 1929, it was originally named Denny Stadium in honor of George H. Denny, the school's president from 1912 to 1932. In 1975, the state legislature added longtime head coach and alumnus Paul \"Bear\" Bryant to the stadium's name. Bryant led the Tide for seven more seasons, through 1982, and is one of the few in Division I to have coached in a venue bearing his name.\n\nWith a seating capacity of 101,821, it is the fourth-largest stadium in the Southeastern Conference, the seventh largest stadium in the United States and the eighth largest stadium in the world.\n\nThe replacement for Denny Field, Denny Stadium opened in 1929, with 6,000 in attendance for a 55–0 victory over Mississippi College on September 28. It was officially dedicated the following week at Homecoming ceremonies against Ole Miss, a 22–7 Crimson Tide victory. Originally, the stadium had a capacity of 12,000—the lower half of the current stadium's east grandstand. However, President Denny initially envisioned a full bowl stadium capable of seating 66,000.\n\nBefore the 1937 season, permanent seats were built along the east sideline, increasing the capacity to 24,000. Further expansions in 1946 (bleachers in both end zones), 1961 (new seats in west grandstand), and 1966 (both end zones fully enclosed, new seats in east grandstand) raised capacity to 31,000, 43,000, and 60,210, respectively. An upper deck was added to the west side in 1988 and raised the seating by nearly 10,000 to 70,123. During the construction, the Crimson Tide played its entire 1987 home schedule at Legion Field in Birmingham, northeast of Bryant-Denny.\n\nIn September 1995, the University of Alabama System Board of Trustees approved the construction of the east upper deck. Designed by the architectural firm of Heery-Chambless-Adams, the construction was financed by the university and $4.65 million from the city of Tuscaloosa, the city of Northport, and Tuscaloosa County. The localities contributed to construction costs in return for the university pledging to move all Crimson Tide home games to Bryant–Denny and not play any at Legion Field.\n\nThe new upper deck provided 10,000 additional bleacher seats and 81 skyboxes on two levels—63 16-seat and 18 24-seat capacity boxes. In 1999, four additional skyboxes were built to bring the total number of skyboxes to 85. A JumboTron scoreboard with video display capabilities was erected in the south end zone and was at the time the largest in collegiate sports. Additionally, a new east side entrance tower, a brick facade and reception areas for the Scholarship and A-Club level patrons was also added during the 1998 expansion.\n\nThe stadium's eastern upper deck was opened in 1998 and raised its official seating capacity to 83,818 at a final cost of $35 million for the addition. The newly expanded venue debuted on September 5, and Alabama defeated BYU 38–31 as running back Shaun Alexander set a Tide single-game record with five touchdowns.\n\nFollowing the 2004 season, the university spent approximately $47 million on an expansion to the north end zone, which was completed days before the 2006 opener against Hawaii. It added a new upper deck to the North end zone area, complete with three different levels of skyboxes, which collectively are known as \"The Zone\", which brought the number of skyboxes in the stadium to 123. Two large display screens by Daktronics were placed in each corner of the north end zone, and LCD ribbon screens, tall by wide, were placed along the front edge of the east and west upper decks.\n\nMassive changes were made to the grounds of the north side of the stadium with the addition of a of Champions. Building the Walk of Champions required the demolition of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity house and the grading of the hill it sat upon. The Walk of Champions comprises a brick plaza leading from University Boulevard to the north end zone entrances. The plaza features 16 granite monuments set into the walkway commemorating the Crimson Tide's SEC and national championship teams throughout the years. Along the west side of the plaza are five roughly , tall bronze statues, one for each Alabama football coach who has led the Crimson Tide to a national championship. Each statue has a semicircular wall behind it bearing the coach's name and the year(s) that he led the team to a national championship. The first four statues, unveiled during the opening in 2006, included Wallace Wade, Frank Thomas, Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, and Gene Stallings. The fifth statue, that of Nick Saban, was unveiled prior to the A-Day game on April 16, 2011. It commemorates Saban guiding Alabama to its 13th National Championship with a 37–21 win over the Texas Longhorns.\nFinally, there is a bronze statuary group of two anonymous Alabama football players at the entrance to the north end zone, with the one on the left holding a large Alabama Crimson Tide flag upright on a flagpole. This player is wearing the number 18 and a helmet, with the player on the right wearing the number 92 and pointing into the distance. The jersey numbers represent 1892, the first season of Crimson Tide football.\n\nThe north end zone was opened for the 2006 season opener versus Hawaii, which set a new record attendance of 92,138. The Crimson Tide was victorious, 25–17.\n\nThe University of Alabama Board of Trustees approved a study for further expansion of Bryant–Denny on September 19, 2008. The Physical Properties Committee of the University of Alabama Board of Trustees heard a presentation from the UA athletic department on November 13, 2008 regarding the proposed $80.6 million expansion of the south end zone upper deck and suite level of Bryant–Denny Stadium. The proposed expansion would bring the stadium's capacity to approximately 101,600, therefore making it the second largest stadium in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and the fifth largest stadium in college football. The committee unanimously approved the project to move into the third of four stages, the fourth being final approval to begin construction.\n\nOn February 6, 2009, the university's Board of Trustees voted unanimously and without discussion to give the final approval for construction to commence on the south end zone expansion. With the approval of the Board of Trustees, construction began in the Spring of 2009 and continued throughout the 2009 football season. The expansion was finished in time for the first game of the team's 2010 season.\n\n\"The Tuscaloosa News\" reported on April 17, 2009 that due to the economic climate and resultant lowered construction costs, the stadium expansion cost $15 million less than expected, coming in around $65.6 million.\nThe expanded south end zone now includes a two level South Zone club with a total of 1,700 seats and 36 skyboxes to bring the total number of skyboxes in Bryant–Denny Stadium to 159, as well as an 8,500 seat upper deck. The entire stadium's audio/visual system was upgraded to include two new video boards in both corners of the south end zone.\n\nPrior to the 2009 season, the large south scoreboard was disassembled to make way for the construction of the new stadium expansion. During this process, some welding equipment started a fire that burned the inside of the scoreboard. Also, during this time, four new play clocks and down/distance indicators were installed (one behind each corner of the end zones) and a new LED game clock was placed behind the south goalpost.\n\nThe expansion was completed in mid-summer 2010 and held an official capacity of 101,821 making it the fifth largest college football stadium in the country. The new seats were all sold out quickly for the entire 2010 football season. In the future, the new expansion will include stores and other extras on the bottom of the end zone.\n\nThe University is planning a full stadium expansion with construction expand to begin at the start of the 2020 season. \n\nSince its opening in 1929 through 2010, the Crimson Tide owns a record at Bryant–Denny Stadium. Bear Bryant is the leader in wins at the stadium, with an all-time record of in his quarter century as Tide head coach.\nDespite its success at Bryant–Denny, most of Alabama's \"home\" football history from the 1920s through the 1980s occurred at Birmingham's Legion Field. Well into the late 1990s, the higher capacity Legion Field hosted most of Alabama's important home games, including the Iron Bowl with rival Auburn, which was considered a neutral site from 1948 through 1987. The Crimson Tide hosted Tennessee in odd-numbered years in Birmingham until 1999, and LSU in even-numbered years from 1964 through 1986, except for 1980. Usually, Bryant–Denny hosted three or four games per season, mostly non-conference games, although the Tide always played Mississippi State in Tuscaloosa, save for 1987, due to the close distance between Tuscaloosa and Starkville. However, in 1998, when Bryant–Denny was expanded to a capacity exceeding Legion Field, the more important home games started to move to Bryant–Denny, culminating with the move of the Tennessee series to Tuscaloosa in 1999 and the Iron Bowl a year later. From 1998 to 2003, Alabama continued to play two or three minor games in Birmingham. Finally, in 2003, Alabama played its final game at Legion Field against the South Florida Bulls, and now Bryant–Denny is the sole home of Alabama football.\nHowever, despite the majority of past big games being played at Legion Field, Bryant–Denny Stadium has hosted many memorable games, such as the 1994 shootout between Alabama's Jay Barker and Georgia's Eric Zeier, Marvin Constant's goal-line stop against LSU quarterback Josh Booty as time expired in 1999, Tyrone Prothro's reception over the back of Southern Miss defensive back Jasper Faulk in 2005, a 31–3 victory over No. 5 Florida in 2005, the Roman Harper-forced fumble against Tennessee in 2005 that helped the Crimson Tide to victory, Alabama's 36–0 shutout victory against Auburn in 2008 thus breaking the six-game losing streak and first ever Iron Bowl victory in Bryant–Denny Stadium, and Terrence Cody's field goal block against Tennessee as time expired in 2009. In recent years, Bryant–Denny Stadium has become a feared place to play again. Also Bryant-Denny has been put on many lists ranking it one of the best places to watch football. NCAA Football 11 ranked Alabama's Bryant–Denny as the fourth toughest place to play in the nation and third in the SEC behind Florida and LSU. \"Sporting News\" ranks it first while Bleacher Report has it ranked as the 5th toughest and the 2nd best stadium in the country.\n\nUntil the turn of the millennium, the field at Bryant–Denny Stadium had only the necessary markings required for play. As more and more stadiums began to add other designs to the field, such as logos, Alabama chose to remain traditional with the field design. In fact, even into the 2002 season, Bryant–Denny still had no logo at midfield and no logos at the 25-yard lines, which are now commonplace in many stadiums. The end zone design simply consisted of \"ALABAMA\" in a white, block-style font. During the 2002 season, however, a large white script “A” was added to midfield.\n\nThe field design underwent full-scale changes beginning with the 2004 season. At midfield, the large white script “A” was replaced with the crimson script “A” logo, encircled by a crimson ring which has \"Alabama Crimson Tide\" written around it. In addition, the end zone designs were changed to a crimson block-style font outlined in white.\n\nFor the 2006 season, two identical logos commemorating the 175th anniversary of the university were also added to the field on the 25-yard lines. One was added on the south end of the stadium, on the west side of the playing field, while the other was on the north end of the stadium, on the east side of the playing field.\nFor the 2007 season, two identical logos commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) were added to home field of every SEC team. These were in the same places as the 175th logos were during the 2006 season.\n\nFor the 2008 season, two identical SEC logos were added to the home field of every SEC team. Alabama’s crimson was used as the primary color for the logos at Bryant–Denny. These logos were located in the same places as the previous logos and remain there today.\n\nFor the 2009 A-day game, the end zones were changed back to the original white block-style font that was used prior to the 2004 season, except that the background was shaded crimson. The north end zone displayed \"ALABAMA\", while the south end zone displayed \"CRIMSON TIDE\". This design layout has remained in use since the 2009 season.\n\nFor the 2011 season, two identical houndstooth awareness ribbons recognizing the ongoing relief efforts following the April 27, 2011 tornado were added to the field on the 25 yard lines.\n\nIn 2008, the visitors' locker room was officially named \"The Fail Room\" after alumnus and donor James M. Fail. He commented, \"Earlier this year, when I saw the visitors' locker room as a potential naming right, I figured it was the most appropriate opportunity I would ever have to use my name.\"\n\nBeginning in 2009, Bryant–Denny Stadium and Auburn University's Jordan–Hare Stadium became the homes of the Alabama High School Athletic Association state football championship games, known as the Super Seven. Bryant-Denny hosts the Super Seven in odd-numbered years, with Jordan–Hare taking the games in even-numbered years. Previously, the Super Six was held at Legion Field in Birmingham.\n\n"}

{"id": "18448306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18448306", "title": "Chess title", "text": "Chess title\n\nA chess title is a title created by a chess governing body and bestowed upon players based on their performance and rank. Such titles are usually granted for life. The most prestigious titles are those granted by the international chess governing body FIDE; many national chess federations also grant titles such as \"National Master\".\n\nIn general, a \"chess master\" is a player of such skill that he or she can usually beat most amateurs. Among chess players, the term is often abbreviated to \"master\", the meaning being clear from context.\n\nThe establishment of the world chess body, Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE), saw the creation of titles superior to the \"national master\" titles. In 1950, FIDE created the titles \"Grandmaster\" and \"International Master\", the requirements for which were increasingly formalized over the years. In 1978 FIDE created the lesser title of \"FIDE Master\".\n\nFrom the beginning of recorded chess, to the establishment of the first chess organizations, the term \"master\" was applied informally, being simply a matter of popular acclaim. Strong players demonstrated their strength in play, and gained the informal reputation of being chess masters.\n\nAs chess became more widespread in the latter half of the 19th century, the term began to be given out by organizations. One of the most prestigious events of the time was the DSB Congress, first organised by the Deutscher Schachbund (German Chess Federation) in 1876. The DSB's standard for the title of Master was the \"Meisterdrittel\", i.e. to win at least one third of the games in the premiere tournament at a DSB Congress. The winner of the \"Hauptturnier\" or \"reserve\" event was entitled to compete in the premiere event in the next congress, with a chance to achieve the \"Meisterdrittel\".\n\nAll the titles listed above are open to men and women. Separate women-only titles, such as Woman Grandmaster (WGM), are also available. Beginning with Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978, many women have also earned the unsegregated GM title.\n\nSome national chess federations award titles such as \"National Master\" (NM). National chess federations are free to set whatever standards they want for such titles, which are not recognized by FIDE. Standards for \"Master\" titles in different countries vary, but are usually based on criteria such as achieving a certain rating (typically about 2200 Elo), achieving the required number of tournament performances (\"norms\") at a certain level, or featuring prominently in the country's national championship. In some cases, it may extend to honorary titles awarded to (for example) prominent chess administrators, business patrons or politicians. Since the introduction of the FIDE Master (FM) title in 1978, some federations such as those of Ireland and Germany have ceased awarding National Master titles, apparently regarding them as obsolete.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the Master title was conferred by the federal government and was connected to the title of Master of Sport. The first chess player to receive the title was Peter Romanovsky in 1934. Only players who featured prominently in the Soviet Chess Championship were considered for the title, and less than 100 awards were made altogether. The majority of these players also qualified for the FIDE International Master or Grandmaster title.\n\nThe USCF currently gives a national title for achieving 2200 rating (life master):\n\nChess expert is a title given by the United States Chess Federation (USCF). It is awarded to chess players rated from 2000 to 2199. Players rated above that are masters, while players below that are class players. Approximately 50,000 chess players have USCF ratings, of which approximately 2,500 are rated 2000 or better. Thus, chess experts are in the top 5% of all USCF tournament chess players. Since 2008, USCF has also awarded Candidate Master titles to players that achieve 5 performance-based 'norms' in tournaments while holding a rating above 2000. Like the title of Master, Candidate Master titles are awarded for life.\n\nThe title of chess expert is not awarded for life. Every time a tournament chess player plays a game, his rating goes up or down depending on the game's outcome and on how strong his opponent is. If the rating of a chess expert falls below 2000, he is not a chess expert any more (though he retain the title of Candidate Master, if it was earned according to criteria above). This is in contrast to international titles awarded by FIDE, which are awarded for life. In European countries the term of \"expert\" is not used. Instead, players of that level are called \"Candidate Masters\", although the FIDE Candidate Master title generally requires a higher rating (2200 FIDE).\n\nIt is possible (and common), however, for players in the United States to have a rating that places them in the 'expert' category while still retaining the title of 'Life Master' or 'National Master'. The 'title' of 'master' is awarded to anyone meeting the criteria laid down by the USCF, including having once been rated over 2200. Like the FIDE titles of FIDE Master, International Master, and Grandmaster, the title of 'Master' is awarded for life. Players with a rating below 2200, but who have earned the title of 'National Master' or 'Life Master', are, according to the USCF, still referred to as 'masters'.\n\nThe first USCF rating list was published in December 1950. On that list, experts were players rated from 2100 to 2300 and masters were players rated from 2300 to 2500. However, within a few years, it was discovered that the ratings were rapidly deflating. As a result, the classifications were dropped by 100 points so that since then experts were rated between 2000 and 2200. In 1960, the USCF adopted the new Elo rating system replacing the original Harkness System. There have been continuous adjustments to that system ever since, with the primary purpose of stabilizing the rating system against the forces of inflation and deflation, so that a chess expert today will be approximately the same strength as a chess expert was 20 or 40 years ago.\n\nThis information stated here also applies in Canada, under the auspices of the Canadian Federation of Chess (CFC), with one difference being that Class E encompasses all players rated under 1200. Similar class distinctions may apply in other national chess federations as well.\n\nThe United States Chess Federation (USCF) awards the Title of National Master to anyone who achieves a USCF rating of 2200, and the title of Senior Master to anyone who achieves a USCF rating of 2400 along with certain performance-based 'norms' during tournament play. The USCF also awards the Life Master title to anyone who holds a 2200 rating for a total of 300 or more games in his or her lifetime.\n\nIn the United States, the title of \"National Master\" is awarded for life, regardless of whether the rating of a National Master subsequently goes below 2200. In August 2002, this position was codified (after being recognized as the existing status quo) by the USCF Policy Board with the passage of a motion stating \"Any USCF member who has had a regular post tournament rating of 2200 or higher (published or not) has demonstrated a significant level of chess ability and is recognized by being automatically awarded the lifetime title of National Master.\"\n\nLife Master is a chess title awarded by the United States Chess Federation (USCF). To be awarded this title, one must hold a master's rating of over 2200 for at least 300 USCF-rated tournament chess games. \n\nDuring the 1990s, the USCF also awarded a \"Life Master\" title on the basis of a different and more complex system that was similar to the FIDE 'norm system' of awarding titles. This method of attaining Life Master became officially recognized by the USCF on January 1, 1996. The \"class norm\" system was later discontinued, and players who had or were subsequently granted the title on the 300-game basis were renamed \"Original Life Masters.\" In practice, the distinction is rarely made. Original Life Masters had to play 300 games as a Master with out going below 2200 in their rating or the count would start over again. \n\nAs the name of this title implies, this title is held for life, regardless of any subsequent decrease in rating. Thus it is possible to have a player with a USCF rating of 2100 (or below) who is a Life Master. While this is uncommon for 'Original Life Masters' (since such a rating floor can only be dropped by the USCF itself), Original Life Masters have a floor rating of 2200 .\n\nThe Chess Federation of Canada awards the title of National Master to players who achieve a national rating of 2200, and three tournament performances (\"norms\") of 2300 or more. It also awards National Woman Master and National Candidate Master titles.\n\nThe English Chess Federation awards the title of National Master to players who achieve an ECF rating of 200 or more (equivalent to a FIDE rating of approximately 2250). It also awards a number of lesser titles.\n\nUp until 1991, the Irish Chess Federation awarded the title of Irish National Master to 15 players. The title has since fallen into disuse.\n\nThe title of Australian Master was introduced in 1959, and was awarded by the Australian Chess Federation using a points based system, in which players were required to score 100 points from performances in major tournaments such as the Australian Chess Championship and state championships. According to Australian chess player and arbiter Shaun Press, the requirements were changed to a rating-based system some time during the 1980s, but the title was not held in high regard and is no longer awarded.\n\nThe New Zealand Chess Federation awards the title of National Master using a points based system, based on performances in the New Zealand Chess Championship and a few other tournaments. 100 points are required for the title of National Master, and 40 points for the title of Candidate Master. As of 31 January 2013, 22 players hold the National Master title, the majority of whom also have FIDE titles.\n\nJust as in over-the-board play, in problem chess the titles International Grandmaster, International Master and FIDE Master are awarded by FIDE via the PCCC (\"Permanent Commission for Chess Composition\") for especially distinguished problem and study composers and solvers (unlike over-the-board chess, however, there are no women-only equivalents to these titles in problem chess).\n\nFor composition, the title of Grandmaster for chess composition was established in 1959, with André Cheron, Arnoldo Ellerman, Alexander Gerbstmann, Jan Hartong, and Cyril Kipping being the first honorary recipients. In subsequent years, qualification for the IM title, as well as for the GM title (first awarded in 1972 to Genrikh Kasparyan, Lev Loshinsky, Comins Mansfield, and Eeltje Visserman) and the FM title (first awarded 1990) has been determined on the basis of the number of problems or studies a composer had selected for publication in the FIDE Albums. These albums are collections of the best problems and studies composed in a particular three-year period, as selected by FIDE-appointed judges. Each problem published in an album is worth 1 point; each study is worth 1⅔; joint compositions are worth the same divided by the number of composers. For the FIDE Master title, a composer must accumulate 12 points; for the International Master title, 25 points are needed; and for the Grandmaster title, a composer must have 70 points.\n\nFor solvers, the GM (International Solving Grandmaster) and IM titles were both first awarded in 1982; the FM title followed in 1997. GM and IM titles can only be gained by participating in the official World Chess Solving Championship (WCSC): to become a GM, a solver must score at least 90 percent of the winner's points and on each occasion finish in at least tenth place three times within ten successive WCSCs. For the IM title they must score at least 80 percent of the winner's points and each time finish in at least fifteenth place twice within five successive WCSCs; alternatively, winning a single WCSC or scoring as many points as the winner in a single WCSC will earn the IM title. For the FM title, the solver must score at least 75 percent of the winners points and each time finish within the top 40 percent of participants in any two PCCC-approved solving competitions.\n\nThe title International Judge of Chess Compositions is given to individuals considered capable of judging composing tournaments at the highest level.\n\nThe International Correspondence Chess Federation (ICCF) awards the titles International Master, Senior International Master and International Correspondence Chess Grandmaster—these are equivalent to similar titles awarded by FIDE for over-the-board chess. The ICCF also runs the World Correspondence Chess Championships. Because these events can last a long time, they may overlap: for instance, in February 2005 Joop van Oosterom was declared winner of the eighteenth Championship (which began in June 2003), though the winner of the seventeenth Championship (which began in March 2002) had not yet been determined.\n\n"}

{"id": "15617261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15617261", "title": "Horse jumping obstacles", "text": "Horse jumping obstacles\n\nVarious obstacles are found in competitive sports involving horse jumping. These include show jumping, hunter, and the cross-country phase of the equestrian discipline of eventing. The size and type of obstacles vary depending on the course and the level of the horse and rider, but all horses must successfully negotiate these obstacles in order to complete a competition. Fences used in hunter and eventing are generally made to look relatively rustic and natural.\n\nIn jumping competition, they are often brightly colored and creatively designed. In hunter and jumper competition, obstacles are constructed to fall down if struck by the horse. In eventing, they are built to be solid, though for safety, certain elements may be designed to break away if hit.\n\nAlso called chevrons, these fences are shaped like triangles, with the point facing towards the ground. They are generally very narrow, usually only a few feet wide. Arrowhead fences require the rider to keep their horse straight between their hands and legs, as it is easy for a run-out to occur due to the narrowness of the fence. These fences are often used in combination with other obstacles to increase their difficulty, such as right after a bank or as the second obstacle in a bending line. This tests the rider's ability to regain control of his/her horse following an obstacle.\n\nThese jumps are steps up or down from one level to another, and can be single jumps or built as a \"staircase\" of multiple banks. Banks up require large amounts of impulsion, although not speed, from the horse. The drop fence incorporates a down bank. Both types of banks require the rider to be centered over the horse. Down banks require the rider to lean further back, with slipped reins and heels closer to the front of the horse, in order to absorb the shock of the landing.\n\nA bounce, also called a no-stride, is a fence combination sometimes found on the cross-country course of eventing. It is also very commonly used in grid-work or gymnastics. It consists of two fences placed close together so the horse cannot take a full stride between them, but not so close that the horse would jump both fences at once. The horse \"bounces\" between the two jumps, landing with his hind legs before immediately taking off with his front legs. The distance between the two usually is 7–8 feet for small ponies; 9 ft for large ponies or small horses; and 9.5–11 ft for horses. A bounce (or several can be used in a row for more advanced horses) teaches the horse good balance, to push off with his hind end, and to fold his front end well. It can also be used to slow down a speedy horse, as a horse cannot go flying over a bounce (he/she will knock a rail) as he could with a single jump.\n\nThese jumps consist of a solid base with brush placed on top, generally low enough for the horse to see over. The horse is supposed to jump through the brush in a flat jump, rather than over the top of it in a more rounded arc. Brush fences are also used for steeplechase racing. This type of fence is closely related to the bullfinch. Sometimes the fence is painted to camouflage in with the brush, so it is unseen by both horse and rider.\n\nThis fence has a solid base with several feet of brush protruding out of the top of the jump up to six feet high. The horse is supposed to jump through the brush, rather than over it. Due to the height of the brush, the horse generally cannot see the landing. This tests the horse's trust in the rider, as the horse must depend on the rider to guide it carefully and steer it to a solid landing. The horse must be taught to jump calmly through the brush, as attempting to jump over the brush could lead to a refusal, a run-out at the next fence, or a misstep and possible injury. Bullfinches must be approached positively, with lots of impulsion, in order to prevent stops. When jumping a bullfinch, the rider must stay tight in the saddle so that brush cannot be caught between his or her leg and the fence.\n\nAlso called the rails-ditch-rails, the coffin is a combination fence where the horse jumps a set of rails, moves one or several strides downhill to a ditch, then goes back uphill to another jump. In the past, coffins were more pronounced, with up and down banks leading to the ditch in the middle. However, today only the former type with the rails is seen. The coffin is intended to be jumped in a slow, impulsive canter (known to eventers as a \"coffin canter\" for that reason). This canter gives the horse the power and agility to negotiate the obstacle, and also allows him the time needed to assess what question is being asked, so that he may better complete the combination without problem. Approaching in a fast, flat gallop will cause miss striding and may entice a refusal from the horse. Going too fast may also result in a fall, if the horse cannot physically make a stride between the obstacles.\n\nThese fences are combinations of banks, logs, water, ditches and other elements. All of the jumps are placed within 1–3 strides of each other, and are meant to be jumped as a series in a specific order. Also see Normandy bank, Sunken road, and Coffin. They are seen in the equestrian jumping sports of show jumping and eventing (both the cross-country and stadium jumping phases), but are uncommon in hunt seat competition.\n\nCombinations are often one of the challenges of a course, and the course designer knows how to manipulate the distances and types of obstacles to make them more difficult.\n\nCombinations are named by their number of elements. Double and triple combinations are the most common. In general, the more elements involved, the more difficult the obstacle. However, other variables can greatly influence the difficulty:\n\n\nTo negotiate a combination successfully, a rider must maintain the qualities needed in all riding: rhythm, balance, and impulsion as they approach the fence. They must also have a great understanding of their horse's stride length, so that they may know how much they need to shorten or lengthen it for each particular combination.\n\nBefore riding the course, the rider should walk the distances of the combination and decide the stride from which they should jump it.\n\nAlso called an apex, corner fences are in a triangular shape with the horse jumping over one corner of the triangle. They are similar to the \"fan\" jump seen in show-jumping. As the name suggests, the fence makes a \"V\" shape, that can have an angle up to 90 degrees. At novice levels, the fence is formed by two angled fences, open in the center while more advanced designs have a solid triangular cover. The corner is meant to be jumped on a line perpendicular to an imaginary bisecting line of the angle, and as close to the narrow apex as possible while still far enough in on the jump that the horse knows he is supposed to go over it. If the rider aims too far toward the wider section of the obstacle, it may be too wide for the horse to clear it. This usually results in a stop or run out, although some of the braver horses might \"bank\" a solid corner fence (touching down on it before quickly jumping off). This is not desirable, as the horse is more likely to slip, catch a leg, or fall. If the rider aims too far toward the apex, it is very easy for the horse to run right past, especially if is unsure as to whether he is to jump the obstacle. Due to their relative difficulty, the corner is not seen at the lowest levels. The corner is a precision fence, requiring accurate riding and good training, with the horse straight and between the rider's aids. Due to the build of the fence, an uncommitted horse and rider pair may have a run-out at this type of obstacle. It is best that the rider use their aids to \"block\" the horse from running out to the side, with a strong contact to prevent the shoulders from popping, and a supporting leg.\n\nThese fences are dropped areas in the course that may be up to 11 feet 10 inches wide in advanced competition, although they are seen at lesser widths at all levels of competition. They can be used individually, or in combinations such as the coffin and trakehner fences. Ditches should be ridden positively, with increased stride length and forward motion. The rider should always focus ahead, rather than looking down into the ditch, to keep their balance aligned correctly and allow the horse to give their best effort.\n\nThese fences ask the horse to jump over a log fence and land at a lower level than the one at which they took off. They are closely related to the bank fences. Many riders have fallen badly on drop fences if the horse swerves unexpectedly. Jumping drop fences places a good deal of stress on the horse's legs, and therefore practice should be kept to a minimum. To help minimise the concussion on the horse's legs, the rider should encourage it to jump the fence as conservatively as possible, with little bascule or speed, using just enough power to safely clear the log before dropping down.\n\nDrop fences require a great deal of trust of the horse in the rider, because often the animal can not see the landing until it is about to jump. It is important for the rider to keep their leg on to the base, and not \"drop\" the horse before the fence, as this may result in a refusal. In the air, the rider usually allows their shoulders to move slightly forward, and lifts their seatbones off the saddle until the peak of the jump. However, as the horse descends, the rider should allow their upper body to open, keeping their body relatively upright (especially if the drop is large). If the rider continues to lean forward on landing, it is much more likely that they will topple forward and become unseated when the horse touches the ground, due to the momentum. This is especially true with drops because the landing is almost always slightly downhill, as this helps reduce concussion on the horse's legs. The rider must also be sure to slip their reins as the horse descends, allowing the horse the freedom to stretch its neck forward and down. Many riders, especially those who have only jumped in the ring, believe cross-country riders to be falling backward (or getting \"left behind\") when they jump a drop fence. However, it is important to note that more security is needed when jumping this type of fence than is typically required when jumping in a level arena. Additionally, the fences are solid, so the rider need not worry about dropping a rail (as would typically happen if he began sitting up too soon when riding fence in show jumping). The rider is not trying to encourage a great bascule from the horse. Although it may appear that the rider is getting left behind, a properly ridden drop fence will keep the rider centered over the horse, and still provide him enough freedom to comfortably negotiate the obstacle.\n\nLog fences are obstacles that are jumped in equestrian competition, including in the cross-country phase of eventing and in hunter paces. Additionally, they may be met when fox hunting. They are the most common type of cross-country fence, includes oxers, log piles, vertical, and triple bar obstacles. The approach of these fences varies according to the height and width of the obstacle and the terrain.\n\nLog fences differ from the usual equestrian jump, which involves removable poles set in jump cups that are attached to a standard, because they are solid and do not fall down. Therefore, the horse may touch the fence, and even scramble over it, without penalty.\n\nHowever, the fact that they are solid increases the risk that horse and rider will be injured if they make a mistake: the horse may hit it so hard that the rider is launched from the saddle or the horse may stumble over it and fall on landing. In the worst-case scenario, a horse may hit the fence on his forearms, and somersault over it, which risks injury to the horse and especially the rider if the horse lands on him/her. Therefore, the rider must be especially proficient before attempting solid fences, to ensure he can approach them properly. Additionally, most riders get into a slightly more defensive seat when jumping log fences, and do not raise out of the saddle as high or fold as much, which will allow them to stay in the saddle if their horse accidentally hits the fences and stumbles on landing. This position is considered a fault when jumping show jumping fences, because the horse is always encouraged to bascule over the fence to help prevent him from touching and knocking the rails, and keeping the weight on his back encourages him to drop it instead. However, a \"slightly\" defensive position is not only acceptable when riding over solid obstacles, but in most cases ideal.\n\nHorses will generally jump log fences quite well, as they look natural to the animal. It is best when designing and jumping such fences, however, to only ride over obstacles that have a larger log (rather than a thin, stick-like pole) as the horse will respect the jump and is more likely to jump it cleanly and boldly. Due to the risks, it is especially important to jump log fences in a forward manner with plenty of impulsion and good balance.\n\nA Normandy bank is a combination of obstacles. A ditch precedes the bank, so the horse must jump over the ditch and onto the bank in one leap. There is also a solid fence on the top of the bank, which may produce a drop fence to get off the obstacle, or may allow for a stride off.\n\nBecause this obstacle incorporates several different types of obstacles into one, it is considered quite difficult and is usually not seen until the upper levels. The rider not only has to worry about a bold jump over the ditch and onto the bank, but also the obstacle on the top of the bank and the quick jump off.\n\nAn oxer is a type of horse jump with two rails that may be set even or uneven. The width between the poles may vary. Some shows do not have oxers in the lower show jumping divisions.\n\nThere are several types of oxers:\n\nThese jumps have a rounded half-barrel appearance on top. They can be quite wide at upper levels, and often govern respect from the horse, but are not usually considered a \"scary\" fence for horses on course and generally produce a good jump. A modified version of the rolltop is sometimes seen in hunter and showjumping classes.\n\nThese fences have a top log rail, with an inverted triangle of logs pointing downwards, resembling a shark's top jaw.\n\nA \"skinny\" is any fence with a narrow face. These require accurate riding and the ability to keep the horse straight, as it is easy for a horse to \"glance off\" such narrow obstacles. Combinations involving skinnies become increasingly common as the rider moves up the levels because they reduce the degree of error that is available if the rider is to successfully negotiate the fence.\n\nThese jumps are solid walls made out of stone or a similar material. They sometimes have logs placed on top to make them larger or change the appearance.\n\nThese are combination jumps involving banks and rails. At the lower levels, it may consist of a bank down, with a few strides to a bank up. At the upper levels, the sunken road often is quite complicated, usually beginning with a set of rails, with either one stride or a bounce distance before the bank down, a stride in the \"bottom\" of the road before jumping the bank up, and another stride or bounce distance before the final set of rails. Sunken roads are very technical, especially at the upper levels, and require accurate riding. A bad approach or extravagant jump in can possibly ruin the rider's distances, which may result in a stop from the horse, or a fall. Additionally, the quick change in the type of obstacle, from upright fence, to down bank, to upbank, makes it physically difficult for rider and horse. It thus requires that both horse and rider are balanced, and that the rider stays centered and follows the motion of their mount.\n\nA table is a fence with height and width, with the top of the table being one piece of material (unlike an open oxer, which is not \"filled in\"). The horse is encouraged to jump over the entire obstacle at once, similar to an oxer, however there are times where the animal may accidentally touch down on, or \"bank,\" the top. Because of this, tables should be built strongly enough to support the horse landing on it.\n\nTables are also usually built so that the back part is slightly higher than the front, or with a piece of wood at the back, so the horse can easily see that there is width to the obstacle and therefore judge it appropriately.\n\nTables can get extremely wide, and generally test the horse's scope. They are intended to be jumped at a forward pace and a slightly long stride.\n\nThese fences consist of a rail over a ditch. The ditch can be frightening for the horse, and so this type of jump is a test of bravery. Trakehners are first seen at training level (United States), and at the higher levels they can be quite large. \n\nA Faux (False) Trakehner is a mobile cross-country jump designed to look like a trakehner by using heavy posts or poles on the ground to simulate the front and back edges of the ditch.\n\nTrakehners were originally fencelines that were built in drainage ditches. The Trakehnen area of East Prussia, originally wetlands, was drained by the Prussian kings in the 17th and 18th centuries, before a horse breeding program was begun. The Main Stud Trakehnen, which produced the Trakehner breed of horse, was established on the land in 1732. The large drainage ditches, with fencelines in the bottom of them, were later used as a test for the 3-year-olds for suitability for breeding and war mounts. Due to the build of the fence, the take-off spot for the horse was on the downside of the ditch, and the landing was on the upside. However, the old-style trakehner jump is not seen today, mainly because the landing was on an uphill grade, which was very punishing to the horses, even when the horse took off well. The ditch is now revetted, and the fence does not have an uphill landing.\n\nIn 1973, Rachael Bayliss and her horse, Gurgle the Greek, \"cleared\" a trakehner at the Badminton Horse Trials by going under it. The rules were changed after this incident, requiring the horse not only to go between the flags but also to pass over the log.\n\nThese fences range in difficulty from simple water crossings at lower levels to combinations of drop fences into water, obstacles or \"islands\" within the water, and bank or obstacles out of the water at upper levels. The water may be no more than 14 inches deep.\n\nWater, due to the drag it places on the horse, makes water obstacle rides different from those without the water. Drop fences in can cause the rider to come flying off on landing if he or she is not in a defensive position. The stride of the horse is shortened, which must be taken into account when designing and riding obstacles within the water. Fences within the water need to be ridden with a good deal of impulsion.\n\nAdditionally, some horses are cautious of water, and require a strong ride. Experience and confidence-building training can help to lessen any timidity from the horse.\n\nWater is often used in equestrian events as an obstacle for jumping. The water complex on a course may be as simple as a water crossing at the lowest levels of eventing, to a combination involving several jumps into and out of water at the highest levels. At all levels, however, the footing of the complex should be firm, and it is important for the competitor to walk into the water during the course walk to test the footing and deepness of the water, and any drop-off areas in the complex. If your horse does not go into water you will have a problem at almost every event you go to. In show jumping, water is never meant to be run through but rather jumped over, and a foot in the water will count as a fault to the rider's score.\n\nUSEA rules state (2005) that water may be no more than 14\" deep.\n\nWater crossings often include a bank or, at higher levels, a drop fence into the water . There may be a fence or a bank complex in the water, and a bank out, possibly to another fence. Water is often a challenge on the cross-country course, and there are usually several riders at the largest events who get \"dunked\" when they reach the obstacle\n\nThere are two types of water jumps used in show jumping:\n\n\n"}

(Retd) Sarpartap Singh and major World Tent Pegging Promoter Mr. Ahmad Afsar, in consultation with H.H. Prince Malik Atta Khan of Pakistan, pushed a meeting for all representatives of 17 countries that were participating in the World Equestrian Tent Pegging Championship in India. \n\nThis meeting marked the beginning of Unification of Tent Pegging playing countries of the world. India through its major organiser, Equiwings Sports had sustainable conducted International and Asian Equestrian Tent Pegging Championships in 2010, 2012 prior to the World event in 2013. Mr. Ahmad Afsar's first lecture for formation of Equestrian Tent Pegging Federation was recognition of the Thrilling Sport of Tent Pegging as an Olympic discipline from International Equestrian Federation (FEI) and International Olympic Council (IOC)\n\nFollowing the meeting, in Oman on 27 October 2013 on request of the head of FEI Group 7 countries the organisation changed its name to the “International Tent Pegging Federation”.\nAt its founding, the ITPF had 29 member countries: Afghanistan, Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Germany, India, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Namibia, Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, UK, USA, and Yemen.\n\nThe executive committee was elected on 27 October 2013 and stand for 4 years.\n\n\n\nThe ITPF World Cup takes place throughout the world with qualifying members leading to a final event. After the formation of the federation, the world body decided to launch its own World Cup competition. The first and the inaugural Tent Pegging World Cup was organised by the Oman Equestrian Federation (OEF) at Al Rahba Farm, Barka, Oman from March 31 to April 4, 2014. The participant countries were Pakistan, Oman, Qatar, Yemen, Iraq, Egypt, South Africa, Britain and Australia who qualified the Sudan and Pakistan qualifying events in January and February respectively.\n\nSouth Africa won the event by a total of 758.5 points and clinch the enviable honour of being the first world champions. Oman got second position with 693.5 points. Sudan, who finished with 654 points, took the third place.\n\n2014 FEI World Equestrian Games were held at Normandy, France from 23 August from 7 September by the FEI. The FEI had invited the Vice President of International Tent Pegging Federation Malik Ata Muhammad Khan with full tent pegging team to give a demonstration of tent pegging to all the equestrian players who came there from all over the world. Malik Ata taugh them the basics of tent pegging, rules, methods how tent pegging is done. Haroon Bandial, Namdar Rehmat, Syed Wamiq Shah and Raja Zarrar Sajjad were part of the team.\n\n"}

It was an organisation supported by social democratic parties and International Federation of Trade Unions. Workers' Olympiads were an alternate event for the Olympic Games. The participants were members of various labor sports associations and came mostly from Europe. Nowadays the CSIT World Sports Games are the successor sports events of the International Workers' Olympiads. The \"World Sports Games\" is the main highlight and a new Brand of the CSIT. It is a unique major sports event for thousands of workers and amateurs every two years. The CSIT (International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation) is an international Multi-Sports Organization.\n\nThe Workers' Olympiads were created as a counterweight for the Olympic Games, which were criticized for being confined for the upper social classes and privileged people. The international workers' sports movement did not believe that the true Olympic spirit could be achieved in an Olympic movement dominated by the aristocratic leadership. Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, had always opposed women's participation and supported the cultural superiority of white Europeans over other races. His followers, Henri de Baillet-Latour and Avery Brundage, were openly anti-semitic and both collaborated with the Nazis. On the contrary, the Workers' Olympiads opposed all kinds of chauvinism, sexism, racism and social exclusiveness. The Olympic Games were based in rivalry between the nations, but the Workers' Olympiads stressed internationalism, friendship, solidarity and peace.\n\nThe Lucerne Sport International (later known as Socialist Workers' Sport International) was established in Lucerne, Switzerland in 1920. The first unofficial Workers' Olympiads were held a year later in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The IOC had banned the losing side of the World War I from the 1920 Summer Olympics (Germany even from the 1924 games), but the Workers's Olympiads were open for the \"enemy\" side as well. The number of participating countries was thirteen. The first official Worker's Olympiads were the 1925 winter games in the German town of Schreiberhau, which today is a part of Poland. They were followed by the first Summer Olympiads in Frankfurt am Main. \n\nNational flags were not used, but a red flag of international workers' movement. The best athletes were awarded with diplomas, they did not receive medals like in the Olympic Games. The visiting athletes stayed mostly at private accommodation of local families.\n\nInternational Workers' Olympiads were more than just a games for the top athletes. The festival was based on a mass participation, it did not restrict entry on the grounds of sporting ability. 1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad in Vienna was the largest event with the participation of 100,000 athletes from 26 countries. The Vienna Workers' Olympiad attracted some 250,000 spectators. It was much bigger event than the 1932 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles, both in number of participants as well as spectators. Praterstadion (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion) was constructed between 1929 and 1931 for the 1931 Olympiad. The last Workers' Olympiad at Antwerp in 1937 was a joint event with the Red Sport International organized Spartakiads.\n\nNote: the table below is incomplete. Only the participating countries of 1925 and 1937 Winter Olympiads and 1925 Summer Olympiads are correct.\n"}

{"id": "16190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16190", "title": "Jumping the broom", "text": "Jumping the broom\n\nJumping the broom (or jumping the besom) is a phrase and custom relating to a wedding ceremony where the couple jumps over a broom. \nIt has been suggested that the custom is based on an 18th-century idiomatic expression for \"sham marriage\", \"marriage of doubtful validity\"; it was popularized in the context of the introduction of civil marriage in Britain with the Marriage Act 1836.\n\nThere have also been suggestions that the expression may derive from an actual custom of jumping over a \"broomstick\" (where \"broom\" refers to the plant \"common broom\" rather than the household implement) associated with the Romani people of the United Kingdom, especially those in Wales.\n\nThe custom of a marrying couple literally jumping over a broom is now most widespread among African Americans, popularized in the 1970s by the novel and miniseries \"\" but originating in the mid 19th century as a practice in antebellum slavery in the United States.\n\nReferences to \"broomstick marriages\" emerged in England in the mid-to-late 18th century, always to describe a wedding ceremony of doubtful validity. The earliest use of the phrase is in the 1764 English edition of a French work: the French text, describing an elopement, refers to the runaway couple hastily making \"un mariage sur la croix de l'épée\" (literally ‘marriage on the cross of the sword’), an expression the English translator freely renders as ‘performed the marriage ceremony by leaping over a broomstick’.\n\nA 1774 usage in the \"Westminster Magazine\" also describes an elopement. A man who had taken his under-age bride off to France discovered it was as hard to arrange a legal marriage there as in England, but declined a suggestion that a French sexton might simply read the marriage service through before the couple as \"He had no inclination for a Broomstick-marriage\". In 1789 the rumoured clandestine marriage between the Prince Regent and Maria Fitzherbert is similarly referred to in a satirical song in \"The Times\": \"Their way to consummation was by hopping o’er a broom, sir\".\n\nDespite these allusions, research by the legal historian Professor R. Probert of Warwick University has failed to find any proof of an actual contemporary practice of jumping over a broomstick as a sign of informal union. Probert also points out that the word \"broomstick\" was used in the mid-18th century in several contexts to mean ‘something ersatz, or lacking the authority its true equivalent might possess.’ She therefore argues that because the expression \"broomstick marriage\", meaning 'sham marriage', was in circulation, folk etymology led to a belief that people must actually have once signified irregular marriage by jumping over a broom. Tyler D. Parry, Associate Professor of African American Studies, contests the claim that no literal jump was used in Britain, arguing that enslaved people of African descent and British migrants engaged in numerous cultural exchanges during the 18th and 19th centuries. He shows numerous correlations between the ceremonies of slaves and those of the rural British, contending it is not simply coincidental that two groups, separated by an ocean, utilized similar matrimonial forms revolving around the broomstick. If British practitioners never used a physical leap, Parry wonders how enslaved people in the US South learned of the custom.\n\nThere are later examples of the term \"broomstick marriage\" being used in Britain, always with a similar implication that the ceremony so performed did not create a legally binding union. This meaning survived into the early nineteenth century: during a case heard in London in 1824 regarding the legal validity of a marriage ceremony consisting of nothing more than the groom placing a ring on the bride's finger before witnesses, a court official commented that the ceremony \"amounted to nothing more than a broomstick marriage, which the parties had it in their power to dissolve at will.\"\n\nA decade later, the Marriage Act 1836, which introduced civil marriage, was contemptuously referred to as the ‘Broomstick Marriage Act’ by those who felt that a marriage outside the Anglican church did not deserve legal recognition. Some also began to use the phrase to refer to non-marital unions: a man interviewed in Mayhew's \"London Labour and the London Poor\" admitted: \"I never had a wife, but I have had two or three broomstick matches, though they never turned out happy.\"\n\nTinkers were said to have a similar custom of marriage called \"jumping the budget\", with the bride and groom jumping over a string or other symbolic obstacle.\n\nCharles Dickens' novel, \"Great Expectations\" (first published in serial form in the publication \"All the Year Round\" from 1 December 1860 to August 1861), contains a reference in chapter 48 to a couple having been married \"over the broomstick.\" The ceremony is not portrayed, but the reference indicates that the readers would have recognized this as referring to an informal, not a legally valid, agreement.\n\nIt has often been assumed that, in England, jumping over the broom (or sometimes walking over a broom), always indicated an irregular or non-church union (as in the expressions \"Married over the besom\", \"living over the brush\"), but there are examples of the phrase being used in the context of legal weddings, both religious and civil.\n\nOther sources have stepping over a broom as a test of chastity, while putting out a broom was also said to be a sign \"that the housewife’s place is vacant\" and a way, therefore, of advertising for a wife.\n\nIn America the phrase could be used as slang describing the act of getting married legally, rather than as specifying an informal union not recognised by church or state.\n\nIn Wales, Romani couples would get married by eloping, when they would \"jump the broom,\" or over a branch of flowering common broom or a besom made of broom. Welsh Kale and English Romanichals and Romanichal populations in Scotland practised the ritual into the 1900s.\n\nAccording to Alan Dundes (1996), the custom originated among Romani people in Wales (Welsh Kale) and England (Romanichal).\n\nC.W. Sullivan III (1997) in a reply to Dundes argued that the custom originated among the Welsh people themselves, known as \"priodas coes ysgub\" (\"besom wedding\"),\nSullivan's source is the Welsh folklorist Gwenith Gwynn (a.k.a. W. Rhys Jones), who assumed that the custom had once existed on the basis of conversations with elderly Welsh people during the 1920s, none of whom had ever seen such a practice. One had claimed that: \"It must have disappeared before I was born, and I am seventy-three\".\nGwynn's dating of the custom to the 18th century rested on the assumption that it must have disappeared before these elderly interviewees were born, and on his misreading of the baptism register of the parish of Llansantffraid Glyn Ceiriog.\nLocal variations of the custom were developed in different parts of England and Wales. Instead of placing the broom on the ground, and jumping together, the broom was placed in an angle by the doorway. The groom jumped first, followed by the bride. In southwest England, in Wales, and in the border areas between Scotland and England, \"[while some] couples ... agreed to marry verbally, without exchanging legal contracts[,] ... [o]thers jumped over broomsticks placed across their thresholds to officialize their union and create new households\", indicating that contractless weddings and jumping the broomstick were different kinds of marriage.\n\nIn some African-American communities, marrying couples will end their ceremony by jumping over a broomstick, either together or separately. This practice is well attested for as a marriage ceremony for slaves in the Southern United States in the 1840s and 1850s who were often not permitted to wed legally.\nIts revival in 20th century African American culture is due to the novel and miniseries \"\" (1976, 1977).\n\nAlan Dundes (1996) notes the unusual development of how \"a custom which slaves were \"forced\" to observe by their white masters has been revived a century later by African Americans as a treasured tradition\".\n\nThere have been occasional speculations to the effect that the custom may have origins in West Africa, but there is no direct evidence for this, although Dundes points to a custom of Ghana where brooms were waved above the heads of newlyweds and their parents. \nAmong southern Africans, who were largely not a part of the Atlantic slave trade, it represented the wife's commitment or willingness to clean the courtyard of the new home she had joined. Tyler D. Parry argues the Ghanaian connection is a weak case for its origins, especially considering the ritual used by slaves bears far more similarities to the custom in the British Isles. Parry argues that, despite the racial animus that characterized the US South in the nineteenth century, poor white southerners (many of them descendants of people who used irregular forms of matrimony in Britain) and enslaved people exchanged their cultures between one another at far greater rates than commonly acknowledged.\n\nSlave-owners were faced with a dilemma regarding committed relationships between slaves. While some family stability might be desirable as helping to keep slaves tractable and pacified, anything approaching a legal marriage was not. Marriage gave a couple rights over each other which conflicted with the slave-owners’ claims. Most marriages between enslaved blacks were not legally recognized during American slavery, as in law marriage was held to be a civil contract, and civil contracts required the consent of free persons. In the absence of any legal recognition, the slave community developed its own methods of distinguishing between committed and casual unions. \nThe ceremonial jumping of the broom served as an open declaration of settling down in a marriage relationship. Jumping the broom was always done before witnesses as a public ceremonial announcement that a couple chose to become as close to married as was then allowed.\n\nJumping the broom fell out of practice when blacks were free to marry legally. \nThe practice did survive in some communities, and the phrase \"jumping the broom\" was synonymous with \"getting married,\" even if the couple did not literally jump a broom. However, despite its smaller scale continuity in certain rural areas of the United States (among both black and white communities), it made a resurgence among African Americans after the publication of Alex Haley's \"\"\nDanita Rountree Green describes the African American custom as it stood in the early 1990s in her book \"Broom Jumping: A Celebration of Love\" (1992).\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter Brenda Lee released the rockabilly song \"Let's Jump the Broomstick\" on Decca Records in 1959.\nVia its association with Wales and the popular association of the broom with witches, the custom has also been adopted by some Wiccans.\n\nA film titled \"Jumping the Broom\", directed by Salim Akil, and starring Paula Patton & Laz Alonso was released on 6 May 2011.\n\nIn a 2013 episode of Grey's Anatomy, Miranda Bailey and Ben Warren jump over a broom at the conclusion of their wedding ceremony.\n\nIn the classic 1977 TV mini-series \"Roots\", Kunta Kinte/\"Toby\" (played by John Amos as adult Kunta Kinte - Levar Burton played the teenager Kunta Kinte) had a marriage ceremony where he and Belle (played by Madge Sinclair) jumped the broom.\n\nIn the 2016 film \"The Birth of a Nation\", a couple getting betrothed is seen jumping a broom.\n\nIn an episode of The Originals (season 2) (Episode 13 \"The Devil is Damned\") the custom is described as being necessary when a priest is not available and the wedding \"couldn't wait.\"\n\nThe custom has been reference twice by rap duo Outkast: in \"Call the Law\" on their 2006 album \"Idlewild\" and in 2007 song International Players Anthem (I Choose You).\n\n\n"}

In 2016, \"Newsweek\" called the Lunada Bay Boys \"America's most notorious surf gang\". The group's territorialism of the Lunada Bay public beach has caused controversy in the legal and surfing worlds. Although the Bay Boys are now often considered a gang, the group had non-violent beginnings in the 1960s as a self-described surfing \"family\" or fraternity.\n\nHistorically Lunada Bay had been considered an acclaimed big wave winter surf spot, with a right-hand break. The culture of Palos Verdes surfing clubs extends back as far the 1930s with groups such as the Palos Verdes Surfing Club.\n\nThe Lunada Bay Boys started in the 1960s as a fraternity of local surfers in the Palos Verdes region. An anonymous member stated, \"It was more like a big family. I wouldn’t call it a gang. We used to camp down there every other night. We would almost live down there.\" The group wasn't known for its localism during the 1960s, and surfers within the group were not as prone to violence. At the time, the Lunada Bay Boys wasn't the only surf crew in the city and neighbored the \"Portuguese Bend crew\" (Portuguese Bend Club) as well as the \"Haggerty's crew\" (Haggerty's Surfing Club) of their respective surf spots.\n\nAround the time, localism of surf spots was considered common sense due to outside surfers often causing boards to fall in the rocks due to lack of leashes at the time. Big wave surfing pioneer Greg Noll as well as U.S. champion Mike Purpus of Redondo Beach would surf with the Bay Boys in Lunada Bay during this era. The acclaim of Lunada Bay as a surf spot led to the creation of Lunada Bay Wetsuits in the late '60s. Mike Purpus and surfers Dewey Weber, Collie Ragland, Don Craig, and Donald Takayama would model for these Lunada Bay Wetsuits ads. Around this time, members would hang out on a rock ledge, however in the late 60s, a stone balcony was created on the shoreline of Lunada Bay, as a hangout for local surfers (often referred to as their \"fort\").\n\nIn the 1970s a leadership shift happened in which older members moved away, and newer members surfaced into leadership. Older members of the group were stated to have \"kept it safe and sane\", whereas the newer leadership began to hassle outsiders more directly. A surfer at Lunada Bay expressed that the reason violence escalated in years after was because the younger generation sought to show devotion to the territory in the presence of veteran members.\n\nIn the 1960s the Lunada Bay Boys culture was mostly nonviolent and held close alliances with the neighboring Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach. Activities of the original generation included camping down at the beach, fishing, diving, or shaping their surf boards in their shops. Becoming a member of the group was more relaxed and involved no more than to be a local.\n\nOne local told \"Stab\" magazine that approximately one quarter to one half of local surfers in Lunada Bay are members of the Lunada Bay Boys.\n\nCommon acts of localism by the Bay Boys include hassling people, intimidation, vandalizing vehicles, slashing tires, throwing rocks, and inciting violence against non-locals. A surfer at Lunada Bay expressed his feelings on localism stating, \"If we let every nice guy surf, there’d be a hundred guys out here. You have to nip it in the bud. The reason it’s not crowded is that people protect it. It’s fucked, dude. People think we’re a bunch of assholes, but you know what? We want to keep it like this so we can go somewhere where it’s fucking sacred.\"\n\nThe Palos Verdes Estates Police Department has been criticized for not taking effective legal action against the Lunada Bay Boys, with the \"LA Times\" reporting that \"city leaders repeatedly downplayed the alleged harassment by the Bay Boys against other surfers at Lunada Bay\". Palos Verdes Estates Police Chief Jeff Kepley has acknowledged that officers in his department \"may have relationships with surfers accused of tormenting outsiders.\"\n\nIn March 2016, surfer Diana Milena Reed and her lawyer sought an injunction against alleged members of the Lunada Bay Boys, to keep them from surfing at Lunada Bay. This lawsuit included claims of sexual harassment. The defendants denied Reed's allegations. Defendant Frank Ponce stated the claims were \"ridiculous\" and that \"there are no Bay Boys\".\n\n"}

Hopkins Architects of London was commissioned to design a new 37,000 seat stadium in Pimpri Chinchwad and the stadium was the result. As of 19 Aug, 2017 it has hosted 1 Test, 3ODIs and 2 T20Is. \n\nThe MCA Stadium was inaugurated in April 2012 by Shri Shantanu Sarnayak of Akola (the former health minister's grandson) and the first match was played between Kings XI Punjab and Pune Warriors in April 2012. The first Twenty20 International match at the stadium was played between India and England in December 2012. The first Test match at the venue was played between India and Australia in February 2017.\n\nThe MCA's decision to build a new Cricket stadium in Pune stemmed from a dispute with the Pune Municipal Corporation, regarding ticket allocations for Nehru Stadium.

Often, matches are abandoned due to heavy downpour. To overcome this problem, MCA opted for sand-based outfield developed departmentally with technical assistance from STRI Limited, UK. Due to this technology, even during heavy showers, water on the outfield drained out fast making it ready for play again just in few minutes.\n\nIn 2018 IPL, due to members of a few fringe political parties staging protests outside the M.

Despite tight security for the match against KKR, the Chennai police expressed their inability in ensuring enough personnel at the venue for the smooth conduct of the remaining games. MCA Stadium in Pune was selected to host remaining six home games of Chennai Super Kings\n\nIn October 2017 a stadium groundsman, Pandurang Salgaoncar, was sacked after video emerged of him allegedly agreeing to tamper with the wicket before a one-day international between India and New Zealand. \n\nThe sting operation was conducted by India Today TV. They captured Salgaoncar on camera allegedly stating he would prepare the pitch to suit two unnamed bowlers.\n\nThe second ODI went ahead on schedule after the pitch had been inspected by match referee Chris Broad.\n\nThe India Today footage of Salgaoncar speaking with a reporter, who was posing as a bookmaker, was broadcast a few hours before the match.\n\nThe MPIC project included:\n\n\n"}

Symptoms, which include itchy, raised papules, commonly occur within 1–2 days of infection and do not generally last more than 2–3 weeks. However, people repeatedly exposed to cercariae develop heavier symptoms with faster onset. Cercarial dermatitis is common in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats worldwide. Incidence may be on the rise, although this may also be attributed to better monitoring. Nevertheless, the condition has been regarded as emerging infectious disease.\n\nThere are no permanent effects to people from this condition. Orally administered hydroxyzine, an antihistamine, is sometimes prescribed to treat swimmer's itch and similar dermal allergic reactions. In addition, bathing in oatmeal, baking soda, or Epsom salts can also provide relief of symptoms.\n\nSwimmer’s itch probably has been around as long as humans. The condition was known to exist as early as the 1800s, but it was not until 1928 that a biologist found that the dermatitis was caused by the larval stage of a group of flatworm parasites in the family Schistosomatidae. The genera most commonly associated with swimmer’s itch in humans are \"Trichobilharzia\" and \"Gigantobilharzia\". It can also be caused by schistosome parasites of non-avian vertebrates, such as \"Schistosomatium douthitti\", which infects snails and rodents. Other taxa reported to cause the reaction include \"Bilharziella polonica\" and \"Schistosoma bovis\". In marine habitats, especially along the coasts, swimmer’s itch can occur as well.\n\nThese parasites use both freshwater snails and vertebrates as hosts in their parasitic life cycles as follows:\n\nHumans usually become infected after swimming in lakes or other bodies of slow-moving fresh water. Some laboratory evidence indicates snails shed cercariae most intensely in the morning and on sunny days, and exposure to water in these conditions may therefore increase risk. Duration of swimming is positively correlated with increased risk of infection in Europe and North America, and shallow inshore waters may harbour higher densities of cercariae than open waters offshore. Onshore winds are thought to cause cercariae to accumulate along shorelines. Studies of infested lakes and outbreaks in Europe and North America have found cases where infection risk appears to be evenly distributed around the margins of water bodies as well as instances where risk increases in endemic swimmer's itch \"hotspots\". Children may become infected more frequently and more intensely than adults but this probably reflects their tendency to swim for longer periods inshore, where cercariae also concentrate. Stimuli for cercarial penetration into host skin include unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic and linolenic acids. These substances occur naturally in human skin and are found in sun lotions and creams based on plant oils.\n\nVarious strategies targeting the mollusc and avian hosts of schistosomes, have been used by lakeside residents in recreational areas of North America to deal with outbreaks of swimmer's itch. In Michigan, for decades, authorities used copper sulfate as a molluscicide to reduce snail host populations and thereby the incidence of swimmer's itch. The results with this agent have been inconclusive, possibly because:\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, copper sulfate is toxic to more than just molluscs, and the effects of its use on aquatic ecosystems are not well understood.\n\nAnother method targeting the snail host, mechanical disturbance of snail habitat, has been also tried in some areas of North America and Lake Annecy in France, with promising results. Some work in Michigan suggests that administering praziquantel to hatchling waterfowl can reduce local swimmer's itch rates in humans. Work on schistosomiasis showed that water-resistant topical applications of the common insect repellent DEET prevented schistosomes from penetrating the skin of mice. Public education of risk factors, a good alternative to the aforementioned interventionist strategies, can also reduce human exposure to cercariae.\n\n"}

{"id": "1919696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919696", "title": "Verizon Arena", "text": "Verizon Arena\n\nVerizon Arena (formerly known as the Alltel Arena) is an 18,000-seat multi-purpose arena in North Little Rock, Arkansas, directly across the Arkansas River from downtown Little Rock. The arena opened in October 1999. It is Little Rock's main entertainment venue.\n\nThe Arkansas–Little Rock Trojans played home games at the arena from the time when the arena opened until the team moved in 2005 to a new arena, the Jack Stephens Center, on the school's campus in Little Rock. The Arkansas RiverBlades, a defunct ice hockey team of the ECHL, the Arkansas RimRockers, a defunct minor league basketball team of the NBA Development League, and the Arkansas Diamonds, a defunct Indoor Football League team, also played at the arena. The arena is also used for other events, including concerts, rodeos, auto racing, professional wrestling, and trade shows and conventions.\n\nOn August 1, 1995, Pulaski County, Arkansas, voters approved a one-year, one-cent sales tax for the purpose of building a multi-purpose arena, expanding the Statehouse Convention Center in Little Rock, and making renovations to the Main Street bridge between Little Rock and North Little Rock. $20 million of the sales tax proceeds went toward the Convention Center expansion, with the remainder used to build the arena.\n\nThat money, combined with a $20 million contribution from the State of Arkansas, $17 million from private sources and $7 million from Little Rock-based Alltel Corporation paid for the construction of a arena, which cost nearly $80 million to build. When the doors opened in 1999, the facility was paid for and there was no public indebtedness.\n\nTwo sites in North Little Rock drew interest from county officials for the proposed arena. The first was a commercial site west of Interstate 30, which contained a strip mall, a Kroger and an abandoned K-Mart storefront. The second site was an plot at the foot of the Broadway Bridge.\n\nThe Pulaski County Multipurpose Civic Center Facilities Board selected the larger site for the arena in 1996 and paid $3.7 million for the land, some of which was acquired through eminent domain, a move protested in court by several landowners.\nThe second site later would be chosen for the new baseball stadium, Dickey-Stephens Park, constructed for the Arkansas Travelers. The Class AA minor-league baseball team moved from the then 73-year-old Ray Winder Field in Little Rock to a new $28 million home in North Little Rock at the start of the 2007 season.\n\nThe arena was the home of the 2003, 2006, and 2009 Southeastern Conference women's basketball tournament and the 2000 Sun Belt Conference men’s basketball tournament. The Arena holds the all-time attendance record for an SEC Women's Tournament when 43,642 people attended the event in 2003.\n\nThe arena hosted portions of the first and second rounds of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in March 2008 and the SEC Gymnastics Championships in 2007.\n\nThe arena is also used for other events: concerts (seating capacity is between 15,000 and 18,000 for end-stage concerts; the arena has an 80-by-40-foot portable stage); rodeos and auto racing (seating capacity is 14,000); and trade shows and conventions (there are of arena floor space plus of meeting space and of pre-function space). As a concert venue, its location prompted Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band to play one of its most rarely performed numbers, 1973's \"Mary Queen of Arkansas\", during a March 2000 show on their Reunion Tour.\n\nThe arena is owned by the Multi-Purpose Civic Center Facilities Board for Pulaski County. The arena was designed by the Civic Center Design Team (CCDT), Burt Taggart & Associates, Architects/Engineers, The Wilcox Group, Garver & Garver Engineering and Rosser International of Atlanta.\n\nThe arena held the 2004, 2007 and 2009 American Idols LIVE! Tour concerts on August 13, 2004, July 13, 2007 and July 25, 2009, respectively.\n\nBecause of the $28.1 billion sale of Alltel to Verizon Wireless, as of June 30, 2009, the Alltel Arena was renamed Verizon Arena.\n\nFleetwood Mac performed at Verizon Arena May 4, 2013 with surprise guests former President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton attending the show. Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood introduced the couple, who were seated in an arena suite, to the sold-out audience and dedicated the song \"Don't Stop\" to them, which was appropriately Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential election campaign song.\n\nIn 2019 the naming rights to the venue will be changed from Verizon to Arkansas based Simmons Bank. The deal was announced in November 9, 2018. \n\n"}

Wax combs typically have features such a jagged or toothed edge and a straight, relatively sharp edge. The jagged edge is used to create textured grooves for improving the traction of the wax and the straight edge is used for scraping off unwanted wax. In addition to the straight edge for wax removal, some wax combs even have an inwardly curved edge for the rails (such as Mr. Zog's Sex Wax “Sex Comb”). Additionally, wax combs can have features such as fin key, bottle opener or a snap for portability (attachment to interior pocket loop, lanyard or leash attachment lanyard).\n"}
