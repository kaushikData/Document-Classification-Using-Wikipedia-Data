Australia defeated Sri Lanka by 53 runs (under the Duckworth–Lewis method) to win their 4th World Cup and 3rd in succession.\n\nAustralia reached the final by defeating South Africa by 7 wickets, while Sri Lanka reached the final by defeating New Zealand by 81 runs in the semi-finals.\n\nThis was the first World Cup final to be a repeat – the sides previously met in the 1996 World Cup Final, which Sri Lanka won. Australia has won every World Cup match against Sri Lanka apart from that loss. The match was Sri Lanka's second World Cup final appearance and Australia's sixth, their fourth in a row.\nRicky Ponting won the toss and elected to bat. However, the start of play was delayed due to rain, and the match was reduced to 38 overs per side. Adam Gilchrist's score of 149 – the highest in a World Cup final – helped give Australia an imposing total of 281. Sri Lankan batsmen Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya added 116 for the second wicket, before falling with the score at 123 and 145 respectively. Despite the regular loss of wickets, Sri Lanka managed to maintain a run rate of over 6 an over. Further rain forced the reduction of Sri Lanka's innings to just 36 overs, with the target revised to 269. At the culmination of the 33rd over, with Sri Lanka still trailing the adjusted Duckworth-Lewis target by 37 runs, the umpires suspended the game due to bad light. While Australia's players began to celebrate their victory (since the minimum 20 overs had been reached), the umpires incorrectly announced that because the match was suspended due to light and not rain, the final three overs would have to be bowled the following day. With Sri Lanka needing 61 runs from 18 deliveries, Mahela Jayawardene agreed there was no need to return the following day, and instructed his team to resume batting, with Ricky Ponting agreeing to play only spinners. Umpires later apologized for their error, and that the match should have ended then with Australia winning by 37 runs. The last three overs were played in almost complete darkness, during which Sri Lanka added nine runs, giving Australia a 53-run victory via the DL method, as Sri Lanka had batted 2 overs fewer than Australia.\n\nAustralia won the tournament undefeated, a streak of 29 World Cup games without a loss.

{"id": "885732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=885732", "title": "All-Ireland Senior Football Championship", "text": "All-Ireland Senior Football Championship\n\nThe All-Ireland Senior Football Championship (SFC) (), the premier competition in Gaelic football, is an annual series of games played in Ireland and organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). The All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final is played on the third or fourth Sunday in September at Croke Park in Dublin, with the winning team receiving the Sam Maguire Cup.\n\nContested by the top inter-county football teams in Ireland, the tournament has taken place every year since 1887, except in 1888, when the competition was not played due to a tour of the United States by would-be competitors.\n\nThe first Championship to be held featured club teams who represented their respective counties after their county championship. The 21 a-side final was between Commercials of Limerick and Young Irelands of Louth. The final was played in Beech Hill, Clonskeagh (not Bird Avenue) on 29 April 1888 with Commercials winning by 1–4 to 0–3. Unlike later All-Ireland competitions, there were no provincial championships, and the result was an open draw.\n\nThe second Championship was unfinished owing to the American Invasion Tour. The 1888 provincial championships had been completed (Tipperary, Kilkenny and Monaghan winning them; no Connacht teams entered) but after the Invasion tour returned, the All-Ireland semi-final and final were not played. English team London reached the final four times in the early years of the competition (1900–1903).\n\nIn 1892, inter-county teams were introduced to the All-Ireland Championship. Congress granted permission for the winning club to use players from other clubs in the county, thus the inter-county teams came into being. The rules of hurling and football were also altered: goals were made equal to five points, and teams were reduced from 21 to 17 a-side.\n\nThe 1903 Championship brought Kerry's first All-Ireland title. They went on to become the most successful football team in the history of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.\n\nThe first half of the twentieth century brought the rise of several teams who won two or more All-Ireland titles in that period, such as Kildare, Mayo, Cavan, Wexford and Roscommon. In the 1990s, a significant sea change took place, as the All-Ireland was claimed by an Ulster team in four consecutive years (1991–1994). Since then Ulster has produced more All-Ireland winning teams than any other province.\n\nThe All-Ireland Qualifiers were introduced in 2001. Later that year, the 2001 final brought victory for Galway who became the first football team to win an All-Ireland by springing through \"the back door.\" In 2013, Hawk-Eye was introduced for Championship matches at Croke Park. It was first used to confirm that Offaly substitute Peter Cunningham's attempted point had gone wide 10 minutes into the second half of a game against Kildare. 2013 also brought the first Friday night game in the history of the Championship - a first round qualifier between Carlow and Laois.\n\n2018 saw the introduction of the All Ireland Super 8s.\n\nThe county is a geographical region in Ireland, and each of the thirty-two counties in Ireland organise their own gaelic games affairs through a County Board. The county teams play in their respective Provincial Championships (reflective of the four Irish provinces) in Connacht (which also includes teams from London and New York), Leinster, Munster, and Ulster. Kilkenny is currently unique among the 32 Irish county associations in not participating in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. The Provincial Championships operate through a knock-out cup competition format. They take place during the months of May and June. The winners of each of the four Provincial Championships earn a place in the All-Ireland Super 8s, a round robin group stage new to the 2018 Championship, which takes place in the months of July and August.\n\nEach provincial championship match is played as a single leg. If a match is drawn extra time is played. However, if both sides are still level at the end of extra time a replay takes place. In the case of a provincial final if matches end level a replay takes place without extra time.\n\nThe twenty-nine teams that fail to win their respective Provincial Championships receive a second opportunity to reach the All-Ireland Series via the All Ireland Qualifiers (also known as the 'back door'). The qualifiers series takes place in the months of June and July and operates as follows:\n\n\nSignificant changes to the format of the Championship were made at GAA's Annual Congress in February 2017. The most significant change is the creation of The All-Ireland Quarter-Final Group Stage (known as the Super 8s), which replaced the previous Quarter-Final stage of the Championship. Additionally the All-Ireland Final was moved to August and replays will only be held for drawn provincial finals and drawn All-Ireland Finals, with extra time to be played in all other Championship matches. The changes will be trialled for three years before being reviewed by the GAA in late 2020.\n\nFrom 2001-17, the Championship was played using the Quarter-finals format. Under this format Provincial matches would take place during the months of May, June and July. The winners of each of the four Provincial Championships would earn a place in the All-Ireland Quarter-Finals, which would take place in the month of August. Replays would be played for all drawn matches, not just drawn Provincial Finals and drawn All-Ireland Finals. Extra-time would only be used for Replays and Qualifier Matches. If the teams were still level after extra time, the qualifier match would go to a replay or in the case of replays, another replay would take place.\n\nThe qualifiers series would take place in the months of June and July with the winning four teams of Round 4 playing the four Provincial Champions in the All-Ireland Quarter Finals.\n\n\nFor the first All-Ireland championship in 1887, the competition was played on an open draw knockout basis. From 1888, the provincial system was introduced, whereby the counties in each of Ireland's four provinces would play each other on a knockout basis to find provincial champions. These four champions would meet in the All-Ireland semi-finals. The structure outlined above was adopted in 2001 to allow more games to be played, but still retain provincial championships and the knockout structure, resulting in every game continuing to be a meaningful fixture, with no dead-rubber league format matches being played out.\n\nTypically, over the four Sundays of September, All-Ireland Finals in men's football, ladies' football, hurling and camogie take place at Croke Park, the national stadium of the GAA. Two grades are played on each final day, the \"senior\" team and the \"minor\" team (consisting of younger players, under the age of 18, who have participated in that year's All-Ireland Minor Football Championship). Guests who attend these events include the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach and other important dignitaries. The football final is considered the pinnacle event of this period.\n\nThe final game of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship takes place on the third Sunday of September. The men's decider regularly attracts crowds of over 80,000. The winning team captain receives the Sam Maguire Cup. The current champions are Dublin.\n\nAlthough Wexford were the first county to win four consecutive All-Ireland Senior Football Finals (1915–18), historically Kerry have been the most successful football team in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. As of 2015, Kerry have won the competition on 37 occasions, winning in four consecutive years twice (1929–1932 and 1978–1981) and for three consecutive years twice as well (1939–1941 and 1984–1986). Dublin have joined the four in a row club winning the competition consecutively since 2014. No team has yet conquered the five in a row. Galway were the first team from the western province of Connacht to win an All-Ireland title, doing so in 1925. The 1933 final brought victory for Cavan, who became the first team from the northern province of Ulster to win an All-Ireland title.\n\nTwo teams have won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship as part of a double with that year's All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, namely Cork (1890 and 1990) and Tipperary (1895 and 1900). The championship has never been won by a team from outside Ireland, though London have played in five finals.\n\nDublin are the reigning champions, having defeated Tyrone in the 2018 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final.\n\n\n"}

Until 2014, it hosted ETSU's men's and women's basketball teams. It also serves as the indoor venue for tennis and track. At one time, the facility also hosted ETSU's football team, but the school discontinued its football program at the end of the 2003 season as a cost-cutting measure. The football team was reinstated in 2015, but did not return to the facility; the Buccaneers played the 2015 and 2016 seasons at Kermit Tipton Stadium, a local high school facility, before opening the new William B. Greene Jr. Stadium in 2017. It was the host of the 2006 and 2007 Atlantic Sun Conference men's basketball tournaments, and the NAIA Indoor Track and Field Championships from 2001 to 2011. The Mini-Dome has also hosted non-athletic events that could not be housed in an indoor setting on most American college campuses, such as national indoor championships for free flight model aircraft.\n\nIn December 2009, the Tennessee Board of Regents approved the renaming of Memorial Center to ETSU/Mountain States Health Alliance Athletic Center, adding the name of the hospital system headquartered in Johnson City to the official name of the Mini-Dome.\n\nOn October 16, 2010, the ETSU/MSHA Athletic Center hosted a National Basketball Association exhibition game between the New Orleans Hornets and Atlanta Hawks.\n\nDominating the campus skyline, the building was opened in 1977 largely as an attempt to increase attendance at the university's struggling football program and to help its recruiting, but also as a large, multi-purpose campus building. The contract ran both well over budget and the allotted time, with the eventual opening occurring two football seasons later than had been planned.\n\nThe building has had its successes but never truly put the Buccaneer football program on the map, despite being one of very few on-campus domed stadiums in the United States. The decision was made by ETSU president Dr. Paul Stanton for ETSU to drop football following the conclusion of the 2003 season.\n\nFor the 2006–2007 academic year and basketball season, the Mini-Dome's occupancy was decreased to around 6,800 due to fire code restrictions. Efforts are underway to build a true basketball arena on campus, but the Mini-Dome will likely remain intact due to the large number of offices and training facilities it contains, as well as the enormous cost of demolition.\n\nIn 2006–2007, ETSU made an attempt to bring back the football program, but it failed when the student body voted down an increase in the athletic fee that was needed to fund it. The Mini-Dome was not considered as a possible venue for the new program. \n\nThe interior of the Mini-Dome is pictured briefly in the ending moments of the film \"We Are Marshall\" during a sequence of highlights of the Marshall University football team.\n\n"}
{"id": "33577240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33577240", "title": "Eight-ender", "text": "Eight-ender\n\nAn eight-ender, also called a snowman, is a perfect score within a single end of curling. In an end, both sides throw eight rocks, and in an eight-ender, all eight rocks from one team score points.\n\nEight-enders are extremely rare in competitive curling and are analogous to a perfect game in baseball or a perfect game in bowling (300). Eight-enders are so rare that the Canadian Curling Association has an eight-ender award to recognize any eight-ender scored in Canada. In 2007 Asham Curling Supplies awarded an $8000 prize randomly to one of the 145 teams that registered an eight-ender in the 2005–06 curling season.\n\nThe eight-ender in team curling is analogous to the six-ender in mixed doubles curling, as there is a total of six rocks in play per team instead of eight.\n\nThere has never been an eight-ender in Olympic competition, the closest being a 'seven-ender' scored by Scotland's Eve Muirhead at the 2014 Winter Olympics, in a 10-3 round-robin stage victory over the USA. In mixed doubles curling, the maximum score of six has been achieved at the Olympics, with Switzerland's Jenny Perret and Martin Rios doing so against the United States in the last end of their 9-4 round-robin win at the 2018 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn 1993, the team of Kim Gellard, Corie Beveridge, Lisa Savage, and Sandy Graham recorded two consecutive eight-enders. \n\nPerhaps the most famous eight-ender occurred at the 2006 Players' Championships in Calgary, Alberta on April 15, 2006. The tournament was the final Grand Slam event in the 2005-06 Grand Slam of Curling and had a CAD$100,000 purse – one of the largest in women's curling.\n\nThe match between Kelly Scott, who at the time was the reigning Canadian women's champion and went on to become a world champion, and Cathy King a former world bronze medalist. In the 6th end of their match, King and her rink played rather poorly, while Scott and her rink capitalized on King's mistakes. King ricocheted her final stone out the side of a crowded house, leaving Scott a draw for 8. Although her shot was heavy, Scott's rock came to a stop eighteen inches from the back of the house, enough to score her eighth point.\n\nAnother notable eight-ender occurred on January 22, 2011 at the MCA Bonspiel, the world's largest bonspiel. In this match Leskiw \"stole\" his eight points. In curling, when the team that does not have last rock in the end scores, the points scored are termed as stolen points. In this game, Leskiw managed an eight-ender even though Hamblin had the last rock, which gave him the opportunity to score or prevent Leskiw from scoring eight. In fact, Hamblin knocked Leskiw's eighth rock into the house with his final shot, turning a seven-point end into an eight-ender.\n\n2014 Olympic champion Brad Jacobs scored an eight-ender in the sixth end of the semi final of The Dominion 2012 Northern Ontario Men's Curling Championship against Tim Phillips in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Jacobs had been leading 6-3 at the time, and had the hammer. After allowing the eight points, the Phillips rink conceded the game. On his last rock, Phillips ricocheted off two Jacobs stones, and out the rings, exposing one of his rocks that had been buried. Jacobs still had to make a delicate hit to ensure the Philips stone was removed, and he had to stick it to score his eight, which he did.\n\nWinnipeg's Kerri Einarson scored an eight-ender in the seventh end of her first round robin game at the 2015 Manitoba Scotties Tournament of Hearts against Tiffany McLean of Brandon in Winkler on January 21, 2015. Einarson's rink stole the eight points, after having scored five points the previous end. Einarson won the game by a total score of 16-3. The feat was the first time an eight-ender had been scored at the Manitoba Scotties in recorded history.\n\nThe Australian men's team (skipped by Ian Palangio) scored an eight-ender in the first end of their match against Hong Kong (John Li) at the 2015 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships. The Aussies went on to win the match 16-3, after Hong Kong conceded after seven ends. It was the first international event for Hong Kong.\n\nThe Prince Edward Island women's team (skipped by Lisa Jackson) scored an eight-ender in the first end of their match against Nunavut (Angela Dale) at the 2015 Travelers Curling Club Championship, Canada's national curling club championship. P.E.I. went on to win the match 21-0, with Nunavut conceding after 6 ends (games at the Travelers are 8 ends in length). This was the first eight-ender ever scored at a national championship in Canada.\n\nThe South Korean's women's national team skipped by Kim Eun-jung scored an eight-ender in the first end of their match against Qatar (skipped by Mubarkah Al-Abdulla) at the 2016 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships. The Koreans went on to win the match 30-0 with Qatar conceding after six ends. It was the first international event for Qatar.\n\nThe United States women's national team skipped by Nina Roth scored an eight-ender in the sixth end of their first match against Brazil (skipped by Aline Gonçalves) at the 2017 Americas Challenge. The Americans went on to win the game 16-2 with the Brazilians immediately conceding after the 6th end. It was the first international event for the Brazilian women's team.\n\nTyler Tardi and his team from Langley scored an eight-ender in the second end of their game against Team Stephen Schneider of Vancouver in their final round robin game at the 2018 King Cash Spiel, an event on the World Curling Tour. Even though it was just the second end, Team Schneider conceded, losing the game 10-0. Tardi went on to win the event.\n"}

The stadium also hosted the 2016 ONEFA Championship owing to a schedule conflict with the Tigres UANL football club that prevented the use of the Estadio Universitario.\n\nGames between the various preparatory schools operated by the university are also held at the Estadio Gaspar Mass.

It is principally a girls' sport in schools, but is played by both men and women in adult leagues across the country. In the late 1990s, registered membership was just over 10,000 (8,200 women and 1,200 men) and the estimated total playing population, including school players, was 30,000.\n\nThe modern form of field hockey was first played in Canada in British Columbia. In 1896, the first recorded match in Canada was played by Vancouver girls, and the Vancouver Ladies Club was formed. Men were also playing at the turn of the century in Vancouver and Victoria, and a Vancouver League came into existence in 1902. The first women's organization in Canada was formed in Vancouver in 1927.\n\nAfter World War II, the immigration of players to Canada from all parts of the Commonwealth of Nations influenced the establishment of field hockey across the country, and by 1959 the game was being played in the Maritimes, Ontario and Alberta. The Canadian (men's) Field Hockey Association was founded in 1961; the Canadian Women's FHA a year later. In 1992 the CFHA and the CWFHA merged to form Field Hockey Canada.\n\nInternational contests have increased markedly since the 1950s. The Canadian women's team participated in the women's international tournament for the first time in 1956. In 1979 Canada hosted 18 countries in Vancouver for that world event; Canada placed 8th.

By physical force, overcoming the stretching pain and an appropriate technique, the opponent can be defeated. Usually, the opponents hook the middle fingers in a leather strap, in principle, however, every finger is allowed (except the thumb). Sometimes, also only the index fingers without strap are hooked into each other. Behind both hookers, two \"Auffänger\" (person who catches the opponent) are sitting. Additionally, there is a referee, a chairman and two assessors.\n\nAllegedly, disputes were settled in this way in former times in countries of the Alps. Therefore, it becomes part in the tradition of European forms of sports before a wide standardization took place by gymnastics and sport. In fact, Fingerhakeln is an organized sport in its present form. Leather straps (about 10 cm long and 6 to 8 mm strong), table (79 cm high, 74 cm wide and 109 cm long), stool (40 by 40 cm, 48 cm high) and distance between the middle line and the sideways lines (32 cm) are standardized. Every year, Bavarian, Austrian, German and Alpine championships in different weight and age classes are held.\n\nThe proverb \"Jemanden über den Tisch ziehen\" - with the meaning “to defeat, play off against someone” - has its origin in this popular sport in which not the force alone but especially the technique can decide.\n\n\n"}

The company includes parts of several previously independent companies, including Head Ski Company, founded in Delaware, United States, in 1950; Tyrolia, an Austrian ski-equipment manufacturer; and Mares, an Italian manufacturer of diving equipment. Head Ski Company produced one of the first successful metal-wood composite downhill ski, the Head Standard, and one of the first oversized metal tennis rackets. The company is headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\nHead N.V. was founded in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, in 1950 by aeronautical engineer Howard Head, after he took a ski trip and was astonished to see his skis were made of wood in an era when metals and plastics were replacing wood in many product designs. Head worked at the Glenn L. Martin Company where they used a form of aluminum and plastic laminate to build the fuselages of aircraft, and he felt the same material would make an ideal ski. After two years of constantly breaking skis, by the winter of 1950 they had a design that not only stayed together, but made turning dramatically easier.\n\nThe Head Standard would rapidly grow in sales through the 1950s, until it and other Head designs were capturing over 50% of the US market during the 1960s, making them the leading ski manufacturer in the U.S. and the UK. Head resisted the change to fibreglass construction. In 1967, Howard Head hired Harold Seigle as company president, and became the Chairman of the Board and CEO. Bored of the results, in 1969 Head sold the company to the AMF, and took up tennis. He later bought a controlling interest in Prince Sports.\n\nIn the late 1960s, a tennis division was created when Howard Head figured out a way of strengthening the tennis racket by introducing the aluminium frame. The idea became a success and was first introduced in the 1969 US Open. After Howard Head's departure, one of the tennis players that Head sponsored, Arthur Ashe, won Wimbledon, defeating favored Jimmy Connors in 1975. Also during the 1970s, Head acquired a diving manufacturer, Mares, and a ski binding company, Tyrolia. While under AMF ownership, Head manufactured tennis racquets in Boulder, Colorado, and Kennelbach, Austria. Also in 1969, Head signed Olympic champion ski racer Jean-Claude Killy to endorse a new metal and fiberglass ski, the Killy 800. Head subsequently developed an entire product line of Killy skis.\n\nIn 1985, Minneapolis-based Minstar Inc. acquired Head through hostile takeover of AMF. Two years later, Head started making athletic footwear, and introduced the \"Radial Tennis Shoes\". The following year, Head opened a new plant in Austria in order to produce more tennis rackets. In 1989, management bought out Head, Tyrolia, and Mares, to form HTM. The takeover was backed by private equity firm Freeman Spogli & Co. In 1993, HTM was sold to tobacco conglomerate Austria Tabak. Johan Eliasch, the current chairman, took over the company in 1995, which in 2014 was a Netherlands Antilles corporation.\n\nIn 1997, Head created the first titanium and graphite tennis racket. Over the next two years, Head acquired three more companies, DACOR, BLAX, and Penn Racquet Sports. Penn tennis balls are used in many high-profile tournaments worldwide, while Penn racquetballs are the official balls of the IRT and U.S. Racquetball Association. Penn once produced tennis balls and racquetballs in Phoenix, Arizona. In March 2009, Head shut down the Penn ball manufacturing factory. Now all tennis balls are produced in China.\n\nHead also licenses its brand to makers of clothing apparel (including shoes), accessories, bicycles, skates, watches, balls and fitness Equipment.\n\nHead proved to be successful in 2012, with three Major winners during the year: Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open, Maria Sharapova at the French Open and Andy Murray at the US Open.\n\nMen:\n\nWomen:\n\nMen:\n\nWomen:\n\n\n\n\nWomen:\n\nMen:\n\n\nWomen:\n\nMen\nWomen:\nFormer Players:\n\n\n"}

The name derives from the Greek \"hepta\" (seven) and ἄθλος (áthlos, or ἄθλον, áthlon, meaning \"feat\"). A competitor in a heptathlon is referred to as a heptathlete.\n\nThere are two heptathlons – the women's heptathlon and the men's – composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984.\n\nWomen's heptathlon is the combined event for women contested in the athletics programme of the Olympics and at the IAAF World Championships. The IAAF Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women's heptathlon champion. The women's outdoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and the remaining three on day two:\n\n\nThe heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s, when it replaced the pentathlon as the primary women's combined event contest (the javelin throw and 800 m were added). It was first contested at the Olympic level in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In recent years some women's decathlon competitions have been conducted, consisting of the same events as the men's competition in a slightly different order, and the IAAF has begun keeping records for it, but the heptathlon remains the championship-level combined event for women. Nafissatou Thiam, representing Belgium, is the 2016 Olympic Gold Medallist and the 2017 World Champion.\n\nThere is also a Tetradecathlon, which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day.\n\nThe heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The formulae are constructed so that, for each event, a designated \"standard\" performance (for example, approximately 1.82 m for the high jump) scores 1000 points. Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75 m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The formulae are devised so that successive constant increments in performance correspond to gradually increasing increments in points awarded.\nThe events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae:\n\nP is for points, T is for time in seconds, M is for height or length in centimeters and D is length in meters. a, b and c have different values for each of the events (see table).\n\nThe following table shows the benchmark levels needed to earn 1000, 900, 800 and 700 points in each event.\n\nThe other version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. It is the men's combined event in the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. The men's indoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two:\n\n\nThe scoring is similar for both versions. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition.\n\nThe following table shows the minimum benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther multiple event contests include:\n\nSummer sports\n\nWinter sports\n\nOther\n\n"}

According to the Official Baseball Rules, such a streak is not necessarliy ended when a player has at least 1 plate appearance and no hits. A streak shall not be terminated if all official plate appearances result in a base on balls, hit by pitch, defensive interference or a sacrifice bunt. The streak shall terminate if the player has a sacrifice fly and no hit.\n\nJoe DiMaggio holds the Major League Baseball record with a streak of 56 consecutive games in 1941 which began on May 15 and ended July 17. DiMaggio hit .408 during his streak (91-for-223), with 15 home runs and 55 runs batted in.\n\nThere have been 55 occurrences in Major League Baseball where a player had a hitting streak of at least 30 games. Multiple streaks in the same season have occurred in 1922 (George Sisler and Rogers Hornsby), 1987 (Paul Molitor and Benito Santiago), 1997 (Nomar Garciaparra and Sandy Alomar, Jr.), 1999 (Vladimir Guerrero and Luis Gonzalez), 2006 (Chase Utley and Willy Taveras), and 2011 (Andre Ethier and Dan Uggla). In addition, 1924 included one whole streak (Sam Rice) and the beginning of another (George Sisler). A similar event occurred in 2006 with two whole streaks (Utley and Taveras) and the end of another (Jimmy Rollins).\n\nKeeler's streak started in his final game of the 1896 season, and continued through the first 44 games of the 1897 season. Rollins ended the 2005 season with a 36-game streak and extended it through the first two games of the 2006 season. Sisler had a hit in the last game of 1924 and the first 34 games of 1925. Major League Baseball recognizes two hitting streak records: Longest hitting streak in one season, and longest hitting streak over multiple seasons (e.g. Rollins 2005–2006). Keeler's, Sisler's, and Rollins' streaks are listed as 44, 34, and 36 games when discussing \"single-season\" streaks, and 45, 35, and 38 games when discussing \"multiple-season\" streaks.\n\nThis list omits Denny Lyons of the 1887 American Association Philadelphia Athletics, who had a 52-game hitting streak. In 1887, the major leagues adopted a new rule which counted walks as hits, a rule which was dropped after that season. Lyons hit in 52 consecutive games that season, but his streak included two games (#22 and #44) in which his only \"hits\" were walks. In 1968, MLB ruled that walks in 1887 would not be counted as hits, so Lyons' streak was no longer recognized, though it still appears on some lists. In 2000 Major League Baseball reversed its 1968 decision, ruling that the statistics which were recognized in each year's official records should stand, even in cases where they were later proven incorrect. Paradoxically, the ruling affects only hit \"totals\" for the year; the batting champion for the year is not recognized as the all-time leader despite having the highest single-season average under the ruling, and Lyons' hitting streak is not recognized.\n\nTy Cobb, Sam Rice, and George Sisler are the only players with multiple streaks of 30 games or longer.\n\nThere have been 129 single-season streaks of 25 games or more. The lowest batting average ever recorded during a hitting streak of 25 games or more was .304 by Bruce Campbell in 1938. The highest was .486 during Chuck Klein's streak in 1930. Joe DiMaggio hit .408 during his record-holding 56 game streak. In probability theory, every baseball game is a Bernoulli trial in which a hitter either does or does not get a hit. DiMaggio's streak of 56 consecutive games with hits awaits an equal streak: \"The probability is .0003 that a .350 hitter will have a hitting streak of at least 56 games in a season. If there are about 4 such seasons per year in the future, we would expect to see such a streak, assuming the Bernoulli trials model, every 1/(.0003 x 4) = 833 years.\"\n\nOnly currently extant franchises are included on this list. Where a player had a significant streak while the team was in other than its current city, the records in these other cities are displayed. As above, for a multi-year streak, the single-season streak is shown in parentheses.\n\nThe longest streaks in the history of Minor League Baseball and other professional baseball leagues:\n\nDiMaggio set the Minor League record as a member of the San Francisco Seals. Unrecognized by Minor League Baseball is the 69 game hitting streak by Joe Wilhoit in 1919. Wilhoit was in the independent Western League at the time and his record is considered the all-time Professional Baseball record.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3094179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3094179", "title": "Ice yachting", "text": "Ice yachting\n\nIce yachting is the sport of sailing and racing iceboats, also called ice yachts.\n\nIce yachting is practiced in Austria, Germany, Great Britain, Poland, Norway and Sweden, to some extent, and is very popular in the Netherlands and on the Gulf of Finland, but its highest development is in the United States and Canada. The Dutch ice yacht is a flat-bottomed boat resting crosswise upon a planking about three feet wide and sixteen long, to which are affixed four steel runners, one each at bow, stern and each end of the planking. The rudder is a fifth runner fixed to a tiller. Heavy mainsails and jibs are generally used and the boat is built more for safety than for speed. The iceboat of the Gulf of Finland is a V-shaped frame with a heavy plank running from bow to stern, in which the mast is stepped. The stern or steering runner is worked by a tiller or wheel. The sail is a large lug and the boom and gaff are attached to the mast by travelers. The passengers sit upon planks or rope netting. The Russian boats were faster than the Dutch-built ice yachts.\n\nIce Yachting was born in Europe, but by 1790 the sport was in vogue on the Hudson River, its headquarters being in Poughkeepsie, New York. The boat was a square box on three runners, the two forward runners being nailed to the box and the third acting as a rudder operated by a tiller. This type of boat was first built in 1790 by Oliver Booth of Poughkeepsie. At this time, during the early days of the sport, it was an activity for the masses and not only for the wealthy. \n\nThe above primitive style was in general use until 1853, when triangular frames with boxes for the crew aft and jib and mainsail rig were introduced. Also at this time, the 1850s, ice yacht clubs were formed in Newburgh, New Hamburg, Poughkeepsie, and Hyde Park. Members of the various clubs competed to win races such as the Ice yacht Challnge Pennant of America and the Captain William Drake Flag. They also raced against the newly introduced trains that began running along the Hudson River. \n\nA heavy, hard-riding type soon developed, with short gaffs, low sails, large jibs and booms extending far over the stern. It was over-canvassed and the mast was stepped directly over the runner plank, bringing the centre of sail-balance so far aft that the boats were apt to run away, and the over-canvassing frequently caused the windward runner to swing up into the air to a dangerous height. The largest and fastest example of this type, which prevailed until 1879, was Commodore John. E. Roosevelt's first \"Icicle\", which measured overall and carried of canvas. The \"Icicle\" once beat the Chicago Express on its run from Poughkeepsie to Ossining. \n\nJ.E. Roosevelt founded the Hudson River Ice Yacht Club in 1869. A 46-foot version of the \"Icicle\" recorded a speed of over 100 miles per hour. \n\nIn 1879, H. Relyea built the \"Robert Scott\", which had a single backbone and guy wires, and it became the model for all Hudson River ice yachts. Masts were now stepped farther forward, jibs were shortened, booms were cut down, and the center of sail-balance was brought more inboard and higher up, causing the centers of effort and resistance to come more in harmony. The shallow steering-box became elliptical. \n\nThe first race for the American Challenge Pennant occurred in 1881, which represents the championship of the Hudson River. The clubs that competed included the Hudson River, North Shrewsbury, Orange Lake, Newburgh and Carthage Ice Yacht Clubs. The races are usually sailed five times round a triangle of which each leg measures one mile, at least two of the legs being to windward. \n\nIn 1911 modern ice yachts were made of a single-piece backbone the entire length of the boat, and a runner-plank upon which it rests at right angles, the two forming a kite-shaped frame. The best woods for these pieces are basswood, butternut, and pine. They are cut from the log in such a way that the heart of the timber expands, giving the planks a permanent curve, which, in the finished boat, is turned upward. The two forward runners, usually made of soft cast iron and about . long and high, are set into oak frames a little over 5 feet long and 5 inches high. The runners have a cutting edge of 90%, though a V-shaped edge is often preferred for racing. The rudder is a runner about . long, worked by a tiller, sometimes made very long, 7½ feet not being uncommon. This enables the helmsman to lie in the box at full length and steer with his feet, leaving his hands free to tend the sheet. Masts and spars are generally made hollow for racing-yachts and the rigging is pliable steel wire. The sails are of 10-ounce duck for a boat carrying of canvas. They have very high peaks, short hoists and long booms. The mainsail and jib rig is general, but a double-masted lateen rig has been found advantageous. The foremost ice-yacht builder of America was G. E. Buckhout of Poughkeepsie.\n\nAn ice yacht is about in length and can carry six or seven passengers or crew, who are distributed in such a manner as to preserve the balance of the boat. In a good breeze the crew lie out on the windward side of the runner-plank to balance the boat, and reduce the pressure on the leeward runner. A course of with many turns has been sailed on the Hudson in less than 48 minutes, the record for a measured mile with flying start being at the rate of about an hour. In a high wind, however, ice yachts often move at the rate of 85 and even an hour.\n\nOn the bays near New York, a peculiar kind of iceboat has developed, called scooter, which may be described as a toboggan with a sail. A typical scooter is about long with an extreme beam of , perfectly oval in form and flat. It has mainsail and jib carried on a mast 9 or 10 feet long and set well aft, and is provided with two long parallel metal runners. There is no rudder, the scooter being steered entirely by trimming the sails, particularly the jib. As the craft is flat and buoyant, it sails well in water, and can thus be used on very thin ice without danger. A speed of has been attained by a scooter.\n\nIn the early 20th century ice yachts were divided into four classes, carrying respectively of canvas or more, between 450 and 600, between 300 and 450, and less than . In the 1930s the Detroit News held a competition to design an inexpensive iceboat for ordinary (not wealthy) citizens. A new type of boat, known at the DN, resulted. The prevalent yachts used today are known as \"stern-steerers\" because of the skate in the back which is used to steer them. They have a long central beam, often hollow, clamped to large runner planks close to the mast that carry the forward skates. The sailors ride in an oval pod at the stern, which often has elegant varnished rails and turned stiles. One sailor steers and the other works the sheets, or control lines for the sails. \n\nIce yachting is very popular on the Great Lakes, both in the United States and Canada, the Kingston, Ontario Club having a fleet of over 25 sail. Other important centers of the sport are the Lake Geneva, Wisconsin area, with an average of twenty-five sailing days a season for the last five years, Lakes Minnetonka and White Bear in Minnesota, Lakes Winnebago and Pepin in Wisconsin, Bar Harbor Lake in Maine, the St. Lawrence River, Quinte Bay and Lake Champlain.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his poem \"Cricket: An Heroic Poem\" (1744).\nSon of George Dance the Elder, who worked as an architect and city surveyor, Love was himself a cricketer, being a member of Richmond Cricket Club. Richmond was a leading club in the 1740s and Love may have represented Surrey too. However, no details have survived of his playing career.\n\nHe was also likely the founder of the Theatre Royal in Richmond upon Thames, which he managed from 1766 to 1773. In 1763, at Drury Lane in London, he played the role of Falstaff, for which he became best known as an actor, his authorial pseudonym serving also as his stage name. In 1766 he played his signature role in a new play, William Kenrick's \"Falstaff's Wedding\", intended as a sequel to \"Henry IV, Part 2\". He performed, too, in both Dublin and Edinburgh, of which he was a sometime manager. Invited to Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in 1762, he retained a connection to it for the rest of his life.\n\nAs a writer, Love met success with such Rome-inspired Pantomimes as \"The Witches; or, Harlequin Cherokee\" (1762), \"The Rites of Hecate; or, Harlequin from the Moon\" (1763) and \"The Hermit; or, Harlequin at Rhodes\" (1766), in addition to \"Cricket\". His earliest work was \"Pamela\" (1742).\nHe is famous within sporting circles for his \"Cricket: An Heroic Poem\" (1744), whose line \"The strokes re-echo o'er the spacious ground\" has been quoted in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". Its subtitle reads thus: \"Illustrated with the Critical Observations of Scriblerus Maximus. To which is Added an Epilogue, call'd 'Bucks Have at Ye All'. Spoken by Mr. King, at the Theatre Royal in Dublin, in the Character of Ranger, in the Suspicious Husband.\"\n\nOn 4 July 1745, the \"Daily Advertiser\" advertised it at 1/-. A footnote to the publication adds that it was \"[p]rinted for W Bickerton at the Gazette in the Temple Exchange near the Inner Temple Gate, Fleet Street.\"\n\nLove was also the brother of George Dance the Younger, who took on the same occupation as his father. It is probable that both the Younger and the Elder helped to construct the Richmond Theatre. According to Dorothy Stroud, \"references to the building are vague and two of them, while agreeing as to sponsors, differ as to the name of the designer. A third gives it to [David] Garrick and it is evident that there was a good deal of confusion as to the various participants.\"\n\n\n"}

It currently serves as the home of the BYU Cougars men's ice hockey team, Peaks Youth Hockey Association, several high school teams, the Peaks Figure Skating Club, as well as a Learn-to-Skate USA program for beginning skaters of all ages.\n\nProvo was chosen as the site for an Olympic venue because the leaders of Utah County refused to support Utah's 1989 Olympic referendum unless they were promised at least one Olympic event would be held in the county. Originally county leaders wanted a speed skating oval built somewhere in Provo or on the campus of Utah Valley University; others suggested the game's Closing Ceremony could be held at Brigham Young University's football stadium. After the 1989 Olympic referendum passed, and Salt Lake City lost its 1991 bid to host the 1998 Winter Olympics, the Utah Sports Authority and Provo City decided to wait until Salt Lake City bid again for the 2002 Winter Olympics before any venue planning would start.\n\nAfter Salt Lake City won the 2002 Olympic bid in 1995, planning began again for what venue Utah County could host. It was decided that the city of Provo would host the venue, but that it would only be a practice ice sheet, mostly like to be built in the planned Provo Towne Centre mall. Eventually plans changed and a larger, yet still only a practice ice facility, was planned to be constructed near Provo's East Bay Golf Course. Utah County, Provo, and SLOC all okayed the plans and committed to building the $7.7 million (equivalent to $ million in ) facility. But in July 1996, before construction had started, the owners of Provo's Seven Peaks Waterpark approached the city and asked that the arena be built on the park's property, and Seven Peaks would pay for an additional ice sheet to be constructed in the same building. The plan was approved by county officials October 14, 1996, with Provo paying $2 million, Utah County $2 million, SLOC $3 million, and Seven Peaks donating land for the arena and parking spaces. Valentiner, Crane, Brunjes, Onyon Architecture was chosen to design the arena.\nOn September 17, 1997 ground was broken for construction next to Seven Peaks Waterpark. It was to be in size, with two ice sheets side by side. One ice sheet would have seating for about 2,000 spectators while the other would seat 300. By the time ground was broken the price had increased to $8.5 million, $1.5 million more than originally planned; the extra cost would be paid for by Seven Peaks.\n\nSoon after construction had begun SLOC decided to host competitive hockey events in the new arena, versus the original plan to use the arena for practices, and using Utah Valley University's UCCU Center (then known as the McKay Events Center) for the competitions. SLOC would contribute $5.25 million (equivalent to $ million in ) towards the project, the cost of which had just jumped to $10.75 million, with the addition of 12 locker rooms instead of four, extra seating, and other minor additions to the original plan.\n\nThe arena opened November 20, 1998 in what was considered a \"soft opening\", and following the completion of minor work, the arena was supposed to have a grand opening in January or February 1999. But in December 1998 allegations of a scandal involving SLOC members, and members of the International Olympic Committee concerning the 2002 Olympic bid surfaced, pushing back the grand opening. As a result, the grand opening celebration was held September 29, 1999, and the venue hosted its first event, a hockey game between the University of Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs and the University of Calgary Oval Extremes, two days later. The completed arena cost $12.4 million to build, included two ice sheets, had seating for over 2,000 spectators, and was in size.\n\nOn November 20, 2008 Provo City took control of the arena from Seven Peaks owner Max Rabner, resolving a lawsuit that had been on going for years over the original construction and management agreements. The arena is now operated by the Parks and Recreation Department of Provo.\n\nDuring the 2002 games both men's and women's ice hockey games and practices were held in the arena. Because of its original size over 6,000 temporary seats had to be installed to boost the ice center's capacity to 8,400, including press members. 93 percent of tickets were sold, for a total 131,067 of spectators witnessing events in the arena.\n\nThe arena is home to the Peaks Figure Skating Club. The arena also serves as home ice for the ACHA collegiate hockey team of Brigham Young University, and high school teams including Timpanogos, Utah County Independent, Lehi, Payson, Spanish Fork and Springville, as well as the Peaks Youth Hockey Association. The arena is open to the public for ice skating, skating lessons, and can even be used for indoor soccer games.\n\n"}
{"id": "17680945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17680945", "title": "Pelé runaround move", "text": "Pelé runaround move\n\nThe Pelé runaround move is a football move designed to get around an opponent. The move requires split-second timing and speed in execution - letting a pass from a teammate approach but allowing it run past the opponent, then sprinting around the opposing player to continue the attack. It relies on speed for its execution in situations where there is little time or space. The \"Pelé variant\" was demonstrated by Brazilian Pelé during the 1970 FIFA World Cup match against Uruguay. In the second half, Brazilian centre-forward Tostão played a through pass to Pelé as a counter-attack started. Sprinting up the middle, Pelé was immediately confronted with the Uruguayan goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz who came off his line quickly. Pelé got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the goalkeeper's left, while Pelé went to the goalkeepers right. Circling the goalkeeper to collect, Pelé shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.\n\nPelé's move is a variant of the \"selling the dummy\" feint - letting the ball go \"around\" a defender then also circling the opponent, rather than following the straight path of a pass or loose ball, and can be useful in tight situations. It is discussed in such books as Scientific Soccer of the Seventies by soccer historian Kenneth MacDonald, who also discusses Pelé's contribution in Brazil's 1970 World Cup victory in detail. This \"runaround\" move is mentioned in official FIFA World Cup Technical Reports as \"audaciously executed, and called for immense skill, timing, judgment and speed.\"\n\nSwedish player Jesper Blomqvist managed to perform a variant of the Pele runaround move with more success, adding a fake, that resulted in a goal when his IFK Göteborg played Helsingborgs IF in the Allsvenskan in 1995. Blomqvist relied more on deception than Pelé. Whereas the Brazilian had to move with utmost speed to avoid Mazurkiewicz, Blomqvist had more time and used a deceptive shuffling of the feet. Receiving an excellent through pass, the Swede confused the approaching keeper - letting the ball run - and \"faking left\", while sprinting right, around his opponent. He collected the ball on the other side and finished with an easy goal. As demonstrated by both Blomqvist and Pelé, the runaround move can thus work in \"emergency\" situations where speed and split-second timing is all, or where there is more time and space to fake out an opponent. In both scenarios, it can lead to spectacular results.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "169906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169906", "title": "Sociology of sport", "text": "Sociology of sport\n\nSociology of sport, alternately referred to as sports sociology, is a sub-discipline of sociology which focuses on sports as social phenomena. It is an area of study concerned with various socio-cultural structures, patterns, and organizations or groups involved with sport.\n\nThere are many perspectives through which sport can be viewed. Therefore, very often some binary divisions are stressed, such as: professional vs. amateur, mass vs. top-level, active vs. passive/spectator, men vs. women, sports vs. play (as an antithesis to organized and institutionalized activity). Following feminist or other reflexive and tradition-breaking paradigms sports are sometimes studied as contested activities, i.e. as activities in the centre of various people/groups interests (connection of sports and gender, mass media, or state-politics).\n\nIn most premodern societies, the gender role for females and males in sports was reinforced at a young age. The sociology that formed surrounding sports enforced the idea that sports were too masculine for women and are encouraged to play noncompetitive games while men were able to compete. The impact of sports and games was to prepare young children for adulthood. The separation between the roles of men and women in a society of sports is expressed through media and gender identity. On media, the sports viewership varies by gender. Men's sports are more prominent in the media versus women's sports and the sports broadcast vary. On NCAA news, the text and text space greater than 2:1 coverage of men’s sports over women’s, the pictures are around 2:1 male athletes over female athletes. For males the sports typically include football, hockey, baseball, soccer, basketball, pro wrestling and boxing, while women's sports covers figure skating, gymnastics, skiing, and diving. There is a contrast in the sports for each gender: the men's sports include confrontative, combative coordination and the women's sports are less aggressive and more individual and stylish. Participation in “masculine” sports creates gender identity conflict for females, likewise participation in “feminine” sports creates gender identity conflict for males.\n\nThe emergence of the sociology of sport (though not the name itself) dates from the end of the 19th century, when first social psychological experiments dealing with group effects of competition and pace-making took place. Besides cultural anthropology and its interest in games in the human culture, one of the first efforts to think about sports in a more general way was Johan Huizinga's \"Homo Ludens\" or Thorstein Veblen's \"Theory of the Leisure Class\". In 1970, sports sociology gained significant attention as an organized, legitimate field of study. The North American Society for the Sociology of Sport was formed in 1978 with the objective of studying the field. Its research outlet, the \"Sociology of Sport Journal\", was formed in 1984.\n\nToday, most sports sociologists identify with at least one of four essential theories that define the relationship between sports and society, namely structural functionalism, conflict theory, critical theory, and symbolic interactionism.\n\nJean-Marie Brohm in \"Sport: A Prison of Measured Time\" presents a Marxist critique of organized sport as an instrument of indoctrination and subordination.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although chess had been a game of the bourgeois and upper classes before the revolution, its popularity among Bolshevik leaders, including Lenin, contributed to its being supported by state leaders in the USSR as a national pastime. References to a Soviet School of Chess only occurred after World War II, when a generation of Soviet chess players, led by soon-to-be world champion Mikhail Botvinnik, began a string of victories over international competitors that surprised the world.\n\nGenerally speaking, chess experts in the USSR described the Soviet School of Chess as a fast-paced, daring style of play best exemplified by the young generation of postwar players like David Bronstein. Not all Soviet players used this playing style, though. The most notable exception was Botvinnik, whom grandmaster Mark Taimanov compared to the methodical Wilhelm Steinitz. The main contribution of the Soviet School of Chess was not the style of players but their emphasis on rigorous training and study of the game, i.e. considering chess a sport rather than an art or science.\n\n\n"}

The popcorn can lid soon dented which led to the discovery that cake pans flew better and were more common. Morrison and Lu developed a little business selling \"Flyin' Cake Pans\" on the beaches of Santa Monica, California. \n\nDuring World War II he learned something of aerodynamics flying his P-47 Thunderbolt in Italy. He was shot down and was a prisoner of war for 48 days. \n\nIn 1946, he sketched out a design (called the Whirlo-Way) for the world's first flying disc. In 1948 an investor, Warren Franscioni, paid for molding the design in plastic. They named it the Flyin-Saucer. After disappointing sales, Fred & Warren parted ways in early 1950. In 1954, Fred bought more of the Saucers from the original molders to sell at local fairs, but soon found he could produce his own disc more cheaply. In 1955, he and Lu designed the Pluto Platter, the archetype of all modern flying discs. On January 23, 1957, they sold the rights for the Pluto Platter to the Wham-O toy company. Initially Wham-O continued to market the toy solely as the \"Pluto Platter\", but by June 1957 they also began using the name \"Frisbee\" after learning that college students in the Northeast were calling the Pluto Platter by that name.
