{"id": "535971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=535971", "title": "Bloodsport (film)", "text": "Bloodsport (film)\n\nBloodsport is a 1988 American martial arts film directed by Newt Arnold. It stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, Donald Gibb, Leah Ayres, and Bolo Yeung. The film is partly based on unverified claims made by martial artist Frank Dux. It sold well at the box office, grossing $65 million on a budget of $1.5–2.3 million. \"Bloodsport\" was one of Van Damme's first starring films and showcased his athletic abilities. It has since become a cult film.\n\nU.S. Army Captain Frank Dux has trained from his youth in the ways of ninjutsu under his sensei Senzo Tanaka. He wants to take the place of Tanaka's deceased son Shingo in the illegal martial arts tournament \"Kumite\" in Hong Kong, in order to honor his sensei. As a young boy, Dux and a group of his friends broke into Tanaka's home to steal a katana, but Dux was apprehended while returning the katana to its place. Impressed by Dux's honesty and lack of fear, Senzo trained him together with Shingo. After Shingo's death, Senzo agreed to train Dux as a member of the Tanaka clan. When Dux's superiors learn of his invitation to the Kumite, they refuse to let him go. Dux goes absent without leave before saying goodbye to his sensei and leaving for Hong Kong. Two Criminal Investigation Command (CID) officers, Helmer and Rawlins, are assigned to track down and arrest Dux for desertion.\n\nAfter arriving in Hong Kong, Dux befriends American fighter Ray Jackson and Victor Lin, who becomes the manager of Jackson and Dux. The two Americans and Chong Li—the ruthless Kumite champion—all make it through the first day of the Kumite. Dux earns the enmity of Li after breaking his record for the fastest knockout. He becomes involved with American journalist Janice Kent, who attempts to investigate the secrets of Kumite but is shocked by its violence. On the second day of the tournament, Jackson is matched against Li. Although Jackson gains the upper hand, he gloats instead of finishing Li off. Li recovers and brutally beats Jackson, landing him in hospital. Dux vows to avenge Jackson. Kent tries to convince Dux to pull out of the tournament for his own safety, but he refuses.\n\nOn the last day of the competition, Dux is cornered by Helmer and Rawlins, but he defeats them and the local police. He promises to give himself up once the tournament is over. Dux advances to the tournament final to face Li, who alienated the audience by killing his semi-final opponent. Dux overpowers Li, but Li cheats by blinding him with a crushed salt pill. Dux uses his other senses as Senzo had taught him to overcome the handicap and defeat Li, becoming the first Western winner of the Kumite. After visiting Jackson in the hospital, he returns to the United States with the CID officers.\n\n\nCo-writer Sheldon Lettich came up with the idea for the film.\n\nI had known Frank Dux for a number of months before I came up with the idea for \"Bloodsport\". Frank told me a lot of tall tales, most of which turned out to be bullshit. But his stories about participating in this so-called \"Kumite\" event sounded like a great idea for a movie. There was one guy who he introduced me to, named Richard Bender, who claimed to have actually been at the Kumite event and who swore everything Frank told me was true. A few years later this guy had a falling-out with Frank, and confessed to me that everything he told me about the Kumite was a lie; Frank had coached him in what to say.\n\nProducer Mark Di Salle said he was looking for \"a new martial arts star who was a ladies' man, [but Van Damme] appeals to both men and women. He's an American hero who fights for justice the American way and kicks the stuffing out of the bad guys.\" \"Bloodsport\" is one of the few films featuring scenes filmed inside Kowloon Walled City before its destruction.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" reports a U.S. box office gross of $11.7 million against a budget of $2.3 million. According to \"The Chicago Tribune\", the film pulled in $65 million worldwide, including $15 million in the U.S. and Canada, making it Cannon Group's most profitable film of 1988.\n\n\"Bloodsport\" was released on VHS, selling 150,000 units by 1989. Warner Brothers released a DVD of the film in the United States on October 1, 2002.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that the film received positive reviews from 33% of the 18 surveyed critics; the average rating was 4.3 out of 10. Leonard Klady of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"Hacking through the jungle of cliche and reservoir of bad acting in \"Bloodsport\" [...] are some pretty exciting matches.\"\n\nVan Damme was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star, but lost out to Ronald McDonald in \"Mac and Me\".\n\n\"Bloodsport\"s soundtrack score was composed by Paul Hertzog, who also composed another Jean-Claude Van Damme film titled \"Kickboxer\". The soundtrack contains the songs \"Fight to Survive\" and \"On My Own\", both performed by Stan Bush. Bush's songs are replaced on the soundtrack with alternate versions sung by Paul Delph, who was nominated for a Grammy for this work. The film plays the song \"Steal the Night\" by Michael Bishop during a scene where Dux runs from Helmer and Rawlins. The song was not released until the mid-2000s, as a single containing a vocal and instrumental version. On June 26, 2007, Perseverance Records released a limited edition CD of the soundtrack including, for the first time, the original film versions of the Stan Bush songs.\n\nSince its release, \"Bloodsport\" has become a cult film. It was followed by three sequels: \"\" (1996), \"Bloodsport III\" (1997) and \"\" (1999). They were released direct-to-video, and Jean-Claude Van Damme did not appear in any of them.\n\nA remake of \"Bloodsport\" was reported to be in planning in 2011. Phillip Noyce was attached to direct a screenplay by Robert Mark Kamen. The main character was supposed to be an American Afghanistan War veteran competing in a vale tudo tournament in Brazil. \"V for Vendetta\" director James McTeigue was attached to the project by 2013, and the filming was to be done in Australia and Brazil.\n\n\"Bloodsport\" was covered in the 132nd episode of the Earwolf Network movie criticism podcast \"How Did This Get Made?\", released on March 23, 2016.\n\n"}

It is one of 16 racecourses operated by the Arena Racing Company and is home of the richest race in Wales, the Coral Welsh Grand National.\n\nThe track is a roughly oval circuit of just under . It is a left-handed undulating course, used for both flat and jump racing. The finishing straight is about in length, with five fences on the chase course to be jumped. There are eleven fences on a complete circuit. There is also a straight mile course.\n\nThere are 32 fixtures in the 2017 calendar year including the new two-day Totepool Jumps Season Opener with £300,000 of prize money on Saturday 14th and Sunday 15 October. This meeting features the £50,000 Grade Three Tote Silver Trophy (Handicap Hurdle) and the £35,000 Grade Two Totepool Persian War Novices' Hurdle.\n\nThe £150,000 Coral Welsh Grand National takes place on Wednesday 27 December 2017. This meeting also features the Coral Future Champions Finale Juvenile Hurdle, one of only three Grade One juvenile hurdles in the calendar.\n\nChepstow is one of three racecourses in Wales, the others being at Bangor-on-Dee and at Ffos Las. It is also used as a venue for numerous other indoor and outdoor events, such as concerts, weddings and conferences.\n\nSeveral places in South Wales had race meetings in the late nineteenth century and there had been racing at St Arvans, very close to the present course, between 1892 and 1914. In 1925 a group of ten South Wales gentry and businessmen, that included Courtenay Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar who was also Lord-Lieutenant of Monmouthshire, and Lord Queenborough; formed a company to purchase Piercefield House, and lay out a new racecourse in its estate. Despite struggling to raise enough cash, the racecourse was opened on 6 August 1926. The first race was a two-year-old seller won by Lord Harewood's colt Conca D'Oro, the 7-4 favourite. The two day flat race meeting had good prize money and was termed \"The Welsh Goodwood\".\n\nThe course nearly had to close down immediately after the first meeting and survived only thanks to a large bank loan guaranteed by the directors. Unforeseen extra costs in laying it out meant that it struggled financially for the first ten years of its existence and yet more contributions were needed from the directors. The first jump racing took place in March 1927. Since then the course has been used for flat racing in the summer and jumping in the winter. To begin with, the flat racing was more prestigious, with the Welsh Derby, Oaks and St Leger being run for good prize money. In 1933, at a two-day meeting, the multiple champion jockey Gordon Richards won eleven consecutive races at Chepstow – all six races on the first day and the first five races on the next, before being beaten in a close finish in the final race of the meeting.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the entire site became designated as RAF Chepstow, an operational outpost of RAF St. Athan, No. 32 Maintenance Unit RAF. Equipped with only a grass runway in the centre of the course, additional aircraft accommodation for bombers was created at Oakgrove on the opposite side of the road, accessed by stopping the traffic to allow the aircraft to cross. Types stationed on the course during the war included:\n\nAfter the war and the demise of the nearby Caerleon course, the Welsh National was transferred to Chepstow in 1949. From then on, National Hunt racing overtook flat racing as the dominant activity as a string of good class horses and top trainers and jockeys contested the race. The three and three-quarter mile race, more recently known as the Coral Welsh National, owes much to the support of the bookmaking firm for establishing it as one of the major events in the National Hunt calendar. It have sponsored it for over forty years, making it the second longest continuous race sponsorship. \n\nThe opening of the Severn Bridge and the completion of the M4 motorway made the course more accessible to English racegoers.\n\nThe Clay family, which had bought Piercefield House in 1861, were involved with the management course since its formation. Listed on the AIM stock market as a plc in the late 1990s, Sir Stanley Clarke built up an 80% stake in the company and then reversed his existing Northern Racing racecourse holdings into the shell. Clarke took over as executive chairman of the Racecourse Company in 2000, resigning in 2003 before his 2004 death from cancer. Chepstow is now part of the Arena Racing Company, also called ARC Racing and Leisure Group a private UK company, created in 2012 by the merger of Arena Leisure and Northern Racing. It owns and operates several racecourses.\n\n\nChepstow racecourse hosts concerts after evening race meetings:\n\n\n"}

One beam covers the good (short) side of the service line and others cover the fault (long) side. If a served ball hits the first beam, the other beams are turned off, while a long serve will break one of the other beams. A long serve is indicated by an audible signal. Obvious long serves that go beyond Cyclops' beams are called by the service line umpire. \nThe system is tuned before and during each tournament by a representative of the company which rents the system. This representative stays through the tournament and confers with tournament officials afterwards to determine any problems which may have arisen. The system has been constantly refined to improve accuracy, although no statistics on its efficacy are available.\n\nThe Cyclops computer system was introduced to the Wimbledon Championships in 1980 and the U.S. Open in 1981, and was also used at the Australian Open. In 2007 it was removed from Wimbledon's Centre Court and Court No. 1 to allow the use of the Hawk-Eye system first introduced at the U.S. Open in 2006. At the present time Cyclops is not used in any capacity at any of the Grand Slam events.\n\nA famous moment involving Cyclops occurred at Wimbledon in 1980 when Ilie Năstase got down on his hands and knees to talk to the equipment to argue an \"out\" signal.\n\n"}

Unlike other yearbooks, it does not so much focus on professional football, but rather covers the higher amateur leagues.\n\nThe DSFS was formed on 1 July 1971 but was only registered in 1979. It was formed by six football enthusiasts after Helmut Druwen posted an add in the \"kicker\" sport magazine looking for people interested in football statistics. Having grown to a membership of 50, another add in the \"kicker\" in 1978 pushed the membership drive ahead and in 1979 the club finally became properly registered, joining the German Olympic Society as well.\n\nFrom 1980, the club started publishing brochures and a club magazine. But after 1983, the \"DSFS\" went into decline for the first time, recovering only in 1986 from several years of inactivity.\n\nWith the re-establishment of the \"Regionalliga\" in German football in 1994, a reform of the clubs annual publication was started. Year by year until 2004 the contents was expanded until covering all divisions of German football on the top five levels including the top youth and women's leagues. Consequently, the name ofthis annual publication was changed to \"Deutschlands Fussball in Zahlen\" (English: \"Germanys football by numbers\").\n\nIn 1998, it was declared \"Gemeinnützig\", similar to a Non-profit organization, which entitles German clubs to certain tax benefits. In 2004, the number of members was at its peak with almost 430 members. Since then the club lost several of them and now has approximately 363 members (2015 census).\n\nAs of September 2006, the clubs president is Dirk Henning.\n\n\n"}

The record attendance for the stadium was on September 20, 2014 against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with 51,082 in attendance. The stadium is also the site of Spring Commencement exercises for the University.\n\nThe initiative to build a new stadium was announced on October 7, 1961. On that day, President Leo Jenkins announced to a meeting of boosters, that a new stadium will be built to replace College Stadium. By 1962, over $280,000 was raised and Ficklen Memorial Stadium was built. The stadium was named for James Skinner Ficklen, the owner of Greenville's E.B. Skinner Tobacco Company. Skinner was a booster of the college, and established a scholarship fund in his name. The original stadium included permanent stands on the south side, a press box, and a lighting system. Ficklen Memorial Stadium opened on September 21, 1963 with a win against Wake Forest. The original seating capacity was 10,000.\n\nThe north side permanent seating was constructed in 1967 and 1968, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 20,000. The seats were designed by W.M. Freeman Associates from High Point, North Carolina. The exterior of the stadium was painted in 1970 by F.A. Miller Company. The lighting system was the next item that changed. The original lighting system was replaced with six towers outside of the stadium in 1975. The cost of the new lighting system was $450,000. L.E. Wooten company built the lighting system.\n\nThe next addition occurred two years later. The university added seats to the four corners increased the seating capacity to 35,000. This addition made Ficklen Memorial Stadium the third largest stadium in North Carolina. The expansion was funded by a $2.5 million drive in the spring of 1977. The three-story press box which is currently in use was built during that expansion. The press box had space for 92 writers and an entire floor for electronic media. Lastly, scoreboard with a lightbank message center was placed on the east end of the stadium. The playing surface was redone in 1983. A new drainage system, new base of gravel and sand, new treated topsoil, and a new grass—Tifton 419 Hybrid Bermuda were all installed. A new sound system was built in 1988.\n\nIn 1991, $1.6 million in renovations and repairs were accomplished on the stadium.\n\nRonald and Mary Ellen Dowdy of Orlando, Florida, donated one million dollars during a fund-raising drive in 1994. Because of this donation, Ficklen Memorial Stadium was renamed Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium. Also that year the roads were improved around the stadium. A year later, Al and Debbie Bagwell of Lake Gaston, Virginia donated to the East Carolina Educational Foundation. Because of this donation, the field inside the stadium was named Bagwell Field.\n\nThe upper deck on the north side was completed in 1998. It increased the capacity to 40,000. This was the first seating capacity increase since 1977. A year later the club level on the north side was completed. It added 3,000 seats to the total capacity. During the expansion of the upper deck and club level, the press box received improvements. In 1999, a $2 million scoreboard was built in the east endzone. Also that year a Pirate sculpture was dedicated in the southeast area of the stadium. The three-ton bronze sculpture is over tall. Irwin Belk gave the sculpture to the school. Jodi Hollnagel, a faculty member of the School of Art created the sculpture.<ref name=\"Minges Coliseum/Williams Arena - Building Histories\"></ref>\n\nThe $13 million Murphy Center was dedicated on September 13, 2002. It was built in the west endzone of the stadium. It connects the stadium to Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum. The strength and conditioning, banquet rooms, sport memorabilia, and an academic enhancement center building was named for Pete and Lynn Murphy of Rose Hill, North Carolina.\n\nThe next expansion began in December 2009. The expansion included removing the scoreboard located in the east end zone. 7,000 seats were built in its place. The seats connect the north and south sides in a horseshoe pattern. Those seats increased the capacity to 50,000. Restroom and concession stands were built under the new section. Above the east end zone, a new scoreboard was built. The high-definition scoreboard is wide and a little over tall. The LED portion is wide. This makes the new scoreboard the 22nd largest scoreboard in NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision. On the north and south sides of the stadium, 10,200 chair-back seats were installed. Lastly, another scoreboard was built on the west end zone in front of the Murphy Center. The total cost of the expansion was $20 million.\n\nIn May 2016, East Carolina revealed a $55 million renovation project for Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium, which is a portion of its athletic facilities master plan.\n\nThe project, which is slated to begin construction after the 2017 football season and was to be completed in time for the 2018 football season, has been extended to a 16-18 month construction period. The renovation includes:\n\n\nOn November 14, 1970, the visiting Marshall University Thundering Herd lost a game 17-14 to the Pirates at Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium, which ended with Marshall quarterback Ted Shoebridge controversially being called for intentional grounding on the last play of the game. Later that evening, while on approach to Huntington Tri-State Airport, the Marshall football team's plane, which had been chartered to transport the Thundering Herd to and from Greenville, crashed, killing all 75 people on board.\n\nOn December 11, 2006, a plaque was erected at the visitors' entrance to Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium.

{"id": "2451803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2451803", "title": "Falkirk Stadium", "text": "Falkirk Stadium\n\nThe Falkirk Stadium is a football stadium in Falkirk, central Scotland, which is the home ground of Scottish Championship club, Falkirk. The stadium has a capacity of and currently consists of three fully completed stands.\n\nThe stadium was opened in 2004 with the main stand completed. It became the home of Falkirk in the same year after the club ground shared Ochilview Park for the 2003–04 season whilst the stadium was being constructed. The north and south stands were built and opened in 2005 and 2009 respectively.\n\nWork began on building the stadium in 2003 after Brockville Park, the club's town centre home since 1885, was sold and demolished.\n\nThe project of building the stadium was a partnership between Falkirk Football Club and Falkirk Council who set up the Falkirk Community Stadium Ltd which provided the funds to construct and run the stadium. Falkirk Council estimated £6.1 million would be required for the first stage of the Community Stadium build and would contribute £3.1 million initially. The sale of Brockville Park amounted to £9 million pounds for the club, of which £2.8 million went towards the build, whilst £200,000 came from sportscotland.\n\nThe first stage of the stadium was completed in time for the 2004–05 football season and Falkirk moved in after spending the previous year ground-sharing with local rivals, Stenhousemuir at their Ochilview Park home.\nFalkirk's first ever game at the stadium was a friendly in July 2004 against Dundee resulting in a 2–1 defeat. A month later the first league game was hosted in the stadium with visitors Hamilton Academical drawing 1–1.\n\nIn October 2004 construction work commenced for the building of a second stand to the north of the pitch. The stand has a capacity of 2,000. After completion, the £1.58m facility would bring the stadium's capacity to over the Scottish Premier League's 6,000 seating criteria meaning Falkirk would be allowed automatic promotion from the First Division. The stand received its safety certificate in late March 2005, shortly before the SPL's deadline for a stadium which met the seating criteria. By May of the same year the north stand was fully completed.\n\nConstruction of the south stand began in December 2008 by contractors Ogilvie. A £2m pledge from Sandy Alexander, founder of Schuh and Falkirk supporter, helped fund the project. The south stand has a capacity of around 2,000 and is identical in appearance to the north stand of the stadium. It was officially opened in August 2009 in a friendly game against Royal Antwerp FC of Belgium. This brought the capacity of the stadium to around 8,000 people without the inclusion of the temporary east stand.\n\nThe joint venture that was set up between Falkirk F.C. and Falkirk Council, ended in 2009, just a few months before the opening of the south stand. The football club took full control of the facilities such as the pitch, seats, under-soil heating and floodlights, whilst the council retained most of the development rights for the site and manages and receives rent from businesses set up the stadium's main west stand.\n\nAn artificial playing surface was installed at the stadium in June 2013. In 2016 Lowland Football League side Stirling University F.C. started playing their home matches at the ground, having moved from Stirling Albion's Forthbank Stadium.\n\nIn April 2018 it was announced that East Stirlingshire would begin playing their home matches at the Falkirk Stadium from the start of the 2018–19 season. The club had previously played in the centre of Falkirk at Firs Park until 2008, before spending a decade ground-sharing with Stenhousemuir at Ochilview Park.\n\nThe Falkirk Stadium is an all-seater stadium which currently consists of three completed stands in the form of the main west stand and smaller north and south stands. Upon the stadium's construction the west stand was the first to be built, and subsequently completed in 2004. The north and south stands were completed in 2005 and 2009 respectively. The west stand has a capacity of roughly 4,200 and hosts several facilities which have ranged from a nursery to a restaurant. A temporary east stand has been present on several occasions.\n\nAs well as hosting Falkirk F.C., the stadium has also staged several youth level international rugby union matches. In 2008 the stadium was the venue chosen by the Scottish Rugby Union to host Scotland's home matches at the Six Nations Under 20s Championship which were played against England under-20s and France under-20s. Former Falkirk manager John Hughes had commented on the condition of the pitch which was previously damaged during rugby matches.\n\nThe stadium is also used on occasion by the Scotland women's national football team in World and Euro qualifying championships as well as in friendly matches. Also in relation to football, the stadium has hosted the home matches of the Scotland national under-21 football team, the first happening in November 2004 in a game against Sweden.\n\nThe Falkirk Stadium hosts summer music concerts, marketed under the \"Rock The Stadium\" brand. The first act to appear at the Falkirk Stadium was Elton John, on 10 June 2012 as part of his Greatest Hits Tour. In subsequent years, Status Quo (23 June 2013), Midge Ure (22 June 2013), Rod Stewart (21 June 2014) Tom Jones (1 August 2015), Madness (4th August 2017), Jess Glynne (5th August 2017) and Little Mix (27 July 2018) \nHave Performed\n\nThe Falkirk Stadium is within a 30-minute walk of Falkirk Grahamston railway station which is on the main Edinburgh to Dunblane Line and Cumbernauld Line from Glasgow. During weekdays and Saturdays alternate trains between Glasgow and Cumbernauld call at Falkirk Grahamston.\n\nSpecial match day bus services provided by First Scotland East allow direct transport to the stadium from around the Falkirk area. The number 98 service from Brightons passes through Shieldhill, Hallglen and Laurieston before terminating at the stadium. Access from Larbert on match days is provided by the number 99 bus, which is destined for the stadium via Stenhousemuir, Carronshore and Bainsford. As well as the special match day routes, regular services are also provided by First Scotland East from Falkirk bus station to Grangemouth (routes 3 and 4/4A and 4B) and Bo'ness (routes 5/5A and 5C) which stop outside the stadium.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1222251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1222251", "title": "Firhill Stadium", "text": "Firhill Stadium\n\nFirhill Stadium is a football and former rugby union, rugby league and greyhound racing stadium located in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, Scotland. Since 1909, the stadium has been the home of Partick Thistle, who will compete in the Scottish Championship in the 2018–19 season, after five years in the Scottish Premiership. The stadium is commonly referred to as simply Firhill, although since September 2017 it has also become known as The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill for sponsorship reasons.\n\nPast ground-sharing agreements have seen Firhill act as a temporary home for two other football clubs, Clyde and Hamilton Academical. It was also a venue for the 2000 Rugby League World Cup and the Glasgow Warriors rugby union team between 2007 and 2012. Furthermore, the stadium was used for a short time by Queen's Park during the 2012 Summer Olympics as their own Hampden Park stadium was in use for the Olympic football competitions. , the all-seated capacity of Firhill is .\n\nPartick Thistle played at various sites between 1876 and 1891, including Kelvingrove, Jordanvale Park and Muir Park. The club settled at Meadowside, beside the River Clyde, in 1891. They were forced out of this site in 1908, however, to make way for a shipyard. The club found some spare Caledonian Railway land in Maryhill, the site was purchased by the club for £5,500, and construction started soon after. The ground was due to open on 21 August 1909, but the match was postponed because it had not been declared safe for public use and planning consent had not been obtained. Firhill opened a month later. \nThe record attendance for a Partick Thistle game at Firhill was set against Rangers in 1922, when 49,838 people attended. The present main stand was constructed in 1927, at which time the terraces were expanded. Although the main stand resembles an Archibald Leitch design, it was in fact designed by David Mills Duncan, who had previously worked for Leitch. The stadium's attendance record was set by the 1928 British Home Championship match between Scotland and Ireland, when 54,728 people attended.\n\nThere were no further improvements until the early 1950s, when Thistle had a relatively successful period. This success financed a roof over part of the terracing and floodlights, which were first used in a friendly match against Tottenham Hotspur in November 1955. Firhill hosted the first European Cup match ever to be played in Glasgow, when Swedish club Djurgården played their \"home\" match against Hibernian in 1955–56. Djurgårdens played at Firhill because of the freezing conditions in Sweden at the time of the match.\n\nFirhill became designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act in 1977, which reduced its capacity from over 40,000 to 20,500. In 1986, Firhill became the first Scottish ground in modern times to be used by more than one team, when Clyde moved in after being evicted from Shawfield. This arrangement lasted until 1991. Hamilton Academical then shared Firhill with Thistle in two different spells, the first arrangement beginning in 1994. To cope with the resulting additional usage, undersoil heating was installed in 1994.\n\nThe North Stand was built in 2002 to meet the Scottish Premier League criteria on stadium capacity, which stated at the time that member clubs must have 10,000 seats in their ground. Ironically this criterion was later changed to only 6,000 seats, which not only allowed for the relegation of Partick Thistle, but meant they had constructed a stand which cost the club unnecessarily. Originally, the stand only ran for two thirds the length of the pitch, but it was extended in 2003. The construction of this stand was assisted by the sale of some land to allow the construction of student flats which now lie behind the stand.\n\nThe modern stadium comprises three seated stands, with an unused area at the south end. The current capacity of the ground includes seats with no standing areas available. The Main Stand was built with an original capacity of 6,000 seats, however in recent times only around 3,000 of which have been used. In January 2006, the club announced that the Main Stand would no longer be used on matchdays due to high maintenance and stewarding costs. There were exceptions to this, such as a Scottish Cup match against Rangers and for Glasgow Warriors matches against Edinburgh. When Thistle achieved promotion to the Scottish Premiership in 2013, the Main Stand was reopened to house away supporters, and has been used for this purpose ever since. The Main Stand was renamed the Colin Weir Stand in 2016 in tribute to the club's first ever patron.\nAll home fans are now housed in the stand opposite the old stand, the Jackie Husband Stand. The stand is a large cantilever building, and was constructed in December 1994 with a capacity of 6,263 and is named after former Thistle player Jackie Husband. The newest stand is the north stand, at one end of the ground. This was built in 2002 to replace the old terracing, in order to comply with SPL standards. This has a capacity of 2,014, houses Thistle's singing section and was named after former Thistle manager John Lambie in April 2018.\n\nIn 2010, Thistle had announced plans to replace the disused terracing at the south end of the ground, commonly known as the \"City End\" with a new structure that would consist of a 1,000-seat stand as well as residential and office accommodation. However, planning permission from Glasgow City Council was not forthcoming. The grassy bank at the City End has come to be known by the fans as \"The Bing\".\n\nOn 7 November 2014, it was announced that planning permission had been submitted to Glasgow City Council to redevelop the southern end of the stadium. On this site, a new 450-seater stand will be built, complete with 79 residential flats and also office and retail space. The proposals are identical to those issued to the council in July 2010. Tim Clark of ZM Architecture, the company handling the application, stated: \"The timescale for concluding the original consent has now ceased and our client wishes to resubmit the original application as they still have intentions to develop the site, which was interrupted by the downturn in the financial market in the intervening years.\"\n\nIn December 2005, Firhill became the home of Glasgow's professional rugby union team, Glasgow Warriors, when they moved from their previous base at Hughenden Stadium. After returning to Hughenden in 2006, the Warriors took up a two-year residency at Firhill from the start of the 2007–08 Celtic League season. This was extended in April 2009 for a further five years. Glasgow Warriors left Firhill after the 2011–12 season and moved to Scotstoun Stadium.\n\nIn 1996, Firhill was the site of the Scottish national rugby league team's first game on home soil, with a victory against Ireland. Rugby league, very much a minority sport in Scotland, has returned to the ground on several occasions since, including for the 2000 World Cup.\n\nGreyhound Racing took place from 1928 until 1957. An oval greyhound circuit 400 yards in circumference was added to the stadium around the football pitch in 1928 and a totalisator board was erected above the second bend between terracing. The racing started on 23 April 1928 as an independent (unlicenced) track before the joining of the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS) in 1933.\n\nLicensed racing started on Monday 23 January 1933 with a hastily arranged meeting; greyhounds had only qualifying to race on the previous Thursday, Friday and Saturday trial sessions. The company responsible for the greyhound racing was the Firhill Greyhound Racing Company Limited and their managing director was John Bilsland, the same man that formed part of syndicates responsible for opening Southend-on-Sea (Kursaal) and having interests in three Liverpool greyhound tracks. Racing took place at Firhill every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at 7.45pm with races held over 280 and 480 yards (mainly handicaps).\n\nThe extra revenue helped Partick Thistle overcome serious financial difficulties and when the BGTCS disbanded in 1935 the stadium management\nheaded by David Mitchell and W I Bilsland joined the National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) and continued to capitalise on a greyhound racing boom. By March 1950 falling attendances and competition from other Glasgow tracks forced Firhill to resign from their NGRC affiliation. The chairman John Bilsland stated that the cost of NGRC membership exceeded £1,000 per year. During January 1957 Racing Manager Ernest Ganly announced that the track was going to close to greyhound racing. He blamed falling attendances but the owner trainers disagreed citing the policy of only running company owned greyhounds at the track as being the main cause.\n\nFirhill was used heavily in 2000 as a location for the television series \"Taggart\" in the episode \"Football Crazy\", in which the fictional team Strathclyde F.C. wore the same kits as Thistle and played at the ground. The stadium also featured in the BBC television drama \"Single Father\" starring Scottish actor David Tennant.\n\nMaryhill railway station, which is served by trains from Glasgow Queen Street, is the closest railway station to Firhill. The walk between the two sites takes between 20 and 25 minutes. Firhill is better served by the Glasgow Subway network, with Kelvinbridge and St George's Cross stations within 15 minutes walk of the stadium. The A81 road (Maryhill Road), leading to Firhill Road, runs from the M8 motorway.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "975760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=975760", "title": "Footvolley", "text": "Footvolley\n\nFootvolley (, in Brazil, \"Futevólei\" in Portugal) is a sport which combines aspects of beach volleyball and association football.\n\nFootvolley was created by Octavio de Moraes in 1965 in Brazil. Footvolley combines field rules that are based on those of beach volleyball with ball-touch rules taken from association football. Essentially footvolley is beach volleyball except players are not allowed to use their hands and a football replaces the volleyball.\n\nFootvolley was created by Octavio de Moraes in 1965 in Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach. The game of footvolley was first called 'pevoley', literally meaning \"footvolley\", but that name was discarded in favor of\"futevôlei\". Footvolley started in Rio de Janeiro, according to one player because football was banned on the beach, but volleyball courts were open. The sport had spread to Recife, Salvador, Brasília, Goiânia, Santos and Florianópolis by the 1970s.\nTeams of footvolley had five a side at first. Due to the skill level of the footvolley athletes (nearly all were professional football players), the ball would rarely drop. The players began lowering the number of players on each side, eventually settling on 2 versus 2, which is still in use today.\n\nIn recent years, professional football players have taken up footvolley in both promotional events and celebrity matches. Some notable Brazilian footballers who have played (or still play) footvolley are: Romário, Edmundo, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho Gaúcho, Júnior, and Edinho (1982 & 1986 National Team).\n\nThe first International Footvolley event to occur outside of Brazil was in 2003 by the United States Footvolley Association on Miami Beach at the 2003 Fitness Festival. This event led to international players and teams in pursuit of federation status. A tournament was held during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, as a demonstration sport.\n\nAn indoor footvolleyball looks like a basketball, but at only 360g, it is smaller in diameter, bouncier, and heavier than a volleyball.\n\nFootvolley combines field rules that are based on those of beach volleyball with ball-touch rules taken from association football. Essentially footvolley is beach volleyball except players are not allowed to use their hands and a football replaces the volleyball.\n\nPoints are awarded if the ball hits the ground in the opponents court, if the opponents commit a fault, or if they fail to return the ball over the net. Scoring is done using the rally point system (new volleyball rules). Match scoring is usually up to the event organizer's discretion. Generally speaking matches are one set to 18 points; or best of three sets to 15 points (with third set to 11 points). The court is 29.5 feet x 59 ft (old beach volleyball). The height of the net varies based on the competition. The Official International Rule for the net height set is 2.2 meters or 7 feet 2 inches for the men's competition. For the women's competition, the height of the net should be set at 2 meters or 6 feet 6 inches.\n\nSince the sport's inception in Brazil, footvolley has spread and gained popularity internationally, including the Americas, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia, and Oceania.\n\nMajor events have been held at many beach cities in countries around the world, including Spain, Portugal, Greece, United Arab Emirates, France, the Netherlands, Aruba, Thailand, South Africa, Paraguay, etc. as well as its own native Brazil.\n\nParaguay was the first world champion of footvolley. The Paraguayan Jesús is considered the best player in the World Championship.\n\nBrasília (the capital of Brazil) has produced players like Gabriel, Xeleleu, Jansen de Oliveira, Ramiro, Betola, Edinho, Hugão and Luisinho who are till today in activity and besides their admired carriers, they also taught other popular young players, including Belo, Marcelinho, Mário, Café, Diego and Lana (in female and unisex footvolley).\n\nIn April 2006, the England Team accompanied football legends John Barnes and Niall Quinn to a tournament in Pattaya, Thailand organized by the Thai Footvolley Federation.\n\nIn 2007 the two events held were the Muller Rice Open in Croyde, and the Lamisil Once Footvolley Open in Brighton. Dirceu and Luigi were champions at both events, maintaining their unbeaten record and David and Gary, the England Footvolley Team No. 1 pair won the Shield Competition.\n\nFootvolley was first played in Israel in 2003 when a few beach boys from Gordon Beach, Tel Aviv learned about the exciting game from two Brazilian soccer players who played for Israeli teams. It was in 2007 that Corona in Israel got involved in footvolley, establishing the first footvolley ordinary league already in 2008.\n\nCorona FootVolley League, so far the only ordinary footvolley league in the world, is played since 2008 every summer starting in May/June until the final four in September/October with 12 teams and 11 league rounds in the Premier league and 12 teams playing 11 rounds in the Masters league.\n\nIn 2009 Corona FootVolley European Tour was established by inviting teams from Europe to play in Israel. In 2011 Corona FootVolley European Tour was upgraded to Corona FootVolley World Tour inviting teams from all over the world to play.\n\nCorona FootVolley Winter Cup, a two-day tournament, is also played in Israel every February since 2010.\n\nThe first Footvolley Italia Tour was in 2008 when a group of friends from Ravenna organized the event. Normally the tour is in the months of June, July and August and the tournaments that compose the tour are 4-5 a year. In Italy are used the international rules:court 9mx9m and the net 2,20m.\n\nFootvolley Australia (FVA) is the first peak body responsible for footvolley in Australia. FVA was founded in 2007 in the Northern Beaches of Sydney, Australia. The organisation was formed to establish, guide and promote footvolley in Australia. The FVA are working on the development of the practice of footvolley by organising Footvolley Experience sessions for newcomers to the sport; footvolley education and coaching across Australia; the National Footvolley Tour; and participation in international competitions. Footvolley Australia is working with relevant international associations, especially in the Asia and Oceania regions, to promote the growth of the game.\n\nIn the United States, footvolley began in South Florida. Local promoters organized the 2002 Impulse Energy drink South Beach Footvolley Tournament which was won by Adrian Boente. In 2005, the United States Footvolley Association was created in Miami Beach. Every year since 2005 a National Championship has been held. The first National Championship was held December 11, 2005. The winning side was Franco Cappuotti (Hollywood, FL) and Claudio Rodriguez (Orlando, FL). Runners-up were Adriano Boente and Alberto 'Betto' Lima.

In 1964 she finished fourth in the hurdles and sixth in the shot put, but won gold in the newly introduced pentathlon event.\n\nTogether with her elder sister Tamara, Irina set 26 world records between 1959 and 1966. The careers of both Press sisters ended abruptly at the time that gender verification was organized at the location of the games. Critics have suggested that the Press sisters were male or intersex. Another allegation was that they were being injected with male hormones in order to make them stronger. Detractors called them the \"Press Brothers\".\n\nAfter retiring from competitions Press earned a degree in physical education and coached at her club Dynamo Moscow. She also took various posts in the Soviet sports administration, such as department head of the Soviet and later Russian State Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Tourism.

{"id": "459510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=459510", "title": "Sliding tackle", "text": "Sliding tackle\n\nA sliding tackle or slide tackle is a tackle in association football. It is completed with one leg extended to push the ball away from the opposing player.\nSliding tackles can often be sources of controversy, particularly when players being tackled fall down over the tackler's foot (or the ball stopped by the tackler's foot), and penalties, free kicks and cards are assessed (or are conspicuous by their absence).\n\nA sliding tackle is not in itself foul play; however, there are a number of fouls that commonly occur during the execution of a sliding tackle.\n\nExamples of such fouls punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick include:\n\"Careless\" means that the player has shown a lack of attention of consideration when making a challenge or that he acted without precaution. \"Reckless\" means that the player has acted with complete disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, his opponent. \"Using excessive force\" means that the player has far exceeded the necessary use of force and is in danger of injuring an opponent.\n\n\"Careless\" challenges are punished by only a direct free kick or penalty kick. However, \"reckless\" challenges are also punished with a caution (yellow card) for unsporting behaviour as well as a direct free kick or penalty kick, while challenges committed with \"excessive force\" are also punished with a send-off (red card) for serious foul play as well as a direct free kick or penalty kick.\n\n\"Playing in a dangerous manner\" is punishable by an indirect free kick. \"Playing in a dangerous manner\" is defined as any action, that while trying to play the ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player himself). It is committed with an opponent nearby and prevents the opponent from playing the ball for fear of injury. If any physical contact is made, the offence becomes an offence punishable with a direct free kick or penalty kick.\n\nSlide tackles that are made as two-footed lunges at an opponent are generally considered to endanger the safety of an opponent and are hence sanctioned as serious foul play, resulting in a sending-off. This is still the case even if the ball is won cleanly without touching an opponent.\n\nThe slide tackle is attractive to the defender because it allows him to cover a larger area of ground while attempting to dispossess an opponent. It is often a \"last-ditch\" attempt to dispossess an opponent due to frequent misses and the difficulty of recovering in the event that the slide tackle fails to take the ball away. After a slide tackle, the tackler is left sitting or lying on the ground with one leg extended. The tackler therefore also runs the risk of personal injury. Ideally, the other foot ends up folded underneath their rear end, where it can be used to push the tackler back up to their feet to continue play.\n\nIf doing a sliding tackle to the right, the player's right leg must be straight when going down into the tackle and their left leg should be bent slightly behind the right one in order to achieve maximum potential in gaining the ball. If doing a sliding tackle to the left, the player's left leg must be straight and their right leg should be bent slightly behind the left one.\n\n"}

The screenplay was adapted by Art Cohn from a 1928 narrative poem written by Joseph Moncure March. \"The Set-Up\" was the last film Wise made for RKO, and he named it his favorite among the pictures he directed for the studio, as well as one of his top ten during his entire career.\n\nBill \"Stoker\" Thompson (Robert Ryan) is a 35-year-old has-been boxer about to take on an opponent at the fictional Paradise City Arena. His wife, Julie (Audrey Totter), fears that this fight may be his last and wants him to forfeit the match. Tiny (George Tobias), Stoker's manager, is sure he will continue to lose fights, so he takes money for a \"dive\" from a mobster, but is so certain of Stoker's failure that he does not inform the boxer of the set-up.\n\nThe beginning of the film shows Stoker and Julie in their room at the Hotel Cozy, passionately debating whether he should participate in the fight. Julie tells him that she has a headache and won't attend the match. Stoker claims the $500 prize could allow them to buy a cigar stand or invest in another boxer, Tony Martinez, and start a new life. Julie says she cares more about his well-being than money, but Stoker responds: \"If you're a fighter, you gotta fight.\"\n\nAfter Stoker departs for the arena, Julie continues to struggle with her fear and desire to support him, but ultimately ends up not using her ticket to the event and instead roams the streets surrounding the arena.\n\nAt the beginning of the fourth and last round of the vicious match with the much younger and heavily favored Tiger Nelson (Hal Fieberling), Stoker learns about the fix. Even though he is told that Little Boy (Alan Baxter), a feared gangster, is behind the set-up, he refuses to give up the fight.\n\nStoker wins the vocal support of blood-thirsty fans who had at first rooted against him and ends up defeating his opponent. He pays for his decision with a beating in an alley outside the arena from Little Boy, Tiger Nelson, and their cronies. The group irreparably damages Stoker's hand with a smash from a brick.\n\nThe story closes with Julie meeting Stoker as he staggers out of the alley and collapses into her arms. \"I won tonight,\" he tells her. \"Yes,\" she answers. \"You won tonight. We both won tonight.\"\n\n\nIn 1947, almost two decades after March's poem was published, RKO paid him a little over $1,000 for the rights to the piece. Although March had nearly a decade of Hollywood writing credits during the 1930s (working on what a 2008 essay in \"The Hudson Review\" called \"one forgotten and now unseeable film after another\"), RKO did not ask him to adapt his own poem.\n\nThe screen adaptation included a number of alterations to the original text. The protagonist's name was changed from Pansy Jones to Stoker Thompson, his race was changed from black to white, he went from being a bigamist to being devotedly married, and his beating and subsequent death on a subway track was turned into an alley assault and a shattered hand. The opponent's name was changed from Sailor Gray to Tiger Nelson.\n\nIn an audio commentary accompanying the 2004 DVD release of the film, Robert Wise attributes the change in the protagonist's race to the fact that RKO had no African-American star actors under contract. Although the film did have an African American actor (James Edwards) in a minor role as another boxer, Edwards was not a \"star\" under the then existing studio rules. March later commented in an \"Ebony\" interview, saying:\n\nRobert Ryan, who was cast as Stoker Thompson, had boxing experience from his time at Dartmouth College, where he was heavyweight champion for four years in a row.\n\nWise and Sid Rogell had first thought of Joan Blondell to play Julie, following her performance as Zeena Krumbein in \"Nightmare Alley\", but RKO owner Howard Hughes refused, saying \"Blondell looks like she was shot out of the wrong end of a cannon now\".\n\nDore Schary, the uncredited executive producer who got the project going at RKO before his 1948 move to MGM, is credited with giving the film a real time narrative structure, three years before the device was used in \"High Noon\". Viewers are shown the passage of time throughout the film:\n\nPrior to \"The Set-Up\", Richard Goldstone's production credits had been limited to a half-dozen \"Our Gang\" comedy shorts.\n\nThe fight scene, which features an exchange of blows between Stoker and his opponent that is very close to the original poem, was choreographed by former professional boxer Johnny Indrisano. Wise used three cameras to capture the action: one focused on the ring in its entirety; one on the fighters; and a third, hand-held device to catch details such as a glove connecting with a body.\n\nWhen the film was released \"The New York Times\" reviewed the drama and lauded the picture's screenplay and the realistic depiction of the boxing \"milieu\"; they wrote:\n\nJefferson Hunter, in a summer 2008 essay for \"The Hudson Review\", said:\n\nWins\n\nNominated\n\n"}
