There was virtually nothing produced in the great divide caused by World War II. Up to 1941 manufacturers like Gum Inc. (later Bowman) and Goudey, had raised the bar on the confection industry by leaving behind the tobacco age of marketing to adults and bringing forth the bubble gum age and marketing to children. Topps had been primarily a gum company but took up adding premiums to their products after the war. Their first sets featured various sizes and numerous topics, mostly non-sport. The most notable is the Bazooka Gum comics although the earlier issues did not yet feature Joe and his gang. Below are descriptions of Topps products that were issued in the 1940s.\n\n1948 Topps Magic Photos (R714-27)\n\nThis set contains 252 small individual cards featuring sport and non-sport subjects. They were issued in 19 lettered series with cards numbered within each series. The 'magic' of the cards were the fact that they came out of the pack blank until the image was revealed by moistening the surface and applying the developing agent which was supplied by the wrapper in a one cent pack or a piece of orange mystery paper supplied in the five cent packs. The subsets by group letter are: A Boxing Champions, B All-American Basketball, C All-American Football, D Wrestling Champions, E Track & Field Champions, F Stars of Stage & Screen, G American Dogs, H General Sports, I \"None issued\", J Movie Stars, K Baseball Hall of Fame, L Aviation Pioneers, M Famous Landmarks, N American Inventors, O American Military Leaders, P American Explorers, Q Basketball Thrills, R Football Thrills, S Figures of the Wild West, T General Sports. Size: × in (2.2 × 3.7 cm) \n\n1949 Spalding Sports Show \n\nThese are a set of rust colored cartoons that deal with numerous sports. The illustrator of the cartoons is Willard Mullin. They were found on the inside of the foil wrapper of Bazooka gum. Size: 2 ×  inches\n\n1947-49 Bazooka Comics As a way to boost sales Topps began putting small comic strips as inner wrappers for their gum. These comics were reprints of strips from DC and Fawcett. Titles such as 'Doc Sorebones' and 'Peg' were found in varying sizes in Bazooka Gum from 1947 to 1948. In 1949 Topps began using a character called 'Bazooka, The Atom Bubble Boy' that represented something of a personage of the product. These comics that featured the Bubble Boy were done in a dull rust color making them hard to read. Despite their quality they would represent the precursor to the famous Bazooka Joe comics.\n\n1948 Tattoo Bubble Gum (150) These items are transfers that feature various generic sport and non-sport drawings. Size: ×  inches.\n\n1948 It Happened to a President (20) These comics are printed on thin tissue which was the interior wrapper of 'Golden Coin Bubble Gum'. The stories are done in rust color and tell of a true event in the life of a president. Size: ×  in.\n\n1949 President Coins (34) The coins in this set are made of gold colored plastic. Each coin is numbered in sequence of each subject's presidency. Like most coins these items feature a bust of the president on the front with an eagle atop a shield on the back. The term of each president is depicted in relief around the portrait of each coin. Size:  in. diameter\n\n1949 Famous Events (~60) This set was a series of comics that doubled as a gum wrapper. Alternately titled 'On This Day in History' the rust colored comics feature artwork of a special event on a particular day in history. Above the picture is a panel describing the event while a panel below the artwork offers astrological data for people born on the respective day. Size: 2 ×  inches\n\n1949 Flags of all Nations & Soldiers of the World (~32) These cards are double features in that they have two fronts. The Soldiers appeared on the glossy cardboard side while the Flags were printed on shiny patterned cloth on the other side. Size: ×  inches\n\n1949 Flags of the World Parade (100) These Flags are a larger size as well as an expanded version of the above Flags & Soldiers set. This issue has five subsets divided by continent. There are flags of countries as well as service branches, naval standards, and confederated republics. The cards have both a set number and a subset number. The backs have a brief explanation of the flag. To the left of the text and below the set number is a line drawing of the soldier. Size: ×  inches\n\n1949 Flip-O-Vision (50) This is a set of flip books that make a mini movie. Out of the packs the books were 30 pages folded like an accordion. The pages had to be separated and then bound together with string or thread to be used as a flip movie. The subjects featured are various celebrities performing their craft. Size: × 4 inches\n\n1949 License Plates (75) This set offered another double feature type card for the consumer. One side of the cards are license plates for every state as well as District of Columbia and Quebec while the other side posed a question about a car or landmark. The question side of the cards had a gray coating over 70 percent of it while the remainder had the question. The answer to the question was underneath the coating. Size: ×  inches\n\n1949 Play Coins of the World (120) These play coins are plastic coated with either brass, copper, or nickel depending on their denomination. There are three different denominations for each country which are 25, 50 and 100. The coins were distributed with either gum or lollipops. Size:  inch diameter\n\n1949 The Story of the Atom Bomb (18) The A-Bomb set was printed on the inside of the gum trays instead of the actual gum wrappers. The stories are printed on one half of the panel while the other half had a mail-in premium offer. Size: ×  inches\n\n1949 X-Ray Round Up (200) This issue was a series of well colored and nicely detailed small size cards. The set had four subsets of fifty cards each. The subsets are Figures of the Wild West, Indian Chiefs, Pirates of the Spanish Main, and Savage Tribesmen. The X-Ray concept deals with the images on the back of the cards which were drawn with wavy orange lines. Also visible on the picture are very fine blue-green lines. A red X-Ray slip that was included could be used over the picture where the blue-green lines would reveal a hidden picture with a caption. Size: ×  inches\n\n"}

He was rotated with Jefry Mohammad and Ibrahim Abu Bakar as Brunei suffered relegation, and in the following season competed with a young Wardun Yussof for the goalkeeper position as Brunei began life in Malaysia's Premier Two. He also made appearances for his future club DPMM FC in the AFC Champions League against Geylang FC in 2002. When DPMM replaced Brunei in the Malaysia Premier League at the start of the 2005–06 season, Alizanda transferred immediately to the royally-owned club. He gained promotion to the Malaysia Super League with DPMM but was largely second fiddle to Wardun. He was released in early 2009 following DPMM's signing of Azman Ilham Noor from NBT FC.\n\nIn the 2016 close season, DPMM announced that Alizanda had signed a contract after the release of Azman. Due to his age, he was assumed to be holding a coaching role but his head coach Steve Kean has confirmed that Alizanda will compete for the goalkeeping position with Wardun, rekindling a rivalry last occurred eight years ago. \n\nOn 2 April 2017, Alizanda started the match against Hougang United and kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory. It was his first competitive match in 8 years and made him the oldest player to play in the S.League aged 46 years, 8 months and 4 days. He made four league appearances in total, the last being a 9–3 drubbing by Home United. His age was 46 years, 9 months and 26 days on that date.\n"}

The park opened in 1941 and held as many as 5,000 people in a covered grandstand which extended from first base to third base. It was primarily used for baseball, and served as the home field for the Charlotte Hornets, the farm team for the Washington Senators from 1937 to 1961, and Minnesota Twins from 1961 to 1972, and the Charlotte Orioles, a AA Southern League farm team of the Baltimore Orioles from 1976 to 1987. After a renovation of the park in 1976 for the O's, the park was renamed Jim Crockett Memorial Park in 1977 (but was mostly called Crockett Park), both in honor of the promoter who brought the team, and to distance themselves from the former owners. The park was almost completely burned down on March 16, 1985. Investigators determined the fire was set by juveniles.\n\nThe Crockett family built a 3,000-seat makeshift stadium soon after the fire. However, it was completely exposed to the elements. The O's attendance fell off over the next 2 seasons, 1986, and 1987, because there was no protection for the fans. When the Charlotte O's last season was over George Shinn bought the team, and the stadium, and renamed it Knights Park. The team was renamed Knights out of a naming contest to distance the similarity between the major league affiliate. The new Charlotte \"Knights\" only played there for their first season in 1988, and in 1989, the team switched affiliates to the Chicago White Sox, and moved to the new and much bigger ballpark in Fort Mill SC, the \"Castle\" or Knights Stadium.\n\n"}

The stadium was named after the old nickname of the school, the Indians, until the 2007 season when it was renamed ASU Stadium. The venue was again renamed in September 2012 after Liberty Bank donated approximately $5 million to the university, and was renamed in 2013 after Liberty Bank was bought by Centennial Bank. The stadium currently has a capacity of 30,406.\n\nThe stadium opened in 1974 however construction was not completely finished until prior to the 1975 season. Not all bleachers had been installed by the start of the 1974 season and lights were not installed until after the season. Despite not being fully completed, the Arkansas State football team began play there in 1974. The original cost of the stadium was $2.5 million of which $1.4 million was raised by friends and alumni of the university. The first game played in the stadium was on September 28, 1974 against Louisiana Tech University and Arkansas State lost 21–7. The first victory in the stadium was a 14–7 win over Eastern Michigan University on October 5, 1974. A dedication game was played on November 2, 1974 against Northeast Louisiana University and Arkansas State won the game 17–14.\n\nThe stadium originally had a capacity of 16,343 when it first opened. This was upgraded in 1980 to a capacity of 18,709. Further expansion was completed in 1991, when Arkansas State moved up from Division I-AA (FCS) to Division I-A (FBS) and new capacity requirements had to be met to keep up with this status, making the capacity 30,708. The grandstand was double-decked with seats and Indian Stadium had a four level press area that includes the press box and two donor levels: Happy Hunting Grounds and Chiefs Council. The area also includes a photo deck complete with an area for filming, Visiting Team AD Suite and coaches booths for both teams. In 2001, a video/scoreboard was erected in the South end zone which cost more than a million dollars to purchase and construct.\n\nIn 2013, Liberty Bank was bought by Centennial Bank, and the naming rights were also absorbed. Liberty Bank Stadium was renamed Centennial Bank Stadium for the 2014 football season.\n\nIn 2002, more improvements were added to the stadium. Luxury suites were added, increasing capacity to its current figure of 30,964. The players and coaches of the school moved into a brand new complex that included office space for coaches, dressing rooms, meeting rooms, and player lounges. When these areas are not being used by staff and players they are used for several different purposes. These areas become suites used during football games, academic study areas for players and students, conference rooms, alumni functions, booster meetings, and recruitment purposes. The complex now houses a place known as the Performance Enhancement Center. Inside this center there are several different areas that include the Athletic Training Center, Strength and Conditioning Center, Student-Athletic Academic Success Center, a computer lab, and other various offices and rooms. In 2005, it was announced that Arkansas State University would replace the natural Bermuda grass field with FieldTurf at a cost of $500,000. However, Pro Green synthetic grass was installed in the stadium prior to the start of the 2006 season.\n\nThanks to a $5 million gift – the largest individual donation in A-State Athletics history – by alumnus Johnny Allison, a “Centennial Expansion” construction and renovation project to the stadium’s press box and west-side concourse took place during the nine-month period between the 2014 and 2015 seasons.\n\nThe entire project, including the press box and concourse, covered 40,000 square feet. The Centennial Expansion project included a complete overhaul to the stadium press box, expanding it from 7,120 to 36,000 square feet. The project also included improvements and additions to the concourse bathrooms, concessions, gating and ticketing areas.\n\nIn 2013, Arkansas State University announced plans to build a $27 million Football Operations Center with an indoor practice field, weight rooms, lockers, medical centers, and staff offices. The plans originally called for the north end zone seating to be removed, but with average attendance being higher than ever, new seating with concession stands and television screens are to be added.\n\nIn 2014, a Daktronics LED video display/scoreboard measuring approximately 32 feet high by 50 feet wide was erected in the south end zone. This replaces the scoreboard erected in 2001.\n\nCentennial Bank Stadium features a multi-level press box, which houses media areas, coaching booths, broadcasting locations, a video control booth, camera areas, suites, a club area and more. The face of the stadium has been redesigned to include 42 loge boxes, 20 suites, a club area covering close to 8,000 square feet and 344 club seats in its revenue-generating areas. Not only has depth been added to the press box, it now spans from approximately the 15-to-15 yard lines, allowing for enhanced media, coaching, broadcasting, control booth, visiting athletics director suite, and camera areas.\n\nThe stadium was also used for a very brief period to showcase a game between the two largest high schools in the Jonesboro-area. The game pitted Jonesboro High School against cross-town rival Nettleton High School. The game was suspended temporarily after Jonesboro won the first two games in blowouts. The average stadium attendance for these games were over 7,000. The rivalry was renewed for the 2006 high school football season and the two schools again played the game in Indian Stadium. Jonesboro won the 2006 game, but it was closer than the previous games; the final score was 44–38. In 2010 a new rivalry started with the Greene County Tech Golden Eagles. This rivalry was known as the \"Border Bowl\" as the counties in which the schools are located (Craighead and Greene) border each other. The series was discontinued as Jonesboro swept the series 4–0. In 2014, a new rivalry was formed with cross-town rival Valley View High School.\n\nThe largest crowd to see an Arkansas State football game in Centennial Bank Stadium was 31,243 on December 1, 2012, when the Red Wolves hosted Middle Tennessee State University. The highest average attendance in the stadium's history was during the 2012 season when Arkansas State drew an average of 26,398 spectators per game.\n\n"}

People with chronic breathing disorders such as asthma use this as a bronchodilator to make breathing easier. It is most commonly available as the hydrochloride salt, clenbuterol hydrochloride.\n\nClenbuterol is a β agonist with some structural and pharmacological similarities to epinephrine and salbutamol, but its effects are more potent and longer-lasting as a stimulant and thermogenic drug. It causes an increase in aerobic capacity, central nervous system stimulation, blood pressure, and oxygen transportation. It increases the rate at which body fat is metabolized while increasing the body's basal metabolic rate (BMR). It is commonly used for smooth muscle-relaxant properties as a bronchodilator and tocolytic.\n\nIt is classified by the World Athletic Doping Association as an anabolic agent, not as a β agonist.\n\nClenbuterol is also prescribed for treatment of respiratory diseases horses, and not in dogs and cats; it is illegal in most countries to use in livestock used for food.\n\nClenbuterol is approved for use in some countries, free or via prescription, as a bronchodilator for asthma patients.\n\nClenbuterol is not an ingredient of any therapeutic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is now banned for IOC-tested athletes. In the US, administration of clenbuterol to any animal that could be used as food for human consumption is banned by the FDA.\n\nAlthough often used by bodybuilders during their \"cutting\" cycles, the drug has been more recently known to the mainstream, particularly through publicized stories of use by celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, Britney Spears, and Lindsay Lohan,\n\nAs a β sympathomimetic, clenbuterol has also been used as a performance-enhancing drug.\n\nA three-year suspension for taking clenbuterol kept sprinter Katrin Krabbe from competing in the 1992 Summer Olympics, and effectively ended her athletic career.\n\nIn 2006, San Francisco Giants pitcher Guillermo Mota, while a member of the New York Mets, received a 50-game suspension after testing positive for clenbuterol. In 2012, MLB officials announced they were again suspending Mota for 100 games due a positive test for clenbuterol.\n\nAmerican swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive at the US trials in 2008. She was subject to a one-year suspension, having claimed she unknowingly took the drug in a contaminated food supplement. Former New York Mets clubhouse employee Kirk Radomski admitted in his plea deal to distributing clenbuterol to dozens of current and former Major League Baseball players and associates. After finishing fourth in the K-2 1000-m event at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Polish sprint canoer Adam Seroczyński was disqualified for taking this drug, and Chinese cyclist Li Fuyu tested positive for it at the Dwars door Vlaanderen race in Belgium on March 24, 2010.\n\nIn 2010, St. Louis Cardinals minor-league shortstop Lainer Bueno received a 50-game suspension for the 2011 season as a result of testing positive for clenbuterol.\n\nCyclist Alberto Contador of Spain was banned for two years from professional cycling after testing positive for the drug at the 2010 Tour de France. He was later stripped of the 2010 title of the Tour de France and the 2011 title of the Giro d'Italia. CAS found that Contador probably tested positive due to a contaminated food supplement. In 2013, Contador's teammate on the Team Saxo Bank squad, Michael Rogers, tested positive for clenbuterol at the Japan Cup bike race. In April 2014, the Union Cycliste Internationale announced that it accepted Rogers' explanation that the substance had been ingested by him after consuming contaminated meat whilst competing at the 2013 Tour of Beijing, upholding Rogers' disqualification from the Japan Cup, but declining to impose any further sanctions on him.\n\nIn 2011, players of the Mexico national football team were found with clenbuterol in their bloodstreams, but were acquitted by WADA after they claimed the clenbuterol came from contaminated food. FIFA has also claimed 109 players from multiple countries\nwho were participating in the Under-17 World Cup in Mexico tested positive for this drug. However, FIFA and the World Anti-Doping Agency declined to prosecute any cases because the weight of evidence pointed to contamination from Mexican meat.\n\nIn 2013, Mexican boxer Erik Morales was suspended for two years after testing positive for clenbuterol.\n\nIn 2014, Toronto Maple Leafs Forward Carter Ashton was suspended from the NHL for 20 games without pay for violating the NHL/NHL Players' Association Performance Enhancing Substances Program after it was determined that he had ingested clenbuterol. Carter claimed he used an unprescribed asthma inhaler.\n\nIn 2014, South Korean swimmer Kim Ji-heun has tested positive for clenbuterol at an out-of-competition test on May 13, 2014. After completion of proceedings by the Korea Anti-Doping Disciplinary Panel, Kim received a two-year suspension, back-dated to the day of his positive test.\n\nIn 2014, Czech body builder Petr Soukup received a lifetime ban after a positive test for clenbuterol along with methenolone, mesterolone, methamphetamine, oxandrolone, stanozolol, nandrolone, fluoxymesterone, CDMT (\"Oral Turinabol\"), and metandienone.\n\nIn 2015, Yankees minor-league pitching prospect Moises Cedeno tested positive for clenbuterol and was suspended for 72 games.\nIn 2015, two players from the Collingwood Football Club in Australia were delisted from the club and accepted two-year bans from all sport in Australia after testing positive to the substance, which they believe may have been in a contaminated illicit drug they consumed.\n\nIn 2016, Australian heavyweight boxing champion Lucas Browne tested positive for clenbuterol.\n\nIn 2016, Raul A. Mondesi tested positive for clenbuterol and was suspended 50 games from the Northwest Arkansas Naturals. MLB and the MLBPA agreed to reduce the suspension from 80 games to 50 games after Mondesi claimed it was found in cold medicine.\n\nIn 2016, the California State Athletic Commission decided to issue Francisco Vargas a temporary boxing license on a probationary basis after he tested positive for clenbuterol.\n\nIn 2018, British Olympic sprinter Nigel Levine was provisionally suspended for failing a drug test.\n\nIn March 2018, champion boxer Canelo Alvarez tested positive for clenbuterol on two consecutive urine tests in February 2018. This violation led to the cancellation of a heavily anticipated rematch between Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin, which was to be held on May 5, 2018. Alvarez blamed the positive tests on consumption of contaminated meats from Mexico. Notably, some Mexican beef farmers are known to add clenbuterol to cattle feed.\n\nClenbuterol can cause these side effects:\n\nUse over the recommended dose of about 120 μg can cause muscle tremors, headache, dizziness, and gastric irritation. Persons self-administering the drug for weight loss or to improve athletic performance have experienced nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations, tachycardia, and myocardial infarction. Use of the drug may be confirmed by detecting its presence in semen or urine.\n\nClenbuterol is occasionally referred to as \"bute\" and this risks confusion with phenylbutazone, also called \"bute\". Phenylbutazone, which is a drug also used with horses, was tested for in the 2013 European meat adulteration scandal.\n\nIntended to result in leaner meat with a higher muscle-to-fat ratio, the use of clenbuterol has been banned in meat since 1991 in the US and since 1996 in the European Union. The drug is banned due to health concerns about symptoms noted in consumers. These include increased heart rate, muscular tremors, headaches, nausea, fever, and chills. In several cases in Europe, these adverse symptoms have been temporary.\n\nClenbuterol is a growth-promoting drug in the β agonist class of compounds. It is not licensed for use in China, the United States, or the EU for food-producing animals, but some countries have approved it for animals not used for food, and a few countries have approved it for therapeutic uses in food-producing animals.\n\nNot just athletes are affected by contamination. In Portugal, 50 people were reported as affected by clenbuterol in liver and pork between 1998 and 2002, while in 1990, veal liver was suspected of causing clenbuterol poisoning in 22 people in France and 135 people in Spain.\n\nIn September 2006, some 330 people in Shanghai suffered from food poisoning after eating clenbuterol-contaminated pork.\n\nIn February 2009, at least 70 people in one Chinese province (Guangdong) suffered food poisoning after eating pig organs believed to contain clenbuterol residue. The victims complained of stomachaches and diarrhea after eating pig organs bought in local markets.\n\nIn March 2011, China's Ministry of Agriculture said the government would launch a one-year crackdown on illegal additives in pig feed, after a subsidiary of Shuanghui Group, China's largest meat producer, was exposed for using clenbuterol-contaminated pork in its meat products. A total of 72 people in central Henan Province, where Shuanghui is based, were taken into police custody for allegedly producing, selling, or using clenbuterol. The situation has dramatically improved in China since September 2011, when a ban of clenbuterol was announced by China's Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nAuthorities around the world appear to be issuing stricter food safety requirements, such as the Food Safety Modernization Act in the United States, Canada's revision of their import regulations, China's new food laws published since 2009, South Africa's new food law, and many more global changes and restrictions.\n\nThe US and the EU prohibit the use of clenbuterol in food-producing animals. It is, however, for the treatment of allergic respiratory disease in horses, as it is a bronchodilator. It can be used both orally and intravenously. It is also used in cattle to relax the uterus in cows, usually at the time of parturition.\n\n"}

Johnny Cash contributed the title song and soundtrack along with Carl Perkins and Bob Dylan. The title song, \"The Ballad of Little Fauss and Big Halsy\", written by Perkins, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.\n\nThe movie is the story of two motorcycle racers, the inept, unsuspecting Little Fauss (Pollard) and the opportunistic, womanizing Halsy Knox (Redford). Hutton played the role of Rita Nebraska, a role originally offered to Grace Slick.\n\nHalsy Knox, a professional motorcycle racer, runs into Little Fauss, an amateur racer, after a race held near Phoenix, Arizona. They strike up a friendship as Fauss is attracted to Halsy's carefree lifestyle.

He later confirmed the identity of the player as Mohammad Ashraful, the youngest centurion in test cricket.\n\nThe Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) had its first brush with controversy in 2012, before the tournament had even begun. Mashrafe Mortaza, one of Bangladesh's leading fast bowlers and captain of the Dhaka Gladiators, reported to team management that BPL matches could be fixed using a potential spot-fixing approach by a fellow cricketer. According to Gladiators media manager Minhaz Uddin Khan, this information was relayed to the BPL. Furthermore, an ICC ACSU officer was already in Dhaka to examine the situation.\n\nLater, in BPL 2013 additional allegations about match fixing emerged. The alleged match took place on 2 February, between the Dhaka Gladiators and the Chittagong Kings teams. The 28-year-old Ashraful was allegedly paid about one million taka (USD 12,800) to lose the match. However, according to local media, the check he received was returned for insufficient funds.

It was located in a part of Westchester County, New York that was annexed into the Bronx in 1895 and later became known as Morris Park. The racecourse was the site of the Belmont Stakes from 1890 through 1904 as well as the Preakness Stakes in 1890.\n\nMorris Park Racecourse was conceived and built by majority shareholder John Albert Morris as a result of the planned closure of the nearby Jerome Park Racetrack, where racing ended in 1894 to make way for the Jerome Park Reservoir. Principal owner John Morris had extensive business interests in Louisiana and the prominent New York businessman and horseracing enthusiast Leonard W. Jerome served as the racecourse's president. African-American Racing Hall of Fame jockey Isaac Murphy rode on opening day at the new facility—August 20, 1889—and Morris Park was described as \"the finest race track in the world.\" Accessible by horse and buggy, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad added a short spur from its main line near the Van Nest station that brought racing fans directly to the new race track from the greater New York City area.\n\nThe track held the USA Cross Country Championships from 1890 to 1892 and 1897 to 1898.\n\nOn June 10, 1890, Morris Park Racecourse hosted both the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. While the Preakness Stakes was canceled for three years then restarted in 1894 at Gravesend Race Track on Coney Island, the Belmont Stakes was held at Morris Park until it moved to Belmont Park on Long Island in 1905. During this same period of 1890 through 1904, the Champagne Stakes and the Ladies Handicap were also raced here. The Metropolitan Handicap was inaugurated here in 1891 as was the Matron Stakes the following year.\n\nA few days before he died in May 1895, John Morris leased the racecourse, with an option to purchase, to the Westchester Racing Association. Although the 1½ mile racecourse was modified to a one-mile circuit to allow for better spectator viewing, a lack of patronage by high society members meant the clubhouse was usually empty. By 1902, the decline in attendance resulted in the decision to close Morris Park Racecourse.\nThe final day of races was held on October 15, 1904, and racing shifted to the new Belmont Park the following year.\n\nAfter its closure, the Morris Park Racecourse was used for automobile racing but a few years later the Morris heirs sold the property to real estate developers. The new owners ran into financial problems which resulted in the track being taken over by the City of New York in 1907. The city then leased it for two years to the Aeronautic Society of New York who hosted the first public air show on the grounds. In June 1909, Glenn H. Curtiss put on a flying exhibition at Morris Park.\n\nOn April 10, 1910 a fire ravaged much of the stables and nearby facilities. Three years later the property was auctioned off to developers who would subdivide the land into building lots. As late as 1921 the clubhouse was still intact when it was sold as part of a 14-lot package to a company who converted it for use as a factory to manufacture ornamental iron.\n\nMorris Park Racecourse was situated in the area bounded on the south by Sackett Avenue and by what is today the Amtrak Northeast Corridor railroad right-of-way, on the east by Williamsbridge Road, on the west by what is now Bronxdale Road, and on the north by Pelham Parkway. The grandstand stood at the intersection of Bogart and Fowler Avenues and the clubhouse was near the intersection of Fowler and Van Nest Avenues.\n\nThe racetrack covered and had a grandstand long that could accommodate up to 15,000 attendees. The main track had circumference of , with a stretch that was long and widened from at the top of the homestretch to at the finish line. The north end of the track was located on a hill so horses had to run uphill on the backstretch and downhill on the homestretch. A chute on the main track permitted races of to be run with one turn. Another track called the Eclipse course ran diagonally across the main track on a straightaway of , joining the main track at its finish line. It was named after Eclipse, a horse owned by Francis Morris. A six furlongs race on the Eclipse course was nicknamed the \"Toboggan Slide\" and continues to be run today at Aqueduct Racetrack as the Toboggan Handicap. The stables at Morris Park Racecourse held a total of 1,000 stalls, more than any two of the other American racetracks combined.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Official presentation of the project and laying of the first stone was held at the site on 1 October 2008, attended by architect Hermann Tilke and Formula One driver David Coulthard. Hans Geist, who at that time was the managing director of the project, stated that the track could pass an FIA inspection by June 2010, and that even without Formula 1 the project would be profitable staging either DTM or MotoGP. The cost of the project overall was 4.5 billion rub when it opened on 13 July 2012.\n\nMoscow Raceway was designed to be categorized FIA 1T and FIM A, which would allow motorsport competition at any level, from national championships in auto and motorcycle racing, to Formula 1 and MotoGP.

The first race itself was the 5th round of the Formula Renault 3.5 series, which was won by Dutchman Robin Frijns. The first Russian to win a race there soon followed with Daniil Kvyat winning both races of the Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 series round in a row. A total of 10 Russian drivers were at the event including former 3.5 series Champion Mikhail Aleshin; many taking over other drivers for just this event.\n\nOn 21 July 2013, during the World Superbike weekend, Italian rider Andrea Antonelli was killed in the World Supersport race after being hit on the back straight by fellow rider Lorenzo Zanetti. Antonelli was airlifted to hospital where he died of massive head trauma, and the rest of the weekend's action was cancelled due to the torrential downpour that unquestionably contributed to the fatal crash.\n\n"}

Schools and universities look to NOCSAE certification of equipment, particularly helmets, to protect players and reduce liability. NOCSAE data indicate a significant reduction in athlete fatalities and brain injuries when using NOCSAE-certified equipment. NOCSAE has been criticized for stifling innovation, holding a conflict of interest, and not furthering true player safety.\n\nNOCSAE was organized in 1969 with the purpose of reducing death and injuries through the establishment of standards and certification for athletic equipment. It does this through researching and testing equipment, developing new standards, and improving existing ones. \n\nNOCSAE's commissioning came in the wake of the death of 32 players in organized football in 1968 and subsequent concerns over safety of athletic equipment. Based on its limited funding, NOCSAE has narrowed its efforts from protective athletic equipment in all sports toward helmets' effectiveness in reducing injury, particularly in football, lacrosse, and baseball.\n\nAs a general matter, to be approved by NOCSAE, helmets must resist brain-injuring, concussive forces. Research from NOCSAE, in addition to targeting helmet safety standards, has also increased understanding of the mechanisms of head and neck injuries and the design and structure of helmets, headgear, and face masks.\n\nNOCSAE standards are adopted, if at all, on a voluntary basis. While a sport governing body may mandate that a piece of equipment be \"NOCSAE approved\", that is a rule or mandate of the governing body, not NOCSAE.\n\nBy 1973, NOCSAE had finalized and published a standard testing criteria for football helmets. The NCAA began advising its members to purchase helmets certified by NOCSAE beginning in 1975. NOCSAE helmet standards were required in colleges in 1978 and in high schools in 1980.\n\nStickers indicating NOCSAE certification are placed onto helmets. Attorneys specializing in sports law advise schools and universities to purchase appropriate athletic equipment for the athletic activities offered that is of satisfactory quality, specifically football helmets that adhere to NOCSAE guidelines. School athletic staff are advised by experts to search for NOCSAE certification stickers, both as part of their athletic training education and day-to-day activities . They are warned to do this, in particular, for liability reasons, as \"serious legal reprecussions may occur if a helmet is issued to a student athletic \" lacking an approval sticker.\n\nNOCSAE reports that by 1985, the number of head injury fatalities had fallen significantly, with zero deaths in 1990, the first season with no deaths since reporting began in 1931. It also claims that the incidence of serious head injuries had fallen from 4.25 players per 100,000 in the late 1960s to 0.68 players per 100,000 in the late 1980s.\n\nThe voting members of the NOCSAE board consists of representatives selected by their professional organizations, including:\n\nand a non-voting representative from each the National Collegiate Athletic Association and\nthe National Federation of State High School Associations.\n\nCritics note that NOCSAE has \"a close working relationship with\" the sporting goods industry, and that because NOCSAE is funded by those few companies, it has \"an inherent conflict of interest\". They also claim that NOCSAE is not effective at lessening concussions and improving safety. U.S. Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico requested that a federal agency, the Consumer Products Safety Commission, assume an official role in helmet safety testing and certification, effectively displacing NOCSAE. \n\nNOCSAE's certification standards have been criticized for authorizing helmet models that are \"archaic or did not score well on specific impact tests.\" In addition, NOCSAE's tests focus on preventing catastrophic injuries like skull fractures, not concussions. Observers note that such testing is equivalent to judging a car's safety based on its seat belts, with no consideration given to air bags.\n\nThe sole reliance of the NFL on NOCSAE certification, without considering the tested safety results and other data on helmet models, has been criticized by the players' union.\n\nCritics note that while NOCSAE standards call for equipment to be reconditioned, where possible, and recertified every year, a school may keep its helmets as NOCSAE-certified simply by never submitting them for re-certification.\n\nThe inflexible nature of NOCSAE guidelines, stemming from the hesitance of helmet manufacturers to take any risks that could lead to lawsuits, leads some to argue that innovative helmet designs may be underdeveloped.\n"}

{"id": "63059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63059", "title": "Slugging percentage", "text": "Slugging percentage\n\nIn baseball statistics, slugging percentage (SLG) is a measure of the batting productivity of a hitter. It is calculated as total bases divided by at bats, through the following formula, where \"AB\" is the number of at bats for a given player, and \"1B\", \"2B\", \"3B\", and \"HR\" are the number of singles, doubles, triples, and home runs, respectively: \n\nUnlike batting average, slugging percentage gives more weight to extra-base hits such as doubles and home runs, relative to singles. Walks are specifically excluded from this calculation, as a plate appearance that ends in a walk is not counted as an at bat.\n\nThe name is a misnomer, as the statistic is not a percentage but a scale of measure whose computed value is a number from 0 to 4. The statistic gives a double twice the value of a single, a triple three times the value, and a homerun four times.\n\nA slugging percentage is always expressed as a decimal to three decimal places, and is generally spoken as if multiplied by 1000. For example, a slugging percentage of .589 would be spoken as \"five eighty nine.\"\n\nIn 2016, the mean average SLG among all batters in Major League Baseball was .417.\n\nFor example, in 1920, Babe Ruth played his first season for the New York Yankees. In 458 at bats, Ruth had 172 hits, comprising 73 singles, 36 doubles, 9 triples, and 54 home runs, which brings the total base count to . His total number of bases (388) divided by his total at-bats (458) is .847 which constitutes his slugging percentage for the season. This also set a record for Ruth which stood until 2001 when Barry Bonds achieved 411 bases in 476 at-bats bringing his slugging percentage to .863, which has been unmatched since.\n\nLong after it was first invented, slugging percentage gained new significance when baseball analysts realized that it combined with on-base percentage (OBP) to form a very good measure of a player's overall offensive production (in fact, OBP + SLG was originally referred to as \"production\" by baseball writer and statistician Bill James). A predecessor metric was developed by Branch Rickey in 1954. Rickey, in \"Life\" magazine, suggested that combining OBP with what he called \"extra base power\" (EBP) would give a better indicator of player performance than typical Triple Crown stats. EBP was a predecessor to slugging percentage.\n\nAllen Barra and George Ignatin were early adopters in combining the two modern-day statistics, multiplying them together to form what is now known as \"SLOB\" (Slugging × On-Base). Bill James applied this principle to his runs created formula several years later (and perhaps independently), essentially multiplying SLOB × At-Bats to create the formula:\n\nIn 1984, Pete Palmer and John Thorn developed perhaps the most widespread means of combining slugging and on-base percentage: On-base plus slugging (OPS), which is a simple addition of the two values. Because it is easy to calculate, OPS has been used with increased frequency in recent years as a shorthand form to evaluate contributions as a batter.\n\nIn a 2015 article, Bryan Grosnick made the point that \"on base\" and \"slugging\" may not be comparable enough to be simply added together. \"On base\" has a theoretical maximum of 1.000 whereas \"slugging\" has a theoretical maximum of 4.000. The actual numbers don't show as big a difference of course, with Grosnick listing .350 as a good \"on base\" and .430 as a good \"slugging.\" He goes on to say that OPS has the advantages of simplicity and availability and further states, \"you'll probably get it 75% right, at least.\"\n\nThe maximum numerically possible slugging percentage is 4.000. A number of MLB players (117 through the end of the 2016 season) have momentarily had a 4.000 career slugging percentage by homering in their first major league at-bat. Hundreds of other players have momentarily held a 4.000 percentage for a season by hitting a home run in their first at-bat of the season. \n\nNo player has ever retired with a 4.000 slugging percentage, but four players tripled in their only MLB at-bat and therefore share the record of a career slugging percentage of 3.000 (when evaluated without regard to a minimum number of games played or plate appearances). The players are Eric Cammack (2000 Mets), Scott Munninghoff (1980 Phillies), Eduardo Rodríguez (1973 Brewers), and Charlie Lindstrom (1958 White Sox).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27378", "title": "Snooker", "text": "Snooker\n\nSnooker (, ) is a cue sport which originated among British Army officers stationed in India in the later half of the 19th century. It is played on a rectangular table covered with a green cloth, or baize, with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Using a cue and 22 coloured balls, players must strike the white ball (or \"cue ball\") to the remaining balls in the correct sequence, accumulating points for each pot. An individual game, or frame, is won by the player who scores the most points. A match is won when a player wins a predetermined number of frames.\n\nSnooker gained its own identity in 1884 when army officer Sir Neville Chamberlain (not the Prime Minister of that name), while stationed in Ooty, devised a set of rules that combined pyramid and life pool. The word \"snooker\" was a long-used military term used to describe inexperienced or first-year personnel. The game grew in popularity in England, and the Billiards Association and Control Club was formed in 1919. It is now governed by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA).\n\nThe World Snooker Championship has taken place since 1927, with Joe Davis becoming a key figure in the early growth of the sport with 15 championship wins from 1927 to 1946. The modern era began in 1969 after the BBC commissioned the snooker television show \"Pot Black\" and began to air the World Championship in 1978, leading to the sport's new peak in popularity. Ray Reardon dominated the game in the 1970s, Steve Davis in the 1980s, and Stephen Hendry in the 1990s; Ronnie O'Sullivan has won the most world titles since 2000.\n\nTop professional players now compete regularly around the world and earn millions of pounds. The sport has become increasingly popular in China.\n\nThe origin of snooker dates back to the latter half of the 19th century. In the 1870s, billiards was a popular activity amongst British Army officers stationed in India and several variations of the game were devised during this time. One such variation originated at the officers' mess of the 11th Devonshire Regiment in 1875, which combined the rules of two pocket billiards games, pyramid and life pool. The former was played with fifteen red balls and one black positioned in a triangle, while the latter involved the potting of designated coloured balls. The game developed its own identity in 1884 when its first set of rules was finalised by Sir Neville Chamberlain, an English officer who helped develop and popularise the game at Stone House in Ooty on a table built by Burroughes & Watts that was brought over by boat. \n\nThe word \"snooker\" was a slang term for first-year cadets and inexperienced military personnel, but Chamberlain would often use it to describe the inept performance of one of his fellow officers at the table. The name instantly stuck with the players. In 1887, snooker was given its first definite reference in England in a copy of \"Sporting Life\" which caused a growth in popularity. Chamberlain came out as the game's inventor in a letter to \"The Field\" published on 19 March 1938, 63 years after the fact.\n\nSnooker grew in popularity across the Indian colonies and the United Kingdom, but it remained a game mainly for the gentry, and many gentlemen's clubs that had a billiards table would not allow non-members inside to play. To accommodate the growing interest, smaller and more open snooker-specific clubs were formed. In 1919, the Billiards Association and the Billiards Control Board merged to form the Billiards Association and Control Club (BA&CC) and a new, standard set of rules for snooker first became official.\n\nThe game of snooker grew in the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, and by 1927 the first World Snooker Championship had been organised by Joe Davis who, as a professional English billiards and snooker player, moved the game from a pastime activity into a more professional sphere. Davis won every world championship until 1946 when he retired. The game went into a decline through the 1950s and 1960s with little interest generated outside of those who played. In 1959, Davis introduced a variation of the game known as \"snooker plus\" (see the \"Variations\" section below) to try to improve the game's popularity by adding two extra colours, but it never caught on.\n\nA major advance occurred in 1969, when David Attenborough commissioned the snooker television series \"Pot Black\" to demonstrate the potential of colour television with the green table and multi-coloured balls being ideal for showing off the advantages of colour broadcasting. The series became a ratings success and was for a time the second-most popular show on BBC Two. Interest in the game increased and the 1978 World Snooker Championship was the first to be fully televised. The game quickly became a mainstream game in the UK, Ireland and much of the Commonwealth and has enjoyed much success since the late 1970s, with most of the ranking tournaments being televised. In 1985 a total of 18.5 million viewers watched the concluding frame of the world championship final between Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis. The loss of tobacco sponsorship during the 2000s led to a decrease in the number of professional tournaments, although some new sponsors were sourced; and the popularity of the game in Asia with emerging talents such as Liang Wenbo and more established players such as Ding Junhui and Marco Fu, boosted the sport in the Far East. By 2007, the BBC dedicated 400 hours to snooker coverage compared to just 14 minutes forty years earlier.\n\nIn 2010, promoter Barry Hearn gained a controlling interest in World Snooker Ltd., the professional sport's commercial arm, pledging to revitalise the \"moribund\" professional game. Under his direction, the number of professional tournaments has increased, certain tournament formats have been changed in an attempt to increase their appeal, and, by 2013, total prize money had more than doubled from £3 million to more than £7 million.\n\nThe objective of the game is to score more than one's opponent by potting in the correct order. At the start of a frame, the balls are positioned as shown, and the players then take turns to hit shots by striking the cue ball with the of the cue, their aim being to pot one of the red balls into a pocket and thereby score a point, or, if this is not possible, to at least hit a red ball so as to avoid making a foul shot. If the striker pots a red ball, he or she must then pot one of the six \"colours\" (in snooker, the term \"colour\" is understood to exclude the red balls). If the player successfully pots a colour, the value of that ball is added to the player's score, and the ball is returned to its starting position on the table. After that, the player must pot another red ball, then another colour, and so on. This process continues until the striker fails to pot the desired ball, at which point the opponent comes to the table to play the next shot.\n\nThe game continues in this manner until all the reds are potted and only the six colours are left on the table. At this point the colours must be potted in the order from least to most valuable ball – that is, yellow first (two points), then green (three points), brown (four points), blue (five points), pink (six points) and finally black (seven points), the balls not being returned to play. When the final ball is potted, the player with more points wins. If the scores are equal when all the balls have been potted, the black is placed back on its spot as a tiebreaker. A player may also concede a frame while on strike if he or she thinks there are not enough points available on the table to beat the opponent's score. In professional snooker this is a common occurrence.\n\nPoints may also be scored in a game when a player's opponent . A foul can occur for various reasons, most commonly for failing to hit the correct ball (e.g. hitting a colour first when the player was attempting to hit a red), or for sending the cue ball into a pocket. The former may occur when the player fails to escape from \"\" – a situation in which the previous player leaves the cue ball positioned such that no legal ball can be struck directly without obstruction by an illegal ball. Points gained from a foul vary from a minimum of four, to a maximum of seven if the black ball is involved.\n\nThe total number of consecutive points (excluding fouls) that a player amasses during one to the table is known as a \"\". A player attaining a break of 15, for example, could have reached it by potting a red then a black, then a red then a pink, before failing to pot the next red. The traditional maximum break in snooker is achieved by potting all reds with blacks then all colours, yielding 147 points; this is often known as a \"147\" or a \"maximum\". The highest possible break is a 155 break, also known as a \"super maximum\". This is achieved via the opponent leaving a , with the black being potted as the additional colour, and then potting 15 reds and blacks with the colours. Jamie Cope has the distinction of being the first player in snooker history to post a verified 155 break, achieved in a practice frame in 2005.\n\nOne , from the balls in their starting position until the last ball is potted, is called a \"\". A generally consists of a predetermined number of frames and the player who wins the most frames wins the match. Most professional matches require a player to win five frames, and are called \"best of nine\" as that is the maximum possible number of frames. Tournament finals are usually best of 17 or best of 19, while the world championship uses longer matches – ranging from best of 19 in the qualifiers and the first round proper, up to 35 frames in length (first to 18), and is played over two days, extended if necessary until a winner is determined.\n\nProfessional and competitive amateur matches are officiated by a referee who is the sole judge of fair play. The referee also replaces the colours on the table when necessary and calls out how many points the player has scored during a break. Professional players usually play the game in a sporting manner, declaring fouls the referee has missed, acknowledging good shots from their opponent, or holding up a hand to apologise for fortunate shots, also known as \"flukes\".\n\nAccessories used for snooker include for the tip of the cue, of various sorts (needed often, due to the length of a full-size table), a triangle to the reds, and a scoreboard. One drawback of snooker on a full-size (12 ft × 6 ft) table is the size of the room (), which is the minimum required for comfortable cueing room on all sides. This limits the number of locations in which the game can easily be played. While pool tables are common to many pubs, snooker tends to be played either in private surroundings or in public snooker halls. The game can also be played on smaller tables using fewer red balls. The variants in table size are: 10 ft × 5 ft, 9 ft × 4.5 ft, 8 ft × 4 ft, 6 ft × 3 ft (the smallest for realistic play) and 4 ft × 2 ft. Smaller tables can come in a variety of styles, such as fold-away or dining-table convertible.\n\nA traditional snooker scoreboard resembles an abacus, and records units, tens and hundreds via horizontal sliding pointers. They are typically attached to a wall by the snooker table. A simple scoring bead is also sometimes used, called a \"scoring string\", or \"scoring wire\". Each bead (segment of the string) represents a single point. Snooker players typically move one or several beads with their cue.\n\nThe World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA, also known as World Snooker), founded in 1968 as the Professional Billiard Players' Association, is the governing body for the professional game. The amateur game (including youth competition) is governed by the International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF).\n\nProfessional snooker players can play on the World Snooker main tour ranking circuit. Ranking points, earned by players through their performances over the previous two seasons, determine the current world rankings. A player's ranking determines what level of qualification he or she requires for ranking tournaments. The elite of professional snooker are generally regarded as the \"top 16\" ranking players, who are not required to pre-qualify for three of the tournaments, namely the Shanghai Masters, Australian Open and the World Snooker Championship. The tour contains 96 players – the top 64 from the previous two seasons, the 8 highest-ranked professional players on the Players Tour Championship Order of Merit who are not in the top 64, 12 players from the Q School, and various regional, junior and amateur champions.\nThe most important event in professional snooker is the world championship, held annually since 1927 (except during World War II and between 1958 and 1963). The tournament has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, since 1977, and was sponsored by Embassy from 1976 to 2005. Since 2005, tobacco companies have not been allowed to sponsor sporting events in the United Kingdom, and the world championship has had to find a new sponsor. It was announced in January 2006 that the 2006–2010 world championships would be sponsored by online casino 888.com. The championship is currently sponsored by Betfred.com after 888.com pulled out of their five-year sponsorship deal after three years.\nOn 15 April 2009 the World Snooker Championship website announced that Betfred.com would be the new sponsor of the world championship for the next four years.\n\nThe world championship is the most highly valued prize in professional snooker, both in terms of financial reward (£300,000 for the winner, formerly £250,000) as well as ranking points and prestige. The world championship is televised extensively in the UK by the BBC and gains significant coverage in Europe on Eurosport and in the Far East.\n\nThe group of tournaments that come next in importance are the other ranking tournaments. Players in these tournaments score world ranking points. A high ranking ensures qualification for the next year's tournaments, opportunities to play in invitational tournaments and an advantageous draw in tournaments. The most prestigious of these, after the world championship, is the UK Championship. Third in line are the invitational tournaments, to which most of the highest ranked players are invited. The most important tournament in this category is the Masters, which to most players is the second or third most sought-after prize.\n\nIn an attempt to answer criticisms that televised matches can be slow or get bogged down in lengthy safety exchanges and that long matches cause problems for advertisers, an alternative series of timed tournaments has been organised by Matchroom Sport chairman Barry Hearn. The shot-timed Premier League Snooker was established, with seven players invited to compete at regular United Kingdom venues, televised on Sky Sports. Players had twenty-five seconds to take each shot, with five time-outs per player per match. While some success was achieved with this format, it generally did not receive the same amount of press attention or status as the regular ranking tournaments. However, this event has been taken out of the tour since 2013, when the Champion of Champions was established.\n\nThere are also other tournaments that have less importance, earn no world ranking points and are not televised. These can change on a year-to-year basis depending on calendars and sponsors.\n\nIn 2015, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association submitted an unsuccessful bid for snooker to be played at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Another bid has been put forward for Paris 2024 through the newly formed World Snooker Federation.\n\nSeveral players, such as Ronnie O'Sullivan, Mark Allen and Steve Davis, have warned that there are so many tournaments that players risk burning out. In 2012, O'Sullivan played fewer tournaments in order to spend more time with his children, and ended the 2012–13 season ranked No. 19 in the world. Furthermore, he did not play any tournament in 2013 except the world championship, which he won.\n\n\nIn the professional era that began with Joe Davis in the 1930s and continues until the present day, a relatively small number of players have succeeded at the top level.\n\nThrough the decades, certain players have tended to dominate the game, but none more than its original star player, Joe Davis. Davis was world champion for twenty years, retiring unbeaten after claiming his fifteenth world title in 1946 when the tournament was reinstated after the Second World War. Davis was unbeaten in world championship play, and was only ever beaten four times in his entire life, with all four defeats coming after his world championship retirement and inflicted by his own brother Fred. He did lose matches in handicapped tournaments, but on level terms these four defeats were the only losses of his entire career. He was also world billiards champion. It is regarded as highly unlikely that anyone will ever dominate the game to his level again.\nAfter Davis retired from world championship play, the next dominant force was his younger brother Fred Davis who had lost the 1940 final by a single frame. By 1947 he was deemed ready by his brother to take over the mantle but lost the world final to the Scotsman Walter Donaldson. After this setback, Davis and Donaldson contested the next four finals, Davis proving the stronger player. After the abandonment of the world championship in 1953, with the 1952 final boycotted by British professionals, the Professional Match Play Championship became the unofficial world championship in all but name. Fred Davis won the event every year until its penultimate one, when in 1957 he did not enter.\nAfter winning three official and five unofficial world titles, his absence from the 1957 tournament was to prove vital, as its winner, John Pulman, was automatically awarded the official world title on resumption of the tournament in 1964. Davis would try, but never regain the world title again.\n\nJohn Pulman was the king of the 1960s, when the world championship was played on a challenge basis. However, when the tournament reverted to a knockout formula in 1969, he did not prosper. Ray Reardon became the dominant force in the 1970s, winning six titles, with John Spencer winning three.\nSteve Davis' first world title in 1981 made him only the 11th world champion since 1927, including the winner of the boycotted 1952 title, Horace Lindrum. Stephen Hendry became the 14th in 1990 and dominated through the 1990s. Reardon won six (1970, 1973–1976 and 1978), Davis also six (1981, 1983, 1984 and 1987–1989) and Hendry seven (1990, 1992–1996 and 1999). Ronnie O'Sullivan is the closest to dominance in the modern era, having won the title on five occasions in the 21st century (2001, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2013). Mark Williams has won three times (2000, 2003, and 2018) and John Higgins four times (1998, 2007, 2009, 2011) but since the beginning of the century, there has not been a dominant force like in previous decades, and the modern era has seen many players playing to a similar standard, instead of one player raising the bar. Davis, for example, won more ranking tournaments than the rest of the top 64 players put together by 1985. By retaining his title in 2013, O'Sullivan became the first player to successfully defend the world championship since 1996 when Hendry won the sixth of his seven titles, his fifth in a row, and then later by Mark Selby in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "96908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=96908", "title": "Title IX", "text": "Title IX\n\nTitle IX is a federal civil rights law in the United States of America that was passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972. This is Public Law No. 92‑318, 86 Stat. 235 (June 23, 1972), codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681–1688. It was co-authored and introduced by Senator Birch Bayh in the U.S. Senate, and Congresswoman Patsy Mink in the House. It was later renamed the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act following Mink's death in 2002. The following is the original text as written and signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1972:\n\nTitle IX was enacted as a follow-up to passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The 1964 Act was passed to end discrimination in various fields based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in the areas of employment and public accommodation. The 1964 Act did not prohibit sex discrimination against persons employed at educational institutions. A parallel law, Title VI, had also been enacted in 1964 to prohibit discrimination in federally funded private and public entities. It covered race, color, and national origin but excluded sex. Feminists during the early 1970s lobbied Congress to add sex as a protected class category. Title IX was enacted to fill this gap and prohibit discrimination in all federally funded education programs. Congressman John Tower then proposed an amendment to Title IX that would have exempted athletics departments from the scope of Title IX's coverage. \n\nThe Tower amendment was rejected, but it led to widespread misunderstanding of Title IX as a sports-equity law, rather than an anti-discrimination, civil rights law. While Title IX is best known for its impact on high school and collegiate athletics, the original statute made no explicit mention of sports. The United States Supreme Court also issued decisions in the 1980s and 1990s, making clear that sexual harassment and assault is a form of sex discrimination. In 2011, President Barack Obama issued guidance reminding schools of their obligation to redress sexual assaults as civil rights matters under Title IX. Obama also issued guidance clarifying Title IX protections for LGBT students through Dear Colleague letters.\n\nThe precursor to Title IX was an executive order, issued in 1967 by President Lyndon Johnson, forbidding discrimination in federal contracts. Before these orders were issued, the National Organization for Women (NOW) had persuaded him through successful lobbying, or influencing, his personal aides or Members of Congress to include the addition of women. Executive Order 11375 required all entities receiving federal contracts to end discrimination on the basis of sex in hiring and employment. In 1969, a notable example of its success was Bernice Sandler who used the executive order to retain her job and tenure at the University of Maryland. She utilized university statistics to show how female employment at the University had plummeted as qualified women were replaced by men. Sandler then brought her complaints to the Department of Labor's Office for Federal Fair Contracts Compliance, where she was encouraged to file a formal complaint; later citing inequalities in pay, rank, and admissions, among others. \n\nSandler soon began to file complaints against the University of Maryland and against other colleges while working with NOW and the Women's Equity Action League (WEAL). Sandler later filed two hundred and sixty-nine (269) complaints against colleges and universities, which led to the events of 1970. In 1970, Sandler joined U.S. House Representative Edith Green's Subcommittee on Higher Education of the Education and Labor Committee, and observed corresponding congressional hearings relating to women's issues on employment and equal opportunity. In these hearings, Green and Sandler initially proposed the idea of Title IX. An early legislative draft was then authored by Representative Patsy Mink with the assistance of Representative Edith Green. At the hearing, there were mentions of athletics. The idea behind the draft was a progressive one in somewhat instituting an affirmative action for women in all aspects of American education.\n\nMink's initial draft of Title IX was formally introduced in Congress by Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana in 1971 who then was its chief Senate sponsor with respect to congressional debate. At the time, Bayh was working on numerous constitutional issues related to women's employment and sex discrimination—including but not limited to the revised draft of the Equal Rights Amendment. The ERA attempted to build \"a powerful constitutional base from which to move forward in abolishing discriminatory differential treatment based on sex\". As he was having partisan difficulty in later getting the ERA Amendment out of committee, the Higher Education Act of 1965 was on the Senate Floor for re-authorization; and on 28 February 1972, Bayh re-introduced a provision found in the original/revised ERA bill as an amendment which would become Title IX. In his remarks on the Senate Floor, Bayh stated, \"we are all familiar with the stereotype [that] women [are] pretty things who go to college to find a husband, [and who] go on to graduate school because they want a more interesting husband, and finally marry, have children, and never work again. \n\nThe desire of many schools not to waste a 'man's place' on a woman stems from such stereotyped notions. But the facts absolutely contradict these myths about the 'weaker sex' and it is time to change our operating assumptions.\" He continued: \"While the impact of this amendment would be far-reaching, it is not a panacea. It is, however, an important first step in the effort to provide for the women of America something that is rightfully theirs—an equal chance to attend the schools of their choice, to develop the skills they want, and to apply those skills with the knowledge that they will have a fair chance to secure the jobs of their choice with equal pay for equal work\". Title IX became public law on 23 June 1972. When U.S. President Nixon signed the bill, he spoke mostly about desegregation busing, and did not mention the expansion of educational access for women he had enacted.\n\nTitle IX's statutory language is brief. U.S. President Nixon therefore directed the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to carry publish regulations clarifying the law's application. In 1974, U.S. Senator John Tower introduced the Tower Amendment which would have exempted revenue-producing sports from Title IX compliance. Later that year, Congress rejected the Tower Amendment and passed an amendment proposed by U.S. Senator Jacob Javits directly HEW to include \"reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports\" adopted in its place. In June 1975, HEW published the final regulations detailing how Title IX would be enforced. These regulations were codified in the Federal Register in the Code of Federal Regulations Volume 34, Part 106 ( 34 C.F.R. 106 34 C.F.R. 106). Since 1975, the federal government has issued guidance clarifying how it interprets and enforces those regulations. \n\nThe Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 is tied to Title IX which was passed in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1984 ruling \"Grove City College v. Bell.\" The Court held that Title IX applied only to those programs receiving direct federal aid. This case was initially reached by the Supreme Court when Grove City College disagreed with the Department of Education's assertion that it was required to comply with Title IX. Grove City College was not a federally funded institution; however, they did accept students who were receiving Basic Educational Opportunity Grants through a Department of Education program. The Department of Education's stance was that because some of its students were receiving federal grants, the school was thus receiving federal assistance and Title IX applied to it. The Court decided that since Grove City College was only receiving federal funding through the grant program that only this program had to be in compliance. This ruling was a major victory for those opposed to Title IX as it then made many athletic programs outside the purview of Title IX, and thus reduced its scope. \n\nGrove City's victory, however, was short-lived. The Civil Rights Restoration Act successfully passed in 1988, which extended Title IX coverage to all programs of any educational institution that receives \"any\" federal assistance, both direct and indirect. In 1994, the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, sponsored by Congresswoman Cardiss Collins required that federally-assisted educational institutions disclose information on roster sizes for men's and women's athletic teams; as well as budgets for recruiting, scholarships, coaches' salaries, and other expenses, annually. In October 2002, less than a month after the death of U.S. Rep. Patsy Mink, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution to rename Title IX the \"Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act,\" which President George W. Bush signed into law. On November 24, 2006, Title IX regulations were amended to provide greater flexibility in the operation of single-sex classes or extracurricular activities at the primary or secondary school level; this was largely to introduce federal abstinence-only programs, which may have been a partial basis for the support of President Bush.\n\nThough views differ as respects the impact of Title IX, discussion typically focuses on whether or not Title IX has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females, and whether and to what extent Title IX has resulted in decreased athletic opportunities for males. In addition, the legislation had impacts on aspects other than athletes. The increased exposure of female sports led to increased dominance by males of the governance of female athletics. For example, the male-dominated NCAA, which had been content to let the female-dominated AIAW run female championships, decided to offer female championships, leading to the eventual demise of the AIAW.\n\nAdvocates of Title IX's current interpretation cite increases in female athletic participation, and attribute those increases to Title IX. One study, completed in 2006, pointed to a large increase in the number of women participating in athletics at both the high school and college level. The number of women in high school sports had increased by a factor of nine, while the number of women in college sports had increased by more than 450%. A 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women's collegiate sports have grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school. The five most frequently offered college sports for women are, in order: (1) Basketball, 98.8% of schools have a team; (2) Volleyball, 95.7%; (3) Soccer, 92.0%; (4) Cross Country; 90.8%, and (5) Softball; 89.2%.\n\nAt the same time, many contend that the current interpretation of Title IX by the OCR has resulted in the dismantling of men's programs, despite strong participation in those sports. For example, though interest in the sport of wrestling has consistently increased at the high school level since 1990, scores of colleges have dropped their wrestling programs during that same period. The OCR's three-prong test for compliance with Title IX often is cited as the reason for these cuts. Wrestling historically was the most frequently dropped sport, but other men's sports later overtook the lead, such that according to the NCAA, the most-dropped men's sports between 1987 and 2002 were as follows: Cross country (183), indoor track (180), golf (178), tennis (171), rowing (132), outdoor track (126), swimming (125) and wrestling (121).\n\nSome believe that the increase in athletic opportunity for girls in high school has come at the expense of boys' athletics. For example, the College Sports Council has stated, \"Nationwide, there are currently 1.3 million more boys participating in high school sports than girls. Using a gender quota to enforce Title IX in high school sports would put those young athletes at risk of losing their opportunity to play.\" High school participation rates from the National Federation of High School associations report that in 2010–11, there were 4,494,406 boys and 3,173,549 girls participating in high school athletics.\n\nThere have been different interpretations regarding Title IX's application to high school athletics. The American Sports Council sued the Department of Education in 2011 seeking a declaratory judgment that its policy interpreting Title IX's requirement for equity in participation opportunities is limited to colleges and universities. The American Sports Council argued that \"The three-part test and its encouragement of quotas, has no relevance to high schools or high-school sports, and no federal regulation or interpretation has ever said that high schools must abide by the three-part test\". On the other hand, the Department of Education insists that Title IX is a \"valuable tool\" for ensuring a level playing field for all students\" and \"plays a critical role in ensuring a fundamental level of fairness in America's schools and universities\".\n\nBetween 1981 and 1999 university athletic departments cut 171 men's wrestling teams, 84 men's tennis teams, 56 men's gymnastics teams, 27 men's track teams, and 25 men's swimming teams. While some teams—both men's and women's—have been eliminated in the Title IX era, both sexes have seen a net increase in the number of athletic periods over a similar time period as the above quote, and by studies including more recent data, though when total enrollment which had likewise increased is controlled for, only women had an increase in participation.\n\nBecause teams vary widely in size, it is more appropriate to compare the number of total participation opportunities. Additionally, the total number of college participation opportunities has increased for both sexes in the Title IX era, though solely for women when increased enrollment is accounted for, as men's participation remained static relative to university enrollment, and men's opportunities outnumber women's by a wide margin.\n\nThe Women's Sports Foundation reported in a 2007 study of athletic opportunities at NCAA institutions that over 150,000 female athletic opportunities would need to be added in order to reach participation levels proportional to the female undergraduate population. The same study found that men's athletics also receives the lion's share of athletic department budgets for operating expenses, recruiting, scholarships, and coaches salaries.\n\nTitle IX applies to all educational programs and all aspects of a school's educational system. In the 1990s, the U.S. Supreme Court issued three decisions clarifying that Title IX requires schools to respond appropriately to reports of sexual harassment and sexual violence against students. Civil rights activists and organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) likewise maintain that \"when students suffer sexual assault and harassment, they are deprived of equal and free access to an education.\" Further, according to an April 2011 letter issued by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, \"The sexual harassment of students, including sexual violence, interferes with students' right to receive an education free from discrimination and, in the case of sexual violence, is a crime.\"\n\nThe letter, named the Dear Colleague Letter, states that it is the responsibility of institutions of higher education \"to take immediate and effective steps to end sexual harassment and sexual violence.\" The letter illustrates multiple examples of Title IX requirements as they relate to sexual violence, and makes clear that, should an institution fail to fulfill its responsibilities under Title IX, the Department of Education can impose a fine and potentially deny further institutional access to federal funds.\n\nOn March 15, 2011, Yale undergraduate student and alleged sexual violence survivor Alexandra Brodsky filed a Title IX complaint along with fifteen fellow students alleging Yale \"has a sexually hostile environment and has failed to adequately respond to sexual harassment concerns.\"\n\nIn October 2012, an Amherst College student, Angie Epifano, wrote an explicit, personal account of her alleged sexual assault and the ensuing \"appalling treatment\" she received when coming forward to seek support from the College's administration. In the narrative, Epifano alleged that she was raped by a fellow Amherst student and described how her life was affected by the experience; she stated that the perpetrator harassed her at the only dining hall, that her academic performance was negatively affected, and that, when she sought support, the administration coerced her into taking the blame for her experience and ultimately institutionalized her and pressured her to drop out.\n\nThe fact that such a prestigious institution could have such a noxious interior fills me with intense remorse mixed with sour distaste. I am sickened by the Administration's attempts to cover up survivors' stories, cook their books to discount rapes, pretend that withdrawals never occur, quell attempts at change, and sweep sexual assaults under a rug. When politicians cover up affairs or scandals the masses often rise up in angry protestations and call for a more transparent government. What is the difference between a government and the Amherst College campus? Why can't we know what is really happening on campus? Why should we be quiet about sexual assault?\"\n\nWhen the Amherst case reached national attention, Annie E. Clark and Andrea Pino, two women who were allegedly sexually assaulted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill connected with Amherst student, Dana Bolger, and Brodsky to address the parallel concerns of hostility at their institution, filing Title IX and Clery Act complaints against the university on January 2013, both leading to investigations by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nFollowing the national prominence of the UNC Chapel Hill case, organizers Pino and Clark went on to coordinate with students at other schools; in 2013, complaints citing violations of Title IX were filed by Occidental College (on April 18), Swarthmore College and the University of Southern California (on May 22). These complaints, the resulting campaigns against sexual violence on college campuses, and the organizing of Bolger, Brodsky, Clark, Pino and other activists led to the formation of an informal national network of activists. Bolger and Brodsky also started Know Your IX, an organization of student activists focused on legal education and federal and state policy change.\n\nIn addition to its use within formal complaints submitted to the Department of Education, Title IX has been utilized in civil litigation. In 2006, a federal court found that there was sufficient evidence that the University of Colorado acted with \"deliberate indifference\" toward students Lisa Simpson and Anne Gilmore, who were sexually assaulted by student football players. The university settled the case, promising to change its policies and pay $2.5 million in damages. In 2008, Arizona State University was the subject of a lawsuit that alleged violations of rights guaranteed by Title IX: the university expelled a football player for multiple instances of severe sexual harassment, but readmitted him; he went on to rape a fellow student in her dorm room. Despite its claim that it bore no responsibility, the school settled the lawsuit, agreeing to revise and improve its official response to sexual misconduct and to pay the plaintiff $850,000 in damages and fees.\n\nThe Trump administration has made changes to guidelines that were implemented during the Obama administration. These changes shift the determination of sexual assault from \"preponderance of the evidence\" to a \"clear and convincing\" evidence standard, which is typically used for civil cases in which serious allegations are made (as opposed to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases). On September 22, 2017, US Secretary of Education Secretary Betsy Devos rescinded the Obama-era guidelines which had prodded colleges and universities to more aggressively investigate campus sexual assaults.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2016, under the Obama administration the U.S. Department of Education issued guidance explaining that transgender students are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX. It instructed public schools to treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity in academic life. A student who identifies as a transgender boy, for instance, is allowed entry to a boys-only class, and a student who identifies as a transgender girl is allowed entry to a girls-only class. This also applies to academic records if that student is over the age of eighteen at a university. The memo states in part that \"[a]ll students, including transgender students, or students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX. Under Title IX, a recipient generally must treat transgender, or gender non-conforming, consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of the planning, implementation, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of single-sex classes.\"\n\nHowever, starting in 2017 with the Trump administration, several of these policies have been rolled back. In February 2017, the Departments of Justice and Education withdrew the guidance on gender identity. The Education Department headed by Betsy DeVos announced on 12 February 2018 that Title IX did not allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their gender identities.\n\nIn October 2018, \"The New York Times\" obtained a memo issued by the Department of Health and Human Services that would propose a strict definition of gender for Title IX, using the person's sex as determined at birth and could not be changed, effectively limiting recognition of transgender students and potentially others. The memo stated that the government needed to define gender \"on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable\". The news brought immediate protests in several locations as well as online social media under the \"#WontBeErased\" hashtag.\n\nTitle IX has been a source of controversy in part due to claims that the OCR's current interpretation of Title IX, and specifically its three-prong test of compliance, is no longer faithful to the anti-discrimination language in Title IX's text, and instead discriminates against men and has contributed to the reduction of programs for male athletes.\n\nCritics of the three-prong test contend that it operates as a \"quota\" in that it places undue emphasis on the first prong (known as the \"proportionality\" prong), which fails to take into account any differences in the genders' respective levels of interest in participating in athletics (in spite of the third prong, which focuses on any differences in the genders' respective levels of interest in participation). Instead it requires that the genders' athletic participation be substantially proportionate to their enrollment, without regard to interest. Prong two is viewed as only a temporary fix for universities, as universities may only point to past expansion of opportunities for female students for a limited time before compliance with another prong is necessary. Critics say that prong three likewise fails to consider male athletic interest in spite of its gender-neutral language, as it requires that the university fully and effectively accommodate the athletic interests of the \"underrepresented sex\", despite the fact that ED regulations expressly require that the OCR consider whether the institution \"effectively accommodate[s] the interests and abilities of members of both sexes\". As such, with a focus on increasing female athletic opportunities without any counterbalance to take male athletic interest into consideration, critics maintain that the OCR's three-prong test actually operates to discriminate against men.\n\nDefenders of the three-prong test counter that the genders' differing athletic interest levels are merely a product of past discrimination, and that Title IX should be interpreted to maximize female participation in athletics regardless of any existing disparity in interest. Thus while defenders argue that the three-prong test embodies the maxim that \"opportunity drives interest\", critics argue that the three-prong test goes beyond Title IX original purpose of preventing discrimination, and instead amounts to an exercise in which athletic opportunities are taken away from male students and given to female students, despite the comparatively lower interest levels of those female students. Author and self-described women's rights advocate John Irving opined in a \"New York Times\" column that on this topic, women's advocates were being \"purely vindictive\" in insisting that the current OCR interpretation of Title IX be maintained.\n\nOn March 17, 2005, OCR announced a clarification of prong three of the three-part test of Title IX compliance. The guidance concerned the use of web-based surveys to determine the level of interest in varsity athletics among the underrepresented sex. Opponents of the clarification – including the NCAA Executive Committee, which issued a resolution soon afterward asking Association members not to use the survey – claimed the survey was flawed in part because of the way it counted non-responses. On April 20, 2010, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights abandoned the 2005 clarification that allowed institutions to use only Internet or e‑mail surveys to meet the interests and abilities (third prong) option of the three-part test for Title IX compliance.\n\nIn February 2010, the United States Commission on Civil Rights weighed in on the OCR's three-prong test, offering several recommendations on Title IX policy to address what it termed \"unnecessary reduction of men's athletic opportunities\". The Commission advocated use of surveys to measure interest, and specifically recommended that the Department of Education's regulations on interest and abilities be revised \"to explicitly take into account the interest of both sexes rather than just the interest of the underrepresented sex\", almost always females.\n\nOn the twenty-fifth anniversary of Title IX the National Women's Law Center lodged twenty-five complaints with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.\n\nThere were several events praising the 40th anniversary of Title IX in June 2012. For example, the White House Council on Women and Girls hosted a panel to discuss the life-altering nature of sports. Panelists included Billie Jean King, All‑American NCAA point guard Shoni Schimmel of the University of Louisville, and Aimee Mullins, the first double-amputee sprinter to compete in NCAA track and field for Georgetown University.\n\nPresident Barack Obama wrote a pro-Title IX op-ed published in \"Newsweek\" magazine.\n\nThe Women's Sports Foundation honored over 40 female athletes.\n\nOn June 21, 2012, espnW projected a digital mosaic featuring the largest-ever collection of women and girls' sports images (all of which were submitted by the athletes themselves) onto the First Amendment tablet of the Newseum in Washington, D.C.

The Bruins have won 11 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Division I Basketball Championships, the most of any school. UCLA players have been assigned jersey numbers ranging from 0 to 78 in the team's history. The school no longer issues 10 retired numbers in honor of former players. To qualify, a player must have been a three-time consensus All-American, a consensus national player of the year, or been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The retired numbers are displayed in the rafters of the Bruins' home arena, Pauley Pavilion. UCLA's legendary coach John Wooden generally opposed having numbers retired.\n\nNumbers retired by UCLA were originally limited to three-time consensus All-Americans. In 1990, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, known as Lew Alcindor during his UCLA career, and Bill Walton were the first to have their numbers retired. The ceremony was held in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of Pauley Pavilion. Wooden valued team play over individual accolades, and he opposed retiring numbers. \"What about the fellows who wore that number before?\" Wooden asked. \"Didn't they contribute to the team?\" Wooden did think highly of Abdul-Jabbar and Walton. \"If such a thing can be deserved, it'd be Alcindor and Walton. But I don't think it would be anyone else,\" said Wooden.\n\nUCLA in 1996 expanded the requirements for retiring numbers to include players who were consensus national players of the year. This allowed the jersey numbers of Walt Hazzard (No. 42), Sidney Wicks (35), Marques Johnson (54) and Ed O'Bannon (31) to be retired. In 2004, UCLA also allowed players inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame to be eligible, enabling the retirement of Gail Goodrich's No. 25. Three Bruins were inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2012, and UCLA retired their numbers in 2013—Jamaal Wilkes (52), Reggie Miller (31), and Don Barksdale (11).\n\nEight of the players honored were members of NCAA championship teams, and seven of the players were coached by Wooden. Although Hazzard's No. 42 was retired, he allowed Kevin Love (2007–2008) to wear it. Johnson's retired No. 54 was worn by his sons, Kris (1994–1998) and Josiah (2001–2005).\n\nIn addition, UCLA announced on November 22, 2014 that the number 42 would be retired across all university sports in honor of Jackie Robinson, a four-sport star at UCLA who went on to a Hall of Fame career in Major League Baseball and broke that sport's 20th-century color line. While Robinson wore several different numbers while at the school from 1939 to 1941, the number 42 was chosen because it was the number he wore during his Brooklyn Dodgers career. The all-sports retirement had no effect on men's basketball since that number had already been retired for Hazzard; however, Robinson's 42 will be prominently displayed within all UCLA athletic venues, including Pauley Pavilion.\n\n"}

It began on January 20, 1917, as the Association of American Horse Shows, later changed to the American Horse Shows Association (AHSA). In 2001, the organization changed its name to USA Equestrian (USAE) and, in 2003 it merged with the United States Equestrian Team (USET). In 2017, USEF rebranded as US Equestrian. \n\nCompetitions governed by US Equestrian include dressage, driving, endurance riding, eventing, hunt seat equitation, hunter, jumper, para-equestrian, reining, roadster, saddle seat equitation, vaulting, and western riding competition including equitation, western pleasure, reining, trail, western dressage, and related events.\n\nThe organization also governs breed shows held in the United States for the Andalusian, Lusitano, Arabian, Half-Arabian/Anglo-Arabian, Connemara, Friesian, Hackney, Morgan, American Saddlebred, National Show Horse, Paso Fino, Shetland, and Welsh breeds.\n\nUS Equestrian keeps track of yearly points accumulated at individual horse shows throughout the year and gives awards based on these points at the end of the year. Horse shows governed under the USEF are given an AA, A, B, or C rating. Shows with an AA rating are the most prestigious and often offer the most prize money, whereas shows with a C rating are more local, usually awarding less prize money. Competitions recognized by the USEF must follow its rules and bylaws.\n\nGoverning bodies working under the USEF include: \n\n\nOn January 20, 1917, representatives of some fifty horse shows met in Manhattan under the leadership of Reginald C. Vanderbilt. Their intention was to unite in order to assure clean competition in the show ring. They formed the Association of American Horse Shows, which by its first annual meeting on January 29, 1918, included the organizers of 26 well-known horse shows. The association incorporated in June 1918. Membership grew to list 35 member shows in 1919, and 67 shows by 1924. By the time of Vanderbilt's death in 1925, the organization had enrolled almost 70 shows as members of the organization.\n\nAlfred B. Maclay was the next individual elected president. Early in his term, in 1927, the association printed its first set of rules, consisting of a six-page pamphlet. The rules were revised continually and have been added to throughout the history of the association. When Maclay's term ended in 1936, membership included 183 shows.\n\nMaclay was followed by Pierre Lorillard as president. He served a year before Adrian Van Sinderen was elected. Under Van Sinderen, the office was relocated to 90 Broad Street in Manhattan. By the end of Van Sinderen's tenure in 1960, the rule book had grown to one hundred and sixty-eight pages.\n\nThe need for show stewards, representatives of the association to be present at and report on recognized shows, was recognized in the minutes of a 1930 executive committee meeting. It was not until the 1948 rule book that stewards were written in, however, and not until the 1960 rule book that licensing of stewards was in place and recognized in the rules.\n\nIn February 1933 the original name, the Association of American Horse Shows, Inc., was changed to the American Horse Shows Association, Inc. At the same meeting, individual members were recognized in addition to show members.\n\nIn 1935, a committee reported on their investigation of the transfer of control of the United States' membership in the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) membership from the United States Cavalry Association to the AHSA. The transfer of membership took place after the 1936 Summer Olympics, and after that, in the United States, the FEI rules applied only to international military classes. By this time, AHSA membership had grown to include 183 members and shows.\n\nBy 1937, the new rule book reflected the growth of the association by dividing the United States into five zones, each with a vice president and a five-member regional committee.\n\nIn 1939, the association began publication of the monthly magazine, \"Horse Show\", with an initial circulation of 1,200 copies. By this time there were 187 recognized shows, and 800 individual members.\n\nIn 1960, the association began sending licensed stewards to each affiliated show to report and verify that the show was following the association's rules.\n\nIn 1999, the association moved from its Manhattan office to the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nIn 2001, AHSA changed its name to USA Equestrian (USAE) to represent the organization's role more effectively in the United States. At that time, the organization had over 80,000 individual members. There were more than 2,700 member competitions, 100 affiliate organizations, and 26 breeds and disciplines were recognized.\n\nIn 2003, USA Equestrian and the United States Equestrian Team (USET) joined together to take on responsibilities as a national governing body and became the United States Equestrian Federation.\n\nIn 2017, USEF rebranded to US Equestrian under the new President, Murray Kessler, launching the new campaign \"Discover the Joy of Horse Sports.\" \n\n"}
