Details have survived of seven important matches. The earliest known innings victory is believed to have happened and the earliest known surviving cricket bat dates from the season. The earliest known reference to cricket in the county of Gloucestershire has been found.\n\nThe following matches are classified as important:\n\nIt appears that Gage's XI was representative of three counties and so should perhaps be considered a Rest of England team formed to challenge Kent, who had hitherto enjoyed: \"the scale of victory, which for some years past has been generally on the Kentish side\" (see above). The match on 24 June involved a team specifically named Sussex, but the result is unknown. Despite losing to Gage's team in August, Kent under the patronage of Edwin Stead is generally believed to have been the strongest county team of the 1720s.\n\nThere is a bat in The Oval pavilion which belonged to John Chitty of Knaphill, Surrey. Dated 1729, it is the oldest known bat. It looks more like a field hockey stick than a modern cricket bat but its curvature was to enable the batsman to play a ball that was always rolled or skimmed along the ground, as in bowls, never pitched. Pitching began about 30 years later and the straight bats used nowadays were invented in response to the pitched delivery. \n\nDr Samuel Johnson attended the University of Oxford from October 1728 until the following summer and later told James Boswell that cricket matches were played there. Boswell mentioned this in his \"Life of Samuel Johnson\".\n\n\"Tuesday, 5 August\". Gentlemen of Middlesex v Gentlemen of London was announced, to be played at the \"Woolpack\", Islington. The venue was described as \"in the Field behind the \"Woolpack\" Back Gate near Sadler's Wells\", the match having a stake of £50 per side. Several sources have listed the match in 1728 due to an error in original research. As London were playing Dartford on the same day (see above), this match was as advertised \"gentlemen only\". \n\nA local game in Gloucester on Monday, 22 September is the earliest known reference to cricket in Gloucestershire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Deemed unsafe and illegal by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile. Appendix A to the International Sporting Code determines which substances are banned and mandates penalties.\n\nThe Appendix regarding doping in auto racing was added on 1 December 2010 after consultation with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The regulations apply to all FIA and national sanctioned events. The FIA adopts the banned substance list issued by WADA. The FIA has added alcohol and beta blockers to the list. The FIA will test at random from a pre determined pool of drivers. The national sanctioning body will test a number of athletes during their events.\n\nIn case of a positive doping test, the driver in question will be disqualified, have his/hers results forfeited and has to return all their winnings. In case of negligence by the driver will only be disqualified for the event on hand. In case of a second violation the driver will be banned from the sport for six months. More severe penalties could be imposed, depending on the circumstances. The driver has to pay back price money won. A fine of up to € 15.000 can be imposed. \n\nSince the series inception in 1996, INDYCAR has a substance abuse policy in place. The policy is applied to all series sanctioned by INDYCAR, currently the IndyCar Series, Indy Lights, Pro Mazda, USF2000 and Global MX-5 Cup. Drivers, crew and officials can be subjected to testing (depending on the series). The INDYCAR organisation can subject subjects to test at random. INDYCAR may require a drug test also in events of 'reasonable suspicion'. Reasonable suspicion includes, but is not limited to, violent temper or an accident during the event. When a driver is tested positive for performance enhancing drugs (PED) the driver will be suspended for one year. A fine of $ 5.000 wil also be imposed. With a non-PED positive test (alcohol for example) the driver will be suspended for no less than sixty days. A fine of $ 2.500 wil also be imposed. \n\nIn the case of multiple violations the driver will be penalized again. The height of the penalty will be determined by the specific circumstances. The driver may return to competition after psychological and medical evaluation.\n\nNASCAR has its own anti doping regulations. The substance abuse policy was first implemented in the late 1980s. Flaws in the systems allowed drivers to continue to use banned substances. One notorious case was that of Aaron Fike. After being arrested for heroin possession, Fike admitted using black tar heroin during race weekends. In 2009, Jeremy Mayfield failed a drug test for methamphetamine with his stepmother declaring Mayfield has used meth as early as 1998. After sitting out the initial penalty, Mayfield tested positive again. Mayfield could return to NASCAR competition after completing the Road to Recovery. The driver however has questioned the credibility of the testing laboratory recognized by NASCAR.\n\nFollowing the case of Fike and the case of Mayfield, the policy was overhauled. A.J. Allmendinger was one of the first big name drivers failing a drug test. Allmendinger tested positive for Adderall. Allmendinger was suspended, fired by team owner Roger Penske, and returned to competition 2,5 months. Because of the nature of the NASCAR garage, drivers and crew members can be tested by the organisation, especially because performance enhancing drugs can be abused by crew members. Crew chief Todd Parrott, for driver Aric Almirola, tested positive for an 'undisclosed substance'. The NASCAR policy is consistent with the FIA's policy. \n\nIn 2018 28-year old Spencer Gallagher won his first NASCAR Xfinity Series race on 28th of April. On May 1st Gallagher failed the drug test. Gallagher was suspended indefinitely and agreed to join the Road to Recovery program.n \n\nAfter testing positive for a banned substance, the person in question is suspended indefinitely. To return to competition the person needs to complete the NASCAR Road to Recovery and have a Road to Recovery Plan approved. The plan includes treatment, rehabilitation, counseling and other measures necessary to prevent repetition.\n\nThe United States Auto Club has implemented a substance abuse policy since 2008. USAC also has a self determined list of banned substances, with the exclusion of prescription medication (used in accordance with the purpose and instruction). The policy states that USAC has to have reasonable suspicion that banned substances are used. The policy states (but is not limited to) a list of symptoms for drug and/or alcohol use. USAC also has the right to test at random. With a positive drug or alcohol test the USAC Director of Competition may suspend the driver indefinitely. After the failure of a drug test, the driver can return to competition after a negative drug test after the suspension period. After a failed alcohol test, the driver only has to sit out the suspended period. In both cases the driver will be subjected to more frequent tests in the future. \n\nThe World Racing Group, sanctioning body of the World of Outlaws and DIRTcar series, started regularly testing the sprint car and late model series drivers in 2017. Drivers will only be tested through urinalysis. The random selection process will take place on the day of the event, treating full season drivers and parttime drivers equally. After a positive test, the driver receives a fine and will be banned from competition. After three failed tests (and three penalties) the driver can only return to competition after two negative tests and approval from World Racing Group.\n\nJustin Ratliff was the first driver hit with a penalty. Ratliff refused a drug test after the 2017 DIRTcar Nationals at Volusia Speedway Park in February. Because of the refusal Ratliff was fined in accordance of the first offense with a 90 day suspension. In June 2017, Brian Lay tested positive after the World of Outlaws event at Eldora Speedway. He was also fined in accordance with a first offense. In July Jacob Hawkins failed a drug test after the Dirt Late Model Dream event at Eldora Speedway.\n\nThe International Motor Contest Association, the oldest active motorsports sanctioning body in the United States, has regulations with regard to drugs and alcohol. The 2017 IMCA General Rules and Procedures state the following with regard to drugs and alcohol: \"Consumption of alcoholic beverage by driver or his/her crew in advance of, or while competing in any IMCA sanctioned program is strictly forbidden. Any driver showing evidence of alcohol consumption will be required to leave the premises immediately and may be subject to a fine of no less than $250. Use of illegal drugs at any time shall be cause for immediate, indefinite suspension and/or fine of no less than $250.\"\n\nDuring the 2002 International Formula 3000 Championship Czech racer Tomáš Enge tested positive after the race at the Hungaroring. Enge raced the remaining rounds of the championship while there was an investigation. The Czech driver went on to win the championship, however the FIA determined in October that the test was positive and Enge was disqualified from the Hungaroring round. Enge dropped to third in the championship standings and Sebastien Bourdais was the official champion. In 2012 Enge again tested positive for a banned substance. After the 2012 FIA GT1 Navarra round Enge tested positive, him claiming it was a drug for medical purposes. The FIA banned Enge from motorsports for 18 months. He returned to competition in 2014 racing in the Blancpain Endurance Series.\n\nMontagny tested positive for a cocaine derivative (Benzoylecgonine) after the 2014 Putrajaya ePrix. Montagny was disqualified from the race but kept his championship points and podium finish from the previous race. The 37-year old was banned from motorsport for two years after a second test also proved positive. The Frenchman publicly feared that the ban would be the effective end to his racing career. His ban was lifted on December 23, 2016 but he has not competed since.\n\nIn 2015 Brazilian former IndyCar Series driver Raphael Matos failed a drug test. Matos competed in the 2015 Stock Car Brasil season. After the October round at Curitiba Matos tested positive for a banned substance. The Brazilian Automobile Confederation suspended his licence for two years. Matos returned to competition in the Trans-Am Series. Matos made his debut in the 2017 Motor City 100 finishing second in the TA2 class.\n"}

It was formerly part of the grounds of Langtons House and was known as Langton Park when it was a first-class cricket ground.\n\nIt is located on land that was part of the grounds of Langtons House, built in the 18th century. The park, known as Langton Park, was the home of Hornchurch Cricket Club and was a major venue from 1785 to 1793. At that time, the Hornchurch club was representative of Essex as a county.\n\nThe earliest recorded first-class match at Langton Park was in May 1785 when Essex played Middlesex and the last was Essex v MCC in May 1793. The ground faded from the records as the Napoleonic Wars progressed and Essex ceased to have a first-class county team.\n\nBy 1889, the Hornchurch club had moved from Langtons to nearby Grey Towers. It is still used by the club as a secondary location to Harrow Lodge Park.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13061016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13061016", "title": "Glossary of rugby union terms", "text": "Glossary of rugby union terms\n\nRugby union is a team sport played between two teams of fifteen players. It is known for its rich terminology.\n\nThis is a general glossary of the terminology used in the sport of rugby union. Where words in a sentence are also defined elsewhere in this article, they appear in italics. \n\n22\n\nThe 22 m line, marking from the tryline.\n\n89\n\nAn \"89\" or \"eight-nine move\" is a phase following a \"scrum\", in which the \"number 8\" picks up the ball and transfers it to number 9 (\"scrum-half\").\n\n99\n\nThe \"99\" call was a policy of simultaneous retaliation by the 1974 British Lions tour to South Africa, (the 99 comes from the British emergency services telephone number which is 999). The tour was marred by on-pitch violence, which the match officials did not adequately control and the relative absence of cameras compared to the modern game made citing and punishment after the fact unlikely. The Lions' captain, Willie John McBride (Ireland), therefore instigated a policy of \"one in, all in\" - that is, when one Lions player retaliated, all other Lions were expected to join in the melee or hit the nearest Springbok. By doing so, the referee would be unable to identify any single instigator, and so would be left with the choice of sending off all or none of the team. In this respect, the \"99\" call was extremely successful - no Lions player was sent off during the tour.\n\nAccidental offside\n\nsee \"Offside\"\n\nAdvantage\n\n\"Advantage\" is the period of time after an infringement in which the non-offending side have the opportunity to gain sufficient territory or tactical opportunity to negate the need to stop the game due to the infringement. The referee will signal advantage with his arm out horizontally toward the non-infringing team. If no tactical or territorial advantage is gained, the referee will whistle and give the decision that had been delayed. If sufficient advantage is gained, the referee will call \"advantage over\", and play will continue. The Advantage Law allows the game to flow more freely, and not stop for every minor infringement, giving no incentive for a player to commit \"intentional\" fouls. \n\nAn example of the application of advantage would be if Team A knocked the ball on (technical offence, conceding a scrum) but a Team B player picked the ball up and made a run forwards before being tackled.\n\nAdvantage line\n\nAlso called the \"gain line\". It is an imaginary line drawn across the centre of the pitch when there is a breakdown in open play, such as a \"ruck\", \"maul\" or \"scrum\". Advancing across the gain line represents a gain in territory.\n\nAnkle tap\n\nAn ankle-tap or \"tap-tackle\" is a form of tackle. It is used when the player carrying the ball is running at speed and a defending player is approaching from behind. Even if the defender is not able to get close enough to the ball-carrier to wrap his arms around him in a conventional tackle, he may still be able to dive at the other player's feet and, with outstretched arm, deliver a tap or hook to the player's foot (or feet) causing the player to stumble.\n\nBall back\n\nIf the ball enters touch, then play is restarted by a \"line-out\" at the point where the ball left the field of play. The exception to this is if the ball is kicked into touch on the full. In this case, a \"line-out\" is taken at the point from where the ball was kicked, and not from where it entered \"touch\".\n\nBall back is waived in certain circumstances:\n\n\nBill\n\nAustralian name given to the (William Webb Ellis) Webb Ellis Cup.\n\nBlack dot\n\nA mark in the centre of the crossbar connecting the goal posts, usually black in colour, used as an aid to kickers with their aiming. A player scoring a try in the centre of the goal line, that is beneath the posts, can be said to have scored \"under the black dot\".\n\nBlindside\n\nThe narrow side of the pitch in relation to a scrum or a breakdown in play; it is the opposite of \"openside\". The blindside flanker is expected to cover the opposing team blindside at \"scrum\" and \"breakdown\".\n\nThe Blindside of the scrum is the side that the opposing scrum half is feeding the ball from. The Open side is the other side, 'Open' in this situation, means unimpeded. \n\nBlitz defence\n\nThe blitz defence is a defensive technique similar to the defence used in rugby league. It relies on the whole defensive line moving forward towards their marked man as one, as soon as the ball leaves the base of a \"ruck\" or \"maul\". The charge is usually led by the inside centre.\n\nThe idea of this technique is to prevent the attacking team gaining any ground by tackling them behind the gain line and forcing interceptions and charged down kicks. However, the defending team can be vulnerable to chip kicks and any player breaking the defensive line will have lots of space to play because the defence are running the other way and must stop, turn and chase.\n\nBlood bin\n\nIt is also called blood replacement. A player who has a visible bleeding injury may be replaced for up to fifteen minutes (running time not game time), during which he or she may receive first-aid treatment to stop the flow of blood and dress the wound. The player may then return to the pitch to continue playing.\n\nBonus points\n\nBonus points are a method of deciding table points from a rugby union match. It was implemented in order to encourage attacking play throughout a match, to discourage repetitive goal-kicking, and to reward teams for \"coming close\" in losing efforts.\n\nBox-kick\n\nThis is a kick taken from behind a scrum, normally by the scrum-half, in which he turns away from the scrum facing the touchline, and kicks the ball back over the scrum into the clear \"box\" of space behind the opposition to allow his own team to chase through and regain the ball in undefended territory .\n\nBreakdown\n\nThe breakdown is a colloquial term for the short period of open play immediately after a tackle and before and during the ensuing ruck. During this time teams compete for possession of the ball, initially with their hands and then using feet in the \"ruck\". Most referees will call \"ruck\" or \"hands away\" as soon as the ruck is formed. Most infringements take place at the breakdown, owing to the greater variety of possible offences at a breakdown, for example handling in the ruck, killing the ball, offside at the ruck and so on.\n\nCaution\n\nA player who deliberately or repeatedly infringes the laws is cautioned, and shown a yellow card. A cautioned player is suspended from playing for ten minutes.\n\nCavalry Charge\n\nTypically during a penalty kick or free kick, the attacking players form a line behind their kicker. When signaled, they charge forward. The kicker then tap-kicks the ball and passes to one of the players behind. This move is explicitly forbidden under 10.4(p) and the penalty is a penalty kick.\n\nCentre\n\nThey are the players wearing shirts numbers 12 & 13. They are divided into inside and outside centre. The inside centre is also known as the \"second five-eighths\" in New Zealand.\n\nCharge-down\n\nWhen a player makes a defensive clearance kick, but it hits an opponent who has run towards him in an attempt to block it, it is known as a charge-down. These can be good try-scoring opportunities.\n\nChoke tackle\n\nTackle in which the tackler tries to keep the ball carrier on his feet and push him backwards before taking him to the ground. This is harder to execute but gives the tackler's side a gain in territory.\n\nCibi\n\nThe cibi is a Fijian war dance performed by the Fiji national team before each of their international matches.\n\nConversion\n\nIf a team scores a try, they have an opportunity to \"convert\" it for two further points by kicking the ball between the posts and above the crossbar - that is, through the goal. The kick is taken at any point on the field of play in line with the point that the ball was grounded for the try, parallel to the touch-lines. So it is advantageous to score a try nearer to the posts as it is easier to convert it.\n\nThe kick can be either a \"drop kick\" or a \"place kick\" in the 15-man game. However, in sevens, all conversions must be drop kicks.\n\nCounter rucking\n\nIf a team (usually the team that took the ball into contact) has secured the ball at a ruck, and the other team manage to force them off the ball and secure possession themselves, the defending team are said to have \"counter-rucked\"\n\nCrash ball\n\nIt is an attacking tactic where a player receives a pass at pace and runs directly at the opposition's defensive line. The crash ball runner attempts to commit two or more opposing players to the \"tackle\", then attempts to make the ball available to team-mates by \"off-loading\" in the tackle or recycling the ball quickly from the \"ruck\".\n\nBy committing players to the tackle, the crash ball runner creates holes in the opposition's defense, thereby creating attacking opportunities for team-mates.\n\nCrash tackle\n\nAnother name for the \"crash ball\" as mentioned above.\n\nCross-Field Kick\n\nA kick which goes from one side of the field to the other and is kicked very high, usually resulting in an aerial battle between an attacker and defender to catch it. This is usually used near the defending team's try-line, often with the catch happening in the in-goal area itself. Most often used when the kicker knows the referee is playing advantage and his team will get a penalty if the kick fails - this is because the kick itself is very risky and likely to result in an interception.\n\nDrop goal\n\nA drop goal is scored when a player kicks the ball from hand through the opposition's goal, but the ball must touch the ground between being dropped and kicked. It is worth three points.\n\nThe team awarded a free kick cannot score a dropped goal until the ball next becomes dead, or until an opponent has played or touched it, or has tackled the ball carrier. This restriction applies also to a scrum taken instead of a free kick.\n\nDrift defence\n\nThe drift defence is a defensive technique which forces the attacking side into an ever shrinking pocket near to the touchline. It operates by the defensive side moving forward and diagonally following the path of the attacking side's ball movements. If used successfully the ball will usually end up in the attacking winger's hands near the line of touch. This player would then find themselves surrounded on one side by a defending outside centre, with the opposing winger opposite and the touchline on his other side. This will prevent a cut-back and allows the Touchline to act as a 16th player. Its disadvantage is that if the attacking team are strong enough to break through the pocket tackle the defending team will have no players spare to cover a breakout.\n\nDrop kick\n\nA drop kick is when a player kicks the ball from hand and the ball touches the ground between being dropped and kicked. If a drop kick goes through a goal then it results in a \"drop goal\".\n\nDummy pass\n\nAn offensive ruse, where the ball carrier moves as if to pass the ball to a team-mate, but then continues to run with the ball himself; the objective is to trick defenders into marking the would-be pass receiver, creating a gap for the ball carrier to run into. If it is successful, the player is said to have \"sold the dummy\".\n\nDummy runner\n\nAnother offensive tactic; a player on the attacking team runs towards the opposition as if running onto a pass, only for the ball to be passed to another player, carried on by the ball carrier or kicked forwards. As with a \"dummy pass\", this tactic draws defenders away from the ball and creates space for the attacking team\n\nDump tackle\n\nIt is a tackling technique. The tackler wraps his arms around the ball carrier's thighs and lifts him a short distance in the air before forcibly driving him to the ground. The tackler must go to ground with the ball carrier for the tackle to be legal. This technique is useful to completely stop the opponent in his tracks. A dump tackle which drops the ball carrier on his head or neck is known as a \"spear tackle\", and will almost invariably concede a penalty and possibly result in a caution for the tackler. In rugby union, World Rugby has ruled that a dangerous tackle of this type, sometimes also called a tip tackle, should be punished with a straight red card.\n\nEightman, Eighth-man\n\nAlternative name for the Number 8\n\nFive metre scrum, Scrum-five\n\nWhen a scrum offence is committed within 5m of either try line, or a player carries the ball over his own try line and touches it down, the referee will award a scrum on the five metre line; this is to prevent all but the most brutal packs from driving the ball over the try line within the scrum.\n\nFend or \"hand off\"\n\nFending is the action by the ball carrier of repelling a tackler using his arm. For the action to be legal, the ball carrier's arm must be straight before contact is made; a shove or \"straight-arm smash\", where the arm is extended immediately before contact or on contact, is illegal and classed as dangerous play.\n\nFirst XV or First fifteen\n\nThe preferred starting line-up of a team - more colloquially, the senior team of any club.\n\nFlanker\n\nAlso known as breakaways or wing forwards. They are the players wearing shirts numbers 6 & 7. They are the players with the fewest set responsibilities. The player should have all round attributes: speed, strength, fitness, tackling and handling skills. Flankers are always involved in the game, as they are the real ball winners at the \"breakdown\", especially the number 7. The two flankers do not usually bind to the \"scrum\" in a fixed position. Instead, the \"openside\" flanker will attach to the scrum on whichever side is further from the nearer touchline, while the \"blindside\" flanker attaches himself to the scrum on the side closer to the touchline.\n\nFly half or five-eighth\n\nReferred to by a number of different names, including \"first five-eighth\" in New Zealand, this player wears shirt number 10. They are the back-line player most likely to be passed the ball from the scrum-half or half-back, and therefore make many key tactical decisions during a game. Often this player is also the goal kicker as the position requires excellent kicking skills.\n\nForward pass\n\nIt is called a throw-forward in the laws of the game.\n\nA forward pass occurs when the ball fails to travel backwards in a pass. If the ball is not thrown or passed forward but it bounces forward after hitting a player or the ground, it is not a throw-forward.\n\nIf the referee deems it accidental, this results in a \"scrum\" to the opposing team; however deliberate forward passes result in the award of a \"penalty\".\n\nFoul play\n\nFoul play is defined as the deliberate infringement of the laws of the game.\n\nFourth official\n\nA fourth official is one who controls replacements and substitutes. He may also substitute for referee or touch judge in case of injury to either of them.\n\nFree-kick\n\nAlso called \"short arm penalty\". This is a lesser form of the penalty, usually awarded to a team for a technical offence committed by the opposing side such as numbers at the line-out or time wasting at a scrum. A free kick is also awarded for calling a \"mark\".\n\nA team cannot kick for goal and the normal 22m rule applies for kicking for position from a free kick. A Free Kick is signalled by the referee with a bent arm raised in the air.\n\nFull-back\n\nThey are the player wearing jersey number 15. They act as the last line of defence against running attacks by the opposing three-quarter backs. The full-back is expected to field high kicks from the opposition, and reply with a superior kick or a counter-attack. The full back is sometimes the specialist goal-kicker in a team, taking penalty and conversion kicks.\n\nFull house\n\nScoring a \"try\", \"conversion\", \"penalty\" and \"drop goal\" in the same match.\n\nGain line\n\nThe gain line is an imaginary line drawn across the centre of the pitch when there is a \"breakdown\" in open play, such as a ruck, maul or scrum. Advancing across the gain line represents a gain in territory.\n\nGarryowen\n\nA Garryowen, or up-and-under kick, is a high short punt onto or behind the defending team.\n\nGoal\n\nA goal is scored when a player kicks the ball through the plane bounded by the two uprights and above the crossbar. A \"drop goal\" or \"penalty goal\" count for 3 points and \"conversions\" count for two.\n\nGoal from mark\n\nGoal from mark is an antiquated method of scoring. It occurred when a player \"marked\" and scored a goal from there. In the modern game, a goal cannot be scored from a free kick, but in the past the reward for scoring a \"goal from mark\" (which is a difficult kick to play) was three or four points. Occasionally referred to as a field goal.\n\nGoal line, Tryline\n\nTwo solid, straight white lines (one at each end) stretching across the entire width of the pitch passing directly through the goal posts which defines the boundary between the \"field of play\" and the \"in-goal\". As the goal line is defined as part of the \"in-goal\", attacking players can score tries by placing the ball with downward pressure onto the goal line itself. The base of the goal posts and post protectors are also defined to be part of the goal line.\n\nThe goal line is often referred to as the \"try line\" though that term does not appear in the Laws of the Game.\n\nGoose Step\n\nA goose step, made famous by Australian David Campese but now performed by many players, is a running technique where the player slows down and takes a small 'hop' into the air before sprinting off - sometimes in a different direction - upon landing. Its purpose is to confuse the defender, who is often unable to predict the sudden change of pace and direction.\n\nGroup of death\n\nIs an informal sobriquet used to describe a situation that often occurs during the group stage of a tournament, where either (1) \"any\" team in the group could qualify and \"any\" team could be eliminated, or (2) more teams have a legitimate chance to advance to the next stage than allowed by the tournament structure.\n\nTypically, a group of death will see an unusual match-up of heavyweight sides, due to a quirk in the seeding system.\n\nGrubber kick\n\nIt is a type of kick which makes the ball roll and tumble across the ground, producing irregular bounces making it hard for the defending team to pick up the ball without causing a knock-on. It gives the ball both high and low bounce and on occasions, the ball can sit up in a perfect catching position.\n\nHalf-back\n\nCan refer to either the scrum-half or fly-half, but in New Zealand is exclusively used to describe the scrum-half.\n\nHaka\n\nThe haka is a traditional Māori dance performed by New Zealand national teams, most famously the All Blacks, prior to international matches. It serves as a challenge to the opposing team.\n\nHand-off\n\nHanding off (also called \"fend\") is the action by the ball carrier of repelling a tackler using his arm. For the action to be legal, the ball carrier's arm must be straight before contact is made; a shove or \"straight-arm smash\", where the arm is extended immediately before contact or on contact, is illegal and classed as dangerous play.\n\nHigh tackle\n\nA high tackle (or head-high tackle) is a form of tackle where the tackler grasps the ball carrier above the line of the shoulders (most commonly around the neck or at the line of the chin and jaw). Executed violently or at speed, a high tackle is potentially dangerous, so are often not just sanctioned with a penalty, but also a yellow or red card.\n\nHooker\n\nHookers traditionally wear the number 2 shirt. The hooker is the player who is in the centre position of the front row of the scrum and who uses his/her feet to 'hook' the ball back. Due to the pressure put on the body by the scrum and the requirement to use both arms to bind to other players (and hence having no free arm to use to support or deflect bodyweight) it is considered to be one of the most dangerous positions to play.\n\nHookers normally throw the ball in at \"line-outs\", partly because they are normally the shortest of the forwards, but more often because they are the most skillful of the forwards.\n\nHospital pass\n\nAny pass that is made which has the inevitable, unavoidable consequence of the receiver being tackled. This is because the receiver has already been marked and the opposing player is bearing down on the receiver so rapidly that, as soon as the ball is caught, the opposing player smashes into the receiver. Generally made in times of panic or when there is no-one else available, it is called the hospital pass because of the inevitability of a hard tackle.\n\nInterception\n\nThe gaining of possession by running forward from the defensive line and taking a pass meant for a member of the opposition. The result is similar to the result of a \"line break\", and has a good chance of leading to a \"try\".\n\nKick-off\n\nA coin is tossed and the winning captain either chooses which direction his team shall play, or elects to take the kick that starts the game. Both halves of the match are started with a \"drop kick\" from the centre-point of the halfway line. The kick must cross the opposition's 10-metre line, unless played by a member of the receiving team. The opposition are not allowed to encroach beyond the 10-metre line until the ball is kicked.\n\nIf the ball does not travel 10 metres, goes straight into touch, or goes over the dead ball line at the end of the pitch, the opposing team may accept the kick, have the ball kicked off again, or have a \"scrum\" at the centre.\n\nAfter a score, the game is restarted from the same place under the same restrictions, with the conceding team drop-kicking the ball to the scoring team. However, in sevens, the scoring team kicks off.\n\nKick tennis\n\nStyle of play characterised by both teams repeatedly kicking from hand to the opposition, rather than running at the opposition and risking a \"turnover\". So-called because the ball moves back and forth like in a tennis match. It is considered boring to watch and also referred to as aerial ping-pong.\n\nKnock-on\n\nAlso called knock-forward. A knock-on is when the ball unintentionally moves forward after coming into contact with a player above the waist then hits either the ground or another player. It results in a \"scrum\" with the put-in to the opposition. If the ball is intentionally knocked forward it is deemed a deliberate knock-on; the opposition is rewarded with a penalty and the offending player is given a yellow card and sent to the sin bin.\n\nLatcher/Latching on\n\nA latcher is a player who binds himself to the ballcarrier in open play in order to add his power and weight to an attempt to \"break the line\" and gain yards. If the defence is able to stop the ballcarrier and hold him up, a \"maul\" usually forms. However latching on does not automatically create a maul.\n\nLate tackle\n\nA late tackle is a tackle executed on a player who has already passed or kicked away the ball. As it is illegal to tackle a player who does not have the ball, late tackles are penalty offences (referees allow a short margin of error where the tackler was already committed to the tackle) and if severe or reckless may result in yellow or red Cards.\n\nIf a late tackle occurs after a kick and a penalty is awarded, the non-offending team has the option of taking the penalty where the ball landed.\n\nLoose head\n\nThe loose head prop is the player who takes the left hand position on the front row of the \"scrum\". A loose head prop traditionally wears the number 1 shirt.\n\nAs the loose head has considerable potential freedom of movement compared to other front row players, the loose head can attempt to play various illegal techniques to divert the push of the opposing pack and is often able to illegally interfere with the ball in the scrum using his free arm.\n\nLine break\n\nAction by which the player with the ball gets through the opponent's defensive line without being tackled. If there is insufficient cover, or the player has support, line breaks can often lead to tries.\n\nLine-out\n\nA minimum of two players line up parallel with each other two metres apart between the five-metre and 15-metre lines. The hooker of the team in possession throws the ball in while his opposite number [may] stand in between the touchline and the five-metre line. \n\nAll players not involved in the lineout, except the scrum-half, must retire 10 metres.\n\nThe ball must be thrown in straight down the middle of the lineout and the hooker must not cross into the field of play while throwing in. If the throw is not straight then the throw is given to the opposition or a \"scrum\" awarded.\n\nJumpers can be lifted by their team-mates below the waist, but the opposition's jumpers must not be obstructed, barged or pulled down.\n\nLine-out code\n\nIt is a coded piece of information, used to communicate intentions about a \"line-out\" within one team in a match without giving information away to the other team. The advantage in line-out comes from knowing in advance how the throw will be made.\n\nLine speed\n\nThe speed with which a \"blitz defence\" closes down the opposing team. A high line speed will make it difficult for the opposition to cross the \"gain line\".\n\nLock\n\nLocks or second-row are the players wearing shirts number 4 & 5. Locks are very tall, athletic and have an excellent standing jump along with good strength. This makes them the primary targets at \"line-outs\". They also make good ball carriers, bashing holes in the defence around the ruck and maul. They also have to push in the \"rucks\" and \"mauls\".\n\nMark\n\nA mark is the place where the game will restart after a stoppage, such as where a scrum-offence or penalty offence occurred, or on the touchline where the ball went out of play (or where the ball was kicked in the case of ball-back). Marks are generally defined by the referee, or the touch judge when the ball leaves play by the touchline.\n\nMarks can also be defined by a defending player who executes a clean catch (catches the ball before it bounces or touches another player) of a ball kicked by an attacking player if the defender is standing within his/her own 22-metre zone or in-goal. To \"call a mark\", the player shouts \"Mark!\" as he/she catches the ball. The referee then awards that player a free kick which must be taken by that specific player. (If, for whatever reason, that player cannot take the kick, a scrum is awarded instead.) If the player is simply a poor kicker he/she is likely to take a 'Tap Kick' and immediately pass the ball to the fly-half or full back who will generally deliver a clearance kick.\n\nMarks can be called when the ball is cleanly caught following a kick by the opposition for any type of kick except a kick off or restart after a score. It is legal, though very unusual, to call a mark from a clean catch of a penalty kick.\n\nMaul\n\nWhen a ball carrier is held up (without being tackled) by both an opposing player and a player from his own team, a maul is then considered formed.\n\nThe offside line becomes the last foot of the last man on each side of the maul. Players can join in only from behind that team-mate. Anyone who comes in from the sides will be penalised by the referee. Hands are allowed to be used in the maul. If either team deliberately collapses the maul then that side will be penalised by the referee. (Note that from August 1, 2008, the IRB is conducting a global trial of a modification of this Law which will allow players to deliberately collapse a maul providing the collapse is achieved by pulling from above the waist.)\n\nIf the ball does not come out in a timely fashion, the referee will award a scrum to the team that did not take the ball into the maul.\n\nMauls can only exist in the field of play. Play that looks like a maul can exist within the in-goal but restrictions on entry to the maul and the need to bind on to a team member do not apply.\n\nMedical joker\n\nA player signed by a professional club as an injury replacement. The term is directly borrowed from the French \"joker médical\" and is most commonly associated with France's top league; that country has long allowed such signings.\n\nMismatch\n\nSituation where a back is one-on-one with a forward. This favours the attacking side, as often forwards are too slow to stop backs, and backs are too small to stop forwards.\n\nMulligrubber\n\nThe mulligrubber kick is a style of kicking. A mulligrubber is directed towards the ground and forced to bounce. Often used in situations where either the ball needs to be placed in a specific position (i.e. on the try line) or to intentionally stop the opponent from being able to catch the ball on the full.\n\nNorth (to go north, to head north, etc.)\n\nIn the days prior to professionalism in rugby union, players would often convert to rugby league — which was a paid sport — thereby becoming ineligible to again play rugby union. In Wales and (to a lesser extent) England, the term \"to go north\" referred to this change of code, an allusion to the popularity of rugby league in the north of England.\n\nNot straight\n\nReferee's call when a \"line-out\" throw or the feeding of the ball into the \"scrum\" is unfairly towards the team in possession, preventing any contest for the ball. It is punished by resetting the set piece and giving control of the ball to the opposition.\n\nNumber 8\n\nThey are the players wearing shirts number 8. It is the only position that is known only by the shirt number. Number eights must have a good tactical awareness in order to coordinate scrums and ruck moves with the scrum-half. If the ball is at his feet at the back of a scrum, ruck or maul, it is normally the number eight's decision whether to pass the ball out or drive the breakdown on in order to make ground.\n\nObstruction\n\nOffence whereby a player deliberately impedes an opponent who does not have the ball.\n\nOff-load pass\n\nA short pass made by a player being tackled before he reaches the ground, usually by turning to face a team-mate and tossing the ball into the air for a team-mate to catch.\n\nOffside\n\nA player is offside when he/she is forward of the relevant offside line i.e. between the relevant offside line and the opposing team's dead ball line.\n\nIn a match, most players will be offside several times but they only become liable for penalty if they do not act to attempt to become onside (which generally means retreat downfield) or attempt to interfere with play.\n\nIn open play, only the ball carrier's team (or the team that last carried or deliberately touched the ball) is bound by offside - the offside line for them is the ball. (Note every player who passes the ball backwards is offside and must attempt to retire.)\n\nAn \"accidental offside\" may occur (and be penalised) if the ball carrier accidentally collides with one of his own team's players while that player is attempting to retire behind the ball (or is otherwise in an offside position).\n\nOnside\n\nA player is onside whenever he or she is behind the relevant offside line for the particular phase of play. Players who are onside take an active part in playing the game.\n\nPreviously offside players may be \"put onside\" by the actions of other players (for example, in a kick ahead in open play, players in the kicker's team in front of the kick are offside but can be put onside by the kicker or any other team member who was onside at the time of the kick running up the pitch past them). So that players can be confident they are now onside and can take an active part in the game, the referee may shout \"Onside\" or \"All Onside\".\n\nOn the full\n\nIf the ball is kicked into touch without first bouncing inside the field of play it is termed as ball is kicked into touch on the full. The \"line-out\" is then taken from where the ball was kicked, except in situations where it was kicked from inside the \"22\".\n\nOpenside\n\nThe broad side of the pitch in relation to a \"scrum\" or a \"breakdown\" in play. The openside flanker is expected to cover the opposing team openside at \"scrum\" and \"breakdown\". It is the opposite of \"blindside\".\n\nOverlap\n\nSituation where there are more attacking players (typically backs) on one side of the field than there are defending players. An overlap can be used to manufacture a try by forcing the defenders into tackles and offloading to teammates until the defenders have run out.\n\nPack\n\nThe pack is another name used for the forwards players, particularly when they are bound for a scrum. \n\nPassing\n\nA pass is to transfer a ball to a teammate by throwing it. Passes in rugby must not travel forwards. There are different varieties of pass, including the flat, direct spin pass; the short, close-quarters pop pass; and the floated pass - a long pass which an advancing player can run onto at pace.\n\nPenalty\n\nPenalties are awarded for serious infringements like dangerous play, offside and handling the ball on the ground in a ruck. Penalties are signalled by the referee with a straight arm raised in the air. Players can also receive red and yellow cards, as in Association football.\n\nThe offending team must retire 10 metres (or to their goal line if closer) for both penalties and free kicks. A team can either kick for goal, \"tap\" and run the ball, take a scrum or kick directly into touch with the resulting line-out awarded to them.\n\nPenalty kick\n\nIf a side commits a \"penalty\" infringement the opposition can take the option of a \"place kick\" at goal from where the infringement occurred (or, if the offence occurred when a player was in the process of kicking the ball, the non-offending team can opt to take the kick from where the ball landed which may be more advantageous). This is called a penalty kick. If successful, it is worth three points.\n\nPenalty try\n\nA penalty try awarded if the referee believes a team illegally prevented a try from probably being scored. As of 2018, penalty tries score an immediate seven points, with no conversion having to be taken. Generally a penalty try is awarded when the try-preventing offence cannot be easily attributed to a single individual, such as when a team repeatedly deliberately collapses a scrum near its own tryline. When the prevention of the try is due to an individual, a yellow card is a more common punishment.\n\nPhase\n\nA phase is the time a ball is in play between breakdowns. For example, first phase would be winning the ball at the lineout and passing to a centre who is tackled. Second phase would be winning the ball back from the ensuing breakdown and attacking again.\n\nPitch\n\nThe official name of a rugby playing field. Dimensions are 100m long by 70m wide.\n\nPlace kick\n\nThe place kick is a kicking style commonly used when kicking for \"goal\". It typically involves placing the ball on the ground. To keep the ball in position, a mound of sand or plastic tee is sometimes used.\n\nPop pass\n\nA very short \"pass\".\n\nProfessional foul\n\nA professional foul is a deliberate act of foul play, usually to prevent an opponent scoring. It is punishable by a yellow card.\n\nProp\n\nThey are the players wearing shirts number 1 & 3. The role of both the props is to support the hooker in the scrum and to provide support for the jumpers in the line-out. The props provide the main power in the push forward in the scrum. For this reason they need to be exceptionally big and strong.\n\nRed card\n\nIn International matches, red cards are shown by the referee to players who have been ordered off the pitch, which results in the player being removed from the game without being replaced. This usually occurs when a player is guilty of serious foul play, or violent conduct or for committing two offences resulting in cautions (yellow cards).\n\nRed cards are also commonly used in non-international matches in precisely the same manner as in International matches but there is no regulation requiring their use. (i.e. in a domestic match, a referee may dismiss a player without actually displaying a red card.)\n\nRed zone\n\nThis is a term most commonly used by coaches to describe the area of the pitch between the try line and around 22 metres out, in which it is most likely a try may be scored or conceded.\n\nRestart\n\nThe kick taken from the centre line after the opposition have scored points.\n\nRound the corner kicking\n\nA style of place-kicking in which the kicker, instead of facing directly toward the goal-posts, approaches the ball from an angle and swings his kicking leg in an arc.\n\nRuck\n\nA ruck is formed when the ball is on the ground and two opposing players meet over the ball. The offside line becomes the last foot of the last man on each side of the ruck and players compete for the ball by attempting to drive one another from the area and to 'ruck' the ball backwards with their feet.\n\nRucks commonly form soon after tackles, but can form anywhere in the field of play where the ball is on the ground.\n\nHandling the ball while it is in the vicinity of a ruck is a penalty offence. (Though modern practice allows a player on the ground to support the ball with his/her hands and for the player who is acting as scrum half to 'dig' for the ball once possession has been secured.)\n\nIf the ball remains contested and does not come out of a ruck after about five seconds, the referee will award a scrum to the team he considers to have been moving forward in the ruck.\n\nScrum\n\nThe eight forwards from each team bind together and push against each other. The scrum-half from the team that has been awarded possession feeds the ball into the centre of the scrum from the side most advantageous for his hooker (which is typically the side of loose head prop).\n\nThe ball must be fed straight down the middle of the tunnel and the hookers must not contest for the ball until it is put in. If they do, a free-kick is awarded for \"foot up\".\n\nThe scrum is taken again if the ball comes straight out of the tunnel or if it collapses. If the scrum wheels (rotates) due to pushing more than 90 degrees the scrum is reformed and awarded to the other side. Pulling in an attempt to unbalance the other side or to assist in rotating the scrum is a Penalty Offence.\n\nScrum half\n\nAlso known as a half-back (especially in New Zealand), they are the players traditionally wearing shirt number 9. Scrum halves form the all-important link between the forwards and the backs. They are relatively small but with a high degree of vision, the ability to react to situations very quickly, and good handling skills.\n\nThey are often the first tackler in defence and are behind every scrum, maul or ruck to get the ball out and maintain movement. They put the ball into the scrum and collect it afterwards. Scrum halves generally also act as \"receiver\" in the line-out to catch the ball knocked down by the forwards. (The receiver is a member of the line-out and so stands within 10 metres of it and may join the line once the ball is thrown.)\n\nSelector\n\nA person who is delegated with the task of choosing players for a team. Typically the term is used in the context of team selection for a national, county, state or provincial representative side, where the selector, or \"selection panel\", act under the authority of the relevant national or provincial administrative body.\n\nSet piece\n\nCollective term for the scrum, line-out and sometimes the restart.\n\nShoeing\n\nAt the \"breakdown\" a \"ruck\" commonly forms over the players involved in the tackle.\n\nWhere players who are on the ground on the opposition side of the ruck do not move away quickly enough, players on their feet may be tempted to \"help\" them move by pushing them away with their boots.\n\nThis potentially dangerous act is illegal and if done deliberately (or recklessly) may result in penalties and \"yellow\" or \"red cards\".\n\nShort arm penalty\n\nSee \"free kick\"\n\nSin bin\n\nThe notional area where a player must remain for a minimum of ten minutes after being shown a \"yellow card\". In high level games, the sin bin is monitored by the \"fourth official\".\n\nSipi Tau\n\nSipi Tau is a Tongan war dance performed by the Tonga national team before each of their international matches.\n\nSiva Tau\n\nSiva Tau is a Samoan war dance performed by the Samoa national team before each of their international matches.\n\nSpear tackle\n\nA spear tackle is a dangerous tackle in which a player is picked up by the tackler and turned so that they are upside down. The tackler then drops or drives the player into the ground often head, neck or shoulder first.\n\nSpear tackles are particularly dangerous and have caused serious injury including spinal damage, dislocations and broken bones in the shoulder or neck. On rare occasion, even death can occur.\n\nSpear tackles are taken very seriously by the various Union discipline committees and can result in lengthy playing bans.\n\nStellenbosch Laws\n\nThe Stellenbosch Laws were a set of experimental laws of rugby union considered by World Rugby, then known as the International Rugby Board (IRB), from 2006 through 2008. The trials ended in late 2008, with the IRB choosing to adopt roughly half of the proposed changes.\n\nTackle\n\nA tackle takes place when one or more opposition players [tackler(s)] grasp onto the ball carrier and succeed in bringing/pulling him/her to ground and holding them there.\n\nOnce briefly held, the tackler(s) must release the tackled player who must then him/herself immediately release or attempt to pass the ball so that play can continue.\n\nTap kick\n\nA tap kick is a type of kick used by players at penalties or free kicks to meet the regulation that requires the ball must be kicked a visible distance before a player may pass or run with it.\n\nIn a tap kick, the player momentarily releases the ball from his hands and taps it with his foot or lower leg and then quickly catches it again. The player will then generally try to run forward with the ball.\n\nTap-tackle\n\nDespite its name, a tap tackle is a not actually a tackle as the ball carrier is brought to ground by a form of trip, is not actually held on the ground and may attempt to get up and continue to run. A tap tackle is used when a defending player is unable to get close enough to the ball carrier but is able to dive at the other player's feet and, with outstretched arm, deliver a tap or hook to the player's foot (or feet) causing the player to stumble. At speed, this will often be sufficient to bring the ball-carrier down, allowing a team-mate of the tackling player to retrieve the ball or provide sufficient delay for the defending team to organise a defence.\n\nTen Metre Law\n\nThe Ten Metre Law is a form of offside which is designed to prevent injury to a defending player who attempts to catch a ball that has been kicked ahead by the attacking side.\n\nIn the normal Law of Offside in open play, it is possible for an offside player to be put onside by actions of the opposing team. This ability to be put onside by a member of the opposing team does not apply if the offside player was within 10 metres along the field of a defending player waiting to catch the ball and the offside player remains offside until either he/she retreats onside or is put onside by a member of their own team.\n\nTest match\n\nInternational rugby union matches with full (Test) status are called Test matches.\n\nTight Head\n\nThe tight head prop is the player who takes the right-hand position on the front row of the \"scrum\". A tight head prop traditionally wears the number 3 shirt. He is named the tight head since in the scrum he will have an opposition player bind to both his left- and right-hand sides, meaning his head is unexposed to the side of the scrum, as opposed to the loose head, whose left-hand side is exposed.\n\nTMO\n\nTelevision match official (TMO), commonly called the video referee.\n\nTouch\n\nTouch is the area outside and including the two touch-lines which define the sides of the playing area. As the touch-lines are not part of the playing area they are part of touch. The ball, and players carrying the ball, are not considered to be in touch until they touch the floor.\nTouch judge\n\nThe touch judge is an official who monitors the touch-line and raises a flag if the ball (or player carrying it) goes into touch. Touch judges also stand behind the posts to confirm that a goal has been scored following a penalty kick or conversion of a try.\n\nTruck and trailer\n\nA colloquial term for an accidental obstruction. \"Truck and trailer\" occurs when a player carrying the ball leaves a maul, along with one or more of his teammates. Once the ball carrier leaves the maul, the maul is over, and if the ball carrier's teammates are in front of the ball carrier and prevent defending players from making a tackle, the defending team will be awarded a scrum. If the incident of truck and trailer is judged to be deliberate or the latest in a series of similar infringements, a penalty may be awarded instead.\n\nTry\n\nThis is the primary method of scoring. A try is worth five points. It is scored when a player places the ball on the ground with \"downward pressure\" in the in-goal area between (and including) the goal-line and up to but not including dead ball line of the opposition's half. (As the goal posts and post protectors are also part of the goal-line, touching the ball down against the base of these is also a try.)\n\nThere is no such thing as an \"own try\". If you touch the ball down in your own in-goal area, it results in a twenty-two metre drop out or a five-metre \"scrum\".\n\nTunnel\n\nWhen a \"scrum\" is formed, the gap between the legs of the three players from each team who form the 'front row' is called the 'tunnel'.\n\nTurnover\n\nWhen a team concedes possession of the ball, particularly at the breakdown, they are said to have turned the ball over to the other team. This can happen due to defending players stealing the ball from an isolated attacker, \"counter rucking\", a \"knock on\", an intercepted pass or the ball not emerging from a maul (wherein the referee awards the scrum feed to the opposing team).\n\nTwenty two metre drop-out\n\nA drop kick is taken from behind the 22m line if a team touches down in its own in-goal area but did not carry the ball over the try line, or if the ball is kicked over the dead ball line from any other play other than the kick-off.\n\nThe ball only needs to cross the line, but if it goes directly into touch a scrum is awarded to the receiving team at the centre-point of the 22m line.\n\nUncontested scrum\n\nScrum in which, due to absence of key specialist forwards through injuries or yellow cards, the safety of the scrum cannot be guaranteed. In an uncontested scrum, the players form a scrum but the two teams do not push against each other or compete for possession.\n\nUp and under\n\nAn up and under or a Garryowen kick, is a high short punt onto or behind the defending team.\n\nUse it or lose it\n\nIf a maul stops moving forward the referee will often shout \"use it or lose it\" to the team in possession of the ball. This means they must pass the ball within a five-second time period. If they do not, the referee will call a scrum and the team not in possession at the beginning of the maul will be given the feed.\n\nVideo Referee\n\nAlso called TMO (Television Match Official). This is the official who monitors the match in television recorded matches. He is the person who could be called upon by the referee if he is unaware of the outcome of a rugby situation. A good example is a try that is obscured from view i.e. under numerous players.\n\nWheeling\n\nA scrum that has rotated through 90 degrees or more is said to have \"wheeled\". The referee will order the scrum to be reset, with the ball being turned over if the attacking team is deemed to have been deliberately or repeatedly wheeling the scrum.\n\nWing\n\nThe players wearing shirts numbers 11 and 14 are the left and right wingers. Wingers must be fast runners and agile in order to evade tackles and have excellent ball-handling skills in order to pass and receive the ball at pace.\n\nYellow Card\n\nIn International matches, a yellow card is shown to a player who has been cautioned to indicate \"temporary suspension\" for repeated or deliberate infringements of the rules. The offending player is sent to the “sin bin” for at least 10 minutes while his team must play a man short. A player who is temporarily suspended cannot return to the pitch until the first break in play after his/her 10-minute suspension is completed.\n\nIn domestic matches, yellow cards are commonly used in exactly the same manner as in International matches but this is not required by regulation so a referee may order the temporary suspension of a player without showing a yellow card.\n\n"}
{"id": "1922866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922866", "title": "Harder Stadium", "text": "Harder Stadium\n\nHarder Stadium is a 17,000 seat, outdoor multi-purpose stadium on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara in Santa Barbara, California. It serves as the on-campus soccer stadium for both the men's and women's programs. It is also currently used occasionally by the university's club rugby and lacrosse teams and previously served as the home for the football team.\n\nThe stadium was built in 1966 and is named after Theodore \"Spud\" Harder, a former coach of the Gauchos' football team. It hosted Vince Lombardi and the Green Bay Packers who trained there ahead of the 1967 Super Bowl. The UC-Santa Barbara football team played their home games at Harder Stadium until football was cut after the 1972 season due to budget cuts. UCSB brought football back as a non-scholarship sport in 1983 and by 1987 was playing a full Division II and III schedule. In 1992, the NCAA ruled that Division I colleges must play at the Division I level in all sports; UCSB and a few other universities attempted to form a non-scholarship Division I-AAA level, but the effort failed and UCSB eventually dropped football. The stadium has a capacity of 17,000 people, and currently is the largest stadium on California's Central Coast. Along with the UCSB Events Center, it is one of the more well-attended athletic venues in the Central Coast.\n\nHarder Stadium hosted a memorial service for the victims of the 2014 Isla Vista Killings. Guests in attendance included UC President Janet Napolitano, and over 20,000 students, staff, alumni, and community members. The stadium seats were filled over capacity as thousands more sat on the grass field. \n\nHarder Stadium sees most of its present-day use as a soccer stadium to the UCSB men's soccer and women's soccer teams. The stadium hosted the final three matches of the 2010 College Cup. However, a number of professional club and international teams have played in Harder Stadium as well.\n\nDue to the success of the men's program, the stadium has hosted numerous NCAA soccer playoff games in addition to the regular season games. Despite the men's program recent success, it was the women's program who first brought the NCAA Tournaments to Harder Stadium. The women hosted the first soccer NCAA Tournament game in a 1985 4-3 victory against Cal State Hayward. In total, the women's program has held 4 NCAA Tournament matches at Harder Stadium, bringing such opponents as the Wisconsin Badgers, Stanford Cardinal, and Hartford Hawks.\n\nThe men's program hosted their first men's NCAA Tournament game in 2002, blanking the San Diego Toreros 2-0. In total, they have hosted 9 NCAA Tournament games.\n\nIn 2004, 11,214 fans saw UCSB defeat Virginia Commonwealth 4-1 to reach the College Cup (NCAA Soccer's \"Final Four\"). After the game, a group of students celebrated by carrying one of the soccer goals out of the stadium. They had planned to throw it into the Pacific Ocean (about 1/3 mile away), but were stopped by a combination of law enforcement down the block and tiring out from the weight of the goal.\n\nHowever, in 2006, the UCSB won the 2006 Division I Men's College Cup in St. Louis, Missouri. Meanwhile, 2,000 miles away at Harder Stadium, a group of rowdy students marched down to the stadium from their homes and attempted the same feat. This time the group succeeded in their quest, throwing the soccer goal off of a cliff at the beginning of the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive.\n\nIn 2009, the NCAA awarded UCSB and Harder Stadium the 2010 Division I Men's College Cup, which is the \"Final Four\" of Division I men's soccer.\n\nOn September 24, 2010, the UCSB gaucho fans set a record on the highest attendance at any NCAA (on campus) soccer match. UCSB beat the visiting UCLA team (2-0) in front of 15,896 who attended the game.\n\nAdditional UCSB teams that use the stadium for select contests are the UCSB women's lacrosse, men's lacrosse and rugby teams. These teams are part of the UCSB Recreation Department and open to all students.\n\nDue to the large capacity of Harder Stadium, it is often used by professional teams exhibition games. In 1991, the US Women's National Team played there before the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Likewise, the US Men's National Team played there in 1994 against the Romanian National Team.\n\nClub teams also have played at Harder Stadium. In March 2004, the San Jose Earthquakes and Los Angeles Galaxy played a pre-season exhibition in Santa Barbara. Following the success of MLS teams at Harder, in March 2006 & 2007, the UC Santa Barbara men's team played exhibition matches against the Columbus Crew while in July 2006, Cruz Azul and Los Angeles Galaxy played. March 2007 also saw Shizuoka Sangyō University of Japan played off against UCSB. March 2009 saw Club América and Monarcas Morelia played, while UCSB has scheduled to play the Mexican U-17 National Team.\n\nEvery year, the school's Associated Students Program Board have thrown a free day-long party, known as EXTRAVAGANZA, at Harder Stadium. Previous bands to have played at the festival include Sublime, No Doubt, Jack Johnson, T.I., Run-D.M.C., Coolio, Busta Rhymes, The Black Eyed Peas, Jane's Addiction, MxPx, Social Distortion, Eve 6, Pepper, Slightly Stoopid, Ludacris, Nas, Hellogoodbye, and E-40.\n\nHarder Stadium also houses 18 art studios located beneath the seating risers. They are primarily used by graduate students and faculty.\n\n"}

{"id": "19474583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19474583", "title": "Jock Wadley", "text": "Jock Wadley\n\nJohn Borland (Jock) Wadley (1914 – March 1981) was an English journalist whose magazines and reporting opened Continental cycle racing to fans in Britain.\nWadley covered 18 Tours de France from 1956. He worked for the British weekly, \"The Bicycle\" and then started and edited the monthlies \"Coureur\" (later \"Sporting Cyclist\") and \"International Cycle Sport\". He also wrote a number of books.\n\nWadley began cycling with the Colchester Rovers club when he was 14. He and a friend, Alf Kettle, were between the towns of Kelvedon and Coggeshall when they took a wrong turning into a farm track by moonlight, riding by the light of acetylene lamps. Kettle called Wadley \"Willy\", because it was what all new members were called. He said it was \"like the Tour de France\". It was the first time Wadley had heard of the race, which was still in the era of daily stages that started at dawn and rode on unsurfaced roads. He wanted to know more.\nHe went to the world track championships in Paris when he was 19 and came home starry-eyed over riders like Jeff Scherens and Lucien Michard. He ordered the daily paper \"L'Auto\", which organised the Tour, from a newsagent in Colchester. The man warned him it cost 1½d (1p or about 3 US cents) and that the cost was extravagant.\n\nWadley joined \"The Bicycle\" soon after it started, in February 1936, and became the magazine's foreign correspondent. The paper opened in opposition to \"Cycling\", to counter \"Cycling\"s perceived establishment views, which included not covering massed racing on the open road after the Second World War and giving what some readers saw as little attention to professional cycling, such as the Tour de France. \"Cycling\" was originally dismissive of a breakaway organisation, the British League of Racing Cyclists and campaigned against it and did little to cover its races; \"The Bicycle\" saw itself as neither for or against the BLRC but saw massed-start racing an exciting part of cycle-racing. \"The Bicycle\" appeared on Tuesday rather than the Friday of its rival.\n\nWadley translated reports in French and Belgian papers, and cuttings sent by the magazine's correspondent at L'Auto and cycled around the Continent reporting the races he saw and writing accounts of the riders he had met. Adrian Bell, the British publisher who compiled a collection of Wadley's work, wrote:\n\nAnd so began a pattern of working life and, with it, a unique style of writing about cycling that Wadley was to maintain, to a greater or lesser extent, for more than 20 years. When not required for race-reporting duties in England, he would load the panniers of his bicycle – spare clothes and maps in one, a portable typewriter in the other – and take to the roads of France, Belgium Holland. Whatever the route, it was of his choosing. And back would come the reports – of major Tours, French classics, frenetic kermesses over the Belgian pavé, or six-day dramas on the steep banking of indoor velodromes – or interviews with current riders or with those whose exploits had once made cycling history, or simply touring features that depicted the appealing variety of the terrain through which he travelled. During one two-month tour in the spring of 1954, he submitted 3,000 words a week; there was simply nothing like it in the English cycling press.\n\nWadley left the magazine two years later and joined the press department of the bicycle maker, Hercules, which was sponsoring prominent British riders to break long-distance records. From there he was conscripted into the services at the start of the Second World War.\n\nWith the return of peace, he became one of three press officers for the sport's governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale when the Olympic Games were held in London in 1948. He then rejoined \"The Bicycle\" and stayed until it closed in 1955. That year he started work on a monthly magazine, initially called \"Coureur\" but then, because a magazine with a similar title already existed, \"Sporting Cyclist\".\n\nWadley recalled of his redundancy: \"I saw more cycling... than in four far-from-dull years on \"The Bicycle\". As the programme included my first all-the-way Tour de France, I had enough material in hand to write a book... The dream, however, was to bring out a continental-style all-cycling magazine.\"\n\nIn late 1956, Wadley secured the backing of the publisher Charles Buchan, former football captain of Arsenal and England, who wanted a companion to his magazine, \"Football Monthly\". Wadley told Buchan that he had a proposal which would never make him rich but wouldn't disgrace him, an approach so novel that Buchan was interested from the start. Issue number one was written by Wadley, who had also taken most of the photographs. It was produced at the home of Peter Bryan, Wadley's editor at \"The Bicycle\", with help from a photographer, Bill Lovelace, and a designer, Glenn Steward. They too had worked at \"The Bicycle\".\n\n\"Sporting Cyclist\" introduced Continental racing through the Franco-American writer, René de Latour. His role was \"friend of the stars\", providing insights into Continental racing at a time when \"Cycling\" concentrated on domestic issues.\n\nThe cycle parts importer and advertiser, Ron Kitching, wrote:\n\nThis was a real innovation and an instant success. It was filled with exciting stories of both home and overseas events, written not only by Jock himself but also by the top cycling writers of the day – like René de Latour, Harry Aspden, Charles Ruys and Dick Snowden, Geoffrey Nicholson and David Saunders.\n\nThe last edition was in April 1968, volume 12, number 4. \"Sporting Cyclist\" was by then owned by Longacre Press, which had bought Buchan's publications. Longacre also published \"Cycling\" and the two merged. The assistant editor, Roy Green, who had joined in 1960, left \"Sporting Cyclist\" to join \"Amateur Photographer\".\n\nWadley set up another magazine, \"International Cycle Sport\", which after 199 issues in 17 years also failed, by which time Wadley's contract as editor had long since not been renewed.\n\n\"International Cycle Sport\" was the idea of Kennedy Brothers, a printing company in Keighley, Yorkshire owned by three brothers. It was the first English-language cycling magazine printed in colour, with a colour cover and several colour pages inside. The contents were those which would have appeared in the next \"Sporting Cyclist\". Wadley's assistant editor, John Wilcockson, said: \"We were thrilled with the first issue that came off the presses, even though the colour reproduction was pretty awful.\" One of the pictures, of the Belgian rider Patrick Sercu was printed the wrong way round.\n\nWadley wrote in his first leading article:\n\nI had launched [Sporting Cyclist] because I knew the cycling world wanted it. There was never any suggestion that it would make a lot of money for anybody. Yet within a few years, after a series of mergers and takeovers, \"Sporting Cyclist\" found itself under the control of a giant publishing organisation whose business, understandably, was to make money. A small monthly magazine supported by what it considered to be a \"dying industry\" was obviously of little interest to such a concern, and its eventual merger with \"Cycling\" was simply a matter of time. When the decision was taken I and my most able assistant Roy Green were given the chance of carrying on with the combined publication, but neither accepted the offer.\n\nThe magazine was produced in a basement office in Kingston upon Thames Surrey, rented from Maurice Cumberworth, race director of the Milk Race. Kennedy Brothers, however, failed and a receiver passed its assets to another Yorkshire printer, Peter Fretwell. The magazine was among the assets. Fretwell's company was also struggling and the receiver hoped to make one strong company out of two weak ones.\n\nWilcockson said:\n\nPeter Fretwell was a tough-minded businessman, the antithesis of the mild-mannered Wadley. The two men didn't get on... The arrangement worked for a while, but Fretwell soon decided that he could do without Wadley. I was prepared to go too, but my 'father' [Wadley] said no... Well, within a year, I was fired too.\n\nAdrian Bell wrote:\n\nSo the saying goes, you can never walk the same road twice. \"ICS\" was not \"Sporting Cyclist\" in full-colour guise. In the first place it never had the same breadth of coverage. Secondly, not only was it more narrowly focused, it contained fewer articles, and they were mainly written by professional journalists. In its text and the use of full-page colour photography, it was closer to a contemporary monthly cycling journal; it was never a diary written by clubmen for clubmen.\n\nJock Wadley covered 18 Tours de France not only for his magazine but for the London Daily Telegraph. The paper then decided to send its specialist cycling reporter, David Saunders. Until then Saunders had not wanted to spend a month of each summer away from home.\n\nThe new arrangement ended Wadley's newspaper career and halted the occasional contributions he made to BBC Radio, where he reported on noisy short-wave and telephone links from races such as the world championship and Bordeaux–Paris, a race from which he reported the victory of the British rider, Tom Simpson.\n\nIt also ended Wadley's habit of following the Tour in the car of French journalist colleagues and he covered his 19th Tour by bike and wrote a book called \"My Nineteenth Tour de France\".\n\nHis years at the Tour de France earned him the race's medal. He received it from the organisers Jacques Goddet and Félix Lévitan at Carpentras in 1970. For many years he had been the only permanent English-speaking reporter on the Tour and the race press officer, Louis Lapeyre, who for many years refused to speak to any anglophone journalists let alone do it in English, finally negotiated with them through Wadley.\n\nFew cyclists featured in Wadley's writing as much as Tom Simpson, the first Briton to wear the yellow jersey in the Tour de France. Wadley's first encounter with him was in 1955 while he was at a training camp in Monaco sponsored by the derailleur-maker, Simplex. The camp was run by the former Tour rider, Charles Pélissier. Wadley went there to report, specifically on a promising Irish rider called Seamus Elliott, who had won his place as a prize in the previous year's Tour of Ireland.\n\nMany cyclists unable to attend the camp wrote to Pélissier, asking his advice. Wadley translated them into French for him. One said:\n\nDear Sir, I am writing to you hoping you will give me some advice on racing and training for the 1955 season. I am 16 years old, and have raced on the track and also massed start road races, competing in between, in time trials. In my first track event I gained 3rd place, in road races I have won 2 prizes and in time trials I have won 4 prizes. My positions in time trials were 11th, 8th, 15th, 7th. I have done 25 miles in 1hr 34 seconds, which is the fastest time for a 16-year-old in England this year.\n\nI would like to know, if you think it is advisable to compete in so many different events, and also what greatest mileage I should race. I have been told that if I race often, I will burn myself out, and will be no good when I get older, do you think this is true. Yours in sport, Thomas Simpson, HARWORTH & DIST. C.C.\n\nThere is no evidence of a reply from Pélissier, who didn't speak English, although Wadley suggested in \"Sporting Cyclist\" in 1965 that he may have done.\n\nMartin Ayres, one of several who wrote their first articles for Sporting Cyclist and went on to edit cycling magazines of their own, said that Wadley's discursive, first-person style looked simple but \"I tried to copy Jock's style once or twice when I was editor of \"Cycling\", but when I did it, it just seemed like name-dropping.'\n\nAdrian Bell wrote:\n\nThis consistent use of the first person in his articles is crucial to understanding the appeal of his writing. Regardless of whether he was composing an account of a race, interviewing an old-time, retired cyclist, or describing a leisurely tour, he always used this technique. Events were not reported as if they were simple objective facts, nor were they sensationalised; always we saw them through his eyes and ears. He offered us his thoughts, his emotions and his immediate impressions at the moment of their happening, and if those impressions needed to be revised in the light of later revelations, he did that, too, and explained why... Good letter-writers, so they say, are basically good conversationalists and, by all accounts, J. B. Wadley was certainly that.\n\nWadley always rode in Hush Puppy shoes, which he said hurt his feet less than conventional cycling shoes. He rode long distances both in races such as 24-hour time-trials – he rode just short of 400 miles in the North Road event when he was 59 – and outside competition. His first book, \"My 19th Tour de France\", starts: \"I had practised and thoroughly enjoyed what I had for so long been preaching. Instead of lazing 3,000 miles in a press car, I had pedalled 1,750 on a bike. Instead of scribbling 400 words a night and phoning them through to Fleet Street, I have taken my time in writing 90,000 and sent them to the printers.\"\n\nHis fondness for France led him to join the Union Sportif at Créteil, in the Paris suburbs. That led to his riding the 1,200 km challenge, Paris–Brest–Paris, which he recorded in another book, \"Old Roads and New\". His writing inspired riders around the world. In Britain it led to the creation of Audax UK to provide a means for British riders to take part. In Canada said the long-distance enthusiast Eric Fergusson:\n\nHere in British Columbia, \"Brestward Ho!\" [title of the chapter recounting Paris–Brest–Paris] did indeed make its mark. After reading the story, local cycling legend John Hathaway committed to ride the Audax version of PBP in 1976. While in France, he met the randonneur PBP organiser Robert Lepertel and was persuaded to come back for the next randonneur PBP in 1979. Three years later Hathaway returned to France with fellow randonneur pioneers Dan McGuire, Gerry Pareja, and Wayne Phillips to participate in (and complete!) PBP '79 marking the birth of randonneur cycling in British Columbia, and indeed, in Canada.\n\nThere was a celebration marking the 25th anniversary of BC Randonneurs at the club's annual general meeting in September 2003. At this event Gerry Pareja... held up a copy of \"Old Roads and New\". With the \"Brestward Ho!\" chapter in mind Gerry suggested that: 'This book probably had more to do with getting English-speaking cyclists to become interested in PBP than anything else written about it.' \n\nWadley rode the Brevet des Randonneurs des Alpes, a mountain challenge, in 1973. It was run as a time-trial over the col de Glandon, the Croix de Fer, the Telegraphe and the Galibier. The race started in Grenoble at 2 am. Wadley had hoped to meet Pierre Brambilla, who lost the Tour de France on the last day in 1947. He was attacked, against a tradition that the race leader would be left to ride to Paris in glory, by the Frenchman Jean Robic. Wadley had met Brambilla but never remembered to ask the truth of the story that he was so upset by his defeat that he buried his bike in his garden.\n\nGraeme Fife wrote: \"Brambilla caught Wadley on the approach to the Galibier. Wadley thought the Italian veteran (now 53 years old) would have been miles ahead, but he'd overslept and set out an hour late. He offered to give Wadley a tow up the Galibier; Wadley declined and Brambilla flew off. Wadley remembered the buried bicycle story and called out, but too late... the chance to confirm or scotch missed.\" \n\nWadley remained disillusioned at the closure of \"Sporting Cyclist\" – \"the only time I saw him angry\", said Peter Bryan – and at being fired from \"International Cycle Sport\" and at the mixed success of his book-publishing venture. He died in March 1981 and his ashes were scattered on the col du Glandon in the Alps. His widow, Mary, had asked that his ashes be scattered on the route of the Tour.\n\nThey were taken by a group of readers led by the British enthusiast, Neville Chanin. They scattered them on Bastille Day during the Tour de France. Chanin wrote:\n\nPeter Bryan said: \"Wadley's beautiful turn of phrase could be applied equally to a touring theme or race report, and he carried you, the reader, along with him as though you were riding and hearing his words borne from the front saddle.\"\n\nRon Kitching said:\n\nHe wasn't ruthless enough to be a businessman, he just floated through life absorbing the cycling scene and reflecting it in his articles and books. I don't think Jock ever worked as such, he just put down in words what his thoughts were. Jock was a real gentleman but he did tend to wander off. We were sponsoring the Tour of the North and \"International Cycle Sport\" was one of the sponsors. He turned up on his bike, just pottering about. He seemed more interested in riding his bike than covering the race. Which was his downfall, really.\n\nAn annual road race is held near Colchester each summer in Wadley's memory. Wadley had been president of the Colchester Rovers. A collection of his writing was published in 2002: \"From the pen of J. B. Wadley\", ed: Adrian Bell, Mousehold Press, Norwich.\n"}

{"id": "41245898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41245898", "title": "Kick Six", "text": "Kick Six\n\nThe Kick Six (also known as Kick Bama Kick) was the final play of the 78th Iron Bowl college football game played on November 30, 2013 at Jordan–Hare Stadium in Auburn, Alabama. The game featured No. 1-ranked and two-time defending national champion Alabama Crimson Tide (11–0, 7–0 in the SEC) as a 10-point favorite over the No. 4-ranked Auburn Tigers (10–1, 6–1 in the SEC). The Iron Bowl was fiercely contested in 2013 with both teams ranked in the top 5 and a berth in the 2013 SEC Championship Game and, potentially, the national championship game at stake. However, this game was particularly notable for its ending.\n\nAfter falling behind in the 2nd quarter and then again in the 4th, Auburn rallied late to tie the game at 28–28 with 32 seconds remaining. After the ensuing kickoff, Alabama quickly moved to the Auburn 38 yard line, at which point the clock ran out, seemingly sending the game to overtime. Alabama coach Nick Saban challenged the timekeeping call, and after a video review, one second was put back on the clock, and the Crimson Tide lined up for a potential game winning 57-yard field goal. The kick was short, and Auburn's Chris Davis, who had been positioned near the goal line, caught the ball just in front of the goal posts. Davis ran across the entire field through players from both teams to the opposite end zone, improbably scoring the winning touchdown for Auburn on the last play of the game. Though the runback was technically about 109 yards, it is officially considered a 100 yard return according to NCAA rules, and it tied LSU's Odell Beckham Jr.'s record-setting 100 yard return that same season.\n\nThe game, which was televised by CBS, posted an 11.8 television rating during the final half-hour, which was the highest rating ever achieved during a college football broadcast at that time. Some sports writers argued that Davis' play was the single greatest moment in college football history.\n\nThe two teams came into the game after very different 2012 seasons. Despite an upset at the hands of Texas A&M, the Crimson Tide ultimately finished as SEC Champions after a close game against the Georgia Bulldogs and went on to soundly defeat Notre Dame 42–14 for their second consecutive national title, their third in four years. Meanwhile, two years after their own National Championship, the Auburn Tigers suffered through their worst season in 60 years, finishing 3–9 with an abysmal 0–8 SEC record, capped by a 49–0 loss to Alabama in the 2012 Iron Bowl–their second consecutive blowout loss on the Iron Bowl. Head coach Gene Chizik was fired in favor of Arkansas State coach Gus Malzahn.\n\nAlabama entered the season ranked #1 and remained at the top of the polls for the entire season, rolling through their schedule with relative ease; they won all but one of their games by more than 10 points. Auburn, on the other hand, entered the season unranked and didn't enter the AP Poll until the midpoint of the season. Auburn's season was defined by a series of come-from-behind wins and miraculous plays. Auburn defeated Mississippi State in September on a late touchdown pass. The following month, No. 24 Auburn came from behind to beat No. 7 Texas A&M and Johnny Manziel. With that win, Auburn surged all the way to No. 11 in both major polls. \n\nTwo weeks before the Iron Bowl, No. 7 Auburn defeated rival Georgia with a miraculous tipped Hail Mary pass known as the \"Prayer at Jordan–Hare.\", setting the stage for a highly ranked Iron Bowl matchup.\n\nAlabama was predicted by analysts to conclude the 2013–14 season with a BCS record third straight national title, their fourth in five years. The winner of the previous four Iron Bowls (2009–2012) went on to win the national championship: Alabama in 2009, 2011, and 2012; and Auburn in 2010. Entering the 2013 Iron Bowl, with Alabama and Auburn ranked No. 1 and No. 4 respectively in the BCS standings, this was only the second matchup in the rivalry to feature two Top 5 teams, and the highest-ranked Iron Bowl ever. On November 27, 1971, No. 3 Alabama faced No. 5 Auburn at Legion Field in Birmingham, both teams undefeated. Alabama was also undefeated in the last three years and 24 days in games played outside of their home field in Tuscaloosa, their last loss prior to those 18 consecutive road victories coming on November 6, 2010 at LSU.\n\nWith Alabama favored by 10 points, Auburn was a decided underdog in the eyes of most analysts. Marq Burnett of \"The Anniston Star\" went as far as to list seven reasons why Auburn could not beat Alabama including Alabama's tough run defense and unstoppable offense, even the superior coaching skills of Nick Saban over Gus Malzahn. Joel Erickson of \"The Birmingham News\" was one of the few writers to pick Auburn, predicting a score of 31–28. Similar predictions were shared during ESPN's \"College GameDay\", which was broadcast live from outside Jordan–Hare Stadium prior to the game. The program's panel of Kirk Herbstreit, David Pollack, and Lee Corso, as well as Paul Finebaum, unanimously picked Alabama to win the game. Auburn alumnus and \"NBA on TNT\" personality Charles Barkley, who appeared as a special guest, went against the panel and chose Auburn to win the game.\n\n\nAlabama received the opening kickoff and drove to the Auburn 34-yard line, but missed a 44-yard field goal. Auburn's opening drive netted 20 yards and no points. Alabama was then held to seven yards, going three-and-out. Auburn then capped off a seven-play, 66-yard drive with a 45-yard touchdown run by Nick Marshall. It was the Tigers' first offensive touchdown against Alabama since 2010. The quarter ended with Auburn leading 7–0.\n\nAlabama scored touchdowns on their first three possessions of the second quarter, with the first two on scoring passes by AJ McCarron; the first was a 67-yard drive, the second was 36 yards, and the third drive covered 56 yards. Alabama had scored 21 unanswered points. But Auburn scored late in the second quarter on a Tre Mason run, and the Crimson Tide led, 21–14, at the half.\n\nUnder Saban, Alabama had a record of 73–3 when leading at halftime. Auburn received the kickoff in the second half and drove 69 yards to tie the game, 21–21. Later in the quarter Alabama drove 88 yards to Auburn's 11 before the 3rd quarter came to a close.\n\nAlabama's drive came to a halt following two incomplete passes, and a false start penalty that moved the offense back five yards, nullifying the first successful field goal attempt of the game. The Crimson Tide then missed their second field goal of the game. Later in the quarter an Auburn punt was downed at the Alabama 1-yard line. McCarron then threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper, giving Alabama a 28–21 lead with 10:28 remaining in the game. It was the longest pass play in Crimson Tide football history. With 2:41 left in the game, and trailing 28–21, Auburn drove to the Alabama 39 in six plays.\n\nWith 32 seconds remaining, the Tigers scored on a 39-yard touchdown pass from Marshall to Sammie Coates. On the ensuing possession, with seven seconds left in the game, Alabama ran to Auburn's 38-yard line as T. J. Yeldon was knocked out of bounds by Chris Davis while the game clock expired. But Saban argued that Yeldon had stepped out of bounds with one second left in regulation. Saban's argument was validated by the instant replay officials, who put one second back on the clock. Rather than take a knee and go to overtime, Alabama attempted to win the game with a 57-yard field goal and Auburn took a timeout. Auburn's defensive coordinator, Ellis Johnson, doubted Alabama would make the long field goal and suggested that a defensive back stand in the end zone with the potential to return a missed field goal. Malzahn then put Davis, who doubled as Auburn's punt returner, in the end zone for the return in the event of a miss. As the field goal attempt fell short, Davis fielded the ball nine yards deep in the end zone and ran down the sideline. With Alabama's field goal unit being made up mostly of offensive linemen, Davis ran all the way to the end zone to win the game 34–28. It was unofficially the longest missed field goal return in NCAA history, tying a 109-yard return earlier in the 2013 season by Odell Beckham of LSU. However, he was only credited with 100 yards; unlike the NFL, the NCAA does not count yardage inside the end zone for kick returns.\n\nThe crowd reaction registered on seismographs across the state of Alabama, in a manner similar to activity registered during the 1988 Auburn–LSU \"Earthquake Game\".\n\nLundquist's call of the last play:\nGary Danielson would later compare the game to the legendary Miracle on Ice, equating Auburn's upset of Alabama to the amateur USA hockey team defeating the powerhouse Soviet Union team during the 1980 Winter Olympics. Danielson commented on the moment stating \"I just think it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing and I'm very proud to have been a part of it.\"\nBramblett's call of the last play:\n\nGold's call of the last play:\nAlabama failed to score on six of their last seven drives as they lost their first road game in over three years. Alabama also missed 4 field goals in the game.\n\nMcCarron finished with 277 yards passing and three touchdowns for the Crimson Tide while Auburn's Marshall completed 11 passes for 97 yards and two touchdowns, rushing for 99 yards and a third touchdown. Neither quarterback threw an interception.\n\nAlabama's Yeldon rushed for 141 yards and 1 touchdown while Mason amassed 164 yards and one touchdown for the Tigers, the most rushing yards for a single player against Alabama in 2013. Cooper caught six passes for 178 yards for the Crimson Tide and Auburn's Coates finished with 60 yards receiving. 39 of Coates's 60 yards came on the game-tying touchdown and 99 of Cooper's 168 yards came on the 99 yard touchdown reception in the beginning of the 4th quarter.\n\nAuburn made 22 first downs while Alabama made 19. The Tigers converted 53% of their third-down attempts while the Crimson Tide converted 31%.\n\nAuburn's win not only ended Alabama's bid for a third straight national title, but vaulted Auburn to third in the BCS standings. The Tigers beat Missouri 59-42 in the SEC Championship Game. After #2 Ohio State's defeat by Michigan State in the Big Ten Championship Game later that same day, following the SEC Championship, Auburn moved into second place and secured a place in the BCS National Championship Game, losing to the Florida State Seminoles 34–31. Auburn's loss ended the SEC's streak of seven national championships. Auburn's Gus Malzahn won the SEC Coach of the Year award and received a six-year contract extension worth $3.85m per year. Alabama's AJ McCarron and Auburn's Tre Mason were 2013 Heisman Trophy finalists, but the award was won by Florida State QB Jameis Winston. In the postseason, Alabama lost to the Oklahoma Sooners, 45–31, in the 2014 Sugar Bowl.\n\nYahoo! Sports columnist Pat Forde stated:It was, quite simply, the most astounding ending ever to a college football game. I was at the Boise State–Oklahoma Fiesta Bowl in 2007; this tops it. More at stake, and even more shock value on the final play (minus the player proposing to his girlfriend on the field). An article in \"USA Today\" described the back-to-back victories with the analogy that lightning struck twice, the Georgia game being \"one of the greatest finishes to a college football game\" and the Alabama upset \"perhaps the greatest play in college football history\". \"The Birmingham News\" called the Auburn victory their \"latest miracle finish ... even more stunning than the first.\" The \"News & Record\" called the 2013 Iron Bowl possibly \"the greatest college football game ever played.\" The website \"Sports on Earth\" ranked the Kick Six game third in their list of the best college football games of all time.\n\nAfter the game, the press identified Alabama's Achilles' heel: the kicking game. In reference to their four unsuccessful field goal attempts, writers called the game \"Kick Bama Kick,\" in reference to the 1972 Iron Bowl, nicknamed \"Punt Bama Punt\". At 6:43 p.m., just 18 minutes after of the conclusion of the game, Jon Solomon of \"The Birmingham News\" posted an article titled \"Kick Bama Kick\", but included an online poll allowing readers to select their favorite moniker. Among seven proposed titles, \"Kick Bama Kick\" won by a landslide. Ryan Black of the \"Ledger–Enquirer\" in Columbus, Georgia titled an article \"Kick, Bama, kick\" within hours of the game's completion. Frank Cooney of Yahoo! Sports, who noted that the game will be \"forever secured\" in the discussion for the most dramatic college football game in history, also titled his piece \"Kick Bama Kick\" that evening. One year after the game, \"Sports Illustrated\", CBS Sports and Fox Sports referred to it as the \"Kick Six\".\n\nThe term \"Kick Six\" is also used, in general, to refer to other instances of blocked or missed field goals being returned for a touchdown, such as one occurring in an NFL game on November 30, 2015, as performed by the Baltimore Ravens against the Cleveland Browns. The term is a play on the term \"pick six\", which refers to an interception being returned for a touchdown.\n\nAt the 2014 ESPY Awards, recognizing the greatest achievements in 2013, the 2013 Iron Bowl won the award for \"Best Game\". The other two nominees were Game Five of the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals and the Indianapolis Colts first round playoff victory.\n\nThe game-winning touchdown return was named \"Best Play\" at the 2014 ESPYs. The play beat three other nominees including the play near the end of Auburn's game against Georgia.\n\nThe crowd reaction to the game's final play registered on seismographs across the state of Alabama in a manner similar to activity registered during the 1988 Auburn–LSU \"Earthquake Game\".\n\nCremated human remains were discovered on the field inside Jordan–Hare Stadium by Auburn's grounds crew the Monday following the game, presumably left by a field-rusher who was honoring a request from a deceased relative.\n\nDuring the post-game celebration on Pat Dye Field, Auburn coach Gus Malzahn's visor was stolen by a fan. The incident was caught on camera. The thief later issued an apology, however Auburn officials never responded to his offers to return the visor. The sweater vest Malzahn wore during the game was later auctioned off for charity.\n\nA column on the game written the following week by Stanford student Winston Shi broke the single-day website traffic record for \"The Stanford Daily\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7713297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7713297", "title": "Lewisohn Stadium", "text": "Lewisohn Stadium\n\nLewisohn Stadium was an amphitheater and athletic facility built on the campus of the City College of New York. It opened in 1915 and was demolished in 1973.\n\nThe Doric-colonnaded amphitheater was built between Amsterdam and Convent Avenues, from 136th to 138th Streets, in 1915, with a capacity of 8,000. Financier and philanthropist Adolph Lewisohn donated the money for construction. The stadium hosted many athletic, musical, and theatrical events and was one of New York's public landmarks. It was demolished in 1973 to make way for the $125 million North Academic Center. \n\nThe CCNY football team played its home games at Lewisohn from 1921 to 1950; the final game played was a 33–6 Beavers victory over Lowell Textile on November 18, 1950, in front of 300 fans. (It was CCNY's only win that season, and the program was discontinued the following year.)\n\nBesides sporting events, the stadium was used for performances by Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic (sometimes called the \"Stadium Symphony Orchestra\"), Renata Tebaldi Kirsten Flagstad, Marian Anderson, Alfredo Antonini and Eugene Ormandy. Leopold Stokowski made a series of recordings for Everest with the \"Stadium Symphony Orchestra of New York.\" George Gershwin played his \"Rhapsody in Blue\". Performers ranged from Van Cliburn, Jascha Heifetz, and Yehudi Menuhin to Leontyne Price, Roberta Peters, Licia Albanese Jan Peerce, Richard Tucker, Placido Domingo, Pete Seeger, Thomas Hayward (tenor), Harry Belafonte, Jack Benny, Benny Goodman, and conductor Kurt Adler of the Metropolitan Opera. Due to declining attendances, the concerts were discontinued in 1966.\n\nThe stadium was used by City College for its commencement exercises; all CCNY campuses took part, including Liberal Arts, Engineering and Architecture, and its Manhattan Business School (now Baruch College); this continued through June1973. It was also used for CCNY's annual Army ROTC's reviews at the end of each academic year. Along with Jasper Oval (right across Convent Avenue, also now demolished), Lewisohn was used throughout the academic year for many of the college's uptown campus outdoor intramural sports.\n\nThe derelict stadium was used in the 1973 film \"Serpico\", directed by Sidney Lumet, in a scene with Tony Roberts and Al Pacino. It also appeared as the setting of the final scene of the 1945 film \"Rhapsody in Blue\" in which Oscar Levant performs the title composition, with an orchestra conducted by Paul Whiteman, as a memorial to the composer.\n\n"}

{"id": "5624911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5624911", "title": "Northlands Park", "text": "Northlands Park\n\nNorthlands Park is the \"Alberta A circuit\" horse racing track at Northlands in Edmonton, Alberta. The horse racing season generally consists of a spring harness (Standardbred) meet from February/March, a Thoroughbred meet from May/June to September/October and a fall harness meet to mid-December. Northlands Park (formerly Northlands Spectrum) is the building name for the grandstand. There are three dining areas on the second floor. Colours is the main dining room overlooking the race track and has a seating capacity of 700. Uplinks Theatre is the simulcast restaurant area and features 6 projection televisions and up to 26 different simulcast race broadcasts from North American tracks and Sha Tin in Hong Kong. Playbook Lounge is open limited hours and is available for private functions, sports broadcast events (27 televisions) and private parties. There are two other concessions on the second floor - Rock's and The Deli - that are open during live horse racing.\n\nThe track opened in 1900 to replace Rossdale Flats with upgrades in 1995 and 2005.\n\nThe Slots at Northlands Park is the main-floor slot machine gaming room and features Las Vegas-style slot machines and VLTs and has two dining areas - the Slot Lounge and the Slot Grill. \n\nThe Paddock Theatre hosts the post position draw for the Canadian Derby, Northlands Park's largest and most prestigious annual thoroughbred race. Directly outside of the Paddock Theatre is the outdoor paddock area - featuring a barbecue concession window with beer service, paddock viewing terrace and the race commentary television broadcast room.\n\nNorthlands Park was also the corporate operating name for Edmonton Northlands. The name was adopted from the race track name in 1995 and changed to Northlands in 2006. \n\nOn February 18, 2016, Northlands announced that at the end of the 2016 season, the Park would be shut down as part of its Vision 2020 renovation plan, which proposed that the site be redeveloped as outdoor festival grounds. However, Northlands president Tim Reid later announced in August that these plans were subject to discussions with the city, and that \"we have made it clear that our plans are not to continue racing at this site. But we've also got to listen to our stakeholders — the owners, trainers and jockeys — and be considerate of their industry.\" Horse Racing Alberta issued a call for bids to construct a new A-level complex in the city, which was won by Century Casinos. It is expected that Northlands Park will continue to operate until the completion of the new Century Mile facility, which will be located near Edmonton International Airport. The venue was expected to be completed in July 2018 in time to host the Canadian Derby, but has since been delayed to later in the year. The 2017 edition of the race was advertised as being the final Canadian Derby at Northlands, but with the opening of the new track delayed until spring 2019, the 2018 edition will be hosted at Northlands.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26987883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26987883", "title": "Rio Olympic Velodrome", "text": "Rio Olympic Velodrome\n\nThe Rio Olympic Velodrome, officially the Velódromo Municipal do Rio (\"Rio Municipal Velodrome\"), is a velodrome located in the Barra Olympic Park sports complex in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Built as a replacement for the former Barra Velodrome, the venue hosted track cycling events during the 2016 Summer Olympics, and is scheduled to host track cycling events during the 2016 Summer Paralympics. After the conclusion of the games, the velodrome will form part of the Olympic Training Center.\n\nThe Rio Olympic Velodrome was designed by Schuermann Architects, a German design group led by Ralph Schuermann. The group had previously designed the Laoshan Velodrome for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, along with six other Olympic cycling venues and twenty World Championship venues. The wooden track is made from timber sourced from the Siberian pine, considered to be the fastest surface for track cycling.\n\nThe Barra Velodrome, one of three venues built as part of the City of Sports Complex in Barra da Tijuca for the 2007 Pan American Games, was originally planned to host cycling events for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. The original plan for the expansion of the City of Sports Complex into the current-day Barra Olympic Park would have seen the Barra Velodrome receive minor upgrades to prepare it for the Olympics. However, in early 2013, the International Cycling Union (UCI), the governing body of sports cycling, deemed the velodrome as unsuitable for hosting Olympic events, citing pillars obscuring the view of spectators and judges, and cyclists' inability to reach significant speeds on the track. The cost of upgrading the venue to UCI standards was seen as equally as expensive as building a completely new venue, and thus it was decided that the Barra Velodrome was to be demolished in favour of building a new one at a different site in the park. After the Barra Velodrome was demolished, work on the Rio Olympic Velodrome began, with British firm 3D Reid, who designed the Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, was chosen alongside Rio de Janeiro-based firm BLAC Architects to help advise design development of the Velodrome. Tenders to construct and operate the venue were opened in October 2013 and won by Brazilian engineering firm Tecnosolo S.A, at a budget of R$136.9 million. The cost did not include the budget for track installation, which was to be the responsibility of the Olympic Organizing Committee.\n\nConstruction of the velodrome was marred by many issues and controversies, which included numerous delays, poor working conditions and financial difficulties. As with every track cycling venue purpose-built for the Olympics since the 1960 games, the Rio Olympic Velodrome faced cost overruns by its final year of construction. Olympic Games Executive Director Gilbert Felli warned as early as November 2014 that the velodrome had become a concern for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) – the venue was originally planned to be complete by the end of 2015, but delays had organizers worried that it would not open until early 2016 instead, despite the UCI pressing that this would not be the case. Mayor of Rio de Janeiro Eduardo Paes admitted in December 2014 that work on the velodrome was three weeks behind schedule, and evaluations by the IOC in February 2015 found that substantial work still remained in order for the venue to be complete by scheduled test events prior to the Olympics, describing \"very aggressive timelines that will need to be met over the coming months.\" Despite these troubles, Mário Andrada, a spokesperson for the Rio Organizing Committee, stated, \"the delays they cited concern the test events and not to the Games... the velodrome, even though a little late, will not impact the test event. We are counting on it.\"\nIn April 2015, construction was temporarily suspended by Brazil's Ministry of Labor and Employment, claiming a \"grave and imminent danger to the physical safety of workers.\" The ministry cited their concerns for \"the absence of collective protection\", and risk of workers falling, in addition to lack of security, no technical report on the stability of slopes at the site, and what was described as a potentially hazardous \"accumulation of material\". The temporary suspension added even more stress on the construction's timetable, with works being sped up significantly afterwards, with the Organising Committee stressing that \"work was back on track.\" Unfortunately, delays proved to be a valid concern, when cycling test events originally scheduled to take place at the Velodrome on 18 – 20 March 2016 were rescheduled to 29 April – 1 May, due to a delay in the installation of the velodrome's track. Blame was put on poor conditions for the installation of the Siberian-sourced timber, which could potentially lead to the wood warping and bending. It was by then that President of the UCI Brian Cookson made public his concerns about the completion of the venue, bluntly stating to the media, in a press conference after the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, that completing the venue in time for test events in late April was \"a challenge\", and that \"if the velodrome is not ready in time, there is no plan B.\"\nBy late March 2016, however, the track was still not installed, and the planned test event that was delayed to late April was completely cancelled, leaving the venue untested through competition until the Olympics themselves in August. The Organising Committee cited \"logistical problems\" with the import of raw materials from Serbia; the wood arrived late into Rio's summer, and the city's high humidity meant that the sensitive surface could not be laid as quickly as expected. Comments by Mayor Paes that the velodrome was only 85 percent complete, contradicting earlier comments on the venue being near-completion, only fueled more concern, as the Organising Committee set 31 May as the projected date for the venue's completion, and that opportunities for Olympic cyclists to train at the venue will be held on 25 – 27 June. Troubles further escalated when Tecnosolo, the venue's construction and operation contractor, filed for bankruptcy in late May. The municipal government of Rio de Janeiro cancelled the contract with Tecnosolo shortly afterwards, saying in a statement that the company \"did not have the conditions to continue being technically responsible for the construction of the velodrome\". Brazilian real estate firm Engetécnica, who were previously hired as a subcontractor for the venue in February, were hired to replace Tecnosolo and finish construction of the velodrome. By the end of May, the track had finally been installed, with the venue estimated to be 88 percent complete, and training days in the venue for cyclists still penned for late June.\n\nOn 26 June 2016, a month before the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics, the Rio Olympic Organizing Committee finally took possession of the velodrome, marking the end of construction. The very first training events held at the venue took place the previous day. The venue's opening was not without controversy, however, when state prosecutors inquired about the selection of Engetécnica and subcontractor company Zadar for construction and operation contracts, without a proper bidding process. The municipal government of Rio de Janeiro stated that \"the city could not stop the works to comply with time requirements\", affirming that there was no time for a public bidding process under the velodrome's tight construction schedule, and that Zadar and Engetécnica were hired under emergency contracts. Additional works on the velodrome were completed on 10 July, and Olympic cyclists were allowed access on 24 July, two weeks prior to the start of the games.\n\n"}
{"id": "1252848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1252848", "title": "Riverside Stadium", "text": "Riverside Stadium\n\nThe Riverside Stadium is a football stadium in Middlesbrough, England, which has been the home of Middlesbrough F.C. since it opened in 1995. Its current capacity is 34,000 all seated, although there is provisional planning permission in place to expand that to 42,000 if required.\n\nThe stadium was built to replace Ayresome Park after the Taylor Report, which required all top division football stadiums to be all-seater. After the report was delivered in January 1990, Middlesbrough needed an all-seater stadium by August 1994, and were unable to expand Ayresome Park outwards owing to its location in a residential area, and expanding the stadium upwards would have limited the club to a capacity of around 20,000 seats – the club wanted a considerably larger capacity. The decision was taken by club officials to build a new stadium; Teesside Development Corporation offered them the Middlehaven site by the River Tees for development.\n\nThe new 30,000 seater stadium was constructed by Taylor Woodrow Construction for £16 million, taking approximately nine months to complete after work began in the autumn of 1994. The name of the stadium was chosen by the club's fans, following a vote during the final game at Ayresome Park. The other choices available were \"Middlehaven Stadium\", \"Erimus Stadium\" and \"Teesside Stadium\". When first opened, the name was amended to Cellnet Riverside Stadium (and then BT Cellnet Riverside Stadium) as part of a £3 million sponsorship deal with Cellnet, but this deal ended after the 2001–02 season.\n\nThe first game was played against Chelsea in front of a 28,286 crowd (the highest home attendance in 14 years) on 26 August 1995. Middlesbrough won the game 2–0, with Craig Hignett taking the honour of scoring the first ever goal at the stadium, Jan Åge Fjørtoft scoring the second. Their first season at their new stadium was also their first back in the FA Premier League following promotion after two seasons away.\n\nIn their second season at the Riverside Stadium, Middlesbrough were runners-up in both of the domestic cups but a points deduction in the league meant that they were relegated from the Premier League.\n\nIn 1998 – when Middlesbrough were promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt – the capacity was increased by 5,000 by filling in the north and south-west corners at a cost of £5 million. This expansion gave the stadium a 35,100 capacity. Modernisation of the stadium since then has led to the seating being reorganised on several occasions with the stadium currently having a capacity of 34,000 (2017-18 season). The club have the Council's permission to extend the stadium by another 7,000 if demand made it necessary, which would bring its capacity up to approximately 42,000.\nIn 2005 the club resurrected the old Ayresome Park gates which had been famously locked when the club went into liquidation. They were erected outside the Riverside Stadium as a reminder of the past. Another addition has been statues of former players, George Hardwick and Wilf Mannion. In front of the old Ayresome park gates is the location for the \"Borobrick Road\", where fans can pay to have a message inscribed on a brick (often in memory of a deceased family member) to be added to the road. For Armistice Day 2008, a set of bricks commemorating 8 players who died in the World Wars was unveiled.\n\nIn July 2008, planning permission was granted by Middlesbrough Council to construct a wind turbine at the site of the stadium, standing 125 metres high and capable of generating 3 Megawatts of electricity. The turbine will be used to power the stadium, with the excess being sold to the National Grid.\n\nOn 15 March 2013, it was announced that Conference National side Gateshead would stage a \"home\" game at the Riverside Stadium, after continual drainage problems at Gateshead International Stadium caused them to play their last 12 league games of the season at five different venues.\nFollowing the club's promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 2015/16 season, the ground underwent a £5m package of renovations designed to bring it up to the standards required of Premier League stadiums. Renovations included the installation of a large press box at the back of the East Stand, the construction of two permanent TV studios at the back of the South East Corner, with associated access and TV compound on the stadium's exterior, an internal reorganisation of the West Stand reception, tunnel and changing room area, new floodlights and refurbished concourse areas including the addition of new kiosks and card and contactless payment methods.\n\nLike its predecessor Ayresome Park, the Riverside Stadium has played host to international football. During the construction of the new Wembley Stadium, the England national football team toured the country, playing at varying grounds. The Riverside was chosen to host the Euro 2004 qualifying match against Slovakia on 11 June 2003. England won the match 2–1 with a brace from Michael Owen after Vladimír Janočko had put Slovakia ahead. The match is also notable for pitting Middlesbrough's England defender Gareth Southgate against their own Slovakian striker at the time, Szilárd Németh.\n\nOn 24 April 2012 it was announced that The Riverside Stadium would host the only public warm up match for Team GB before the London 2012 Olympic Games against Brazil Olympic Football Team. Football stars including Ryan Giggs, Craig Bellamy, Thiago Silva, Neymar, Lucas Moura, Hulk and even Middlesbrough's Jason Steele all featured in the match in which Brazil Olympic Football Team outclassed Team GB winning 2–0 with 12 shots on target for Brazil compared to the 1 shot on target achieved by Team GB.\n\nThe stadium is fully enclosed with every seat offering an uninterrupted view of the pitch. The four main stands are commonly known as the North, East, West and South stands. The corners are referred to as the North-East, North-West, South-East and South-West corners. Concourses run around the entirety of the ground with kiosks serving food and drink.\n\nThe North stand backs on to the River Tees and at the back of the Stand is some of the vocal support is housed, and thus is also known as the New Holgate End in reference the Holgate End at Ayresome Park, where the similar vocal supporters were located.\n\nThe West stand runs along the length of the pitch and is the stadium's largest stand. The stand contains a number of executive boxes along its length as well as restaurants etc. The stand houses the changing rooms, and the players tunnel emerges from the middle of the stand. White seating in the top tier spells out the club's nickname \"BORO\".\n\nThe East stand greets the players as they walk out the tunnel. The main television gantry was reallocated to the top of the stand from the west stand in 2016. White seating in the top tier of the stand spells out \"MFC\". The roof houses five flagpoles with various flags flying, usually representing the league and cup competitions the club are participating in, as well as a flag of the team crest. A new press box was installed at the back of this stand in preparation for the club's re-entry into the Premier League. The East stand houses a Family Zone (North east end) and also visiting supporters (South East Corner). Prior the 2016/17 season, two permanent television studios were installed at the back of the South East Corner, either side of the existing giant TV screen. One effect of this was a reduction in overall capacity.\n\nThe South stand has previously housed visiting supporters (now relocated to the East stand), but since the 2013/14 season is currently (2017/18 season) occupied by home supporters. It includes most of the vocal support is held, including Boro's own \"Ultras\" Group, the \"Red Faction\".\n\n\n"}

It is also used by the association football club Football Agglomération Carcassonne for their big matches. Built in 1899, it is one of the oldest stadiums in France, and was renovated in 2002, and again in 2012 when US Carcassonne entered the Pro D2.

The stadium is also equipped for athletics and has an eight lane 400m track. \n\nThe stadium has been used in Rugby League World Cups. The ground has hosted many French rugby league championship and cup finals as well as French rugby league internationals, the first being in 1967 when Great Britain national rugby league team won 16-13 in front of 10,650 spectators\n\nFormerly called 'le stade de la Pepiniere' the ground was built and opened in 1899 and sits within the medieval castle walls of the city.

The council built the two main stands that run along the length of the pitch each able to hold 3,000 spectators, floodlights and a cycle track were also installed. The stadium has been renovated twice since in 2002 and in 2012. The ground is named after the former US Carcassonne and French rugby union international player Albert Domec who played as a centre during the 1920s and 1930s.

It was the home field of the Canadian Football League's Saskatchewan Roughriders from its initial establishment as complete stadium in 1936 until 2016, although the team was playing some of its games at the site as early as 1921. Originally designed to house baseball as well as football, the stadium was converted to a football-only facility in 1966.\n\nTaylor Field was also the home field for the University of Regina Rams, who play in U Sports' Canada West conference, the Regina Thunder, who play in the Canadian Junior Football League; and the Regina Riot of the Western Women's Canadian Football League. The field was also used to play high school football. It was owned and managed by the city of Regina. The field featured artificial turf and, as of 2012, a seating capacity of 32,848.\n\nThe stadium closed after the 2016 season, being succeeded by the new Mosaic Stadium at Evraz Place, which was completed in 2016 and became the Roughriders' home field beginning in the 2017 CFL season. Demolition of the stadium commenced in September 2017 and was completed on October 27, 2017. The site will be converted into a mixed use development.\n\nThe stadium was located in the North Central portion of Regina. Beginning in 1910, the original Regina Rugby Club played at various venues throughout the city, including Dominion Park and Exhibition Park. In 1921, the team began playing at a soccer field known as Park Hughes.\n\nIn 1928, Park Hughes and an adjoining baseball diamond known as Park de Young were reconfigured to provide a better venue to accommodate the growing number of baseball and football fans. To make the facility suitable for both sports, the football field was laid out in a unique diagonal pattern, a configuration which would persist throughout the remainder of the facility's existence.\n\nNevertheless, the venue's facilities remained rudimentary even by contemporary standards. The playing surface was little more than plain dirt. When heavy rain turned the field to mud, the team was compelled to relocate games to other venues in the city, including the RCMP barracks. At the time, the barracks housed a unit informally called the \"Roughriders\" who were tasked with breaking in wild broncos for the force. In 1924, the Regina Rugby Club would adopt the \"Roughriders\" nickname as their own.\n\nAfter the first permanent grandstand was built in 1936, the team moved into the facility full-time and remain there for the next eight decades. However, for a decade after the first permanent seating was built, the playing surface remained dirt, with a new layer of topsoil added every year. Late-season games were frequently played in dust bowl conditions. Finally, in 1946, the city recreation board agreed to plant a more stable grass surface.\n\nIn 1947 the facility was renamed Taylor Field after recently deceased Neil J. \"Piffles\" Taylor, a First World War fighter pilot and postwar lawyer who played and coached rugby union and football in the city, and subsequently served as president of the Regina Roughriders, the Canadian Rugby Union and the Western Interprovincial Football Union. A man of legendary toughness, Taylor lost an eye in action during the First World War, and spent more than a year in a German prisoner of war camp, but persisted in playing football in the 1920s. His artificial glass eye was once jolted out of its socket when he was tackled. All play stopped while players from both teams hunted for the missing eye. When found, Taylor cleaned it, then popped it back into its socket and resumed play.\n\nFormer Rider receiver Hugh Campbell said in the documentary \"CFL Traditions\" in 2003. \"When I first saw the stadium in Regina (in 1963), it looked like a farmer had built it, you know, like they'd just added on a few pieces here and there and half of the dressing room was dirt floor, where us rookies got to be. But we had a hook for everybody to hang their clothes on so that was a pretty good deal.\"\n\nRenovations in 1978-79 increased the seating capacity by about 7,000 seats with the addition of an upper-level grandstand on the west side of the stadium, in addition, the stadium gained an artificial turf surface which replaced the natural grass surface previously used. In 2005, a new scoreboard was installed, which included the stadium's first permanent giant replay screen.\n\nIn 2005, Mosaic Stadium gained refurbished washrooms, concessions and refurbished seats on the east side, a new sound system, and the new \"SaskTel MaxTron\" video board. In 2006, a VIP deck and stands were put in place in the south endzone, allowing the football club to host its corporate game day sponsors. In 2007, the field was switched to the next-generation FieldTurfMosaic was the last stadium in the CFL to still use the old-style AstroTurf.\n\nOn June 23, 2006, the Roughriders and The Mosaic Company announced a 10-year, $3.75 million naming rights deal. Unlike other similar deals, which have seen original names of facilities disappear, it was decided to retain the Taylor Field name, thus the facility was renamed Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field.\n\nOn July 31, 2008, the Roughriders announced that temporary seats would be added to the stadium due to high demand for ticketsthe team had sold out every home game for the 2008 season. With tickets in high demand coming off their Grey Cup season, an extra 2,145 seats were added, bringing the capacity to 30,945. The seating was first put to use during the Labour Day Classic against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Following the 2008 West Semi-Final game on November 8, 2008 against the BC Lions, the temporary seats were taken down, putting the capacity back to the original number of 28,800. 2,145 temporary extra seats were put in place for 2009 season. Temporary seating was again put in place for the 2010 season; however, the additional seating only raised capacity to 30,048.\n\nOn February 24, 2012, the Roughriders announced a $14 million renovation plan known as the \"Legacy Project\" to prepare the stadium for hosting the 101st Grey Cup. Riders chairman Roger Brandvold was quoted as saying \"Replacing Mosaic Stadium still remains our top priority, but certain upgrades needed to be made to get us through the next few years and especially the 2013 Grey Cup\". The first stage of the renovations were finished in time for the start of the 2012 season, with the addition of 7,000 extra seats and 27 new corporate suites (arranged to give the stadium a more \"bowl\"-like feel), additional bathrooms and concessions, the \"SaskTel MaxTron\" video screen and scoreboard upgraded to a 60-foot LED screen (with a second display directly alongside, shaped like the province of Saskatchewan), a new 55-foot video screen attached to the west grandstand, and ribbon screens along the bottom of the grandstands. For the 2013 season, its capacity was expanded to 45,000 with temporary seating, which were removed for the following season.\n\n\nIt was announced on May 4, 2009 that Aerosmith would be performing at Mosaic Stadium on August 9 as part of the Aerosmith/ZZ Top Tour. This concert, however, was cancelled due to the injuries that Steven Tyler sustained after falling off the stage in Sturgis, South Dakota.\n\nOn July 12, 2012 during a pre-game ceremony, Premier of Saskatchewan Brad Wall and Regina mayor Pat Fiacco announced that a new stadium would be constructed for the Roughriders at Regina's exhibition grounds. With an estimated budget of $278 million, the new Mosaic Stadium will seat 33,000, and be completed by in time for the 2017 CFL season in June 2017.\n\nTaylor Field hosted its final Roughriders game on October 29, 2016. The following week, it hosted its final football game, a Canada West conference semi-final with the Regina Rams.\n\nIn 2017, items from the former stadium were auctioned off in advance of its decommissioning and eventual demolition. Demolition began in September 2017; the tallest portion, and the last standing section of the structure, the west grandstand, was toppled on October 27, 2017.\n\n\n"}

Numbers are used for the purpose of easily identifying each person on the field as no two people from the same team can wear the same number. Although designed for identification purposes only, numbers have become the source of superstition, emotional attachment, and honor (in the form of a number retirement). The number is always on the back of the jersey, often on the front, and occasionally seen on the left leg of the pants.\n\nRumor has it that the uniform number first appeared in the 19th century, but the earliest official record is from 1907, when the Reading Red Roses of the Atlantic League numbered its players' jerseys in an effort to help the fans identify them. While it is unknown if the team ever took the field with numbers, it did mark the beginning of the idea of uniform numbers. The uniform number appeared on the jerseys of the Cuban Stars, a traveling team of the early 1900s, in 1909. In an issue of the \"Chicago Daily News\", star pitcher José Méndez is seen wearing the number 12 on his left sleeve.\n\nThe first time a Major League team wore numbers was on June 26, 1916. Inspired by football's and hockey's use of numbers, the Cleveland Indians trotted on their home field wearing large numbers on their left sleeves. This \"experiment\" was tried for a few weeks, again the next season, and then abandoned. In 1923, the St. Louis Cardinals adopted uniform numbers on their sleeves. However, as then-manager Branch Rickey recalled, the Cardinals' players were \"subjected to field criticism from the stands and especially from opposing players,\" so the numbers were removed. At this time, the Indianapolis ABC's of the Negro National League and the San Antonio Bears of the Texas League also tried out numbers.\nIn 1929, the New York Yankees were planning to start the season with uniform numbers on the back of the jersey. The Indians also planned to wear numbers in this fashion. The Yankees were rained out on opening day, April 16, while the Indians played, making Cleveland the first MLB franchise to wear numbers on the back. The Yankees debuted their numbered jerseys two days after, April 18. By the mid-1930s, all MLB teams wore numbers; in 1937 the Philadelphia Athletics finally began wearing numbers on both home and away jerseys, making numbers a universal trait in the MLB. The first MLB game to feature both teams wearing numbers on their jerseys was the game between the Indians and the Yankees on May 13, 1929.\n\nIn 1951, the Springfield Cubs of the International League pioneered the look of having numbers on the front of the jersey. A year later, the Brooklyn Dodgers incorporated the idea into MLB. They had intended numbers-on-front to be first used in their 1951 World Series appearance, an event which did not occur because of Bobby Thomson's walk-off home run in the last game of the tiebreaker series between the Dodgers and the Giants. Today, numbers on the front are very common at all levels of play. In 1940, the Memphis Red Sox of the Negro American League wore numbers on their pants leg; the idea didn't catch on in MLB until the 1975-78 Astros wore numbers on their front left hip.\n\nToday, the Philadelphia Phillies are the only Major League team to wear a number on the sleeve of their jerseys.\n\nThe official rules of baseball state that uniforms must be identical for all members of a team. The only mention of uniform number is that it must be on the back and a minimum of six inches tall. Each player must have their own unique number, but there is no rule requiring coaches to have unique numbers. For example, in 2015, Alan Trammell (who wore number 3 for his lengthy career as a Detroit Tigers player and manager) returned to coach first base and wore 3 again, despite the number belonging to Ian Kinsler at the time, marking a rare instance of a coach sharing a number with a player.\n\nIn their first career games, Cincinnati Reds outfielder Eric Davis and Chicago White Sox pitcher Joe Horlen did not have jersey numbers. Both of these players were just called up to the big league team while it was on the road and the only uniform available had no number.\n\nOn September 27, 1999, Detroit Tigers center fielder Gabe Kapler took the field donning a numberless uniform. That day, the Tigers played their last game at historic Tiger Stadium and, in honor of great Tigers of the past, members of the starting lineup wore the uniform numbers of corresponding members of an All-Time Detroit Tigers team voted on by the fans. Since Kapler played center field, he was to wear Ty Cobb's uniform number, but since Cobb played before numbers were used, Kapler's back was blank.\n\nFor the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park on April 20, 2012, the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees wore 1912-style uniforms which had no numbers.\n\nOn Jackie Robinson Day, teams across the MLB all wear uniform number 42 to honor him. [See \"Retired numbers,\" below.] The MLB has taken this tribute so far that, on that day only, all 30 team websites' active rosters say that every player on the team is number 42.\n\nThe original baseball numbers were based on the lineup. The starting players would be numbered 1-8, based on their spot in the order. The backup catcher would be number 9, and the pitchers would wear 10-14 (but not 13, as that is superstitious). Notable examples of this system are teammates Babe Ruth (he was number 3 and batted third for the Yankees) and Lou Gehrig (number 4, batted fourth).\n\nSeveral teams experimented with numbering-by-position during the 1930s. In , the Cincinnati Reds, under general manager Warren Giles, introduced what would be the longest-lasting convention, in which pitchers wore numbers between 30 and 49; outfielders between 20 and 29; infielders between 10 and 19; and catchers, coaches and managers in the single digits. (An exception occurred in the early 1950s, when the Reds' coaches and managers were assigned numbers in the fifties.)\n\nThe New York Giants adopted this system in 1947, and when Giles became chief executive of the National League in 1952, many other NL clubs began to follow suit. Two American League teams, the first edition of the expansion Los Angeles Angels and the Cleveland Indians beginning in 1963, also adopted the numbering scheme.\n\nIn his memoir, \"Ball Four\", pitcher Jim Bouton tells how he asked his new NL team, the Houston Astros, for his traditional number 56, but was assigned 44 instead because of the numbering custom. Bouton wrote: \"I asked if there was any chance I could get 56. [The equipment manager] said he didn't think so, that all our pitchers have numbers in the 30s and 40s. He said I'd have to talk to [general manager Spec] Richardson or manager Harry Walker if I wanted to change the rule. I said I was sure they wouldn't want to be bothered with something so small, and he said, 'Oh, you'd be surprised.' Oh no I wouldn't.\"\n\nHowever, the number-by-position convention was never a formal rule, and a few National League clubs — notably the Los Angeles Dodgers — resisted the idea. The custom was slowly abandoned during the 1970s and 1980s. (In fact, in 1970, the Astros assigned Bouton his traditional number 56.)\n\nToday teams do not assign numbers based on any system; personal preference combined with retired numbers has made it impossible. However, a few trends do present themselves quite clearly: Infielders, especially shortstops and second basemen, tend to be the players who would wear single digit numbers. Single digit numbers, however, are not rare for outfielders or catchers.\n\nOften players grow emotionally attached to a number. When a player switches teams, his number is often already in use. Since the MLB allows number changes at any time, bribes may occur for numbers. Among the most outrageous are when Brian Jordan joined the Atlanta Braves and gave then-third base coach Fredi González a $40,000 motorcycle for #33, and when Rickey Henderson joined the Toronto Blue Jays and paid Turner Ward $25,000 for Henderson's long-time career #24. Not every player pays top dollar for his number; when Mitch Williams joined the Philadelphia Phillies, he bought #28 from John Kruk for $10 and two cases of beer. The following season, Williams would change his number to #99 after Rick \"Wild Thing\" Vaughn, the character in the 1989 film, \"Major League\", whose erratic pitching style resembled his own.\n\nIn 1951, independent ball player Johnny Neves wore the number 7 backwards because \"Neves\" spelled backwards is \"seven\". Bill Voiselle, who is from Ninety Six, South Carolina, wore #96 from 1947–1950 to honor his hometown. Carlos May, who was born on May 17, wore number 17, meaning that his jersey read both his name and number and his birthday (\"May 17\").\n\nSome players who are unable to acquire the number they had on their previous team will obtain a similar number. For example, Roger Clemens wore #21 during the first 15 years of his career with the Red Sox and Blue Jays and during his college days at the University of Texas. When he joined the Yankees and the Houston Astros, he switched to #22. Upon Clemens' arrival in New York, he reportedly asked long-time Yankee outfielder Paul O'Neill to surrender his #21, but O'Neill refused. Though he would eventually opt for #22, Clemens initially reversed his beloved #21, and wore #12. Clemens continued to wear #22 upon signing with his hometown Astros in 2004 and, upon re-signing with the Yankees, Robinson Canó, owner of #22 at the beginning of the 2007 season, moved to #24 in anticipation of the Yankees possibly re-signing Clemens, leaving #22 available for Clemens.\n\nJoe Beimel has worn #97 throughout his career because his first child was born in 1997. David Wells wore #3 while with the Red Sox because his favorite player, Babe Ruth, wore #3. When he played with the Yankees, Wells could not have #3 (retired for Babe Ruth), so he wore #33. In his final season, playing for the Red Sox, J. T. Snow wore #84 to honor his father Jack, a former NFL wide receiver.\n\nEddie Gaedel, the dwarf who made one plate appearance for the St. Louis Browns, wore the number ⅛. The uniform belonged to the young son of Browns executive Bill DeWitt. The boy, William DeWitt, Jr., was then the team's batboy; he is now the principal owner of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nBaseball Hall of Fame manager Joe McCarthy never wore a digit on the back of his uniform with the Yankees (1931–1946) and Red Sox (1948–1950), despite managing during the era when numbers became widespread in Major League Baseball.\n\nJoe Girardi, in his managerial role with the Yankees, wore #27 to signify his desire to lead the team to their 27th championship. After winning the 2009 World Series, he subsequently switched to #28.\n\nThe most legendary players, managers, or coaches on a team will sometimes have their uniform number retired, so that future players and coaches cannot wear those numbers with that team. Only the player with the retired number can wear that number if he returns to that team as a player or coach. Generally, such retirements are reserved for the very best, who in most cases, have impacted the entire league, and are most memorable.\n\nThe first Major League Baseball player to have his number retired was Lou Gehrig (#4). #4 and #5 have each been retired by 8 teams, more than any other number. The highest player uniform number to be retired was Carlton Fisk's #72, but the Cardinals retired #85 in honor of their one-time owner August Busch, Jr.. Though he never wore a uniform, that is how old he was at the time of the honor. The Cleveland Indians retired the #455 in 2001 in honor of \"the fans\", to commemorate the then-longest home sellout streak ever (although MLB does not allow any team to issue three-digit uniform numbers).\n\nEight players and one manager, Casey Stengel, have had their numbers retired with more than one team. Nolan Ryan had two different numbers (#30 and #34) retired among three different teams. Fisk's #27 from the Red Sox and #72 from the White Sox are both retired, as are Reggie Jackson's #9 and #44, respectively, by the A's and Yankees.\nThe New York Yankees have retired more numbers than any other team (19 numbers for 20 players), including all non-zero single digit numbers, meaning that many Yankees players get higher numbers because there aren't enough low numbers left.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays traditionally had not retired numbers, but have an alternative method of honoring their players called the 'Level of Excellence'. They did retire Roberto Alomar's number #12 in 2011, due to him being inducted into the Hall of Fame. They later retired number #32 in honor of Roy Halladay, after his death. They also added him to the Level of Excellence.\n\nOn August 6, 2016 the Seattle Mariners retired #24 throughout the organization in honor of Ken Griffey Jr.'s induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He is the first Mariners player to have his number retired. \n\nIn 1997, Major League Baseball, for the first time ever, made a Major League-wide retirement of a number. Number 42 cannot be issued to any new players, having been retired in honor of Jackie Robinson, although all players who currently wore the number upon the mass retirement of #42, such as Mo Vaughn and Butch Huskey of the Red Sox and Mets, were allowed to keep it under a grandfather clause if they were wearing the number in honor of Jackie Robinson. The clause also permitted such players who changed teams after the retirement date to retain #42 with their new team if it was available; thus, Vaughn (Red Sox, Angels, and Mets), Mike Jackson (Indians and Twins), and José Lima (Astros and Tigers) became the last players to wear the number #42 with two or more teams. With the retirement of Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees following the 2013 season, no MLB player currently wears #42 regularly. Art Silber, owner and coach of the Nationals' Class-A Affiliate Potomac, wears the number 42 as well. The Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom Robinson played (as a Brooklyn Dodger), had already retired the number in 1972 before Robinson's death.\n\nHowever, the #42 would be worn by a number of players other than Rivera in 2007, which marked the 60th anniversary of Robinson's first appearance in Major League Baseball (the event that broke the sport's 20th-century color line). Before the season, then-Cincinnati Reds outfielder Ken Griffey, Jr. asked Robinson's widow, Rachel Robinson, and MLB Commissioner Bud Selig for permission to wear #42 on April 15, the anniversary date of Robinson's historic game. Both gave their approval, and Selig later ruled that any player who wished to wear #42 on that date could do so. Three teams and several individual players on other teams wore #42 on that date; three other teams whose plans to wear #42 collectively were postponed due to rain on that date did so later in the month. Since 2009, all players and coaches on all teams have worn #42 on April 15 in honor of Robinson.\n\nSome feel that Roberto Clemente deserves a similar honor, and that #21 should be retired by all teams. Clemente opened the doors for Hispanics to play Major League Baseball, just as Robinson did for African-Americans. He died in a plane crash in 1972 while helping earthquake victims from Nicaragua, ending his storied career too soon. Number 21 is retired by Clemente's team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, and was worn by Sammy Sosa throughout his career as a tribute to his childhood hero.\n"}

{"id": "676326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=676326", "title": "WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca", "text": "WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca\n\nWeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca (previously known as Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca and Laguna Seca Raceway) is a paved road racing track in central California used for both auto racing and motorcycle racing, built in 1957 near both Salinas and Monterey, California, United States.\n\nThe racetrack is long, with a elevation change. Its eleven turns are highlighted by the circuit's signature turn, the downhill-plunging \"Corkscrew\" at Turns 8 and 8A. A variety of racing, exhibition, and entertainment events are held at the raceway, ranging from superkarts to sports car racing to music festivals.\n\nThe name Laguna Seca is Spanish for \"dry lagoon\": the area where the track now lies was once a lake, and the course was built around the dry lake bed. After the course was reconfigured, two artificial ponds were added.\n\nThe earliest development of the local area occurred in 1867 with the founding of the nearby Laguna Seca Ranch, which has operated continuously for 140 years with grazing and equestrian uses.\n\nThe track was built in 1957 at a cost of $1.5 million raised from local businesses and individuals on part of the US Army's Fort Ord (a maneuver area and field artillery target range) after the nearby Pebble Beach Road Races were abandoned for being too dangerous. Since 1974, the property was deeded over to the Monterey County Parks Department and continues to be part of the park system.\n\nThe first race, held on November 9, 1957, was won by Pete Lovely driving a Ferrari. In the intervening years, the track has hosted USRRC, Can-Am, Trans-Am, Formula 5000, IMSA GT, CART, American Le Mans Series, Grand American, Monterey Historic Automobile Races, Speed World Challenge, AMA (American Motorcyclist Association), WSBK Superbike World Championship and MotoGP motorcycle races (but 125/Moto3 and 250/Moto2 are not admitted).\n\nThe day-to-day operations of the track, along with the management and promotion of major racing events, are handled by the Sports Car Racing Association of the Monterey Peninsula (SCRAMP), which is a non-profit organization. With oversight by a board of local residents, SCRAMP operates with a professional staff on-site with the goal of generating income through the operations of the racetrack which is then redistributed to local charities.\n\nThe track itself has undergone significant changes over the past two decades to meet evolving safety homologation requirements of the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and other sanctioning bodies. Changes include the addition of the entire infield area in 1988 (present day turns 3, 4, and 5, eliminating the straight that started at present day turn 2 and ended at present day turn 5) extending the track from its original length to meet the minimum-track-length criteria of the FIM for MotoGP events, plus the more recent relocation of pedestrian bridges and embankments, and the expansion of gravel pits outside turns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 for additional runoff. The original media center was demolished in 2006 to make way for additional run-off room in Turn 1. Also in 2006, the 'hump' at the top of the Rahal Straight was flattened to accommodate the MotoGP riders, though some claim that this increases the wind effects that can perturb a race motorcycle. Remnants of the old configuration can still be seen from the parking lot between turns two and five. They are found underneath a road leading to the parking area for entrant trailers and RVs.\n\nThe famous Turn 8 and 8A combination, popularly referred to as 'the Corkscrew', is considered one of the motorsport world's most challenging turns, due to the 18-metre drop in elevation as well as its blind crest and apex on the uphill approach.\nTurn 2, with its difficult and technical double-apex, has been renamed the 'Andretti Hairpin', in honor of former Formula 1 World Champion Mario Andretti, while Turn 9 has been renamed 'Rainey Curve' in honor of 500cc Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champion Wayne Rainey, a resident of nearby Salinas, California. Also the straight that runs between Turn 6 and Turn 7 has been renamed the 'Rahal Straight' after four-time consecutive Champ Car race winner Bobby Rahal.\n\nA Champ Car World Series weekend had been a prominent event from 1983 through 2004, when its spot on the calendar was shifted to the San Jose Grand Prix. On the last lap of the 1996 CART race, Alex Zanardi passed Bryan Herta on the inside of the Corkscrew to take the victory. Uruguayan driver Gonzalo Rodríguez died during the practice session of the 1999 CART race after crashing at the same corner. Because of the incident, runoff was installed at the end of the Rahal Straight.\n\nChamp Car announced on September 11, 2007 that they would be returning the Northern California race to Laguna Seca from San Jose over the May 16–18 weekend in 2008. But the subsequent merger of Champ Car and IndyCar resulted in the race being canceled.\n\nThe track is also the site of the annual Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion, formerly known as the Monterey Historic Automobile Races. The event features an extraordinarily eclectic mixture of race cars on the course. Each year features a different marque. Considered one of the two greatest historic racing events (along with the Goodwood Festival in England), attendance often rivals, or surpasses the professional racing events listed above.\n\nThere are many permanent dry and hook-up camping facilities located at the raceway, which are available year-round as part of the Laguna Seca Recreation Area, the county park in which the racetrack is set.\n\nThe track's primary corporate sponsor is WeatherTech which began April 2018. As part of the sponsorship, the track is now officially referred to as WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca. Previously, the sponsorship belonged to Mazda for 17 years with the track being known as Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.\n\nA study by California State University, Monterey Bay and commissioned by SCRAMP states that the raceway generates $62.1 million to the Monterey County economy and $5.2 million in state and local taxes.\n\nMajor events each year include the US round of the World Superbike Championship (held in conjunction with a round of the MotoAmerica championship), Monterey Sports Car Championships (WeatherTech SportsCar Championship), and the Monterey Historics for classic racecars.\n\nIn 1989, the year following the last Formula One race in Detroit, choices for a new location for the United States Grand Prix came down to Laguna Seca and Phoenix. The aforementioned 1988 improvements to the track were made in part to lure the F1 race. In the final decision, Laguna Seca was thought to be too remote and too small for an F1 crowd, and so Phoenix was granted the Grand Prix.\n\nOn August 20, 2006, Toyota F1 test driver Ricardo Zonta set an unofficial lap record of 1:06.309. The previous record time was 1:07.722, set by Hélio Castroneves in a Penske Champ Car during qualifying for the 2000 CART Honda Grand Prix of Monterey. The unofficial record was re-taken by a Champ Car on March 10, 2007 by Sébastien Bourdais, who lapped in 1'05.880 during Champ Car Spring Training. The unofficial record was again re-taken by a Formula One car on May 19, 2012 by Marc Gené, who lapped in 1'05.786 in a Ferrari F2003-GA during the 2012 Ferrari Racing Days.\n\nOfficially, Castroneves is still the recordholder as the times of Zonta, Bourdais and Gené were set during exhibition and testing sessions, and official records can only be set in race conditions (either in practice, qualifying, or during a race).\n\nAt the 2008 Monterey Sports Car Championships, David Brabham set a pole position time of 1:10.103 in a Le Mans Prototype.\n\nThe fastest lap at the 2006 A1GP race was 1:17.951, set by Nicolas Lapierre.\n\nAt the 2012 United States motorcycle Grand Prix, Jorge Lorenzo set a pole time of 1:20.554 on the Yamaha. During the 2014 Superbike World Championship season, Tom Sykes set a time of 1:21.811 on the Kawasaki.\n\nThe Porsche 918 Spyder held the previous production car lap record with 1:29.89.\n\nThe 2016 Dodge Viper ACR holds the current production car lap record with 1:28.65.\n\nThe 2019 Jaguar XE Project 8 holds the current four-door production sedan lap record with 1:37.54 set by driver Randy Pobst. \n\nDuring qualifying for the 2011 FIM e-Power International Championship/TTXGP World Series race, Steve Rapp rode the Mission Motors Mission R to the electric vehicle record with 1:31.376. \n\nOn 17th September 2018 Tesla Roadstar development driver Emile Bouret shared in Twitter & Instagram that he with the assistance of Development Engineering Team of Tesla, Inc. in a stock Tesla Model S P100D completed the lap in 1:43:06 officially breaking the overall Fastest Production EV lap record & also an unofficial recent lap time of 1:46.8 by amateur driver Cameron Rogers in a Tesla Model 3 on September 14 2018. Currently Emile Bouret officially holds the Fastest Production EV lap record is this circuit. Cameron Rogers narrowly beat out the previous lap record of 1:48.18 set by professional driver Randy Pobst in a Jaguar I-PACE.\n\nWhen not being used by the major events the track can be rented. Approximately twice a year the Sports Car Club of America holds regional club races for the San Francisco Region. Various clubs rent the track throughout the year for informal high performance driving schools that allow the public to drive their own cars at speed. The raceway has also played host to prototype testing of the Nissan GT-R in 2007.\n\nThe track is featured in video games such as the Gran Turismo series (including the bike version Tourist Trophy), Forza Motorsport, and the MotoGP series. In a bid to compare real life versus video games, Jeremy Clarkson of the British automotive show \"Top Gear\" attempted to beat his Gran Turismo time of 1:41.148 in a Honda NSX by racing the real track in the same car in 2005. During the trials, Clarkson determined that the game omitted a few details of the track, and the game's physics allowed him to brake later when coming into turns than he could in real life. As a consequence, reality prevailed and he managed a best time of only 1:57 on the real course. However, both he and the track instructor agreed that it is possible to complete the course in 1:41 in a Honda NSX if the driver were sufficiently experienced, talented, and most importantly fearless.\n\nIt was also used in 1975 for the film \"Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo\" as a qualifying track.\n\nLaguna Seca and the part of the old Fort Ord that is now Bureau of Land Management land annually host the Sea Otter Classic \"Celebration of Cycling\". The event has now become the largest cycling festival in the United States, bringing in over 10,000 racers and over 100,000 spectators - and is now the first major event of the year, typically held in April – for both the road bike and mountain bike professional seasons.\n\nSeveral times each year, bicycles are permitted on the track for 2 hours. The admission fee is $10 per bicycle rider.\n\nLaguna Seca served as the finish line for Stage 4 of the 2016 Amgen Tour of California and\nStage 3 of the 2018 Amgen Tour of California bicycle races.\n\nThe raceway has been occasionally as a venue for concerts and other non-sporting events. The Grateful Dead performed on the racetrack in May 1987; Later that night, the band filmed their music video for \"Touch of Grey\" there.\n\nOn September 17, 1987, Pope John Paul II celebrated mass at Laguna Seca Raceway, where 72,000 people had gathered to see him. \n\nIn the 1990s, the raceway was the venue for the Laguna Seca Daze music festival, which featured performances from music acts in the folk, alternative rock and jam band genres. Artists who performed at the festival include Bob Dylan, Phish, Blues Traveler, 10,000 Maniacs, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Meat Puppets, 4 Non Blondes, Jeff Healey, The Allman Brothers Band, Gin Blossoms and Shawn Colvin.\n\nOn June 24, 2011, John Mueller of Muellerized Suspension Systems married Sheila Stone on the top of the Corkscrew at Laguna Seca. This is the location where the ashes of Lee Mueller (4 time SCCA National Champion, IMSA GTU Champion, 3 time winner of the 24 Hours of Daytona, and 12 Hours of Sebring winner), John Mueller's father, were spread.\n\n\n\"Laguna Seca Raceway: 40 Years Through the Corkscrew: 1957-1997\" (David and Mary-Ellen Wright-Rana, 1997) — \n\n"}

{"id": "1050041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1050041", "title": "Withdean Stadium", "text": "Withdean Stadium\n\nWithdean Stadium is an athletics stadium in Withdean, a suburb of Brighton. Between 1999 and 2011 it was the home ground of football team Brighton & Hove Albion F.C..\n\nThe capacity of the ground was 8,850 people, all seated. The stadium was temporary home for Brighton whilst a new stadium was built in nearby Falmer. The club's former stadium, the Goldstone Ground, was sold for redevelopment in 1997 by the board of the time, none of whom any longer has any involvement with the club. This resulted in the team playing their home matches for two seasons at Gillingham's Priestfield Stadium, over from Brighton, before moving to Withdean Stadium. The only other local option for Albion had been to play at Sussex CCC's County Cricket Ground, Hove.\nWithdean Stadium was voted the fourth worst stadium in the UK by \"The Observer\" in 2004. The temporary nature of the stadium is obvious - the stadium is primarily used for athletics; there is a single permanent stand along the north side, while the other stands are assembled from scaffolding, some of which has also served as temporary seating at the Open Championship golf tournament. The largest is the South Stand, running the entire length of the pitch. The east end of the pitch contains two medium-sized and one small stand. One of the larger stands here is designated as the family stand. The West Stand was the designated away stand. Changing and hospitality facilities are provided with portable cabins placed haphazardly around the site, and there is very limited on-site car parking.\n\nThere was considerable opposition in the neighbourhood to allowing the club to use the stadium. After some unique concessions were made, the club was allowed to move into Withdean in 1999. Amplified music was banned during football matches (except for the traditional \"Sussex by the Sea\"), and matchday parking restrictions were imposed within a one-mile radius of the ground. After a year, the music restrictions were eased, but the parking limitations continued in force. The price of each match ticket included a public transportation voucher allowing free bus or rail travel throughout the Brighton and Hove area.\n\nFor Albion's match against Sheffield United on 2 October 2004 the stadium was temporarily renamed Palookaville as it hosted the launch party for Fatboy Slim's album of the same name. The album was released on Skint Records, then the club's shirt sponsor, and for that match the team wore shirts bearing the name Palookaville instead of Skint. The name Palookaville was also considered appropriate by fans because it reflected the inadequacy of the club's temporary home.\n\nAdditional seating was added at the East and West Ends of the ground in November 2005. The club played their last game at Withdean on Saturday 30 April 2011 against Huddersfield Town.\n\nSome of the temporary seating used at Withdean, is now being used by Whitehawk FC at East Brighton Park.\n\nThe stadium was managed and maintained under contract from Brighton and Hove city council by D C Leisure Management. The staff responsible for the preparation and maintenance of the stadium on match days used to be employed and managed by D C Leisure (when the company was called Ecovert Management Limited) until the 2003–2004 football season when responsibility of match day stadium staff was handed over to Brighton and Hove Albion F.C..\n\nThe staff responsible for the leisure facilities of the stadium complex including the gym, squash and tennis courts, spa and the stadium on non-match days are still employed and managed by D C Leisure.\n\n"}
