These sports take place on a variety of terrain, from paved flat-ground and snow-covered hills to water and air. Most boardsports are considered action sports or extreme sports, and thus often appeal to youth. A large proportion of youth partaking in these sports, together with aesthetic damage to property from sports like skateboarding, has led to many board sports being marginalized by the greater world of sports in the past. However, many board sports are ever-more frequently gaining mainstream recognition, and with this recognition have enjoyed wider broadcast, sponsorship and inclusion in institutional sporting events, including the Olympic Games.\n\nSurfing was the first boardsport, originating from Polynesian culture. Skateboarding was then invented by surfers looking to \"surf\" on land. It is hard to estimate when most boardsports were \"invented\" because people have been making homemade versions throughout history. For example, it is not hard to conceive of a person, who is familiar with the concept of skiing or sledding, standing sideways on a plank of wood and riding down a snow-covered slope. M.J. \"Jack\" Burchett is credited with first doing this in 1929, using horse reins and clothesline to secure his feet on the plank of wood. Most boardsports have similar, equally unknown origins.\n\nUsing data collected in the past decade, it is estimated there are 18-50 million skateboarders, 5-25 million surfers, and 10-20 million snowboarders in the world. Approximately 100 million people participate in boardsports worldwide.\n\nThere are a variety of board sports, which are characterized by terrain: Surf, Snow, Wake, Skate are the primary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Body blading is similar to roller blading, and in fact a body blader often starts out using the rollers on their feet in the same fashion as roller blades in order to gain initial speed, but then the rider generally assumes a position lying on the stomach facing down the hill. A body blader is capable of reaching very high speeds. Maneuverability is achieved by moving the body into various positions to change direction.\n\n"}

They:\n\nHistorically, cycling shorts were made of knit black wool, which hides wear marks caused by sitting on an oiled leather saddle for extended periods of time, with a chamois leather padding inside the shorts in the crotch area, which reduces chafing from the bicycle saddle. Modern cycling shorts are often made of spandex (Lycra) with a synthetic chamois which acts as an elastic interface between the cyclist's body and the saddle, and are produced in a variety of shapes and styles to suit the needs of different riders. On some cycling shorts different materials are often placed on different parts of the shorts to take advantage of each materials benefit providing a very efficicent cycling short. For example, the patterns used for the chamois on women's cycling shorts tend to be quite different from those used for men's. The hem of each leg is usually lined with elastic and/or silicone that clings to the skin, keeping it in a fixed position. These shorts made from several panels (or cuts of fabric) fit better and are more beneficial, especially for racers, but cost more.\n\nShort-legged elastic tights commonly worn as street wear, under girls skirts and dresses, for gymnastics and ballet practice, or under athletic and running shorts are sometimes also referred to as \"bike shorts\", but they are typically simpler and lighter garments than those worn by cyclists and generally lack the chamois or faux-chamois lining.\n\nBib shorts are cycling shorts that are held up by a bib (integral suspenders/braces) instead of an elastic waistband. Pro and serious riders tend to prefer bib shorts over non-bib shorts due, to the discomfort that often occurs with an elastic waistband, such as tightness (digging into skin) and chafing. The bib part of the short is often made of spandex and polyester with large sections of netting to help keep the rider cool.\nThe idea of modern bib shorts was a development from the braces (UK) or suspenders (US) that cyclists once used to hold up old-fashioned wool shorts, which had a tendency to become loose and heavy from riders' sweat (the use of braces/suspenders meant the shorts could be held up without an uncomfortably tight waistband). Bib shorts are well-suited to tall riders and riders with protruding stomachs because regular shorts can tend to fall down in the back while riding.\n\nThese shorts typically are more loose than bib shorts but still not baggy. This is because they are focused more on protecting the rider during falls and are not as focused on aerodynamic efficiency. The position of the padding is a little different because mountain bikers have a more upright stance when riding. These shorts are different from baggy shorts as they are used by hardcore cyclists who still need the protection with a good padding, which the baggy shorts do not have.\n\nBaggy shorts (or \"shy shorts\") are cycling shorts that look like regular shorts on the outside, but that are designed for cycling. Some have a thin chamois lining on the inside. This lining ranges from polyester fabric to full eight-panel, form-fitting cycling shorts beneath the baggier outside shorts. Others are designed to be worn with a separate liner short underneath. These shorts provide a more casual look when riding around town and off dedicated bike paths. These shorts are basically dual purpose in that the wearer need not to change from tight singular purpose cycling shorts into casual clothes when going out yet have some of the benefits of wearing a cycling short.\n\n"}

{"id": "4330579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4330579", "title": "Friendship Games", "text": "Friendship Games\n\nThe Friendship Games, or Friendship-84 (, \"Druzhba-84\"), was an international multi-sport event held between 2 July and 16 September 1984 in the Soviet Union and eight other socialist states which boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough Friendship Games officials denied that the Games were to be a counter-Olympic event to avoid conflicts with the International Olympic Committee, the competition was often dubbed the Eastern Bloc's \"alternative Olympics\". Some fifty states took part in the competition. While the boycotting countries were represented by their strongest athletes, other states sent their reserve teams, consisting of athletes who failed to qualify for Los Angeles.\n\nOn 8 May 1984, less than three months before the 1984 Summer Olympics were scheduled to begin, the Soviet Union announced its decision to boycott the Games, citing lack of security for Soviet athletes in Los Angeles. The TASS news agency further accused the United States of trying to \"exploit the Games for its political purposes\" stating that the \"arrogant, hegemonic course of the Washington administration in international relations is at odds with the noble ideals of the Olympic movement\".\nIn an article published by the \"London Evening Standard\" several hours before the official announcement, Victor Louis – a Soviet journalist writing for the Western press, thought to be used by the Kremlin as an unofficial means of leaking information to the West – first informed the world of the USSR's decision to boycott, adding that detailed plans for the \"Soviet bloc's alternative games\" had already been made. Louis claimed they would \"probably be announced at the last minute to throw the American organization into chaos\". The article named Bulgaria as the possible host country. On 10 May, Bulgaria became the first Soviet ally to join the boycott, soon followed by East Germany (also 10 May), Mongolia and Vietnam (both 11 May).\n\nLouis wrote another article on 13 May, for the French \"Le Journal du Dimanche\", once again stating that the Soviet Union was contemplating counter-Olympic Games, possibly held in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. However, this time he noted that the idea was unlikely, as the Soviets feared that organizing such an event might prompt the International Olympic Committee to exclude the USSR. On the same day, Soviet sports commentator Vsevold Kuskuskin, during an interview for ABC television program \"This Week with David Brinkley\", said the Eastern Bloc would definitely not organize such games. Also on 13 May, Laos, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan announced their decision to boycott the Los Angeles games.\n\nOn 14 May, Marat Gramov, head of the Soviet Olympic Committee, called a press conference to discuss the boycott. During the conference, Gramov assured \"Moscow would not support any alternative games staged to compete with the Olympics\". On the same day, Poland stated that, while Eastern Bloc officials had vetoed a counter-Olympics idea, the Bloc would instead \"sponsor sports events in various nations as a substitute for participation in the Los Angeles games\", holding them at a different time than the Olympics.\n\nHungary became the ninth country to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics on 16 May, followed by Poland a day later.\n\nOn 20 May, Olaf Brockmann of Austrian newspaper \"Die Presse\", citing Alexander Ushakov, head trainer of the Soviet decathlon team, said Eastern Bloc countries were hastily arranging a series of sports events. Brockmann named five competitions: two track and field athletics meets, one to be held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and the other in East Berlin and Potsdam, East Germany; plus fencing, modern pentathlon and boxing events to be held in Poland. Ushakov reportedly said the events would be held either before or after the Olympics, to avoid conflicts with the IOC, which would ban any form of counter-Olympic Games.\n\nJuan Antonio Samaranch, President of the IOC, held a conference with Olympic Committees of eleven Eastern Bloc countries (eight of the boycotting states – Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, the Soviet Union and Vietnam – plus Cuba, North Korea and Romania) in Prague, Czechoslovakia, starting on 21 May. Samaranch hoped to convince the boycotting states to change their position, but while Romania assured him it would attend the Los Angeles Olympics, the remaining ten countries did not change their stance and even used the meeting to discuss \"their own summer games\". The official announcement was made by Antonin Himl, President of the Czech National Olympic Committee, who appeared on Prague television on 24 May. Himl said that, after the Olympic Games ended, various Eastern bloc countries would hold their own sport events in Olympic disciplines. Himl stated that the games' intention would be to \"give athletes who have conscientiously prepared for the past four years a possibility to sell their abilities\". Thus, the Friendship Games idea was officially proclaimed.\n\nHiml said the games would be held after 12 August (i.e. after the Summer Olympics), and that his country, Czechoslovakia, would host gymnastics, archery, women's handball, and women's track and field athletics. He also gave assurances that the events would be open to all athletes, including those from non-boycotting nations.\n\nSoon after the meeting, Cuba also announced its decision to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics. By the end of June, North Korea, South Yemen, Ethiopia and Angola had done the same.\n\nIn June, the Soviet Union asked Ted Turner and his Turner Broadcasting System to televise the events held in Hungary for American audiences. Turner eventually declined, but assured that his network would give spot coverage to the Games and treat it as any other sporting event.\n\nInitial estimates placed the number of athletes participating in Soviet event venues at approximately 8,000. Later, the number of expected participants was lowered to 2,300, representing 49 countries. However, not all the expected athletes showed up. The exact number of athletes who took part in events held outside of the Soviet Union is unknown.\n\nWhile Olympic-boycotting countries were represented by their strongest athletes, other states sent their reserve teams, consisting of athletes who failed to qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Games began on 2 July with table tennis events held in North Korea, the official opening ceremony was held on 18 August in Moscow, soon after the first events hosted by the Soviet Union started. The two-hour ceremony held at the Central Lenin Stadium included \"girls in white leotards [spinning] red and white beachballs in unison, (...) dozens of children in traditional costumes of the Soviet republics\", a \"squadron of young performers\" which created \"a human weaving machine by ducking and turning to mesh their colored banners\" and \"red-attired teenage girls with silver hula hoops\", which spelled the words 'USSR' and 'peace'. The ceremony was described as being \"reminiscent of Olympic galas\".\n\nAs in Olympic opening ceremonies, a torch bearer (Soviet runner and 1980 gold medalist Viktor Markin) carried the flame into the stadium and lit a giant bowl which had been built for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. The torch had been lit from an eternal flame for World War II victims located in the Kremlin.\n\nTeams marched onto the stadium behind flags, but unlike in the Olympics, they were not national teams but sporting organisations, such as Dynamo or Spartak.\n\nSongs performed during the ceremony included a 1918 military march dedicated to the Red Army, \"Stadium of My Dreams\", written for the 1980 Olympics, and a specially composed song with the chorus \"To a sunny peace – yes, yes, yes / To a nuclear blast – no, no, no.\"\n\nGeneral Secretary Konstantin Chernenko did not attend the ceremony as expected, but five Politburo members were present: Dimitri Ustinov, Mikhail Gorbachev, Grigory Romanov, Vitaly Vorotnikov and Viktor Grishin.\n\nEvents were hosted by nine countries (Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, and the Soviet Union) between 2 July and 16 September 1984. With the exception of equestrian jumping, no events were held during the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (held between 28 July and 12 August).\n\nThe Games were contested in 22 Olympic disciplines (all except association football and synchronized swimming), and in non-Olympic table tennis, tennis, and sambo wrestling. Additionally, the Friendship Games included non-Olympic women's shooting and rhythmic gymnastic events but not women's road race cycling, which became an Olympic event in 1984.\n\nThe Soviet Union won five out of six possible medals.\n\nIn an interview shortly before the events began, the Soviet team's coach Igor Ter-Ovanesyan said his athletes beat more than ten world records during the preparations for the competition. While the Soviet athletes set no new records during the Games, they still dominated, winning more than a half of the gold medals. The only new world record was set by East German Irina Meszynski in women's discus throw, with 73.36 m.\n\nAthletics was the only discipline which saw participation of recent Olympic gold medalists, with American sprinter Alice Brown taking part in women's 100-metre run, and West German Claudia Losch competing in shot put. However, neither won medals.\n\nIn an unusual feat, Alberto Juantorena (Cuba) and Ryszard Ostrowski (Poland) both crossed the finish line at exactly the same moment in the men's 800-metre run. After the officials were unable to decide who came first – even after examining a photograph – both were declared winners.\n\nThe annual Moscow marathon was declared to be a Friendship Games event in 1984. This caused a minor controversy, as the United States Marine guards of the American embassy, who usually took part in it, withdrew after learning it would be treated as a Friendship Games competition.\n\nThe Soviet Union won the men's final against Czechoslovakia 105:70, and Cuba came in third ahead of Poland. The USSR also finished first in the women's event, but since it was a round-robin tournament, there were no semifinals or finals.\n\nThe host nation, Cuba, fully dominated the event, winning eleven out of twelve gold medals. East German Torsten Schmitz in the welterweight category was the only non-Cuban to win gold. Teófilo Stevenson, three-time consecutive Olympic gold medalist who lost the chance to win his fourth gold when Cuba boycotted the Los Angeles Games, won the super heavyweight category.\n\nBoxing was one of just three disciplines in which the Soviet Union did not win a gold medal, the others being modern pentathlon and table tennis.\n\nHosts East Germany and the Soviet Union won all twelve gold medals, six apiece.\n\nThe Schleizer Dreieck in Schleiz, East Germany, usually used as a car or motorcycle race track, served as cycling venue for the individual road race. The event saw participation of top cyclists of the era, including numerous Peace Race veterans such as Uwe Ampler and Uwe Raab.\n\nDiving was yet another event dominated by East Germans and Soviets. Gold medalists included Aleksandr Portnov and Brita Baldus.\n\nEquestrian events were the only discipline contested at the same time as the 1984 Summer Olympics, as jumping events took place between 6 and 10 August. It was also the only discipline in which West German and Italian athletes won medals.\n\nIn individual dressage, Yuri Kovshov won both gold and silver, riding two different horses.\n\nSoviet fencers won most of the men's events, while Hungary won both women's events, thanks to Gertrúd Stefanek and Edit Kovács.\n\nThe Soviet Union \"A\" team won the men's tournament, and while the Soviet Union \"B\" team came in third, fourth-place finishers Zimbabwe were awarded the bronze medal.\n\nA team representing the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan also competed in the men's event, but lost all its matches, including a 0:27 loss to East Germany.\n\nIn artistic gymnastics, Olga Mostepanova achieved perfect \"10\" scores ten times: four in individual competitions, and six in team events. All fifteen medals in rhythmic gymnastics were won by just four athletes: Bulgarians Anelia Ralenkova and Diliana Gueorguieva, and Soviets Galina Beloglazova and Dalia Kutkaitė.\n\nEast Germany won the men's event, thanks to an 18:17 win over the Soviet Union, while Poland came in third. Péter Kovács of Hungary was the top scorer with 26 goals. The USSR finished first in the women's tournament.\n\nThe Soviet Union again won most of the gold medals. The event was also particularly successful for Poland, which won seven medals.\n\nHungarian László Fábián won the individual competition, and Hungary also won the team event.\n\nThe USSR took 11 out of 14 gold medals, while East Germany captured the remaining three.\n\nSailing took place on the Baltic Sea, near Tallinn, Estonian SSR (where the sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics also took place), with the exception of 470 and Finn classes, which were contested on Lake Balaton in Hungary. Soviets and East Germans won all of the gold medals. Canada and Finland won their only Friendship Games medals.\n\nWhile most disciplines mimicked the Olympic Games in terms of events, women's shooting included non-Olympic competitions, namely the 10 metre air pistol and 50 metre rifle three positions events.\n\nFive new world records were set during the competition. Sergei Zabolotnov's result of 1:58.41 in men's 200 metre backstroke excited the crowd, as it was some one and a half seconds better than Rick Carey's result during the Olympics. Fifteen-year-old Sylvia Gerasch of East Germany set the world record in women's 100 m breaststroke and was also part of the relay team that beat the 4 × 100 m medley record.\n\nTable tennis, a non-Olympic sport at that time, was the only event hosted by North Korea, which won four out of seven gold medals. Notably, the People's Republic of China, which was at odds with most socialist states following the Sino-Soviet split, took part in the event.\n\nSoviet players dominated the singles category, and also won the men's doubles event. The Czechoslovakian women's double team was the only non-Soviet team to win gold.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Soviet team finished first in the men's event, over Cuba and Poland. In women's tournament, Cuba won the final against the USSR.\n\nThe Soviet team – composed mostly of the players who won gold during the 1980 Summer Olympics – finished first, while Hungary and Cuba took the second and third spots.\n\nDominated by Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, the event saw thirty world records broken, including two in the super heavyweight category, set by Anatoly Pisarenko.\n\nIn addition to freestyle and Greco-Roman events, non-Olympic sambo wrestling events were also contested. Sambo was the only event hosted by Mongolia.\n\nThe following table is based on statistics from the books \"Na olimpijskim szlaku 1984\" and \"Gwiazdy sportu '84\" and does not include sambo wrestling results.\n\nMedia on both sides of the Iron Curtain frequently compared the results of 1984 Summer Olympics and the Friendship Games. Over sixty Friendship Games results would have secured medals at the Olympic Games. East Bloc athletes outperformed Olympic winners in 20 of 41 track-and-field events and eleven of 29 swimming events. Had Li Yuwei, who won the 1984 Olympic gold medal in 50 metre running target shooting, obtained the same score in the Friendship Games, he would have only placed sixth. Indeed, in events such as weightlifting or wrestling, the Friendship Games had almost all of the top athletes of the time. It is also important to mention that Eastern bloc countries had massive state-sposnored doping programs at the time.\n\nHowever, some journalists noted that making such comparisons was unjustified, because of differing conditions and equipment. For example, Marlies Göhr's result of 10.95 in women's 100 metre run was slightly better than Evelyn Ashford's winning time of 10.97 at the 1984 Olympics, but when the two met head-to-head a week after the Friendship Games, Ashford was much faster than Göhr and set the new world record. Similarly, Eastern Bloc results in track cycling were better than Olympic results, but Friendship Games cyclists competed on an indoor wooden track, while the Olympic events took place on an outdoor concrete track. \"It is like saying Carl Lewis was faster than Jesse Owens, Muhammad Ali would have beaten Joe Louis or Secretariat would have outrun Man o' War\", Sam Lacy of \"The Afro-American\" concluded.\n\nThe comparisons also had political significance. While Friendship Games organizers repeatedly assured the press that their event was not an \"alternative Olympics\", presumably to avoid punitive IOC measures, Soviet state-run media often alluded to such comparisons. The TASS agency declared that the Eastern Bloc's games were a \"major event in the Olympic year\", while the Sovietsky Sport newspaper described the Games as the \"main event of the Olympic quadrennium\". Marat Gramov, head of the Soviet Olympic Committee, said that the \"socialist nations remain faithful to the task of strengthening the unity of the Olympics movement\", while describing the Los Angeles Games as full of \"chauvinism and mass psychosis\".\n\nWhen asked about the Friendship Games, Monique Berlioux, then director of the IOC, said she had \"no reaction whatsoever\" to the competition.\n\nIn 2006, the Law and Justice party in Poland proposed granting Friendship Games medalists sports retirement benefits similar to those given to Olympic medalists. The proposal was never voted upon.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3715006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3715006", "title": "Grandfather rule", "text": "Grandfather rule\n\nThe grandfather rule, in sports which usually only permit participants to play for the team of their country of birth, is an exception which gives participants the option to play for the country of any of their ancestors up to the grandparents. Despite common name for the rule, grandparents of either sex can be invoked equally and it is sometimes referred to as the grandparent rule or the granny rule.\n\nIn rugby league, the RLIF reiterated in 2008 that a player may represent a country if it is their country, or the country of their parents or any of their grandparents' birth.\n\nIn rugby union, regulation 8.1 of World Rugby stipulates that:\na Player may only play for the [Team] (...) of the country with which the Player has a genuine, close, credible and established national link in which:\n(a) he was born; or\nThe term \"grandparent\" was at one time defined to include only blood grandparents, even for individuals who were legally adopted. However, World Rugby's current interpretation of its regulations accounts for cases in which a player, or his or her blood parent, was adopted:\nUnless a Player has been adopted in accordance with the formal, legal requirements of the country concerned, the application of this criterion will be based on a Player’s blood parent. When a Player has been formally adopted in accordance with the applicable legal requirements of the country concerned, the birth place of the Player’s blood parent will no longer be relevant for the purposes of establishing the Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b). The relevant parent will be the parent that has formally and legally adopted the Player. In such circumstances, the relevant grandparents for the purposes of establishing a Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b) will be the Player’s adoptive rather than blood grandparents. It is not possible under Regulation 8.1(b) to assume eligibility via blood grandparents if a Player has been formally and legally adopted. In the event that one of the Player’s blood parents has been adopted, the relevant grandparents for the purpose of establishing that Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b) will be the Player’s blood parent’s adoptive parents. The term “parent” in the Regulations is limited to either a blood parent or a parent that has formally adopted a Player in accordance with the applicable legal requirements of the country concerned.\nThis exception is also incorporated directly into certain national regulations which govern the club-level teams from that country, as shown by regulation 9.14.2.1 of the Irish Rugby Football Union:\nThe following are the registered players who are eligible to play in the All Ireland League and Cup:\nIn association football, this rule can be found at the international level in the statutes of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), in articles 6 and 7. The former states:\nif, in addition to having the relevant\nnationality, he fulfils at least one of the following conditions:\na) He was born on the territory of the relevant Association;\nb) His biological mother or biological father was born on the territory of\nthe relevant Association;\nc) His grandmother or grandfather was born on the territory of the\nrelevant Association; (...)\nNote that unlike World Rugby, which now substitutes adoptive parents for birth parents in determining national team eligibility, FIFA continues to use only biological relations for this purpose.\n\nAmong the most notable countries to have availed of the \"granny rule\" is the Republic of Ireland, where the wide spread of the Irish diaspora left large numbers of potential recruits, especially in the United Kingdom. Jack Charlton (manager 1986–96) was especially noted for recruiting English-born footballers who had Irish ancestry. Many German-born players who have Turkish ancestry have chosen to play for Turkey. This is partly due to Germany's strict rules on dual citizenship which forces German-Turks to choose whether to have German or Turkish citizenship by the age of 23 (in accordance with the German Citizenship Law of 1999).\n\nFIBA, the international governing body for basketball, requires nationality as a precondition for national team selection, but generally does not employ the grandparent rule. The method by which a player obtains citizenship is usually irrelevant to national team eligibility. The only use of the grandparent rule is to determine eligibility to represent the national team of a country's dependent territory, with two notable examples being those of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, both US insular areas with their own national federations, and whose native-born residents are US citizens by birth.\n\nFIBA, however, has a unique restriction on participation of naturalised players in its official competitions that has no parallel in association football or either rugby code. In FIBA competitions, a national team can have no more than one player on its roster who acquired that country's nationality by any means after reaching age 16. This restriction also applies to individuals who had the right to a second nationality at birth, but did not exercise that right until age 16 or later. The latter is relevant to natives of Northern Ireland, who have both British citizenship and the right to Irish citizenship by birth.\n\nA controversial rule, sports fans often debate whether this rule weakens smaller countries by creating the temptation for the best players to abandon their native country and declare elsewhere in the hopes of greater glory, or if on the contrary it helps smaller countries by giving them access to a broader range of players who wouldn't typically be considered to be picked for their country of birth.\n\n"}

Irwindale Speedway\", \"Irwindale Dragstrip\", or \"The House of Drift\") is a motorsports facility located in Irwindale, California, United States. It opened on March 27, 1999 under the official name Irwindale Speedway. Toyota purchased the naming rights to the facility in 2008, and from that time until 2011 it was also known as the Toyota Speedway at Irwindale\"'.\n\nThe speedway features banked, paved 1/2- and 1/3-mile oval tracks and a 1/8-mile drag strip. From its opening until 2011 it was primarily used for NASCAR races such as NASCAR K&N Pro Series West and Whelen All-American Series events. In late 2011, NASCAR announced it was dropping Toyota Speedway from its schedule. The company that manages the track, Irwindale Speedway LLC, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on February 13, 2012.\n\nIn January 2013, it was announced that the track would be re-opening as the Irwindale Event Center, and would operate as a Whelen All-American Series venue for the 2013 season. For the past decade, the Formula D Championship Series has featured sold out events at the venue.\n\nIn 2015, plans were made to demolish Irwindale Speedway and build an outlet mall on the site of the track. As of 2016, the track is still open for business. On August 9, 2017 it was officially announced that Jim Cohan, CEO of Team 211 Entertainment, who operates the track under the name of Irwindale Event Center, would cease operation. On December 29, 2017 it was announced that the track would not close in January 2018 as former Irwindale Late Model driver and track champion Tim Huddleston, along with K&N West owner Bob Bruncatti, bought the speedway to have it remain open for another 5 years.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2010, the main 1/2-mile oval hosted the NASCAR Toyota All-Star Showdown. In this event, the top 30 drivers in the NASCAR K&N Pro Series and the top 40 drivers in the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series come from their respective regional tours to compete in a \"best-of-the-best\" race. The races were televised live on the Speed Channel. It was also the home of the Turkey Night Grand Prix race, a Thanksgiving midget car racing tradition in southern California since 1934, when the race debuted at Gilmore Stadium. Among the 2005 participants were Tony Stewart, Jason Leffler, and J. J. Yeley. It was also seen in an episode of \"Malcolm in the Middle\", titled \"Stock Car Races\" and also used in the opening scene of the pilot episode of \"Fastlane\".\n\nIn 2012, Irwindale Speedway LLC, the management group that ran the track, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on the same day track management canceled the 2012 racing season.\n\nIn the paperwork filed at the United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District, it shows that Irwindale Speedway LLC owed creditors $331,773.11. The largest amount is $150,000 owed on a personal-injury claim.\n\nIrwindale Speedway LLC owed Nu-Way Industries Inc., the company that owns the property where the track and offices are built, $55,000 in rent.\n\nIrwindale Speedway LLC has two more outstanding personal injury claims with unknown values. There is also a debt of $8,093.51 owed to the city of Irwindale Police Department, $16,379.58 owed to the Golden State Water Company and $1,437.50 owed to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune for advertising.\n\nIn late 2012, Jim Cohan, who ran the LA Driving Experience at the track was able to secure funding to re-open the speedway under his management. The track is back on the NASCAR Home Tracks schedule running a bi-weekly schedule for 2013 and up to the present.\n\nIn 2010, they hosted the first Lucas Oil California Classic on Thanksgiving weekend. This was a two-day (Actually 3 due to rain on Saturday night) event for the Spears SRL Southwest Tour, Super Late Models, and Late Models. They will run 125, 100, and 75 laps respectively, for a $50,000+ purse. However, attendance declined in recent years, with only 900 viewers in the stands at a race prior to closure.\n\nThe 1/8-mile drag racing strip opened on September 29, 2001. In 2003, in cooperation with local law enforcement, Irwindale Speedway opened its own dragstrip and hosts legal drag races for street-legal cars, trucks, and motorcycles. The dragstrip is proud to extinguish the \"nowhere else to go\" excuse used by illegal street racers, and local police often hand out flyers to offenders for free entry into drag races at the dragstrip to promote safe racing and has re-opened.\n\nThe venue is also known for drifting events; when it hosted D1 Grand Prix's first overseas event in , with a sell-out crowd attendance of 10,000, it had surpassed all other events Irwindale hosted in the past, the previous being 8,700. Since then, it has become the series regular opening round in February and a non championship event in December and has also hosted a round of the domestic series, Formula D. The venue has been expanded to accommodate 15,000 spectators. The circuit is regarded as one of the most popular courses for crowds and drivers despite the unforgiving concrete wall which drivers usually brush through with their rear bumpers. Because of its popularity, the circuit is nicknamed the \"House of Drift\".\n\nThe 2003 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" lists the fastest-ever top speed of a radio-controlled car as 111 mph (178.63 km/h) set by Cliff Lett of Associated Electrics. Lett, a Team Associated professional driver and one of the designers and developers of the aforementioned RC10, set the record with a heavily modified Associated RC10L3 touring car at Irwindale Speedway on January 13, 2001.\n\nIn September 2013, the property housing the Irwindale Event Center was purchased by Irwindale Outlet Partners, LLC for $22 million. The lease for the Irwindale Event Center continued on a year-by-year basis. In March 2015, plans were made to demolish Irwindale Speedway and replace it with Irwindale Outlet Center, an outlet mall, but the closure has been delayed. The track is currently running the 2017 season. On August 9th, 2017, Cohan made an announcement in an e-mailed statement saying that the track was closing down officially in January 2018. However, on December 29, 2017 it was announced that the track would not close in January 2018 as former Irwindale Late Model racer and track champion Tim Huddleston bought the speedway to have it remain open for another 2 years.\n\n\n\nhttp://la.curbed.com/archives/2013/10/sgvs_irwindale_speedway_will_close_and_be_redeveloped.php\n"}

Its uses are varied. Part is Laleham Golf Club. Part, raised trailer/park homes towards its west, forms residential development; similarly a brief row of houses with private gardens against the Thames. A reservoir and water works is on the island.\n\nFrom at least the year 1278 its historic bulky northern definition formed part of the dominant estate of Laleham across the river, its manor, to which it was linked by a ferry until the early 20th century. Accordingly, as to this section its owner in period from the mid-19th until the early 20th century was the Earl of Lucan; however when its manor house was sold to become Laleham Abbey, a short-lived nunnery, its tenants had taken it over or it was sold for public works. The southern greater part of the land commonly marked today as the Burway or Laleham Burway was the Abbey Mead, kept since the seventh century among many square miles of land and other institutions such as priories, chantries and churches of Chertsey Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. \n\nPart of it was a famous cricket venue in the 18th century and the home of Chertsey Cricket Club. Where not considered for former land ownership reasons with Abbey Mead (being together a large mill-race island with a broad corollary of the river beside them), the old definition of Laleham Burway, in 1911, comprised which were largely for horse and cow pasture.\n\nA notable feature of the 1736 English cricket season was the rise to prominence of Chertsey Cricket Club, playing games against Croydon and London. It is known that two games were played before July that season. One was Croydon v Chertsey at Duppas Hill in Croydon; the other in reverse at the Laleham Burway ground in Chertsey. In each of the two matches, the home team won \"by a great number of runs\". The match at Laleham Burway is the first important one that we know to have been played at this venue.\nNumerous important matches were played at Laleham Burway during the 18th century. Perhaps the most famous (or infamous) was the one in which Thomas White's huge bat caused a furore that led to a change in the Laws of Cricket. This was the Chertsey v Hambledon game on Monday, 23 and Tuesday, 24 September 1771.\n\nThe last important game at the ground may have been Chertsey v Coulsdon in June 1784, but there are doubts about its status. The last definitely known top-class match was therefore Chertsey v Berkshire in September 1783. \n\nLaleham Burway continued to be used for club cricket into the 19th century records of which have been lost. Its club had \"ceased to exist\" by 1856 and its revival began at the Recreation Ground in Chertsey, followed by its present ground, Grove Road, after the First World War.\n\nThe near-triangular bulk of the ground measured as about on the right bank of the Thames in 1911 constitutes its narrow, historical definition to distinguish Laleham Burway's at times separate ownership from Abbey Mead. This north part of the island later thus marked Laleham Burway (also called the Burway) was divided from the Abbey Mead of Chertsey by a seasonal ditch, the Burway Ditch, and by another from the meadow of Mixnams on the north. The triangle was equally Chertsey parish, but belonged to the manor of Laleham. It is mentioned as the Island of Burgh in the original endowment of Chertsey Abbey between 666 and 675, and is described as separated from Mixtenham (or \"Mixnams\") \"by water\", which formed part of the boundary of the abbey lands, but it is not clear which of the two lay within the bounds of the abbey. Tradition says that the Burway originally belonged to Chertsey, and that in a time of great scarcity and famine the inhabitants of Laleham supplied the abbey with necessaries which those of Chertsey could not, or would not provide, in return for which the abbot granted them the use of this piece of ground. Whatever the truth of this story, it is certain that the Abbey of Westminster when holding Laleham manor held land on the Surrey side of the river, and that in the time of Edward I it held part of the meadow called Mixtenham — in a dispute with the abbey of Chertsey in 1278, Westminster agreed to release their right in this meadow in return for 4 acres of pasture contiguous with that which they already held. In 1370 they still held some pasture in Mixtenham. \n\nThe Burway is in a grant of Laleham manor during the 18th century. At the beginning of the 19th century it is described as paying no tithes or taxes to either parish. In 1911 it belonged to owners of estates within the manor of Laleham, and the pasture was divided into 300 parts called 'farrens,' the tenancies of which was granted variously to feed horses or to support cow and a half at £1 17s. 6d. and £1 5s. annually, respectively. If a farren was sold it was worth about £40. The Burway was not inclosed under the Act of 1773 for inclosing the common fields of Laleham Manor in Chertsey, exempted from the Act of 1808 for inclosing Laleham but inclosed under an Act passed in 1813, when the Earl of Lucan, new lord of the manor, acquired by allotment and purchase about .\n\nLaleham Burway (including Abbey Mead, its parent and together forming one main island) is the largest island of the non-tidal course of the River Thames in England upstream of the Tideway — if disqualifying the villages of Dorney and Eton, Berkshire enclosed by the 2002-completed Jubilee River.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1627837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1627837", "title": "Lathi khela", "text": "Lathi khela\n\nLathi khela () is a traditional Bangladeshi martial art – a kind of stick fighting practised mainly in Bangladesh. A practitioner is known as a \"lathial\".\n\nThe word \"lathi\" is the Bengali word meaning stick, while \"khela\" means a sport or game. Therefore, \"lathi khela\" translates as a game of sticks.\n\nThe lathi is normally made of the male bamboo and sometimes bound at short intervals with iron rings. A typical lathi measures 6 to 8 feet (2 to 2.4 m). Some, called bari, are shorter and may be wielded like a baton or bludgeon. In the past, sticks could be paired with shields, as can still be seen in \"nori bari\" (mock stick-fight) demonstrations.\n\nStick fighting has an ancient history in South Asia, tracing back to the region's aboriginal inhabitants. Rich farmers and other eminent people hired \"lathial\" for security and as a symbol of their power. Duels were used as a way to protect or take land and other possessions. A proverb in some South Asian languages is \"whoever wields the lathi keeps the cow\". Zamindars (feudal lords) sent groups of \"lathial\" to forcefully collect taxes from villagers. Lathi training was at one time included in the Bratachari system of education.\n\nAlthough lathi is practised in Indian and Bangladeshi villages, urbanization has led to its decline as a rural martial art in recent decades. Until 1989, an annual nationwide lathi khela convention was held in Kushtia, Bangladesh, where troupes from all over the country took part. Due to the drop in practitioners and spectators, the convention is now held once every three years. Even in the districts where lathi troupes once flourished, only several now remain. Today, lathi khela is most often seen during festivals and weddings. Matches are held in West Bengal for certain puja rituals, and a similar sport called \"chamdi\" is played during Eid in North Bengal.\n\nLathial group performed acts like Baoi Jhak (group fight), Nori Bari (mock fight with sticks), Fala Khela and Dao Khela (mock fight with sharp weapons) and Chhuri dance to music, in the presence of hundreds. These groups may learn the arts of \"dao khela\" (knife fighting) and \"fara khela\" (sword fighting), both of which are preserved today in the form of mock-fights. Matches are generally one-on-one, but the art includes mock-group fights or \"baoi jhak\". In lathi the centre of energy is the heart chakra, and practitioners fight in a more upright position.\n\nThe popularity of lathi khela is waning. Practice of this art form throughout the country can increase its popularity and ensure its continued existence.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "379995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=379995", "title": "Own goal", "text": "Own goal\n\nAn own goal is an event in competitive goal-scoring sports (such as association football or hockey) where a player scores on their own side of the playing area rather than the one defended by the opponent. Own goals sometimes result from the opponent's defensive strength, as when the player is stopped in the scoring area, but can also happen by accident. Since own goals are often added to the opponent's score, they are often an embarrassing blunder for the scoring player, but in certain sports are occasionally done for strategic reasons. \n\nIn some parts of the world, the term has become a metaphor for \"any\" action that backfires on the person/group undertaking it, sometimes even carrying a sense of \"poetic justice\". \n\nA player trying to throw a game might deliberately attempt an own goal. Such players run the risk of being sanctioned or banned from further play.\n\nIn association football, an own goal occurs when a player causes the ball to go into his or her own team's goal, resulting in a goal being scored for the opposition. Defenders often \"turn behind\" dangerous balls into the penalty area, particularly crosses, by kicking or heading the ball out of play behind their goal-line. In this way, the defender's aim is to concede a corner rather than giving attacking players scoring opportunities. Consequently, the defender may misjudge and inadvertently turn the ball into his own goal, particularly if he is under pressure from attacking players who might otherwise score. The defending player who scored the own goal is personally \"credited\" with the goal as part of the statistical abstract of the game. The credit is annotated \"(og)\" to indicate its nature.\n\nThe Laws of the Game stipulate that an own goal cannot be scored directly from most methods of restarting the game; instead, a corner kick is awarded to the attacking team. This is the case for the kick-off, goal kick, dropped-ball (since 2012), throw-in, corner kick, and free kick (indirect and direct). \n\nThe Laws do not stipulate any rules or procedures for crediting goals to players, and indeed such records are not a compulsory part of the game. In 1997 FIFA issued detailed guidelines for crediting own goals, recognising the increasing commercial importance of statistics such as and fantasy football. The guidelines state that credit for scoring is decided by the referee, or match commissioner if present; and \"[a] defender's intervention must be deliberate in order for an own goal to be registered against him\". Regarding a shot which deflects or ricochets into the goal off a defender, some sources credit the score to the attacker; others count them as own goals; for others it depends on whether the original shot was off target; others are more nuanced. There was controversy in 2013 when the FA Premier League credited Tim Howard with an own goal when a shot came off the post, hit him in the back, and went in.\n\nMajor competitions may have video reviews which can alter the accreditation, such as the Dubious Goals Committee of the FA Premier League. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, one of Ronaldo's eight goals in winning the Golden Boot was initially credited as an own goal but reassigned on appeal by Brazil. UEFA's review procedure was formalised in 2008. , the English Football League allowed the club which scored to nominate the scorer, which \"The Guardian\" criticised with an example from 2002: \"every single national newspaper, agency and football factbook agreed that Coventry City defender Calum Davenport had scored an own goal against Burnley. The Clarets, however, gave the goal to Gareth Taylor\".\n\nThe most infamous own goal was by Andrés Escobar of Colombia in the 1994 FIFA World Cup which lost the match against the United States and knocked Colombia out; a week later, Escobar was shot dead in Colombia by a drug gang member whose boss had lost betting on the match.\n\nIf a goal is scored by a player on the defending team, credit for the goal goes to the last player on the other team to have touched the puck; this is because own goals in hockey are typically cases where the player so credited had the shot deflected, but this convention is used even where this is not the case. Occasionally, it is also credited to the closest player to the goal from the other team if he is determined to have caused the opposing player to shoot it into the wrong net. Assists are not awarded on an own goal because the defending team has possession of the puck between any pass and the goal itself. Occasionally in the NHL, players have directed the puck into their own empty net, either late in the game or because of a delayed penalty call. This was the situation which resulted in Billy Smith of the New York Islanders becoming the first goaltender to receive credit for a goal in the NHL. In some parts of Canada, an own goal is referred to as a limoges. The term is believed to have originated in New Brunswick (approximately 1970) and became more common in the greater Toronto region starting in the 1990s.\n\nTreatment of \"own goals\" in field hockey has varied over recent years. In 2013 the International Hockey Federation (FIH) implemented a \"mandatory experiment\" such that a deflection of a shot from outside the shooting circle from a defender would be equivalent to a touch from an attacker, and thus if the shot continued into the goal the score would be counted. This proved unpopular and the change was reversed.\n\nPresently rule 8.1 states that \"A goal is scored when the ball is played within the circle by an attacker and does not travel outside the circle before passing completely over the goal-line and under the crossbar.\" Added clarification: \"The ball may be played by a defender or touch their body before or after being played in the circle by an attacker.\" Thus, an \"own goal\" may occur, but in such situations the goal will likely be credited to the attacker whose initial play into the circle was necessary for the goal to stand.\n\nWhen accidentally scoring at an opposing team's basket (basketball's equivalent of an \"own goal\"), the goal is credited to an offensive player. One typical own-goal scenario occurs when a player tries to block a goal shot but ends up knocking the ball into the goal.\n\nIn NFHS basketball, the two points are merely listed for the scoring team, as a footnote.\n\nIn NCAA basketball, the rules state: \"When a player scores a field goal in the opponent’s basket, it shall count two points for the opponent regardless of the location on the playing court from where it was released. Such a field goal shall not be credited to a player in the scorebook but shall be indicated with a footnote.\"\n\nIn NBA rules, the goal is credited to the player on the scoring team who is closest to defensive shooter and is mentioned in a footnote.\n\nUnder FIBA rules, the player designated captain is credited with the basket.\n\nWhen a ball carrier is tackled or exits the field of play within the end zone being defended by his team, the result is a safety and the opposing team is awarded two points, and receives the ball after a free kick taken at the twenty-yard line. (This does not apply if the ball carrier secures possession of the ball in the end zone as a result of an interception or a kick; in that case, no points are awarded and the play is considered a touchback.) In Canadian football, if a scrimmage kick (punt or missed field goal attempt) is kicked into the end zone and the opponent does not advance it out, the kicking team is awarded a single, worth one point.\n\nA true \"own goal\", in which the team place kicks or drop kicks the ball through their own goal posts (which has never happened at any level in football history and would require either a very strong headwind or a deliberate act of sabotage), is treated as any other backward kick in most leagues' rule books. Backward kicks are treated as fumbles, and as such, a backward kick through the back of the end zone, including through the goal posts, is scored as a safety. This occurred in a 2012 game between two Texas high schools; a punter kicked against a strong wind that blew the ball backward into the end zone, where the defense took control of it.\n\nIn the final minutes of a game, a team may take a deliberate safety in order to get the free kick, rather than punting from the end zone. In 2003, the New England Patriots came back to win a game after giving a safety that put them three points behind. Similarly, the Baltimore Ravens took a safety with twelve seconds left in Super Bowl XLVII instead of punting out of the end zone, cutting their lead to three points but winning the game since they were able to burn eight seconds off the clock with the safety play, and the opposing San Francisco 49ers were unable to score on the ensuing free kick.\n\nIn the 2017 Grey Cup, the Calgary Stampeders deliberately took a safety when their punter Rob Maver, having lost control of a high snap, was faced with loss of down deep in his own territory. He intentionally kicked the ball backwards through the back of his own end zone for a safety.\n\nGaelic footballers can play the ball with their hands; therefore, they have a much greater degree of control over the ball and thus, own goals are much rarer than they are in association football. They do occur, and two were scored by Mayo in the drawn 2016 All-Ireland SFC Final. \n\nAs an own goal is scored when the ball goes under the crossbar, so an \"own point\" is scored (like any other point) when the ball goes over the crossbar. However, when a shot on goal is deflected over the bar by the defending team, the point is credited to the attacker who shot and not considered an \"own point\".\n\nAs a legitimate defensive play, an Australian rules football defender may concede an \"own score\". Such a score, referred to as a \"rushed behind\" and statistically credited to no player (score sheets simply include the tally of rushed behinds), results in the opposition team scoring one point. A defending player may choose to concede a rushed behind when the risk of the opposition scoring a goal (worth six points) is high. It is impossible for a team to concede an own goal worth six points.\n"}

{"id": "5011170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5011170", "title": "Springfield Park (Wigan)", "text": "Springfield Park (Wigan)\n\nSpringfield Park was a multi-purpose stadium in Wigan, Greater Manchester. It was the home ground of Wigan Athletic F.C. until the club moved to the new JJB Stadium (now DW Stadium) after the 1998–99 season. At its largest, the stadium held 40,000. In its 102-year existence the ground only saw 32 years as a Football League venue, 11 years for Wigan Borough F.C. and 21 years for Wigan Athletic FC, before it was demolished to make way for a housing estate in 1999.\n\nThe stadium had previously been home to Wigan County, Wigan United, Wigan Town, and Wigan Borough (previously Wigan United and Wigan Association) as well as Wigan and Springfield Borough rugby league sides. It was also used for horse trotting, as a track cycling velodrome, for wrestling and for athletics.\n\nSpringfield Park was designed by architect Richardson Thomas Johnson and built in 1897 at a cost of £16,000. It was owned by The Wigan Trotting and Athletic Grounds Company Ltd. The first professional football match at the stadium took place in September 1897 when Wigan County played Burton Swifts in a friendly match.\n\nWigan County were the first team to play at Springfield Park. Their greatest event was a 1–0 loss at the hands of Manchester City before their liquidation and extinction three years after their 1897 formation. Wigan United took the lease at Springfield Park in 1901, competing for two seasons in the Lancashire League. After being drawn away to Stalybridge Rovers in the third round of the Rawcliffe Cup, they declined to play due to a waterlogged pitch. However, the referee ruled otherwise, leaving Stalybridge to kick off, dribble and place the ball into the net.Wigan Town would be the third attempt to establish football in Wigan in 1905, but it too would fail to survive for more than three years.\n\nAfter a period of inactivity at Springfield Park due to the First World War, Wigan United beat Fleetwood 2–0 on 6 September 1919 in the West Lancs League. This was the first official game after the war and would lead to the club taking the lease for the ground on 2 December 1919 for the rest of the season. United eventually became Wigan Borough F.C. in 1920 and became one of the founder members of the Football League Third Division North. They won their first game, against Nelson, 2–1 in front of 9,000 spectators. The club's best performance was in 1928–29 when they reached the Third round of the FA Cup. This was to be the largest attendance ever recorded at Springfield Park, with 30,443 spectators watching a 3–1 loss to Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nWigan Borough resigned from the football league during the 1931–32 season. Shortly after Borough went out of business, a new club, Wigan Athletic F.C., was formed and continued to play their home games at Springfield Park. After lengthy negotiations, Wigan Athletic purchased the ground from the owner of Woodhouse Lane Stadium for £2,800 with the proviso that greyhound racing never take place at Springfield Park.\n\nDuring the 1952–53 season, the main stand was razed to the ground by fire, resulting in major fundraising efforts for the construction of a new stand. The following season, a record crowd of 27,526 watched Wigan Athletic beat Hereford United 4–1. To this day, it is the largest attendance ever recorded between two non-league clubs excluding Wembley finals.\n\n19 October 1966 marked the first floodlit match at Springfield Park, when Wigan Athletic played Crewe Alexandra. This was a full year before floodlights were installed at Central Park.\n\nIn October 1978, Zambia –coached by Brian Tiler, himself an ex-Latics manager– became the first national team to play at Springfield Park. Wigan won the game 2–1.\n\nWigan Athletic F.C. moved to the new JJB Stadium after the 1999 season. The final competitive goal to be scored at the stadium was by Manchester City's Paul Dickov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWigan Rugby League team became sub-tenants of Springfield Park (which they shared with Wigan United who had playing preference) playing their first game there on 14 September 1901. A crowd of 4,123 saw them beat Morecambe 12–0. Wigan rugby league team's record crowd at Springfield was 10,111 when they beat Widnes on 19 March 1902. The last game was on 28 April 1902 when Wigan beat the Rest of Lancashire Senior Competition. Wigan then moved to Central Park.\n\nThe only other rugby league team to play at the ground was Springfield Borough who played at Springfield Park for one season in 1987–88. A continuation of Springfield Borough still play under the guise of Blackpool Panthers in League 1.\n\nThe concrete cycle track featured a home straight 29 ft (approx 9m) wide, while the banking was 24 ft wide, rising 7 ft. It was used regularly for competitions; local racing cyclists who raced there included Benjamin Jones, who competed in the 1908 London Olympic Games winning two gold medals.\n\n"}

The race took place at York on 31 May 1851 for a purse of 1,000 sovereigns.\n\nThe Flying Dutchman was a five-year-old, who had won the 1849 Epsom Derby and St Leger and, as a four-year-old, the 1850 Ascot Gold Cup. So dominant had he been that the whip had only been raised on him once, during his Derby victory.\n\nVoltigeur was a year younger, and in 1850 had followed in The Flying Dutchman's hoof prints by taking both The Derby and St Leger (in a rematch after an initial dead heat). In winning the Derby, he had posted a time ten seconds faster than that of The Flying Dutchman the year previously.\n\nTwo days after Voltigeur's St Leger victory, the two horses met for the first time in the Doncaster Cup. The younger horse was in receipt of 19 pounds from his rival and as a result, the previously unbeaten Flying Dutchman went down to a half length defeat, although in some ways the victory was deemed unsatisfactory. Rumours abounded that the Flying Dutchman's jockey, Charles Marlow, was the worse for drink and consequently ignored instructions to wait on the colt, declaring \"I'll show you what I've got under me today!\" and setting a ridiculously fast pace.\n\nIt was subsequently agreed that the two would meet again the following spring for a purse of 2,000 guineas, with each owner putting up half the stake.\n\nThe famous handicapper Henry John Rous set the weights for the second match, giving The Flying Dutchman a weight of 120½ pounds to Voltigeur's 112.\n\nThe race between the two Yorkshire horses proved extremely popular, drawing a crowd of between 100,000 and 150,000, an all-time record for York. Some even walked from as far afield as Richmond, North Yorkshire to be there.\n\nEven the horses' exercise gallops attracted large crowds of fans attempting to assess their relative condition.\n\nUnlike their previous meeting, The Flying Dutchman was successfully restrained in the early stages as Voltigeur, under Nat Flatman, made the running. In the final furlong the Flying Dutchman moved up level with his rival and then pulled ahead to win by a length.\n\nThe event was immortalised in paintings by Harry Hall, first exhibited in Buchanan Street, Glasgow later that year, and John F. Herring, whose work became so famous there was scarcely a village in the British Empire without a copy.\n\nAs for the horses, The Flying Dutchman was retired to stud after the race. Voltigeur, on the other hand, carried on racing. The very day after the match race, he went down to defeat in the Ainsty Hunt Cup, conceding 37 pounds to a classy filly named Nancy.\n\nThe next season, when he was five, he won the race named in honour of his old rival, The Flying Dutchman Handicap, run at York, before finishing unplaced in his final three racecourse appearances, including the Ascot Gold Cup, and then retiring to stud himself.\n"}

It was a never included in a commercial release.\n\n\"Series Six, Episode Six\"\n\nHammond and May raced Clarkson (in a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren) from Heathrow airport to Oslo, Norway. May and Hammond flew to Newcastle, then took the ferry across the North Sea to Kristiansand, Norway and used a speedboat to get to Oslo. Clarkson, in the McLaren Mercedes, had to drive over 1,300 miles (about 2,100 km) through the UK, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark (stopping to rest overnight), Sweden, and Norway. On the way from Kristiansand to Oslo, aspiring to their first epic race win, the engine on Hammond and May's speedboat burnt out while the back-up chase boat's hull was damaged—all while Hammond was getting seasick over the side of the boat—severely spoiling their lead. They had to land in an unknown town (Stavern, in Larvik), taking nearly a day to find a bus and get to the destination—leaving Clarkson to win the race, fly back to England, get home, and be halfway through supper before Hammond and May arrived at the destination.

Hammond and May rode scooters to the local airport, and planned to fly directly to London, but had to fly via the French Riviera since the aircraft was not equipped to fly over mountains above 10,000 feet—in this case, the Swiss Alps. While catching up to Clarkson, May had to land in Lille, as he was not licensed to fly at night. From Lille, May & Hammond took the Eurostar to London, and then a bus for the final leg of the journey.

A much shorter version was included on the \"Top Gear: The Races\" DVD.\n\n\"Series Nine, Episode Seven.\"\n\nClarkson and May drove a modified Toyota Hilux against Hammond, Matty McNair and a dog sled team in a race across the Canadian arctic. Clarkson and May won the race, and became part of the first successful attempt to drive a motor vehicle to the North Magnetic Pole. Winner: Car\n\nDVD Release: A director's cut of this race was released on Blu-ray. The televised version was released as part of the \"Top Gear: The Great Adventures 1\" DVD box set.\n\n\"Series Ten, Episode Five\"\n\nMay (in a Mercedes-Benz GL-Class) raced Hammond (on a Specialized Sirrus Limited hybrid bicycle), The Stig (using the London public transport system), and Clarkson (in a Cougar motorboat) from Kew across to London City Airport. The Stig started on a bus, then got on the Tube before taking the DLR. Hammond took the lead from the start, although traffic lights meant May remained close behind. The speed limit of 9mph on much of the River Thames put Clarkson firmly in last place. Congestion at Picadilly let Hammond shake off May, who was further slowed after the Metropolitan Police stopped him to check the camera car's permit. With Hammond 8 miles from the airport, Clarkson passed under Wandsworth Bridge, at which point the Thames had no speed limit. He therefore shot past May and the Stig, but was shocked to discover Hammond had still won by a fair margin. The Stig arrived a short while later, beating May by 15 minutes. Despite the result shown in the film, the presenters mockingly denied this outcome (by saying things such as Hammond crashing into railings and Clarkson's boat exploding), and insisted that May in the Mercedes-Benz won the race fairly. Winner: Bicycle\n\nDVD Release: This race was released as part of the Season 10 box set. It was also released as part of the \"Top Gear: The Challenges 2\" DVD.\n\n\"Series Eleven, Episode Four\"\n\nClarkson drove a Nissan GT-R through Japan, from Hakui, Ishikawa to Mount Nokogiri, while Hammond and May took public transport—most notably the 188 mph Shinkansen. First they took a limited express train from Hakui to Kyoto, before getting on the bullet train to Shin-Yokohama, they then had to take the Yokohama Subway to Yokohama Station, where they got on the suburban train to Kurihama and caught the bus to the ferry. While in Tokyo, Clarkson accidentally turned off the satnav system in the GT-R and struggled to turn it back on as the system only spoke Japanese, costing him 45 minutes. By the time he had managed to turn it back on, Hammond and May had taken the lead. However, May and Hammond were temporarily separated when their train split. They eventually regrouped when Hammond asked May to hold the bus. May and Hammond then crossed Tokyo Bay on a ferry, from which they used folding bicycles (carried in their suitcases) to the cable car, which got them up to the top of Mount Nokogiri; however Clarkson had already made it to the summit, just 3 minutes before them.

It was also released as part of the \"Top Gear: The Challenges 3\" DVD.\n\n\"Series Twelve, Episode Four\"\n\nWith the team booked to switch on the famous Blackpool Illuminations, the three were presented with a challenge to determine which of them would get the honour of pulling the switch. This took the form of a race from Basel to Blackpool, taking a route of their choice and using any unmodified production car, the only restriction being that they could only use a single tank of fuel. All three presenters chose diesel vehicles - May a Subaru Legacy, Hammond a Volkswagen Polo BlueMotion, to the scorn of his compatriots, and Clarkson a Jaguar XJ. He had dismissed the race as pointless, since the figures indicated no production car at the time could make the distance, and therefore decided to \"fail in style and comfort\". Finally, the Stig was dropped off in Blackpool to pull the switch if no-one arrived.\n\nEach presenter took different routes across France. Hammond opted for the shortest possible, while May added 30 miles to avoid mountains and several towns. Clarkson headed straight for the nearest motorway and drove \"like a loony\", heating seats, charging his phone and running the radio in the hope of emptying his fuel tank in France. After initially struggling with consumption, both Hammond and May realized their pace was too slow, and decided to pick up speed. May caught up with Hammond, and the two began an overtaking duel all the way to Calais, arriving 40 minutes behind Clarkson.\n\nThe presenters had also chosen different routes across England. Hammond again opted for the shortest, via the M1 and M6. May decided to avoid the risk of M6 traffic by heading along the M1 up to Leeds, then switching to the M62. Clarkson chose to use the M40, with his theoretical route changing to the M6 at Birmingham, although he was really trying to run out of fuel near his house. Despite his fuel-wasting, he passed Oxford with a considerable level remaining, and slowed down, finally taking the race seriously. When Hammond found out that Clarkson was still running, he picked up speed and overtook the Jaguar on the M6 toll. Given his near-empty tank, Clarkson decided to remain economical until his range reached 0, as Hammond's charge had reduced the BlueMotion's range drastically.\n\nWith May out of the running due to his slow speed and a trouble-free M6, Hammond's theoretical range reached 0. Once the Jaguar did the same, Clarkson accelerated to catch Hammond. However, his charge was too late, as Hammond was greeted with a police escort just outside Blackpool. Clarkson arrived less than a minute later. May did eventually finish, albeit 40 minutes after the celebration ended. With seconds to go before the switch-on, Richard—despite winning—claimed Jeremy should switch the light, and in the ensuing argument, the Stig pulled the switch. Afterwards, it was found Clarkson's car had 120 miles of fuel left, giving the Jaguar a range of nearly 900 miles. Hammond and May both admitted that despite the Polo arriving first, the Jaguar was to be declared the \"real\" winner. Winner: Jaguar XJ\n\nDVD Release: This race was released as part of the Season 12 box set.\n\n\"Series Twelve, Episode Five\"\n\nHammond drove a Ferrari Daytona against May and his co-driver in an XSR 48 powerboat from Portofino to Saint-Tropez. Both were stopped by the Italian police at different points to check documents, with Hammond having to follow the police to a nearby police station. This probably led May to winning the race. Winner: Boat\n\nDVD Release: This race was released as part of the Season 12 box set. It was also released as part of the \"Top Gear: The Challenges 4\" DVD.\n\n\"Series Thirteen, Episode One\"\nOn 25 April 2009, the BBC filmed a private charter train hauled by the brand new steam locomotive 60163 \"Tornado\". Clarkson (on the train) raced May (in a 1949 Jaguar XK120) and Hammond (on a 1949 Vincent Black Shadow motorcycle) from London King's Cross to Edinburgh Waverley. \"Tornado\" completed the run in exactly 8 hours, with four stops for water, while May and Hammond were restricted to the A1 Road (as no motorways existed yet in 1949).

It was also released as part of the \"Top Gear: The Challenges 4\" DVD.\n\n\"Series Nineteen, Episode Three\" (10 February 2013)\n\nClarkson raced Hammond and May from Wembley Stadium to the San Siro in Milan, where the winner would get a free ticket to watch AC Milan play Anderlecht in the UEFA Champions League. Clarkson however was restricted to any car he liked which cost no more than £35,000. He decided to drive a Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 while Hammond and May travelled by public transport. They took a combination of bus and commuter train to St. Pancras International, where they then took an early Eurostar train to Paris Gare du Nord. On arrival, they took a metro train across Paris to Gare de Lyon before taking a TGV to Milan. They then took the Milan Metro to Lotto Fiera before running to the stadium. With only one ticket up for grabs, Hammond and May raced each other to the finish line. May, who refused to run on television, produced a foldable bicycle out of his bag in hopes of outpacing his colleague. Hammond on foot was nonetheless faster and took the ticket. After the race Clarkson blamed French roadworks for losing him the race. This is the only Top Gear long-distance race in which car is beaten by public transport. Winner: Train\n\nDVD Release: This race was released as part of the Season 19 box set.\n\n\"Series Twenty, Episode One\"\n\nClarkson tried to prove that fossil fuels are still superior to alternatives, and raced a blue 1.8L Toyota Auris against May in an AC45 Sailing Boat, helmed by Olympian Ben Ainslie, and crewed by America's Cup winners. The race was in New Zealand, from Fletcher Bay at the top of the Coromandel Peninsula to Spirits Bay in Northland.\n\nWhen a baffled May questioned his choice of vehicle, Clarkson explained that it was a hire car, which he claimed made it the fastest in the world because he could redline it until he crashed it.\n\nClarkson had to drive south on the Coromandel Peninsula before he could turn north towards Northland, making his journey 410 miles, over May's direct route of 220 miles. During the race Clarkson heavily abused his car and rendered it undriveable after crashing into a stone wall to avoid a tractor. He was forced to stop, visit a hire car centre, and exchange his broken Auris for another - then hope that May did not notice that his car was now red. May was constantly battered by the rough seas, and lost his satellite phone during the race after being hit by a large wave.\n\nDespite trying to make up ground by using 90 Mile Beach, Clarkson was beaten to the finish line by May, who had a lead of an hour over the car. Also, May noticed that the car was no longer blue at the end of the race. Winner: Sailing Boat\n\n\"Series Twenty Two, Episode One\"\n\nThe presenters decide to redo the race they did in London between all of them, this time travelling across St. Petersburg. Clarkson selects a hovercraft, Hammond chooses a £9,000 (Pinarello Dogma F8) bicycle, May picks a Renault Twizy, and the Stig again relies on public transport. From the start, neither Hammond or Clarkson have it easy with their choice of transport. Clarkson found driving his hovercraft – which he called a Russian design of the presenters' Hovervan – to be quite difficult; along with his instruments and controls being in Russian, he could not keep the craft pointing forward or in a straight line. Meanwhile, Hammond, while managing to overtake and then be overtaken by May, ran afoul of the city's tramlines. Hammond caught a wheel in one of the rails and fell, shearing off the bicycle's derailleur and rendering it useless. The others continued racing and Hammond soon re-entered the race on a second bike, which was borrowed from a passer-by (who was given a lift to his work as compensation).\n\nMay, meanwhile, suffered no issues whatsoever, and so was able to enjoy the car he was driving. He remarked how he liked the fact that it was designed for European cities, having two seats in tandem, an electric engine, and scissor doors. However, as he reached the city-centre, he discovered that the city's streets and roads were much wider than he expected them to be. Clarkson, who managed to gain the lead despite the handling issues, soon hit the city-centre, where he attempted to use narrow, peaceful canals to avoid the heavy river traffic he encountered. Unfortunately for him, this led him towards low bridges instead, which required him to deflate the hovercraft's skirts repeatedly to squeeze under the bridges. Although his new bicycle was slower and less comfortable than his first mount, Hammond began to catch up to May and Clarkson.\n\nClarkson and Hammond soon reached the finish line, with Hammond coming in just moments after Clarkson, only to find that both had been beaten by May, who was waiting in hiding for them. While they commented that the car had redeemed itself in the race, they realised that one of them was missing. The Stig, who had suffered no major issues when using public transport, failed to finish in the end: he had spotted a Porsche 911 and was banging his helmet against the fence that protected it. Winner: Car\n\n\"Series Twenty Four, Episode Four\"\n\nMatt and Harris are competing against each other in a race from Dubai to a mountaintop hotel in Oman. Harris drives the Bugatti Chiron while Matt takes a combination of luxury transports: a motorboat, a luxury car, a private jet and a sports bike. Early in the race, Harris faced rush hour traffic while Matt was stuck on a 5-knot speed limit zone. As traffic cleared, Harris was escorted out of Dubai by the Dubai Police Force while Matt cleared the marina, enabling him to get the boat to speed before entering the second stage, which was being chauffeured in a Bentley Mulsanne EWB by the Stig's \"Emirati cousin\", but is stuck in Dubai's downtown district, falling 100 miles behind Harris. However, Harris was stuck immediately upon entering Oman as the Chiron had to be re-registered while Matt arrived at the airport to board the HondaJet to Muscat, enabling him to gain significant ground despite the 100 mile distance between Muscat and the finish line. Meanwhile, Harris attempts to take a shortcut through a network of alleyways at a town, slowing his progress significantly. In Muscat, Matt's entered the fourth and final stage of his journey, riding the Ducati 1299 Superleggera. At the final leg of the race, both entered the mountains from opposite direction, leading to a tense final sprint. Winner: Alternative \"money no-object\" transportation\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4987177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4987177", "title": "Vertical jump", "text": "Vertical jump\n\nA vertical jump or vertical leap is the act of raising one's center of mass higher in the vertical plane solely with the use of one's own muscles; it is a measure of how high an individual or athlete can elevate off the ground (jump) from a standstill. \n\nThe vertical jump is divided into two different types: \nIn general, the standing vertical jump is the one that is used as an official measurement for athletes.\n\nVertical jump measurements are used primarily in athletic circles to measure performance. The most common sports in which one's vertical jump is measured are track and field, netball, basketball, football, and volleyball, but many sports measure their players' vertical jumping ability during physical examinations. In addition, single and multiple vertical jumps are occasionally used to assess muscular strength and anaerobic power in athletes.\n\nThe simplest method to measure an athlete's vertical jump is to get the athlete to reach up against a flat wall, with a flat surface under his/her feet (such as a gym floor or concrete) and record the highest point he/she can reach flat-footed (the height of this point from the ground is referred to as \"standing reach\"); fingertips powdered with chalk can facilitate the determination of points touched on the wall. The athlete then makes an effort to jump up with the goal of touching the highest point on the wall that he or she can reach; the athlete can perform these jumps as many times as needed. The height of the highest point the athlete touches is recorded. The difference between this height and the standing reach is the athlete's vertical jump.\n\nThe method described above is the most common and simplest way to measure one's vertical jump, but other more scientifically accurate methods have been devised. A pressure pad can be used to measure the time it takes for an athlete to complete a jump, and then using a kinematics equation (h = g × t/8), the computer can calculate his or her vertical jump based on the time in the air.\n\nA second, more efficient and correct method is to use an infrared laser placed at ground level. When an athlete jumps and breaks the plane of the laser with his/her hand, the height at which this occurs is measured. Devices based on United States Patent 5031903, \"A vertical jump testing device comprising a plurality of vertically arranged measuring elements each pivotally mounted...\" are also common. These devices are used at the highest levels of collegiate and professional performance testing. They are composed of several (roughly 70) 14-inch prongs placed 0.5 inches apart vertically. An athlete will then leap vertically (no running start or step) and make contact with the retractable prongs to mark their leaping ability. This device is used each year at the NFL scouting combine.\n\nAn important component of maximizing height in a vertical jump is attributed to the use of counter-movements of the legs and arm swings prior to take off, as both of these actions have been shown to significantly increase the body’s center of mass rise. The counter-movement of the legs, a quick bend of the knees which lowers the center of mass prior to springing upwards, has been shown to improve jump height by 12% compared to jumping without the counter-movement. This is attributed to the stretch shortening cycle of the leg muscles enabling the muscles to create more contractile energy. Furthermore, jump height can be increased another 10% by executing arm swings during the take off phase of the jump compared to if no arm swings are utilized. This involves lowering the arms distally and posteriorly during the leg counter-movements, and powerfully thrusting the arms up and over the head as the leg extension phase begins. As the arms complete the swinging movement they pull up on the lower body causing the lower musculature to contract more rapidly, hence aiding in greater jump height. Despite these increases due to technical adjustments, it appears as if optimizing both the force producing and elastic properties of the musculotendinous system in the lower limbs is largely determined by genetics and partially mutable through resistance exercise training.\n\nVertical jumps are used to both train and test for power output in athletes. Plyometrics are particularly effective in training for power output, and include vertical jumps of different types in their protocol. In one recent study, training with plyometrics (which included continuous vertical jumps) was shown to improve jump height and boost vertical jump performance to similar degrees in combination with very different resistance training protocols, indicating that the plyometric jumping contributed to the increased jump height more than resistance training. Research into plyometric jumps found vertical jumps to be among the highest in terms of muscle recruitment (as measured by electromyography), power output, and ground reaction force produced.\nFatigue has been researched in athletes for its effect on vertical jump performance, and found to decrease it in basketball players, tennis players, cyclists, rugby players, and healthy adults of both genders.\n\nThis is the vertical jump test scores by gender.\n"}
