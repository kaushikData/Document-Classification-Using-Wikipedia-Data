He was born in Newville, Pennsylvania and attended Washington & Jefferson College. He played professionally for the Baltimore Orioles in the season. In 27 professional games that year, he had 77 at-bats with 17 hits and one home run.\n\nHe batted and threw right-handed. He was small in stature and was an excellent fielder, but not a good hitter. Even so, he was difficult to pitch to, since he would crouch \"pretzel-like\" in the batter's box to make his strike zone smaller. He died in East Pennsboro Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1953, sportswriter Jocko Maxwell published an article in \"Baseball Digest\" describing the shortest home run in baseball history. Maxwell described a baseball game where Oyler, as a shortstop for the Minneapolis Millers, was crouched in the batters' box in the bottom of the 9th and ducked to avoid a pitch thrown at his head. The ball hit off of Oyler's bat, which was still resting on his shoulder, and became stuck in the mud in front of home plate. Oyler was able to complete an inside-the-park home run before any opposing players were able to find the ball. Maxwell's article indicated that the story was originally told by WWRL radio station in Woodside, New York. This story was repeated by sportswriter Bill Bryson, Sr. in \"Baseball Digest\" in 1958. Another version of the story, as told by Halsey Hall, had Oyler chopping at a low pitch and sticking the ball into the mud 5 feet from home plate.\n\nBaseball historian Stew Thornley is skeptical of the story of Oyler's home run, pointing out that no contemporary news reports described the incident. Other modern reference sources recount the story without caveat.\n\nThe story was the subject of a book of baseball lore by Michael G. Bryson called \"The Twenty-Four-Inch Home Run.\" It was also the inspiration for the children's book, \"Mudball\" by Matt Tavares, which won the 2005 Parents' Choice Awards Gold Award. In the \"Author's Note\" Tavares describes the story of Oyler's home run as being folklore.\n\n"}

Bear canisters are seeing increased popularity in areas where bears have become habituated to human presence, and are required in some regions such as Yosemite National Park in the United States.\n\nA bear canister typically weighs between 2-4 lb (1-2 kg), and has a storage capacity of 400 - 900 in (6 - 15 liters). The actual capacity in number of days of hiking food stored varies with the appetite of the hiker, the selection of food, and the skill in which it is packed, but a 700 in canister likely holds up to a week's worth of food for the average hiker.\n\nHard-sided bear cans employ such materials as polycarbonate, ABS plastic, carbon fiber, and aluminum in their construction. An effective canister must resist both the tremendous strength and high intelligence of an attacking animal. Most containers are too large for a bear to simply pick up and carry away.\n\nThe lid of a canister is usually recessed in order to prevent it being pried off, and tool use, or at least an advanced degree of motor skills, is required to remove it. Some bear canisters contain gaskets that block the scent from escaping the container.\n\nAt least one model of soft-sided \"bear bag\" is made from Spectra (UHMWPE) fabric. While a soft-sided container may prevent a bear from eating its contents, the food inside is likely to be reduced to purée in the attempt. A newer model comes with an aluminum stiffener that protects the contents more effectively than the bag alone.\n\nA few national parks and national forests require backcountry visitors to carry \"approved\" food storage containers. Backpackers who ignore this policy may face fines, property impounded, or eviction from the wilderness. Rangers may stop hikers and require them to produce their containers for inspection.\n\nThe Sierra Interagency Black Bear Group (SIBBG) and the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee regulate the approval of food storage containers in parts of the western United States. Containers effective against the American black bears in the Sierra Nevada may not be effective against the grizzly bears found elsewhere. SIBBG conducts visual inspection and various structural tests, then containers are filled with food and left in the cages of captive black bears in a zoo in California. If the canister survives the zoo test, it is then \"conditionally\" approved. Full approval is only given after three months of successful field tests by users.\n\nIt is recommended that canisters be left on the ground, at least 100 feet /30 metres from the campsite. Suspending the canister can allow the bear to smash it to the ground or use the suspension gear to carry it away. To prevent a bear from rolling it away, the container could be left in a bush, a shallow depression, or wedged between rocks or logs. Placing the canister near water could allow the container to float away. Reflective tape and labelling the container helps in recovery.\n\nAn alternative is \"bear bagging\", wherein items attractive to a bear such as food or other perishables are placed in a bag and then raised into the air using a rope — out of reach of a bear. The rationale is that bears, being unable to reach the food, are less drawn to campsites and pose less of a threat to campers and their equipment.\n\nLightweight nylon stuff sacks are often used for bear bags, but they can be made simply of a large enough square or rectangular piece of cloth or tarp with the food items placed in the center of the tarp and the corners brought up and tied around with rope. The rope is then used to tie the bag in the air where it cannot be reached from the ground or from a tree by a bear. Often this is done by tying another length of rope tightly between two trees or other tall objects. In problem areas, a bear bag should be at least 12 feet (3.5 m) high and 10 feet (3 m) from any vertical support. The counterbalance method, Marrison system, and the Pacific Crest Trail method are a few different techniques to use when hanging a bear bag.\n\nIn areas where trash cannot be burned (much of the United States and especially during dry seasons) and no fortified trash containers are available, trash may also be raised in a separate bear bag to keep the food smells from attracting bears.\n\nIn severe problem areas for bears, such as a majority of Yosemite National Park, bear bagging is ineffective and has been banned.\n\nYellow-Yellow, a wild 125-pound black bear in the Adirondacks near North Elba, New York, had figured out how to open several models of the BearVault, an approved container. Other bears there have reportedly also learned the skill, but those suspicions have not been confirmed. For a period, the manufacturer discouraged use of the BearVault in the bears' territory.\n\n"}

{"id": "397713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=397713", "title": "Darts", "text": "Darts\n\nDarts is a sport in which small missiles are thrown at a circular dartboard fixed to a wall. Though various boards and rules have been used in the past, the term \"darts\" usually now refers to a standardised game involving a specific board design and set of rules. As well as being a professional competitive game, darts is a traditional pub game, commonly played in Britain and Ireland, across the Commonwealth, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, the Scandinavian countries, the United States, and elsewhere.\n\nDarts were historically used in warfare in ancient history; skirmishers used darts of varying sizes, similar to miniature javelins. It was the practice of this skill that developed into a game of skill.\nBefore the First World War, pubs in the United Kingdom had dartboards made from solid blocks of wood, usually elm. They had to be soaked overnight to heal the holes made by the darts, and it was a messy business for the publican, although darts was a popular game. This changed when a company called Nodor, whose primary business was making modelling clay (which has no odour, hence the name Nodor), started producing clay dartboards in 1923. The clay dartboards never caught on, and Nodor switched to making the traditional elm dartboards that were popular at the time. Their model of dartboard was not a great success until someone came up with the idea of using the century plant to make a dartboard. Small bundles of sisal fibres of the same length were bundled together. The bundles were then compressed into a disk and bound with a metal ring. It was an instant success, as the darts did little or no damage to the board—they just parted the fibres when they entered the board; this type of board was more durable and required little maintenance.\n\nQuality dartboards are still made of sisal fibres; less expensive boards are sometimes made of cork or coiled paper. However, several types of sisal fibre are used in dartboards today, originating from East Africa, Brazil, or China. Despite widespread belief that some dartboards are constructed using pig bristles, camel hair, or horse hair, there is no evidence that boards have ever been produced commercially from these materials.\n\nA regulation board is inches (451 mm) in diameter and is divided into 20 radial sections. Each section is separated with metal wire or a thin band of sheet metal. The best dartboards have the thinnest wire, so that the darts have less chance of hitting a wire and bouncing out. The numbers indicating the various scoring sections of the board are also normally made of wire, especially on tournament-quality boards. The wire ring on which the numbers are welded can be turned to facilitate even wear of the board. Boards of lesser quality often have the numbers printed directly on the board.\n\nIn the late '70s, companies devised and began producing electronic dartboards. These dartboards have electronic scoring computers that are preprogrammed with a wide variety of game types. The board is made of plastic facings with small holes. The holes slant out, allowing the plastic-tipped darts to stick inside. When a dart strikes the board, the section makes contact with a metal plate, telling the computer where the player has thrown. These \"soft-tip\" darts and automated boards greatly increased the game's popularity in the United States.\n\nIllumination should be arranged to brightly illuminate the dartboard and minimize shadows of thrown darts.\nThe main supply for the illumination should be protected against accidental piercing, or placed away from the board.\n\nThe dartboard may have its origins in the cross-section of a tree. An old name for a dartboard is \"butt\"; the word comes from the French word \"but\", meaning \"target\". In particular, the Yorkshire and Manchester Log End boards differ from the standard board in that they have no triple, only double and bullseye, the Manchester board being of a smaller diameter, with a playing area of only 25 cm (9.84 in) across with double and bull areas measuring just 4 mm (0.157in.). The London Fives board is another variation. This has only 12 equal segments numbered 20, 5, 15, 10, 20, 5, 15, 10, 20, 5, 15, 10 with the doubles and trebles being a quarter of an inch (6.35mm) wide.\n\nThere is a speculation that the game originated among soldiers throwing short arrows at the bottom of a cask or at the bottom of trunks of trees. As the wood dried, cracks would develop, creating \"sections\". Soon, regional standards emerged and many woodworkers supplemented bar tabs by fabricating dart boards for the local pubs.\n\nIt is generally said that the standard numbering plan with a 20 on top was created in 1896 by Lancashire carpenter Brian Gamlin, though this is disputed. However, a great many other configurations have been used throughout the years and in different geographical locations. Gamlin's layout was devised to penalise inaccuracy. Although this applies to most of the board, the left-hand side (near the 14 section) is preferred by beginners, for its concentration of larger numbers. Mathematically, removing the rotational symmetry by placing the \"20\" at the top, there are 19!, or 121,645,100,408,832,000 possible dartboards. Many different layouts would penalise a player more than the current setup; however, the current setup actually does the job rather efficiently. There have been several mathematical papers published that consider the \"optimal\" dartboard.\n\nInitially the missiles were simply cut down arrows or crossbow bolts. The first purpose-made darts were manufactured in one piece from wood; wrapped with a strip of lead for weight and fitted with flights made from split turkey feathers. These darts were mainly imported from France and became known as French darts. Metal barrels were patented in 1906 but wood continued to be used into the 1950s.\nThe first metal barrels were made from brass which was relatively cheap and easy to work. The wooden shafts, which were now threaded to fit the tapped barrel, were either fletched as before or designed to take a paper flight. This type of dart continued to be used into the 1970s. When the advantages of using plastic were realised, the shaft and flight became separate entities, although one piece moulded plastic shaft and flights were also available.\n\nModern darts have four parts: the points, the barrels, the shafts and the flights. The steel points come in 2 common lengths, 32mm and 41mm and are sometimes knurled or coated to improve grip. Others are designed to retract slightly on impact to lessen the chance of bouncing out.\n\nThe barrels come in a variety of weights and are usually constructed from brass, silver-nickel, or a tungsten alloy. Brass is cheap but light and therefore brass barrels tend to be very bulky. Tungsten on the other hand, is twice as dense as brass thus a barrel of an equivalent weight could be thirty percent smaller in diameter. Tungsten is very brittle however and so an alloy of between 80 and 95 per cent tungsten is used. The remainder is usually nickel, iron, or copper. Silver-nickel darts offer a compromise between density and cost.\n\nBarrels come in 3 basic shapes: cylindrical, torpedo, or ton. Cylindrical barrels are the same diameter along their entire length and so tend to be long and thin. Their slenderness makes them better for grouping but because they are long, the centre of gravity is further back. Ton shaped barrels are thin at either end but bulge in the middle. This makes them fatter than a cylindrical barrel of equivalent weight but the centre of gravity is further forward and so theoretically easier to throw. Torpedo shaped barrels are widest at the point end and taper towards the rear. This keeps the weight as far forward as possible but like the ton, gives it a larger diameter than the cylinder.\n\nThe shafts are manufactured in various lengths and some are designed to be cut to length. Shafts are generally made from plastics, nylon polymers, or metals such as aluminium and titanium; and can be rigid or flexible. Longer shafts provide greater stability and allow a reduction in flight size which in turn can lead to closer grouping; but they also shift the weight towards the rear causing the dart to tilt backwards during flight,requiring a harder, faster throw. A longer shaft will however make the dart less responsive and increase the chance of \"wobbling\".\n\nThe primary purpose of the flight is to produce drag and thus prevent the rear of the dart overtaking the point. It also has an effect on stability by reducing wobble. Modern flights are generally made from plastic, nylon, or foil and are available in a range of shapes and sizes. The three most common shapes in order of size are the standard, the kite, and the smaller pear shape. The less surface area, the less stability but larger flights hamper close grouping. Some manufactures have sought to solve this by making a flight long and thin but this in turn creates other problems such as changing the dart's centre of gravity. Generally speaking a heavier dart will require a larger flight.\n\nThe choice of barrel, shaft, and flight will depend a great deal on the individual player's throwing style. For competitive purposes a dart cannot weigh more than 50g including the shaft and flight and cannot exceed a total length of 300mm.\n\nThe WDF uses the following standards for play:\n\nHeight - the dart board is hung so that the centre of the bulls eye is 5 ft 8 inches (1.73 m) from the floor. This is considered eye-level for a six-foot man.\n\nDistance - the oche (line behind which the thrower must stand) should be 7 ft 9¼ inches (2.37 m) from the face of the board. If the face projects outward from the wall, due to the thickness of the board and/or a cabinet in which it is mounted, the oche must be moved back appropriately to maintain the required distance.\n\nThe regulations came about due to the United Kingdom and the rest of the world playing at different lengths, with 7 ft 9¼ inches (2.37 m) being the compromised length.\n\nThe standard dartboard is divided into 20 numbered sections, scoring from 1 to 20 points, by wires running from the small central circle to the outer circular wire. Circular wires within the outer wire subdivide each section into single, double and triple areas. The dartboard featured on the \"Indoor League\" television show of the 1970s did not feature a triple section, and according to host Fred Trueman during the first episode, this is the traditional Yorkshire board.\n\nVarious games can be played (and still are played informally) using the standard dartboard. However, in the official game, any dart landing inside the outer wire scores as follows:\n\nThe highest score possible with three darts is 180, commonly known as a \"ton 80\" (100 points is called a ton), obtained when all three darts land in the triple 20. In the televised game, the referee frequently announces a score of 180 in exuberant style. A \"quad\" ring appeared briefly between the triple ring and the bull in the 1990s, leading to a potential \"240\" maximum (three quad-20s), a \"210\" maximum checkout (Q20-Q20-Bull) and \"seven\" dart finishes from a 501 start (five quad-20s, triple-17, bullseye), but was swiftly dropped from professional tournament play after only two years. One make of this board was the Harrows Quadro 240.\n\nAssuming standard scoring, the optimal area to aim for on the dart board in order to maximize the player's score varies significantly based on the players skill. The skilled player should aim for the centre of the T20 and as the player's skill decreases, their aim moves slightly up and to the left of the T20. At σ = 16.4 mm the best place to aim jumps to the T19. As the player's skill decreases further, the best place to aim curls into the centre of the board, stopping a bit lower than and to the left of the bullseye at σ = 100.\n\nWhere σ may refer to the standard deviation for a specific population: List of darts players.\n\nThere are many games that can be played on a dartboard, but the term \"darts\" generally refers to a game in which one player at a time throws three darts per visit to the board. The throwing player must stand so that no portion of his/her feet extends past the leading edge of the oche, but may stand on any other portion and/or lean forward over it if desired.\n\nThe most common objective is to reduce a fixed score, commonly 301 or 501, to zero (\"checking out\"). The final dart must land in either the bullseye or a double segment in order to win. A game of darts is generally contested between two players, who take turns. Each turn consists of throwing three darts. When two teams play, the starting score is sometimes increased to 701 or even 1001; the rules remain the same.\n\nA throw that reduces a player's score below zero, to exactly one, or to zero but not ending with a double is known as \"going bust\", with the player's score being reset to the value prior to starting the turn, and the remainder of the turn being forfeited.\n\nIn some variants (called a \"northern bust\" in London) only the dart that causes the bust is not counted. That is felt by some to be a purer version of the game, as under the normal rules, as explained above, a player left with a difficult finish, e.g. 5 and one dart remaining will often deliberately \"bust\" it in order to get back to the easier finish that they had at the start of their go. For example, a player with 20 at the start of their go could miss the double 10 and get a single, miss the double 5 and get a single, leaving them 5 and only one dart remaining. Their best option is to deliberately bust it to get back onto double 10. Under the \"northern bust\" they would remain on 5.\n\nA darts match is played over a fixed number of games, known as legs. A match may be divided into sets, with each set being contested as over a fixed number of legs.\n\nAlthough playing straight down from 501 is standard in darts, sometimes a double must be hit to begin scoring, known as \"doubling in\", with all darts thrown before hitting a double not being counted. The PDC's World Grand Prix uses this format.\n\nThe minimum number of thrown darts required to complete a leg of 501 is nine. The most common nine dart finish consists of two 180 maximums followed by a 141 checkout (T20-T19-D12), but there are many other possible ways of achieving the feat. Three 167s (T20-T19-Bull) is considered a pure or perfect nine dart finish by some players.\n\nThere are a number of regional variations on the standard rules and scoring systems.\n\n\"Round the clock\" is a variation that involves hitting the numbers in sequence, known as \"around the world\" in Australia and New Zealand. \"Jumpers\" is a faster variation of Round the Clock believed to have originated amongst the British ex-pat community in Asia.\n\n20 to 1 is a Dutch variation of the \"around the world\" darts game that differs significantly. This game uses the standard 20 number dartboard with the triple and double rings. In Dutch it's called \"Van 20 naar 1\". 20 to 1 is typically played between 2, 3, 4 or 5 players, or 2 teams of max 5 players. The goal of 20 to 1 is to be the first player or team to throw all numbers in consecutive order from 20 to 1 and win the game with outer or inner bullseye.\n\n\"Around the world\" is a game whereby each player must hit consecutive numbers on the board in order to proceed to the next round. In a one on one battle the winner is the person to reach the last number or bullseye. In a team competition the winner is the first team to reach the last number or bullseye after the round is complete or each member of each team has thrown that specific round.\n\nAmerican Darts is a regional USA variant of the game (most U.S. dart players play the traditional games described above). This style of dart board is most often found in eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and parts of New York state.\n\nThis is played in exactly the same way as a regular game of darts, but using recurve or compound bows to shoot full length arrows from a distance to hit a 60 cm or 90 cm paper target face that looks like a dartboard. These are commercially produced, but usually only in black & white.\n\nA variant of traditional darts played using a blindfold. Often played by people with visual disabilities. Typically a talking electronic dartboard is used to speak the numbers hit, keep score and announce who is throwing next.\n\nCricket is a widely played darts game involving a race to control and score on numbers between 20 and 15 and the bullseye, by hitting each of these targets for three marks to \"open\" or \"own\" it for scoring. A hit on the target counts as one mark, while hits in the doubles ring of the target count as two marks in one throw, and on the triples ring as three. Once opened in this manner, until the opponent \"closes\" that number with three marks on it of their own, each additional hit by the owner/opener scores points equal to the number of the target (which may also be doubled and tripled, e.g. a triple-20 is worth 60 points). The outer bullseye counts as 25 points, and the inner as 50.\n\nDartball is a darts game based on the sport of baseball. It is played on a diamond shaped board and has similar scoring to baseball.\n\nDart golf is a darts game based on the sport of golf and is regulated by the World Dolf Federation (WDFF). It is played on both special golf dartboards and traditional dartboards. Scoring is similar to golf.\n\nThis is a regional variant still played in some parts of the East End of London. The board has fewer, larger segments, all numbered either 5, 10, 15 or 20. Players play down from 505 rather than 501, and stand the farthest () away from the board of any mainstream variation.\n\n“Halve it” is a darts game popular in the United Kingdom and parts of North America where competitors try to hit previously agreed targets on a standard dart board.\nFailure to do so within a single throw (3 darts) results in the player losing half their accumulated score. Any number of players can take part and the game can vary in length depending on the number of targets selected.\nThe game can be tailored to the skill level of the players by selecting easy or difficult targets.\n\n\"Killer\" is a 'knock-out' game for two or more players (at its best at 4–6 players). Initially each player throws a dart at the board with their non-dominant hand to obtain their 'number'. No two players can have the same number. Once everyone has a number, each player takes it in turn to get their number five times with their three darts (doubles count twice, and triples three times). Once a person has reached 5, they become a 'killer'. This means they can aim for other peoples numbers, taking a point off for each time they hit (doubles x2, triples x3). If a person gets to zero they are out. A killer can aim for anyone's numbers, even another killer's. Players cannot get more than 5 points. The winner is 'the last man standing'.\n\nLawn darts (also called Jarts or yard darts) is a lawn game based on darts. The game play and objective are similar to both horseshoes and darts. The darts are similar to the ancient Roman plumbata.\n\nMoving Target is a darts game for two or more players in which each round, one player serves as the \"setter\" to set the target, and each other player is a \"scorer\" and tries to score points. The role of \"setter\" rotates from player to player each round. The first player to reach 21 points (or any other predetermined number of points) wins the game. In each round, the setter throws two darts to set the target for the round. The target is equal to either the sum or the difference of the two darts thrown by the setter. Doubles and triples do not count for these two darts. A bullseye thrown by the setter counts for 25. For example, if the setter throws a bullseye and a five, the target is either 30 or 20 (25 + 5 = 30 and 25 – 5 = 20). Once a target has been set, the scorer has three darts to equal the target and score points. Each dart is considered individually. Doubles and triples do count for this dart, so there may be multiple ways to hit the target. A bullseye thrown by the scorer counts for either 25 or 0. A scorer can score between 0 and 9 points per round. If the scorer hits a target number with a single, the scorer gets 1 point. If the scorer hits a target number with a double or a single bullseye, the scorer gets 2 points. If the scorer hits the target number with a triple, the scorer gets 3 points. If the scorer hits the target number with a double-bullseye, this is called a ZARTRON! A player who scores a ZARTRON! gets 3 points and skips their next turn as setter, allowing an opportunity to score again right away.\n\nShanghai is a darts game of accuracy. Hitting doubles and triples is paramount to victory. This game is played with at least two players. The standard version is played in 7 rounds. In round one players throw their darts aiming for the 1 section, round 2, the 2 section and so on until round 7. Standard scoring is used, and doubles and triples are counted. Only hits on the wedge for that round are counted. The winner is the person who has the most points at the end of seven rounds (1–7); or who scores a Shanghai, which wins win instantly, a Shanghai being throws that hit a triple, a double and single (in any order) of the number that is in play.\n\nShanghai can also be played for 20 rounds to use all numbers. A Fairer Start for Shanghai: To prevent players from becoming too practiced at shooting for the 1, the number sequence can begin at the number of the dart that lost the throw for the bullseye to determine the starting thrower. For example; Thrower A shoots for the bullseye and hits the 17. Thrower B shoots for the bullseye and hits it. Thrower B then begins the game, starting on the number 17, then 18, 19, 20, 1, 2, 3, etc. through 16 (if no player hits Shanghai).\n\nA reverse form of unscored Cricket, beginning with the bullseye. Once any player has cleared the 17, any players who have not cleared bullseye are eliminated.\n\nObjective is to have the lowest score at the end of the game. Six rounds of darts, the first five are scored at their value (missing the board is 30 points), while the sixth round is one dart that subtracts from the current total.\n\nObjective is to be the first team to reach a score of 150, with only 1-12 counting towards a player's score. Doubles and triples of 1-12 still count, though throws must single in and out. Scoring a bullseye (an ice breaker) will put everyone’s score back to zero. Only three ice breakers can be scored per game.\n\nOf the two professional organisations, the British Darts Organisation (BDO), founded 1973, is the older. Its tournaments were often shown on the BBC in the UK. The BDO is a member of the World Darts Federation (WDF) (founded 1976), along with organizations in some 60 other countries worldwide. The BDO originally organised a number of the more prestigious British tournaments with a few notable exceptions such as the News of the World Championship and the national events run under the auspices of the National Darts Association of Great Britain. However, many sponsors were lost and British TV coverage became much reduced by the early nineties.\n\nIn 1992 a breakaway organisation was formed, initially known as the World Darts Council (WDC) but shortly after known as the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). The PDC tournaments have a considerable following, although the PDC World Championship attracts lower TV viewing figures than that of the BDO due to the BDO World Championship being free to view on the BBC. However, due to the BBC picking up the inaugural Champions League of Darts set to begin on 24 September 2016, they will no longer be broadcasting the BDO World Championship.\n\nThe PDC tournaments often have higher prize money and feature the leading player in the history of the game, 16-time World Champion Phil Taylor. The highly successful BDO player Raymond van Barneveld switched to the PDC and won the PDC World Championship at his first attempt in 2007.\n\nThe American Darts Organization promulgates rules and standards for amateur league darts and sanctions tournaments in the United States. The American Darts Organization began operation January 1, 1976 with 30 charter member clubs and a membership of 7,500 players. Today, the ADO has a membership that averages 250 clubs on a yearly basis representing roughly 50,000 members. l\n\nThe BDO and PDC both organise a World Professional Championship. They are held annually over the Christmas/New Year period, with the PDC championship finishing slightly earlier than the BDO tournament. The BDO World Championship has been running since 1978; the PDC World Championship started in 1994.\n\nBoth organisations hold other professional tournaments. The BDO organise the World Masters and many Open tournaments. They also organise county darts for their 66 county members in the UK including individual and team events.\n\nThe PDC's major tournaments are the World Championship, Premier League, UK Open, World Matchplay, World Grand Prix and the Grand Slam of Darts. All of these are broadcast live on Sky Sports television in the UK. They also hold PDC Pro Tour events and smaller category events around the UK.\n\nTwo Dutch independently organised major tournaments, the International Darts League and the World Darts Trophy introduced a mix of BDO and PDC players in 2006 and 2007. Both organisations allocated rankings to the tournaments, but these two events are now discontinued.\n\nThe WDF World Cup for national teams and a singles tournament has been played biennially since 1977. The WDF also organise the Europe Cup.The PDC has their own world cup competition, the PDC World Cup of Darts.\n\nMultiple World Champions\n\nOne-Time World Champions\n\nBoth the WDF, BDO and PDC each maintain their own rankings lists. These lists are commonly used to determine seedings for various tournaments. The WDF rankings are based on the preceding 12 months performances, the BDO resets all ranking points to zero after the seedings for their world championship have been determined, and the PDC Order of Merit is based on prize money earned over a two-year period.\n\nDarts first appeared on British television in 1962 when Westward Television broadcast the Westward TV Invitational to the south-west of England. 1972 was a big year for darts when ITV started broadcasting the News of the World Championship. Also in 1972 was the start of The Indoor League, which featured a darts tournament, although it was only shown in the Yorkshire Television region in 1972. The Indoor League was shown across Britain on the ITV network from 1973 onwards. Over the next decade darts coverage expanded with many major tournaments appearing on both ITV and BBC through the 1970s and early 1980s to such as extent about 14 tournaments were covered. In 1978, the World Championships started and were covered by the BBC, the BBC innovated with the split screen showing the throwing of the dart and where it hit the board. However the cancellation of ITV's \"World of Sport\" show in 1985 meant they had to cut back on darts coverage but despite this they still showed the MFI World Matchplay and the World Masters until 1988. The BBC also cut back on their coverage after 1988 to such an extent that only one major event was still broadcast on either channel by 1989, the World Championship and this contributed in the split in darts.\n\nWith the creation of the WDC/PDC in 1992/93, darts gradually returned to television with Sky Television covering the new organization's World Championship and World Matchplay events from 1994. Sky's coverage continued to increase throughout the 1990s, with more new events added. The PDC's World Championship, Premier League, UK Open, Grand Slam of Darts, World Matchplay and the World Grand Prix are all televised live on Sky. The BDO held on to the contract with the BBC to continue with the BDO World Championship and this was the only tournament shown on free to air television in the UK between 1994 and 2001 apart from the showdown between PDC Champion Phil Taylor and BDO Champion Raymond van Barneveld in 1999 which was shown on ITV, BBC finally began to expand their darts coverage in 2001 when they added the World Masters to their portfolio. However, it wasn't until 2005 that viewers were able to see every dart thrown live at the World Championship. This was the year that BBC introduced interactive coverage on its BBCi service. BBC continued to cover the BDO tournament exclusively until 2012–2013 when ESPN UK started covering the evening sessions while BBC had afternoon session, after the acquisition of ESPN UK by BT Sport, BT dropped the Darts in 2014 but started covering the evening sessions again in 2015. Setanta Sports also televised some BDO events in 2008–2009 and the inaugural League of Legends. Eurosport covered the BDO Finland Open, the BDO British Internationals, the BDO England Open and the BDO British Open in 2006–2007 but dropped coverage of these tournaments however they then returned to Darts in 2013 covering the Winmau World Masters, they have since expanded their coverage to cover the new BDO major the World Trophy from Blackpool and existing tournaments in the BDO such as the 6 Nations, England Open, Scottish Open and Northern Ireland Open.\n\nITV returned to darts coverage in November 2007, showing the inaugural Grand Slam of Darts — its first major darts tournament coverage in almost twenty years. They continued covering this until 2010 when Sky Sports took over the rights, ITV also showed the European Championship in 2008 and Players Championship since its inception. ITV then increased its coverage in 2013 by signing a deal to cover 4 PDC tournaments per year, the Players Championship, European Championship, UK Open and new tournament the Masters and it was increased to 5 tournaments in 2015 to cover the World Series Finals.\n\nDarts has continued to grow again on television and there now several major tournaments broadcast in the UK, Europe and the rest of the world. Dutch station, Sport One, DSF in Germany and several other TV stations across the globe also broadcast the PDC events. In Europe, Eurosport broadcast the Lakeside World Championships, having signed a three-year contract in 2006.\n\nIn the Netherlands, SBS6 has broadcast the Lakeside (since 1998) and the Dutch Open. They also shown the International Darts League and World Darts Trophy, however they are now defunct. RTL 5 broadcast the Dutch Grand Masters in 2005. Some of these tournaments can also be watched on the internet for free using a live stream, depending on contractual restrictions.\n\nThe PDC has also tried to break into the television market in the United States by introducing the World Series of Darts in 2006. It had a $1 million prize to showcase professional darts in the United States. Unfortunately the programme was not a ratings success and was taken from its peak time broadcast slot on ESPN after just a few weeks. The tournament was replaced with a US Open event in 2007 which was screened in the UK on digital television channel Challenge TV, with Nuts TV showing the 2008 tournament.\n\nIn places where alcoholic beverages are consumed, English law has long permitted betting only on games of skill, as opposed to games of chance, and then only for small stakes. An apocryphal tale relates that in 1908, Jim Garside, the landlord of the Adelphi Inn, Leeds, England was called before the local magistrates to answer the charge that he had allowed betting on a game of chance, darts, on his premises. Garside asked for the assistance of local champion William \"Bigfoot\" Annakin who attended as a witness and demonstrated that he could hit any number on the board nominated by the court. Garside was discharged as the magistrates found darts, indeed, to be a game of skill. More recently, in keeping with darts' strong association with pubs and drinking, matches between friends or pub teams are often played for pints of beer.\n\nIn the professional game, betting is prominent with many of the big bookmaking companies sponsoring events (particularly within the PDC). William Hill, Unibet, BetVictor, Coral and bwin are all title sponsors of major PDC events.\n\nIn the past when Fox Sports broadcast tournaments in the United States, the logos for betting houses such as Ladbrokes were pixelated out and digitally obscured, along with any audible references to them, because of American laws and policies against online gambling; however other US broadcasters usually carry overseas darts tournaments without any edits other than for timing and narrative purposes, and Americans usually cannot visit the sites for betting houses outside of redirection pages.\n\n\n\n"}

Uncommonly, a field goal can be worth other values such as one point in FIBA 3x3 basketball competitions or four points in the BIG3 basketball league. \"Field goal\" is the official terminology used by the National Basketball Association (NBA) in their rule book, in their box scores and statistics, and in referees' rulings. The same term is also the official wording used by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and high school basketball.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar holds the NBA record for field goals made in a career with 15,837. Wilt Chamberlain, one of the most prolific scorers of all time, holds the top four spots for most field goals made in a season and has the two top field goal percentages for a season. One of the greatest field-goal shooters of all time is Michael Jordan, who led the NBA in field goals made ten times. Shaquille O'Neal has the record for most seasons (10) with the best field goal percentage, and Artis Gilmore has the record for highest career field goal percentage (59.9%). Steve Nash was one of the greatest all-around shooters in the history of the NBA, holding the record for 50–40–90 seasons, a mark of all-around shooting for two-point field goals, three-point field goals, and free throws. Nash recorded four of the eleven 50–40–90 seasons in NBA history.\n\nOne type of field goal is called a slam dunk. This occurs when a player jumps near the basket with possession of the ball, throwing the ball down through the basket while airborne. The word \"slam\" is derived onomatopoeically from the sound of the player's hands hitting, grabbing, then releasing the hoop. \n\n"}

IHF is responsible for the organisation of handball's major international tournaments, notably the IHF World Men's Handball Championship, which commenced in 1938, and the IHF World Women's Handball Championship, which commenced in 1957.\n\nIHF was founded in 1946 to oversee international competitions. Headquartered in Basel, its membership now comprises 209 national federations. Each member country must each also be a member of one of the six regional confederations: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and Caribbean, Oceania, and South and Central America. Dr. Hassan Moustafa from Egypt has been President of the IHF since 2000.\n\nThe IHF was founded on July 11, 1946, in Copenhagen (Denmark) by representatives of eight national federations. The founding members were Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland. The first president of IHF was Gösta Björk from Sweden. Björk was replaced in 1950 by Hans Baumann from Switzerland.\nIn 1954, the first IHF Men's World Championship, was conducted under the aegis of the IHF, in Sweden with the participation of six national teams. In 1957, the first IHF World Women's Handball Championship was held in SFR Yugoslavia with the participation of nine national teams. Handball was included in the Olympic Games for the first time under the auspices of IHF in Munich 1972 (men's tournament) and Montreal 1976 (women's tournament).\n\nIHF is headquartered in Basel, and is a federation established under the Law of Switzerland.\nIHF's supreme body is the IHF Congress, an assembly made up of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national handball association has one vote, regardless of its size or handballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once in two years (odd years) after the IHF World Men's Handball Championship. The congress makes decisions relating to IHF's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only the Congress can pass changes to IHF's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the President of IHF, its General Secretary, and the other members of the IHF Council.\nIHF's Council, chaired by the President, is the main decision-making body of the organisation in the intervals of Congress. The Council is composed of 18 people: the President, 5 Vice Presidents, and 12 members. The Council is the body that decides which country will host the World Championship.\nThe President and General Secretary are the main officeholders of IHF, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the General Secretariat. Dr. Hassan Moustafa is the current president, appointed in the year 2000 at the 28th Ordinary IHF Congress. \n\nThe IHF is composed of six continental federations which organize continental championships held every other second year: African Handball Confederation, Asian Handball Federation, European Handball Federation, North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation, Oceania Continent Handball Federation, and South and Central America Handball Confederation. In addition to continental competitions between national teams, the federations arrange international tournaments between club teams.\n\nUntil 2017, there were five continental confederations. On 14 January 2018, the IHF Council divided the Pan-American Confederation into the North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation]] and the South and Central America Handball Confederation. The authority to divide a continental confederation was assigned to the IHF Congress, but the 36th IHF Congress in 2017 authorized the IHF Council to divide the Pan-American Federation.\n\n\n● Sandi Sola resigned during the IHF Council meeting held in Herning (Denmark) on 19 December 2015.

The 1936 games marked basketball's first appearance in the Olympics. The Rules Committee agreed with Goldman (the lone objecting vote was that of basketball's creator Dr. James Naismith), and the game was forever changed. This rule change has been credited with modernizing basketball; speeding up the pace of the game, increasing scoring and making teams with shorter centers more competitive. In 1958, NCAA rules committee chairman Ed Steitz credited Goldman's rule change as the most radical change in the entire evolution of basketball.\n\nGoldman was born in 1910 in Mayesville, South Carolina to Lithuanian immigrants Isaac and Rebecca Goldman. The family moved to Canada when Julius was two. Goldman captained and was the leading scorer for the Windsor Ford V-8's team that won Canada's 1935–36 national championship, qualifying them to represent Canada in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. However, Goldman's U.S. citizenship made him ineligible to play for another country, so he was made an assistant coach and appointed Canada's representative to the Olympic Basketball Rules Committee. The Canadian Basketball team won a silver medal, losing 19-8 to the USA in the muddy gold medal game in a driving rainstorm outdoors.\n\nGoldman was a four sport star (basketball, track, baseball and hockey) at W. D. Lowe High School (at that time Windsor-Walkerville Tech). After high school, he crossed the border to attend Detroit Institute of Technology (Detroit Tech) from 1928-32. He was the national collegiate basketball scoring leader in 1932. He was named the top student athlete and a legendary college player. In total, Goldman's teams amassed 36 championships.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1950, Goldman was a math teacher, athletic director and basketball coach at his \"alma mater\" Detroit Tech. He led the basketball team to a 143-75 record. For 43 years, he officiated basketball and football for the Detroit Catholic Schools Association.\n\nGoldman worked for Smith, Hinchman & Grylls in Detroit as a principal designer of ammunition. An electrical engineer with a Master's degree in business engineering, Goldman designed and developed the 155 mm howitzer anti-tank shell during World War II that allowed the Allied Forces to turn the 1944 tide against Germany's \"invincible\" Tiger tanks. He later worked as an executive with both Federal Engineering and Fisher Body in Detroit, retiring in 1965. He then resumed his teaching career at Oakland Community College in 1970, teaching math until he finally retired for good in 1995 at the age of 85.\n\nGoldman was married to Ann Goldman (née Warsh) (1913–1990).

After buying up adjoining properties, a massive timber retaining wall was erected, and 5000 cubic meters of earth was removed.\n\nHowever, only six first-team games could be played at Kiwitea Street in 1992, due to its poor condition.\n\nFollowing consultations with the Auckland City Council and the New Zealand Turf Culture Institute, a bold plan was implemented to develop an all-weather, sand carpeted pitch at Central – similar to those at Eden Park and the MCG – over a three-year period. \nThe final result saw Kiwitea Street boasting the finest football-playing surface in the country by 1995.\n\nIn addition to these extensive works the club has also undertaken further major developments at the ground including:\n\n1.

The stadium was designed by VMDO Architects and built in 1992 at a cost of $3.4 million, and its naming rights were awarded to the Klöckner Group of Germany for $1.2 million. The Virginia men's soccer team won national championships in the first three years they played at Klöckner, and including the year prior to the stadium's opening the string of national titles was four in a row. They have gone on to win numerous ACC championships while making Klöckner their home, including in 2003 and 2004, adding national championships in 2009 and 2014.\n\nAdditionally, both Virginia lacrosse teams have won national championships while at Klöckner—1999, 2003, 2006, and 2011 for the men, and 1993 and 2004 for the women (who were also national runners-up in 2005 and 2007).\n\nThe fourth team playing at the stadium, women's soccer, participated in the 1991, 2013, and 2014 NCAA Final Fours.\n\nThe largest soccer crowd to see a game at Klöckner Stadium was on September 28, 2007, when 7,906 fans watched an ACC game against Virginia Tech.

The batsman is also \"not out\" while his innings is still in progress.\n\nAt least one batsman is not out at the end of every innings, because once ten batsmen are out, the eleventh has no partner to bat on with so the innings ends. Usually two batsmen finish not out if the batting side declares in first-class cricket, and often at the end of the scheduled number of overs in limited overs cricket. \n\nBatsmen further down the batting order than the not out batsmen do not come out to the crease at all and are noted as \"did not bat\" rather than \"not out\"; by contrast, a batsman who comes to the crease but faces no balls is \"not out\". A batsman who \"retires hurt\" is considered not out; an uninjured batsman who retires (rare) is considered \"retired out\".\n\nIn standard notation a batsman's score is appended with an asterisk to show the not out final status; for example, \"10*\" means '10 not out'.\n\nBatting averages are personal and are calculated as runs divided by dismissals, so a player who often ends the innings not out may get an inflated batting average, on the face of it. Examples of this include MS Dhoni (78 not outs in ODIs), Michael Bevan (67 not outs in ODIs), James Anderson (74 not outs in 189 Test innings), and Bill Johnston topping the batting averages on the 1953 Australian tour of England.\n\nTwo independent counter-factors can mean the simple batting average formula understates performance:\n\nThese counterbalancing elements have been at the heart of the rationale of keeping the existing simple formula in the 21st century among cricket statisticians, who have used this method of collecting batting averages since the 18th century, after some intervening controversy.\n"}

The sport is infrequently called \"hard rackets\", possibly to distinguish it from the related sport of squash (formerly called \"squash rackets\").\n\nHistorians generally assert that rackets began as an 18th-century pastime in London's King's Bench and Fleet debtors prisons. The prisoners modified the game of fives by using tennis rackets to speed up the action. They played against the prison wall, sometimes at a corner to add a sidewall to the game. Rackets then became popular outside the prison, played in alleys behind pubs. It spread to schools, first using school walls, and later with proper four-wall courts being specially constructed for the game. The lithograph at right from the late 1700s shows school boys 'hitting up' outside the Harrow School 'Old School' buildings.\n\nEglinton Castle in Scotland, now largely demolished, had a \"Racket Hall\" which is first shown on the 1860 OS map, but estate records show that it was built shortly after 1839, the first recorded match being in 1846. The floor is of large granite slabs, now hidden by the wooden floor. It is the very first covered racket court and is now the oldest surviving court in the world, as well as being the oldest indoor sports building in Scotland. It has been restored as a racket hall, but used as an exhibition area. Some private clubs also built courts. Along with real tennis and badminton, rackets was used as an inspiration for the game of lawn tennis, invented in 1873 by Walter Clopton Wingfield. A vacant rackets court built into the University of Chicago's Stagg Field served as the location of the first artificial nuclear chain reaction on December 2, 1942. The Stagg Field court is often mistakenly identified as having been a \"squash rackets\" court. Rackets was part of the 1908 Summer Olympics program and was played at the Prince's Club in London.\n\nAfter the second world war rackets saw a drop in popularity resulting in the closure of some courts and others suffering from a lack of maintenance. Dick Bridgeman, an advocate for the sport (and later a British Doubles Champion) established what was then the Dick Bridgeman Tennis and Rackets Foundation. The foundation sought donations to support young professionals thereby ensuring the future of the game. Now known as simply The Tennis and Racquets Foundation, it continues to raise money for young professionals raising the profile of rackets worldwide.\n\n\"The Book of Racquets\" was published by J. R. Atkins in 1872. It was reprinted to commemorate the 1981 World Rackets Challenge Match between W. J. C. Surtees and J. A. N. Prenn as a limited edition of 250 copies.\n\nRackets is played in a enclosed court, with a ceiling at least high. Singles and doubles are played on the same court. The walls and floor of the court are made of smooth stone or concrete and are generally dark in colour to contrast with the white ball. A player uses wooden racket, known as a bat, to hit a 38 mm (1.5 inch) hard white ball weighing 28 grams. As of September 2018, two companies produce rackets bats, Grays of Cambridge (UK) and Gold Leaf Athletics (US). \n\nA good stroke must touch the front wall above a high wooden (often cloth-covered) board before touching the floor. The ball may touch the side walls before reaching the front wall. The player returning a good stroke may play the ball on the volley, or after one bounce on the floor. The play is fast, and potentially dangerous. Lets (replayed points) are common, as the striker should not play the ball if doing so risks hitting another player with it. Matches preferably are observed by a \"marker\", who has the duty to call \"Play\" after each good stroke to denote that the ball is \"up\". Games are to 15 points, unless the game is tied at 13–all or 14–all, in which case the game can be \"set\" to 16 or 18 (in the case of 13–all) or to 15 or 17 (in the case of 14–all) at the option of the player first reaching 13 or 14. Only the server (hand-in) can score—the receiver (hand-out) who wins a rally becomes the server. Return of service can be extremely difficult, and, in North America, only one serve is allowed. Matches are typically best of five games.\n\nThe main shots played are the volley, forehand and the backhand all similar to the way one plays these in squash; because the game of squash rackets (now known as \"squash\") began in the 19th century as an offshoot of rackets, the sports were similar in manner of play and rules. However, the rules and scoring in squash have evolved in the last hundred years or so. Rackets has changed little; the main difference today is that players are now allowed brief rest periods between games. In the past, leaving the court could mean forfeiting the match, so players kept spare rackets, shirts, and shoes in the gutter below the telltale on the front wall.\n\nThe governing bodies are the Tennis and Rackets Association (UK) and the North American Racquets Association.\n\nAs of this date, there are about twenty courts in some of the major public schools and private clubs in the United Kingdom.\n\nAs of this date, the known club courts are as follows. Here, the number of courts appear in parentheses.\n\nClifton College was recently refurbished, to be suitable to host world championships. There are also private clubs that the public may join, and a nomadic club, The Jesters.\n\nAs of this date, there are eight active courts in North America, all at private clubs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rackets World Championships for singles (and doubles) is decided in a challenge format. If the governing bodies accept the challenger's qualifications, he plays the reigning champion in a best of 14 games format (best of seven games on each side of the Atlantic). If each player wins seven games, the total point score is used as a tie breaker. The current singles champion is James Stout. The current doubles champions are amateurs James Stout & Jonathan Larken, who beat World Title holders, Alex Titchener-Barrett and Christian Portz in a two-legged challenge in November 2016. The first leg was played in London's Queen's Club, and was won by the challengers 4 games to 1. The second occurred in The New York Racquet's and Tennis Club, and was also won by the challengers 2 games to 1, reaching a two match aggregate of six games.\n\nThe tournament system for Rackets is being revolutionised by a new World Ranking System, developed by Richard Spender and ex-New York professional, James Beaumont. The scheme is on a year experiment with the Tennis & Rackets Association. The development of the rankings model and the online system has been sponsored by Robinson McColl Architects+Designers, founded by former doubles World Champion, Alister Robinson.\n\nThere are various tournaments that are hosted in North America and the UK.\n\nThese are:\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganised on a challenge basis, the first champion in 1820 was Robert Mackay of England. All championships were closed court, except for an open court series, in 1860.\n\n\n"}

The stadium was previously a venue of the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe Sapporo Dome opened in 2001 with 41,580 seats. This stadium hosted 3 games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador; all three matches were in the first round.\n\nThe Dome hosted the opening ceremonies to the 2007 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships on February 22 and hosted the closing ceremonies of the championships on March 4. It also made history as being the first venue where both indoor and nighttime skiing events took place for the first time on a world championship or Winter Olympic Games level with competitions in the cross country skiing sprints (men's and women's individual, and men's and women's team) and the cross country portion of the 7.5 km sprint event in the nordic combined. In order to generate snow, the stadium used its turf conversion hovering system to facilitate the snow making process for the skiing competitions. The opening ceremony featured Maki Ohguro, a local artist from Sapporo, Japanese drum demonstrations and other performances paying tributes to local customs and traditions. For the championships, seating capacity was reduced to 30,000.\n\nThe Dome was used as a super special stage in Rally Japan in both 2008 and 2010.\n\nIn late 2009, renovations with the possibility of increasing the capacity up to 53,796 were finished. These renovations also included space for more food outlets, an extra video screen, two extra changing rooms (to accommodate preseason matches in the NFL International Series, which have up to 75 players per team) and further media area as part of new office buildings attached to the stadium. As part of these renovations, the surface area of the arena itself was decreased to allow for more seating.\n\nThe Dome switches between two entirely different surfaces: Baseball games are played on an underlying artificial turf field, while football games are held on a grass pitch that slides into and out of the stadium as needed.\n\nConversion from baseball to football begins with the storage of the baseball field's artificial turf. Once finished, a set of lower bowl bleachers rotate from an angled position for baseball to a parallel position. A set of main bowl seats on one end of the dome then retracts, and the football pitch is slid into the stadium. The lower bowl is then rotated 90 degrees. Conversion from football to baseball occurs in reverse. Due to the retraction of seats, the Stadium has a capacity of 40,476 for baseball games.\n\nOther stadiums that feature sliding pitches include the GelreDome in the Netherlands, Veltins-Arena in Germany and State Farm Stadium in the United States; however, unlike these three facilities, the Sapporo Dome has a fixed roof.\n\n\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and held the following matches:\n\nOther domed stadiums in Japan:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8693270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8693270", "title": "Valencian pilota", "text": "Valencian pilota\n\nValencian pilota ( \"Valencian ball\") is a traditional handball sport played in the Valencian Community. Its origins are not known.\n\nRules variations within the generic \"Pilota Valenciana\" category are frequent from area to area but the common trait is that the ball is struck with a bare, or almost bare, hand (only minimal protection is applied in some versions of the sport). The general rule involves two teams made from two up to five players each (the numbers depend on the particular version played). Exceptionally, individual matches are also played (mostly in Escala i corda and Raspall) between the most renowned players.\n\nThe second characteristic is that it is not played against a wall. Instead, similar to modern tennis, two individuals or teams are placed face to face separated either by a line on the ground or a net in all of modern modalities except for the frontó.\nA distinctive trait of Valencian pilota is that the spectators are often seated or standing very close to the court which means that they may be hit by the ball and thus become an (unwilling) part of the game.\n\nThe origins of Valencian pilota are not known with certainty, but it is commonly supposed to have been derived from the medieval Jeu de paume along with several other European handball sports (for example the Basque \"laxoa\", French Longue paume, Frisian handball and Italian Pallone) similar to the actual Valencian llargues variant.\n\n\"Jeu de paume\" is documented at Paris in 1292 since there were 13 ball workshops and many \"tripots\" (courtfields); it was first played with the hands, and the scoring system was very similar to the current Valencian one. There were so many resemblances with the \"Valencian pilota\" sport that, in the 16th century, the humanist Joan Lluís Vives compared both games in his \"Dialogues\" and claimed them to be exactly the same despite some minor differences.\nBeing played by low-class people and high-class nobles, \"Valencian pilota\" was very popular: On June 14, 1391 the Valencia City \"Council\" fruitlessly forbade it to be played on the streets, but this caused the expansion of trinquets (courtfields); there were as many as 13 in that city alone in the 16th century. Later on, nobles abandoned the handball game in favour of '\"'cleaner\"\" sports and so \"pilota\" became the property of the middle and lower classes, which led to the appearance of the first professional players and the rise of gambling and challenge matches.\n\nThe break between indoor and outdoor forms caused many variants to diverge from the original Llargues version. Thus \"Perxa\" evolved into Galotxa, and which in turn gave rise to Escala i corda, while Raspall was still played in both courtfields. It should be noted that \"llargues\" is the only variant that uses the original \"ratlles\" rule, the others using a net to separate two sides on the playing area (as \"galotxa\", and \"escala i corda\"), or with no court division at all (\"raspall\"). Another case is the Frontó variety, which was first documented in the late 19th century, influenced by the popularity of the main Basque pelota variant, which involves players throwing the ball against a wall.\nNowadays, \"Valencian pilota\" is played in the whole Valencian Community, but every area has its preferred variety. Professional players of Escala i corda and Raspall are hired to play at the trinquets or in streets during the towns' festivals. The popularity of this sport is rising again with the building of new cortifields at schools, weekly broadcasts on Valencian public TV, the management of a professional company (ValNet) and the Handball International Championships with countries where these sports with a common origin are played.\n\nThere are two basic versions of the sport depending whether it is played outdoors in a designated street or indoors.\n\n\nWith the basic set of rules for either street or indoor \"pilota\", there are many different variations, some of them are played only locally, but most of them are played in wider areas. The only modalities with professional players are Escala i corda and Raspall.\n\nAnother way to categorize variations is whether they are \"direct\" or \"indirect\". The direct games are those whose players are opposed face-to-face in different sides of the court, which is sometimes divided by a net; the indirect games are those with a wall where both teams throw the ball from a shared court. The traditional variations of \"Pilota Valenciana\" are direct, even though recently some indirect games (\"Frontó\" and \"Frares\") have been introduced based on the Basque Pelota.\n\n\n\n\nThe only Valencian pilota variety played outside the Valencian community is Llargues. Every year a European championship is held by the International Ball game Confederation with players from Valencia, Belgium, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. There is also a world championship with those teams plus Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.\n\nThe Handball International Championships combine local handball variations from all over Europe to create the \"international game\" using the shared traits from all the sports related or derived from the \"jeu de paume\". Valencian professional players do not need much adaptation, since \"Llargues\" is very close to the international rules.\n\nAnother case is the international fronton, another invented variety that takes back the \"indirect style\" to its basics: one wall where the ball must bounce.\n\nFrom the Basque Pelota modalities played in the Basque Country the ones called \"bote luzea\", \"mahi jokoa\" are extinct but, by all accounts they were extremely similar to what has been preserved in Valencian Pilota as Llargues, but using a bigger and heavier ball.\n\nAn example of the compatibility there used to be between Valencian \"Llargues\" and Basque \"a la larga\" modalities was the existence during the 19th century of a sort of early professional side to the sport, with players from elsewhere earning high amounts of money, such as Aragonese Lagasa and Valencian Amigó, who, for example, toured in Navarre during September 1680.\n\nIn October 2006, for the first time, a Navarrese youth team played \"Llargues\" against a Valencian one during the \"Pilota Day\" celebrated in Valencia (in the adult match, the Valencian community team played the Frisian team from the Netherlands). At the moment the only exchanges between both sports are friendly matches of Frontó, which is the main modality for Basques but a mostly irrelevant one for Valencians. In summer, or for special events, exhibition matches are organized, as the \"Open Ciutat de València\", with particular rules (such as the length of the court), and balls of intermediate size and diameter (70 gr.) between the kinds that both regions are accustomed to.\n\nThe Valencian pilota was a demonstration sport in the 1992 Summer Olympics hosted in Barcelona.\n\nEvery version of the game uses its own kind of ball. Each kind is different in weight, size, the way it bounces and other aspects. They are all handmade by specialized crafters.\n\nBetting is inherent to the sport in its professional version and it is arguably the main factor which has kept the game alive, unlike similar games played elsewhere which ended up fading away. This is because betting allows professional players to exist, which creates rivalries and increases the entertaining dimension of the sport for the audience. Spectators of Valencian pilota can bet on one of the two sides, and the trinquets and the \"marxador\" gets a commission from these bets.\n\nThe two teams dress either with red or blue shirts. Bets are made for one color (red or blue) winning, for a certain margin of victory points, or for an expected way to score each particular point.\n\nRemarkably high amounts of money may be bet during relevant games involving famous players. The more famous players become, the more betting is involved and so their personal revenue.\n\n\"Valencian pilota\" players are called \"pilotaris\" or \"pilotaires\". Usually amateur players are only proficient in one variant, but professional players tend to be hired for social events and exhibitions in other variants.

In the 1990s, Disney water parks had pool volleyball entertainment. DLRG- Ortsgruppe Havixbeck, has organized first water volley tournament in 1985, creating by-so water volleyball club. US has on its own developed powerful swimming pool play, creating volley standards. Water Volleyball is played throughout US Universities, such as: San Diego University, California, Iowa State University, Iowa, University of South Florida, St. Petersburg, Lenoir-Rhyne University, N. C., Lindsey Wilson College.\n\nThe sport is known differently as aqua-volei (Brazil), voleibol acuático (Spain), Wasser-Volleyball (Germany), acqua pallavolo (Italy), vodní volejbal (Czech), splash/ pool/water volley (United States).\n\nThe court must be a rectangle a minimum 3 meters in length to a maximum of 6 meters in length. It can be a minimum of 2 meters in width to a maximum of 5 meters in width. The net must run across the width of the court and be centered along the length so that both players have an equal amount of court in which to play. In most pools there is a deep end and a shallow end. If possible try putting the net where both players are in the deep end.\n\nThe server must hit the ball upwards, towards the receiver and it must be within arms length of the receiver when standing still. The serve is not allowed to be a spike and the receiver can not spike of the serve. One team serves for 2 points then the other team serves, and play continues in this fashion. When it is 10 apiece, you start serving 1 serve each. A flip of a coin at the start of the game is used to see who serves first, or else the person in the deep end serves first.\n\nWater volleyball is played between two teams, usually consisting of 1 to 4 players.\n\nOne team is chosen to serve first, whereupon they serve twice, then the team which did not serve first serves twice, and play continues in this fashion. The winner is first team to score eleven points. However, if the score gets to 10 apiece, then the team to score either two points ahead of the other team, or else first to fifteen points, wins the game. There are usually 5 games in a match.\n\nThe first team to reach 11 points wins. If the score reaches 10 apiece, then it is first team to by 2 points or first to 15 points.\n\n\n"}

The result of the match would help to determine which teams progressed to the quarter-finals of the competition. If Somerset lost the match, and Glamorgan won their match, then Somerset, Worcestershire and Glamorgan would all be level on points, and bowling strike rate would be used as a tie-breaker. Brian Rose, Somerset's captain, realised that if he batted first and declared the innings closed after just one over, it would protect Somerset's strike rate advantage and guarantee them qualification. Somerset scored just one run from their over, and Worcestershire then took ten balls to score the two runs they needed to win. The match was completed in 18 minutes, and consisted of only 16 legal deliveries.\n\nAlthough Somerset's declaration was within the laws of the game, Rose was condemned by the press and cricket officials. The \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" claimed that Rose had \"sacrificed all known cricketing principles by deliberately losing the game\". Just over a week after the match was played, the Test and County Cricket Board met for an emergency session and voted to expel Somerset from the competition by a vote of seventeen to one.\n\nComing into the 1979 season, Somerset had never won a major trophy in their 104-year history. The previous season, Somerset came close to winning each of the three English county cricket one-day competitions; they were losing semi-finalists in the Benson & Hedges Cup and losing finalists in the Gillette Cup. In the John Player League, they finished second on run rate; Somerset, Hampshire and Leicestershire were all tied on 48 points, but Hampshire had the superior run rate, and won the competition, a similar fate to that they suffered in the 1976 John Player League, when five teams had tied on points, and Kent won on run rate. The Somerset team, which featured international players such as Viv Richards and Ian Botham, was one of \"the most talked-about and glamorous\" cricket teams at the time, according to Somerset cricket historian David Foot. Worcestershire were not challenging for honours as much as Somerset, though they had finished fourth in the 1978 John Player League, and had won the 1974 County Championship. Cricket was undergoing a period of increasing commercialism; Alex Bannister of the \"Daily Mail\" suggested that \"the game [of cricket] is now about prize money and is more so-called professional\"; the Benson & Hedges Cup offered total prize money of over £27,000, with £6,500 of that being awarded to the winning team. \nEntering the final round of matches, Somerset led the group, having won all three of their matches. They faced Worcestershire, while Glamorgan had to play a side representing the Minor Counties. The Somerset players, led by their captain, Brian Rose, worked out that despite their place at the top of the table, they could still miss out on qualification for the quarter-finals. Aware of their previous problems with run rate in the 1976 and 1978 John Player League tournaments, they knew that if they lost heavily to Worcestershire, and Glamorgan beat the weak Minor Counties side by a large enough margin, all three teams would be level on points, and Worcestershire and Glamorgan could qualify by having superior bowling strike rates. Rule Vii (c) of the Benson and Hedges Cup stated: \"In the event of two or more teams in any zone having an equal number of points, their position shall be based on the faster rate of taking wickets in all zonal league matches (to be calculated by total balls bowled divided by wickets taken).\" After their near misses over the previous years, the Somerset players were determined that they were not going to miss out again; one of the players, Vic Marks, later described how they wanted to \"atone for the acute disappointments of the 1978 season.\"\n\nIn order to avoid suffering a heavy defeat that could eliminate them, Rose worked out that if they batted first and declared within the first seven balls of their batting innings, it would not matter if they lost, as their bowling strike rate could not suffer sufficiently for them to be knocked out. There was no rule against declaring in one-day cricket, but Rose was aware that his plan was controversial. He discussed it with his teammates and there was no significant opposition–Derek Taylor, the wicket-keeper did not like the idea, but was not vociferous in the discussion. Rose sought clarification from Donald Carr, the chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), who administered cricket in England. Carr told Rose that his plan was legal, but against the spirit of the laws, and that he thought there would be repercussions if they went ahead with the plan. Roy Kerslake, the Somerset chairman, was with the team in Worcester and though he had reservations, he told Rose that he would \"support the team whatever their decision\".\n\nThe match was originally scheduled to be played on Wednesday 23 May at Worcestershire's New Road ground in Worcester, but no play was possible due to bad weather, and so the match was moved to the following day. The same thing happened in Watford, where Glamorgan and the Minor Counties were due to be playing. Although it was overcast and slightly wet the next morning, play started on time. Rose won the toss for Somerset, and chose to bat first. The Somerset captain himself opened the batting, alongside Peter Denning. Worcestershire's West Indian bowler, Vanburn Holder, bowled the first over. Holder bowled seven deliveries—six denoted a normal over, but he had to bowl one extra due to a no-ball—all to Rose, who did not play any scoring shots, and declared Somerset's innings complete at the end of the over. Somerset had scored just one run, which they were awarded for the no-ball, and Worcestershire only needed to score two to win. The players left the field for the ten-minute break between innings, and when they returned Glenn Turner and Alan Ormrod were the batsmen. Colin Dredge bowled the first over for Somerset, and Turner scored one run from it. Keith Jennings bowled the second over, and Turner scored another single from the fourth delivery to grant Worcestershire the victory.\n\nPlay lasted for just 18 minutes (of which 10 minutes were the interval between innings) and 16 legal deliveries. There were around 100 spectators at the ground, but many were just arriving, or still travelling to the match. Charles Burnett was supposed to select the man of the match, but in light of the nature of the game, he decided that it would be \"improper\" to make such a selection.\n\n\nUmpires:\n\nKey\n\nThe small crowd in Worcester were angered by the decision, and Worcestershire's secretary Mike Vockins gave all those present a full refund while describing Somerset's declaration as \"an absolute disgrace\". Some Somerset fans had travelled over to watch the game, while Alan Gibson of \"The Times\" (although the paper was on strike at the time) had only just arrived at the railway station when he was told by a porter that he might as well head back as the match had finished. The Somerset team left the ground within 14 minutes of the end of the game. As they were leaving, one spectator banged on Rose's car window and shouted at him, \"You've done a terrible thing for cricket.\"\n\nThe wet weather which had delayed the match continued for most of the week, leaving the newspaper cricket journalists with little else to write about other than the \"Worcester affair\". Some speculated that the Somerset players may have placed bets on Worcestershire winning the match, while John Arlott of \"The Guardian\" was kinder, writing that Rose \"did not infringe them <nowiki>[the rules of the competition]</nowiki>, he exploited them\". His newspaper blamed the action on the TCCB, suggesting that it was the rules that were to blame, rather than the players. In contrast, \"The Daily Telegraph\" complained that Rose was \"plumbing the depths\" with his \"cynical tactics\". In their end of year summary, the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" were disdainful of the declaration, writing that Rose had \"sacrificed all known cricketing principles by deliberately losing the game\". Despite this condemnation, Rose was still named as one of five \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year, primarily for captaining Somerset to their first major honours.\n\nRose defended his actions, claiming that he \"had no alternative\", and that his \"first duty is to Somerset. If anybody wishes to complain, he should do it to the people who make the rules.\" Somerset's president, Colin Atkinson spoke to representatives from Worcestershire the day after the game and offered to play the match again, but his suggestion was rejected. The TCCB chairman, Carr, made a statement after the game that \"Somerset's action is totally contrary to the spirit of the competition, but is not in breach of the rules as they are written\" and announced that an inquiry would be held at season's end. However, due to the strength and volume of complaints, a special meeting of the TCCB was called for 1 June. At that meeting, Somerset were disqualified from the competition by seventeen votes to one. Only the representative from Derbyshire opposed it, with even Somerset voting for the expulsion. Due to Somerset's disqualification, Glamorgan joined Worcestershire in the quarter-finals. As it turned out, had Somerset played the game as normal, they would have qualified, as Glamorgan's match against the Minor Counties ended with no result due to rain, leaving them two points behind Somerset and Worcestershire.\n\nAlthough Atkinson initially gave a public apology, and stated that the declaration was \"wholly indefensible\", he later suggested that he thought Somerset were victims of a kangaroo court, and that the meeting had happened at a point when the topic was still very emotive and people were \"baying for blood\". Kerslake, the chairman, offered to resign, while Rose considered similar, but ultimately both continued in their roles. The Somerset players, who felt like they were being treated like criminals by the press, were concerned about what sort of reception they would get at their next match; a home fixture against Hampshire. They need not have worried; the team were cheered onto the pitch, while Rose was given an individual standing ovation when he batted. A few supporters at the match hung out a banner stating \"It's Brian Rose I do declare!\".\n\nSomerset went on to win the Gillette Cup and John Player League that season, while Worcestershire were eliminated from the Benson & Hedges Cup in the quarter-finals by Surrey. The organising committee of the 1979 Cricket World Cup, which was held in England, met in early June and decided that declarations would not be allowed during the tournament. The laws of cricket were subsequently altered to ban declarations in one-day cricket. Arlott suggested that the strong action taken by the TCCB meant that it was unlikely that captains would seek to exploit any loopholes in the future. David Frith, writing for \"Wisden Cricket Monthly\" was similarly hopeful that the action taken would prevent any further instances of poor sportsmanship. Both of their suppositions were proved wrong, as just under two years later, Trevor Chappell bowled the last delivery of a One Day International match underarm to prevent New Zealand from scoring the six runs they needed for victory. Similar to the declaration, the delivery was within the laws of the game, but was widely condemned for being against the spirit of cricket.\n\nA not dissimilar incident occurred in Welsh club cricket in 2017, when Carew Cricket Club declared their final match of the season on 18 for one. They had worked out that a loss would still result in them winning the league, as long as their opponents, who were second in the league, did not score any batting or bowling bonus points. Carew retained their victory over Pembroke County Cricket Club, and also their league title, however a league disciplinary committee decided to relegate the team, impose a £300 fine, and suspend their captain for the start of the following season.\n\n"}
