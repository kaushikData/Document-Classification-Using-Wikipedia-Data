They currently play in the second level of Chilean football, the Primera B.\n\nThe club was founded on December 23, 1929, as \"Club Deportivo Santa Rosa Lo Barnechea\". Its name was changed to Deportivo Lo Barnechea in 1943. \n\nBarnechea was part of the first season of the Chilean Cuarta División in 1983, where it played until 1988. A second-place finish behind Municipal Las Condes that season saw Barnechea promoted to the Chilean Tercera División.\n\nIn the 2009–10 season the team played the Liguilla de Ascenso, finishing in 3rd place behind Trasandino and Magallanes.\n\nThe next season saw Barnechea win the Third Division, finishing 1st in the Liguilla de Ascenso, above Arturo Fernández Vial, Iberia Los Ángeles and Municipal Mejillones.\n\nIn 2011–12 it played the Chilean Primera División B, finishing in 2nd place with 66 points. It won a place to play the two-legged promotion final against the third-placed Ñublense.

Barnechea won the first leg 3–1 at the Estadio Santa Laura with goals from Ignacio Caroca and Francisco Ibañez adding to an Eduardo Farías own goal. Agustín Vuletich scored for Cobresal.

Their captain and goalkeeper Jorge Manduca scored the decisive penalty in the resulting shoot-out to send Barnechea through to the Chilean Primera División 2014–15 by a 4–3 margin.\n\nOn August 3, 2014, Nicolas Maturana scored Barnechea's first-ever goal in the top flight against Audax Italiano. A week later, Barnechea won their first match in the First Division, with Francisco Ibañez scoring the only goal in a 1–0 win against San Marcos de Arica.\n\nThe club were relegated to Chilean Primera Division B at the end of the 2014–15 season after finishing 18th.\n\nBack to the second category, the team started with a triumph before Deportes Concepción, followed by a tie as a visitor to Deportes Iberia and other local before Ñublense. But already in the fourth date, began to notice the fragility of the game - except the win 5-2 before Deportes La Serena as a visitor at the sixth date - where the results did not accompany and the game nor\nAfter the bad campaign, where the team was 13 dates without win.

{"id": "21048400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21048400", "title": "Bowling", "text": "Bowling\n\nBowling is a sport or leisure activity in which a player rolls or throws a bowling ball towards a target. It is one of the major forms of throwing sports. In pin bowling variations, the target is usually to knock over pins at the end of a lane. A strike is when all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, whereas a spare is when all the pins are knocked over on the second shot. The maximum score is 300, which is achieved by getting 12 strikes in a row. Three consecutive strikes are known as a \"turkey\". Further strings of strikes are referred to as the number with the word \"bagger\", such as \"four-bagger\" for four consecutive strikes. The term \"hambone\" has also been used to describe four consecutive strikes. In target variations, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a mark as possible. The pin version of bowling is often played on a flat wooden, or other synthetic, surface (which can be oiled in different patterns for different techniques). In target bowling, the surface may be grass, gravel or a synthetic surface. The most common types of pin bowling include ten-pin, nine-pin, candlepin, duckpin and five-pin bowling. In target bowling, bowls, skittles, kegel, bocce, carpet bowls, pétanque, and boules, both indoor and outdoor varieties are popular. Today the sport of bowling is played by 100 million people in more than 90 countries worldwide (including 70 million players in the United States), and continues to grow through entertainment media such as video games for home consoles and handheld devices.\n\n\"Bowling\" in the United States and Canada usually refers to ten-pin bowling. In the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries it tends to refer to lawn bowls.\n\nThe earliest known forms of bowling date back to ancient Egypt. Remnants of balls used at the time were found among artifacts in ancient Egypt going back to the Egyptian protodynastic period in 3200 BC. Balls were made using the husks of grains, covered in a material such as leather, and bound with string. Other balls made of porcelain have also been found, indicating that these were rolled along the ground rather than thrown due to their size and weight. Some of these resemble the modern day jack used in target bowl games. Bowling games of different forms are also noted by Herodotus as an invention of the Lydians in Asia Minor.\n\nAbout 2,000 years ago, in the Roman Empire, a similar game evolved between Roman legionaries entailing the tossing of stone objects as close as possible to other stone objects, which eventually evolved into Italian Bocce, or outdoor bowling.\n\nAround 400 AD, bowling began in Germany as a religious ritual to cleanse oneself from sin by rolling a rock into a club (kegel) representing the heathen, resulting in bowlers being called keglers.\n\nIn 1299 the oldest known bowling green for target style bowling to survive to modern times was built. Master's Close (now the Old Bowling Green of the Southampton Bowling Club) in Southampton, England is still in use.\n\nIn 1325 laws were passed in Berlin and Cologne limiting bets on lawn bowling to five shillings.\n\nIn 1366 the first official mention of bowling in England was made, when King Edward III banned it as a distraction to archery practice.\n\nIn the 15th-17th centuries lawn bowling spread from Germany into Austria, Switzerland, and the Low Countries, with playing surfaces\nmade of cinders or baked clay.\n\nIn 1455 lawn bowling lanes in London were first roofed-over, turning bowling into an all-weather game. In Germany, they were called kegelbahns, often attached to taverns and guest houses.\n\nIn 1463 a public feast was held in Frankfurt, Germany, with a venison dinner followed by lawn bowling.\n\nIn 1511 English King Henry VIII was an avid bowler. He banned bowling for the lower classes and imposed a levy for private lanes to limit them to the wealthy. Another English law, passed in 1541 (repealed in 1845), prohibited workers from bowling, except at Christmas, and only in their master's home and in his presence. In 1530 he acquired Whitehall Palace in central London as his new residence, having it extensively rebuilt complete with outdoor bowling lanes, indoor tennis court, jousting tiltyard, and cockfighting pit.\n\nProtestant Reformation founder Martin Luther set the number of pins (which varied from 3 to 17) at nine. He had a bowling lane built next to his home for his children, sometimes rolling a ball himself.\n\nOn 19 July 1588 English Vice-Admiral Sir Francis Drake allegedly was playing bowls at Plymouth Hoe when the arrival of the Spanish Armada was announced, replying \"We have time enough to finish the game and beat the Spaniards too.\"\n\nIn 1609 Dutch East India Company explorer Henry Hudson discovered Hudson Bay, bringing Dutch colonization to New Amsterdam (later New York); Hudson's men brought some form of lawn bowling with them.\n\nIn 1617 English King James I published \"Declaration of Sports\", banning bowling on Sundays but permitting dancing and archery for those first attending an Anglican service, outraging Puritans; it was reissued in 1633 by his successor Charles I, then ordered publicly burned in 1643 by the Puritan Parliament.\n\nIn 1670 Dutchmen liked to bowl at the Old King’s Arms Tavern near modern-day 2nd and Broadway in New York City.\n\nIn 1733 Bowling Green in New York City was built on the site of a Dutch cattle market and parade ground, becoming the city's oldest public park to survive to modern times.\n\nA painting from around 1810 shows British bowlers playing a bowling sport outdoors. It shows a triangular formation of ten pins chronologically before it appeared in the United States.\n\nIn 1819, New York writer Washington Irving made the first mention of ninepin bowling in American literature in his story \"Rip Van Winkle.\n\nOn 1 January 1840, Knickerbocker Alleys in New York City opened, becoming the first indoor bowling alley.\n\nIn 1841, the state of Connecticut banned nine-pin bowling to stop gambling, causing ten-pin bowling to be created to get around the law — some 31 years after the aforementioned British outdoor ten-pin bowling painting was dated.\n\nIn 1846, the oldest surviving bowling lanes in the United States were built as part of Roseland Cottage, the summer estate of Henry Chandler Bowen (1831-1896) in Woodstock, Connecticut. The lanes, now part of Historic New England's Roseland Cottage House Museum contain Gothic Revival architectural elements in keeping with the style of the entire estate.\n\nIn 1848, the Revolutions of 1848 resulted in accelerated German immigration to the U.S., reaching 5 million by 1900, bringing their love of beer and bowling with them; by the late 19th century they made New York City a center of bowling.\n\nIn 1848, the Scottish Bowling Association for lawn bowling was founded in Scotland by 200 clubs; it was dissolved then refounded in 1892.\n\nIn 1864, Glasgow cotton merchant William Wallace Mitchell (1803–84) published \"Manual of Bowls Playing\", which became a standard reference for lawn bowling in Scotland.\n\nIn 1875, the National Bowling Association (NBA) was founded by 27 local clubs in New York City to standardize rules for ten-pin bowling, setting the ball size and the distance between the foul line and the pins, but failing to agree on other rules; it was superseded in 1895 by the American Bowling Congress.\n\nIn 1880, Justin White of Worcester, Massachusetts invented Candlepin Bowling.\n\nIn the 1880s, Brunswick Corporation (founded 1845) of Chicago, Illinois, maker of billiard tables began making bowling balls, pins, and wooden lanes to sell to taverns installing bowling alleys.\n\nOn 9 September 1895, the modern standardized rules for ten-pin bowling were established in New York City by the new American Bowling Congress (ABC) (later the United States Bowling Congress), who changed the scoring system from a maximum 200 points for 20 balls to a maximum 300 points for 10 balls, and set the maximum ball weight at 16 lbs., and pin distance at 12 inches. The first ABC champion (1906-1921) was Jimmy Smith (1885-1948). In 1927 Mrs. Floretta \"Doty\" McCutcheon (1888-1967) defeated Smith in an exhibition match, founding a school that taught 500,000 women how to bowl. In 1993 women were allowed to join the ABC. In 2005 the ABC merged with the Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC) et al. to become the United States Bowling Congress (USBC).\n\nThe ABC initially used bowling balls made of Lignum vitae hardwood from the Caribbean, which were eventually supplanted by the Ebonite rubber bowling ball (1905) and the Brunswick Mineralite rubber ball (1914). In 1980 urethane-shell bowling balls were introduced by Ebonite.\n\nIn the early 1890s, Duckpin bowling was invented in Boston, Massachusetts, spreading to Baltimore, Maryland about 1899.\n\nIn 1903 the English Bowling Association was founded by cricketer W. G. Grace. On 1 January 2008 it merged with the English Women's Bowling Association to become Bowls England.\n\nIn 1903 D. Peifer of Chicago, Illinois invented a handicap method for bowling.\n\nIn 1905 Rubber Duckpin bowling was invented by Willam Wuerthele of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, catching on in Quebec, Canada.\n\nRules for target bowls evolved separately in each of the other countries that adopted the predominantly British game. In 1905 the International Bowling Board was formed; its constitution adopted the laws of the Scottish Bowling Association, with variations allowed at the individual country level.\n\nIn September 1907 the Victorian Ladies' Bowling Association was founded in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, becoming the world's first women's lawn bowling association.\n\nIn 1908, the now-oldest surviving bowling alley for the tenpin sport was opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin - in the basement of the Holler House tavern, containing the oldest sanctioned lanes in the United States.\n\nIn 1909 the first ten-pin bowling alley in Europe was installed in Sweden, but the game failed to catch on in the rest of Europe until after World War II. Meanwhile, ten-pin bowling caught on in Great Britain after hundreds of bowling lanes were installed on U.S. military bases during World War II.\n\nIn 1913 the monthly \"Bowlers Journal\" was founded in Chicago, Illinois, continuing to publish to the present day.\n\nIn late 1916 the Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC) (originally the Woman's National Bowling Association) was founded in\nSaint Louis, Missouri, merging with the United States Bowling Congress in 2005.\n\nIn 1920-1933 Prohibition in the U.S. caused bowling alleys to disassociate from saloons, turning bowling into a family game and encouraging women bowlers.\n\nOn 2 October 1921 the annual Petersen Open Bowling Tournament (a.k.a. The Pete) was first held in Chicago, Ill., becoming bowling's richest tournament of the day. In 1998 it was taken over by AMF.\n\nIn 1926 the International Bowling Association (IBA) was formed by the U.S., Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, and Finland, holding four world championships by 1936.\n\nOn 21 March 1934, the National Bowling Writers Association was founded in Peoria, Illinois by four bowling journalists; in 1953 it changed its name to the Bowling Writers Association of America.\n\nOn August 1939, the National Negro Bowling Association was founded in Detroit, Michigan, dropping Negro from the title in 1944 and opening membership to all races, reaching 30,000 members in 2007.\n\nIn 1947 the Australian Women's Bowling Council was founded, holding the first Australian women's national lawn bowling championship in Sydney in 1949, which was won by Mrs. R. Cranley of Queensland.\n\nOn 18 April 1948 the Professional Women Bowling Writers (PWBW) was founded in Dallas, Texas, admitting men in 1975. On 1 January 2007, it merged with the Bowling Writers Association of America.\n\nAbout 1950 the Golden Age of Ten-Pin Bowling began, in which professional bowlers made salaries rivaling those of baseball, football, and hockey players; it ended in the late 1970s.\n\nIn 1950-1951 the ABC and WIBC opened membership to blacks.\n\nIn 1951 the first ABC Masters tournament was held, becoming one of the four majors in 2000.\n\nIn 1952 the Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs (FIQ) was founded in Hamburg, Germany to coordinate international amateur competition in nine-pin and ten-pin bowling. In 1954 the first FIQ World Bowling Championships were held in Helsinki, Finland. In 1979 the International Olympic Committee recognized it as the official world governing body for bowling. In 2014 it changed its name to World Bowling.\n\nIn 1952 American Machine and Foundry (AMF) of Brooklyn, N.Y. began marketing automatic Pinsetter machines, eliminating the need for pinboys and causing bowling to rocket in popularity, making the 1950s the Decade of the Bowler.\n\nIn 1954 Steve Nagy (1913-1966) became the first person to bowl a perfect 300 game on TV on NBC-TV's \"Championship Bowling\". The PBA later named its sportsmanship award after him.\n\nIn 1958 the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) was founded in Akron, Ohio by Don Carter, Dick Weber, Dick Hoover, Buzz Fazio, Carmen Salvino, Glenn Allison et al., reaching 4,300 members in 14 countries worldwide. In 1975 Earl Anthony became the first PBA member with $100,000 yearly earnings, and the first to reach $1,000,000 total earnings in 1982. In 2000 it was purchased by former executives of Microsoft, who moved the PBA headquarters to Seattle, Washington.\n\nOn 28 November 1960 the first PBA Championship in Memphis, Tennessee was won by Don Carter. In 2002 it was renamed the PBA World Championship, awarding the Earl Anthony Trophy to the winner.\n\nIn 1960 the Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) was founded as the first professional women's bowling association; it went defunct in 2003.\n\nIn 1960 the National Bowling League (NBL) was founded to compete with the PBA, signing name players including Billy Welu and Buzz Fazio, but failing to sign top star Don Carter, after which failure to get a TV contract caused it to fold after its first championship in 1962.\n\nIn 1962 the PBA Tournament of Champions was founded, sponsored in 1965-1993 by Firestone Tire.\n\nIn 1962 the American Wheelchair Bowling Association (AWBA) was founded in Louisville, Kentucky by Richard F.

The hall's nearby building (102 Guillemard Road) was formerly the headquarters of the Singapore Badminton Association (SBA). Both buildings were refurnished in May 2009 as the commercial centre Guillemard Village.\n\nThe current Singapore Badminton Hall is located at 1 Lorong 23 Geylang.\n\nThe original Singapore Badminton Stadium was built in 1952 for the Thomas Cup Tournament. The first tournament was held in the United Kingdom in 1949, and the Malayan team won the championship. As a result, Malaya also won the right to host the next Thomas Cup, that was scheduled for 1952. As there was no suitable indoor sports hall in Malaya then, the Singapore Badminton Association (SBA) decided to build one in Singapore. A fund to build the badminton hall was launched, after a ceremony welcoming the victorious Thomas Cup team at the Victoria Memorial Hall.\n\nIn February 1951, SBA requested from the Singapore Government a plot of land at Guillemard Road to build the badminton stadium. SBA was granted a 99-year lease on the land, effectively from 1 July the same year, and proceeded to construct the sports hall.\n\nThe estimated construction cost for the hall was S$200,000 to S$250,000 but the eventual cost rose to S$800,000. Donations then totalled only S$32,000. Aw Boon Haw, who was a patron of the SBA, gave a loan of S$250,000. Despite this, funds were still short by over S$400,000. Nevertheless, the Badminton Hall Management Committee, headed by Tan Ark Sye, pressed ahead with the construction of the hall. The main contractor was C. H. Tong.\n\nThe Singapore Badminton Stadium was completed in May 1952. However, the SBA did not have sufficient funds to cover the total construction cost. Eventually, the hall was relinquished to the Singapore Sports Council which took over its management in 1978.\n\nAlthough it was completed in May 1952, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was not ready for the 2nd Thomas Cup Tournament that was scheduled on 27–28 May that year. The tournament was held at the Happy World Stadium, where the Malayan Team, which included Wong Peng Soon, Ong Poh Lim and Ismail Marjan, successfully defended their title.\n\nOn 7 June 1952, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was officially opened by the Governor of Singapore, Sir John Fearns Nicoll.\n\nIn 1955, the 3rd Thomas Cup Tournament was held at the Singapore Badminton Hall for the first time. The Malayan Team won its 3rd consecutive title. The 4th Thomas Cup Tournament was also held at the badminton hall in June 1958 but the Indonesian team won this time.\n\nIn June 1959, a crowd of nearly 7,000 workers from 63 trade unions gathered at the Singapore Badminton Stadium to celebrate the advent of the new government after the general election, which was won by the People's Action Party.\n\nOn 1 September 1962, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was the vote counting station for a referendum to Tunku Abdul Rahman's suggestion to merge Singapore, Brunei, Sarawak, Sabah and the Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia. About 71 percent of the electorate voted for the merger proposal. At 11.15am on 3 September, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew speaks of 'the clear and decisive verdict' of the people of Singapore for merger with Malaysia, and 'the awful moment of truth' for the Communists. This speech came immediately after the announcement of the Government's victory over the Barisan Socialis-led call to cast blank votes in the referendum. (See: Singaporean national referendum, 1962)\n\nOn 7 December 1959, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was the venue of Radio Singapore's all-star variety show, \"Puspawarna Singapura\", which was hosted by P. Ramlee.\n\nIn February 1965, the British rock group The Rolling Stones held a one-night performance at the Singapore Badminton Stadium. The crowd was so excited that a wall erected for the concert collapsed.\n\nOn 1 February 1978, the Singapore Sports Council took over the management of the Singapore Badminton Stadium after acquiring a 30-year lease from the Lands Office (now the Singapore Land Authority). The hall was then renovated and renamed as the Singapore Badminton Hall and served as the venue for badminton in the 12th and 17th Southeast Asian Games, hosted by Singapore in 1983 and 1993 respectively\n\nBadminton sports for Singapore (since 1930s)\n\nThis recreational sport was first introduced to Singapore during the time of the British Colony. The game, at the beginning, was essentially played within the circle of the affluent British residents in Singapore. Then in the 1930s, the badminton sport gained its popularity among the local population but mainly the upper social class such as the white collar workforce, the social elites from English speaking background. Students from Chinese education played it as well, but badminton might seem to be less wide-spread for the Chinese-educated who were usually less wealthy as compared to the English-educated. Nonetheless, the sport’s wide acceptance certainly had to do with the ease at which how the preparation of the game was made—a minimum of only two players are needed and the court can be anywhere where the ground is flat and the place without wind\n\nThe increasing passion for the sports had led to many badminton clubs formed among the local players be it professional or amateur. This was when the (SBA) was founded in 1929. The association, supported by patrons such as Tan Chin Tuan (director of the OCBC bank) and Song Ong Siang (an influential figure of the Straits Chinese community), aimed to encourage the game and to select the excellent players from various clubs by organising games among the clubs, so as to produce local athletes to participate in the renowned tournaments among the international community.\n\nAfter World War II, despite of the negative impact on the badminton fever due to the war, local badminton players started to shine in the international stage where the Malayan team won their first championship in the Thomas Cup in 1949.\n\nConstruction of The Singapore Badminton Stadium (1949–1952)\n\nThe winning in 1949 allowed Malaya, particularly the SBA (a sub-association of Malayan Badminton Association, to hold the next Thomas Cup Championship at its place since the winners were from Singapore. However, the sports halls available at that time were considered unsuitable for hosting any international tournaments. The President of SBA at that time, Lim Chuan Geok, thus made call for constructing new badminton hall. The construction cost was planned to be funded through public fundraising.\n\nThe fundraising was later found to be challenging when the government revealed its plan to construct another stadium at the same time, misleading many to think that the new badminton hall was thus replaced. The diminishing amount of public donations together with the increasing cost of construction hindered the progress of the whole project. A sponsor of SBA, Aw Boon Haw (founder of \"Tiger Balm\"), donated a huge sum of money to finance the project. The deficit was ultimately absorbed by the building contractor of the hall, C. H. Tong. However, SBA was rendered in debt by the project.\n\nThe entire construction was finished in 1952. The Stadium was built to accommodate changing rooms, canteens, offices, 4 badminton courts and 5500 seats]. Ironically, the hall dedicated for the Thomas Cup ended up not being used for the incoming Championship because it was thought to be a gamble to let the Malayan team to perform in a hall environment to which they might not become acclimatised yet. The Thomas Cup was held in Happy World Stadium in 1952 instead.\n\n1955\n\nThe hall had its first time hosting the Thomas Cup Championship which was also the third-time tournament. Again, the Malayan team succeeded in defending their champion title.\n\n1958\n\nThe fourth Thomas Cup Championship was, too, held in the Singapore Badminton Stadium, but this time round, the Malayan team was defeated by Indonesian team.\n\n1959-1960\n\nThe year 1959 saw mostly the non-sporting events taking place in the Stadium. The People's Action Party (PAP) had made public speech to celebrate their victory in the general election. The Hall also served to hold entertainment activities such as dramas, dances and even erotic strip dance by the famous local \"Strip Dancing Queen\" Rose Chan. In addition, from 1959 to 1960, \"Puspawarna Singapura\", live recordings of variety shows were held by the Radio Singapore with P. Ramlee (famous Malaysian singer, producer, composer) as the main host. It could be seen that the usage of the sports hall was less strict and exclusive. It might be out of an urge for SBA to increase its source of income and to clear off its debt from the construction.\n\n1962\n\nIn 1962, the Stadium was used as a counting station for the voting over matter of Malaya-Singapore merger where the People’s Action Party had a clear-cut victory. The political significance of the Stadium was clear enough—the hall was a key connection spot between the ruling party and its supporters. On the other hand, during the times of trade union riots, the hall acted as a gathering spot for the unions. Such preference possibly reflected the existence of hall more than just a building but a essential space where political activities or social movements from the working class could be made widely known to the rest of the society.\n\n1965\n\nA British rock band, The Rolling Stones, conducted their one-stop performance at the badminton stadium. The over-excited spectators resulted in the collapse of a wall.\n\n1978\n\nDue to SBA’s inability to pay off the debt from construction, the Stadium as well as the remaining debt was taken over by the Singapore Sports Council. Upon acquiring the stadium, it was refurbished and renamed as the Singapore Badminton Hall. The Hall was assigned to be the one of the event venues for the Southeast Asian Games, which had its 12th (Year 1983) and 17th (Year 1993) games hosted in the Hall.\n\n1983\n\n12th Southeast Asian Game badminton tournament was hosted in the Hall.\n\n1986\n\nA tenant, the Fatty Weng restaurant, was opened at the Singapore Badminton Hall in 1986.\n\n1993\n\n17th Southeast Asian Game badminton tournament was held.\n\n1999\n\nThe Old Singapore Badminton Hall was declared a historical site by the National Heritage Board to acknowledge its historical significance in 2 major events—the 2 times hosting of Thomas Cup Champions and the vote-counting for 1962 Malaya-Singapore Merger Referendum.\n\nStyle\n\nThe Old Singapore Badminton Hall appeared to be heavily influenced by the concrete brutalism though quite a portion of its building was made of metal. The façade at the main entrance has huge sun-breakers as its aesthetic component. The brutalist style here is less prominent as opposed to the other modernist brutalist architectures because most of the Hall’s façades have been covered by coloured paints to lighten the tone of the concrete.\n\nForm\n\nThe form is a resultant geometry of a terraced pitched roof sitting on top of a rectangular mass. The design approach is relatively simple: a rectangular space accommodates all the programs and a roof to covers the upward opening, while the sun-breakers and openings are made on the façades to reduce heat and increase ventilation in the tropical climate. It could be evident that aesthetics was more or less a secondary consideration for the design and the methodology employed was very functionalistic.\n\nRoof\n\nThe roof of the hall, like many others at its time, was made of zinc with metallic truss system supported below, imposing a sense of lightness to the overall outlook of the building and reducing its seemingly bulky existence. However, zinc material is considered a poor thermal mass and might adversely affect the indoor climate. That could be the reason why the did not use the Hall for the 2nd Thomas Cup tournament.\n\nStructural Support\n\nThe weight of the roof was spread out in 2 opposite directions and to the 2 facades, and hence it can be deduced that the main entrance façade and the back facade are the load-bearing walls. In the indoor space, the structural elements are the metal trusses as well as the metal frame pillars located at the 2 sides of the hall, freeing up the space in the center.\n\nNatural Lighting and Ventilation\n\nMost of the openings are positioned at the higher portion of the façades to accommodate natural light and wind into the indoor space without causing strong glares and letting the rains come in. Yet the design ventilation is likely to be ineffective as seemed from the installation of electric fans within the space.\n\nThe Present and The Past (streetscape)\n\nThe front entrance of the Hall used to be an ideal spot for gathering due to the vast open space and less traffic flow in the past. Along with the Hall’s fame for hosting various major sports, political and entertainment events, it probably became highly sorted after when it comes to choosing a place to publicise other events. Moving on to the present day, the road space is no longer humanized due to the amount of traffic flow and the greenery space further reduces the size of open area for the Hall. The Hall is now less monumental than it once was.\n\nOn 1 September 1999, the Singapore Badminton Hall was marked by the National Heritage Board as a historical site. This was in recognition of the two significant historical events that happened at the hall—it held two Thomas Cup tournaments and was the vote counting station for the landmark 1962 referendum. The ceremony was officiated by Abdullah Tarmugi, Minister for Community Development and Sports.\n\nThe building's another tenant, the Fatty Weng restaurant which was opened in 1986, moved to Smith Street in Chinatown in March 2007 when the SBA was not able to commit to a long-term contract.\n\nIn July 2007, the Singapore Badminton Association announced plans to close the Singapore Badminton Hall, after the 30-year lease between the Singapore Sports Council and the Urban Redevelopment Authority ceases on 31 January 2008. The SBA's lease is for the badminton hall and its adjacent building, which houses the association's office and practice courts. Its current annual lease of under S$100,000 would be increased to S$1.164 million if the SBA were to renew it, but the association has no plans to do so. The SBA cited possible sites for its new temporary headquarters at the Singapore Sports School and Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). The SBA will eventually be relocated to the Singapore Sports Hub in Kallang, due for completion in 2011.\n\nWhen the Singapore Badminton Hall closes, the building was returned to the URA. The site of the hall has been zoned for sports and recreation use under URA's Master Plan 2003.\n\nIn January 2008, the SBA headquarters and Singapore Badminton Hall was officially closed down after the land lease contract ended and the Singapore Sports Council decided not to renew it given the rising price of the new lease. The Hall was then returned to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n\nIn May 2009, after a S$2-million refurbishment, the former Singapore Badminton Association building and the former Singapore Badminton Hall started its operation as Guillemard Village under the development by the Turf City Management. The site was re-developed as a centre for food and beverage as well as leisure. The Hall was deliberately refurbished to give retain the essence of the past, hopefully reminding people of the Gay World.\n\nIn November 2009, a 24-hour prawn fishing restaurant known as Geylang Prawn Fishing Restaurant was opened, which occupied half of the former sports hall. In August 2011, The restaurant was closed at the hall upon its lease ended and moved to Punggol East Golf Club.\n\nCurrently as of 2013, the most well-known occupants of the Hall are the Brawn & Brains Cafe and the Onsight Climbing Gym.\n\n\n"}

It describes any delivery that reaches the batsman without bouncing on the pitch first.\n\nA full toss which reaches the batsman above the waist is called a beamer. This is not a valid delivery and will lead to a no-ball penalty, but, like the bouncer, is sometimes used as an intimidation tactic. \n\nOther types of full toss are rarely deliberate, as they can be very easy to hit. A low full toss is frequently the result of an error made while attempting to bowl a yorker, which bounces at the batsman's feet. Occasionally a full toss can surprise a batsman so effectively that he is unable to play it properly, and this can lead to a wicket, but few bowlers rely on this. \n\nThere have been occasions in which a bowler intentionally bowls a full toss to achieve maximum swing into the base of the stumps. This was commonly seen with Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram of Pakistan, though recently Lasith Malinga of Sri Lanka has been bowling low full tosses with his unorthodox round arm action.\n"}

Their team also includes Shust and goalkeeper Misha (whom the brothers nickname as Tolstiy).\n\nMeanwhile Andrei becomes the lover of Anitsa, a young widow who sometime ago came from Belgrade. Anitsa receives famous poets at her home, at one evening it is possible to see Osip Mandelstam, Anna Akhmatova and Vladislav Khodasevich. She is also friends with Alexander Blok, whom Nikolai is also acquainted with.\n\nAfter reading an ad in a newspaper that the British, who work in St. Petersburg, create their own football teams, the brothers also go for try-outs, but they are not taken in. They dream of building their own football field, and decide to purchase an empty piece of land. Shust makes a deal with the Tartar Torgash, who calls a high price (140 rubles) because he has unpaid debts. To collect the right amount the team of Andrei and Nikolai begins to play football for money with local teams.\n\nIn St. Petersburg to Anitsa arrives her sister Vita with a little boy whom she calls her brother (before this, Vita and the boy appear in the scene of the departure of Princip). Vita becomes close to Nikolai and suggests to him to take her as his wife. However when Shust brings Torgash the collected money, Vita and Shust are killed by thugs with whom Torgash is in debt.\n\nAnitsa and Vita's boy leave the city. Nikolai goes to the front. Andrei meets Nina whom he previously courted and marries her. Nikolai arrives from the front when there is famine in Petrograd, which has been renamed. Andrei and Nina live with their child in the apartment of their uncle (who like Nikolai and Andrei's father has already died). Andrei tries to get food at the House of Writers and meets Blok with a pot of potatoes and herring. The brothers go to the wasteland where they wanted to build a field, Nikolai takes out the ball brought from the war, and they begin to play and build new plans.\n\n\n\n \n"}

They are not directly related to the specific actions seen in a specific sport (i.e., strengthening the muscles as they are used in a specific sport and increasing an athlete's functional potential for improved performance). \n\nThe overhead press exercise which is used by runners can illustrate the concept of a general strength exercise. It is a common exercise in which the arms move directly upward overhead. In running, however, the arms move in a forward-backward motion in relation to the trunk. Thus, the overhead press is a good exercise for strengthening the shoulders and arms, but, even though it uses some of the same muscles that are involved in running, it is not directly related to running.\n\nIf an athlete has weak shoulders this exercise can improve strength capabilities which may indirectly help an athlete's arms during a run. This exercise is not, however, as effective as an exercise in which the arm and shoulder movements duplicate the exact action (pathway) seen in running. This is known as a specialized exercise. An example of a specialized exercise for the shoulders is driving the arm from behind the body to in front of the body in the same pathway and in the same range of motion as seen in the running stride.\n\nThe key to improving athletic performance is to perform general exercises to develop a base and to then perform special exercises that duplicate the movements and actions seen in the actual skills execution. In this way, the development of the physical abilities that are specific to any sport will have the greatest impact on maintaining or improving the athlete's ability to perform better.\n\nBecause of the need for skill duplication most exercises are best done with rubber tubing as in the Active Cords set. The cords are especially important for the leg, hip and shoulder actions. The reason for this is that it is very difficult and in some cases impossible, to duplicate the exact movements of the legs, hips and shoulders with dumbbells, barbells or machines. Medicine ball exercises are also used for strength and explosive muscular development.\n"}

The team reached the semi-finals of the 1979,1983, 1987 and 2011 World Cups, and finals in 1992 and 1999, and won the 1992 ICC Cricket World Cup by defeating England in the final with the captaincy of Imran Khan They are one of the most successful T20 sides but faced a big failure in T20 2016 having won the T20 World Cup in 2009 and been runner-up in 2007. And after that they have defeated India by big margin of 180 in the Final of Champions Trophy 2017 at Oval.Pakistan has also been ranked as the Number 1 Test Team twice (summers of 1988 & 2016) and Number 1 across all formats (Test, ODI and T20) at various points. \n\nAfter the independence of Pakistan in 1947, and the establishment of the separate nation state of Pakistan, cricket in the country developed steadily and Pakistan was given Test Match status at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference at Lord's Cricket Ground on 28 July 1952 following recommendation by India, which, being the successor state of the British Raj, did not have to go through such a process.\n\nPakistan's first Test match was played in Delhi in October 1952 as part of a five Test series which India won 2–1. Pakistan made their first tour of England in 1954 and drew the series 1–1 after a memorable victory at The Oval in which fast bowler Fazal Mahmood took 12 wickets. Pakistan's first home Test match was in Dacca in January 1955 against India, after which four more Test matches were played in Bahawalpur, Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi (all five matches in the series were drawn, the first such occurrence in test history).\n\nThe team is considered strong but unpredictable. Traditionally Pakistani cricket has had players of great talent but limited discipline, making them a team which could play inspirational cricket one day and then perform less than ordinarily another day. Over the years, competitions between India and Pakistan have always been emotionally charged and provide for intriguing contests, as talented teams from both sides of the border elevate their game to new levels to produce high-quality cricket. Pakistan's matches against India in the Cricket World Cup have seen packed stadiums and heightened atmospheres no matter where the World Cup has been held.\n\n1986 Australasia Cup, played in Sharjah, is remembered as a famous last-ball victory for Pakistan against arch-rivals India, with Javed Miandad emerging as a national hero.\n\nIndia batted first and set a target of 245 runs, leaving Pakistan with a required run rate of 4.92 runs per over. Javed Miandad came in to bat at number 3, and Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals. Later recalling the match, Miandad stated that his main focus was to lose with dignity. With 31 runs needed in the last three overs, Miandad hit a string of boundaries while batting with his team's lower order, until four runs were required from the last delivery of the match. Miandad received a leg side full toss from Chetan Sharma, which he hit for six over the midwicket boundary.\n\nAfter winning the toss, New Zealand chose to bat first and ended with a total of 262. Pakistan batted conservatively yet lost wickets at regular intervals. With the departure of Imran Khan and Saleem Malik shortly thereafter, Pakistan still required 115 runs at a rate of 7.67 per over with veteran Javed Miandad being the only known batsman remaining at the crease. A young Inzamam-ul-Haq, who had just turned 22 and was not a well-known player at the time, burst onto the international stage with a match-winning 60 off 37 balls. Once Inzamam got out, Pakistan required 36 from 30 balls, which wicketkeeper Moin Khan ended with a towering six over long off, followed by the winning boundary to midwicket. The match is seen as the emergence of Inzamam onto the international stage.\n\nThe 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia & New Zealand marked Pakistan's first World Cup victory. It is remembered for the comeback Pakistan made after losing key players such as Waqar Younis and Saeed Anwar, and being led by an injured captain Imran Khan. Pakistan won only 1 of their first 5 matches including a 1 no-result and were nearly eliminated in the first round of the tournament after being bowled out for 74 against England, until the match was declared as a \"no result\" due to rain. Captain Imran Khan famously told the team to play as \"cornered tigers\", after which Pakistan won five successive matches, including, most famously, the semi-final against hosts New Zealand and the final against England. the most important part of the final was the two important wickets of WASIM AKRAM he got in 44th over which made Pakistan win the WORLD CUP. That was the first time Pakistan won cricket world cup.\n\nPakistan participated in one of the biggest upsets in World Cup History when they were knocked out of the competition in a shock defeat to Ireland, who were playing in their first competition. Pakistan, needing to win to qualify for the next stage after losing to the West Indies in their opening match, wereput into bat by Ireland on a green pitch. They lost wickets regularly and only 4 batsmen crossed double figures. In the end they were bowled out by the resurgent Irish for 132. The Irish went on to win the match, helped by a knock of 72 from Niall O'Brien. This meant that Pakistan had been knocked out during the first round for the second consecutive World Cup.\n\nTragedy struck the team when coach Bob Woolmer died one day later on 18 March 2007 in a hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. Jamaican police spokesman, Karl Angell, reported on 23 March 2007 that, \"Mr Woolmer's death was due to asphyxiation as a result of manual strangulation\", and that, \"Mr Woolmer's death is now being treated by the Jamaica police as a case of murder.\"\n\nSubsequent to his team's defeat and the death of Bob Woolmer, Inzamam-ul-Haq announced his resignation as captain of the team and his retirement from one-day cricket, stating that he would continue to take part in Test cricket but not as captain.\n\nOn 23 March 2007, Pakistan players and officials were questioned by Jamaican police and submitted DNA samples along with fingerprints, as part of the routine enquiries in the investigation into Woolmer's murder. Three days after leaving the West Indies for Pakistan, via London, the Pakistan team were ruled out as suspects. The deputy commissioner of Jamaican police. Mark Shields, the detective in charge of the investigation, announced, \"It's fair to say they are now being treated as witnesses.\" \"I have got no evidence to suggest it was anybody in the squad.\" A memorial service was held in Sacred Heart Church, Lahore, for Bob Woolmer on 1 April 2007. Among the attendees were Pakistan players and dignitaries, including Inzamam-ul-Haq, who was quoted as saying, \"After Woolmer's family, the Pakistan team was the most aggrieved by his death.\" After the World Cup ended, serious doubts were raised about the investigation, with increasing speculation that Woolmer died of natural causes. This has now been accepted as fact, and the case has been closed.\n\nOn 16 July 2007, Geoff Lawson, previously head coach of New South Wales, was appointed coach of the Pakistan for two years, becoming the third foreigner to take on the role. In the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, Pakistan exceeded expectations to reach the final but ended as runners-up, after losing the final to India in a nail-biting finish. On 25 October 2008, Intikhab Alam was named as a national coach of the team by the PCB.\n\nThe Pakistan team has been marred by player disputes and rebellions within the team on various instances. The first such reported instance was in 1981, when ten players including Imran Khan, Asif Iqbal and Majid Khan refused to play under the captaincy of Javed Miandad. \n<br>\nOnce again, in 1992 Miandad was the target of another revolt this time led by Wasim Akram with the support of now retired Imran Khan. This led to Miandad being replaced with Akram.\nLater in 1993, when Wasim Akram was appointed captain of the national team, players including Waqar Younis and Javed Miandad revolted against him and Akram was removed as captain. Akram did regain captaincy again in 1996 and then again in 1998-99.\n\nIn 2009, many senior players revolted against captain Younis Khan when the team was playing in the UAE against New Zealand. Press reports say that a group of eight players led by Shoaib Malik went to the house of former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, where they swore on the Quran to never play under Younis again. Sensing the direction of the wind, Younis left the team for \"rest\" and the captaincy was awarded to Mohammad Yousuf.<br>\nOn the subsequent Australian tour, differences between Yousaf and the other players came to the forefront, causing Yousaf to give the captaincy of the fifth ODI to Shahid Afridi. Shoaib Malik, captain the team in the T20 (after Afridi was suspended due to ball tampering), started a tirade against Yousaf.<br>\nThe above-mentioned revolt lead to an operation cleanup within the Pakistan team, when selectors were asked not to consider Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousaf for any future series.\n\n\"A red box around the year indicates tournaments played within Pakistan\"\n\n\"Known as the \"ICC Knockout\" in 1998 and 2000\"\n\nCricket World Cup (1): 1992\n\nICC World Twenty20 (1): 2009\n\nICC Champions Trophy (1): 2017\n\nICC ASIA CUP (2)\n\n"}

{"id": "3872234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3872234", "title": "Kim Gwang-suk", "text": "Kim Gwang-suk\n\nKim Gwang-suk (alternative transliteration Kim Kwang-suk, ; born 15 February, year unknown; 1976 or 1978 theorized) is a North Korean female gymnast who competed in the 1992 Summer Olympics. She is known for both her exemplary uneven bars work and for her involvement in one of the most prominent age falsification scandals in gymnastics in recent years.\n\nKim competed in several major international senior meets between 1989 and 1993, including the 1989 and 1991 World Championships, the 1990 Asian Games and the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. She was the 1991 World Champion on the uneven bars, winning the event with a perfect 10.0 score and a routine that included an original release move, the Counter-Kim. Her ten would be the very last to ever be awarded in World Championship competition.\n\nDue to her small stature and the fact that the North Korean Gymnastics Federation listed her given age as 15 for three consecutive years, questions arose about Kim's age and eligibility for senior competition. By at least one estimate, she was as young as 11 when she competed at the 1989 World Championships. While her real age was never ascertained, it was discovered that the Federation had submitted inconsistent birth year information for her at least three times at three separate international competitions. As a result of the falsification, the North Korean women's gymnastics team was banned from the 1993 World Championships.\n\nKim was trained by coach Kim Chun-phi and was appearing on the international competitive circuit as early as 1987, when she performed at the Junior Friendship Tournament (Druzhba), winning a bronze medal on the uneven bars. She continued on to other international meets at both the junior and senior levels, including the 1988 Cottbus Cup, part of the World Cup circuit, where she placed a modest 17th in the all-around, and that year's Druzhba meet, where she once again placed third on bars and won an additional bronze with the North Korean team.\n\nThe following year, 1989, Kim participated in the World Championships with the North Korean team. While she finished out of the medals on every event, her innovative uneven bars routine attracted attention. Her set would still be considered exceptionally difficult by modern standards, with intricate combinations of pirouettes and releases. Kim also performed her own original release move, a Tkatchev-front flip toward the high bar. The skill came to be known in the \"Code of Points\" as the Counter-Kim; as of the 2008 \"Code of Points,\" it was classified as a difficult 'F' element. In 1990 Kim won a silver medal on bars and finished 4th on beam at the Asian Games in Beijing.\n\nKim's efforts were finally rewarded at the 1991 World Championships, where she earned the uneven bars gold medal in event finals with a perfect 10.0 score. She was expected to challenge for bars gold at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, however, a step on her dismount kept her in fourth place (tied with two Romanians, Lavinia Miloşovici and Mirela Paşca), just out of the medals. Her final major competition was the 1993 East Asian Games, where she won the uneven bars title. Her score was initially given at 9.912, which kept her in second place behind China's Luo Li (who went on to win the uneven bars world title in 1994). North Korean team officials filed a protest and Kim's score was adjusted to 9.925, giving Kim a tie for the gold with Luo.\n\nWhile the gymnastics community praised Kim's performances, they also questioned her age: Kim was tiny even by gymnastics standards, and many people believed she was too young for senior competition. \n\nAt the 1991 Worlds, television commentators made several remarks about Kim's supposed age of 15. When Kim appeared at the Olympics the following year with missing front teeth, standing 4'4\", weighing 62 pounds and claiming to be 17 years old, the skepticism grew, with several officials and coaches publicly voicing their doubts, to the point where NBC mentioned the controversy in their television broadcasts to American audiences.\n\nKim's coaches claimed that she had lost her teeth in a training mishap several years before the Olympics, and this story was corroborated by photographs from past events, witnesses and video footage of Kim without teeth at the 1991 Worlds. However, there was still no way to explain away the numerous inconsistencies with Kim's age. \n\nIt was eventually discovered that North Korean officials had falsified Kim's birth year at least three occasions, supplying different information at different competitions. The forgeries had been inconsistent at best, as Kim's age was given as 15 for three consecutive years, but at the Barcelona Olympics in July 1992, her age jumped to 17. By at least one estimate, she was no older than 11 or 12 when she competed at the 1989 World Championships, and at the team portion of the 1992 Olympics, Béla Károlyi suggested she may have been as young as 10 at the time: he remarked, \"Her milk teeth are falling out, which is a good indication she's not even 11.\"\n\nThe FIG punished the North Korean gymnastics federation by barring their women's team from competeting at the 1993 World Championships. Kim, however, was permitted to keep the medals she had won in international events, including her 1991 World Championships gold, as she was determined to have no involvement or knowledge in the fraud. \n\nThe same year, her country's government honored her by including her in a series of postage stamps commemorating North Korean world champion athletes.\n\nAs of 2018, Kim's real age has never been conclusively determined, and is left blank in her FIG profile. Birth years given by the North Korean Federation ranged from 1974 to 1976, and late 1990s reports by the Korean News Service claimed that she was 14 years old in both 1989 and 1991. Some people believe Kim was born in 1976, but the more accepted consensus is that her birth year was actually 1978 or even 1979. \n\nThe rationale behind this estimate is that the North Korean Federation was still supplying inconsistent birth dates for Kim in 1991 and 1992: if she had been born in 1976 or 1977, this would not have been necessary, as to be age-eligible to participate in the 1991 Worlds and 1992 Olympics, gymnasts had to be born on or before 31 December 1977.\n\nLittle is known about Kim apart from her competitive history. In April 2008, she briefly appeared in public in Pyongyang as a torchbearer during the North Korean portion of the Olympic torch relay.\n\n\nVault: Yurchenko-full twist\n\nUneven bars: Tkatchev-Counter-Kim (original skill); 1.5 pirouette-straddled Jaeger; double tuck dismount/double layout dismount\n\nBalance beam: Back handspring-layout step out-layout step out; front aerial; back handspring-Chen; double tuck dismount\n\nFloor exercise: Full-twisting double back; double tuck; double twist\n\n"}

It was built in 1963 and closed in 2006.\n\nThe arena was one of the few stops on The Beatles' final American tour. The group played two concerts there on August 19, 1966. The evening performance is infamously known as \"the firecracker concert\", due to a crowd member exploding a firecracker (which some thought was a gunshot) during the show. Prior to the concert, a remote television news feed, with the arena in the background, shows a Ku Klux Klansman promising \"a few surprises\" for the group. This interview was in response to John Lennon's statement that The Beatles had become more popular than Jesus Christ.\n\nElvis Presley also performed at the arena. His first show was on March 16, 1974, which was his first Memphis concert since 1961. The album \"Recorded Live On Stage In Memphis\" was the concert from March 20, 1974. Elvis's last concert at the arena was on July 5, 1976. \"Elvis In Concert 1997 — The 20th Anniversary Concert\" was held at the arena and mark the first concert for the \"Elvis, The Concert\".\n\nEnglish heavy metal band Judas Priest brought out a live DVD in 2006 that was recorded on 12 December 1982 under the name of Live Vengeance '82.\n\nCanadian singer Celine Dion performed a two-night stand at the arena on March 14 and 15, 1997 as part of her Falling Into You Around the World Tour. The shows were filmed and the concert aired on television. It was also released on VHS in November 1998 under the title Live in Memphis.\n\nThe Mid-South Coliseum was also well known in professional wrestling as the home base for the United States Wrestling Association and its predecessors; Jerry Lawler headlined hundreds of shows at the facility. Among many notable events, Lawler faced Terry Funk in an \"empty arena fight\" at the Coliseum in 1981. On April 5, 1982, Lawler piledrove comedian Andy Kaufman twice, ending a match between the two in disqualification. Kaufman was taken away in an ambulance.\n\nThe Mid-South Coliseum served as the home of the original Central Hockey League team, the Memphis Wings (later the Memphis South Stars) from 1964 through 1969. To accommodate hockey, piping was installed beneath the Coliseum's floor surface. The ice was often left intact between games, allowing Memphis residents to partake in public skating.\n\nIn 1992, the Memphis RiverKings of the newly re-formed Central Hockey League brought a successful return of professional hockey to the Mid-South Coliseum, drawing good crowds from 1992–2000. Trying political circumstances prevented much needed updates from being made to the Coliseum, resulting in the RiverKings moving to the new DeSoto Civic Center, now Lander's Center, in Southaven, Mississippi in 2000.\n\nThe Memphis Rogues played the 1979–80 season of NASL indoor soccer at the Coliseum. The Rogues won the Western Division and went all the way to the finals, winning Game 1 of the series, 5–4 at home in front of 9,081 fans before losing Game 2 and the mini-game tie breaker to the Tampa Bay Rowdies at the Bayfront Center.\n\nThe Coliseum was home to the American Basketball Association Memphis franchise. The team was called the Memphis Pros (1971–1972), the Memphis Tams (1972–1974) and the Memphis Sounds (1974–1975). After the New Orleans Buccaneers moved upriver to Memphis in 1971, the Memphis Pros struggled in their first season. The team was then purchased by baseball Oakland A's owner Charlie Finley, who renamed them the Tams and briefly hired legendary Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp as team President. After Finley sold the team, the renamed Sounds also struggled in 1974–75. The franchise left Memphis for Baltimore in 1975, becoming the Baltimore Claws and folded before playing a regular season game.\n\nAs an ABA arena the Coliseum, with the Pros and Sounds, hosted the Indiana Pacers during the 1971 Western Division Semifinals and the Kentucky Colonels during the 1975 Eastern Division Finals; the Pacers went on to win the 1971 ABA Championship and the Colonels went on to win the 1975 ABA Championship.\n\nIt was home to the University of Memphis Tigers basketball team (then known as Memphis State University) before the Pyramid opened in 1991 and the Memphis RiverKings before the DeSoto Civic Center opened in 2000. The Coliseum also hosted five Metro Conference men's basketball tournaments.\n\nThe venue closed at the end of 2006, when Memphis and Shelby County Governments refused the request from the Mid-South Coliseum Board to pay its operating losses, which were projected to be $1 million a year. The coliseum also needed renovations to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Its final event was a concert by The All American Rejects.\n\n"}

Construction began on November 12, 2011 and was completed in 2013; the AstroTurf 3D Extreme surface was completed in 2012, the football team conducted its first practice in the stadium on August 27, 2012. The university initially announced the complex would have 6,000 seats; the number was increased to 10,200 in 2012. The first football game at Moye Complex was on August 31, 2013; Mercer defeated Reinhardt University in front of an overflow crowd of 12,172 spectators.\n\nThe sports complex has the following components: the Homer and Ruth Drake Field House, the William H. Anderson II Family Field, the Marshall and Jane Butler Family Plaza, and the Tony and Nancy Moye Family Football and Lacrosse Complex. Messrs. Drake, Anderson, Butler, and Moye are university trustees and were major donors towards the stadium. \n\nOn February 26, 2015, the stadium portion of the complex was named Five Star Stadium in recognition of a multimillion-dollar financial commitment to Mercer athletics by Five Star Automotive Group, which owns dealerships in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. The president of Five Star Automotive Group, Charlie Cantrell, is also president of the Mercer Athletic Foundation.\n\nThe complex is located adjacent to Mercer's other athletic facilities including Hawkins Arena (basketball and athletic department offices), Claude Smith Field (baseball), and Sikes Field (softball). There is a 101-room Hilton Garden Inn on university-owned land adjacent to the complex. Parking lots are available for visitors-spectators arriving via the Mercer University Drive exit off of Interstate 75. \n\nMercer has an NCAA Division I athletic program and fields teams in eight men's and ten women's sports; all university-sponsored sports compete in the Southern Conference except women's lacrosse and women's sand volleyball, which are not sponsored by the SoCon, and thus compete in the Atlantic Sun Conference.\n\n"}

Many of the professionals also took their assistants with them to gain extra experience, and as the numbers involved in these tours increased, so events in the host countries evolved. The driving force behind the African events was Dai Rees, who would liaise with local sponsors and organisers on behalf of the professionals. By 1975, the size of the Safari Tour had become too much to administer, and so the European Tournament Players' Division (now known as European Tour) took over the representation of the professionals.

She is known for her work with Gucci, L'Oréal, Next, Gap, Tommy Hilfiger, Victoria's Secret, Balmain Paris Hair Couture, and Marks and Spencer. She has been featured in a line-up of the world's most successful black models by renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz.\n\nLenoir was born in Les Ulis, Essonne, France. Her mother comes from the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, and has Malagasy ancestry. Her father is a French retired electrician who later divorced her mother. Her family moved first to Gif-sur-Yvette and then to Palaiseau where she was discovered and started her career in modeling.\nGrowing up in a banlieue district near Paris, which she describes as a \"ghetto\", Lenoir was first spotted at the age of 17 in 1997 when she was approached by a Ford booker in a post office. She signed with L'Oréal in 1997, and has since appeared in their advertisements alongside Laetitia Casta and long-term model and actress Andie MacDowell. She has also worked for Victoria's Secret, Gap, Next, and many others. \n\nLenoir was the face of UK high-street retailer Marks & Spencer, for four years until Christmas 2009 and was seen in various British magazines and billboards alongside fellow models Twiggy and Laura Bailey. Lenoir returned to Marks & Spencer advertising in 2012 where she is seen \"enjoying a selection of quintessentially British pastimes\".\n\nIn 2007, Lenoir featured in the hit film \"Rush Hour 3\" alongside actors Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. In 2009, Lenoir featured in the music video for Usher's single \"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)\".\n\nShe is represented by Models 1.\n\nAfter a relationship with rapper Stomy Bugsy, she lived with international football player Claude Makélélé. They have a son, Kelyan Makélélé (born 2 February 2005). The couple split in early 2009. Despite widespread reports Lenoir was married to Makélélé, she wrote a blog in 2009 clarifying their former relationship, saying: \"I’m not and have never been married. I do have a son. I have a wonderful baby’s father and have a great relationship with him, however, I’ve been single for some time now.\"\n\nOn 9 May 2010, Lenoir was found unconscious, after a suspected suicide attempt in a park near her Paris home, by a man walking his dog. She was rushed to hospital where large quantities of drugs and alcohol were found in her system. She spoke about the suicide attempt in a February 2011 interview with Britain's \"Guardian Weekend\" magazine, admitting she had done \"something really, really stupid\". Some have referred to the incident as a case in a \"series of suicidal tragedies\" ongoing in the fashion industry at the time, along with the suicides of Ambrose Olsen, Daul Kim, Tom Nicon, Hayley Kohle, and Ruslana Korshunova.\n\n\nRush Hour\n\nShe hosted a show on Trace TV for two years.

The Parapan American Games were inaugurated in 1999 for disabled athletes and are held alongside the able-bodied Pan American Games. The Pan American Winter Games, for winter sports, were held only once in 1990. The Pan American Sports Festival was inaugurated in 2014 as a developmental event for the region's athletes.\n\nThere are four regional entities affiliated with Panam Sports, they are:\n\nJust like the International Olympic Committee, Panam Sports has its own flag. In 2017, Panam Sports underwent a complete rebranding of the organization, including changes to its commercial name (now Panam Sports), brand and flag. The modern design emphasizes the unity of Panam Sports' 41 member nations, displaying the entire continent within a seal that features the new commercial name 'Panam Sports' at the top and 'Organization' at the bottom. The Olympic Rings reside below the seal, symbolizing the continental organization's close relationship with the IOC and the Olympic Games. The seal and accompanying rings are centered on the white background of the flag.\n\nThe original flag of PASO-ODEPA contained the four words, \"América\", \"Espírito\", \"Sports\" and \"Fraternité\", each respectively in one of the four official languages of the organization, namely Spanish, Portuguese, English and French. The original flag also displayed a torch along with the Olympic Rings and five circles with the official colors of the Olympics on a white background.

The commission will be made up of seven athletes (five current and two former) with two being reserved for non-Olympic sports.\n\nDespite criticisms that Ulama or Mesoamerican Ballgame and Lacrosse are not included in the program of the Pan American Games, the number of countries practicing the sport is too small for the sport to be added to the program. Currently, there are 13 national federations in the Americas affiliated with the International Lacrosse Federation, with a minimum number of Panam Sports recognition being 14 (Bermuda, Canada, United States, Iroquois, Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico and Haiti). However, the Iroquois nation is not recognized by Panam Sports or the IOC. Thus, there are 12 regional member nations of the FIL, still not enough to include the sport in the Pan Am Games. Lacrosse is recognized by the Global Association of International Sports Federations and by the International Olympic Committee. However, this is not the case with ulama, which inhibits its participation in the Pan American Games. It is a possibility that lacrosse will be included in the program of the Games in the future when more countries join their respective international body.\n\n\n"}

It also stars Bug Hall, Chauncey Leopardi, and Patrick Renna. The film is about the antics of a soccer team consisting of a misfit group of small town kids who are coached by a teacher from England.\n\nTeacher Anna Montgomery (Olivia d'Abo), who is on an exchange program from Surrey, England, is placed into a school in the fictional tiny town of Elma, Texas. She struggles to connect with the children at first, as they believe they are underachievers doomed to dead end lives after receiving the lowest test scores in the state for four years running. She is also shocked to learn that the children think very little of everything. So instead of teaching geography to the inattentive class, Ms. Montgomery breaks the globe in an attempt to introduce the kids to a new game. After some confusion, the children begin to learn the game of soccer. Then at the end of the first session, Ms. Montgomery tells them that they have been entered into a league in Austin, Texas, but their first game was the next day. At this point, the town Sheriff's Deputy Tom Palmer (Steve Guttenberg) becomes co-coach while at the same time becoming enamored of Montgomery.\n\nThe team travels to Austin to play against the Knights, who are the state champions and undefeated for that season. Because none of the kids have learned the rules, they do not know how to play and lose 18–0. They lose heart and do not want to play anymore, until they discover the talent of new classmate Juan Morales (Anthony Esquivel), but have to persuade his mother to let him play. From the beginning, she insists that Juan avoids making bonds with anyone around because of how much it would hurt him if they had to leave soon. The reason they move a lot is because she is trying to keep a low profile to avoid being caught on account of legal citizenship matters. However, after enough begging from the clan, she reluctantly agrees to let Juan join the team. Once Juan joins the team, they go on a remarkable run to the finals, with a record of eight wins, two losses, and one tie, and in the finals they meet the Knights. As the town goes crazy for the final, hometown boy and current Knights coach Jay Huffer (Jay O. Sanders) returns to Elma, and finds in the bar the drunken father of Kate Douglas (Jessica Robertson), one of the players, who tells Huffer (who also just so happens to have a job with the IRS) via bribery that Juan and his mother are illegal immigrants, leading to an investigation that the sheriff forces Deputy Palmer to take up that ultimately forces them to flee frantically to avoid deportation. Though we learn that Juan was born native, while it was his mother who wasn't. Kate is left furious with both her father and Deputy Palmer over the situation, but Montgomery is able to convince her to stay on the team and forgive them.\n\nOn the day of the final, Deputy Palmer goes looking for Juan to help the team in the final, and by halftime the team is down 2–0. With 10 minutes to play, there is an injury to a Knights player, and in this time Juan returns with Deputy Palmer and his mother, and he is substituted into the game immediately. He sets up Elma's first goal, and with the last kick of the match, scores the equalizer himself. The game then goes into a shootout, and after the first three shots are scored by each team, both teams miss their fourth kick. In the final kick, the Knights captain, top scorer in the league and son of the coach, Jay Huffer Jr., steps onto the field. The Big Green goalie Larry Musgrove (Patrick Renna), who suffered from visions of the opposition players becoming \"monsters,\" manages to turn himself into a monster in his own fantasy, in order to psych out the opponent and save the kick. The final kick for the championship was to be taken by the Big Green's smallest, and youngest player, Newt Shaw (Bug Hall). As he runs in to take the kick, he slips but still sails the ball into the bottom left corner, giving the championship to the Big Green. Huffer, having made a bet with Montgomery if his Knights were to lose, kisses the Big Green's goat mascot, much to his disgust.\n\nAt the beginning of the movie, there was a billboard for the town's only other sporting success, in football back in the 1970s, but the end of the movie shows a new billboard, one documenting the success of the Big Green, and also a sticker saying they had the 4th highest test scores in the state.\n\n\nThe movie was shot near and around Austin, Texas in Autumn of 1994. It was released in U.S. theaters on September 29, 1995, taking in $4,688,285 on its opening weekend. The total box office revenue for the movie was $17,725,500.\n\nThe film received a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n"}
{"id": "30404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30404", "title": "Trail riding", "text": "Trail riding\n\nTrail riding is riding outdoors on trails, bridle paths, and forest roads, but not on roads regularly used by motorised traffic. A trail ride can be of any length, including a long distance, multi-day trip. It originated with horse riding, and in North America, the equestrian form is usually called \"trail riding,\" or, less often \"hacking.\" In the UK and Europe, the practice is usually called horse or pony trekking.\n\nThe modern term also encompasses mountain biking, mixed terrain cycle-touring, and the use of motorcycles and other motorized all-terrain vehicles. It may be informal activities of an individual or small group, or larger events organized by a club. Some equestrian trail rides in the USA are directed by professional guides or outfitters, particularly at guest ranches. In some parts of the world, trail riding (of whatever kind) is limited by law to recognized, and sometimes function-specific, trails that are waymarked. In other places, trails may be less maintained and more natural. Trail riding can include other activities, such as camping, hunting, fishing, orienteering and backpacking.\n\nOften, horses under saddle are subject to the same regulations as pedestrians or hikers where those requirements differ from those for cyclists. In most states, horses are classified as livestock and thus restricted from areas such as the right of way of the interstate highway system, though generally permitted to travel along the side of other roadways, especially in rural areas.\n\nRail trails, which are redeveloped disused railways converted into multi-use trails)) often provide invaluable trail riding areas in many parts of the world. A bridle path, also called a bridleway, equestrian trail, horse riding path, bridle road, or horse trail, is a trail or a thoroughfare that is used by people riding on horses, though such trails often now serve a wider range of users, including equestrians, hikers, and cyclists. Such paths are either impassable for motorized vehicles, or vehicles are banned. The laws relating to allowable uses vary from country to country.\n\nIn England and Wales a bridle path now refers to a route which can be legally used by horse riders in addition to walkers, and since 1968, by cyclists. In the US, the term bridle path is used colloquially for trails or paths used primarily for people making day treks on horses, and used primarily on the east coast, whereas out west the equivalent term is simply trail. The United States has few if any formal designations for bridle paths, though horses are generally allowed on most state and federal trails, roads and public routes except where specifically restricted, although rules differ among locations.\n\nThere is some criticism of trail riding when excess or improper use of trails may lead to erosion, the spread of invasive plants, conflict with hikers, or harassment of wildlife. Off-road or trail activity is usually not permitted, as such activity may also raise the risk of soil erosion, spread weeds, and cause other damage. However, many responsible equestrians, mountain bikers, and off-road motorcyclists, especially those who get involved in these sports by joining an organized club, perform hours of trail maintenance every year. Many organizations also sponsor educational events to teach newcomers about safety, responsible land stewardship and how to improve riding techniques.\n\nMany long-distance trails throughout the world have sections suitable for horse riding, some suitable throughout their length, and some have been developed primarily for horse riding. Within the United States National Trail Classification System, equestrian trails include simple day-use bridle paths and others built to accommodate long strings of pack animals on journeys lasting many days. Some trails managed by the U. S. Forest Service and other governmental entities may restrict access of horses, or restrict access during certain times of the year. Access to trails and pathways on private land is generally left to the discretion of the landowner, subject to the general trespass laws of each of the 50 states.\n\nThe term pleasure riding may encompass trail riding. This refers to a form of equestrianism that encompasses many forms of recreational riding for personal enjoyment, without any element of competition. Pleasure riding is called \"hacking\" in United Kingdom, and in parts of the eastern United States and Canada. In other parts of the United States, particularly the American west, the term trail riding is used interchangeably with pleasure riding when on natural trails or public lands. Many horses are suitable for pleasure riding, including grade horses and other animals of ordinary quality and good disposition. Such horses are sometimes called hacks, particularly in those areas where pleasure riding is known as hacking. In recreational trail riding, having fun and enjoying time spent in natures rather than speed and form are the goals.\n\nThere are competitive events that occur on natural trails to test the endurance or trail riding ability of a horse. The level of difficulty varies by distance, trail, and terrain. Endurance riding encompasses races of varying lengths, usually from to , where the first horse to cross the finish line and be deemed \"fit to continue\" by passing a veterinary examination is the winner. Competitive trail riding is another distance competition that differs from endurance races, as the first horse to cross the line does not necessarily win, but rather the competitors are required to finish within a minimum and a maximum time with their horse in the best condition and with additional scoring for horsemanship and care of the animal.\n\nThere are competitive events at horse shows, called trail classes, which test the horse and rider's ability to handle obstacles resembling those commonly found on trails, such as opening and closing gates, crossing logs, and navigating forward, backwards and to the side. There are also judged trail rides, which occur on a natural trail, but assess trail-class-style points based on the ability of the horse and rider to navigate specific natural and man-made obstacles encountered along the trail.\n\nMountain bikes are typically ridden on mountain trails, fire roads, logging roads, and other unpaved trails. These types of terrain commonly include rocks, washouts, ruts, loose sand, loose gravel, roots, and steep slopes. Mountain bikes are built to handle this terrain and the obstacles that are found in it, like logs, vertical drop offs, and small boulders. Mountain bikes, therefore, are more sturdily constructed than regular bicycles, have larger knobby tires, more powerful brakes, and the lower gear ratios needed for steep grades with poor traction.\n\nTrail riding on a mountain bike can be: \n\nOff-road bicycle trails are generally function-specific and most commonly waymarked along their route. They may take the form of single routes or form part of larger complexes, known as trail centres. Off-road trails often incorporate a mix of challenging terrain, singletrack, smooth fireroads, and even paved paths. Trails with an easy or moderate technical complexity are generally deemed cross-country trails, while trails difficult even to experienced riders are more often dubbed all-mountain, freeride, or downhill. Downhilling is particularly popular at ski resorts such as Mammoth Mountain in California, USA or Whistler Blackcomb in British Columbia, Canada, where ski lifts are used to get bikes and riders to the top of the mountain.\n\nLong rides on hiking and mountain paths have some resemblance to cycle touring but the latter usually take place on tarmac. However, mixed terrain cycle-touring, nicknamed \"rough riding\" in Canada and the USA and \"rough stuff\" in Europe, is a form of trail riding, because it involves cycling over a variety of surfaces and topography, on a single route, either using a mountain bike or hybrid bike. A new style of travel called adventure cycle-touring or expedition touring involves exploring remote regions of the world on sturdy bicycles carrying lightweight gear. This type of trail riding is in fact a form of backpacking.\nMount Tamalpais, California, USA, and the surrounding areas in Marin County, California are recognized as the birthplace of mountain biking. In the 1970s, mountain biking pioneers such as Gary Fisher, Otis Guy, Charlie Kelly and Joe Breeze were active. The 2006 film chronicled their story, solidifying Mount Tamalpais' legendary status as a trail riding destination.\n\nThere has been considerable controversy around trail access for mountain bikes, both in terms of environmental impact and the safety of other trail users. As a result, bicycles are generally restricted from narrow, single-track trails, though bicycles are allowed on most fire roads. However, mountain bikers in the United States generally have access to multi-use trails.\nIn England and Wales, bridle paths and some other rights of way, such as byways and 'Roads used as paths' (RUPP), are open to cyclists, but footpaths are not. However, in Scotland there is no legal distinction between footpaths and bridleways, and it is generally accepted that cyclists and horseriders may follow rights of way with suitable surfaces. Rights of way are somewhat limited in Northern Ireland.\n\nThere are long-distance routes throughout Europe, including some through the Swiss Alps that involve crossing high Alpine passes. There are also extensive routes through France that include both steep, rocky, alpine terrain and minor country roads or off-road on a variety of surfaces, from wide forest roads to narrow, muddy woodland tracks.\n\nExtreme trail riding, such as Megavalanche are mountainbike downhill marathon style events combining gravity-assisted sections with those that emphasize the riders' levels of fitness, endurance, and nerve.\n\n"}
