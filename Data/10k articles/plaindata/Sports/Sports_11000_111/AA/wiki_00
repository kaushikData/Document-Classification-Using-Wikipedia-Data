It opened in 1907 and was home to the Syracuse University Orangemen football team prior to the Carrier Dome opening in 1980. It was the third concrete football stadium built in the United States.\n\nThe stadium was named for John D. Archbold, who donated $600,000 for the project. He was also responsible for funding towards the building of Archbold Gymnasium, located just to the east overlooking the stadium.\n\nThe stadium was occasionally used to stage Syracuse Stars minor league baseball games, such as in 1920 while the Stars were awaiting the completion of Star Park.\n\nThe 800' x 475' stadium was oval-shaped, with a track (originally dirt) and a natural grass football field. The west end zone, the stadium's main entrance, was marked by a grand castle-like façade with turrets framing the gateway arch. There was originally a wooden roof over the central section of the south grandstands for the reserved seating.\n\nIn the 1950s, the stadium was expanded to the north and south, bringing the capacity up to 40,000. However, by the 1970s, stricter fire codes forced a reduction in capacity to 26,000.\n\nThis proved to be the stadium's undoing. By the mid-1970s, Syracuse faced the prospect of being demoted to Division I-AA unless it got a more modern stadium, and quickly. It was closed following the 1978 season, to be razed for the building of the Carrier Dome, which occupies Archbold's former footprint.\n\nIn the final game at Archbold Stadium, on November 11, 1978, the Orangemen defeated nationally ranked Navy, 20-17.\n\nDuring its history, Syracuse compiled a 265-112-20 record at Archbold.\n\n"}

It is an equivalent triathlon consisting of a swim of 3.8 km, a 186 km cycle ride and running a marathon (42.2 km), but is not affiliated with the World Triathlon Corporation which owns the brand Ironman, so is not promoted as such. The French newspaper \"Le Dauphiné libéré\" described it in 2012 as the hardest triathlon in the world.\nThe men's record time for the event is 9 h 34 m 10 s by the Frenchman Hervé Faure on August 15, 2011 and the women's record is held by Tine Deckers from Belgium (Marmotta Alpin Triatlon Tribe) at 10 h 51 m 14 s on 15 August 2017. The men's record number of victories in this event is held by Frenchman Yves Cordier with five wins, and women's record by Briton Bella Bayliss Commerford with 3 victories.\n\nThe Embrunman is the culmination of a multi day series of events dedicated to the sport of triathlon with an Olympic distance triathlon (1.5 km swim, 43.5 km bike, 10 km run) and events reserved for youth and beginners.\n\nThe first event was held on the 19 August 1984, but was only a hint of what it would become. It had a 750 m swim, 30 km bike and 10 km race walk. However, the first bike ride included the steep climb up the Cote de Chalvet (indeed the competitors had to tackle it twice) and which still features today at the end of the bike stage - triathletes today still call it \"The Beast\"\n\nIn 1985, the event was given the organisation of the standard distance triathlon championship of France. The route was adapted by lengthening the distance to 1,500 m swim, 70 km bike and 21 km run on a difficult circuit. 280 triathletes participated in the event, backed by 200 volunteers and 20,000 supporters.\n\nIn 1986 the Embrun triathlon became a long distance event with a 4 km swim, 131.5 km bike and 42.2 km run. The organisers claimed at the time that among all categories of triathlon it was the most difficult in the world. In 1987, the distances were increased to 5 km swimming, 180 km cycling and 42 2 km of running. A larger climb was introduced of 2600 m on the bike course and 400 m in the marathon. The event's popularity increased with 420 competitors, 480 volunteers and a large audience attending the event. In 1989, the swimming distance of long-distance triathlon was reduced to 3800 m, to meet the specifications of the French Triathlon Federation (FFTRI). In 1990, the route was changed for the last time with the introduction, in the bike portion, of the ascent of the Col d'Izoard. This new route of 186 km in one loop is characterized by increased difficulty: 3600 m of climbing.\n\nIn 2008, despite the competition of the Olympic Games in Beijing, the event see a record of number of participates with 1260 registered on the long route and 600 on the short. Despite awful weather the race is held, although there are over 110 dropouts during the descent of the Izoard. In 2010, the event supports the twinning of the town of Embrun with the Thai island of Ko Samui with the creation of a long-distance triathlon on the island. The planned first event in 2011 was canceled due to natural disasters, but an event took place on 22 April 2012.\n\nIn 1988, in addition to the long-distance triathlon, an Olympic distance triathlon (triathlon M) was started, with 1.5 km swim, 43.5 km bike, and 10 km run. 520 competitors, 600 volunteers and 40,000 spectators participate in this event. In 1991, the Embrun short distance triathlon became a stage of the World Cup triathlon , a competition with 11 stages and held across 5 continents. For this event, the bike course was totally changed, with greater technical challenge and a vertical climb of 1,200 m located mainly on the first part of the course. 1,260 triathletes participated in the various formats as well as 1,000 volunteers and nearly 100,000 spectators. As part of its tenth event in 1993, Embrun hosts a stage of the World Cup triathlon for the third consecutive time. The attendance increased, to a record with 1,500 triathletes involved in various formats, 1300 volunteers, and over 100,000 spectators. It was not until 1997 that the short distance triathlon Embrun was a stage of the World Cup triathlon again, and for the last time. To date, with these 4 appearances, Embrum is the French triathlon which has most often hosted a stage of the World Cup circuit.\n\nThe 30th staging of the Embrunman in 2013 saw several events spread over five days of racing:\n\n3500 triathletes, amateurs or professionals, juniors and veterans participated in these competitions, including 1000 registered on the short-distance triathlon and 1500 inscribed on the long distance triathlon.\n\n\n"}

As a fielder in this instance typically cannot respond to the path of the ball quickly enough, players try to avoid encounters with in-between hops.

Unveiled on June 15, 2015, during its E3 press conference, it was released in October 2015 for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii, and Wii U. A sequel, \"Just Dance 2017\", was released on October 25, 2016.\n\n\"2016\" notably placed an emphasis on the use of a smartphone mobile app for motion detection, and introduced a subscription-based service which offers streaming access to a back catalogue of songs from previous entries in the franchise, as well as additional content that is exclusive to the service.\n\nAs with previous installments, players select a song, and then follow the motions of on-screen dancer(s) and their choreographed routine. Players are judged on a ranking scale for the accuracy of each of their moves in comparison to that of the on-screen dancer. The game supports the use of each console's motion controller accessories (Kinect on Xbox 360 and One, PlayStation Camera on PS4, PlayStation Move on PS3 and PS4, and Wii Remotes on Wii and Wii U); alternatively, players can utilize a smartphone app for motion tracking.\n\nStandard gameplay has been re-organized under the banner of \"Dance Party\" mode—encompassing competitive and co-operative multiplayer modes, and the ability to send recordings of performances alongside challenges to other players. In the \"Dance Quests\" mode, players compete against a computer opponent across three randomly selected songs. Versions for eighth-generation consoles also include \"Showtime\", which allows players to record short lip sync music videos to songs with themed visual effects.\n\nUbisoft ended online services for the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360 versions of the game on November 19, 2018.\n\nThe following songs appear on \"Just Dance 2016\":\n\nVersions of the game on eighth-generation consoles support \"Just Dance Unlimited\", which offers subscription-based access to a streaming library of songs from previous \"Just Dance\" games, and new songs that are exclusive to the service. Ubisoft stated that the service would offer at least 150 songs on-launch. A three-month subscription to \"Just Dance Unlimited\" is included as part of a higher-priced version of \"Just Dance 2016\" known as the \"Gold Edition\".\n\nSongs exclusive to this service include:\nSteve Hannley of \"Hardcore Gamer\" criticised \"Just Dance 2016\" for its lack of differentiation from previous versions, especially for a franchise described as having reached \"\"Guitar Hero\" levels of saturation\". Although the Dance Quest mode was partially praised for being a new feature at all, it was declared redundant to manually picking three songs to play in a row, and all of the new modes in 2016 were panned for being \"glorified ways to play the game in exactly the same way\". The soundtrack was considered to be worse than that of \"Just Dance 2015\" (which he had previously described as having the worst in series history), citing \"terrible\" songs, lacking \"underground\" electronic dance music, and containing too many older songs (noting that only 8 of the 44 on-disc songs were released within the year). The \"Just Dance Now\" service was speculated as being the potential future of the franchise, noting that \"at $39.99 a year (or the insane $6.99 a month), it's priced just under the cost of the game at retail and considering the gameplay hasn't changed the past three years, it makes sense to simply phase this in as the complete replacement of annual releases.\" In conclusion, Hannley gave \"Just Dance 2016\" a 2.5 out of 5, concluding that \"while the core gameplay remains fun despite some questionable choreography, the overall package reeks of complete and utter apathy. Basic Kinect features have been stripped, there's an unnecessary focus on smartphone use and only eight licensed songs of the over forty included in total are from this year, which is a huge issue considering that the series has devolved into a glorified track pack.\"\n"}

It was built in 1969 and is named after the original constructors and brothers Vlado (also known as Lado) and Janez Gorišek. With a total of 28 world records set it is the world leading ski jump hill in this statistic. The world's steepest zip-line with average incline of 38.33% (20.9°) and maximum incline of 58.7% (30.5°) incline opened at the hill on 19 September 2015.\n\nYugoslavian ski jumper Miro Oman made the premiere test jump of on 6 March 1969. The first ever FIS Ski Flying World Championships were organized on this hill in 1972. After Matti Nykänen set a world record jump of at the SFWC 1985, a new rule was instituted by the FIS that no points for jumps over this distance would be awarded in order to prevent world record hunting. On 17 March 1994 Andreas Goldberger touched the snow with his hand at for the first ever albeit disqualified over two hundred metre jump. Just a few minutes later Toni Nieminen landed on his feet at and officially became the first man in history to jump over two hundred metres. In addition, the first ever jumps over 160 m, 170 m, 180 m, 190 m, 200 m, 210 m, 220 m and 230 m were recorded at the hill. The hill will host the FIS Ski Flying World Championships in 2020.\n\nThe hill is also known for annually hosting Red Bull 400 world series event, the stepeest 400 metres uphill run in the world, with over 1,000 competitors from around the globe.\n\nVelikanka bratov Gorišek (original name) was planned, constructed and developed by Slovenian constructors, engineers and brothers, Vlado and Janez Gorišek. At the time, a lead engineer of Planica was a Bloudek's successor Stano Pelan, who proposed to enlarge Bloudkova velikanka; however, they decided for a new hill on another location instead.\n\nAt that time, Janez Gorišek was working as an engineer in Libya, where he prepared a plan and profile for a new hill. Construction started in summer of 1967 and was mainly completed in late 1968. During the construction, Janez was still working in Africa, so his older brother Vlado was fully in charge of the construction site. Original construction point was at K153, with inrun 145 metres long and height difference between take-off table and bottom of the hill 127 metres.\n\nOn 6 March 1969, the hill was tested for the first time and Miro Oman from Yugoslavia was selected to be the first man to jump. He jumped 135 metres from the second gate and set the first hill record. \nThe hill was officially opened and hosted a three-day competition called Planica Ski Flying Week from 21 to 23 March 1969. There were 60 competitors from 15 countries with Jiří Raška winning the competition. A total of 90,000 people has gathered in the three days of competition. The world record was improved five times and finally stopped at , set by Manfred Wolf from East Germany.\n\nIn 1972, the hill hosted the first ever FIS Ski Flying World Championships, where the Swiss ski jumper Walter Steiner became the first ski flying world champion.\n\nIn 1984, in the honour of Planica's 50th anniversary, organizing committee decided to modernize the hill. First big renovation works were done in summer and fall of 1984. Soldiers from the Yugoslav Army, volunteers and different working organizations helped at the construction site under the command of Gorišek brothers. 1,500 cubic metres of material was dug out and filled into the landing zone. They also dug out 300 cubic metres of material from inrun. Old wooden inrun tower was replaced with steel and take-off table was pushed back for five metres.\n\nDuring the 1986–87 season, two World Cup ski flying individual events were organized on the hill for the first time. Polish ski jumper Piotr Fijas set the last parallel style world record on the first day of competition when he jumped . However, this record was only recognized seven years later at FIS congress in Rio de Janeiro when they cancelled the \"191 metres\" rule.\n\nAt the first round of the training on 17 March 1994, Austrian ski jumper Andreas Goldberger landed at , making the first ever jump over 200 metres; however, he touched the snow with his hands, and the jump was counted as invalid. Just a few minutes later, Finnish ski jumper Toni Nieminen landed on his feet at and officially became the first man in history who jumped over 200 metres.\n\nIn the 1999–2000 season, ski flying team event was organized at the hill for the first time in history. Two world records were set by Austrian ski jumpers Thomas Hörl with and Andreas Goldberger with . Germany became the first ever team ski flying winner.\n\nIn 2010, Planica got new chairlift, judge tower renovated, landing zone widened, profile adjusted, and take-off angle lowered to keep jumpers closer to the ground. All this was needed to fulfill international FIS standards.\n\nIn 2015, the hill was completely renovated and opened after one-year break. A new profile was drawn by Janez Gorišek with the help of his son Sebastjan Gorišek, who is also a constructor. The hill's new construction point was at K200 and the hill size at HS 225. The take-off table was moved five metres higher and pushed back for twelve metres compared to the old one.\n\nIn 2017, the hill size was changed from HS225 to HS240.\n\nSince 1969, a total of 28 official world records has been set at the hill.

It is the 8th Disney animated feature film.\n\nDuring the Second World War, much of Walt Disney's staff was drafted into the army, and those that remained were called upon by the U.S. government to make training and propaganda films. As a result, the studio was littered with unfinished story ideas. In order to keep the feature film division alive during this difficult time, the studio released six package films including this one, made up of various unrelated segments set to music. This is the third package film, following \"Saludos Amigos\" and \"The Three Caballeros\". The film was entered into the 1946 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThis particular film has ten such segments.\n\nThe popular radio vocal group; The King's Men sings the story of a Hatfields and McCoys-style feud in the mountains broken up when two young people from each side inadvertently fall in love. This segment was later cut from the film's US video release due to comic gunplay, although the film's UK and Japanese video releases has the segment intact and uncensored.\n\nThis segment featured animation originally intended for \"Fantasia\" using the Claude Debussy musical composition \"Clair de Lune\" from Suite bergamasque. It featured two egrets flying through the Everglades on a moonlit night. However, by the time \"Make Mine Music\" was released \"Clair de Lune\" was replaced by the new song \"Blue Bayou\", performed by the Ken Darby Singers. However, the original version of the segment still survives.\n\nThis segment was one of two sections in which Benny Goodman and his Orchestra contributed. Their music played over visuals that were drawn by a pencil as the action occurred. The scene portrayed teens of the 1940s being swept away by popular music. This segment features some mild female nudity that was edited out in both the US and UK DVD releases, although the film's Japanese Laserdisc and VHD releases has the segment features some mild female nudity intact and uncensored.\n\nThis segment was a ballad of lost love, sung by Andy Russell.\n\nThis segment featured Jerry Colonna, reciting the poem also titled \"Casey at the Bat\" by Ernest Thayer, about the arrogant ballplayer whose cockiness was his undoing. A few moments are exaggerated or altered and music is added.\n\nThis segment featured two rotoscoped live-action ballet dancers, David Lichine and Tania Riabouchinskaya, moving in silhouette with animated backgrounds and characters. Dinah Shore sang the title song.\n\nThis segment was an animated dramatization of the 1936 musical composition by Sergei Prokofiev, with narration by actor Sterling Holloway. A Russian boy named Peter sets off into the forest to hunt the wolf with his animal friends: a bird named Sascha, a duck named Sonia, and a cat named Ivan. Just like in Prokofiev's piece, each character is represented with a specific musical accompaniment: Peter by the String Quartet, Sascha by the Flute, Sonia by the Oboe, Ivan by the Clarinet, Grandpa by the Bassoon, the shooting of the Hunters' guns by the Kettledrums, and the evil Wolf primarily by horns and cymbals.\n\nThis segment again featured Benny Goodman and The Goodman Quartet as six anthropomorphized instruments (Piano, Bass, Snare and bass Drums, Cymbal and Clarinet) who paraded through a musical playground.\n\nThis segment told the romantic story of two hats who fell in love in a department store window. When Alice was sold, Johnnie devoted himself to finding her again. They eventually, by pure chance, meet up again and live happily ever after together, side by side. The Andrews Sisters provided the vocals. Like the other segments, it was later released theatrically. It was released as such on May 21, 1954.\n\nThe final segment, the finale of the movie, is a bittersweet story about a sperm whale (named Willie) with incredible musical talent and his dreams of singing Metropolitan Opera. A rumor is spread throughout the city about an operatic whale, but is seemingly disproven, therefore the short-sighted impresario Tetti-Tatti believes that the whale has swallowed an opera singer and sets out to \"rescue\" his non-existent quarry, the newspapers announcing that he was going to sea. Whitey, Willie's seagull friend, excitedly brings Willie the newspaper, all of his friends believing that this is his big chance, so he goes out to meet the boat and sing for Tetti-Tatti. He finds them, and upon hearing Willie sing, Tetti-Tatti comes to believe that Willie has swallowed not one, but three singers (due to his having three individual voice ranges), and chases him with a harpoon on a boat with three crewmen. Upon hearing the whale sing, the crewmen try to stop Tetti-Tatti from killing the whale, as they want to continue listening to him sing, even to the point of sitting on Tetti-Tatti. A montage then follows of what would be Willie's future career in performing opera on the stage of the Met, with Tetti-Tatti shown to have finally been convinced otherwise. In the end, reality strikes when Tetti-Tatti succeeds in harpooning and killing Willie, but the narrator then explains that Willie's voice will sing on in heaven.\n\nNelson Eddy narrated and performed all the voices in this segment. As Willie the Whale, Eddy sang all three male voices in the first part of the Sextet from Donizetti's opera, Lucia di Lammermoor. Just as the Curtains close, the film ends.\n\n\"Make Mine Music\" was initially released in theaters in 1946. Like many other package features of the 1940s, it was never given a wide theatrical reissue. Instead, its distinct segments were separated and released as separate short films or used as segments in Disney television programmes.\n\nThe film returned rentals to RKO by 1951 of $3,275,000 with $2,085,000 being generated in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\"Make Mine Music\" was originally released on Laserdisc and VHD in Japan on October 21, 1985. It was released on VHS and DVD in the US on June 6, 2000 under the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection line. This release was edited to remove \"The Martins and the Coys\", because it contained comic gunplay not suitable for children. It also removed some mild female nudity in the \"All the Cats Join In\" segment. The Japanese Laserdisc includes none of the edits made to the VHS/DVD versions. A partially uncensored version of the film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2013, having been previously unavailable until that point. While it restores the entire \"The Martins and the Coys\" segment it does not restore the edits in \"All the Cats Join In\". Since Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International re-acquired Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment from Walt Disney Studios on March 14, 2018, the entire \"The Martins and the Coys\" segment and the \"All the Cats Join In\" segment features some mild female nudity were uncensored.\n\nOutside of North America, \"Make Mine Music\" has been largely unavailable on DVD and VHS. It has, however, been available in Scandinavia on both VHS (1983) and DVD (2006) and since 2013 on DVD in the UK. This and \"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\" are the only two major Disney animated films never to see a release on Region 4 DVD in Australia.\n\n\n"}

Nihon is a member of the Kantoh Collegiate American Football Association. Nihon Phoenix football has been a powerhouse in Japan's college football along with the Kwansei Gakuin University Fighters for four decades.\n\nNihon won the Japanese collegiate championships for 17 times including 5 in a row when Mikio Shinokake was the team's head coach. Shinokake adopted the shotgun formation as the team's basic offensive formation. He often had played the team's best athlete as a quarterback in the formation, and the qb played the dual role of qb and tailback. The strategy had worked very well because the size and the power of Japanese defenders had not been so big nor strong enough to injury the qb, making the defenders confused whether the qb throws the ball or keeps the ball for qb draw. Nihon sometimes used the Dragonfly formation which is a kind of the shotgun formation, and two quarterbacks are aligned at the same time in the formation. These qb's also play the dual role of qb and tailback, then it is almost the same as if four players were aligned in the backfield. Nihon scored two touchdowns using the formation against the College of William & Mary at the Ivy Bowl in 1993.\n\nThe Nihon University Phoenix has played friendly exhibition games against the Kwansei Gakuin University Fighters for forty years, and during an exhibition match on May 6, 2018, a defensive player of Phoenix tackled a quarterback of Fighters from behind at least two seconds after throwing an incomplete-pass. The quarterback was forced to leave the game. Also, the defender committed three fouls in the match. However, he was in tears at the bench after substituted off. Just after the match, the Phoenix head coach commented on the defender's plays as if he approved of the fouls or encouraged the players to commit them. This dangerous illegal late-hit and the coach's comment stirred a national controversy. \n\nEx-NFL line-backer Masafumi Kawaguchi pointed out that he'd never seen anything like the late-hit that became a problem. The Kwansei Gakuin University formally protested to the Nihon University, and accused Nihon of intentionally trying to hurt the quarterback. Daichi Suzuki, the chief of the government's Japan Sports Agency, launched an inquiry and called the play into question. \n\nThe quarterback was damaged in his spine. The defender who injured him was obviously ordered to make dirty tackles by Nihon Phoenix coaches, and later admitted it in public according to his conscience. The head coach of Nihon, nevertheless, denied that he had ordered his players to play dirty and resigned as coach without giving veracity in explain. Anger spread in nation-wide.\n\nReporters of \"New York Times\" speculated that this controversy related to deep-rooted cultural dynamics including what the Japanese call “power hara”.\n"}

Stallworth then bounced off a tackle attempt by Jaguars cornerback Fernando Bryant and turned inside and broke two more tackles. The clock had already reached zero, and Stallworth pitched the ball to the 34-yard line to Michael Lewis, who ran the ball to the 25-yard line of Jacksonville. He then turned and pitched the ball to Deuce McAllister, who ran to the Jaguars' 20-yard line. McAllister then pitched the ball to the right side of the field to Jerome Pathon, who caught the ball at the 24-yard line of Jacksonville. Brooks, who had hustled all the way downfield, then laid a block on the last Jaguars defender and Pathon dove into the end-zone.\n\nThere was a lengthy delay while the officials determined that all of the ball transfers (after the pass to Stallworth) were indeed legal laterals. All the Saints needed was a John Carney extra point to send the game into overtime (Saints coach Jim Haslett eschewed a two-point conversion attempt to win the game immediately).\n\nCarney lined up to kick the extra point, hit a dead push, and the kick sailed wide right. The famous reaction of Saints play-by-play radio announcer Jim Henderson was a horrified scream: \"NOOOO!!! He missed the extra point wide right! Oh my God, how could he do that?\" With no time remaining on the clock, the game was over, giving the Jaguars an improbable 20–19 victory.\n\nEarlier in the season, Coach Haslett had stated to the media that he trusted Carney so much, that he'd even stake his life on him. When reminded later that day of those same comments, Haslett stated, \"Then I'd probably be dead right now. He's one of the great all-time kickers. I never would have guessed this would happen.\"\n\nWith the loss, the Saints fell to 7–8 on the season and were eliminated from contention for the 2003 NFL playoffs. However, even if the Saints had won in overtime, they would have been eliminated from the playoffs, as the Dallas Cowboys won their tenth game of the season that day (9 was the highest possible number of wins the Saints could have had if they won) and the Seahawks eventually won their tenth game to gain a wild card. The Saints would, however, finish their season on a high note the next week with a 13–7 home victory over the playoff bound Dallas Cowboys. For the Jaguars, the victory would lift them to a 5–10 record. They would go on to lose the next week, 21–14, to the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThe River City Relay later went on to win the 2004 Best Play ESPY Award.\n\n\n\n"}

Opened in 2009, it is the home field of the Minnesota Golden Gophers of the Big Ten Conference, and the temporary home of Minnesota United FC of Major League Soccer. The stadium also served as the temporary home of the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2014 and 2015 seasons during the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium. The 50,805-seat \"horseshoe\" style stadium cost $303.3 million to build and is designed to support future expansion to seat up to 80,000.\n\nIt was the first new Big Ten football stadium constructed since Memorial Stadium at Indiana University opened in 1960. TCF Bank Stadium also boasts the largest home locker room in college or professional football and one of the largest video boards in the nation. Super Bowl winning coach and former quarterback for the Golden Gophers Tony Dungy called the stadium \"unbelievable\" and Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Cris Carter said that the on-campus facility \"will give the University of Minnesota a chance to compete not only in the Big Ten but nationally for some of the best athletes\".\n\nThe stadium is the third on-campus stadium and fourth stadium used for U of M football. Previous venues have been Northrop Field, Memorial Stadium, and Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. It is the first of three spectator sports stadiums that have been built for the major tenants of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome – the Gophers and two professional teams, the Minnesota Twins baseball and Minnesota Vikings football teams.\n\nThe Gopher football program played its first game there on September 12, 2009 against the Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy, prevailing 20-13. This was the first football game played on-campus since November 21, 1981, the last game in Memorial Stadium. The highest-ranked AP Top 25 team to visit was #2 TCU in 2015. Iowa is 3-3 against Minnesota in rivalry games played at \"The Bank\", and one of two ranked opponents that the Gophers have defeated in the new facility (#24 Iowa in 2010 and #21 Nebraska in 2013). At the conclusion of the 2018 season, the Gopher football team has an all-time record of 41 - 29 (0.5857) in games played at TCF Bank Stadium.\n\nThe push for a new on-campus stadium for Golden Gopher football began in the fall of 2000. The university cited poor revenue and lack of a college football atmosphere at the off-campus Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome as their main reasons for wanting to move back on campus. A plan for a joint Minnesota Vikings/University of Minnesota football stadium was proposed in 2002, but differences over how the stadium would be designed and managed, as well as state budget constraints, led to the plan's failure. In September 2003 a highly publicized attempt was made by T. Denny Sanford to be the lead donor for the project, but in early 2004 the plan fell through when the two parties were unable to come to an agreement on the financial terms. The university unveiled preliminary stadium drawings and a general plan to seek state money and donations in December 2003. On March 24, 2005, the university and TCF Bank announced a deal that would have the bank contribute $35 million towards the project which would give them naming rights. The deal was given an expiration date of December 31, 2005; time enough for the Minnesota Legislature to provide the bulk of funding needed to make the project a reality.\n\nDuring the remainder of 2005 the university concentrated on drafting a stadium proposal that would draw the support of state politicians. The final plan proposed that the state of Minnesota would contribute 40% of the stadium cost while the university would raise the remaining 60% on its own. Portions of that 60% were to be funded by the TCF naming rights, while the remainder would come from a $50 per semester student fee, private donations, the sale of 2,840 acres (11.5 km²) of university land in rural Dakota County back to the state, and game day parking revenue. Even though the university proposal drew widespread legislative support, the stadium effort suffered a setback when the 2005 legislative session ended before the stadium bill could be heard. Late in 2005 when it became evident that this would happen, the university and TCF Bank announced that it had extended the naming rights deal to June 30, 2006.\nDespite the 2005 session having ended with the bill not coming to a vote, the stadium effort did not lose momentum in the legislature and was introduced quickly in the 2006 session. On April 6, 2006, the Minnesota House of Representatives passed the stadium bill on a 103–30 vote. The house bill was nearly identical to what the university was proposing and had full university support. However, on May 9, 2006, the Minnesota Senate passed a radically different version of the bill on a 34–32 vote. The Senate version would have removed the TCF naming rights deal, the student fees, and the purchase of the university owned land. The proposed funding that was removed was to be replaced with a statewide tax on sports memorabilia. It also would have required the stadium to be named Veterans Memorial Stadium (similar to the previous on-campus football stadium Memorial Stadium, which was last used in 1981 and demolished in 1992). Governor Tim Pawlenty stated he supported the House version. He signed the bill in May 2006 at the University of Minnesota McNamara Alumni Center.\n\nEven though the differences between the House and Senate bills were major, the details were ironed out and approved on May 19, in a House–Senate conference committee. The naming rights and land sale remained in the bill, as did a scaled down $25 per year student fee. The tax on sports memorabilia as well as the Veterans Memorial Stadium name were voted out. The committee also voted to increase the state contribution to the project to compensate for the smaller student fees. The compromise bill was then approved by both the full house and senate on May 20, and was signed by Governor Tim Pawlenty on May 24.\n\nOn June 8, 2006, the university announced that it had selected Populous to design the stadium. Populous (then HOK Sport) was one of the three finalists, along with HNTB Architects and Crawford Architects, that made presentations to the university on May 24, 2006. The local firm that worked on the project was Minneapolis-based \"Architectural Alliance\", and M.A. Mortenson Company was the general contractor. Schematic designs of the stadium were presented to the public on January 3, 2007.\n\nInfrastructure work at the stadium site began in late June 2006, and a ceremonial groundbreaking took place at the stadium site on September 30, 2006. The beginning of construction on the stadium itself along with the unveiling of the stadium's logo took place on July 11, 2007. Site preparation and foundation work continued through the summer and fall of 2007. More than 8,800 tons of steel that make up the stadium's skeleton was put in place between January 28, 2007 – June 28, 2008.\n\nThe stadium is located on the northeast side of the Minneapolis campus, near the site of the former Memorial Stadium, across from Williams Arena. The site was previously the Huron Boulevard Parking Complex, where the university's four largest parking lots were located. The address is 2009 University Ave S.E.\n\nThe stadium is part of a expansion of the Twin Cities campus, the largest since the West Bank was built in the 1960s. Current plans for the area call for the construction of as many as ten new academic buildings by 2015. The METRO Green Line light rail runs near the stadium, with a station in Stadium Village serving the facility. Construction of the Green Line began in 2010 and opened June 14, 2014. The two other major Twin Cities stadiums are located along this line, within a short distance and travel time on the Light rail line.\n\nAn environmental impact assessment of the stadium site was conducted by the university between December 2004 and March 2006 at a cost of $1.5 million. The results were approved by the Board of Regents on March 27, 2006.\n\nThe stadium is a horseshoe-style stadium which organizers said would have a \"traditional collegiate look and feel\". On December 7, 2006, the university announced that the stadium's field would be laid out in an unorthodox east-west configuration, with the open west end of the stadium facing campus. This layout, similar to that of Memorial Stadium, provides a view of downtown Minneapolis.\n\nOn September 18, 2009, the University of Minnesota announced that the stadium was awarded LEED Silver Certification, the first college or professional football stadium to achieve LEED certification.\n\nThe centerpiece of the stadium is the massive scoreboard, designed and built by Daktronics at a cost of $9 million. At , the HD-X light-emitting diode (LED) video scoreboard is currently the largest in college football-only stadiums, and was the third largest at the time of construction.\n\nThe playing surface is FieldTurf, an infilled artificial turf, and the brick wall surrounding the playing field was made possible by an alumni donation of $500,000.\n\nLocated on the stadium ground level is the Murray Warmath Locker Room, named in honor of the Gophers' national championship winning coach from 1954 to 1971. It is the largest home locker room in college or professional football, and features a block “M” lighting fixture and 120 custom-built cherry-wood lockers. Adjacent to the Murray Warmath Locker Room are other team areas including a fully equipped training room, therapy room, medical exam rooms, an equipment room, custom coaches’ offices and locker rooms, a home media room, private recruiting room, and a training table for dining and nutrition.\nAfter a tour of the complex, Pro Bowl wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald remarked that, \"This has got to be the best locker room in the Big Ten.\"\n\nTo recognize that the venue was paid for with taxes statewide and to pay tribute to the support of Minnesota citizens, the names of the state's 87 counties are cast in stone around the perimeter of the first level. Each is engraved in a piece of cast stone that is and weighs . These panels are contained within the reminiscent Memorial Wall, which forms the external surface of the stadium building. This brick façade perimeter wall with arched portals reflects the heritage of Memorial Stadium's exterior, and a 360° colonnade provides a year-round walkway around the stadium. Displayed on the façade of the stadium's upper deck are panels commemorating the 7 national championships and 18 Big Ten Conference championships won by Minnesota in football, as well as ones distinguishing the five players whose numbers have been retired by the program.\n\nThe Minnesota Tribal Nations Plaza encompasses the main western entrance to the stadium and is named in honor of the 11 Native American nations in Minnesota, featuring eleven -tall sky markers: one for each nation. The stadium also incorporates the Veterans Tribute, a memorial dedicated to Minnesota veterans, located in the open end of the horseshoe near the main plaza.\n\nThe first phase of the construction includes approximately 50,805 seats, with the design able to support future expansion of up to 80,000 seats. The 10,000-seat student section is located in the eastern end of the stadium, and the area reserved for the University of Minnesota Marching Band is partitioned from it, situated directly behind the eastern end zone and framed by a backdrop labeled \"Pride of Minnesota.\" There are approximately 20,000 seats with permanent chairbacks in the stadium, located between the goal lines in both the upper and lower decks, but all remaining locations have aluminum bench seating with no backs. The stadium also features 1,000 handicap accessible and companion seats, and accessible seating is located throughout the stadium, including in the first row of the first level, the last row of the first level, and the last row of the second level. Premium seating includes 37 private suites, 250 indoor club seats, 1,250 outdoor club seats, and 50 loge boxes, along with access to the exclusive climate-controlled DQ Club Room, which offers luxurious amenities to premium-seat ticket holders.\n\nThe main concourse is on the second level and wraps around the entire stadium, open to the field of play. Concessions and many of the venue's 113 restrooms are located here.\n\nLocated in the southwest corner of the stadium is Goldy's Locker Room, the team store, which spans two floors. The T. Denny Sanford Athletics Hall of Fame was opened in fall of 2010, positioned in the southwest end of the stadium next to Goldy's Locker Room. The more than Hall of Fame is not football specific, rather encompassing all 25 of the University of Minnesota's athletic programs through dramatic imagery, artifacts, and interactive kiosks. Visitors to the Hall of Fame hear a soundscape with some of the great radio calls from Minnesota's play-by-play voices. The space also honors the members of the 'M' Club Hall of Fame with a wall complete with plaques for each inductee. The Hall of Fame housed the Floyd of Rosedale trophy after a win over Iowa in 2010.\n\nThe media area is a three-tiered press box with 10 network TV camera positions and seating for 160 members of the media.\n\nThe stadium was designed to be capable of supporting future seating expansion to 80,000. The 30,000 seats would be added above the second deck of the stadium from the end of the press boxes across to the northwest end of the venue, wrapping around the remainder of the horseshoe. The auxiliary video display currently adjacent to the easternmost section of the media areas would likely be relocated to atop the new third deck. The University of Minnesota could add all 30,000 seats in a single addition or in increments of 10,000 seats, meeting demand as it is needed (although the duplicated costs of such a plan make it unlikely). If expansion is ever undertaken, it can be completed in about 9 months so that there would be minimal interruption of a football season.\n\nFor the 2014 and 2015 seasons, the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL) used TCF Bank Stadium as their home venue while their new venue, U.S. Bank Stadium, was under construction at the site of the Metrodome. To help accommodate the Vikings, TCF Bank Stadium underwent several changes, including a new playing surface with heating coils, increased storage space throughout the stadium, and concession upgrades. In addition, temporary seats were installed that increased the stadium's capacity to 52,525. These accommodations were expected to cost about $7 million - an amount attributed to the overall construction cost of the new stadium\n\nThe stadium's cost totals $288.5 million, of which the university will pay 52% and the state of Minnesota the remaining 48%. Including interest the state's cost is about $10 million per year or about $1.7 million per game for 25 years. About $50 million of the state's portion goes to the purchase of 2,840 acres (11.5 km²) of undeveloped university land, part of the Rosemount Research Center in Dakota County, over 25 years by the state of Minnesota who will assume responsibility for risks if the site requires environmental cleanup. The university retains its right to use the land for its \"research, education and engagement mission\" in perpetuity.\n\nThe university's share was $111 million or 52%. TCF Financial Corporation of Wayzata, Minnesota is contributing $35 million over 25 years in exchange for the \"TCF Bank\" naming rights and other agreements. The university projected earnings of $2.5 million per year or $96 million over the life of agreements with TCF that will include marketing debit cards to alumni and ticketholders. If unable to fulfill its contractual obligations, TCF Financial Corporation must propose an alternate name subject to the approval of the university. Other corporate donations have been pledged as well, including Best Buy ($3 million), Dairy Queen ($2.5 million), Target Corporation ($2 million), Federated Insurance, General Mills, and Norwest Equity Partners.\nThe university also accepts donations from individuals. Initially donations were only being sought from \"high-end\" donors (those contributing $100,000 or more), but in June 2008 the university expanded the fundraising effort to gather smaller donations as well. On May 21, 2009, the University announced they had received a $6 million donation from T. Denny Sanford, meaning the university had achieved its goal of $86 million in private fund raising. The remainder of the university's portion will come from a $12.50 per semester student fee ($25 per year) and game day parking revenue.\n\nEven though the cost of building TCF Bank Stadium originated at $248.7 million, changes in the construction planning raised the cost to $288.5 million. The university has vowed that even if the stadium cost rises again, it will not seek more money from the state nor increase the student fees any further.\n\nThe University has been charging all U of M students a mandatory stadium fee of $12.50 every semester since planning for the project began, and is continuing this fee despite the stadium being finished. The cost of the stadium was $288.5 million of which the university had to pay 52%, and with an average of more than 50,000 students in a given year, in one semester the university makes more than $625,000 from the stadium fee, meaning they receive more than $12.5 million every 10 years from students.\n\nThe Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC) agreed to donate $10 million for stadium construction, the largest gift Gopher athletics has ever received. The university matched an additional $2.5 million to create a $5 million endowment for scholarships for Native American and low-income students. The hospitality plaza on the stadium's west side and the scholarship were named to honor the community, and the plaza designed to \"... celebrate the history, presence, and cultural contributions of all eleven Native American tribes in Minnesota\". The University received an additional $2 million from the SMSC for construction of the plaza in 2009.\n\nUniversity president Robert Bruininks originally planned to have the school apply for a state liquor license in order to serve beer and wine in limited areas of the stadium. Under his proposal, alcohol would have been available only to occupants of premium season ticket seats ranging in price from $1,800 to $45,000 a year. This is/was consistent with the University's long-held alcohol policy at other on-campus athletic venues, such as Williams Arena and Mariucci Arena. This is also consistent with other NCAA institutions (including all other Big Ten Conference teams except for the University of Michigan and Ohio State University) with on-campus stadiums. No Big Ten stadiums serve alcohol in their general seating.\n\nIn May 2009, the state legislature passed a law that states that no alcohol may be served or sold anywhere in the stadium, including in suites and premium boxes, unless all ticketholders 21 or older in the stadium can buy alcohol at a game. The University of Minnesota regents voted on June 24, 2009, on Bruininks' subsequent proposal to ban alcohol entirely at campus athletic events (and also ban it in Mariucci and Williams arenas), which passed 10–2.\n\nIn May 2010, the legislature passed a law saying that alcohol could be served in premium seating if it was also available in one-third of the general seats. Bruininks declined to ask the board of regents to make this compromise. Dan Wolter, a spokesman for the university, said, \"We recognize and understand that underage drinking is a big problem in our society as a whole so that is a stand that the University wanted to take.\"\n\nOn July 11, 2012, the university regents voted to allow beer sales at the stadium starting in the fall of 2012.\n\nDue to a collapse of the Metrodome's roof, the Minnesota Vikings' Monday Night Football game against the Chicago Bears was held at the stadium on December 20, 2010, which was the Vikings' first outdoor home game since exactly 29 years before when Metropolitan Stadium was closed. The game ended with the Bears defeating the Vikings, 40−14. With the win, the Bears won the NFC North title and Devin Hester broke the kickoff return for touchdown record. This was Brett Favre's last game in the NFL after he sustained a concussion from being hit by Corey Wootton.\n\nThe Vikings played the 2014 and 2015 NFL seasons at the stadium during construction of U.S. Bank Stadium, which required the demolition of the Metrodome. TCF Bank Stadium was the smallest stadium in the NFL by seat capacity for those two seasons. The Vikings reportedly paid $2 million for upkeep costs for those seasons. The Vikings also spent $4.5 million to upgrade the facilities to NFL standards, mainly to include heating coils under the turf. The Vikings used the north sideline (opposite the press box) in 2014-15.\n\nThe stadium hosted an outdoor NCAA hockey game between the Minnesota Golden Gophers and Ohio State Buckeyes on January 17, 2014. The Gophers won 1-0 with 45,021 fans in attendance. It also hosted to its first NHL contest on February 21, 2016 between the Minnesota Wild and the Chicago Blackhawks as part of the 2016 NHL Stadium Series. The Wild won 6–1 in front of 50,426 fans.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4214895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4214895", "title": "Table hockey games", "text": "Table hockey games\n\nA table hockey game, also called rod hockey game, stick hockey, bubble hockey, and board hockey, is a game for two players, derived from ice hockey. The game consists of a representation of a hockey rink; the players score goals by hitting a small puck into the opposing \"net\" with cutout figures that represent hockey players. The figures are manipulated by rods below the \"ice\": each one slides forward and back along its own narrow slot when the player pushes or pulls on the rod, or rotates (about a vertical axis) to shoot or stickhandle the puck when the player spins the rod. Though similar in concept to air hockey (commonly known as \"glide hockey\"), table hockey games are more of a simulation of the sport of ice hockey while air hockey is more abstract.\n\nThe game of table hockey was invented in 1932, by the Canadian Donald H. Munro Sr., in Toronto. Don, like so many Canadians in the depths of the depression, was short of cash for Christmas presents. He had a wife and three young children. That year, the family all pitched in and made the first table hockey game. This mechanical game was built out of scrap wood and metal, and included used coat hanger wire, butcher's twine, clock springs, and lumber from the coal bin. Unlike current games, the game looked more like an early pinball game, with one key difference: this was a two player game. The playing surface had a peak in the middle and sloped down toward each end. The players controlled levers for the goalie and flippers for the players. The story goes that a travelling salesman noticed the game and encouraged Don to take the game down to the local Eaton's department store. Don did just that. The first game went in on a consignment deal. By the time Mr. Munro got home, the game was sold and more orders were placed.\n\nThere are many types of the game. The defunct Munro Games of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, manufactured the original variant of the game in Burlington, Ontario. Stiga Games in Sweden are used in the table hockey sport administered by the International Table Hockey Federation.\n\nThe game has also been played using a variety of commercial boards in North America since the 1920s. Rick Benej, of Greenwich, NY, has built table hockey games since the 1980s. His model has gone through three different designs and refinements over the years. The most popular board for many years was manufactured by the now-defunct Coleco company, and most North American boards (such as those built by The Carrom Company and Irwin toys) are a variant of this model. However, the Stiga board has begun to tap the North American market, even as other new boards continue to be introduced.\n\nThe arcade version is called 'dome hockey' or 'bubble hockey', because of the large plastic dome that covers the playing surface in order to prevent the puck either becoming lost or stolen. The most popular of these 'bubble hockey' tables is Chexx (USA vs. Soviet Union) and its successor, Super Chexx (Canada vs. USA).\n\nAnother table hockey game, called Do-To-Ho, is completely different from the other games specified here. The play figures are not fastened to bars, but are mobile on the whole playing field. In their bases, just like in the puck, there is a ball bearing, so they slide like ice skate runners over the board.\nMoving a play figure is done via a short, unique knock against the figure with a small stick as in billiards. The play courses take place alternating, there are 'attack courses', with which the puck may be played by a play figure, and 'position courses' (defense courses as well as offside release courses), with which a play figure only may change position without touching the puck. Puck possession changes, if the aggressor misses the puck or hits an opposing play figure.\nDo-To-Ho was developed in Germany and published in 1994.\n\n\n"}

Descended from the Aztec version of the Mesoamerican ballgame, the game is one of the oldest continuously played sports in the world and is notable for the fact that it is the oldest known game using a rubber ball.\n\nThe word \"ulama\" comes from the Nahuatl word \"ōllamaliztli\" a combination of \"ōllamas\" (playing of a game with a ball) and \"ōllei\" (rubber). \"Ōllamaliztli\" was the Aztec name for the Mesoamerican ballgame, whose roots extended back to at least the 2nd millennium BC and evidence of which has been found in nearly all Mesoamerican cultures in an area extending from modern-day Mexico to El Salvador, and possibly in modern-day Arizona and New Mexico. Archaeologists have uncovered rubber balls dating to at least 1600 BC, ballgamer figures from at least 1200 BC, and nearly 1500 ancient ball courts.\n\nHowever, due to its religious and ritual aspects, Spanish Catholics suppressed the game soon after the Spanish conquest, leaving it to survive in areas such as Sinaloa, where Spanish influence was less pervasive.\n\nUlama games are played on a temporary court called a \"tastei\" (, from \"tlachtli\" , the Nahuatl word meaning \"ballcourt\"). The bounds of these long narrow courts are made by drawing or chalking thick lines in the dirt. The courts are divided into opposing sides by a center line, called an \"analco\". A ball that is allowed to cross the end line, the \"chichi\" or \"chivo\", will result in a point for the opposing team. Points or \"rayas\" (\"lines\", so named for the tally marks used to keep score) are gained in play. The scoring system provides for resetting the score to zero in certain conditions, which can make for lengthy games.\n\nThe modern-day game has three main forms:\n\n\nThe object of the game is to keep the ball in play and in bounds. Depending on the score — and the local variant of the rules — the ball is played either high or low. A team scores a point when a player of the opposing team hits the ball out of turn; misses the ball; knocks the ball out of bounds; touches the ball with their hands or some other body part aside from the hip; accidentally touches a teammate; lets the ball stop moving before it reaches the centre line or even if they fail to announce the score after they have scored a point.\n\nThe first team that scores eight points wins. If both teams end up having the same number of points after a turn, both sides begin again from zero. One record-setting game reportedly lasted for eight days, but most modern games are stopped after about two hours.\n\n\"See also Mesoamerican rubber balls\"\n\n\n\n"}
