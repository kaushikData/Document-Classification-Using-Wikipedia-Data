It was held at the Polideportivo Máximo Viloria in Barquisimeto, Venezuela between 8–10 June. Twenty-five nations and a total of 398 athletes participated at the competition.\n\nInitially set to be held in the country's capital Caracas, the competition was moved to Maracay in April 2011. The Venezuelan Sports Ministry had not committed any funds for the event. As a result, the president of the Venezuelan Athletics Federation, Wilfredy León, rescheduled the event following the promise of the Aragua state governor Rafael Isea to help build a new stadium for the championships. However, the new stadium and purpose-built accommodation for the event were not ready within schedule. The event was postponed from May to June, but the project remained off-target and in May 2012 Héctor Rodríguez, the Venezuelan Sports Minister, declared that the competition would be held in Barquisimeto (the host of the 2003 South American Championships).\n\nThe highlight performances were two South American records by Brazilians in the women's section. Andressa de Morais threw a record in the discus throw and Lucimara da Silva's heptathlon score was also a Championship record. Barquisimeto native Rosa Rodríguez also set a championship record in the women's hammer throw, while Colombia's James Rendon was the only man to break a competition record, bettering the 20,000 metres walk time.\n\nArgentine thrower German Lauro won both the men's shot put and discus events. Ecuador's Alex Quiñonez was the only other athlete to take two individual titles (100 m and 200 m), although Evelyn dos Santos came close by winning the 200 m and finishing second in the 100 m. Becoming one of the oldest gold medallists at the competition, 39-year-old Romary Rifka, who first participated in 1988, won the women's high jump. Brazil, which sent the largest delegation, topped the medal table with fourteen gold medals and a total of 44 overall. Cuba (leaders in 2010) came second with eight golds and eighteen medals. Colombia was third, on six golds, and the hosts Venezuela performed well on home turf, taking fourth place in the table and ten medals from the competition. In addition to the two area records, eleven national records were broken during the competition.\n\nTwenty-four members of the Asociación Iberoamericana de Atletismo sent athletes to the event. The level of athlete participation (362 in total) was relatively high compared to previous years although non-American countries representation was rather poor. Aruba participated for the first time. The five member nations not competing were Andorra, Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau and São Tomé and Príncipe.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It opened in 1957, and was demolished in 1987. It was notable for its innovative construction, as the dome was created by pouring concrete over a mound of packed earth that was subsequently removed. The auditorium was located east of Downtown on Grand Avenue (now Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ave.), between St. Joseph Hospital and Interstate 25. It opened in 1957 and had a capacity of 6,000 people.\n\nThe Albuquerque Civic Auditorium was designed by the Albuquerque firm of Ferguson, Stevens and Associates in 1955. Architects Gordon Ferguson and Donald Stevens came up with the idea of using an earthen mound as a form for the poured-in-place concrete dome. An existing hill on the site was built up and shaped to the proper dimensions, followed by a ten-day concrete pour. The earth was then excavated from under the dome to create the arena space. The finished dome was high, in diameter, and varied in thickness from at the center to at the edges. The innovative construction technique garnered a mention in \"Life\" and was also praised by Frank Lloyd Wright during a lecture at the University of New Mexico in 1956.\n\nThe venue opened on April 27, 1957, with a performance by the Albuquerque Civic Symphony. Over the years the venue hosted a number of notable acts, including Led Zeppelin in 1969 and Jimi Hendrix in 1970, just three months before his death. It was also the home venue of the University of Albuquerque Dons basketball team from 1963 to 1969. However, the auditorium had poor acoustics and eventually fell from popularity as a music venue in favor of Tingley Coliseum and Popejoy Hall. It was demolished in 1987.\n"}

The first event at the arena was a basketball game against the Ohio University Bobcats, which ended in a 68-59 Youngstown State victory.\n\nThe arena, which originally seated 6,000, has undergone many changes since its opening. The Youngstown State women's basketball team moved into the arena in the mid-1970s. In 1983, permanent seats at both ends of the court and 1,260 chairback seats at mid-court were added. On September 15, 1996, YSU dedicated Veterans' Plaza directly in front of Beeghly Center. This $500,000 community project was funded in-part through private donations to honor all United States Veterans. In 2000, the court was repainted, two additional scoreboards were added and expanded press-row seating was created. In May 2002, the facility underwent more than $2.5 million in additional renovations, including a new front and rear lobby, new hallways and locker rooms and a new $150,000 sound system.\n\nThe multipurpose facility includes an Olympic-sized swimming and diving facility, racquetball and squash courts, classrooms, and administrative offices. Beeghly is also home to the men's and women's basketball offices as well as the Olympic sports offices.\n\nIn addition to YSU intercollegiate basketball and volleyball contests, as well as university events, Beeghly Center has served as the site for high school competitions, World Wrestling Entertainment matches (though the WWE now uses the newer Covelli Centre nearby when visiting Youngstown), concerts, tradeshows, and numerous other functions that dot the busy facility schedule throughout the year. The venue also hosted a Barack Obama rally in February 2008.\n\nThe Beeghly Center holds many YSU classes throughout each semester, as well as the Youngstown City School District's \"All-City\" Science Fair competition. The facility is used for graduation ceremonies at the end of every semester.\n\nThe facility should not be confused with the nearby—and newer—Beeghly Hall, where YSU's Beeghly College of Education is housed, and also holds YSU classes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8226125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8226125", "title": "Crocker (sport)", "text": "Crocker (sport)\n\nCrocker (sometimes spelled \"Croccer\") is a team sport played between two large teams. Its origins are in cricket and baseball. It also makes the use of a rugby ball which may explain its name. It is a casual sport not played formally, but often found on British summer camps.\n\nCrocker is played between two teams of undefined size, typically between 10 and 50 per side. The teams are not necessarily exactly even, though they are usually of similar size. Alternatively, a lack of skill on the side of one team may be made up for by a numerical advantage (for example in the case of many children playing against fewer adults).\n\nCrocker fields vary, but will often take advantage of whatever space is available. Often taking place on large, flat, grassy school fields, a crocker pitch may not have defined outer limits.\n\nA generally agreed setup will involve a semicircular bowling and batting area usually marked out with cones. The batsman stands in the middle of the flat edge of the semicircle while the bowler stands opposite him on the curved edge. A \"wicket\" is set up behind the batsman, as in cricket, usually made of four cricket stumps set up to make a wider version of real cricket stumps or in another variation of the game a chair may be used as the wicket.\n\nBehind the stumps stands a fielding player, or sometimes two; this position is usually called the wicket-keeper. At either corner of the semicircle are two more stumps set up, between which the batsmen may run.\n\nThe rest of the fielding team stand anywhere in front of the batsman and outside the semicircle. The fielding team are not allowed inside the semicircle while the ball is being bowled, and at any time typically only six players are allowed on the edge of the semicircle. The rest of the fielding team tends to spread out to field and catch shots played by the batsman.\n\nIn the general case, apart from the batsman, none of the batting team is allowed on the field of play. Instead, they line up several meteres behind the batsman to watch and prepare to bat. However some variations on the rules make use of the 'disrupting rule', whereby 5 members of the batting team are allowed to enter the field of play and disrupt the fielders as they try to recover the ball. The \"disrupters\" have to follow three clear rules. First, they must not touch the ball with their hands (unless they are inside the bowling/batting area and are permitted to use their hands to remove the ball from the semicircle.) Secondly there must be no physical contact between a disrupter and any member of the fielding team. And thirdly the disrupters may not interfere with the ball when it is on its way back to the bowler.\n\nIf an umpire is present, they will usually stand at one of the corners. Their role is to count the runs and to uphold the rules and make decisions during the game.\n\nAny equipment is often made up of things that are to hand, but usually they consist of a football-sized ball, though a softer ball may often be used to prevent injury (for example, a volleyball). Sometimes even a rugby ball is used.\n\nThe batsman's bat is usually a baseball bat, or a rounders bat, although cricket bats have been known to be used.\n\nDuring play, the bowler will bowl the ball, trying to hit the stumps. Unlike cricket, the bowler can bowl continuously, as soon as he or she receives the ball, whether the batsman is in position or not. The following rules apply to a ball bowled by the bowler at the batsman:\n\n\nThe bowler and the six fielders on the edge of the semicircle are rotated at regular intervals (10 to 30 balls bowled).\n\nA batsman can be dismissed in a variety of ways. The usual rules of crocker include the following:\n\n\nThere are also often various other methods of dismissal for crocker batsman, especially relating to sportsmanship. Loosely connected to this is being retired, which is to be taken from batting, usually either on reaching a certain score or batting for a certain time.\n\nCrocker is unique in the rotation between batsmen. As soon as one is out, the bowler may immediately bowl another ball, if he or she has the ball, even if the next batsman is not ready and in position, then he or she is given out if out in any of the above ways. This is most likely to do with the length of the game; with the potential for over 100 batsmen in a match the emphasis is on speed and participation of everyone.\n\nCrocker is won by the team who, at the end of the match, has more runs. The runs are counted by the umpire.\n\nSpecial rules of crocker are often employed. The most common of these are:\n\n\nThere is not much scope for tactics in crocker, but there are some that can be employed more by individuals than as a team.\n\n\nAlternatively\n\nIf caught out a player is only half out.\nIf a player performs a \"double hit\" then they are one third out\nIf the amount to which a player is out is greater than 1 then they are fully out.\nA player is still fully out straight away if they are bowled out (except on their first hit).\n\n"}

It was home to the Eastern Washington State College (EWSC) Eagles basketball team until the Reese Court opened in 1975. The facility was destroyed by fire on April 25, 1977.\n\nThe fieldhouse was moved to EWSC in 1947 and opened in 1948. The building had been located 70 miles away at Farragut Naval Training Station in Bayview, Idaho, where it had been used for drill. At EWSC the 800 foot long building was home to a gymnasium and swimming pool.\n\nIn the fall of 1976 the building was condemned for life safety code violations. \nEWSC contracted with George Kelp Building Wrecking Company of Spokane for the building's demolition. Old bolts in the buildings roof construction could not be removed without cutting them out, and therefore a welder's torch was used.\n\nAt 11:10am, the Cheney fire department got the call that the Fieldhouse was on fire. Twice before, small fires had been accidentally started by the demolition team. But this fire was different. The fire was started when a spark from a welder's torch found fuel in a pile of the building's dismantled material. With more than half the roof already removed, a \"wind tunnel\" effect was created as the fire pulled in the oxygen it needed to quickly grow. By 11:12am, the fire Chief was on the scene and sounded a mutual aid alarm. More than 30 firefighters from around the district responded. Within 10 minutes, the entire Fieldhouse was engulfed in flames. The blaze was so hot that reportedly cars parked almost 100 feet away were \"scorched.\" A Cheney fire truck was even damaged by the heat. The firefighters, realizing the building was a complete loss, focused on containment and protecting the surrounding buildings. The fire wasn't under control until 2:00pm. But winds in the area required crews to remain on scene an additional 12 hours.\n\nThe Cheney Fire Department Chief Tony Singleton estimated that fire damage to the departments equipment exceeded $6,000. Total damage figures for the ROTC building came out at over $250,00 according to Singleton. The ROTC building's roof was so badly damaged that classes had to be held in another building for nearly a year. Sixteen firemen were treated for smoke inhalation and one fireman was treated for a cut on his hand.According to Singleton the toll of the fire could have been more serious than it turned out to be. Lt. Gene Bloom almost lost his life due to a falling roof shortly after responding to the fire.\n\nEastern Washington State College sought reimbursement for the $70,000,000 worth of damages to the campus facilities.\n"}

{"id": "762941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=762941", "title": "Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)", "text": "Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)\n\nExposition Park was the name given to three historic stadiums, located in what is today Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The fields were used mainly for professional baseball and American football from c. 1879 to c. 1915. The ballparks were initially located on the north side of the Allegheny River in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania. The city was annexed into Pittsburgh (then often spelled \"Pittsburg\") in 1907, which became the city's North Side, located across from Pittsburgh's downtown area. Due to flooding from the nearby river, the three stadiums' exact locations varied somewhat. The final version of the ballpark was between the eventual sites of Three Rivers Stadium and PNC Park.\n\nIn 1903, the third incarnation of Exposition Park was the first National League ballpark to host a World Series game. The Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP)—known today as the University of Pittsburgh—played home football games at Exposition Park, and also used the park as a home field for the university's baseball team.\n\nNamed for other \"expositions\" that would be shown there, including horse racing and circuses, Exposition Park I was the first venue in Pittsburgh that hosted baseball. In 1882, the Pittsburgh Pirates—then known simply as Allegheny, or informally as \"the Alleghenys\"—began play at Exposition Park as a member of the American Association; however, after one season a fire and flooding of the field from the nearby River forced a second park to be built. Despite its reason for construction Exposition Park II was built closer to the River. The Alleghenys played at the second incarnation of the park until they moved to Recreation Park in 1884, which was several blocks north and out of the flood plain.\n\nWhile the Pittsburgh Pirates were playing home games at Recreation Park, owners John Beemer and M. B. Lennon of the Pittsburgh Burghers constructed a baseball park near the former site of Exposition Park I and II, which was approximately two blocks west of where PNC Park sits today. Exposition Park III included a roofed wooden grandstand around the infield, and open bleacher sections extending to the right and left field corners. Total capacity was about 10,000 spectators. The seats faced the Allegheny River and the Point. The Burghers played at the stadium during the 1890 Players' League season— both the team and league's only season in existence. On June 10, 1890, Jocko Fields of the Pittsburgh Burghers hit the first home run at Exposition Park III.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates moved to Exposition Park the following season. On April 24, 1891, Fred Carroll hit the first home run by a Pirate in the stadium. Under the management of Fred Clarke the Pirates won the National League pennant in 1901, 1902, and 1903. After the 1903 season, Dreyfuss and Boston Americans owner Henry Killilea organized a best of nine game series to match the two pennant winners against each other. The first World Series held three games in Boston before moving to Exposition Park with the Pirates leading the series 2–1. On October 6, 1903, 7,600 people attended the first World Series game in a National League stadium—the Pirates won by one run. The following day 12,000 people attended the game, forcing some spectators to stand behind a rope in the outfield. The Pirates lost three of four games at Exposition Park and eventually the Series.\n\nDuring a July 4, 1902 doubleheader against the Brooklyn Superbas, an Allegheny flood caused water to rise to thigh level in center and right fields, and about head level in deep center. Players occasionally caught a ball and dove under the water. The Pirates won both games of the doubleheader. Ham Hyatt is believed to be the only person to hit a ball over the right field fence. Monument Hill, which overlooked the field, allowed spectators a free view of the game\n\nIn 1906, the Pirates were the first baseball team to cover their field with a tarp during inclement weather, and though the field was kept dry from the rain, the Allegheny River still caused problems. Flooding sometimes covered the entire outfield with inches of standing water, causing ground rules that gave any ground ball hit into the outfield an automatic single. In 1907, Pittsburgh's pitcher Nick Maddox threw a no-hitter at Exposition Park.\n\nIn 1908, owing to the large numbers of people that attended Pirates games, team owner Barney Dreyfuss began looking for a location to construct a new Pirates stadium. The final Pirates game at Exposition Park was played against the Chicago Cubs on June 24, 1909. The Pirates won the game 8–1 in front of 5,545 people, with George Gibson achieving the final National League hit in the ballpark. The very next day, the Pirates once again played the Cubs as the team opened Forbes Field.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Filipinos called Exposition Park their home in 1912. The Filipinos lasted just over a month after folding with the United States Baseball League. In 1914, the Pittsburgh Stogies began play at Exposition Park. In 1915, the team, renamed the Pittsburgh Rebels, despite improving from the previous season, disbanded due to financial loss with the entire Federal League. Exposition Park continued to host Semi-professional baseball games, as well as other events, but \"was eventually razed\".\n\nThe Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP), which would in 1908 be renamed the University of Pittsburgh, played its first official game at Exposition Park on October 11, 1890 when Shadyside Academy failed to show up for their game with the Allegheny Athletic Association. The Allegheny A.A. made a call to WUP team founder Bert Smyers to bring the WUP team to the park as a replacement. The WUP team was subsequently defeated 38-0. The WUP football team began playing games more regularly at Exposition Park around 1900, occasionally playing in other local venues. Prior to the 1903 season, Arthur Mosse was recruited from the University of Kansas to become the team's new coach. In addition to players that Mosse brought with him, WUP also recruited players from Geneva College to play on the team. Mosse's first season was a disappointment as the WUP football team went 0–8–1 and supporters of the team disbanded leaving the team $500 in debt. George Hubbard Clapp then organized a voluntary $5 \"athletic fee\" to be paid by students in order to allow the debt to be repaid and the school's football team to play home games at Exposition Park during the next season in order to give the WUP team a more permanent and stable home. Mosse and university officials then obtained a lease to play at Exposition Park during the fall from Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss for 20% of the admission fee. The 1904 WUP team, the first full season in which WUP played at Exposition Park, saw WUP achieve a remarkable turnaround that included a 10–0 record in which they outscored opponents 407 to 5 and finished second in the state behind the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to home games at Exposition Park, WUP students would organize parades through downtown streets prior to marching across a bridge to the game. A gong, used to announce the beginning of Pirates games, was also sounded prior to the opening kickoff of WUP football contests.\n\nAfter parts of 62 seasons in the Oakland district, baseball and football returned to the north side of the Allegheny River when Three Rivers Stadium opened. The site of the final incarnation of Exposition Park, relative to Three Rivers and the later PNC Park, was in between the two venues. Exposition Park had been on the southwest corner of South Avenue (later Robinson) to the north (first base) and School Street (later Scotland) to the east (third base). To the south (left field) was some open space and railroad tracks and the Allegheny. To the west (right field) was some open space and then Grant Street (later Galveston). That open space would eventually be the site of Three Rivers. Therefore, the site of Exposition Park was the northeast corner of the parking lot east of Three Rivers.\n\nIn 1995, members of the Society for American Baseball Research placed a plaque where home plate is believed to have been located, in honor of one of the two sites of the first World Series (the other being in Boston). In 1998, a Pennsylvania Historical marker was placed at the site of the park. Interstate 279 currently runs over portions of the site of Exposition Park just before crossing the Allegheny River along the Fort Duquesne Bridge.\n"}

{"id": "50080781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50080781", "title": "Hydroflight sports", "text": "Hydroflight sports\n\nHydroflight sports are a category of sport in which water jet propulsion is used to create sustained flight where lift and movement are controlled by a person riding on a propulsion device. It is a fast-paced sport that is growing in popularity at a fine rate of speed. Competitions for this sport started around 2012. There are many training centres throughout the world where beginners to go to learn and practice skills so they can fly these devices by themselves.\n\nThere are many different types of Hydroflight products that are used for flying. The three most common types are the Jetboards, Jetpacks and Jetbikes, but there are others such as the Hoverboard and Freedom Flyer. Different varieties of jetboards are manufactured by different companies such as Flyboard, Defy X and Wataboard. This gives buyers a choice on which style board will suite their style of use.\n\nJetboard\nThe jetboard is a device that has two jets either side of the deck, on top of the deck is where the boots/bindings (generally wakeboarding boots) are bolted in and this is where the pilot will strap themselves into. The direction and control of the jetboard comes down to the amount of propulsion being applied, the angle that your feet are pointing and the distribution of your bodyweight.\n\nJetpack\nThe jetpack is a device that is attached to your back with the two jets situated next to your shoulders. You’re held to the device by a five-point safety/racing harness (same as the ones used in race car seats). You control the direction of flight using the two handles that are attached to the jets on a 45-degree angle, by moving these controls you will change your flight path.\n\nJetbike\nThe Jetbike is a device that has a motorcycle style seat and allows its pilot to fly in a position that replicates a motorcyclist’s form. There is nothing to hold you in but two small straps located on the foot pad. The bike has one main jet underneath the seat and two smaller jets located at the front of the bike which have handles attached to them to control the direction of your flight path.\n\nFreedom flyer\nThe Freedom Flyer is a great device which can actually be used by those who may suffer from a disability to the lower half of their body. The device is in the shape of a chair which has one main jet under the seat and two jets situated on either side of it which has handles attached to either side so the pilot can alter their flight path.\n\nHoverboard\nThe Hoverboard is a snowboard style device which only has one main jet situated underneath it. It is ridden with a side-on stance and it directed by the distribution of the pilots own body-weight.\n\nHydro Fest 2016 / Session One / FlyCup / Hydroflight World Championship / Louisiana Hydroflight Invitational\n\nFlyboard European Championship 2016 / XDubai Flyboard World Cup 2015 / XDubai Hoverboard Race 2015 / North American Flyboard Championship 2015 / XDubai Flyboard World Cup 2014 / Flyboard World Cup 2013 / Flyboard World Cup 2012 / Japan Flyboard World Cup\n\nTraining: You can find training centres throughout the world where they will teach you how to learn the basic skills required for the sport of hydroflight. These centres usually cost quite a bit of money but that is to cover the cost of fuel, the cost of the instructor’s wage, the cost of hiring equipment (if you don’t already have your own) and sometimes to help cover the cost of the private lake that the company is using. Many training centres also operate straight off the beach or other coastal locations.\n\nIn Australia there is only one franchise that offer hydroflight training. The name of this company is Jetpack Adventures. They have training centres in the following cities around Australia; Gold Coast, Sydney, Sunshine Coast, Whitsundays, Central Coast and Perth. These centres are placed at locations such as regatta centres, inland canals and even a giant man made pool. The beach is often a tricky place to try teach beginners because of tides and currents that come into effect. Jetpack adventures is a growing company that performs stunt shows all around Australia at different events such as the V8 Supercars GC 600, Defqon dance festival, Redcliffe Kite Festival and many other events but they have even hosted the Go Pro Athlete Summit.\n\nInjuries are a major factor when it comes to hydroflight sports especially when the pilot starts to perform advanced movements. Injuries can occur at absolutely any time of your flight. \n• Hitting the pressurized hose at speed can cause concussion, bruising and even broken toes / ankles / legs. \n• Diving into the water presents the danger of breaking your neck, concussion, dislocation of shoulders / back or neck, and if the pilot attempts to scoop the trajectory of the dive underwater against his current rotation he will be at serious risk of a back injury.\n• Hitting the water flat (non-diving position) from a height of 10 meters will bring the pilot to a stop in less than 1 foot which can cause serious bruising to your body and internal organs, it also strains the connective tissue securing the organs and possible minor haemorrhaging of lungs and other tissue is also possible.\n• According to the website Hyper Physics (impact force of falling object generator), if a fully kitted up pilot with the weight of 75 kg fell from a full height of 16 meters (without the help of forward momentum or the force of the jets pushing them) he would hit the water at approximately 63 km/h. Yet most professionals weigh between 75 – 90 kg once fully kitted up.\n• Whilst performing manoeuvres such as back flips or front flips the pilot can reach up to 4 Gs of force.\n\nThe hydroflight industry is full of hazards and potential for things to go wrong. Here is a list of things that pilots must keep their eyes peeled for whilst operating a device.\n• Rocks and other submerged objects can be a very dangerous hazard for all hydroflight participants. Before diving under the water it is best to have a good understanding of what lies beneath the surface and the depth of the water. \n• Water depth is another critical element to the sport of hydroflight. If the pilot is operating only 1–3 meters above the water, then they should have at least 2 meters of depth below them. If the pilot exceeds 3 meters, then the water depth must now be at a depth of 4 meters.\n• Objects above the water can be as equally as dangerous as any other submerged objects. Whilst flying in the air a pilot must keep on the lookout for any 3D objects such as bridges, buoys, boats, jetties, other hydroflight pilots and the hose and jet ski that they’re attached to.\n• Dolphin dives is a fantastic manoeuvre that is usually performed more on the jet-boards. Although it looks spectacular it holds a great danger because the pilot is diving head first into the water from any height between 1–15 meters. Whilst performing this manoeuvre it is essential to know how to execute it perfectly and also to have the knowledge of what lies beneath the surface and how much water depth you have to work with.\n• Knee knockouts are the most common of injuries when it comes to advanced manoeuvres. If the pilot bends his knees and goes into a squat position whilst the board is lifting them up with high power, there is a good chance the knee will make contact with the face.\n• Weather and tides can be hazardous to any pilot no matter their skill level. Tides and currents can play a big factor because if the tide goes out it may take away the valuable water depth that is needed to maintain your safety. If the current is creating rips on the beach, then the pilot can easily drift out of his designated zone or float out to sea if they’re not concentrating. If storms approach it is best to exit the water because there are many electricity conducting components in the jet skis and hydroflight devices that could end up giving you a nasty shock if lighting gets too close.\n• Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning can be hazardous to your health and even cause death. To ensure safety you must never get to close to the back of the jet ski where these fumes are released whilst the engine is turned on.\n• Flotation equipment is essential. Always ensure that your PFD has a rating of level 3 and that your chosen hydroflight devices flotation is still buoyant.\n• Not only should their always be someone observing your flight from the jet ski but for extra safety you should also have another on the beach. Always discuss and arrange your hand signals so that all participants are on the same page before starting.\n\nThe World Hydroflight Association (WHFA) is a worldwide organization representing, hydroflight participants, manufacturers, companies and fans. It exists to promote the sport of hydroflight via the safe, responsible operation of hydroflight devices.\n\nhttp://www.h2romagazine.com/hydroflight-sports\nhttp://worldhydroflightassociation.org/\nhttp://www.h2romagazine.com/hydroflight-competitions\nhttp://www.x-jetpacks.com/safety-first/\nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/flobi.html\n"}

{"id": "35739787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35739787", "title": "Maya Ballgame", "text": "Maya Ballgame\n\nMaya Ballgame, which is a branch of the Mesoamerican Ballgame, is an sport event that was played throughout the Maya civilization. The Maya civilization was spread out throughout much of Central America. One of the common links of the Mayan culture of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Belize is the game played with a rubber ball, about which we have learned from several sources. Maya ballgame was played with big stone courts. The ball court itself was a focal point of Maya cities and symbolized the city’s wealth and power. The playing arena was in the shape of an I with high platforms on either side of the court allowing for large numbers of spectators. Portable stone court markers known as \"hacha\" usually depicting animals or skulls were placed around the arena. The game was played for 2 weeks.\n\nThe Maya ball game originated more than 3,000 years ago. The Popol Vuh describes the history of the K'iche' people and their rulers and mentions the important position of the Maya ballgame. Through this ball game, a conflict of the forces of darkness and light is described and enacted. By tradition, the twin brothers, Hun Hunaphu and Xbalanque, used their time on earth to play ball. Through the noise of the game, the anger of Vucub Came, the master of the underworld, was aroused. A fight ensued, from which resulted in the formation of the MBG. After the game, one of the brothers was decapitated and his head was used as the game ball. From the decapitated trunk of the player, blood escaped in the form of snakes. This blood was taken as a symbol of fertility. This scene is depicted in reliefs on the walls of MBG courts, such as the most famous example in Chichen Itza in Mexico.\n\nIn the highlands of Chiapas and of Guatemala alone, 300 MBG courts have been found. Of these, 85% have been dated in the post-classic period. Only two early classic courts have been reported and these are at Palenque and Copan.\n\nMurals depicting captives, warriors, Creation myths, and transfers of political power from one ruler to another were painted around the ball court.\n\nThe ballcourt in Cerros is contemporary and date to the Tulix ceramic phase(100BC-100AD). Both are similar in date to the other major public structures. Both courts at Cerros are oriented N-S and orient to the N-S medial axis of a pyramid. They are also oriented with the W axis of another pyramid, and its associated plaza, appears to interesect the medial axis of the site of the site at a point approximately equidistant from either court.\n\nThe Maya ballgame was more than just an athletic event. It was also a sacrificial and religious event. The Maya believed that it was necessary to play the game for their own survival. The ballgame provided an opportunity to show devoutness to the gods by sacrificing captured kings and high lords, or the losing opponents of the game.\n\nThirteen Rabbit's ritual sacrifice shows death by decapitation and disembowelment. Looking at sculptural portrayals this was most likely the standard technique used at El Tajin. As trophy heads were popular in Mayan Culture, it follows that they were important in ballgame. Some death heads occurred as figurines; so sacred were the small sculptures that they were preserved and appear as offerings at non-elite burials in Late Classic domestic interments. As stated earlier, decapitation was used as sacrifice at El Tajin. By looking at sculptures at other ballcourts decapitation was also used at Aparicio, Veracruz, and Chichen Itza, Yucatan. Severing of the head is also seen in the Popol Vuh. Some sources say the winning team's captain was decapitated, and at Chichen ìtza you can barely see that a squash and a couple of snakes representing Kuklkan popped out of the sacrificed captains head. This was an honor and the captain would have to accept a drink or food item.\n\nThe rules seem to have changed over the centuries. Certainly two teams played against each other. The number of players varied between 2 and 6 players per team. Sometimes, an additional person is seen in the illustrations, who is believed to be a referee. The ball was put in motion by action of the right hip, the right elbow and the right knee and was not permitted to touch the ground. It could be passed from person to person in each team by propulsion by one of the above body parts. The aim was to move the ball back to the opposite team, preferably through the ring. The goal of the opposition (what today might be termed ‘the defense’) was to force the offense to lose control and to allow the ball to touch the ground. The stone ring was an innovation of the late-classic and early post-classic periods, as seen in Chichen Itza and in Uxmal. Playing the ball off the border wall could intensify the game. The ricochet of the ball could hardly be anticipated, especially if the walls were uneven.\n\nA rubber ball was always used. Its size and weight varied over the centuries. Most historians assume a weight of 3–4 kg and a size of a skittle ball. The existence of a caoutchouc tree was necessary to produce the ball. These trees were found in the tropical regions in the Maya territories.\n\nThe usual dress for MBG players is known from iconographic and figural findings. These show leather protection mainly at the hips and the chest, but sometimes also at the knees and the arms, though very seldom at the feet. The clothing was used to protect against the impact of the ball. The protected parts of the body were used to strike the ball. Some players would wear head dresses (like deer heads) for ritual reasons.\n\nVariations in the MBG occurred over the centuries as they have in modern ball games over years of use. Despite the variations, it would appear that the physical loads of MBG were most similar to those of soccer-tennis. Most likely the players of ballgame manifested a heart rate and blood pressure responses consistent with physical loads of light/moderate intensity, in the range of 4.5–5.5 METs. Thus, the cardiovascular demands of popular sports seem to have remained relatively similar through several millennia.\n"}

In the United States, Micro's products are sold under the brand \"Micro Kickboard\" for trademark reasons. The company holds several patents for its products.\n\nWim Ouboter, born in 1960 invented the kickscooter out of laziness. He states, that the way from his apartement to his favorite restaurant was too far to go by foot and yet too close to use a bike. He then invented a foldable, two-wheeled Scooter for those kind of distances that could easily be folded anytime and placed in a backpack. He pitched his idea to Smart and they were willing to put one Scooter in every single car. Ouboter then tried to find a manufacturer for his innovation, but soon realized that Europe simply was too expensive. In Taiwan he could convince the owner of a factory to produce the Scooter, also because he had proof that Smart liked his idea. Just before the production could start Smart failed the moose test and so the project was put on hold, since Smart had to solve that problem.\n\nBut Ouboter had another idea: a three-wheeled Scooter, called the Kickboard. He teamed up with K2 and presented his idea at the International Sports Fair (ISPO) in Munich in 1998 very successfully. With the earned money he founded Micro Mobility Systems in 1999 and started producing the two-wheeled Scooter, which was an even bigger success. Because of the excessive demand, he allowed his partner in Taiwan to distribute the Scooter in the United States with the name Razor for a commission. After having sold about one million Scooters in 2000, the sales decreased rapidly in 2001.\n\nIn the subsequent years, the company continued to invent new products, designed for urban mobility, like the Mini Micro for kids, the Scooter Luggage or the electric emicro one. In addition, Micro has teamed up with other brands, like Peugeot, Suitsupply or Vibram to name a few. Many celebrities and their kids, like David Beckham and his children, Alessandra Ambrosio or Hugh Jackman have been spotted riding a micro scooter.\n\nWith Micro Xtreme the brand also went into Freestyle Sports and works closely with professional Athletes like Benjamin Friant. After the huge success in 2000 and the rapid downfall in 2001, Micro has grown organically with a gross revenue in 2014 of 60 Million Swiss Francs. With the development of the company, manufacturing capacities shifted to RazorUSA in California. The evolution of Micro into a lifestyle brand that invents mobility solutions for children, teenagers and adults was honoured by Ernest and Young in 2015, when Wim Ouboter was nominated as Entrepreneur of the Year.\n\nThe Microlino was first presented in 2016 at the Geneva Car Show. Based on the design of the Isetta, a 1950s bubble car which was sold over 160,000 vehicles, the new design has a battery powered electric motor. The two-seat small car is designed for urban mobility with a top speed of , a range of and can be charged from a domestic power outlet. The car is expected to be on the market by the end of 2018 with an estimated price of 12,000 Euro and initial sales limited to Germany and Switzerland..

It is home to the UTEP Miners of Conference USA, and the late December college football bowl game, the Sun Bowl. The stadium opened in 1963 and has a current seating capacity of 51,500.\n\nThe stadium, named for the game it hosts, was opened in September 1963 with a Texas Western win over North Texas State. The opening play was a 54-yard touchdown run by Larry Durham of the Miners.\n\nThe land on which the stadium sits was originally donated by the university to El Paso County, who built the stadium for the school and the Sun Bowl game. Both had previously used the school's current track and field venue, which seats 15,000. The city had realized that the game could not expand its audience or the list of teams that it could invite without a bigger stadium, so the Sun Bowl was built in a natural bowl adjacent to the west. It originally sat 30,000, with only the sideline grandstands. The playing field runs nearly north–south (tilted about at an elevation of above sea level.\n\nThe current press box was added in 1969, and the stadium reached the capacity of 52,000 in 1982 with the addition of the north end zone stands and the expansion of the east stands. (The south end zone is still vacant, with the ground of the bowl covered with the school's logos.)\n\nThe school retook control of the land and stadium in 2001, when hundreds of seats were removed as part of a re-configuration of the seating bowl to accommodate soccer, which lowered capacity to its current figure of 51,500.\n\nThe school's Athletics Director, Jim Senter, announced on April 13, 2018 plans to renovate the Sun Bowl Stadium. The $15 million dollar project would include luxury boxes installed in a new press facility, renovation of the concourses and premium seating added on the west side of the stadium. The renovations are projected to be completed in a 16-month timespan.\n\nThe college football bowl game began in January 1936 and moved to the new stadium in December 1963. All games have been played in El Paso.\n\nOn February 2, 2007, the stadium hosted the inaugural Texas vs. The Nation all-star college football game; the Nation defeated Texas \n\nThe Sun Bowl is also a venue for music and other large public events, having hosted concerts by U2, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, and Kenny Chesney.\n\nOn February 17, 2016, the stadium hosted festivities and a simulcast of the Mass held by Pope Francis during the pontiff's visit to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, several miles away across the Rio Grande.\n\nFor a short time before moving to Dudley Field, it was the home to PDL franchise, the El Paso Patriots. They now play at Patriot Stadium.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2927661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2927661", "title": "Vicarage Road", "text": "Vicarage Road\n\nVicarage Road, a stadium in Watford, Hertfordshire, England, is the home of the football club Watford of the Premier League. An all-seater stadium, its current capacity is 23,700 following the completion of the new Sir Elton John Stand in 2014, and expansion work in 2015 and again throughout 2016 and 2017; this included expansion of the football pitch.\n\nIt has been the home of Watford since 1922, when the club moved from Cassio Road. The ground was officially opened by Col. Charles Healey of Benskins Brewery for the visit of Millwall on 30 August 1922. In addition to being Watford's home since opening, the stadium was also home to Wealdstone F.C. between 1991 and 1993, and to rugby union side Saracens from 1997 until they moved to their new home at Allianz Park in February 2013.\n\nAfter purchasing the freehold of the stadium from Benskins in January 2002, Watford's financial situation forced them to sell and lease back the stadium later that year. However, after a campaign entitled 'Let's Buy Back The Vic' with donations coming from fans, as well as celebrity former owner Elton John donating the entire proceeds of a concert held at the venue, the club was able to repurchase the stadium in September 2004.\n\nOn 1 September 2011 it hosted England under-21s 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 8 match against Azerbaijan under-21s. The hosts thrashed the visitors 6 – 0 with braces from Craig Dawson and Henri Lansbury and single goals from Jordan Henderson and Martyn Waghorn. There were 7,738 in attendance.\n\nThe Vicarage Road Stand was built following the conclusion of the 1992–93 season. Previously an open terrace, the all-seater stand was built to comply with the Taylor Report and raise the standard of the ground. It cost £2.3 million to build and had a capacity of 5,800 people. Construction was largely funded by the £1.2m sale of Bruce Dyer in 1994.\n\nOriginally a mere earth bank when the club moved to the ground, it was gradually transformed into a conventional terrace. In 1978, an electronic scoreboard was put up, which became an iconic symbol of Watford's eighties heyday. In a display of solidarity with the home support, Graham Taylor maintained that the benches for the coaching staff and substitute on the side of the pitch would remain exposed to the elements until such time as the home end was covered.\n\nIts final game as a terrace was a 1–0 loss to Oxford United on 8 May 1993. It opened to the public once more on 18 September 1993, with Watford defeating Notts County 3–1.\n\nPreviously the home stand, it now houses the away support. A partition was subsequently added, meaning that both home and away support could be put in the stand. Half of the stand is given to away fans, and the other half is used as the family area for home fans. It also houses wheelchair supporters of both teams. Since August 2012, the stand has been home to the Hornets Shop\n\nThe Rookery Stand was built over the course of the 1994–95 season. Another former terrace, the all-seater Rookery stand has a capacity of 6,960. Larger than the Vicarage Road stand, it has facilities on two levels and also holds most of the club's administrative areas. The stand cost £1.6 million to build, approximately £300,000 of this figure was contributed by the Football Trust, with the remaining money coming from the £2.3m sale of Paul Furlong by then-owner Jack Petchey in 1994.\n\nWhen Watford moved from Cassio Road, this end of the ground featured a roof over a cinder bank, and over the years the roof eventually had to be removed for safety reasons. The Supporters' Club eventually raised funds to enable the Rookery End to feature concrete terracing under cover, and this aim was realised in 1959.\n\nThe new stand, replacing the 1959 model was used by Watford supporters for the first time on 22 April 1995, for the visit of Bristol City. As part of redevelopment work in conjunction with the Watford Health Campus, 164 units of affordable housing, known locally as \"The Wrap\", were built on and around the Rookery end. Construction finished in 2009.\n\nThe Rookery is the \"home end\". It lends its name to the Watford fans' podcast, \"From The Rookery End\". The stand was known as the \"Rover South\" for Saracens matches.\n\nThe Graham Taylor Stand was renamed for the 2014–15 season, taking its name from the club's most successful manager Graham Taylor. It was previously named after former FIFA president Sir Stanley Rous. The official renaming ceremony took place on 29 November 2014.\n\nThe stand with its distinctive wavy roof runs along the side of the pitch, on the west side of the ground. It is a two-tiered stand, with executive boxes and a TV camera gantry. Built in 1986, it replaced the Shrodells Stand. The £3 million development was partly funded via a loan from Elton John. The upper tier, complete with executive boxes, was constructed first, and temporary seats forming a lower-tier were added later. These were later replaced with permanent seats, first used for a game against Notts County on 18 September 1993.\n\nWhen the club moved from Cassio Road in 1922, the Union Stand was transported and reconstructed on this side of the ground. It was replaced by the Shrodells Stand, which was constructed during the 1930s. It was extended in 1979 with a further 2,200 seats replacing the standing enclosure in front of the stand.\n\nThe final match for the Shrodells Stand was a 1–1 draw against Manchester United on 3 May 1986, the Graham Taylor Stand opened on 23 August 1986, when Oxford United visited Vicarage Road, with Watford coming out 3–0 winners.\n\nThe Sir Elton John Stand sits on the east side of the ground, and contains the changing rooms & tunnel. The stand was fully opened on 13 December 2014, in a ceremony attended by Sir Elton John.\n\nPrior to the development of the Sir Elton John Stand, the east side of the ground was home to the Main Stand, which was constructed in 1922 following Watford FC's move from Cassio Road. The Main Stand was closed in 2008 due to safety concerns.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Watford FC by the Pozzo family in 2012, the club were able to finance the development of a new stand to replace the Main Stand. The redevelopment of the east side of the stadium began in 2013, with the aim of developing a 3,000 seater capacity stand which would also house the players changing rooms, television gantry and tunnel.\n\nIn May 2014, it was announced the stand will be known as The Watford FC Community Stand. However the club announced in November 2014 that the new stand would instead be named after former chairman Sir Elton John. The changing rooms were used for the first time in a friendly match between Watford and Udinese on 2 August 2014.\n\nOn 8 June 2015, the club confirmed that 700 extra seats were being installed in the recently built Sir Elton John Stand. This number was revised a day later to around 1000 extra seats, following the announcement of an expansion in the north-east corner.\n\nThe first game under floodlights at Vicarage Road was played in 1953, when lights were installed on top of the Main Stand. These were replaced in 1960, with four pylons being built in the corners of the ground. Currently the floodlights are mounted on the top of the Vicarage Road and Rookery Stands. New LED floodlights have been added for the 2015/16 season including lights on the top of the Sir Elton John and Graham Taylor stands.\n\nIn 1982, Vicarage Road Stadium gained its own railway station, . It was introduced as a means of managing the crowds attending football matches, providing an alternative to and , and was only open on match days. Development of the station was funded jointly by the Football Trust, Watford Borough Council, Watford F.C. and British Rail. The station was officially opened on 4 December 1982 by Elton John and Lord Aberdare, chairman of the Football Trust. The inaugural train rolled into the station five minutes late, bringing away fans of Manchester United to Vicarage Road; the match that day ended with a 1–0 defeat for Watford.\n\nThe station fell out of use when British Rail closed the railway line in 1996 and has remained derelict ever since. A new London Underground station, , is due to open in 2020 on the opposite side of the Vicarage Road bridge as part of the Croxley Rail Link project to extend the Metropolitan line to Watford Junction. However since March 2017 the project has been in doubt due to a significant shortfall in funding.\n\nGreyhound racing initially began at Vicarage Road on 20 October 1928. The racing was held under National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) rules and as many as four race nights per week were held every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 7.45pm. However the provisional NGRC licence was cancelled as early as 1 November 1928, forcing the track to race independently (unaffiliated to a governing body).\n\nThe racing would continue for many years alongside the football team and was still active for the next forty years before a temporary closure on 28 June 1969. On 14 October 1974 racing returned under NGRC rules under the organisation of the industry’s leading promoter the Greyhound Racing Association. Derby winning trainer Barbara Tompkins was attached to the track and won the Buckinghamshire Cup at Slough Stadium in 1975 with Houghton Girl.\n\nThe shape of track was very sharp due to the nature of the bend design around the football pitch corners and this led to criticism within the industry that it was not safe enough. Despite this a Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) contract was established at the track. During 1977 the club announced plans to end the greyhound racing so that stadium improvements could go ahead. The final race meeting took place on 30 October 1978. The last winner was a greyhound called Chad Supreme.\n\n\n"}
