{"id": "1995610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995610", "title": "540 kick", "text": "540 kick\n\nIn martial arts and tricking, the 540 kick (Chinese:旋風腳 (\"Xuanfengjiao\")) (also known as inside turning kick, jump inside kick, and \"hyper\" tornado kick) is a jump kick move. It involves a rotation of approximately 540 degrees (although when performed correctly the performer has only done a spin of 360 degrees – not including whatever takeoff used).\n\nIt is practiced various disciplines including Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, Wushu, Shaolin Quan, Capoeira and some Karate styles but traditionally most associated with the Korean martial arts. However, the most prominent defining feature is that the same leg is used for taking off, kicking, and landing.The other leg is used to propel the performer into the air, and is then retracted before landing. Many martial arts tricksters choose this move as their first move to attempt.\n\nThis move has a history in ballet as well, where it is performed as an advanced variation of a 'barrel roll'. Principal male ballet dancers include the move in their variation (solo) as a crowd-pleasing feat of excellence. The move and a variation of it, the reverse 540, has been present in ballet for quite some time now, and is used commonly by dancers such as Daniil Simkin, Tetsuya Kumakawa and Joseph Phillips. This move has been recently introduced into the world of professional wrestling, where it is commonly referred to as a \"jumping corkscrew roundhouse kick\".\n\nLike most variations of martial arts kicks, the name of the kick is normally determined by the position of the foot, degree of rotation and positioning of the hips, and any additional kicks that may be added during the execution:\n\nA jump turning kick that mimics the 540. The practitioner, already facing he target, jumps up to perform an inside crescent or roundhouse kick, and tucks the other to then land on the kicking foot. This motion does not share the full take off pattern of a true 540.\n\nThis variation of the kick is typically found in wushu. The kick is executed as a crescent kick, meaning that the toes are pointed forewards with the hips facing the target. If aiming for a target, the target would be hit with the inside of the foot (from the heel to the big toe).\n\nThis version rotates the hips about 90° more than a crescent before executing the kick. The kick is executed as a roundhouse kick meaning that a target would be hit with the top of the foot or ankle to avoid breaking the toes. It is also called a Bolley Kick by some in TaeKwonDo, and was popularized in the mid-eighties by George Chung and Steven Ho in open martial art competitions. In TaeKwonDo, a tricking \"540\" kick refers to this 540 roundhouse, rather than the TaeKwonDo 540 hook kick.\n\nThe take off of this is like a 1-over 360 kick. If back on your right foot, throw it forward counterclockwise, tuck it and push off with your right. Jump up and complete 360 with an outside, counterclockwise crescent kick and land on the same foot. Look at the reverse image of a 540 and you can see it.\n\nAlso referred to as simply a \"Lazyboy\", this version is identical to a typical 540 from a technical standpoint. The defining characteristic is that the hands are placed on the back or top of the head. This pose is to simulate the image of a person relaxing or lying down. While struck in the air, this variation is performed to show the ease in which they can perform the trick, demonstrating that they don't need the momentum of the arms to complete the trick, and/or to add style to the trick. This trick is also known as the \"Playboy 540\" for its extravagance and confident posture such of a playboy.\n\nThis is performed with a take off from both legs and executed with an inside crescent kick.\n\nThough, the body mechanics/technique is different, the Sideswipe and 540 are categorized together because they both use the same leg to take off, kick, and land. This version is similar to a standard 540 kick, but the body is spinning parallel to the ground and can be performed almost inverted. After the non-kicking leg is thrown up in the take-off, the body is leaned back so it is spinning at least horizontally. This kick has less practical use due to the higher levels of agility required.\n\nAlso called a \"Cheat 720\" or a \"540 Wheel,\" the 540 hook uses the same takeoff as mentioned previously. However, instead of using the jumping leg to kick, the performer spins around another 180 degrees and performs a hook kick or outside crescent kick with the other leg, depending on the position of the foot. This kick is one of the variations that actually spins a full 540°. A TaeKwonDo \"540\" refers to this kick.\n\nIn this move, the user will execute a 540 crescent/roundhouse kick but instead of landing immediately on the kicking leg, the kicker will rotate an additional 360 degrees mid-air before landing. It is rather uncommon in the tricking community due to its difficulty, but is present in martial arts disciplines. It is most prevalent in Wushu.\n\nThe traditional 540 can be landed into the splits by sending the kicking leg backwards after the kick as been executed and extending the other leg forward during the landing. Theoretically, almost every trick can be landed in the splits, however, landing some of the more advanced versions of tricks like this would require extra height in the jump, extra rotation of the body, and a very keen sense of timing and spatial awareness.\n\nSome variants of the 540 include multiple kicks being executed while in the air. Some of those variations are:\n\nNot to be confused with the 540 crescent, a crescent 540 is where a crescent kick is thrown out with the first leg before the regular 540 kick is thrown with the other. Both of these kicks are executed mid-air. A variation of this is where the first crescent kick is thrown as a twisted front kick, followed by a round house kick. For this the hips must be rotated more before the kicks are thrown, allowing the feet to be turned towards the targets.\n\nThis is similar to a crescent 540 in that there are two kicks executed in sequence, however the 540 kick (either crescent or roundhouse) is thrown out first. Immediately following the first kick, the other leg comes around to execute a heel kick after rotating an additional 180 degrees. The mechanics to this variant are almost identical to a 540-wheel or cheat 720. Proper execution of this involves performing a roundhouse kick instead of an inside crescent kick, with the hips turned over and toes pointed. In doing so, after the first kick is completed, the kicker's hips and body are in a better position to spin around and snap out the hook.\n\nThis is the combination of a crescent 540 and a jacknife, essentially executing three separate kicks during the same motion. One with the landing leg and two with the other. The kicks and their execution are similar to those of a 720 triple. This move is commonly performed in TaeKwonDo demonstrations.\n\n\n"}

The Uptown-area stadium hosts the Charlotte Knights, a Triple-A Minor League Baseball team in the International League. It is also the third sports building to be built in Uptown, after Bank of America Stadium (home of the NFL's Carolina Panthers) and Spectrum Center (home of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets).\n\nAn Uptown stadium for the Knights had been a long-running saga in Charlotte, occasionally the subject of contentious debate. Since the dawn of the new millennium, the Knights had consistently had the worst attendance in the International League. Their stadium at the time, Knights Stadium, was located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, 30 minutes south of Uptown Charlotte. Many fans were unwilling to brave the traffic on Interstate 77 to get there.\n\nThe project had been repeatedly blocked by Jerry Reese, a Charlotte lawyer who claimed the land swap was illegal. Reese had ambitions to move a Major League Baseball team to Charlotte and viewed a Triple-A sized stadium for the Knights as a detriment.\n\nIn August 2006 the stadium became the source of more debate, as Mecklenburg County commission chairman Parks Helms said he would stall an arts project until the Charlotte City Council looked at a proposal he backed to bring baseball to Uptown.\n\nFurthermore, it could expand the Atlantic Coast Conference's plans to return the Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournament to Charlotte. The ACC tournament had been held at Knights Stadium until the NCAA's ban on South Carolina having predetermined championships took effect because of NAACP pressure in relation to the boycott of the state by the organization.\n\nMultiple new mid-rise hotels are expected to open in the area around the new stadium, along with restaurants and retail.\n\nThe first event held at the ballpark was a media softball game, which took place on March 22, 2014. The first Knights game took place on April 11, 2014.\n\nThe stadium hosted the 2016 Triple-A All-Star Game in which the International League All-Stars defeated the Pacific Coast League All-Stars, 4–2.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, Charlotte Knights Chief Operating Officer Dan Rajkowski announced that the Knights will host a total of six college baseball games this season during the Sunbelt Rentals Collegiate Baseball Series. This is the most in BB&T Ballpark history.\n\nOn April 23, 2012, it was announced that BB&T acquired the naming rights for the new ballpark. The terms of the deal were undisclosed and the ballpark will be officially referred to as BB&T Ballpark indefinitely.\n\nThe stadium features a two-level club with skyline views as well as a VIP, climate-controlled club with full service bar. In total, there are 975 club seats and 22 luxury suites at the ballpark.\n\nIt is thought to be slightly friendlier to hitters than typical minor-league parks. Knights general manager Scotty Smith said that due to the limited lot size, the foul lines are a few feet shorter than minor-league guidelines.\n\n"}

A checked swing occurs when a batter starts to swing his bat at the ball, but stops the swing in order to allow the ball to pass without hitting it. If the swing was indeed checked, so that there was no swing, then if the bat did not touch the ball and if the ball did not go through the strike zone, the pitch counts as a ball; but in that circumstance if the swing was not checked, so that a swing occurred, then the pitch counts as a strike.\n\nInitially, the home plate umpire must determine if a swing was checked or not checked. If he indicates that it was checked, an appeal can be made by the catcher or his manager, and the home plate umpire can then make a request to either the 1st or 3rd base umpire to make the call as to whether the swing was indeed checked. (To maximize visibility, the 1st base umpire makes the call for right-handed batters, and the 3rd base umpire for left-handed batters.) To indicate a checked swing, the umpire will make a “safe” gesture with his hands; to indicate a full swing, he will clench his fist.\n\nIf a ball that passes the batter goes through the strike zone, it is a strike even if a swing is checked. A checked swing sometimes results in an unintentional swinging bunt, where the ball hits the bat and rolls a short distance, although the batter apparently stopped his swing. If a ball is hit during a checked swing, it is in play as long as it is not ruled a foul ball.\n\nThe Major League Baseball rulebook does not contain an official definition for a checked swing, but defines a swing as \"an attempt to strike at the ball.\" It is the decision of the umpire as to whether an attempt was made or not. Generally, factors such as whether the bat passes the front of the plate or the batter pulls his wrists back are considered in the ruling. Some umpires prefer to use the \"breaking the wrists\" criterion as the method to decide a checked swing: if the wrists \"rolled over\", a swing occurred.\n\nCheck-swinging can also be used in some warm-up exercises, such as the game pepper.\n\n"}

Also known as the Jr dragster, it reaches speeds of up to 85 mph. The cars were developed in New Zealand in 1988, with classes developed by the New Zealand Hot Rod Association . The NHRA began sanctioning the class in 1991, with the JDRL (Junior Drag Racing League). The JDRL is a division of the NHRA, which consists of two different dragster classes, traditional Jr. Dragster having a wheelbase between 90-150 inches and a single-cylinder, five brake horsepower Briggs & Stratton engine, and the larger Jr. Comp dragster being 150-190 inches in wheelbase and using a motorcycle or personal watercraft engine. Junior drag racers may choose to participate in programs run by the NHRA, IHRA, or at an unsanctioned facility. Drivers may be male or female and must be at least five years of age to test, and six years to compete, and be no older than 20 years on December 31 of the competition year (a driver who turns 18 on January 2 is permitted to race in the class until December 31 of the year in question). \n\nThe track is 1/8 of a mile, and depending on class, is contested as a bracket race or a heads-up start on a 5-tenths sportsman tree. Racers E.T (Elapsed Time) is determined by age. Drivers age 5 can only test in single-car passes, and can go no faster than 20.00 seconds. Drivers age 6-7 can go no faster than 13.90 (and must start heads-up), and can officially compete in full competition. Drivers age 5-7 must use a crate engine from Briggs & Stratton with a slide valve to reduce power. Drivers age 8-9 can go no faster than 11.90, 10- to 12-year-olds are limited to 8.90 and 13- to 17-year-olds can go up to 7.90 at 85 mph. Drivers 14-20 can race in Jr. Comp, where racers are limited to 6.900 at 109.99 MPH. Drivers who are 9 as of January 1 can participate in either the 8-9 or 10-12 category once they turn 10 during the year, and drivers who are 12 as of January 1 can participate in the 10-12 or 13-17 category once they turn 13 during the year. Drivers who turn 14 may run in Jr. Comp. A driver who turns 18 during the year may stay in Jr. Dragster before jumping to either the adult classes or Jr. Comp. \n\nJr.Dragsters also compete in a different racing class called 'Outlaw'. This class is run to the 330 ft cone of the racing surface. The class runs heads-up on a 4-tenths pro tree. Usually this class is a qualified field, so the teams have to give it all they can just to make the field. While different series rules vary, the main principle is the same. The different series restrict engine combinations and weight packages so that the cars do not exceed the 4.10 time NHRA says is the fastest junior dragsters can run to the 330 ft. legally.\nRacers compete almost every weekend, running in points series at their home tracks, or in various specialty events with big prizes. During the course of the year, racers could also attend various division events, or Nationals. In the NHRA, racers choose between attending the Eastern, and the Western Conference Finals. In the UK there are over thirty racers and still growing. Though Bracket racing is still the main factor of Jr. drag racing, varieties of heads up racing are also a growing part of this sport. The next step up for Jr. Dragster is Jr. Comp, and then moving into the full size cars.\n\n"}

It is based in the Urbis building in Manchester city centre, and preserves, conserves and displays important collections of football memorabilia. As a publicly funded national museum, entrance is free.\n\nThe museum was originally based in Deepdale, Preston, Lancashire, but moved to Manchester in 2012.\n\nThe idea for what became the National Football Museum goes back to 1994 when Baxi Partnership, a local company, acquired Preston North End Football Club (PNE) and began the redevelopment of Deepdale Stadium. A chance conversation between Bryan Gray, Chairman of PNE, and the Football League, led to a meeting with Harry Langton, the man who over thirty years put together what is now called the FIFA Museum Collection. FIFA recognised the importance of the collection and acquired it from Harry Langton with a view to finding a permanent home. FIFA saw the proposed museum at Preston as an ideal permanent location for the FIFA Museum Collection.\n\nBryan Gray formed a small team of people to work on the project including Keith Cooper of FIFA, David Fleming, Director of Tyne and Wear Museums, Brian Booth, formerly Vice Chancellor of the University of Central Lancashire, and Chris Newbery, director of the Royal Marines Museum in Portsmouth. The Football Association was represented by David Davies. The National Football Museum was incorporated as a private limited company in June 1995 and became a registered charity in November 1995.\n\nAfter much hard work, an application to the Heritage Lottery Fund was successful and a grant of £7.5m was awarded in November 1997. The total project cost was estimated at £12m. A ground breaking ceremony took place on 26 September 1998 by Sepp Blatter of FIFA with the Rt Hon Chris Smith in attendance. The foundation stone was laid by Bryan Gray and Ben Casey (who had persuaded Baxi to buy PNE) in April 2000. Finally the National Football Museum was officially opened on 21 June 2001 by HRH The Duke of Kent. Bryan Gray, the founding chairman of trustees, stood down in September 2001 to be succeeded by Brian Booth.\n\nRob Pratten was the first employee of the Football Museum: he joined the team in May 1995 and for some time was the only employee. Kevin Moore was appointed Director in August 1997 and was later joined by Mark Bushell, Hugh Hornby and Lindsey Jones. The museum's first site was outside Deepdale, Preston, Lancashire. Deepdale was particularly significant as it is the oldest continuously used football league ground in the world. The museum's president is World Cup winner Sir Bobby Charlton.\n\nIn 2003 the museum and the University of Central Lancashire established the International Football Institute to conduct research into historical, social and cultural aspects of football.\n\nOn a visit in 2004, Sepp Blatter, President of FIFA commented \"\"The National Football Museum merits my admiration as a footballer and as the President of FIFA — it is a superb realisation, a real jewel!\". Sir Bobby Charlton commented that he \"“can’t think of a better museum anywhere in the world.”\" and Sir Alex Ferguson \"Each time I visit the Museum I am so impressed by the great job it does in bringing the rich history of football to life\"\". The museum received the award of Large Visitor Attraction of the Year, at the 2005 Lancashire and Blackpool Tourism Awards\n\nIn December 2008, chairman of the Football League, Brian Mawhinney caused controversy when he suggested that the Museum should be moved from Preston to Wembley Stadium in order to attract more visitors.\nFounder Kevin Moore, stated that it had been an aim to have an exhibition at Wembley, but stated that the trustee's policy was to have its headquarters in Preston.\n\nDespite critical acclaim and attracting 100,000 visitors per year, funding was repeatedly an issue. In 2007, it had an income of £791,256 against out-goings of £1,231,195. The trustees were concerned about the museum's long-term future. In 2009, they approached Manchester City Council about moving the museum. The city council offered a funding package worth £2m per year for the museum to move to Manchester. Despite an improved offer of £400,000 per year from Preston and Lancashire councils, the trustees voted to move the museum to the Urbis exhibition centre in Manchester.\n\nIt was intended that subject to satisfactory funding, the Preston site would remain open as a secondary centre. However, the museum failed to agree a funding package with Lancashire County Council and the Preston site closed to the public at the end of April 2010. As of 2012, the Preston site is still used as a research and storage centre.\n\nUrbis closed in February 2010 in preparation for an intended opening of the new National Football Museum in summer 2011.\n\nThe museum reopened in Manchester on 6 July 2012. It is hoped that the new museum will attract 350,000 visitors per year. It was reported in August 2012 that the new National Football Museum attracted over 100,000 visitors in the first six weeks of opening. By the end of April 2013, the museum reached its 350,000 target.\n\nThe museum is based in the Urbis building and is laid out over 4 floors:\n\nLevel One – The largest floor, housing the zones:\nLevel Two – Featuring various paid-for football interactive games, as well the zones:\nLevel Three – A changing exhibition space. In summer 2016, it hosted an exhibition celebrating 50th anniversary of England's World Cup triumph.\nLevel Four – Learning and Education zone, currently featuring a small exhibition called \"Our Sporting Life\"\nLevel Five and Six – The Suite- Event Space (Previously a restaurant called 'Kaleido', which closed in 2013)\n\nLocated at the Deepdale stadium in Preston, where the museum was open from June 2001 – March 2010, the independent charity holds the following collections at its research facility:\n\nThe Neville Evans collection forms part of the largest private collection of football memorabilia in the world. Also known as the National Football Collection, it consists of a wide range of football-related items, including the largest private collection of Tottenham Hotspur memorabilia in the world. At least 400 items are on long-term loan to the National Football Museum, with other items also being supplied to complement their in house and travelling exhibits. Started by UK businessman Neville Evans, the collection continues to grow and works to preserve and share the history of football for the next generation of fans.\n\n\nAt any time, around 2,500 items from the museum’s collections are on display at its new home in Manchester city centre, with around a further 140,000 items held. Key items include\n\nMany exhibits are loaned to museums in the UK and artifacts have been loaned to exhibitions in Germany, Portugal, Switzerland and Belgium. The museum has worked in partnership with UEFA to create the UEFA Jubilee Exhibition, which opened in the European Parliament in Brussels, before moving to the National Football Museum. The museum also worked with UEFA to create the world’s first exhibition dedicated to women’s football, to coincide with the UEFA Euro 2005 Women’s Championship. To mark the 2006 FIFA World Cup the museum worked with partners to develop exhibitions in Hong Kong and Germany. A special exhibition \"Saved for the Nation: The Story of the FA Cup\" which featured the oldest surviving FA Cup trophy, used during FA Cup Finals between 1896 and 1910, was launched in May 2006. \n\nThe museum's temporary exhibitions programme has also included \"One for All: All for One\", a photographic exhibition highlighting the work of Philip Colvin, documenting the experiences and challenges of disabled Crystal Palace supporter Samuel Burch as he travelled across the country in support of his team); and \"The Greater Game: Football and The First World War\", exploring the role football played at home and at the front during the war years, and explores the myths and reality of famous stories from the conflict, including a previously unseen diary detailing the events of the famous Christmas Truce of 1914, as well as lost footage from the front and of wartime football.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Constructed in 1964 on the historic Ward Estate and originally called the Honolulu International Center, the center was renamed after Mayor of Honolulu Neal S. Blaisdell, who oversaw its construction. The multi-purpose complex is composed of an internationally renowned arena, concert hall, conference rooms, galleria and exhibition hall. It was remodeled and expanded in 1994. The complex is overseen by the City's Department of Enterprise Services which also oversees the Waikiki Shell. The City is seeking to redevelop the site with extensive stakeholder and public involvement to assess the community’s goals. Implementation of this plan will require significant investment by the City and its partners over the coming years, and the outcome will be an iconic symbol of the City and County of Honolulu.\n\nThe Neal S. Blaisdell Arena is a circular performance facility used for concerts and major sporting events. The arena can accommodate 7,700 seats for sports events, and up to 8,800 seats for stage events with seats set up on the arena floor.\n\nElvis Presley's \"Aloha from Hawaii\" concert was held here on January 14, 1973. In recognition of the concert, a bronze statue of Elvis was installed in 2007 outside the front of the arena. The statue was sponsored by the cable channel TV Land.\n\nOther events at the arena include WWE, Disney on Ice, American Idol Live!, Sesame Street Live, college basketball and volleyball, and international gymnastics, as well as a fundraising concert for victims of Hurricane Iniki, with Crosby, Stills & Nash, Jackson Browne & Bonnie Raitt, and a 1965 Billy Graham crusade.\n\nOther music artists that have performed at the arena include Mariah Carey, Metallica, Aerosmith, Van Halen, Bon Jovi, Elton John, Journey, Santana and Bruno Mars.\n\nDuring a circus performance in 1994, Tyke, an African Elephant, killed her trainer and charged out of the arena in rage. The animal rampaged outside the arena for 30 minutes before police fired 86 rounds at the elephant, who eventually collapsed and died as a result of the shootings.\n\nThe Philippine TV show ASAP performed at the Neal S. Blaisdell Arena on June 30, 2018 through an international concert titled ASAP Live in Honolulu.\n\nThe Arena also hosts the start of the exhibition season for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association and the men's and women's basketball and volleyball games for Hawaii Pacific University, the state's largest private university. It served as the home court for University of Hawaii at Mānoa basketball until UH built the Stan Sheriff Center on campus in 1994. The arena was the home venue for several short-lived attempts to establish Hawaii professional sports teams, including the Hawaii Volcanos of the Continental Basketball Association, the Hawaii Hurricanes of the American Basketball Association, the Hawaii Leis of World Team Tennis and three indoor football teams: the Honolulu Hurricanes, the Hawaii Hammerheads, and the af2's Hawaiian Islanders. The Leis and Islanders each persisted for three full seasons, the longest of all the pro teams based at the arena. In 1982, the arena served as home court for Chaminade University in a Christmas Eve upset of a Ralph Sampson-led number one ranked University of Virginia, 77-72.\n\nIn November 2006, the Professional Bull Riders hosted the Cheeseburger Island Style PBR Hawaii All-Star Challenge, a special event that took place between the 2006 PBR World Finals and the start of the 2007 PBR season.\n\nMany graduation and commencement ceremonies are held by schools in the arena and concert hall in late May and June.\n\nThe arena also hosts the WWE's flagship shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown LIVE\" for two nights, starts from June 25 to 26, 2018.\n\nWith a capacity of 2,158 seats, the Neal S. Blaisdell Concert Hall is the home of the Honolulu Symphony and the Hawaii Opera Theatre. Broadway productions such as \"The Phantom of the Opera\", \"Les Misérables\", \"Rent\", \"Miss Saigon\", \"Chicago\", \"Cats\", and other national touring shows have performed at the concert hall. In the fall and early winter of 2007 the concert hall was host to the Broadway musical \"The Lion King\", a booking which displaced the Honolulu Symphony from its usual home and led to a major cash flow crisis for the orchestra.\n\nLocated between the Concert Hall and the Arena, the Exhibition Hall provides of exhibition space on the main floor that is expandable to when combined with adjoining spaces. Five meeting rooms are also available in the hall. The Exhibition Hall accommodates numerous local trade and consumer shows and fundraising events throughout the year, and is one of the main exhibition venues in Honolulu in addition to the Hawaii Convention Center.\n\nThe Exhibition Hall hosts events throughout the year such as craft fairs, gun shows, family expos, job fairs, food & product shows, as well as private tradeshows.\n\nMany religious ceremonies have been performed in the Neal S. Blaisdell Center. The largest of which were the enthronement of Joseph Anthony Ferrario as the third Bishop of Honolulu and the ordination and installation of Clarence Richard Silva as the fifth Bishop of Honolulu, overseeing the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu. Kamehameha Schools has held their annual Song Contest at the Blaisdell since 1964. On December 23, 1982, what is considered by many as the greatest upset in sports history happened at the Blaisdell Arena as the then number 1-ranked University of Virginia Cavaliers, led by future Hall of Famer Ralph Sampson, were beaten 77-72 by Chaminade University, a small NAIA school (today NCAA Division II) with a student body of 800.\n\n"}

{"id": "5945062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5945062", "title": "One percenter (Australian rules football)", "text": "One percenter (Australian rules football)\n\nA one percenter (1%er) is a statistic kept in Australian rules football, and relates to a variety of actions which benefit the team, but are infrequent or defensive.\n\nIt has been standard for a long time for a coach to tell his team to \"keep doing the one percenters,\" and this essentially meant that players should keep applying pressure on opponents, by doing the little extra efforts which make turnovers more likely. They have always been seen as the \"little extra effort\" which went unrewarded on the statistics, and they received the name \"one percenter\" to represent this. They may not individually affect the outcome of the game, but collectively they can, hence they are regarded as a percentage of the overall performance of the team. Coaches have always liked to see their teams put in the effort and get plenty of one percenters, and the captains and spiritual leaders of teams are most often skilful players with the most one percenters. At the beginning of the 21st century, one percenters were officially recognised as a statistic. In 2007, the AFL Army Award was struck to reward, among other defensive skills, one percenters.\n\nThere are four actions which constitute a one percenter according to official AFL statistics: knock-ons, spoils, smothers, and shepherds.\n\nA knock-on is using the hand, either clenched or open, to tap the ball to the advantage of a team-mate, without ever taking possession of the football (except out of the ruck). It has the same advantage as a quick handpass or kick, but is not recognised as a disposal because the player never has possession.\n\nA spoil is preventing an opposition player from taking clean possession of a pass from a team-mate. This is most usually done by punching the ball away from the contest. In the 2011 semi-final against Sydney, Hawthorn defender Josh Gibson compiled an AFL record 21 spoils.\n\nA smother is the act of using the arms or body to get in the way of an opponent's kick, as it leaves the player's boot. A player who smothers the ball is generally seen diving across in front of the kicking player, hoping to trap the ball as it is kicked. Smothers sometimes lead to turn-overs, but not always.\n\nA shepherd is the legal act of preventing an opponent from obtaining the ball or tackling a team-mate.\n\nThere are other defensive efforts and supporting actions which are not statistically recognised as one percenters. However, when coaches refer to one percenters, these actions are often also considered.\n\nA chase is the act of making a long pursuit behind an opponent who is running with and bouncing the ball, even if he never catches up and tackles his opponent. A chase puts pressure on the opponent to kick while running quickly and/or while unstable, decreasing the likely accuracy of the kick. Hence, coaches will consider a chase to be a one percenter.\n\nHurrying (or corralling) an opponent is the act of putting them off balance without laying a tackle, while he is taking his kick or handpass. Like the chase, this increases the likelihood of a turnover, and is often considered to be a one percenter.\n\nA bump or hip and shoulder is the act of using the side of the body and running into an opponent with force - under some circumstances. The bump is a type of strong shepherd, but players can also legally bump their opponents out of the way as they run to collected the ball. A bump to an opponent is legal, provided the bump does not ride high and contact an opponent's head. A bump in the back is illegal under the \"push in the back\".\n\nA block or screen is a more subtle way to shepherd in a marking contest, and while it is often technically illegal, it will almost never be penalised. The most common way to block is to run between a leading forward and his pursuing opponent, slowing down the defender so that the forward will take his mark uncontested.\n\n"}

A May 27 free agent camp was held to recruit an initial roster of players.\n\nBrice arranged with Warner Pacific College for arena facilities for a summer youth basketball camp to be sponsored by the team, and for the competitive season to have begun in November, 2006. He had even contracted with the Jupiter Hotel to house visiting team members.\n\nPlans for the youth camp were quickly cancelled in July, 2006, following an article revealing that Brice, a Nevada native who had served as a high school and youth league coach, was a registered sex offender in both California and Oregon. As a result, he could not have unsupervised contact with girls under 18, except for his daughter. Warner Pacific, a Christian college affiliated with the conservative Church of God (Anderson), withdrew availability of their facilities.\n\nBrice sold the franchise to Christopher Sears less than a week later, telling a reporter for the \"Tribune,\" \"I am no longer associated with the Riptide due to the negativity and black cloud over my name.\" The league approved the transfer, and Joe Newman, ABA CEO, stated that the team would still play in the 2006 season.

This includes any stop in forward motion. A runout occurs when the horse quickly slides past or \"ducks out\" of a fence instead of jumping it, without stopping forward motion.\n\nRefusals and runouts are counted against riders in jumping competitions. In show jumping and the stadium phase of eventing, a refusal is worth four penalty points. In the cross-country phase of eventing, a refusal counts as 20 penalty points.\n\nRefusals also have the potential to unseat the rider, which may result in rider injury, such as that of Christopher Reeve. Refusals also present the possibility that the horse may crash into the obstacle. In extreme cases, however, it may be best for a horse to refuse rather than jump a fence which he cannot clear, as he might land on the fence, fall on landing, or flip over.\n\nThere are several reasons for refusals, and therefore a rider must try to identify the problem before reprimanding the horse for his disobedience.\n\nRider-based reasons\n\nPhysical problems\n\nIf a horse has begun to refuse frequently when before it was willing, a veterinary exam can be performed to rule out pain. When pain is ruled out as a factor, rider error is a very common cause for refusals; poor riding may place the horse in a position so that he physically would find it extremely difficult to clear the obstacle (such as too far or too close to the jump). Additionally, riders who do not release over the fence, preventing the horse from stretching down, will hit the horse in the mouth with the bit and cause pain. If this happens frequently, the horse will associate the pain with the jumping effort itself, and may begin to refuse. Horses that have begun to refuse due to rider error often require retraining.\n\nIf a horse is physically unable to jump a fence of a certain size or height, even with the best riding, pushing a horse may result in physical harm to the animal or cause an accident involving both horse and rider.\n"}

{"id": "3103206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3103206", "title": "Shere", "text": "Shere\n\nShere is a village in the Guildford district of Surrey, England east south-east of Guildford and west of Dorking, centrally bypassed by the A25. It is a small still partly agricultural village chiefly set in the wooded 'Vale of Holmesdale' between the North Downs and Greensand Ridge with many traditional English features. It has a central cluster of old village houses, shops including a blacksmith and trekking shop, tea house, art gallery, two pubs and a Norman church. Shere has a CofE infant and nursery school with 'outstanding academic results' (Ofsted 2015) catering for 2-7 year old children which serves the village and surrounding villages and towns, and a museum which opens most afternoons at weekends.\n\nThe River Tillingbourne runs through the centre of the village. More than four-fifths of homes are in the central area covering ; the northern area of Shere on the North Downs without any named hamlets, including the public hilltop park of Newlands Corner, covers .\n\nShere is also a civil parish, extending to the east and south into hamlets founded in the early Middle Ages which officially, in the 19th century, were consolidated into three villages. These are Gomshall, Holmbury St. Mary and Peaslake. This larger entity has a total population of 3,359 and area of (as at the 2011 census).\n\nShere appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as \"Essira\" and \"Essire\" in the ancient hundred of Blackheath. It was held by William the Conqueror. Its Domesday assets were: 1 church, 2 mills worth 10s per year, 14 ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth 50 hogs. It rendered £15 per year to its overlords.\n\nIn 1086, when Gomshall was royal demesne, the villeins (villagers) there were exempt from the sheriff's jurisdiction; Gomshall Netley and Gomshall Towerhill manors had court baron. Eleanor, Countess of Ormond owning the Vachery manor, had view of frankpledge in Gomshall Towerhill. In 1281 William Braose was granted free warren there\n\nIn the 13th century Roger de Clare settled for a life-rent on the church and sold the manor of Shere to a grandson of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex. In turn his grandson divided the manor, according with the law of moiety title to his daughter John Butler who thus received the new manor of Shiere Vachery; while Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster ('the red Earl') received Shiere Ebor(acum). Two other manors evolved.\n\nHighlights of the often influential tapestry of powerful owners include (but are not limited to):\n\nThe Victoria County History (Surrey: 1911) cites numerous mentions in the Assize Rolls, Patent Rolls, Feet of Fines and the ecclesiastical records of Westminster and Lambeth Palaces. Traditionally the parish included the areas of the current civil parish and measured about 4½ miles from north to south, and from 2 to 2½ miles from east to west and contained 6,400 acres of land and 12 of water.\n\nThe neighbourhood was for a time one of the wildest in Surrey: sheep-stealers, smugglers, and poachers found a refuge in these remote hills. Some of the cottages have, still existing, very large cellars (excavated easily in the sandy hill), stated to have been by H.E. Malden \"far too large for any honest purpose, and were no doubt made for storing smuggled goods till they could be conveniently taken on to London\".\n\nIn 1671, a Shere man called Edward Bound was charged by church authorities with \"playing cricket on the Sabbath\" and was exonerated, one of the sport's earliest references.\n\nIron was worked from the stone and into implements in centuries before the 18th century in Shere. In 1911 great quantities of watercress were grown which is no longer the case; the principal area in southern England for this being near the \"Watercress Line\", a railway in Hampshire.\n\nHolmbury St. Mary up in the Greensand Ridge was a modern village term devised in 1878 for the two hamlets of Felday in Shere and Pitland Street in Shere and Abinger, when the place became a civil parish and ecclesiastical parish. The Church of England schools were built in 1860 and enlarged in 1900.\n\nShere Infant and Nursery School has been serving the local community since 1852, celebrating its 175th birthday in 2017. The school received a 'Good' status from the Ofsted inspection in December 2015.\n\nThe church of St James is in the Early English style, most being 12th, 13th and 14th century. It replaced an earlier Anglo-Saxon church mentioned in the Domesday Book. Constructed of ironstone rubble with sandstone buttresses, it was restored in 1895 by S. Weatherley. By the north chancel wall there is a 14th-century quatrefoil window and squint – belonging to an Anchorite cell. There is 14th-century glass in the east window and the chancel fittings were renewed in 1956 by Louis Osman. It is a Grade I listed building.\n\nWithin the village centre conservation area are 34 listed buildings that pre-date 1830, in some cases by several centuries.\n\nThe village can be accessed for long distance travel from the north and west from the A3 at West Clandon – from the east the M25 at Leatherhead and the A24 at Dorking followed by the A25 road provides a shorter alternative route than taking the first route; there are minor routes south however the nearest major route directly south is the A24 at Dorking.\n\nGomshall railway station is less than away on the Reading to Gatwick line. While 1614 people (65% of the parish) in 2001 for instance were economically active, only 178 routinely used public transport and 1037 used motor vehicles. The average Shere commuter travels to work.\n\nThe economy is a mixture of local and regional with the many shops and some farming within it. A significant minority of the working population are London commuters, particularly in the civil parish at large. The 2001 census shows the self-employed (including with employees) form 36% of the population, retirees form 16% of the population and employees form 48% of the population. 77% of the ward's population is Christian, of the remainder 22% are of no religion or not stated.\n\nWithin the civil parish are shops, four village halls, and three post offices. Many walks radiate from the village, including a streamside walk, parts of the North Downs Way and the Pilgrims' Way. In the village are Millstream Press, a book publisher named after the Tillingbourne, a textiles-cum-boutique and Surrey Hills Brewery.\n\nThe United Kingdom Census 2011 considered the village as four relevant output layers, approximately a third of the ward \"Shere\", the latter being used for elections to Guildford Borough Council. All parts featured their single largest proportion of housing as either semi-detached or single-family homes and most of these with gardens.\n\nIn all 439 households (in slightly fewer homes) make up the village including its scattered farms and cottages. The census boundaries drawn exclude central and eastern Burrows Cross due to is proximity to slightly larger hamlet Gomshall, being contiguous and due south Burrows Cross had census overlap of its output areas (E00155528 and E00155529) and was included within Gomshall.\n\nThe proportion of households in three divisions of Shere who owned their home outright was at least 5% above the national average, in the fourth division this was 3% below, a central area including one of the two conservation area thoroughfares. The proportion of residents who owned their home with a loan was between 2.8% and 11.3% lower than the national average. The census shows that overall, Shere has a lower proportion than average of rented residential property and of social housing relative to the Surrey and national averages.\n\nAcross the whole parish the 2011 distribution of housing was:\n\nThe average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.\n\nAt Surrey County Council, one of the 81 representatives represents the area within the \"Shere\" division which includes Albury and (East and West) Clandon.\n\nAt Guildford Borough Council most wards of the borough are deemed appropriate to be represented under the current constitution of councillors by two to three councillors, which is the case for the \"Tillingbourne\" ward which has two.\n\n\nEven in 1911, the draws of a picturesque valley and authentic Tudor and similar architecture was considered among the finest in England, as such it has been used for numerous films, the Victoria County History which was written for the county of Surrey in 1911 lavished more praise than on any other village:\n\n\n\"Anchoress of Shere\" by Paul L. Moorcraft.\n\"The Passionate Friends\", a social commentary novel by H. G. Wells, places the protagonist's marriage here.\n\n"}

It originally aired May 27, 1987 on NBC. During its television debut it was preceded by a mockumentary showing past Goofy cartoons of him always getting everything wrong, and leading into the cartoon special where the audience is finally shown a competent, athletic Goofy who is the hero.\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie request Scrooge McDuck donate $1.49 to buy a championship trophy for their new soccer team. Scrooge gives an old trophy of his he thinks is worthless, but the boys pass the curator of the Duckburg Museum, who sees it is a rare artifact worth a million dollars. To win back the trophy, Scrooge is now made to sponsor his nephews, and he ends up enlisting the aid of a surprisingly athletic and agile Goofy, who ends becoming the team's coach when the nephews' teammates are shown as ragtag misfits, but the \"McDuck Greenbacks\" come together under \"Sport Goofy\"'s patient coaching and sharpen their soccer skills.\n\nUnfortunately, the Beagle Boys know of the trophy's value, and sought to enter the soccer tournament as well, but since they are out of shape and do not know anything about soccer, they decide Goofy is a problem and kidnap him. The team is disheartened by the loss of their team captain, but resolve to go on without him. Despite the excellent playing by the team members, the Beagle Boys engage in outright cheating and a nearsighted referee keeps declaring the Beagles' goals legit, ending the first half with a score of 10-0. Goofy quietly escapes the Beagles' hideout and gets to the field for the second half, which encourages the Greenbacks into incredible playing that not even the Beagles' cheating can counter, causing a comeback of 10-10.\n\nWhen the enraged Beagles resort to outright physically assaulting Goofy, Scrooge finally makes the referee wear his glasses, causing the referee to cry foul and set up a penalty shot. The Beagles' captain has secretly placed a bomb in the ball, and orders a Beagle to push the red button on the detonator when Goofy is ready to take his shot. Unfortunately, that Beagle is so uneducated he keeps pushing the green button, causing Sport Goofy to easily make the penalty goal past an overconfident goalie, thus the Greenbacks win 11-10. All of Duckburg rejoices except for the Beagles, whose angry captain pushes the red button causing the ball to explode and send all the Beagle Boys into a waiting police van. Now that Scrooge has his trophy back, he donates it to the Duckburg Museum, and joins the McDuck Greenbacks in their championship photo.\n\nThe cartoon marks the first time Russi Taylor voices Huey, Dewey, and Louie (taking the role from Clarence Nash) and Grandma Duck (taking the role from June Foray). Joe Ranft and Tad Stones wrote the story. Ranft went on to work for Pixar, while Stones went on to work at Walt Disney Television Animation, which was concurrently in production on \"DuckTales\", another pairing of Uncle Scrooge and his nephews. \"Sport Goofy in Soccermania\" is one of the few Disney cartoons where Uncle Scrooge was not voiced by his classic voice actor of Alan Young, but instead was voiced by Will Ryan.\n\n\"Sport Goofy in Soccermania\" was Darrell Van Citters' last production with Disney. He worked for Warner Bros. Animation for a couple years, before forming his own animation company, Renegade Animation.\n"}

{"id": "49371927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49371927", "title": "Stadium of Delphi", "text": "Stadium of Delphi\n\nThe Stadium of Delphi lies on the highest spot of the Archaeological Site of Delphi. It overlooks the sanctuary of Apollo and has a marvelous view to the Delphic Landscape. It was built either within the second half of the 4th century B.C. or even after the Galatian attacks. Its measured 178 meters in length and knew several refurbishment phases. Τhe Stadium of Delphi is the best preserved ancient stadium in Greece.\n\nThe stadium occupied the highest part of the site, built over and to the northwest of the sanctuary of Apollo. It is epigraphically attested as “the pythikon stadion\". To the north it was supported by the slope of the mountain, whereas to the south a wall was built to support the seats for the spectators. It is unknown when the site actually started being used for the Pythian Games. However, archaeological study proves that the actual architectural formation took place either within the second half of the 4th century or towards the mid-3rd century B.C., after the victory against the Galatians and possibly at the instigation of the Aetolian League. \nWithin the stadium took place the “gymnastic” contests, i.e. the track and field sports. Musical contests were probably organized there as well. A 2nd century B.C. inscription informs us on Satyr the Samian who performed a hymn “for the god and the Greeks” to the sound of the guitar.\n\nAnother interesting inscription, embedded on the eastern side of the support wall, is that forbidding to take out the wine destined for sacred rituals. The inscription has attracted the interest of epigraphists, but it has been proposed that maybe this was not its original place and that it is actually in second use.\n\nThe construction of the stadium can be discerned in at least four different phases. The initial construction dates, as mentioned above, to the 4th or mid-3rd century B.C. The latter dating coincides with the celebration of the Soteria, ceremonial celebration of the victory against the Galatians. Up to 20 athletes could compete simultaneously on the tracks, but soon the tracks were reduced to 17. The aphesis (starting points) were made of stone. The tiers on the south side were added only in 100 BC. A final restoration phase took place in the Roman period, consisting of the revetment of the tiers with stone.\n\nThe total capacity was about 6,500 spectators. The starting point is preserved on the east accompanied with two rows of incised slabs for placing the feet of the runners. Four pillars on the eastern side must have supported a monumental arch.\n\n"}

It is home to Hastings United who currently play in the Isthmian League, the club have used the ground since 1985 after the old Hastings United folded, having previously used the ground between 1920 and 1948. The current capacity stands at 4,050 although over 9,000 have been known to attend events in the past and the closure of the grass bank has decreased the capacity.\n\nThe site is first mentioned in 1560 as 'the Pilate Field', most likely a field used for growing pilled oats and where the area gets its name from. In 1886 the large sloping meadow was proposed as the new site for the Hastings Workhouse, however the proposal was met with opposition from local residents and landowners and the scheme was eventually dropped.\n\nIn 1920 the site was earmarked as a site of a potential new sports ground for the town alongside Horntye Park, with the Pilot Field being preferred as it could be ready to use for the 1920–21 football season. The site was acquired by the Hastings Corporation in June 1920, with the Hastings Sports Association taking control in August who did the necessary work needed on the ground for Rock-a-Nore FC to compete in the Sussex County League.\n\nThe first football match to take place was between Rock-a-Nore and Chichester, with the visitors winning in front of a crowd of at least 1,000. At first the site was simply a large slope with a football pitch fenced off, with the ground also being used for cricket and rugby. The site was split into two more level pitches (upper and lower), with a cycling track being constructed around the lower pitch. Despite already being in use for the two years the Pilot Field was officially opened on 8 November 1922, with a game between a Hastings representatives and Queens Park Rangers.\n\nIn 1925 work on the main stand had started and was officially opened in April 1926, in an opening ceremony where 1,500 assembled in the structure. The cycling track was upgraded to cinder in 1948, in preparation for the Hastings Saxons speedway team moving into the ground. The same year saw the Hastings & St Leonards amateur club get kicked off in favour for the newly formed professional club Hastings United, who would stay at the ground until 1985.\n\nThe ground would see a number of improvements during Hastings United's tenure, including the erection of two new stands at the Elphinstone Road end of the ground in the mid 1950s and the erection of floodlights in 1964. The old speedway track was eventually concreted over to allow spectators to get closer to the playing area and for the erection of the dugouts in front of the main stand. A new squash complex constructed in the opposite corner to the main turnstiles was opened in 1980, but was later sold off to recuperate some of the debt owed by Hastings United.\n\nIn 1985 Hastings United folded and Hastings Town moved in from the old upper pitch, now called the Firs, with the ground receiving minor refurbishment work to represent the club colours of red and white. By the 1990s the two Elphinstone Road end stands were in poor condition, with the stand directly behind the goal receiving a major renovation in the mid 1990s whilst the other stand was closed to spectators, before eventually being demolished by 2000. A new clubhouse was built in 1998 and then further extended the following year, with the old clubhouse under the main stand becoming the boardroom. A new stand was built ahead of the 2005–06 season and was named the 'Cole Warren' stand after two supporters, this structure consists of a small number of rows of terracing and elevated viewing area for wheelchair users. In 2010 four new sets of floodlights replaced the old pylons which had been erected in 1964 and in 2016 the club purchased the old squash complex which was now a sports and social club.\n\nThe most prominent structure at the ground is the main stand, which covers about three quarters of the length of one side of the pitch. The capacity is 800 for seated spectators mostly on wooden benches, but there are plastic seats to the centre in front of the public address box, some of which are reserved for board members and other guests. There are more plastic seats located to the left of this block covering the front rows, which were relocated from the Firs after St Leonards folded in 2004. Underneath the main stand are the changing rooms, boardroom and a tea bar. The age of the main stand have led to ever increasing maintenance costs for the club and is a major factor in their effort to find a new stadium.\n\nOn the opposite side to the main stand is a grass bank, which at one point was open to spectators but was fenced off for health and safety. The closing off of the bank meant the capacity of ground went from 9,000 to 4,050. To the east of the bank, is the Hastings United Sports and Social Club, purchased in 2016, this building contains a gym, a bar and a viewing deck. The east side of the ground is where the Cole Warren stand is, behind the stand, the remains of the speedway track still exists and is used as a car park for players. On the west side of the ground, is the Elphinstone Road end terrace, with the clubhouse immediately to the south. In the south-west corner is a building that houses the club shop, toilets and a tea bar.\n\nWhen first opened the ground was intended to be used by various sports including football, rugby and hockey. There are no known records of hockey taking place at the Pilot Field, but there are records of rugby being played. Cricket was also played at the ground between 1920-1922 before being split into upper and lower pitches. The Hastings & St Leonards cycling club also made use of the cycling track built in 1922. The venue also hosted sports days and athletic events.\n\nIn 1948 the Hastings Saxons moved to the venue after Eastbourne Eagles were forced out of their stadium at Arlington due to a petrol ban, however the club left in 1949 following complaints about the noise from local residents. The speedway meets regularly attracted crowds of 9,000. It was proposed to introduced greyhound racing at the Pilot Field in the 1960s, but there are no records to show any races ever happening.\n\nThe known recorded record attendance for football at the Pilot Field is 12,527, when Hastings United drew 3-3 against Norwich City 1953–54 FA Cup third round tie. The record attendance a game featuring the newer Hastings United, is 4,888 in a friendly against Nottingham Forest when they were Hastings Town.\n\nThe Hastings Saxons regularly attracted crowds of 9,000 but it is unknown if they ever attracted a crowd larger than 12,527.\n\nThe ground is located 1.1 miles away from Ore railway station, which is situated on the Marshlink line between Hastings railway station and Ashford International. Hastings railway station is located 1.6 miles away and served by Southern and Southeastern. Situated on the Marshlink Line, East Coastway line to Brighton and the Hastings line to Tonbridge, this station has more frequent services.\n"}

From 1959 to 1978, the baths were called Sunset Pool. Owned by the City of Randwick, Wylie's Baths is run by a management committee established in 1978 comprising representatives from South Maroubra Dolphins Winter Swimming Club, Randwick & Coogee Amateur Swimming Club, the Coogee-Randwick RSL Diggers Swimming Club, and the Coogee Surf Life Saving Club.\n\nAboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug, while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \"Muru-ora-dial\". By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. Few religious beliefs of the people were recorded, but oral traditions have ensured that some have been carried on. Thus it is thought that the Wylie's Baths location may have been a special place for women's business, possibly associated with birthing, although more research needs to be done to confirm this. There is now a sizable community of Aboriginal people living in the Randwick municipality, many to the south of Coogee in La Perouse.\n\nOne of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street.\n\nRandwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821–86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the he bought from Marsh, and called his property \"Randwick\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.\n\nRandwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive.\n\nIn 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859.\n\nRandwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life.\n\nToday, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital.\n\nFollowing the opening of the tram line to Coogee Bay in 1883, Coogee became a popular seaside resort. Coogee became well known for its beach and seaside entertainments, similar to Manly and Bondi. The Coogee Aquarium opened in December 1887 and included a ballroom and indoor swimming pool. Other beach amusements included swings, donkey rides, bandstand and an outdoor slide and toboggan rink. Later amusements included the Coogee Pleasure Pier built in 1928 (demolished in 1933), the shark net installed in 1929 (removed in 1939) and floodlights for night surfing.\n\nThe late nineteenth century also saw the development of swimming as a competitive sport, in contrast to \"bathing\" as a therapeutic activity. The first British amateur swimming association was formed in 1869, and the Balmain Swimming Club was formed in March 1884. In 1891 the NSW Amateur Swimming Association was formed by men's swimming clubs and in 1906 women swimmers formed their own association. Fred Cavill arrived in Sydney in 1879 and, with his sons, managed a number of harbourside pools (for example, Lavender Bay) and helped to popularise competitive and long-distance swimming. His son, Dick Cavill introduced the crawl from the Solomon Islands which revolutionised swimming and another son, Sydney Cavill developed the butterfly stroke.\n\nA number of Sydney ocean and harbourside pools date from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, prior to the main construction phase of ocean and harbour pools in the 1930s and 1940s. Examples includes the Dawn Fraser Pool (1882), Bondi Beach Pool (), the original Manly Cove Baths (c.1890), the original Brighton Baths (c.1900), Watson Bay Baths (c.1905) and Dee Why Rock Pool (). Many of these pools were built as Olympic-sized pools with raised seating to cater for competitive swimming events. North of Wylie's Baths are two more rock pools: the Ross Jones Memorial Baths (built 1947) and the McIver Women's Baths. These occupy the site of a women's bathing spot since before 1876. The Women's Baths were built in 1886 and since 1922 have been managed by the Randwick Coogee Ladies Amateur Swimming Club, formed by Rose McIver and Mina Wylie. At the northern end of Coogee Beach is another rock pool: Giles Baths, which was built in 1902 for men only. By 1909 it was known as the Randwick Municipal Baths. While now in disrepair, the pool is still in use.\n\nIn the early 1900s Henry Alexander Wylie, a champion long-distance and under-water swimmer - and an amateur builder - obtained a lease for the area below the high water mark (the area above high water mark being Crown Reserve). In 1907 Wylie constructed the present ocean pool, which opened on 12 December 1907. It was originally fenced with a metal hand rail along the eastern edge. At some stage the original fence was replaced with a timber and metal rail which enclosed the pool on three sides. In 1912 Wylie constructed the high timber boardwalk that encloses two sides of the pool, and two change rooms. The deck was elevated by a post and beam construction in blackbutt timber. The posts were embedded into sockets cut into the sandstone cliff face and into the large rocks at the base of the cliff. Wylie also constructed a concrete diving tower on the eastern wall. There was a slippery dip into the pool on the north-western corner. At some stage a second diving tower was located on the southern end. Night bathing and picnicking became popular when Wylie erected three lamp posts along the northern edge and also strung lights across the pool. None of these structures remain today, although the concrete wall on the eastern edge is still thickened at the location of the demolished diving tower, and the concrete bases of the lamp posts can still be seen along the northern edge. At a later date Wylie extended the timber platform, considerably increasing the size of the change rooms at either end.\n\nEntrance to the baths was from either Grant Reserve or Neptune Street. A fee was collected at the caretaker's cottage (which no longer exists) and swimming costumes issued. There were clothes lockers and possibly a refreshment outlet. The path wound down to timber stairs, which led to the change rooms (men's change room to the right and women's to the left).\n\nWylie's daughter was the well-known Olympic swimmer Wilhelmina (Mina) Wylie (1891-1984) who grew up in South Coogee. Mina Wiley and Sarah (Fanny) Durack (1889-1956) were Australia's first two female Olympic swimming representatives when they competed in the Stockholm Olympics in 1912 (the first Olympic Games to admit female swimmers). In the 100-metre freestyle race, Durack won the gold medal and Wylie the silver medal. Mina Wiley competed in NSW and Australian championships from 1906 to 1934, winning a total of 115 NSW and Australian titles. As Australia's first Olympic female swimmers, Durack and Wylie inaugurated a long tradition of Australian female swimming champions.\n\nAnother well-known swimmer closely associated with Wylie's Baths is long-distance ocean swimmer, Des Renford (1927-1999). Renford swam the English Channel 19 times, was a Papal Knight and is featured in the NSW Hall of Champions at the State Sports Centre. He was a regular all-year-round swimmer at Wylie's where he was always conceded the best lane \"on the wall\" and was a member of the Wylie's Baths Trust and active in the management of the baths. Other swimmers of note associated with Wylie's Baths include Fanny Durack, Bob Parry and Paul Gately.\n\nOn 5 November 1959 the lease for Wiley's Baths was transferred to Desmond Selby, who paid an annual rent of $500. Selby renamed the baths \"Sunset Pool\" and proceeded to upgrade the facilities. Selby removed the existing change rooms and increased the width of the boardwalk. He rebuilt the change rooms on a much smaller scale to provide a larger deck area, catering to the then fashion for sunbathing. At this stage the majority of the balustrade was fully boarded leaving only seven central sections with horizontal timber rails. The northern end of the boardwalk past the women's change room led to an open sitting area which became a popular picnic spot with views over Coogee Beach. Selby used tram parts to construct the building and installed hot showers. Both change rooms had cement roofing and wooden panelling and were externally painted in a checkerboard design in cream and brown. He also added a kiosk and store on the boardwalk.\n\nThe buildings and pool were badly damaged in May 1974 by high seas and the pool was closed to the public. Another storm in 1977 caused further damage. In 1978 the baths were re-opened under the control of Randwick Municipal Council and reverted to the original name of Wylie's Baths. A Committee of Management was formed in September 1978, composed of representatives from the Randwick Council and various swimming clubs including the South Maroubra Dolphins (formed 1960), Randwick/ Coogee Amateur Swimming Club (formed 1896), Randwick Digger's Swimming Club (formed 1936) and Coogee Surf Life Saving Club.\n\nIn 1994 Randwick City Council resolved to repair the baths in response to public pressure. The successful tenderers were architects Allen Jack+Cottier, and restoration cost approximately $750,000. The work was completed early in 1995. In 1995 Allen, Jack & Cottier were awarded the NSW Greenway Award for Conservation by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects for their restoration of Wylie's Baths. The work included restoring the boardwalk and building new amenities blocks. The work was praised by the RAIA for its sensitivity in recovering the essence of the original baths. While the nature and style of the new work was clearly modern, it paid attention to the genius loci of the baths, adding a new layer to its history.\n\nIn 1996 Wylie's Baths Trust was established to manage the baths. The Trust consists of representatives of the four local swimming clubs, three local residents and a representative of the Randwick City Council.\n\nIn recent years Wylie's Baths has become popular subject for both amateur and professional photographers. The dramatic cliff-hugging location of the baths is one aspect of their photographic appeal, as is the nostalgic seaside appeal of the wooden structures.\n\nWylie's Baths is located on the rocks at the southern end of Coogee Beach with an entrance off Neptune Street via Grant Reserve.\n\nThe pool is a rock and concrete pool by located on a natural rock shelf below the high tide mark with concrete walls around four sides. It measures long and wide (to provide a Olympic swimming length) and the depth of the pool varies from about in the south-west corner to about in the north-east corner. It is flushed twice daily by tidal action.\n\nA high prominent timber boardwalk supported on timber posts wraps around the rock face on two sides of the pool and is clearly visible from Coogee Beach. Three sets of timber stairs lead down to the pool and rock shelf from the boardwalk. Amenities include men's and women's change rooms, kiosk and store. A steel fence runs around the northern and eastern sides of the pool, preventing access to the rocks.\n\nAs at 30 January 2003, following extensive restoration in 1995, the baths are in good condition. Wylie's Baths have been repaired and altered over time. These alterations have been necessary for maintenance especially given the harshness of the marine environment. These alterations have tended to preserve the original vernacular nature of the buildings and contributed to a sense of continuity in the built forms. The extensive restoration by Allen Jack+Cottier in 1995 was praised by the RAIA for its sensitivity in recovering of the original essence of the baths while upgrading and modernising the facilities. Following the 1995 restoration, Wylie's Baths are in good condition.\n\n\nAs at 29 October 2004, Wylie's Baths is of State significance as one of NSW's oldest, most intact and best-known ocean swimming pools. It is also significant for the possibility that its location was special to Aboriginal women's business. Built in 1907, Wylie's Baths survives as a turn-of-the-century bathing complex, including an Olympic-size pool, elevated boardwalk, change rooms, kiosk and store, which evidences the development of sport and recreational facilities in Sydney. Wylie's Baths has been used for many competitive and recreational events, including amateur swimming clubs, fitness training, learn-to-swim classes as well as for general swimming, sunbathing and as a popular gathering place. Wylie's Baths has been held in great affection by generations of Sydneysiders.\n\nWylie's Baths is closely associated with the development of competitive swimming in Australia and with many swimmers of note, including Henry Alexander Wylie, Mina Wylie and Sarah (Fanny) Durack and Des Renford (long-distance ocean swimmer). It is one of a group of significant Sydney harbour and ocean pools associated with Australian swimming champions. Because of its association with the inaugural championship swimming of Mina Wiley and Fanny Durack at the Stockholm Olympics of 1912, Wylie's Baths is especially associated with Australian women's swimming.\n\nWylie's Baths is a well-known Sydney landmark, clearly visible from Coogee Beach and making use of its spectacular ocean setting. It is a popular subject with photographers and makes a large contribution to Coogee's identity as a seaside destination. The elevated timber boardwalk is architecturally striking and rare in Sydney. It is a good example of vernacular architecture and an ingenious design solution to the problem of providing amenities on a steep cliff face. Recent restoration of the baths by Allen Jack and Cottier in 1995 won the RAIA Greenway Medal for Conservation and was praised for its sensitivity in preserving the integrity of the original swimming pool complex.\n\nWylie's Baths may have significance and special meaning for Aboriginal groups, both pre and post-contact. There may be special associations with Aboriginal women and birthing but further research is required.\n\nWylie's Baths was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 November 2003 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nIt is thought that the location for Wylie's Baths may be, or may be near a place that was special to Aboriginal women's business, possibly associated with birthing, although more research needs to be done to confirm this.\n\nWylie's Baths survives as one example of the numerous seaside attractions built at Coogee Beach around the turn of the twentieth century to attract visitors and day-trippers, with other attractions including an aquarium, pier, shark net, floodlighting etc. The construction of Wylie's Baths in 1907 coincided with an emerging interest in seaside baths in Sydney. Wylie's Baths forms a group with the three other ocean pools at Coogee Beach which date from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: McIver Women's Baths (built 1886); Giles, former men's only (built 1902); and the Ross Jones Memorial Pool (built 1947). It is claimed in the National Trust survey of ocean and harbour pools that Wylie's Baths is the oldest surviving communal sea baths in Australia.\n\nWylie's Baths is also historically significant in the development of amateur swimming clubs in Sydney and the development of competitive swimming in Australia. It forms a group with a number of other early Olympic-sized harbour and ocean swimming pools in Sydney built between the 1880s and the First World War to cater to the popularity of competitive swimming. This group of early pools predate the main construction phase of ocean pools in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.\n\nWylie's Baths is strongly associated with the Wylie family who were important in the development of competitive swimming in Australia. Wylie's Baths was built by Henry Alexander Wylie who was a champion long-distance and underwater swimmer. He managed the baths from 1907 until 1959.\n\nWylie's Baths is closely associated with many swimmers of note including female Olympic champions, Mina Wylie and Sarah (Fanny) Durack, and long-distance swimmer, Des Renford.\n\nWilhelmina (Mina) Wylie (1891-1984) was the daughter of Henry Alexander Wylie and an early female swimming champion. Together with Sarah (Fanny) Durack (1889-1956), Mina Wylie represented Australia at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics (the first Olympic Games to admit female swimmers). Durack won the gold medal and Wylie the silver for the 100 metres freestyle. In an extraordinary swimming career which spanned from 1906 to 1934 Mina Wylie won every NSW and Australian swimming title (a total of 115), making her and Fanny Durack the first in a long line of Australian female swimming champions.\n\nMina Wylie was also important in promoting women's swimming. She, with Rose McIver, formed the Randwick Coogee Ladies Amateur Swimming Club which has managed the Women's Baths just north of Wylie's since 1922.\n\nWylie's Baths is also strongly associated with long-distance ocean swimming champion, Des Renford (1927-1999) was swam the English Channel 19 times, was awarded an MBE, and was a regular swimmer at Wylie's and active in the management of the Wylie's Baths Trust.\n\nWylie's Baths is one of a group of harbour and ocean swimming pools which have strong associations with an Australian swimming champion. Others include the Andrew (Boy) Charlton Pool in the Domain and the Dawn Fraser Swimming Pool in Balmain and the McIver Women's Baths in Coogee, the Lavender Bay Baths, now demolished (associated with the Cavill family).\n\nWylie's Baths is also associated with the architects, Allen Jack and Cottier, whose conservation work was awarded the 1995 Greenway Award for Conservation by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nWylie's Baths, located on the rocks at the southern end of Coogee Beach, makes use of a dramatic ocean setting. The raised timber boardwalk is architecturally striking and wraps around the rock face on two sides. It offers uninterrupted views across the water and rocks to Coogee Beach. The baths are a popular swimming and picnic spot.\n\nThe baths and the raised boardwalk are also very prominent and clearly visible from Coogee Beach. The baths have become a well-known Sydney landmark and closely identified with Coogee Beach as a holiday seaside destination.\n\nThe baths, despite recent extensive conservation, survive as possibly the last intact example of a turn-of-the-century ocean swimming complex, complete with timber boardwalk, change rooms, kiosk and store. The raised boardwalk, in particular, is rare among Sydney ocean and harbour pools for its size and construction. It offers an ingenious design solution to the problem of providing amenities on a steep cliff face site and represents a good example of vernacular architecture.\n\nWylie's Baths has also become a popular subject for amateur and professional photographers. Photographic studies typically feature the dramatic ocean setting, the stark architectural qualities of the wooden structures, and the nostalgic seaside appeal of the setting.\n\nThe place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nWylie's Baths has social significance for the generations of Sydneysiders who have visited the baths since they opened in 1907. The baths are held in great affection for their associations with seaside holiday memories and recreational swimming. The baths have been used for many competitive and recreational events, including amateur swimming clubs, fitness training, learn-to-swim classes as well as for general swimming, sunbathing and as a popular gathering place.\n\nWylie's Baths is also significant to a number of local Coogee amateur swimming clubs: South Maroubra Dolphins (formed 1960), Randwick / Coogee Amateur Swimming Club (formed 1896), Randwick Digger's Swimming Club (formed 1936) and Coogee Surf Life Saving Club. These clubs have had a long involvement with the site and were instrumental in re-opening Wylie's Baths after the storm damage in the 1970s.\n\nWylie's Baths is highly significant to the Coogee community as a local landmark and as contributing to the sense of place and identity of Coogee of a seaside resort. The high esteem in which it is held is demonstrated by the community agitation for its conservation and re-opening following the damage by storms in the 1970s. The local community continues to be involved in the ongoing management of the baths via the Wylie's Baths Trust, which consists of representatives from local swimming clubs, the general public and Randwick Council.\n\nWylie's Baths is also held in high regard by the wider Sydney Community as a landmark and for its historical significance as an ocean pool. This esteem is demonstrated by the numerous heritage listings for the baths (Randwick City Council LEP, National Trust of Australia (NSW), Australian Heritage Commission - interim).\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nDue to the harshness of the marine environment and the European occupation of the site since the 1900s, Wylie's Baths is unlikely to yield any archaeological evidence of former Aboriginal occupation or European occupation in the nineteenth century. Nor is the site likely to yield further scientific information in relation to the natural environment.\n\nThe pool and the unusual timber boardwalk, despite various modifications over time, have potential to yield further information on turn-of-the-century vernacular construction techniques and as such are of technical and research significance.\n\nThe baths may have significance and special meaning for Aboriginal groups, both pre and post-contact. Further research is required to investigate this possibility.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nWylie's Baths can be considered rare among Sydney's ocean and harbour pools in surviving as a complete turn-of-the-century swimming complex that includes an Olympic-sized pool, boardwalk, men's and women's change rooms, kiosk and store. The sensitivity of the recent conservation works, completed in 1995, has respected and preserved the integrity of the original swimming complex.\n\nThe size and height of the timber boardwalk at Wylie's Baths is possibly unique amongst Sydney ocean and harbour pools. The boardwalk is a well-known Sydney landmark and survives where other once-common timber boardwalks have not. As such, it is rare.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nWylie's Baths is a good representative example of an ocean swimming pool built around Sydney's ocean beaches and harbour foreshores in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In being built of rock and concrete, the pool shares construction features with a number of other Sydney pools, including Bondi, Fairlight and Narrabeen Pools. These pools largely rely on tidal flushing to clean the water and pre-date the use of chlorination.\n\nWylie's Baths also has a timber boardwalk in common with a number of pools, including the Dawn Fraser Pool in Balmain, Northbridge Baths and Redleaf Pool in Double Bay. Because of the need for ongoing repair and maintenance of these timber structures, some others have not survived.\n\n\n\n"}
