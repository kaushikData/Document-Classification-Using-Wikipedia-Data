{"id": "172997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172997", "title": "Airsoft", "text": "Airsoft\n\nAirsoft is a competitive team shooting sport in which participants shoot opponents with spherical plastic projectiles launched via replica air weapons called airsoft guns. Airsoft is commonly compared to paintball, which is a recreational shooting sport similar in concept but with many important key differences.\n\nUnlike paintballs (which a paintball gun would use), airsoft pellets, or BB's, do not typically mark their target, and hits are not always visibly apparent. Though the pellets can leave red marks or \"welts\" on exposed skin, the game relies heavily on an honor system in which it is the ethical duty of the person who has been hit to call themselves out, regardless of whether or not anyone saw it happen.\n\nAnother difference to paintball is that all airsoft guns are magazine-fed from the bottom, with some (especially pistols) having replaceable compressed gas (e.g. propane, 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane/\"green gas\" or ) canisters. Many airsoft guns also have mounting platforms compatible with genuine firearm accessories, and tend to more closely resemble real guns. This makes them more popular for military simulation and historical reenactments.\n\nGameplay varies in style and composition, but often range from short-term skirmishes, organized scenarios, close quarters battle, field, military simulations (MilSim) or historical reenactments. They are played in indoor courses or outdoor fields. Combat situations on the battlefield may involve the use of military tactics to achieve objectives set in each game. Participants may attempt to emulate the tactical equipment and accessories used by modern military and police organizations. A game is normally kept safe by trained professionals and the equipment is usually powered by gas or various types of batteries.\n\nBefore gameplay, an airsoft gun's muzzle velocity is usually checked through a chronograph and usually measured in feet per second (FPS). Different game sites allow a different amount of FPS, but different countries may also have a set FPS restriction, and a gun shooting over the required FPS can be confiscated or not allowed to be used on airsoft sites; for instance, a sniper rifle would usually have a higher FPS than a submachine gun, since a sniper needs a minimum engagement range to reduce the danger of players being hit at close range by a powerful equipment.\n\nAirsoft originated from Japan in the early 1970s, trademarked as \"soft air guns\", tailoring to the needs of shooting enthusiasts while conforming to Japan's strict gun control. The name \"soft air\" referred to the compressed Freon-silicone oil mixture (known as \"green gas\") that was used as a propellant, which was significantly weaker than the carbon dioxide used in proper airguns. Originally designed for target shooting, their plastic pellets can be shot at humans without causing injury and this became popular for casual war-games. Airsoft guns spread to the UK in the late 1980s and early 1990s with a company called LS. The guns were sold in pieces and had to be assembled before they were capable of firing pellets. Airsoft equipment was designed to closely emulate real guns. Since the mid-1980s, airsoft guns have been adapted with a purely recreational application in mind, and the sport is enjoyed by all ages. Airsoft replicas are produced globally, with the majority being manufactured in Asia. Many law enforcement agencies and military units within the United States now use Airsoft for force-on-force training drills.\n\nOn impact, the pain an airsoft pellet causes is directly related with the kinetic energy it has. This energy is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity. It is important to note that \"doubling\" the velocity of a pellet will \"quadruple\" its kinetic energy. As a reference value, a 6 mm 0.20 gram pellet, which is the most common size and weight, traveling at has one joule of kinetic energy.\n\nA typical set of velocity for sanctioned fields in the United States on guns may be and under for Close Quarters Battle (Skirmish), and under for outdoor play with fully automatic Airsoft Electric Guns (AEGs), for semi-auto DMR style AEG's, and for bolt-action sniper rifles, for a 0.20 g pellet.\n\nThe maximum effective range of field-legal airsoft guns is all around with a highly upgraded sniper rifle replica. Most airsoft guns used for field play will have an effective range of around 43–67 metres, depending on the intended role of the equipment. Most Airsoft guns are capable of shooting from to , although it is also possible to purchase upgraded internals for some Airsoft guns that will enable the gun to shoot up to or higher. In California a common limit for CQB is . In Ireland, Italy, and Japan the energy limit for Airsoft guns is one joule regardless of the type of game play. Some UK sites allow semi-automatic-only equipment up to 88 m/s (290 ft/s) and bolt-action rifles up to 95 m/s (310 ft/s). However, the majority of UK sites allow both semi-automatic equipment and bolt-action rifles up to 107 m/s (350 ft/s). Northern Ireland has a maximum velocity of with 0.20 g pellets, without regard to the type of equipment. In Sweden the legal limitations of airsoft guns caps the energy limit at 10 joules for single fire guns and 3 joules for semi-automatic and fully automatic guns.\n\nThe ballistics of spring or electrically powered airsoft guns differ from real firearms in that a longer barrel will not always result in better accuracy. In spring/electric airsoft equipment, barrel length does not have a significant effect on accuracy. The \"sweet spot\" for barrel length in a spring/electric powered airsoft gun is around 450 mm. Past that length, added barrel length will not improve accuracy. In any case, barrel quality, velocity consistency, and hopup quality/design are more important factors with regard to accuracy. Added barrel length will result in slightly increased velocity if the cylinder size and compression are appropriate for the barrel length. For example, a gun with a large cylinder and a long barrel will shoot slightly harder than a gun with a small cylinder and a short barrel (ceteris paribus). This rule will apply even for barrels longer than 500 mm, if there is enough cylinder volume and air compression to propel the pellet through the barrel. However, the resulting velocity increase will be hardly noticeable. The only considerable advantage of using a longer inner barrel in an AEG or spring powered gun is that it generally will make the gun quieter.\n\nGas powered replicas function more like real firearms. In gas powered guns, added barrel length (to an appropriate degree) will result in significantly increased velocity, and increased accuracy to a degree.\nTighter bore barrels will increase velocity because there will be less space between the pellet and the barrel for the air to escape through. Most stock airsoft guns have 6.05-6.08 mm bore barrels, but best performance is usually seen with \"tightbore\" barrels, which are 6.01 to 6.05 in diameter. However, the tighter the bore, the more likely the chance of a pellet jam, and subsequently, tightbores need to be cleaned regularly. It is generally agreed upon that a good quality 6.01-6.02 mm barrel will provide the highest muzzle velocity, while a good quality 6.03 mm or 6.05 mm barrel will provide the best compromise between power, accuracy, and ease of maintenance. The actual accuracy difference between tightbore sizes is debatable and usually outweighed by bore consistency.\n\nMany manufacturers and retailers suggest treating an airsoft gun like a real gun at all times. This will help alleviate safety issues resulting in an accidental/negligent discharge to an unknowing target or an airsoft gun being mistaken for a real firearm. Most manufacturers include an orange tip on the barrel of the airsoft gun for safety purposes. Manufacturers and retailers urge consumers to not remove the orange tip of the airsoft rifle as it is used to help distinguish them from a real firearm. The orange tip serves many purposes, one of them being for law enforcement to help discern airsoft guns from real firearms.\n\nThe minimum safe level of gear required to participate in most games includes a pair of ballistic eyewear ANSI Z87.1 (impact-rated) goggles to protect participants' eyes. Traditional prescription glasses and sunglasses, or goggles not designed specifically for use with airsoft or paintball marker, may break or shatter upon being struck, causing injury to the eye. Airsoft guns are not to be confused with BB guns, which fire metal ball bearings.\n\nRules such as a maximum muzzle velocity and engagement distance guidelines are used by different groups. Some organizations have created common safety rules and guidelines.\n\nWhen not actively playing, some fields require \"barrel bags\", also known as barrel socks, barrel condoms, barrel blockers, or barrel sleeves, to be placed over the muzzle of the gun. The magazine is usually removed as well, and the gun fired to clear the chamber. Most fields also require players to leave their guns set to the safety position when they are not shooting, a practice common when using real firearms. In certain countries, such as the Philippines, additional special rules have been adopted.\n\nAirsoft is legal in most parts of the world. Some countries have specific restrictions, such as maximum muzzle velocity and \"unrealistic\" coloring to distinguish them from actual firearms. They are legal throughout the United States, but restrictions do exist in cities like Chicago and Detroit. The states of New Mexico, New York and New Jersey, however, do not allow airsoft guns to be used or handled publicly because of the resemblance to real firearms. They may be used on private property with the consent of the owner. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection FAQ page states that Airsoft guns are considered look-alike firearms which require the special blaze orange marking.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland Airsoft guns are classified as Realistic Imitation Firearms but not restricted as much as in the United Kingdom. Under the Criminal Justice Act of 2006 Airsoft guns are legal in the Republic. One can buy, sell and import Airsoft guns without notifying relevant law enforcement authorities. They do not need to be painted in fluorescent colors, they do not need to have an orange tip, but they cannot launch the projectile with a kinetic energy exceeding 1 joule. However, carrying an imitation firearm in public is prohibited, and a gun carry case is required, as for real firearms. Airsoft shops are spread over the country, and buyers must be aged 16 or over to purchase an airsoft gun. There is no age limit on Airsoft, as long as a minor has an adult's permission.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, some Airsoft guns are classified as realistic imitation firearms or RIFs. The sale, manufacture, or importation (but not gifting) of these is illegal under the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. A defence is allowed for selling for specific purposes including airsoft skirmishing\n\nThe minimum age for buying any imitation firearm in the UK is 18. It is an offence to possess an imitation firearm in a public place without a reasonable excuse, for example travelling to, or from, or being at an airsoft skirmish site.\n\nMost UK airsoft sites and retailers participate in the United Kingdom Airsoft Retailer Association (UKARA) registration scheme. A player who has participated in at least 3 skirmishes over a period of at least 56 days at the same skirmish site can be registered by that site. Retailers have access to the database to verify that the purchaser can provide them with a defence.\n\nAs an alternative to RIFs, IFs (Imitation Firearms, including 'two tones') are available in the UK. These are RIFs which have been painted a bright colour (excluding white/silver/gold) over at least 51% of the item. No specific defence is required for selling an IF, although the minimum age for purchasing remains 18.\n\nIn Canada, there are laws pertaining to airsoft importing. All airsoft guns that are bought in Canada are legal, but when importing it, the gun has to have between 366FPS and 500FPS to pass inspection at customs, otherwise the gun will be shipped back or destroyed.\n\nIn certain countries use of lasers of any kind is illegal, including airsoft gun scopes with integrated lasers.\n\nAlthough airsoft guns in the United States are generally sold with a or longer orange tip on the barrel in order to distinguish them from real firearms, this is not required by federal law. Manufacturers and importers may cite Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which stipulates that \"no person shall manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm\" without approved markings; these may include an orange tip, orange barrel plug, brightly colored exterior of the whole toy, or transparent construction (part 272.2, formerly part 1150.2). However, section 272.1 (formerly 1150.1) clearly indicates that these restrictions shall not apply to \"traditional B-B, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of compressed air, compressed gas or mechanical spring action, or any combination thereof.\" This language clearly exempts airsoft guns from these requirements, placing them in the same category as BB-guns, pellet, air, and paintball, none of which are conventionally sold or used with an orange tip, and many of which bear as much resemblance to real firearms as airsoft guns do.\n\nThe guns used in airsoft are typically imitation firearms. They have a mechanism for shooting projectiles 6 mm or 8 mm in diameter.\n\nAirsoft guns are classified according to their operating principle, which can be spring-loaded, electric (battery-powered Automatic Electric Guns, Airsoft Electric Guns or \"AEGs\"), or gas-powered (if these have a blowback feature they are known as \"GBBs\"). Some companies produce full replicas of counterpart grenade launchers which fire a projectile spray of pellets by use of a high-powered spring mechanism or a compressed gas propellant (i.e. green gas, propane, compressed air, or CO). There is also a type of airsoft gun that is powered by a single (HPA) high-pressure air tank and a battery pack to power the internal FCU \"Fire Control Unit\" computer board. These guns are often known for their high and adjustable ROF or \"rate of fire\" and durability. These HPA replicas are most often referred to as \"PolarStars\", although this refers to a popular brand of HPA engines and accessories.\n\nNewer guns, especially those made in Taiwan and China, have metal internal and external parts. Japan has specific rules about producing airsoft guns with metal parts. A typical airsoft gun is noticeably lighter than its \"real steel\" counterpart due to the use of aluminum, alloy, and plastic, though some have weights in them for a more realistic feel. Smoke caps, as well as noise amplifiers, are available for certain airsoft guns to add realism.\n\nGas handgun magazines usually contain 10 to 30 pellets in a standard capacity magazine; however, some are high capacity magazines and can hold 50 rounds or more. In the case of AEG rifles, magazines come in either real-capacity (equivalent to the capacity of its real steel counterpart), low-capacity (10-50 rounds), mid-capacity (75-160 rounds), or high-capacity (190+ rounds). These magazines are spring-loaded. The high-cap magazines often have a ratchet wheel that can be wound up periodically to force pellets up from the holding chamber of the magazine to the feeding chute. Due to loose pellets in the reservoir, they often make a rattling noise when running or walking. Some airsoft guns have a battery-powered box or drum magazine that holds thousands of pellets, but these are usually only used and allowed on LMGs (light machine gun)type replicas.\n\nIt is common for owners to \"tech\" or modify their guns. The majority of gearboxes are made to Tokyo Marui specifications and have upgrade parts available. Some gearboxes are proprietary in design. It is also possible to perform DIY modifications.\n\nThe \"hop-up\" system, which is installed in most stock airsoft rifles and in most pistols, is used to add extra effective range by putting backspin on the pellets. The Magnus effect causes the pellets to experience lift as they are shot, counteracting against gravity. A small rubber nub protrudes into the top of the barrel through a small hole, and it catches the top of the pellet as it flies past. Adjusting the hop-up makes the nub protrude more or less into the barrel, so that backspin is increased or reduced. Ideally, the hop-up should be adjusted so that the pellets fly as far as possible in a straight line without curving upward too far, or dropping to the ground too quickly. Hop-Up does decrease the velocity of the projectile (a gun firing with the hop fully unwound can drop to as low as ). Ease and location of adjustment varies by gun design; some equipment provide controls that can be adjusted quickly during gameplay, while others may require partial dis-assembly. For example, a common location for Hop-Up adjustment is where the ejection port would be on a real firearm, which allows the mechanism to be covered while still allowing quick access to adjust the Hop-Up.\n\nMost airsoft guns fire round plastic pellets, usually white, but black \"invisible\" or phosphorescent are common as well. The pellets mostly range from 0.12 to 0.48 g. However, the most popular weights for AEGs (automatic electric guns) and GBB* (Gas Blow-Back guns) are 0.20 g and 0.25 g (*These weights are generally specified for pistols whose muzzle velocity ranges from approximately to ). Mid to high end AEGs use 0.20–0.30 g pellets, while heavier rounds (0.30–0.43 g) are typically used in long range and sniper applications since they are more stable in flight and less easily deflected by wind.\n\nPellets are usually bought in bags or bottles of 2,000 to 5,000, but other sizes are available, such as a 250,000 round (65 kg) package of tournament grade pellets. Biodegradable pellets are a fraction more expensive than non-bio counterparts, but many fields require them. Pellets are typically 6 mm in diameter, though 8 mm pellets do exist. Pellets vary by diameter depending on the brand (e.g. Matrix pellets are 5.95 mm in diameter and let less air slip past it during travel through the barrel, whereas Crosman pellets are 5.93 mm in diameter and allow more air to slip past during travel through the barrel and allow for less velocity). Pellets are used for the majority of play, although foam balls may be used to represent M203 grenade launcher shells.\n\nSome players customize their airsoft guns, either to improve performance or for purely aesthetic reasons. Additions include scopes, fore-grips and flashlights, red dot sights being the most commonly used. Red dot sights are used to help aim, fore-grips are used to get a better grip on the airsoft gun, flashlights (whether mounted or held in another hand) are used to illuminate dark areas and/or to blind opponents.\n\nEven though in certain countries lasers are illegal, they are popular attachments in the U.S. and Europe. Laser sights are more for their appearance than any practical effect, largely because they must be weak enough not to carry a risk of damaging another player's eyesight, which rules out using any laser powerful enough to produce a visible dot on the target in sunlight (although lasers can be useful for night games).\n\nAirsoft technology is used in military training and law enforcement training. Due to airsoft's realism, relatively safe projectiles, and economical ammunition, it is well-suited to war games and scenarios to train troops. Multiple airsoft inventions were developed originally for military and law enforcement use.\n\nMarking rounds were invented by Kerry T. Bowden to allow trainees to see where each projectile landed. Much like paintball and simunitions, these marking pellets would break upon impact, marking the target with luminescent liquid. Unlike traditional plastic pellets, marking rounds are heavier to ensure breakage of the shell on impact. The weight can be adjusted by adding heavier liquid. Marking rounds are critical for trainees because they allow the shooter to see exactly where they hit the target. This allows them to extrapolate their mistakes and improve their aim.\n\nReusable grenades were improved by Scott Frank to emulate the fragmentation of a real grenade in war games and scenarios. The grenade can be loaded with paint or pellets. It uses a quick release of highly pressurized gas to break the shell and quickly disperse pellets or paint in all directions. Frank's grenade, although not the first, aimed to be as realistic and predictable as an actual grenade. He developed a more accurate timing mechanism and secondary safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. Both marking rounds and reusable grenades gave airsoft the edge it needed to enter into military and law enforcement training grounds.\n\nThe airsoft guns used for training differ from civilian models. Guns manufactured for professional training are made to replicate the weight, feel and the sound of its real steel counterpart. In general, professional training airsoft guns are GBB models and enhanced with a weighted blowback mechanism to increase the force of the kick. Some are AEG's and are built with a blowback mechanism. They are also outfitted with muzzle protectors that amplify the sound to a decibel level comparable to that of a real firearm. The average FPS for professional training airsoft guns is higher than civilian models. Economically, airsoft is cheaper than simulation training. Benjamin Kratz, Fort Jackson's battalion executive officer, said that one blank M16 round can cost as much as 32 airsoft rounds. With decreasing military and law enforcement budgets, airsoft can allow for more practice hours.\n"}

Borås Arena has an artificial turf pitch, and was changed to the most modern synthetic turf on the market during the UEFA Euro 2012 at a cost of £500,000. The capacity of the arena is 14,500–17,800 depending on usage, 14,800 is mostly the capacity during international matches, due the fact that Uefa would not approve the installation of seats on the standing because of fire risk which means a lower capacity is needed to be approved by Uefa. Borås Arena is located next to Elfsborg's old home ground Ryavallen, both of the stadiums are built together at the roofs, which means that the new stadium is still attached to the old historical Ryavallen.\n\nThe first construction started on 31 December 2003 and was inaugurated April 17, 2005 at a cost of 1,120 000 £. Which was very cheap at this time considering to be Sweden's most modern stadium at that time. It was an effort by Borås Municipality that went out as a lender to Elfsborg. A necessary investment for the club and the city, Elfsborg would own their own stadium by the company Borås Arena AB and would receive all revenues without any intermediaries from matches. Borås Arena didn't only open a new era for IF Elfsborg but also for other clubs in Allsvenskan, Elfsborg was the first club to build a new arena owned by their own investment company. Many other clubs have built new arenas copying the model Elfsborg set up, trying to own their arena which gives big economic resources.

An explicit goal from the club was to win SM-Gold by 2007 and this was accomplished a year in advance, 5 November 2006. The association was strengthened at all levels for a couple of years, not least organizationally and financially, with new sports director \"Mr. Elfsborg\" Stefan Andreasson, President-elect Bosse \"Bank\" Johansson and two billionaires as external funders. The new highly skilled (and young) manager couple Magnus Haglund and Peter Wettergren, who was employed before the 2004 season, was also of course in the club's big bet. The following year (2005) was also \"Elfsborg Fortress\", Borås Arena, completed while enlisted old heroes in the form of Anders and Mathias Svensson came back. Memorable matches this season on Borås Arena was at home the victory against Malmö FF (4-2), which many described as the best in the season and where Anders Svensson made the teams single best effort during the season.

Concerns have been raised that snow may need to be transported to the venues at great cost and with uncertain environmental consequences.\n\nSome commentators alleged that one of the early promotional songs for the 2022 Winter Olympics, called \"The Snow and Ice Dance,\" has suspicious similarities with \"Let It Go.\" A Chinese media outlet cited technical analysis of the two songs: Both songs employ a piano as the major instrument, have similar prelude chords and an eight-beat introduction, and they run at almost exactly the same tempo.\n\nThe environmental impact of hosting the games near Beijing has been questioned. Some of the proposed venues will be adjacent to the Songshan National Nature Reserve and part of the same mountain system, and the environmental impact on the nature reserve of construction, and artificially covering parts of the mountain with snow, is uncertain.\n\nDomestic Chinese criticism and debate on the potential environmental impacts caused by the game are censored by the Chinese government on the press and internet.\n"}

{"id": "1899710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899710", "title": "Dirtsurfing", "text": "Dirtsurfing\n\nDirtsurfing is the sport of riding a Dirtsurfer brand inline board. This new Australian boardsport is correctly known as inline boarding because Dirtsurfer is a trademark protected brand name.\n\nA Dirtsurfer is composed of an aircraft aluminium tube frame, a laminate or composite deck and two 20in or 16in diameter BMX style bicycle wheels. Footstraps are (optionally) attached to the deck to give more control to the rider. The board is unique in that it incorporates a patented steering geometry where the front wheel pivots from a point in front of and below the axle of the wheel, via the 'Swingarm'. The rider's weight automatically centres and straightens the front wheel, creating stability and control.\nAnother feature of the Dirtsurfer which is not found on other four-wheeled boards is that, much like a bicycle, the stability actually increases with speed.\n\nInline Boarding was made an official race class by the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) and Gravity Sports International (GSI) in 2005. The 2005 IGSA World Cup Champion inline boarder is Nihat Uysal of Germany. Nihat rides the Silver GP-X (see below)\n\nThe first board was designated the GP (general purpose) and was available in black, red and blue colour options.\nInitially it was sold without brakes, which were later made standard as an addition to the existing frame, and utilised a retro fit \"calf lever\" operating system.\nA Limited Edition model was made of the GP, which offered a silver anodized frame, V rim wheels and a signed certificate and number.\n\nThe next board made available was the GP-X, which came with a silver anodized aluminium frame, blue anodized deep V rims, fully integrated calf brake with moulded plastic lever, increased ground clearance, disc brake caliper lugs on the frame, and disc hub on the rear wheel for easy conversion to disc brake use.\n\nTwo alternative versions to the GP-X were produced. The first, called the Road Racer, used the same frame as the GP-X in canary yellow powder coat finish, with black V rims and slick tyres.\nThe other was a UK specific beach racer model, with sealed bearing hubs, Black V rims, disc brake as standard, and beach tread tyres.\n\nIn 2003, Dirtsurfer introduced the Flexideck, a newer concept with an epoxy/fibreglass/maple composite deck connecting the front and rear frame to absorb jumps. Made available in powder coated lime green frame with purple anodized V rims, and disc brake as standard, it offered greatly increased ground clearance and a reinforced frame for jumping.\n\nDirtsurfer has updated their line-up with two new models for 2006: The Flexi Pro Downhill (DH), an updated Flexideck; and the all new Freestyle board (FS), a scaled down Flexideck with 16 inch wheels. Both models feature the new adjustable metal calf brake lever, rear disc brake, and new thermofibre deck. In addition to updating their flexideck boards, dirtsurfer also updated their line of General Purpose models (GP). Both are manufactured from HT steel. The new 16\" GP comes in white, with the new braking lever and disk brakes. The new GP 20\" come in black and also has the new braking handle and disk brakes.\n\nA unique feature of the Dirtsurfer is that it emulates the feel of carving as on a snowboard. This is achieved by the front wheel being mounted to a single pivoting point, allowing the axle of the wheel to be above the board. Think of the idea as being very similar to riding a bike that does not have handlebars and cannot independently create speed. A Dirtsurfer comes with a leg operated brake, either as a disc or a V-Brake as used on many bicycles.\n\nIt should be noted that the Dirtsurfer will never experience a speed wobble normally associated with other bikes or board sports. Because all of the weight is below the hub of the wheel and pulls down on the hub as opposed to pushing down actually changes physics.\n\nThe Dirtsurfer can be used as a downhill sport on or off-road, using just the power of gravity. The Dirtsurfer may also be \"skated\" in flat areas. \"Skating\" the Dirtsurfer means to push yourself forward with one foot while standing on the Dirtsurfer with the other foot the way you would a skateboard. Many Dirtsurfer riders also use a kite, sail or a kitewing, sometimes called wingsurfing to propel the Dirtsurfer in flat areas with adequate wind.\n\nThis discipline is similar to mountain biking, where the Dirtsurfer is ridden off-road down varying grades of tracks, from forest roads to technical singletrack.\n\nMany Dirtsurfer riders enjoy the fluid feel of carving down long asphalt roads, usually found in mountainous areas. High speeds at over 70 mph have been achieved, with riders limited only by turns in the road and their own sanity (and, to a lesser extent, speed limits). Boards are often modified with slick tyres for this purpose. Riders are often found wearing motorcycle leathers and full face helmets to try to prevent road rash in the event of an accident. An international race circuit has been growing since 2001 with major events held annually in Canada, the US, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Austria.\n\nDirtsurfing with a kite or kitewing is called wingsurfing and is performed on flat open spaces such as beaches or fields. Utilizing the wind, riders can achieve incredible air time and perform tricks that would otherwise require a massive ramp. It is even possible to ride uphill with sufficient wind. Unlike powerkiting with a mountain board, the Dirtsurfer is unidirectional; that is, it only goes one direction. However, it is possible, using the power of a kite or kitewing, to tack and gybe, much like a boat or windsurfer to change direction. Unlike a windsurfer however, it is not practical to change sides when coming to the end of a run in one direction. To overcome this, most riders can make the transition from \"heel-side\" to \"toe-side\". Riding toe-side means that your toes not your heels, point towards the floor as you lean forward into the wind, with your kitewing or kite behind you. This is not as difficult as it sounds. Due to the gyroscopic stability of the Dirtsurfer, speed is limited only by the wind, with recorded speeds well over 40 mph on a flat surface.\n\n"}

O'Donnell, a Harvard alumnus who played baseball and football while attending the school. It has a capacity of 1,600 spectators.\n\nThe land on which O'Donnell sits was donated to Harvard in 1890 by Major Henry Lee Higginson; Higginson named the site Soldier's Field after six of his friends who died fighting in the Civil War– James Savage, Jr., Charles Russell Lowell, Edward Barry Dalton, Stephen George Perkins, James Jackson Lowell, Robert Gould Shaw. At the site's dedication, Higginson said in an address to Harvard's students:\n\nThe Harvard baseball program moved to the location in 1898; from 1884–1897, it had played at Holmes Field, which Harvard also for football games and track & field competitions. On April 27, 1898, in the first game played on the field, Harvard defeated Dartmouth 13-7.\n\nPrior to a doubleheader against Dartmouth on May 4, 1997, the field was dedicated to Joseph J. O'Donnell, Harvard class of 1967. O'Donnell played baseball and football at Harvard, captaining the baseball team during his senior season. He donated $2.5 million to the baseball program in 1995, allowing it to hire a head coach on a full-time basis. In 2012, O'Donnell donated an additional $30 million to the university.\n\nThe 1998 Harvard team had a 15-0 record at O'Donnell Field and is the only team in program history to have an undefeated home record.\n\nThe field features a natural grass surface, bullpens, and shrubbery beyond the outfield fence. Bleacher seating is located behind home plate and on the first base side of the field. In 2004, a new backstop and dugouts were added to the field. Additionally, the height of the outfield fence was raised from three feet to four feet.\n\nHarvard Stadium stands next to the field on the first base side.\n\nThe field has hosted the baseball tournament of the summer Bay State Games on several occasions.

Construction began in 1968 and was completed in 1972. The Coliseum was officially closed on September 1, 2002, by Mayor John DeStefano, Jr., and demolished by implosion on January 20, 2007.\n\nThe arena's formal name was New Haven Veterans Memorial Coliseum, but most locals simply referred to it as \"New Haven Coliseum\". The Coliseum held 11,171 people at full capacity, and occupied 4.5 acres (18,000 m²) of land next to the Knights of Columbus Building and faced the Oak Street Connector/Route 34 downtown spur.\n\nThe Coliseum hosted the New Haven Knights of the United Hockey League, New Haven Nighthawks, New Haven Senators, and Beast of New Haven of the American Hockey League, as well as the 1984 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and Yale University's 2002 National Invitational Tournament men's college basketball tournament opening round games. Also, it was home of the Connecticut Coasters roller hockey team in 1993, the Connecticut Pride of the IBL from 2000 to 2001, and the New Haven Ninjas arenafootball2 team in 2002. Ice Capades has also been presented at the Coliseum. New Haven Coliseum was also second home to Yale University Hockey, playing games sporadically at the Coliseum over the years. The U.S.A. Women's Olympic Squad played an exhibition game vs. Sweden on December 15, 2001.\n\nNotably, in 1986, the Coliseum served as the setting for Van Halen's multi-platinum concert film \"Live Without a Net\". Many of the era's most prominent musical stars also appeared at the Coliseum.\n\nThe pilot episode of WWE SmackDown was filmed at the Coliseum on April 27, 1999, and aired on UPN two days later.\n\nTool was the final musical act on August 20, 2002.\n\nThe final event held at the Coliseum was a professional wrestling show held by World Wrestling Entertainment, one of the original attractions in the arena since 1972. The WWE considered the Coliseum its home arena, as it was—for much of its history—the closest venue to WWE's headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. Most matches were broadcast, first on WTNH, as well as on local UHF stations.\n\nThe Coliseum was built to replace the New Haven Arena, New Haven's prior indoor sports and entertainment venue. The Coliseum, as well as the neighboring Knights of Columbus building, was designed by the architect Kevin Roche of Roche-Dinkeloo. One interesting aspect of the arena's design was that the parking garage was built on top of the actual Coliseum structure; this was necessitated by a high water table in the area which made it overly difficult to construct sub-surface parking facilities. Though an interesting solution, this design was unpopular because of the quarter-mile helical ramps required to access the parking. Vincent Scully, the revered architectural historian at nearby Yale University, often referred to the design as \"Structural Exhibitionism\" in his modern architecture lectures. Other features of the design, such as street storefronts and an exhibition hall, were never completed.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the structure of the parking garages had deteriorated to the point where large canvas panels had to be attached to the outside to catch pieces of concrete that would occasionally drop off onto the sidewalk below. Renovations were made to correct that problem. The city shut down the facility in 2002 after concluding that it was a drain on city coffers. However, the city did not hold any public hearings, referendum votes, or conduct any surveys, and several groups, local stakeholders, and the Coalition to Save Our Coliseum mounted a campaign to save and renovate the Coliseum, to no avail. Others in the community supported the plan to demolish the arena. Despite Mayor DeStefano's plan to close and demolish the building within six months, it ultimately took more than four years.\n\nAmong the reasons for the Coliseum's demise was the construction or renovation (often with state money) in the 1990s of alternative comparably sized venues within the southern Connecticut market. The Arena at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport attracted a minor league hockey team, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. The Mohegan Sun Arena was built about an hour away, and became the home of the Connecticut Sun. Many musical acts started booking the Oakdale Theatre in the city of Wallingford, Connecticut after it was upgraded and expanded. Even though the state gave $5.5 million to the arena for new paint, signage, and scoreboards, the Coliseum simply could not compete with newer facilities. Even as early as 1980 the Coliseum was decried as a \"White Elephant\". Mayor DeStefano also had staked out a strategy of investing city resources into arts and cultural activities rather than attracting sports teams to the city.\n\nThe Coliseum's demolition was delayed by the state's refusal to award the $6.5 million that the city requested, and the arena remained empty and darkened. The office area was used in the meantime for practice by the New Haven Fire Department.\n\nActual demolition work began in late October 2005 with removal of most of the arena area. At 7:50 a.m. on January 20, 2007, after years of wrangling and delay, the Coliseum was finally imploded, using more than 2,000 pounds of explosive. It was said that the implosion could be heard all the way to Meriden and Northford. As it came down, a massive cloud of dust and smoke covered the surrounding area, but blew away quickly toward the shoreline. Upwards of 20,000 people watched from the nearby Temple Street Garage and other buildings, and residents of nearby apartments were evacuated. The two helical ramps were not imploded, and were subsequently destroyed by conventional methods.\n\nThe city has tentative plans to replace the Coliseum with a new downtown/Long Wharf redevelopment plan, including a relocated Long Wharf Theatre and a new campus for Gateway Community College.\n\nA temporary 400-space parking lot opened on the former Coliseum site on December 4, 2007, but plans are advancing to redevelop the site with a hotel, hundreds of housing units and approximately 40,000 sq. feet of commercial space. The master developer, LiveWorkLearnPlay had the project approved in 2013, but construction has been delayed due to cost issues related to the moving of utilities and conflicts related to planned highway improvements.\n\nOn January 12, 2009 the Knights of Columbus filed a lawsuit against the City of New Haven, Stamford Wrecking Company and Demolition Dynamics Company. The lawsuit seeks repayment for damages incurred to the Knights of Columbus Building and Knights of Columbus Museum across the street from the Coliseum.\n\n\n"}

Originally the statement \"60% of NBA players go bankrupt within five years after leaving their sport\" was released by a representative of the NBA Players' Association in 2008 A \"Fortune\" magazine article states, however, that a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the percentage of NFL players who go bankrupt after two years is a much smaller 1.9%, climbing to 15.7% after 12 years.\n\n the average salary for the about 500 players in Major League Baseball was slightly more than $2,000 a season ($ today). The star hitter Ty Cobb received $9,000 a season ($ today), and sold automobiles in the off season. While Cobb encouraged young men to play professionally, top pitcher Christy Mathewson—who had made more money as a player than Cobb—warned, \"Keep out of baseball unless you are sure of being a star!\" He stated that the average player did not make enough over a ten-year career to justify devoting those years to the sport.\n\nBy 1941, Hank Greenberg was the highest-paid player in baseball, earning $55,000 a season ($ today). Stan Musial's $80,000 a season ($ today) was the highest in 1952, while young star Mickey Mantle earned $10,000 a season ($ today). Musial, like Cobb, supplemented his income; he owned a restaurant.\n\nBaseball outfielder Torii Hunter brought up another obstacle: \"Once you get into the financial stuff, and it sounds like Japanese, guys are just like, 'I ain't going back.' They're lost.\" It has been often suggested that baseball players study finance in college so that they can understand basic finances and contracts.\n\nPlayers encourage each other to spend lavishly. Rod Strickland explained, \"For rookies, it's like an unspoken initiation ... You're trying to get in good with the veterans, so you go beyond your means.\" Friends and strangers become part of their entourages. Retired basketball center Danny Schayes stated, \"Guys go broke because they surround themselves with people who help them go broke\".\n\nAn additional problem is that players can earn money in many different tax jurisdictions, and be a citizen of one country but a legal resident of another.\n\n\"There's a far shorter peak earnings period than in any other profession\". \"Black Enterprise\" reported in 2003 that \"the average career span for professional basketball, football, and baseball is a mere 4.5 years, 3.2 years, and under five years, respectively.\" A 2007 study found that, excluding pitchers, rookie Major League Baseball players' careers last for 5.6 years on average.\n\nMagic Johnson said, \"They hire these people not because of expertise but because they're friends. Well, they'll fail.\" Rod Strickland made his father his business manager. The older Strickland checked out a real estate deal from a \"friend of a close friend\" of Rod's, but not well enough to avoid a costly blunder.\n\nHockey Hall of Famer Bobby Orr received deceitful treatment from Alan Eagleson, who \"as Orr's agent, left him all but broke as part of one of sports' most spectacular financial scandals.\"\n\nKarl Malone, another Basketball Hall of Famer has said, \"You get in trouble when you let a lot of people close to you . . . I've made my share of mistakes. You've got to learn from them.\n\nWhen asked by one of his players \"What's the most dangerous thing that could happen to us financially?\", Carolina Panthers majority owner Jerry Richardson replied immediately, \"Divorce.\" The money stops flowing in. Without a prenuptial agreement, Michael Jordan's $168 million divorce settlement was at the time the largest ever. On the other hand, Dikembe Mutombo canceled his wedding, when his fiancee refused to sign one the day before the ceremony.\n\nAnother factor is the sexual opportunities available to athletes during their careers. Players end up being responsible for child support. Shawn Kemp had at least seven children with six women, Derrick Thomas seven with five, Jon Kilgore fifteen with four, and Travis Henry nine with nine. Henry was imprisoned for non-payment of an estimated $170,000 annually.\n\nThe National Football League offers its players a Financial Education Program. \"The non-credit seminars are offered during the year and teach players about cash management, insurance, tax planning, retirement planning and other related topics.\" There is also a more advanced NFL Business Management and Entrepreneurial Program, with \"custom programs at top-rated business schools\".\n\nRyerson University's Ted Rogers School of Management offers a program called Breakaway, which aims to help players in their transition away from professional hockey and other sports.\n\nEducation can often be overlooked by professional athletes, once they have made it to their desired sports league. This is a major concern because many professional athletes have no funds or career options to fall back on. Without a college degree, higher education, or in some instances even a high school diploma; there are limited options to explore in the world outside of athletics. Well established athletes like Shaquille O'Neal and Ray Lewis have gone back to receive their college degrees, despite their incredible success in their respected athletic professions. One side of the argument says that college athletics and the educational institutions often do not succeed in accommodating their student athletes for their future endeavors outside of sports, and that the overall relationship between schools and athletes can be perceived as commercial, rather than educational.\n\nIn college athletics, such as basketball and football, coaches appear to control athletes in and out of season of their respected sport. With incredibly demanding schedules that almost always requires players to miss classes to focus on their athletic performance, one side of the argument is that it can be difficult to state that schools implement policies and coaches that respect athletics and education equally at a university. Universities have been able to counter these arguments by complying with NCAA rules on limits of practice time and extracurricular activities for the sport that do not pertain to the classroom. Universities often argue that not only do these athletes receive an opportunity of a higher education that they might not have necessarily been able to receive, but that these skills enhance competitive drive, discipline, and teamwork skills in future work settings. Scholarships often provide opportunities for those who may not have gotten into a university, based on previous academic performance or financial status, have been the one of the central arguments for universities justifying their athletic standing and policies. Additional arguments now cite the importance of the synergies in the valuable knowledge and experience gained on the field and how these skills are applied in the workplace. In a study done about the mean attribution of life skills to the sport experience, 75% of former athletes who were participants stated that there were major life skills associated with sports that transferred to their working lives. This study analyzed different types of experiential learning, and found that these were often experiential skills that were learned through playing sports that included what ranged from leadership to goal setting. These arguments may more commonly come up to defend universities for implementing high standards in athletic performance. Regardless of these allegations against universities, education is extremely valuable to professional athletes because the average athlete rarely has a long tenure and cannot make their income last for a sustained period of time.\n\nSome believe that the universities are not to blame, and that students often pave their own path. In a survey consisting of previous student athletes, athletic performance and effort was attributed to helping the development of major life skills, especially in the work force. However, this can change from person to person, and social theorists even believe that roles and identities contribute heavily to where a person is headed in life. There are some athletes, whose personality caters to working incredibly hard on the field, rather than off the field, thus developing more of an athletic identity that can get in the way of a career path or education. The same goes with those who have passions in education or some other activity, making student athletes think very differently from one another.\n\nBasketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson is an example of an athlete who has not only kept his money, but increased it. He has built a thriving business empire. He was at one time a part owner of the Los Angeles Lakers, and his company, Magic Johnson Enterprises, has a net worth of $700 million. In 2012, he was a minority partner in a group that bought the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nMichael Jordan has proven almost as successful in his post-basketball business ventures, despite a temporary financial setback due to his divorce. He has numerous business interests, most notably his own line of apparel through Nike. In March 2010, he became the majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, now known as the Charlotte Hornets, after buying out most of the interest of founding owner Bob Johnson for $275 million.\n\nAnother Hall of Famer, Dave Bing, established a steel processing company, Bing Steel, in Detroit in 1980. After Bing Steel suffered a loss in its first year of operation, Bing decided to shift his company from manufacturing to being a middleman. Bing Steel became profitable in its second year of operation, and has since expanded to become the Bing Group, a conglomerate involved in a number of businesses, including supplying the automotive industry. However, it has been recently announced that the Bing Group is heavily in debt and is in process of being sold. Most of his holdings have either gone bankrupt or been dissolved.\n\nStill another Hall of Famer, Karl Malone, was involved in a substantial number of business ventures during his NBA career, with his involvement both expanding and diversifying since his retirement. A 2012 story in the \"Deseret News\" of Salt Lake City, where he played almost all of his NBA career, listed his current ventures. Among these are new-car and used-car dealerships in the Salt Lake City area; a cattle ranch and substantial timber property in his home state of Louisiana; restaurants in Louisiana, Utah and Idaho; a commercial development company; a deer-raising venture; and an outfitting business.\n\nHall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan has proven successful in business, though not at the level of Johnson or Jordan. After the end of his playing career in 1993, he was majority owner and chairman of a bank in his home town of Alvin, Texas before selling his interest in 2005. He also became part owner of two minor-league teams in his home state, the Corpus Christi Hooks and Round Rock Express. In 2010, he was the public face of, and a minority investor in, a group that bought the Texas Rangers, the team with which he finished his Major League Baseball playing career. He owned a controlling interest in the team until late 2013, when he sold his stake after differences with the majority partners of the Rangers.\n\nFormer Washington Redskins cornerback Eugene Profit parlayed his Yale economics education into a highly successful financial career. His company, Profit Investment Management, looks after $2 billion in assets. Former Denver Broncos quarterback and Pro Football Hall of Fame member John Elway used his football earnings to launch a chain of automotive dealerships and steakhouses.\n\nAnother athlete turned successful businessman, at least for a time, was former football safety Dave Duerson, president and CEO of Duerson Foods L.L.C. However, an expansion of his company turned into financial disaster due to issues with a supplier of freezers for a meat processing plant. Duerson Foods won a $34 million judgment against the freezer company in 2004, but never collected because the company later filed for bankruptcy, and Duerson himself filed for bankruptcy in September 2010. Duerson's story turned far more tragic, as he committed suicide in February 2011, and a post-mortem examination of his brain revealed he was suffering from what was described as a \"moderately advanced\" case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, presumably from constant blows to the head during his football career.\n\nVince Young – After earning $45 million in salary and endorsements, Young is one of the most recent pro athletes to go broke.\n\nAntoine Walker – Despite earning $108 million in salary while playing in the NBA, Walker had to declare bankruptcy in 2010 listing assets of $5 million and debts of $13 million thanks to bad real estate investments and gambling debts.\n\nEvander Holyfield – After earning $250 million as a heavyweight champion, in 2008 a bank foreclosed on Holyfield's $10 million, 54,000 square foot, 109 room Atlanta mansion.\n\nKenny Anderson – Despite earning $63 million in salary, Anderson was broke the day he left the NBA. After filing for bankruptcy, Anderson became a K-12 school teacher.\n\nWarren Sapp – In April 2012, Sapp filed for bankruptcy claiming assets worth $6.5 million and debts of $7 million. The $7 million is owed to the IRS, child support to four different women, and medical bills.\n\nAllen Iverson – In February 2012, Iverson told a Georgia judge that he was flat broke and could not pay an $860k jewelry debt. Iverson earned $154 million in salary and $30–50 million in endorsements during his career. Iverson was known to travel with a 50-person entourage, lost millions of dollars gambling, lavished friends with expensive gifts and had massive monthly child support obligations.\n\nMike Tyson - earned an estimated $400 million over his career, but declared bankruptcy in 2003.\n\nSheryl Swoopes earned an estimated $50 million playing basketball, and declared bankruptcy in 2004, owing $711,050. Swoopes admitted, \"I didn't surround myself with the right people. I got in a position where it was like, 'Oh, wow, what happened?'\"\n\nFormer Boston Red Sox star Jack Clark filed for bankruptcy in the middle of his $8.7-million-dollar contract.\n"}

{"id": "1747303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1747303", "title": "Serve and volley", "text": "Serve and volley\n\nServe and volley is a style of play in tennis where the player serving moves quickly towards the net after hitting a serve. The server then attempts to hit a volley (a shot where the ball is struck without allowing it to bounce), as opposed to the baseline style, where the server stays back following the serve and attempts to hit a groundstroke (a shot where the ball is allowed to bounce before contact is made). The serve and volley style of play has diminished in recent years with advances in racquet and string technologies which allow players to generate a great amount of top spin on groundstrokes and passing shots. The slowing of court surfaces and deflation of balls, promoting longer rallies for the enjoyment of spectators, has also put a damper on the serve and volley style. Some also claim that a lack of teaching of the serve and volley to juniors, who are too small to effectively employ this method, has caused it to become obsolete in grassroots tennis.\n\nThe aim of this strategy is to put immediate pressure on the opponent with the intent of ending points quickly. Good returns must be made, or else the server can gain the advantage. This tactic is especially useful on fast courts (e.g. grass courts) and less so on slow courts (e.g. clay courts). For it to be successful, the player must either have a good serve to expose an opponent's poor return or be exceptionally quick and confident in movement around the net to produce an effective returning volley. Ken Rosewall, for instance, had a very feeble serve but was a very successful serve-and-volley player for two decades. Goran Ivanišević, on the other hand, had success employing the serve-and-volley strategy with great serves and average volleys.\n\nServe-and-volley is thought to have been invented by the Australian Norman Brookes. Although earlier tennis greats such as Bill Tilden, Ellsworth Vines, and Don Budge had been noted for their fine serves and net games, they had not played a 100% serve-and-volley style game. Jack Kramer in the late 1940s was the first world-class player to consistently come to the net after every serve, including his second serve. Kramer writes, however, in his 1979 autobiography, that it was Bobby Riggs, his opponent in the 1948 Pro tennis tour who began the strategy: \"When we first started touring he came at me on his first serve, on his second serve, and on my second serve... my second serve didn't kick like Bobby's, so he could return that deep enough and follow into the net... It forced me to think attack constantly. I would rush in and try to pound his weakest point -- his backhand. So the style I am famous for was not consciously planned: it was created out of the necessity of dealing with Bobby Riggs.\"\n\nIn the mid-1950s, when Pancho Gonzales was dominating professional tennis with his serve-and-volley game, occasional brief attempts were made to partially negate the power of his serve. This, it was felt, would lead to longer rallies and more spectator interest. At least three times the rules were modified:\n\n\nOther male tennis players known for their serve-and-volley technique include Pancho Segura, Frank Sedgman, Lew Hoad, Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, John McEnroe, Stefan Edberg, Pat Cash, Boris Becker, Patrick Rafter, Pete Sampras and Tim Henman. Sampras, despite being known for his great serve and volley game, did not always come to the net behind the serve on slower courts, particularly on the second serve. This was especially the case when he was younger.\n\nThe serve-and-volley strategy has traditionally been less common amongst female players. An early pioneer in women's volleying was Elizabeth Ryan, who was at the top of the women's game in the mid-to-late 1920s. But it was later on that serve and volley caught on in women's game. The style propelled Margaret Court to become the all-time leader in Grand Slam titles (24 in singles, 62 total). Martina Navratilova and Jana Novotná later became players well known for their serve-and-volley style. More recently, players such as Martina Hingis, Justine Henin, and Amélie Mauresmo were willing to come to the net, with Henin and Mauresmo playing a very heavy serve and volley style and volleying in general match during the 2006 Wimbledon Finals. Later in her career Henin was also known for serving and volleying on set and match points, such as on Championship point at the 2007 US Open Final against Svetlana Kuznetsova.\n\nAlthough the strategy has become less common in both the men's and women's game, a few players still prefer to come in on their serves. It is also commonly used as a surprise tactic. Notable examples are Roger Federer, Feliciano López, Nicolas Mahut, Rajeev Ram, Gilles Müller, Radek Štěpánek, Ivo Karlović, Dustin Brown, Pierre-Hugues Herbert, Sergiy Stakhovsky, Sam Groth, Łukasz Kubot, Leander Paes, and Mischa Zverev. The frequent use of serve-and-volley strategy enabled Zverev to upset 3-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray at the 2017 Australian Open.\n\nOn the women's side, serve-and-volley has become almost extinct at the very top level. Roberta Vinci and Hsieh Su-wei are the only notable (WTA elite) players that prefer to play with this style.\n\nBill Tilden, the dominant player of the 1920s and one of the fathers of the \"cannonball\" serve, nevertheless preferred to play from the backcourt and liked nothing better than to face an opponent who threw powerful serves and groundstrokes at him and who rushed the net — one way or another Tilden would find a way to hit the ball past him. Tilden may also have spent more time analyzing the game of tennis than anyone before or since. His book \"Match Play and the Spin of the Ball\" (1925) is still in print and is the definitive work on the subject. In it, Tilden states that a perfect baseline player will always beat a perfect serve-and-volleyer 6-0 because his returns of service will be winning passing shots; however he also states that of course neither such a player can exist. Tilden used this style of play for many years.\n\nSome of the most interesting matches of all time according to Pat Cash have pitted great baseliners such as Björn Borg or Andre Agassi against great serve-and-volleyers such as Stefan Edberg, John McEnroe or Pat Rafter. Since Tilden's time, head-to-head results on various surfaces, such as those played out in the famous rivalry between Borg and McEnroe, contradict his theory that great baseline players will tend to defeat great serve-and-volley ones.\n\nAnother perspective on the serve-and-volley game is that it is less tiring than playing constantly from the backcourt. Kramer says in his autobiography that he and Pancho Segura once tried playing three matches in which they allowed the ball to bounce three times before either could approach the net. \"I don't believe I could have played tennis the way Segoo and I did for the three nights because it wore me out, running down all those groundstrokes. It was much more gruelling than putting a lot into a serve and following it in.\" He goes on to say that \"Rosewall was a backcourt player when he came into the pros, but he learned very quickly how to play the net. Eventually, for that matter, he became a master of it, as much out of physical preservation as for any other reason. I guarantee you that Kenny wouldn't have lasted into his forties as a world-class player if he hadn't learned to serve and volley.\"\n\nDespite the improvements in racquet technology made towards the end of the twentieth century which made serve-and-volley a rarer tool in a tennis player's skill set, players familiar with the strategy still advocate it. Roger Federer advocated up-and-coming players not to ignore the tactic's strategy of coming to the net, especially on faster surfaces and as a surprise tactic . Yet other players, such as Mischa Zverev, acknowledged the difficulty of mastering serve-and-volley, recalling his 36-month effort to adopt the style. As he put it: \"Every point, you have to be ready. You're either going to get passed, you're going to miss an easy volley or you're going to win the point,\" and likened it to the stochastic nature of flipping a coin.\n"}

It stars Tom Guiry, Mike Vitar, Karen Allen, Denis Leary and James Earl Jones. The filming locations were in Midvale, Salt Lake City, and Ogden, Utah.\n\nIt grossed $33 million worldwide and has become a cult film.\n\nIn the San Fernando Valley during the summer of 1962, Scotty Smalls is the new boy in the neighborhood, seeking desperately to fit in. He would be welcomed on the local sandlot baseball team that practices every day, which only has eight players. His mother encouraged to make friends this summer. Smalls, however, cannot play baseball; on his first visit to the sandlot he finds himself in the outfield with a fly ball descending toward him which bounces off his glove, causing the other boys, except Benny \"the Jet\" Rodriguez, the team's leader, to burst out laughing. Smalls, humiliated, leaves the baseball field.\n\nSmalls asks his stepfather to teach him to play, and while his stepdad agrees, Scott cannot successfully catch or throw the ball. Benny soon teaches him what he needs to know, and with Benny's support, he gets a place on the team.\n\nMeanwhile, behind a wall at the end of the sandlot is a backyard inhabited by \"the Beast\", an English Mastiff so large and savage that it has become a neighborhood legend. One day, the boys' last ball lands in the Beast's backyard. Smalls attempts to retrieve it, but the others, knowing about the Beast, stop him. That evening, they tell him all about the Beast, and that his owner, Mr. Mertle, got him when he was just a puppy when thieves were plaguing his junkyard, Mertle's Acres. After a couple of weeks, the puppy became the Beast; he grew enormous and aggressive, killing and devouring the thieves, bones and all. Eventually, Squints' grandfather, who was the police chief at the time, had Mr. Mertle chain up the Beast in the backyard and keep him under his house forever. Smalls also learns that many baseballs end up in the backyard, and then they just disappear.\n\nThe next day, at a local swimming pool, Squints pretends to drown so that he can kiss the lifeguard, Wendy Peffercorn, whom he has a crush on. She does not take too kindly to it, and they are banned from the pool. Nonetheless, she realizes that Squints has feelings for her.\n\nOne day, Benny busts the guts out of their baseball and Smalls steals his stepfather's ball. After that ball also ends up with the Beast, Smalls discovers the ball was special; it was signed by Babe Ruth. Smalls' stepfather has gone to Chicago for a week-long business trip, putting Smalls and the others on a race against time to recover the ball before he returns. They make many attempts to retrieve the ball, but the Beast thwarts each attempt. One night, Benny has a dream in which Babe Ruth gives him advice, and Benny explains to him about the Beast, saying that he ate one kid who hopped the fence and went into Mr. Mertle's backyard.\n\nThe next day, Benny puts on PF Flyers, shoes \"guaranteed\" to make a kid run faster and jump higher, and goes into Mr. Mertle's backyard, despite protests from his team. Benny retrieves the ball, but the Beast breaks his chain and escapes, chasing Benny through the streets, a theater, a picnic, the local swimming pool and eventually back to the sandlot. Mr. Mertle's fence falls on top of the Beast, but Smalls and Benny manage to get the fence off him; he shows the kids that he has been keeping all the baseballs they hit into the backyard in a small hole. Smalls and Benny then meet Mr. Mertle, who reveals that the Beast's real name is Hercules, an English Mastiff, and that he knew Babe Ruth, because he was also a baseball player who went blind after getting hit by a baseball. Mr. Mertle trades the destroyed Babe Ruth-autographed baseball for a baseball signed by all of the 1927 New York Yankees, which Smalls gives to his stepfather as a gift to make up for the other ball.\n\nThe sandlot boys enjoy the rest of the summer and the next few years, with the Beast as their mascot. Over the next three decades, the boys grow up and go into different careers. Benny and Smalls remain close; Benny becomes a famous MLB player, while Smalls becomes a sportscaster.\n\n\"The Sandlot\" has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The film currently holds a 56% \"rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 48 reviews. The site's consensus says \"It may be shamelessly derivative and overly nostalgic, but \"The Sandlot\" is nevertheless a genuinely sweet and funny coming-of-age adventure.\" Critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, comparing the movie to a summertime version of \"A Christmas Story\", based on the tone and narration of both films: Bob Cannon of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a B+, praising its simplicity and strong fundamentals.\n\nLeonard Klady of \"Variety\" gave the film a mostly negative review. He praised the cinematography and score, but felt the baseball team did not come together, and that the film, while sincere, was a \"remarkably shallow wade, rife with incident and slim on substance.\"\n\nThe film grossed $4 million in its opening weekend and a further $32 million through ticket sales. Figures for worldwide VHS and DVD sales are estimated to be at $76 million. Since its release on both VHS and DVD, the film has become a cult favorite. \n\nIn 1998, Michael Polydoros sued 20th Century Fox and the producers of the film for defamation. Polydoros, a childhood classmate of David Mickey Evans, the author and director of \"The Sandlot\", claimed that the character Michael \"Squints\" Palledorous was derogatory and caused him shame and humiliation. The trial court found in favor of the filmmakers, and that finding was affirmed by the California Court of Appeal. After initially agreeing to review the case in 1998, the Supreme Court of California reversed its decision, dismissing the review and reinstating the Court of Appeal's opinion in favor of 20th Century Fox.\n\nIn 1993, \"The Sandlot\" first came to video in a slipcase, along with the LaserDisc in widescreen, but later came in a clam shell case in 1994. On January 29, 2002, the DVD came in a \"Family Feature\", in widescreen (Side B) and full screen (Side A). The 2013 repackaged DVD is only in widescreen. On March 26, 2013, the film released on Blu-ray for the first time to celebrate its 20th anniversary. The film then had a re-release on Blu-ray and Digital HD on March 27, 2018 as part of the film's 25th anniversary.\n\n\nThe film's original score was composed by David Newman, and was not released until 2006, when a limited edition was released as part of the Varèse Sarabande CD Club.\n\n"}

Started in 1853 by Colonel Richard Henry Dulany, the show was designed to showcase and improve local breeding stock in Northern Virginia. Colonel Dulany continued to run the show until his death in 1906. The show has occupied the same scenic spot since its inception 155 years ago; under the shady oak trees of Grafton Farm, near Upperville, Virginia.\n\nAccording to historians, Colonel Dulany was riding cross-country one cold winter's day and came across a young colt who was cast in a low fence. Stopping to free the young horse, he realized the colt had been stuck long enough for his feet to have frozen. Reflecting on the fate of the young horse, Colonel Dulany decided to start a colt & filly show to encourage better care of young horses, and to inspire local breeders to breed better stock.\n\nThe show was scheduled for June under the oak trees at Grafton Farm, a centrally located Dulany farm on route 50 two miles east of Upperville. The first show listed two classes, one for colts, and one for fillies. Prior to the first show, Colonel Dulany went to Manhattan to consult with silversmith Louis Tiffany to design a suitable trophy, the labor on which was donated by Mr. Tiffany for the event. The first show proved so popular, a club was formed to run the show. The club, originally called the Upperville Union Club, elected Colonel Dulany as its first president.\n\nThe AA rated show, considered one of the most prestigious in the country, now spans seven days and showcases over two thousand horse and rider combinations. It was named the \"Horse Show of the Year\" by the National Show Hunter Hall of Fame and the Virginia Horse Show Association. The prize list includes classes in breeding, hunters, and jumpers, and entries range from local children to leading Olympic and Show Jumping World Cup horses and riders.\n\nThe show attracts over 20,000 spectators and finishes with the popular $100,000 Budweiser Grand Prix on the final Sunday.\n\n"}
