It was founded in 1971 by a dedicated group of volunteers and ski enthusiasts. Shortly thereafter, in 1975 the museum was incorporated. Since 2011 it has left the Ottawa location with collection online or stored.\n\nThe museum's founders recognized the rapid expansion and development of the sport of skiing over the years; this inspired them to collect not only the material and artifacts related to skiing, but also the various stories associated with the early years. These artifacts and stories remain to be the foundation from which the museum has built its world-class collection.\n\nUpon the museum's opening, Herman 'Jackrabbit' Smith-Johannsen acted as the Patron of the Canadian Ski Museum, and donated several of his prize possessions to the collection. Within the museum exhibit is an area devoted to 'Jackrabbit', the protagonist and practitioner of cross country and wilderness skiing who lived and breathed skiing for 111 years of his legendary life.\n\nThe Canadian Ski Museum's unparalleled collection of artifacts and archival holdings are a priceless part of Canadian cultural heritage. Since the Museum's beginnings, the collection has continued to grow, and the presentations of displays and stories about the history of skiing in Canada have increased. The museum has an incredible collection of photographs, memorabilia, skis, poles and ski clothing donated by skiers, all devoted to preserving the memory of Canada's skiing past.\n\nAt present, volunteers supported by a small paid staff, carry out the Museum's activities. The Museum relies on the support of friends and donors to continue to preserve and present Canadian Ski Heritage.\n\nThe Canadian Ski Museum established the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame in 1982 . Since the creation of the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame over 140 people have been inducted. The Canadian Ski Hall of Fame honours the pioneers, competitors, builders and industry personnel that have contributed significantly to Canada's skiing/snowboarding heritage.\n\nThe Canadian Ski Museum is a registered Canadian Charity and governed by a Board of Directors, operating through the Chair of the Board and an Executive Committee. The Canadian Ski Museum is recognized by the Fédération Internationale de Ski (\"FIS\") the International Ski Federation.\n\n\n\n"}

While the vast majority of cyclists worldwide wear conventional clothing while riding, a jersey offers certain advantages for the sport-oriented cyclist. A cycling jersey is cut long in the back to accommodate the bent-over position used in sport-oriented cycling. Any pockets on the jersey are placed on the back panel as front pockets would tend to spill. The zipper is often made very long so that the cyclist can open up the jersey to allow for ventilation. The cycling jersey is usually worn with a tight fit in order to reduce air resistance. Jerseys are made from a material designed to wick moisture from the skin, keeping the cyclist cooler and more comfortable.\n\nProfessional cycling is heavily sponsored; the traditional cycling jersey is printed with the logos of a few of the cycling team's sponsors.\n\nJerseys symbolising race positions include the yellow jersey, or \"maillot jaune\", from the Tour de France, the pink jersey, or \"maglia rosa\", from the Giro d'Italia, and the red jersey, or \"la roja,\" from the Vuelta de Espana. The first two jerseys were given the same color as the paper their original main sponsors (both sports newspapers) were printed on: yellow and pink paper, respectively.

It was opened on 25 May 1938 and named after former club president Antonio Vespucio Liberti. It is the largest stadium in Argentina with a capacity of 66,266 and is also home of the Argentina national football team. It was the main venue in the 1951 Pan American Games. It hosted the 1978 FIFA World Cup Final between Argentina and the Netherlands. Additionally, it hosted four finals of the Copa América, most recently in 2011.\n\nThe Club Atlético River Plate was founded in 1901 and by 1934, it had won two championships. At the time, the club was nicknamed \"Los Millonarios\" (\"The Millionaires\" in Spanish) because of the purchase of forward Carlos Peucelle for whom River had paid a huge amount of money. On October 31, 1934, River Plate purchased the land where the club was to build the new stadium in the neighborhood of Belgrano.\n\nEl Monumental was built on land reclaimed from the marshy coast of Río de la Plata. On May 25, 1935, the cornerstone was laid on the Centennial (now Figueroa Alcorta) and Río de la Plata (Udaondo) Avenues. On December 1 of that year, the Steering Committee presented the approved project in detail to its members at an assembly. They obtained a loan of $2,500,000 from the government and on September 27, 1936, construction began under the direction of architects José Aslan and Héctor Ezcurra.\n\nThe initial cost of work reached the figure of $4,479,545.80, but was reduced to about 3 million dollars when the committee decided to halt the construction of the north end of the stadium due to a lack of adequate funds.\n\nThe foundation of the stadium was to be six or eight feet deep. This required open pit excavation to ensure the stability of the ground, and pumping bilge water from the site. The construction of the three stands was completed in two years. There are 50 km of steps, with 26,000 square meters of reinforced concrete and almost 3,000 tons of steel.\n\nThe stadium was inaugurated on Wednesday 25 May, amidst a crowd of approximately 65,000 people. They witnessed the handing over of an Argentine flag, one from the club, paid for by a group of associates, and then sang the national anthem and the River Plate chant.\n\nThe next day, nearly 68,000 spectators were present. After various activities the evening ended with a match between River Plate and Uruguay team Peñarol, with a 3–1 victory for the home squad.\n\nIn the 2016-17 league season, River Plate drew an average home attendance of 37,000, the second-highest in the league.\n\nWhen the Monumental project was originally designed, it consisted of four double decker stands. As the bank loan was not enough to carry out the entire project, the stadium was left with a horseshoe shape. The horseshoe was partially enclosed in 1958, under the club presidency of Enrique Pardo. The new construction, the first tier Colonia stand, was financed by proceeds from the 10M pesos transfer of Omar Sivori to Juventus of Italy. With the new construction the stadium's capacity reached 90,000.\n\nThe stadium was remodelled and finally completed to meet the original project after Argentina was awarded the right to host the 1978 World Cup. River Plate was lent money by the Military Government in charge of the country at the time but they struggled to meet repayments due to the changes of currency, which had a detrimental effect on the team. Monumental was the headquarters for the 1978 World Cup. The venue was opened on June 1 for the match between West Germany and Poland. They hosted seven more games, including the final between Argentina and the Netherlands.\n\nSan Lorenzo earned the record for highest number of people attending a match for a visiting team in 1982. In their second division match against Tigre, San Lorenzo (which did not have a stadium at the time), brought more than 70,000 people to River's stadium. In 1975 when River played Racing for the title (after an 18 years drought) 100,000 were present. At the end of the 1986 and 1996 Copa Libertadores second-leg finals (both against América de Cali), more seats were added and approximately 86,000 spectators were in attendance. It is estimated that for the Argentina versus Uruguay 1987 Copa América semifinal more than 87,000 spectators attended. In 1993, in a qualification match for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Argentina lost 5–0 to Colombia, its greatest ever defeat at home. Since then, however, Argentina had never lost a match in World Cup qualifying within this stadium until Ecuador won 2-0 on October 8, 2015.\n\nThe total length of the seating in the stands of the stadium is over 70 kilometers.\n\nThe stadium served as venue for the following matches during the World Cup:\n\nThe \"Monumental\", aside from being River Plate's home ground, also accommodates the Argentine National Football Team in their home games for events such as the FIFA World Cup qualification.\nThe Monumental also hosted the closing ceremonies and the athletics events of the First Pan American Games in 1951.\n\nThe stadium host the first Super Special Stage of the 2007 Rally Argentina of WRC.\n\nRugby union matches featuring the Argentina national rugby union team, \"Los Pumas\", also take place occasionally on this field, although the \"Pumas\" more frequently play at other stadiums.\n\nWhen an international performing artist or band visits Buenos Aires, the concerts are usually held in this stadium, as it is the biggest in the city and in all of Argentina.\n\nThe stadium played host to Amnesty International's final Human Rights Now!

The club play in the Football Superleague of Kosovo, which is the top tier of football in the country.\n\nIn 1947, Drita was founded by the Gjilan citizens, the name Drita means light in Albanian language and the name was taken from other sports clubs from the city. The first club footballers trained under extraordinary circumstances and in difficult conditions, without food, just to succeed. They testified their talent with their inescapable will. From the beginning it was a snag of the communist government because it rivaled the other team of the city, their favorite, Crvena Zvezda Gnjilane and because the founders and footballers were only Albanians and had an Albanian name. Therefore, in 1952 the team is extinguished by the regime. Former footballers went to the already multi-ethnic team of Zvezda, but the team didn't completely get erased. They competed in the Kosovo Province League where they were declared champions in the 1962–63 season..\n\nIn 1991. At the time of the dissolution of Yugoslavia. the football of Kosovo was in its zenith and consistently had 4-5 clubs in both federal leagues. But the deterioration of the political situation was also reflected in sports. In 1991, Albanian separatist complaining about the situation, formed the Football Federation of Kosovo with all its organs. Drita then joined the new league system in Kosovo, where they played in the fields of the mountains around the city of Gjilan.\n\nAfter the 90s, Drita was taken into management by Selami Osmani - Bezi with whom for 15 years reached the tops of Kosovan football, thanks to the players that brought in Gjilan, he who for 15 years contributed to Drita. Under his management Drita managed to adorn the title of the Kosovo championship in 2002–03, win the cup in 2000–01 and be a runner-up in 1999–2000 and 2001–02. Drita also reached the semifinals in 1999–00, 2001–02 and 2002–03, breaking a Kosovo record that for four consecutive years did not descend below the third position and for four years at least until the semifinals of the Kosovar Cup.\n\nOn 21 July 2016, Valon Murseli and Flamur Bunjaku took over the club, the two businessmans promised big things to the club, where in 2017–18 they relied on them, proclaiming champions for the second time in the clubs history.\n\nDrita in the 1997–98 championship was great wherever in Kosovo and in many sporting games, the meetings started but it was difficult to name the fans. The Ballkani and Drita match was a tough game because Ballkani fought for the survival and Drita for champion, so the fans traveled to Suva Reka for the last time without a name after this game, before the game against biggest rival Gjilani, the board succumbed and after many debates the name was assigned because most of the players except they played were also writers, poets, politicians and so on.\n\nThe Intellectuals are the biggest ultras group in Kosovo, with many transfers outside Gjilan. They also have the record of audience in football of Kosovo, the biggest was against Gjilani in 2011 with 13,000 fans and they traveled also in 2002 with 30,000 fans to the final of the Kosovar Cup in the Fadil Vokrri Stadium.\n\nAlso at there are groups of hooligans who do incidents especially during the derby towards Gjilani.\n\nBut there are also other incidents with other groups, The incident with of Prishtina was where during the last game of the championship there was attack on the fans of Prishtina, the worst incident was the violation of the fans of Prishtina by the hooligans from Gjilan where 13 fans were injured.\n\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league and this is particularly the case in the Football Superleague of Kosovo, where the game between Drita and Gjilani is known as the Kosovo Derby. According to the tradition of the city of Gjilan, the party starts with fans organization, who try to give the maximum support for the respective clubs, there is also some surprise for the other opponent camp, to say that we were better and is appreciated more than what is presented to you with great curiosity about the whole city, what a presentation will be on the weekend from and .\n\nThree days before the match the derby gives the atmosphere a night life, everywhere in the cafe bars is an atmosphere that occurs only during national holidays, where fans are seen by both the and to live all that week under the fever of the much-anticipated derby.\n\nOne hour before the match, the two camps are organized in groups and always avoid eventual incidents between the two ultras groups. They divide the streets from where they will go to the stadium, which is good, because the Kosovo Police organised themselves in a way to avoid the breakdown of this holiday and the much anticipated confrontation in Gjilan.\n\nFor a brief few moments, everything apart from the dozens of flares that littered the pitch, that'd had disappeared from view. Gone were the two white minarets that usually overlook the stadium in eastern Kosovo. Gone too were the lines of riot police patrolling the front of the main stand along with the 10,000 strong crowd, all enveloped in a monstrous blue cloud of smoke. On the other side of the pitch, a similar scene was being played out, but the consuming cloud was red. The only evidence of a football match being played was the thunderous noise of drums and chants rising ethereally from the fog.\n\nDrita in the 2017–18 season has not suffered any losses, so it has broken its record since 2002–03 season with 30 undefeated games.\nAfter the war, the financial condition of clubs did not allow them to look after their kits, it happened that within a season the club's shirts have changed. But since joining UEFA and FIFA, this problem has disappeared. During the presentation of Betim Haxhimusa, they also unveiled the new kits that would be worn in the 2018–19 season, while the traditional colors are interwoven in a design inspired by the famous sportswear brand Givova. While in the UEFA Champions League match against Malmö in Sweden, Drita played with their third kits making the presentation in public for the first time.\n\nThe club has played its home games at the Gjilan City Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium in Gjilan, Kosovo. The stadium has a capacity of 10,000 people all seater. Since 2017, the stadium is under renovation as it does not meet any level required by UEFA and the goal is to get the stadium to become a fourth-tier UEFA stadium.\n\nBelow is a list of Drita managers from 1999, until the present day.\n\nDrita competed in the UEFA Champions League for the first time in the 2018–19 season, entering at the preliminary round. On 12 June 2018, in Nyon, the draw was held and Drita were drawn against the Andorran side Santa Coloma. On 26 June 2018, Drita beat Santa Coloma at Victoria Stadium in Gibraltar and became the first Kosovar side to win a UEFA Champions League match.\n\nAfter being eliminated from Malmö, Drita continued to play in the second qualifying round of UEFA Europa League. On 17 July 2018, Drita learns the upcoming rival which was the champion of 2017–18 Luxembourg National Division, F91 Dudelange.\n\n"}

{"id": "2358462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2358462", "title": "Hearnes Center", "text": "Hearnes Center\n\nHearnes Center is a 13,611-seat multi-purpose arena in Columbia, Missouri. The arena opened in 1972. It is currently home to the Missouri Tigers' wrestling and volleyball teams as well as the school's gymnastics and indoor track & field teams. It was home to the University of Missouri Tigers basketball team before Mizzou Arena opened in 2004.\n\nGroundbreaking for the Hearnes Center occurred in 1969, and the arena was officially dedicated on August 4, 1972. The arena got its name from former Missouri governor and 1952 Mizzou graduate Warren Hearnes. The cost of the building project was $10.75 million. Prior to the opening of the Hearnes Center, the Missouri basketball team played its home games at Brewer Fieldhouse, which was built in 1929 and has since been remodeled into a modern recreation center. \n\nHearnes quickly became one of the toughest places to play during the 1980s, when players such as Steve Stipanovich, Jon Sundvold, Derrick Chievous and Doug Smith suited up for Norm Stewart. Several factors contributed to this reputation: the steep banking of the seating area, its flat roof and angling of its upper sections, and The Antlers, whose presence in Section A-16 made them the bane of many an opposition. Decibel meters were added to the corners of the arena in the early 1990s in addition to new scoreboards, and it was not uncommon to see them go well above 110 dB during conference games, and regularly cresting 125 dB against Kansas or during 2001's famed \"Fire Code Game\" against Iowa, where well over 14,500 people packed the building to see then-#2 Mizzou be stunned by Steve Alford's club.\n\nIn its later life, the building saw several changes: a new floor was installed in 1998, rear-projection video monitors replaced the matrix boards at the turn of the new millennium, and the student seating plan was also altered. Before Quin Snyder came to coach the Tigers, student seating was scattered throughout the arena and distributed via who picked up tickets first, and while the largest amount sat along one sideline (including the band, Student Athletic Board and the aforementioned Antlers), others sat as high as the D sections, which early in the arena's life doubled as lecture halls (to this day, their seats have fold-out writing desks). Attempting to create an atmosphere similar to his former employers, Duke, Snyder mandated that all students be moved to one end of the court, where bleachers would replace the old seats and primacy would be given to his new \"Zou Crew\" club, with all other seating areas becoming general admission. The move was criticized for changing the atmosphere at Missouri games to something less distinctive while enabling more seats to be sold at a higher cost, but was duplicated (with more restrictions on student seating) at Mizzou Arena.\n\nThe Hearnes Center also contains a field house that is home to the indoor track and field team, as well as one of the country's largest blood drives. Each fall, students donate blood as part of the school's Homecoming week festivities. In 2005, students and Columbia residents donated over 5,000 units of blood. \nDuring the school year, the parking lot adjacent to the main building serves as student parking for the many on-campus residents.\n"}

It was formed in 1883 and received a Royal charter in 1958. The KNCB is responsible for the national men's and women's teams, and also for the various domestic competitions, including the Topklasse (Division One) and Hoofdklasse (Division Two) leagues, and the Twenty20 Cup. The KNCB has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council since 1966. It is one of the oldest national governing bodies in the sport, older than those of many full ICC members. The KNCB is also a member of the European Cricket Council, which organises the European Cricket Championship.\n\nKoninklijke Nederlandse Cricket Bond is an administrative organization responsible for the promotion, development, and organization of the sport of cricket in the Netherlands. It controls the men's national team, and the women's national team teams. The women's national team currently have Test status and played their first Test match in 2007. A total of 57 cricket clubs take part in the domestic season, which include the Hoofdklasse, Topklasse and the region T20 cricket.\n\nCricket was first seen being played on Dutch soil in the 1780s by an English traveller in Scheveningen, and by the turn of the 20th century, Dutch teams were touring England regularly. Cricket was one of the most popular sports in the Netherlands in the 19th century, surpassed since by many other sports, most notably association football. Cricket even found enough of a following to survive the German occupation of the country between May 1940 and May 1945. The sport, famously dismissed as \"unmanly and un-German\" and \"insufficiently violent\" by Adolf Hitler himself, endured thanks in no small part to the dogged enthusiasm of local players, who shrugged off the requisitioning of grounds and restrictions on weekend travel – not to mention the presence of thousands of heavily armed Nazis and the bombing of the main sports dealers in Rotterdam – to organise as many as 300 matches a year.\n\nThe KNCB has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council since 1966. There are a few cricket grounds in the Netherlands which are officially sanctioned by the ICC to host ODIs such as Amsterdam, Amstelveen and Voorburg. It hosted some of the matches of the 1999 Cricket World Cup, though the Dutch did not participate in that tournament.\n\nThe Dutch participated in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, 2003 Cricket World Cup, 2007 Cricket World Cup, and 2011 Cricket World Cup. In their debut campaign, they lost all of their matches barring a respectful performance against England. They qualified for the 2003 edition after winning the 2001 ICC Trophy, with their only win of the World Cup tournament coming against fellow qualifier Namibia. It was around this time that stars and excellent cricketers like Ronald Lefebvre and Ryan ten Doeschate started emerging to make Dutch cricket much more strong.\n\nThe Dutch qualified for the 2007 World Cup with a fifth-place finish at the 2005 ICC Trophy. The Dutch had a poor tournament, losing all three of their games, with South African Herschelle Gibbs notably hitting Dan van Bunge for six sixes in an over. After failing to qualify for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, they qualified for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, where they shocked host England at Lord's.\n\nAfter years of stagnation, the women's game is also developing rapidly in the Netherlands. Recently, the women's team outshone the men's team and they were given Test cricket status by the ICC in 2007 unlike their male counterparts. They played their inaugural Test match against South Africa Women in 2007.\n\nThe Dutch team qualified for the 2011 Cricket World Cup by coming third in the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier. They did not make much of an impression, losing all of their matches, but giving England a fright in Nagpur, where Ryan ten Doeschate smashed 119 runs.\n\n2010 turned out to be a memorable year for Dutch cricket as they defeated to Test-playing nations in the form of Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Netherlands cricket team are currently participating in the Intercontinental Cup and Intercontinental Cup One-Day while the women's team won the 2011 Women's European Championship Twenty20. More recently, they participated in the 2011 ICC Women's World Cup Qualifier where they came third in Group A, thus gaining both ODI Status and World Cup participation.\n\nBefore 1958 it was known as the Nederlandse Cricket Bond or the Dutch Cricket Board. After receiving a Royal charter in 1958, a \"Royal\" was added before the board's name known simply as Koninklijke in Dutch. The following names have been for the board in their history:-\n\nAs well as maintaining Dutch international sides, the KNCB is also responsible for managing the regional domestic competitions. The following domestic competitions are organized in the Netherlands:-\nIn addition, a number of youth programs as well as ladies programs are organized in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Netherlands Women's Team was traditionally weak but in the last few years, they have made tremendous development, gaining Test status and out showing the men in recent times.\n\nAmul was the official sponsor of the Dutch cricket team during the 2011 Cricket World Cup. More recently, the KNCB had a ground-breaking sponsorship with leading Dutch bank ABN AMRO, with chief executive Richard Cox announcing that with this partnership, by the 2015 Cricket World Cup, they can contract professionally many players.

It was first held in 1986 by the International Federation of BodyBuilders (IFBB.). In 1987 the IFBB allowed the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) to sanction the Ms. International as an amateur event. In 1988 the contest was again sanctioned by the IFBB. From 1989 on, the contest was part of the Arnold Sports Festival.\n\nThe top all-time winners are Iris Kyle with seven titles and followed by Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia with five titles. The only amateur to win the overall title was Kathy Segal.\n\nIn 2013, it was announced that IFBB would drop the Ms. International from 2014 IFBB Pro Schedule.\n\nThe first Ms. International was held in 1986, and was sanctioned by the International Federation of BodyBuilders (I.F.B.B.). The contest was held in conjunction with the men’s event, which was called the IFBB Pro World Championship. Ben Weider proclaimed that the top six finishers would qualify for IFBB pro status, and be invited to compete at the 1986 IFBB Pro World in Toronto. The 1986 and 1988 Ms. Internationals were designated as pro-am contests, and top amateurs were also invited to compete. In 1987, the Ms. International was an amateur event sanctioned by the AAU. In 1988, Jim Lorimer and Arnold Schwarzenegger felt the women’s competition should become a regular event along with the men’s.\n\nSince 1989, the men’s Pro World Championship was renamed the Arnold Schwarzenegger Classic and the Ms. International become part of The Arnold Classic Weekend. That same year Tonya Knight had to forfeit both her placing and prize money from the 1988 and 1989 Ms. International when it was found out that she used someone else to take her drug test at the 1989 Ms. Olympia. The first most narrowest victory came in 1991 when Tonya Knight topped Anja Schreiner by a score of 30 to 32. There has been some controversy at the 1992 Ms. International. Anja Schreiner and Paula Bircumshaw both had the same body height, however Paula had much more muscle and weight (162 lbs). The judges regulated her to eighth place and the judges did not, as custom, called out out the top ten competitors on stage before announcing the winners. However this time, they only announced the top six competitors on stage in order to prevent Paula back on stage. The audience rioted over this decision and changed Paula's name. Paula did come back on stage only to give the judges the middle finger. Because of this she was given a year's suspension. In 1996, Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls became the first to win both Ms. International and Ms. Olympia in the same year.\n\nThe 2000 contest saw the introduction of weight classes, with a posedown between the two class winners to decide the overall championship. In 2004, Iris Kyle won her first heavyweight and overall Ms. Intentional. In 2005, Iris skipped the Ms. International, and focused defending her Olympia title, allowing Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia to win.\n\nThe contest reverted to the single, open-class format in 2006. In 2006 and 2007, Iris won both Ms. Internationals. In 2007, the NPC Arnold Amateur was created as part of the Arnold Classic Weekend, which contained amateur women's bodybuilding. The Arnold Amateur Ms. International, unlike Arnold Classic Ms. International, contains weight classes. From 2007 to 2010 the Arnold Amateur Ms. International contained three weight classes, lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight. The overall winner of the Amateur Ms. International win an IFBB pro card. In 2011, the middleweight was removed.\n\nThere was a bit of a controversy in the 2008 Ms. International. Iris was placed 7th due to \"bumps\" on her gluts which according to head IFBB judge, Sandy Ranalli, “distortions in her physique.”, The second most narrowest victory in Ms. International history came at the 2008 Ms. International, when Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia edged runner-up Dayana Cadeau, by the score of 30 to 32. Iris Kyle rebounded at the 2009 Ms. International, which she won. Iris went on to win both the 2010 and 2011 Ms. International. Due to a leg injury Iris could not compete in the 2012 Ms. International, which was won by Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia. In 2013, Iris Kyle won back her Ms. International title.\n\nOn June 7, 2013, event promoter of the Arnold Sports Festival, Jim Lorimer, announced that in 2014, the Arnold Classic 212 professional men’s bodybuilding division would replace the Ms. International women’s bodybuilding competition at the 2014 Arnold Sports Festival. Lorimer, in a statement, said “The Arnold Sports Festival was proud to support women’s bodybuilding through the Ms. International for the past quarter century, but in keeping with demands of our fans, the time has come to introduce the Arnold Classic 212 beginning in 2014. We are excited to create a professional competitive platform for some of the IFBB Pro League’s most popular competitors.”\n\nOn January 5, 2018, Beth Mandyck, a female bodybuilder, filed a sex discrimination lawsuit with the city of Columbus, Ohio over the IFBB cancelling the Ms. International from the Arnold Sports Festival. She has also started a change.org petition.
