Vietnam had reluctantly declined to host this edition because of the Vietnam War. Singapore, the youngest member of the SEAP Games Federation at the time, suggested in this edition of the games to change the name of the sports festival to the Southeast Asia Games. Although it was not officially stated, the inclusion of the Philippines and Indonesia in the expanded federation was to greatly help alleviate the hosting problems, as well as to set higher and more competitive standards in the games. After hosting the 5th edition, Burma declined hosting succeeding games due to lack of financial capability. This was Burma's second time to host the games and its first time since 1961.

It is a controversial move that has injured players and resulted in fines for players performing the tackle. The phrase was coined by Fox Sports NRL Producer Geoff Bullock (a.k.a. Bluey) in 2008.\nMelbourne Storm forward Adam Blair was found guilty of committing a chicken wing tackle in an Australian Rugby League match against Brisbane Broncos in April 2008. A former Storm player, Clint Newton of Hull Kingston Rovers in the Super League was fined £300 after performing the tackle, with a disciplinary panel finding him guilty of \"behaviour contrary to the true spirit of the game by making a dangerous tackle\".\n\nThe use of the chicken wing tackle in the Australian Football League is generally considered to have been picked up from National Rugby League.\nIt became a controversy after Kangaroos' skipper Brent Harvey was chicken winged in 2009 during an Australian football match and suffered a dislocated elbow that caused him to miss months of play. The tackle has been furiously slammed by some saying it must be banned. AFL umpires manager Jeff Gieschen is confident the practice is not about to become commonplace.\n\nIn July 2012, Carlton captain Chris Judd was involved in another \"chicken wing tackle\" controversy, in a game against North Melbourne. North player Leigh Adams had been tackled by another player, and was lying on the ground, as Judd grabbed his arm and pulled it backwards in the 'chicken wing' style. Judd was widely criticized in the media for this action and was cited for misconduct by the Match Review Panel. He was subsequently suspended for 4 games by the tribunal.\n"}

{"id": "22581945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22581945", "title": "Dick Telford", "text": "Dick Telford\n\nRichard David Telford AM (born 2 April 1945) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for Collingwood and Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1960s, although he mainly played reserves. He went on to become as a leading Australian sport scientist and distance running coach. He was the first sport scientist employed by the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS).\n\nHe was born 2 April 1945 in Melbourne, Victoria. Telford's primary school days were at College Rural, a small Melbourne Teacher's College practising school in the grounds of the University of Melbourne. His father (also named Dick) had returned from World War 2 and was studying for a B.Sc at the university, hence the connection with the university primary school. He attended Northcote High School.\nHe is married to Sue and they have two children.\n\nTelford never played a game of competitive football or cricket through primary school as the school was too small to field a team. This all changed when he went to Northcote High School where his football and cricket blossomed. He played his junior football with North Reservoir. He was invited to train with Fitzroy Cricket Club as a 16-year-old and at 17 he was invited to train with Collingwood Football Club. He won 3rd Best and Fairest for Collingwood Reserves team, playing on the wing, but due to the competitiveness of the team he made just one appearance in the seniors, a win over South Melbourne Football Club at Lake Oval, a debut he shared with Doug Searl. The following year, he transferred to Fitzroy Football Club and after playing well in the Reserves, he again won a place in the senior team, this time as a rover, but after two games was ruled out for the rest of the season with a badly damaged hand.\n\nA natural centreman, Telford was never given a chance to play this position in the VFL but transferred to Preston in 1968. Coach Allan Joyce immediately recognised his ability and selected him in the centre for the senior team after seeing him play one game in the reserves. Telford won that season's J.J. Liston Trophy, Best and Fairest Player Victorian Football Association, the club Best Player Award, and Preston won the Premiership. The following year, he won the club Best Player Award and the Preston the premiership. Telford retired in 1972 after 68 VFA games, by which time he had secured two club 'best and fairest' and participated in back to back premierships, in 1968 and 1969. Telford spent the 1975 and 1976 seasons as non playing coach of Preston after returning from Western Australia.\n\nThrough his football career, Telford played cricket, and appeared in 21 first XI district cricket matches between 1964/65 and 1968/69 for University and Fitzroy.\n\nTelford was a world class veterans runner. He competed in the Melbourne Marathon in 1978 and recorded a time 3 hours 12 minutes, and following 5 other marathons recorded a personal best time of 2 hour 27 minutes. In 1984, he turned to the track and he won his first Australian veterans M40 1500m championship in 1985. At the 1987 World Veterans Games in Melbourne he tied for third in the 1500m. He has the unusual personal achievement of recording personal his career personal best times in the 800 (1.58), 1500 (3.57), 5k, 10k, half marathon (1 hour 9 minutes) and marathon (2 hours 27 minutes)in his very last races in these events. Te\n\nOn leaving Northcote High School in 1962, Telford pursued his love of sport and physical education and completed a Diploma in Physical Education and Trained Secondary Teachers' Certificate at University of Melbourne to begin a teaching career at Glenroy Technical School in 1966. He soon found there was more to learn and following advice from good friend Ross Price, (North Melbourne footballer and University of Melbourne 1st grade cricketer) Telford went on to complete a BSc (Hons). Not wishing to leave Australia as did some of his colleagues, Telford pursued postgraduate work at his \"home away from home\" University of Melbourne (he went to Primary School there as well) and in 1976 completed a Master of Science at the University of Melbourne, with his thesis titled \"The maximal aerobic power and related studies in sedentary subjects and endurance athletes from Melbourne\". In 1979, his PhD thesis titled \"Cardiorespiratory properties of trained and untrained subjects and specificity of athletic performance evaluation\" was completed at the University of Melbourne. He then worked as a lecturer in the Physical Education Department at Preston Institute of Technology.\n\nAfter leaving the AIS in 2005, Telford returned to his research passion. He took up positions as Research Director of the Lifestyle of Our Kids (LOOK) Project, Commonwealth Institute, Adjunct Professor at the Australian National University College of Medicine, Biology and Environment and Research Fellow at the Canberra Hospital's Clinical Trials Unit. The four-year LOOK study of 734 otherwise healthy Australian children in the general community, aged between 8 and 12 years, has found that the main difference between lean and overweight children was that lean children were more physically active. The study provides important evidence in the childhood obesity debate.\n\nWhilst studying for his PhD, Telford was invited to look after the Victorian Sheffield Shield Cricket team as Manager and Coaching Coordinator. During his time with the team, it won back to back Sheffield Shield's in 1978/9 and 1979/80 as well as the One-day competition.\n\nIn 1980, Telford was the first sport scientist appointed to the newly established Australian Institute of Sport. He was appointed to the position of Co-ordinator of Sports Sciences and Physiologist. Telford was required to develop the philosophy, select major positions in sports medicine, physical therapy, psychology and biomechanics areas, develop sports science and medicine services and develop a plan for future facilities. John Bloomfield stated Telford was an excellent choice to establish sports science at the AIS as he was a talented exercise physiologist as well as competent distance running coach. Telford appointed Robert De Castella, as a sport science technician and he later went on to become a world class marathon runner. Telford was appointed team physiologist for the Australian swim team at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Telford expanded physiological services to include nutrition services and as the sport science medicine staffing expanded he was appointed Head of Applied Physiology and Nutrition. Telford played a major role in raising the profile of the AIS and sports science through the development and advertising promotion of two products. In 1986, Kellogg's launched the \"Sustain\" breakfast cereal, Telford played a major role and was prominent in television advertisements. In 1988, Telford and AIS nutritionist Vicki Deakin worked with Goodman Fielders to develop the \"Gold Medal\" bread. During his time in charge of AIS Physiology, the AIS undertook major research into nutrition, heat, altitude and talent identification. His philosophy was \" I always considered the coaches to be my boss. You were trying to help the coach get the best out on an athlete\". He left as Head of AIS Physiology to take up a distance running coaching role with AIS Track and Field. He was replaced by Allan Hahn.\n\nTelford became involved in distance running coaching in the 1980s. He was the physiologist to the World Champion marathoner Rob de Castella and coached Lisa Martin (Ondieki), to a silver medal in the women's marathon at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Martin is currently Australia's only Olympic marathon medallist. He became a full-time distance running coach in 1994 when appointed to run the AIS distance running program. He continued in this role until 2005 when the AIS and Athletics Australia decided to discontinue the program. Telford has continued to coach privately. Leading Australian distance runners coached by Telford include - Commonwealth Games gold medalists Andrew Lloyd and Kate Anderson, as well as Carolyn Schuwalow, Susan Hobson, Benita Willis, Sisay Bezabeh, Martin Dent, Nicky Carroll, Mizan Mehari and Lisa Corrigan. At the 2012 London Olympics two of his athletes Lisa Weightman and Michael Shelley were selected. Both athletes won medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. He coached Shelley to win the 2014 Commonwealth Games Men's Marathon gold medal.\n\nHe was distance running coach on the Australian teams at the 1992 Barcelona and 1996 Atlanta Olympics.\n\n\n\n"}

The most common version resembles an oversized hand with an extended index finger, and slits in their bases allow them to be worn over the hands. Usually the surface displays a silk-screened team name, logo, or other graphic or slogan, such as \"We Are #1.\" Foam hands are made of open-celled foam.\n\nThe first prototype foam finger was created in 1971 by Ottumwa High School student Steve Chmelar, who constructed a giant hand out of hardware cloth and papier-mâché for the 1971 Iowa High School Athletic Association Boy's State Basketball Finals, between the Ottumwa Bulldogs and the Davenport West Falcons. A senior in high school, Steve's photo was taken by the Associated Press and published in the Des Moines Tribune and the 1971 Ottumwa High School class yearbook, the \"Argus\", in Ottumwa, Iowa.\n\nIn 1976, Texas high school teacher Geral Fauss created foam fingers to show support for the team at the high school where he taught, to raise funds for the industrial arts club, and as a project that his industrial arts class could produce themselves. His first prototype foam finger was actually made out of plywood and had a painting of a \"number one\" done in the school's colors.\n\nFauss first sold his foam fingers at the 1978 Cotton Bowl in Dallas (University of Texas vs. Notre Dame), and he later went on to found Spirit Industries for the large scale manufacturing of foam fingers. In 1979, the first polyurethane foam version of the product was produced by Spirit Industries.\n\n\nBesides being sold at all manner of sporting events and venues as souvenirs, foam fingers are used as fund-raisers for schools and booster clubs as well as corporate promotions.\n\nTo date, the majority of \"foam hands\" have been produced in a planar-like form. However, in early 2009, a product that more-closely replicates the dimensional form of a human hand (like Hulk Hands with an extended finger) was introduced and marketed under the trade name Radhand until 2010 when it was renamed UltimateHand, produced by a new company called BrettHand.\n\n"}

{"id": "1521112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1521112", "title": "Ice racing", "text": "Ice racing\n\nIce racing is a form of racing that uses cars, motorcycles, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, or other motorized vehicles. Ice racing takes place on frozen lakes or rivers, or on groomed frozen lots. As cold weather is a requirement for natural ice, it is usually found at higher latitudes in Canada, the northern United States, and in northern Europe, although limited indoor events are held in warmer climates, typically on ice hockey rinks (motorcycles and ATVs only). Tracks in North America vary from 1/4 mile (~400 m) long ovals to several mile-long road course designs.\n\nIn Sweden and Finland ice racing have been big event since 1960 about.\n\nTracks used for ice racing include ovals and road courses. Some tracks are dirt track racing tracks with the snow plowed off them. When there is no natural snow, an icy surface may be created by spraying the dirt surface with water when the temperature is below freezing. Artificial ice tracks (usually speed skating ovals) are used where it is not possible to construct natural ice tracks. Some tracks are made by plowing the snow off an area of a frozen lake. Spectators frequently park their cars around the outside of the track on a frozen lake.\n\nIn the UK ice meetings have been staged at ice rinks. The longest running event, at Telford, features riders using conventional machines with spiked tires. In the late 1960s ice racing was staged at a number of rinks in Scotland but the machines used were rally based machines with all season tires.\n\nIn Nordic countries track are about one mile. Many tracks are very different\n\nIce racing tires are either studded or non-studded. Studded tires have a stud such as a screw or bolt to provide better traction and increased speed. Some studs are sharpened to increase penetration. Tires cannot be purchased with studs, so the pit crew needs to attach the studs to the tire. Through 2008, Menard's Racing in Wisconsin manufactured and sold studded racing tires for cars, and they were required in many ice-racing classes. Cars with studded tires are generally required to contain a roll cage and increased safety equipment since they achieve much more speed with the greater cornering abilities.\n\nThe sanctioning body's rule book generally specifies the length and/or type of stud, often with the goal of controlling the level of damage done to the ice surface. Aggressive studs can cause enough damage to be a safety concern as they wear through the ice on successive laps, particularly during door-to-door auto racing.\n\nNon-studded tires are standard production snow tires, as used on highway-use passenger cars in colder climates. Drivers often use winter tires. Favorites among ice-racers include the Bridgestone Blizzaks and Nokian Hakkapeliittas.\n\nNordic we have tree different tires one are same than Sweden rally tires then step bigger are 11mm long spikes and Swedish have class for 23mm spike+8mm nut so they are long ones\n\nIce racing includes a motorcycle class which is the equivalent of Speedway on ice. Bikes race anti-clockwise around oval tracks between and in length. The race structure and scoring is similar to Speedway.\n\nThe bikes bear a passing resemblance to those used for speedway, but have a longer wheelbase and a more rigid frame. The sport is divided into classes for full-rubber and studded tires. The studded tire category involves competitors riding on bikes with spikes up to in length screwed into each tread-less tyre, each bike has 90 spikes on the front tyre and 200–500 on the rear. The use of these spikes in this discipline necessitate the addition of special protective guards (similar to mudguards) over the wheels which extend almost to the ice surface. The spiked tyres produce a tremendous amount of traction and this means two-speed gearboxes are also required. As with speedway, the bikes do not have brakes. Czech made 4-stroke Jawa motorcycles have been the dominant force in this sport.\n\nIn the studded tyre class there is no broadsiding around the bends due to the grip produced by the spikes digging into the ice. Instead, riders lean their bikes into the bends at an angle where the handlebars just skim the track surface. Speeds approach on the straights, and on the bends. The safety barrier usually consists of straw bales or banked-up snow and ice around the outer edge of the track.\n\nThe riding style required for studded ice racing is different from that used in the other track racing disciplines. This means riders from this discipline rarely participate in Speedway or its other variants and vice versa.\n\nThe majority of Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme sanctioned team and individual meetings are held in Russia, Sweden and Finland, but events are also held in the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary (since 2000), the Netherlands, and occasionally other countries. Countries that dominated and won the majority of titles in Individual Ice Racing World Championship (held since 1966) and Team Ice Racing World Championship (held since 1979) were the USSR and since 1991—Russia. Canada's national touring series is sanctioned by the Canadian Motorcycle Association.\n\nAutomobile ice races have been most successful in France, where the Trophée Andros series, sponsored by an industrial jam manufacturer attracts ex-F1 drivers like Alain Prost or Olivier Panis, manufacturer-backed entries of sophisticated 4WD cars and international television coverage. The Trophée Andros races mainly use damped snow (that is not very different from ice regarding car handling) tracks in French ski resorts with a final race on artificial ice in Paris Stade de France. The 2006 trophy includes one round in Andorra. On several occasions a round also took place in Canada, in the Canadian Challenge, which is held yearly and is the most notable Ice Racing event in North America.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, there were two major Ice Racing Championships, the North American Ice Racing Championship and the European Ice Racing Championship. The North American was held in Anchorage, Alaska and their champions include Earl Bennett and Chuck Higgins, while Mexican Formula One driver Pedro Rodríguez won his class and an exhibition race in 1970, and was 2nd overall.\n\nElsewhere, ice racing has proven to be a largely recreational pastime. There is no professional ice-racing sanctioning body in North America, but there are clubs in several Canadian provinces (Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec, Saskatchewan) and American states (New York, Michigan, Maine, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Alaska). Some amateur and professional dirt track and paved track racers use ice racing to hone their skills or to practice for the summer season. Drivers often find that developing the car control skills needed on ice substantially improves their performance on a wet race track.\n\nThere is a new class in Canada called SS (street studs) where a car can run with the same modifications as a rubber to ice class, without the need for a roll bar. This same SS classing, although referred to as Super Stud or Studded class, by some American Clubs (such as the Anchorage Alaska Sports Car Lions Club) require any car running studded tires to meet at least IT rules and requires a roll cage and full safety gear. Some clubs even encourage people to ice-race their daily driver, and have strict no-contact rules to allow that safely.\n\nIn Russia there is a rally raid event, called the Northern Forest run on ice and snow in the last days of February in the outskirts of the city of St Petersburg. Also, in Russia exist popular winter track racing, where pilots race on short ice oval track, usually hippodroms, covered with ice during winter.\n\nConventional rallying also takes place on ice. Most notably, the tarmac of the Monte Carlo Rally is occasionally covered with snow and ice. The Sno Drift Rally in Michigan is another example of such events.\n\nThere are many classes of racing vehicles. The racing vehicles are frequently divided into studded or non-studded tire classes. Nearly all dirt track racing vehicles could be raced on ice. Flying snow and ice powder limits visibility, so some vehicles are required to have a bright light, normally red or yellow, on the back of the car for greater visibility in the powder.\n\nNon-studded cars are selected by their weight since non-studded cars cannot carry high speed through a corner and cars cannot get much power to the slippery surface. Lightweight front-wheel drive cars are generally the quickest.\n\nIce racing was featured in the 1969 James Bond film \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" with George Lazenby and Diana Rigg as they attempted to evade their pursuers. The track was in Switzerland.\n\nMotorcycle ice racing footage can be seen in the Bruce Brown documentary \"On Any Sunday\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1874032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874032", "title": "Kenan Memorial Stadium", "text": "Kenan Memorial Stadium\n\nKenan Memorial Stadium is located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and is the home field of the North Carolina Tar Heels. It is primarily used for football. The stadium opened in 1927 and holds 50,500 people. It is located near the center of campus at the University of North Carolina.\n\nThe previous home of the Tar Heels had been Emerson Field, which had opened in 1916 on the current site of Davis Library. By 1925, it was obvious that that 2,400-seat facility was not adequate for the increasing crowds. Expansion was quickly ruled out since the baseball team also used it, and any new football seats would have been too far away for baseball.\n\nFunding for the stadium was originally supposed to come from alumni donations. William R. Kenan, Jr., a dairy farmer from Lockport, New York who would later become a prominent businessman in Miami, got word of the initial plans and donated a large gift to build the stadium and an adjoining field house. Kenan was an 1894 UNC graduate and grandson of one of UNC's original trustees. Kenan persuaded UNC to build the stadium as a memorial to his parents, William R. Kenan and Mary Hargrave Kenan.\n\nGround was broken in November 1926. It was completed in August 1927. At the time, it was located on the far southern portion of campus, but expansions over the years have resulted in the stadium now being near the center of campus. The stadium officially opened on November 24, 1927. The Tar Heels defeated Davidson College 27-0, with the first touchdown in the new stadium by Edison Foard. The first game at Kenan Stadium brought in 9,000 spectators. It was officially dedicated to the Kenan family on Thanksgiving Day in 1927 in front of 28,000 fans, after the Tar Heels beat the Virginia Cavaliers 14-13.\n\nThe original stadium - the lower level of the current stadium's sideline seats - seated 24,000 people. However, temporary bleachers were added to the end zones to accommodate overflow crowds, allowing Kenan to accommodate over 40,000 people at times. This happened fairly often over the years, especially during the Choo Choo Justice era of the late 1940s.\n\nThe stadium was first expanded in 1963, when Kenan (who died in 1965) donated $1 million to double-deck the sideline seats and add permanent bleachers to the end zones, expanding capacity to 48,000. A seating adjustment in 1979 boosted capacity to 50,000. In 1988, the old press box and chancellor's box were replaced by 2,000 seats between the 40-yard lines, expanding capacity to 52,000.\n\nThe stadium's biggest renovation project to date took place from 1995 to 1998. Head coach Mack Brown wanted a better facility to showcase a resurgent football program, which had gone from consecutive 1-10 seasons in 1988 and 1989 to a run of success not approached since the 1940s. For instance, Kenan was one of the few Division I stadiums not to have permanent seating in at least one end zone; the only end zone seats at the time were the portable bleachers added in 1963. Also, the locker rooms were somewhat cramped by 1990s standards.\n\nSeveral generous gifts resulted in the addition of a new playing field and a brand-new facility for the football team, the Frank H. Kenan Football Center, named for the great-grandson of the stadium's original benefactor. The Kenan Center included a memorabilia section showcasing the football program's history. The most visible addition, however, was 8,000 new seats in the west end zone, which turned the stadium into a horseshoe. Also added was a \"preferred seating box\" atop the north stands. Due to state law, only 6,000 of the new end zone seats were available in 1997. Capacity dropped to 48,500 in 1996, but leaped to 57,800 in 1997. The other 2,200 seats were added in 1998, bringing the stadium to a capacity of 60,000, not eclipsed until the 2011 season. In 2003, a modern scoreboard with video capability was added in front of Kenan Field House. The next addition came before the 2007 season, when the old matrix boards on the sidelines were replaced with ribbon boards.\n\nThe 2011 renovation and expansion fully enclosed the stadium for the first time in its history. This facility houses the Loudermilk Center for Student Excellence as well as 3,000 additional premium club, suite seating and lounge areas in the east end zone, bringing total stadium capacity to 63,000. As part of this addition, high-definition video boards were installed on each end of the stadium. In 2016, new ribbon boards and updated concessions were added. In 2018, the change from bleachers to individual seating reduced capacity to 51,000.\n\nIn December 2006, the Chapel Hill Town Council approved changes to UNC's development plan that included at least 8,800 additional seats for Kenan Stadium.\n\nIn October 2007, athletic director Dick Baddour announced plans for extensive renovations to Kenan Stadium. Plans call for a new academic support center in place of Kenan Field House, plus anywhere from 5,000 to 15,000 additional seats. The new seats will be added in the east end zone, turning the stadium into a bowl. Plans would have to be approved by the chancellor and the board of trustees, and will almost certainly require a fundraising effort by the Rams Club. No specific timetable had been set, but Baddour had said that he hoped to begin construction within 18 months.\n\nThis \"masterplan\" would be divided into two phases; phase one covering the west end zone and two covering the east end zone. The first phase consisted of adding a fifth floor (for recruiting and media space) along with remodeling the existing offices and team spaces in the Kenan Football Center. Approved on July 23, 2008, by the Board of Trustees for $50 million, Phase I renovations were completed on August for the 2009 Football Season.\n\nA third and final phase of the project was also planned. This will include new club-level seats around the perimeter of the stadium, a new suite level above the club seats, a much larger press box, and a brick facade encircling the outside of the stadium. Construction of this phase has not been scheduled, however, due to budgetary constraints.\nOn May 27, 2010, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Board of Trustees approved the immediate commencement on construction of the \"Carolina Student-Athlete Center for Excellence\", a $70 million expansion that would replace Kenan Field House, which was built in 1927. The entire project was funded by private donations and the selling of club seats and individual suites. This facility would be a combination of an academic center, \"Carolina Leadership Academy\", Olympic sports' strength and conditioning center, and visitor lockers within a span of two floors.\n\nHowever, the most significantly visible portion of the renovation was the addition of 2,980 seats, turning the stadium into a bowl. The additional seats in the end zone, named the Blue Zone, would be \"1,836 seats in the Concourse Club just a few feet from the field, 824 seats in the Upper Club/Loge on the fourth floor and 320 seats in 20 suites on the fifth floor\". The individual suites, each of which has 16 seats, will sell for $50,000 per year. Each seat in the club levels range from $750 to $2,500 per season. Furthermore, the construction of a new concourse in front of the Carolina Student-Athlete Center for Excellence would allow fans to move around the entire perimeter of Kenan Stadium for the first time. The exterior of the new section is similar in appearance to the Bell Tower.\n\nWilliam R. Kenan, to whom the stadium was dedicated, \"was the commander of a white supremacist paramilitary force, which massacred scores of black residents in Wilmington, on a single day in 1898.\" In 2018 the University decided to remove the plaque on the stadium mentioning him, and to designate the stadium as named for his son William R. Kenan Jr.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on June 24, 2008 by Ubisoft and developed by Ubisoft Montreal. The purpose of the game is to motivate players to reach and maintain a healthy lifestyle and target weight. In addition the game was developed with nutritionists, and includes a free pedometer to help provide the user with better results.\n\nWhile playing the game users create a personal profile to track performance and map out objectives based on personal information. While users continue to eat and participate in a healthy lifestyle, they are encouraged to input daily eating and exercise habits in order to achieve virtual rewards. The free pedometer is intended to be used to help players keep track of their physical fitness and can be updated through their Nintendo DS. By receiving immediate feedback from their device, users are also encouraged to challenge themselves.\n\nSection 1: Personalize:\nWhile personalizing their profile (including information such as age, weight, height, etc.…) users are asked a series of questions in order for the game to get a better understanding of their goals. Upon the completion and submission of information and objectives, the game will calculate BMI (Body Mass Index), and create a program best suited for them.\n\nSection 2: Daily objectives:\nBased on personal needs, preferences, and goals, players can determine how they intend on achieving a healthier lifestyle. The game will then create daily sessions in order to provide users with strategies to overcome specific challenges with a positive attitude. And, at the end of each day, players are encouraged to input daily physical activity, and recorded information from the pedometer, in order to yield better results.\n\nSection 3: Challenges:\nThe game also includes daily and weekly challenges intended to keep players motivated and on top of their goals. With up to 500 challenges, all catered to specific objectives, the game aims to provide players with a fun way to stay on track of their healthy lifestyle.\n\nSection 4: Progress tracking:\nFinally, the game reminds users of their accomplishments. With the use of graphs and charts, My Weight Loss Coach keeps a record of players’ achievements and allows them to access information on all recorded data, including: view your steps, energy balance (the balance between a players food intake and physical activity), and weight and BMI.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews on Metacritic, scoring an average of 63%.\n\nIGN rated the game a 7, and said that: \"My Weight Loss Coach isn't some cure-all casual game, but it's a neat companion to a full-on workout, or a great way to learn a bit more about the much-needed lifestyle change that comes with working out and eating right.\"\n\nIT Reviews was a bit less enthusiastic, commenting that the game was \"more of an informational guide than a motivational tool and even in this light the results and dietary advice on offer mostly consist of ball-park estimations that will have little impact on fine-tuning a lifestyle. Shop around and you'll find it available cheaply, however, so DS owners who may have considered buying a pedometer could do far worse than pick up this application for its additional feedback and ability to record and store daily activity.\"\n\nEuroGamer said that: \"As an actual coach it really only works in general terms: there's no way to finely tailor the experience for your own capabilities in ways that an actual person could, and there's not much to commit you if the determination lapses.\"\n"}

The stadium opened on October 9, 2008, and seats 20,213 for soccer, but can be expanded to over 25,000 for concerts.\n\nThe stadium hosted the 2009 MLS All-Star Game, the second leg of the 2011 CONCACAF Champions League Finals, and the final of the 2013 Lamar Hunt US Open Cup. It was also a host stadium during the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and a host for final stages of the 2015 CONCACAF Men's Olympic Qualifying Championship.\n\nIn 2005 a soccer-specific stadium for the team was approved for Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City. However, funding for the stadium was still hard to come by. A vote in early 2006 struck down a funding proposal for the stadium. However, Tom Dolan, the mayor of Sandy, said that he would not give up on his fight to approve the proposal in Sandy. The funding plan was revised, but was struck down later in 2006 over disagreements in the appropriation of millions of hotel-tax dollars for a financially unproven sports franchise. The proposal for Sandy was declared \"dead\" by Real Salt Lake owner Dave Checketts at that point, putting the team's future in doubt. Checketts said that he wanted the team to remain in Utah, but would sell it if a proposal was not put forward by August 12, 2006.\n\nParties from several cities, including Rochester, New York and St. Louis, Missouri, expressed interest in purchasing the franchise and moving it. Other stadium sites in the area were also proposed, including the Utah State Fairgrounds in Salt Lake City, and the tiny town of Vineyard, just west of Provo. Finally, on the very day Checketts had set as a deadline to have a stadium plan in place or decide to sell the team, and after months of up and down discussions with local municipalities, county, and state officials and a change in the funding structure, a tacit agreement between Checketts, Sandy City, and Salt Lake County was put in place, and Real Salt Lake announced that they would move forward with the construction of Real Salt Lake Stadium, which would ultimately be named Rio Tinto Stadium. The groundbreaking, coinciding with the Xango Cup, Real's match against international power Real Madrid, took place that afternoon featuring elected leaders, team officials, as well as the entire rosters of both Real Salt Lake and Real Madrid. On August 15, the deal was officially approved by the Salt Lake County Council.\n\nThe stadium plan encountered difficulties however after the Debt Review Committee of Salt Lake County voted against the stadium proposal 4–0 on January 26, 2007, citing what they saw as Real Salt Lake's financial inviability as the reasoning behind the lack of support. County mayor Corroon concurred with the DRC and the stadium plan was effectively killed on January 29, 2007. In response Real Salt Lake's owner announced the team would be sold and likely move out of the Salt Lake area after the 2007 season.\n\nThe Sandy Stadium proposal was not completely dead, however: a new stadium proposal was made on February 2, that would divert 15 percent, roughly $2 million a year, of the county's hotel taxes to the stadium project beginning in July until 2017. Such a deal would have to have been made by February 9, or the deal would have been completely off. The bill was passed by the State Senate.\n\nAfter Governor Huntsman made a move that would allow the team to remain in Salt Lake County: the Utah House approved House bill 1SHB38, by a 48–24 margin, effectively approving $35 million towards the development of Real Salt Lake's new home. The governor was expected to sign the bill, and ultimately did so.\n\nSandy City, along with the state of Utah and representatives of the team, finally came to an agreement regarding the placement of the Real stadium. The deal was shot down about a week prior to the agreement by the Salt Lake County Mayor Peter Corroon saying it was too risky. However, Utah's governor, Jon Huntsman, Jr. said that soccer was here to stay. The $110 million stadium was built in Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City. Rossetti's California office was the architecture firm responsible for the design of the new stadium. The stadium's opening date was set for October 9, 2008, when Real Salt Lake hosted the New York Red Bulls.\n\nAfter considering sites in downtown Salt Lake City, Vineyard, and Provo, a soccer-specific stadium for Real Salt Lake was approved for the city of Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City, in late 2005; however, funding for the stadium was hard to come by. A vote in January 2006 struck down a funding proposal for the stadium, and the project was declared \"dead\" by owner Dave Checketts on January 29, putting the team's future in doubt. Parties from cities such as Rochester, New York, and St Louis, Missouri, expressed interest in purchasing the franchise and moving it, and Checketts announced that the team would likely be sold and moved out of the Salt Lake area by the end of the 2007 season.\n\nIn response to the rejection of the stadium plan, local construction company Anderson Geneva offered the club of land on which to build the stadium just east of Interstate 15 in Sandy for free, at an estimated loss on the price of the land at US $10 million. The move prompted the club to make a new proposal to the Utah State Senate on February 2, 2006, in which 15% of the hotel taxes collected in Salt Lake County between July 2007 and 2017, equaling about US $2 million a year, would be diverted to the project. The bill was passed by the Senate, allowing for the club to announce the commencement of building what was then known as \"RSL Stadium\".\n\nThe groundbreaking of the stadium took place on August 12, 2006, featuring elected leaders of the state of Utah, as well as team officials and the rosters of both Real Salt Lake and Spanish club Real Madrid, who were due to play each other in a Xango Cup match a few days after the fact.\n\nOn September 28, 2008, it was announced that the naming rights to the stadium were sold to international mining company Rio Tinto, owners of local mining operation Kennecott Utah Copper. A 15-year deal was set into place, worth between $1.5 million and $2 million per year.\n\nThe stadium opened on October 9, 2008, in a Major League Soccer match between Real Salt Lake and the New York Red Bulls.\n\nBecause the stadium was under construction throughout 2008 and did not open until late in the year, most of Real Salt Lake's 2008 season was spent in their original home at Rice-Eccles Stadium, on the grounds of the University of Utah in downtown Salt Lake City. The first match (and first event overall) held within the stadium was a Major League Soccer match between RSL and the New York Red Bulls on October 9, 2008, which ended in a 1-1 draw between the two in front of a then-sellout crowd of 20,008 people. A few weeks later, the stadium also played host to the first playoff game in RSL history against Chivas USA, in which the home side ended up winning 1-0 in front of another sellout crowd.\n\nOn July 29, 2009, the stadium played host to the 2009 Major League Soccer All-Star Game between a team of MLS All-Stars and Premier League side Everton. The game initially ended as a 1-1 tie, leading to a penalty shootout in which the English side emerged as champions. It was the first time that a foreign team had defeated the All-Stars since the creation of the game.\n\nThroughout 2010 and 2011, the stadium became one of the toughest venues to play at in Major League Soccer, with Real Salt Lake having an undefeated streak of 34 games at home. At the time, it was the longest undefeated streak achieved by any team in MLS history; the record has since been broken by the Houston Dynamo, who won their 35th home game on April 14, 2013.\n\nOn April 27, 2011, the stadium played host to the second leg of the 2011 CONCACAF Champions League Finals between RSL and Liga MX club CF Monterrey, for the chance to represent the continent at the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup. The Mexican side ended up winning the game 1-0, and thanks to a 2-2 draw back in Mexico during the first leg, Monterrey were declared the champions on aggregate score. The game remains the farthest point achieved by an American side in any FIFA-sponsored competition.\n\nThe stadium hosted the final of the 2013 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup between RSL and D.C. United on October 1, 2013, with the away side winning the cup 1-0 in front of over 17,000 spectators.\n\nSince the stadium opened its doors, it has become a very popular place for the United States men's national soccer team to play matches against regional opponents. The first match held by the team at the stadium took place on September 9, 2009 against El Salvador, in a fourth-round qualifier for the 2010 FIFA World Cup; the game ended in a 2-1 victory for the home side in front of 19,000 spectators. The team returned to the stadium on June 18, 2013, in a fourth-round qualifier game for the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Honduras; the home side once again won at the stadium, this time a 1-0 victory in front of 20,250 people.\n\nThe stadium was used as a host stadium during the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and hosted two back-to-back games for Group C on July 13, 2013. In the first game, the United States defeated Cuba by a score of 4-1, while in the second, Costa Rica pulled out a 1-0 win against Belize; both games took place in front of a crowd of 17,597 spectators.\n\nThe United States women's national soccer team has also played three matches against international opponents at the stadium. The first game was played on March 31, 2010, as a friendly match against Mexico; in the first winter game ever played by the US team, the home side ended up winning the match 1-0, thanks to a second half goal by Abby Wambach. The second game took place as another friendly match on June 30, 2012 against Canada; once again, the home side ended up winning the game, 2-1, in front of 16,800 spectators. The third game was a friendly match on September 13, 2014 against Mexico; the home side ended up winning 8-0.\n\nAdditionally, the stadium hosted the 4 knockout stage matches of the 2015 CONCACAF Men's Olympic Qualifying Championship. These included a 2-0 Honduras victory over the United States and a 2-0 Mexico victory over Canada in the semifinals, then a 2-0 United States victory over Canada in the third place game and a 2-0 Mexico victory over Honduras in the final.\n\nSince 2011, the stadium has played host to the \"XFINITY High School Football Challenge\", a series of games that pits local teams Alta and Jordan against opponents from across the country. In the 2013 edition, the Alta Hawks took on the Bergen Catholic Crusaders of New Jersey, while the Jordan Beetdiggers faced the Allentown Redbirds, also of New Jersey. This game was discontinued after the 2013 edition.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted the \"Zion's Bank Top of the Mountains Bowl\", a bowl game of the NJCAA, since 2008. This game was discontinued after the 2011 edition.\n\nRio Tinto Stadium has been used on several occasions for rugby matches. The first rugby match in the stadium took place between college sides BYU and Utah in March 2010, and was also used as the site of the 2011 USA Rugby Championship, in which UC-Berkeley defeated Brigham Young 21-14. The following year BYU faced Arkansas State University in the final, defeating them. In May 2014, the Varsity Cup Collegiate Rugby National Championship final match saw Brigham Young defeat UC-Berkeley 43-33 in front of 10,172 fans.\n\nUtah Warriors (rugby union) will play an exhibition game against Glendale Raptors at Rio Tinto Stadium on March 30, 2018, ahead of their inaugural Major League Rugby season.\n\nOn September 20, 2008, it was announced that the naming rights to the stadium would be awarded to international mining company Rio Tinto, the owners of the local Kennecott Utah Copper mining company and its Bingham Canyon Mine on the west side of the Salt Lake Valley. A 10-year naming deal was signed, valued at around $1.5 million to $2 million a year.\n\nOther major sponsors within the stadium include Maverik, America First Credit Union, Vivint, Budweiser, and Zions Bank.\n\nThe stadium is located near the interchange between US Highway 89 (State Street) and Utah State Route 209 (9000 South), and is easily accessible from Interstate 15; however, parking near the stadium is very limited. The stadium is also accessible by light rail via the Blue Line of UTA TRAX; the nearest station is Sandy Expo on 9400 South.\n\n"}

{"id": "342480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=342480", "title": "Stadium Australia", "text": "Stadium Australia\n\nStadium Australia, commercially known as ANZ Stadium and formerly as Telstra Stadium, is a multi-purpose stadium located in the Sydney Olympic Park, in Sydney, Australia. The stadium, which in Australia is sometimes referred to as Sydney Olympic Stadium, Homebush Stadium or simply the Olympic Stadium, was completed in March 1999 at a cost of A$690 million to host the 2000 Summer Olympics. The Stadium was leased by a private company the Stadium Australia Group until the Stadium was sold back to the NSW Government on 1 June 2016 after NSW Premier Michael Baird announced the Stadium was to be redeveloped as a world-class rectangular stadium. The Stadium is owned by Venues NSW on behalf of the NSW Government. The nine-member Venues NSW Board is chaired by Christine McLoughlin.\n\n<ins> </ins>\n\nThe stadium was originally built to hold 110,000 spectators, making it the largest Olympic Stadium ever built and the second largest stadium in Australia after the Melbourne Cricket Ground which held more than 120,000 before its re-design in the early 2000s. In 2003, reconfiguration work was completed to shorten the north and south wings, and install movable seating. These changes reduced the capacity to 83,500 for a rectangular field and 82,500 for an oval field. Awnings were also added over the north and south stands, allowing most of the seating to be under cover. The stadium was engineered along sustainable lines, e.g., utilising less steel in the roof structure than the Olympic stadiums of Athens and Beijing.\n\nThe stadium lacked a naming rights sponsor in its formative years, bearing the name Stadium Australia between its opening in 1999 and 2002. In 2002, telecommunications company Telstra acquired the naming rights, resulting in the stadium being known as \"Telstra Stadium\". On 12 December 2007 it was announced by the Stadium Australia Group (SAG) that the stadium's name was to be changed to \"ANZ Stadium\" after concluding a deal with ANZ Bank worth around A$31.5 million over 7 years. This change took effect on 1 January 2008. In 2014, ANZ renewed the deal through to the end of 2017.\n\nIn 1993, Stadium Australia was designed to host the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nThe first sporting event held at the stadium was on 6 March 1999 when a then-record rugby league football crowd of 104,583 watched the NRL first round double-header, featuring Newcastle v Manly and Parramatta v St George Illawarra Dragons. The attendance broke the old record of 102,569 set at the Odsal Stadium in Bradford, England for the Challenge Cup Final replay between Warrington and Halifax held on 5 May 1954.\n\nThe first musical act held at the newly built stadium was the Bee Gees, consisting of Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb, on March 27, 1999. The band had embarked on what would be their final world tour as a group before the death of Maurice, the tour ending in the newly built Olympic Stadium. The show was sold out with an attendance of 66,285.\n\nThe stadium was not officially opened until June 1999 when the Australian National Soccer team played the FIFA All Stars. Australia won the match 3–2 in front of a crowd of 88,101. Stadium Australia also played host to the national side's historic playoff win over Uruguay in November 2005, a victory which granted Australia FIFA World Cup qualification for only the second time in the country's history. The event attracted a virtual capacity crowd of 82,698.\n\nThe 1999 Bledisloe Cup rugby union match between the Australian Wallabies and the New Zealand All Blacks attracted a then-world record rugby union crowd of 107,042. In 2000 this was bettered when an almost capacity crowd of 109,874 (capacity at the time was 110,000) witnessed the \"Greatest ever Rugby Match\" when a Jonah Lomu try sealed an All Blacks win over the Wallabies 39–35. The All Blacks had led 24-nil after 11 minutes only to see Australia draw level at 24-all by halftime.\n\nAn exhibition soccer match between the Socceroos and Premier League team Manchester United was played on 18 July 1999. Manchester United defeated Australia 1-0 in front of 78,000 spectators.\n\nOn 9 June 1999, the stadium hosted its first ever State of Origin series game between New South Wales and Queensland. The match, Game 2 of the three game series, saw the record Origin attendance in Sydney when 88,336 saw the Blues christen their new home with a 12-8 win. The attendance broke the Origin attendance record of 87,161 set at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for Game 2 of the 1994 series.\n\nOn 7 August 1999, a National Football League (American Football) exhibition game called the American Bowl was played between the Denver Broncos and the San Diego Chargers, bringing home former Australian Football League player Darren Bennett, the Chargers' punter. The Broncos won the game 20–17 in front of 73,811 spectators. This was Australia's first, and currently only, American Bowl game.\n\nThe 1999 National Rugby League grand final, played on 26 September between the Melbourne Storm and the St George Illawarra Dragons, broke the rugby league world-record crowd previously set earlier in the season when 107,999 came to watch the Storm defeat the Dragons 20–18 to win their first NRL premiership. \nDuring the 2000 Olympics, the evening athletics sessions on day 11 attracted 112,524 spectators on the night that Australia's Cathy Freeman won the Olympic Gold Medal for the Women's 400 metres. As of 2014, this remains the world record attendance for any athletics event. Also during the Olympics, the soccer final attracted 104,098 to witness Cameroon defeat Spain for its first-ever Olympic gold medal. This was an Olympic Games football attendance record, breaking the record of 101,799 set at the Rose Bowl during the Gold Medal game of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\n\nThe opening ceremony for the 2000 Summer Olympics at the stadium completely sold out all 110,000 seats, while the highest attendance for any event in modern Olympic Games history was recorded with 114,714 at the stadium for the closing ceremony of the same Games. Musical acts for the closing ceremony were a \"who's who\" of Australian music including Kylie Minogue, John Williamson, John Paul Young, Jimmy Barnes, Midnight Oil, INXS (with Jon Stevens), Men at Work, and Slim Dusty who sang \"Waltzing Matilda\". Also in attendance on stage during the Closing ceremony were other famous Australian's including golfer Greg Norman and comedian-actor Paul Hogan.\n\nThe Sydney Swans v Collingwood Australian Football League (AFL) match at the Stadium on Saturday, 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an Australian rules football match outside of Victoria with 72,393 spectators (87.7% capacity) attending and was the largest home-and-away AFL crowd at any Australian stadium for 2003. The attendance broke the record of 66,897 set at Football Park in Adelaide, South Australia on 28 September 1976 for the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) grand final between the Sturt and Port Adelaide Football Clubs.\n2 October 2005 saw 82,453 attend the NRL grand final in which the Wests Tigers defeated the North Queensland Cowboys 30–16.\n\n16 November 2005 saw 82,698 attend the second leg of the Oceania-South America Qualification Playoff game for qualification to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Australia defeated Uruguay 1–0, which led to a penalty shootout as Uruguay had won the first leg of the playoff 1–0. Australia won the shootout 4–2 and secured a spot in the World Cup for the first time since 1974. The penalty spot where John Aloisi's spot kick secured victory has been permanently preserved and is on public display at the stadium.\n\nOn 1 October 2006, the stadium hosted the 2006 NRL Grand Final between the Brisbane Broncos and Melbourne Storm. It was the first time since the competition began in 1908 that two teams from outside of Sydney had contested the grand final. 79,609 fans saw the Broncos defeat the Storm 15-8. As of the 2016 NRL Grand Final, this is one of only two times that no Sydney based team has contested the premiership decider and also the only time an NRL grand final at the Olympic Stadium has failed to attract at least 80,000 fans.\n\nOn 5 October 2008, the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles defeated the Melbourne Storm 40-0 in the 2008 NRL Grand Final in front of 80,388 fans. This is the record winning margin for a grand final, breaking the previous record of 38-0 when Eastern Suburbs defeated St George in the 1975 Grand Final played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 2008 was the centenary year of the competition. It was also the first time a team had been held scoreless in a grand final since Manly had defeated Cronulla-Sutherland 16-0 in the 1978 Grand Final Replay at the SCG (the original Grand Final that year had been drawn 11-11).\n\nIn February 2009, the stadium replaced its existing two television screens with new Panasonic HD LED video screens that measure 23x10m – 70% larger than the original screens, and 50% larger than the screens in the Beijing National Stadium, whilst consuming less power than the old screens. Additionally, an LED perimeter screen showcasing ANZ advertising has been installed on the second level from the 30m line to the 30m line.\n\n25 September 2009 saw the largest ever NRL finals attendance (non-grand final) in competition history when 74,549 fans saw the Parramatta Eels defeat the Bulldogs RLFC 22-12 in the preliminary final of the 2009 NRL season. This beat the previous finals record of 57,973 set at the Sydney Cricket Ground for the preliminary final of the 1963 NSWRFL season which St George defeat Parramatta 12-7.\nIt hosted its first ever International Cricket match when Australia took on India in a Twenty20 night game on 1 February 2012. The match attracted a crowd of 59,569 which remains the largest crowd ever for a cricket match in New South Wales.\n\n30 September 2012 saw the largest ever NRL Grand Final crowd since reconfiguration up until 2014 when 82,976 attended the 2012 NRL Grand Final to see the Melbourne Storm defeat the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 14–4. This number was nearly reached in the 2009 NRL Grand Final between the Storm and the Parramatta Eels, with 82,538 in attendance. On 13 and 14 December 2010, a U2 concert, one of the biggest in history, was held at the ANZ Stadium.\n\nOn 6 July 2013 a new rectangle configuration record attendance of 83,702 watched the British and Irish Lions defeat The Wallabies 41-16 to win the Tom Richards Cup series by 2-1.\n\nThe record set by the Wallabies test was broken just 10 days later on 17 July when 83,813 (only 187 short of capacity) attended Game 3 of the 2013 State of Origin series. Queensland defeated NSW 12-10 to win their 8th straight Origin series. With 80,380 attending Game 1 at the stadium, the attendances also broke the Origin attendance records for the first and third game of a series. With the second game of the series attracting 51,690 to Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium, 2013 also broke the Origin series attendance record with 215,883 attending the three games.\n\nOn 6 September 2013, the largest ever NRL minor round attendance for a single game at the stadium was set when 59,708 saw eventual 2013 Premiers the Sydney Roosters defeat South Sydney 24-12 in the final round of the 2013 NRL season. This was also the largest single game minor round crowd in the history of the premiership dating back to 1908, breaking the previous record set at the ANZ Stadium in Brisbane (now known as the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre) on 27 August 1993 when St George defeated Brisbane 16-10 in Round 22 of the 1993 NSWRL season in front of 58,593 fans.\n\nOn 18 June 2014, 83,421 fans saw NSW defeat Qld 6-4 in Game 2 of the 2014 State of Origin series. After having won Game 1 at the Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, the home side's win saw Queensland's eight year domination of Origin come to an end as New South Wales won their first series since 2005.\n\nOn 5 October 2014, a new post-reconfiguration attendance record of 83,833 saw South Sydney defeat Canterbury-Bankstown 30-6 in the 2014 NRL Grand Final. It was the Rabbitohs first grand final appearance and premiership win since 1971.\n\nOn 27 December 2014, a new domestic cricket record crowd for NSW was set with 32,823 attending the Sydney Derby between the Sydney Thunder and the Sydney Sixers. The crowd was the highest domestic cricket crowd in NSW history, only to be knocked off a few weeks later at the Sydney Cricket Ground involving the same two teams.\n\nHistory was repeated on 4 October 2015 when for only the second time in the NRL's history, no NSW team was in the grand final and for the first time ever, it was a Queensland derby in the final between Brisbane and North Queensland. 82,758 people, many of whom had travelled down from various parts of Queensland, witnessed one of the all-time great grand finals when the game went into Golden Point time courtesy of a Kyle Feldt try in the dying moments to level the scores at 16 all. But the game would be remembered for Ben Hunt's dropped ball from the kick-off to extra time which led to Johnathan Thurston's field goal that gave North Queensland their first ever premiership in the NRL since being admitted into the competition in 1995. Apart from games involving national teams, the crowd is the largest ever in NSW not to involve a team based in the state.\n\nOn 30 September 2018, the Grand Final between the Sydney Roosters and the Melbourne Storm featured one of the most courageous performances in Australian sporting history when Cooper Cronk, despite carrying a severe shoulder injury from the week before, played for nearly the entire match, inspiring his Roosters to a famous 21-6 victory over his former club and at the same time denying the Storm back to back premierships.\n\nIn October 2001, major reconfiguration work on the stadium was commenced to allow for sports that require an oval field, such as cricket and Australian rules football, to be played at the ground. The two wing stands were removed as well as the athletics track and a movable seating section was introduced in its place. New roofs were built over the two ends and seats that had a poor view of the field were removed. The reconfiguration reduced the capacity to 84,000 for the rectangular field and 82,500 for the oval field at a total cost of $80 million. The construction work was carried out by Multiplex.\n\nThe reconfiguration work was completed in October 2003 in time for the 2003 Rugby World Cup where the then Telstra Stadium hosted the opening game, two other groups games, both semi-finals, the third-place play-off and final matches of the competition. In the first semi-final on 15 November 2003, Australia beat New Zealand 22–10 and then in the second semi-final the following day England beat France 24–7. In the final, on 22 November, England beat Australia 20–17 in extra time.\n\nIn September 2015, the New South Wales Government announced that within a decade the stadium would be upgraded, with a likely addition of a retractable roof.\n\nOn 23 November 2017, the New South Wales Government confirmed that Stadium Australia would be knocked down, with a new 75,000 seat rectangular stadium built in its place. On the same day it also announced that the Sydney Football Stadium would also be rebuilt before Stadium Australia. The original plan for Stadium Australia was for the demolition to start in 2019 and the new stadium to be completed by 2021.\n\nOn 29 March 2018 it was announced in a backflip by NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian that the demolition and redevelopment plans for Stadium Australia had been cancelled. The stadium will now be refurbished and reconfigured for use as a rectangular stadium, at a cost of $800 million, compared to the knock down rebuild cost of $1.3 billion.\n\nVarious sporting codes have used this ground on a regular basis. The National Rugby League is the most regular tenant of the ground, while rugby union internationals, soccer internationals and Australian rules football are all played at the ground. ANZ Stadium hosts the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCricket, both domestically and internationally will no longer be played at the venue, when redevelopment work begins in 2017 or 2018.\n\nOn 26 October 2002, Stadium Australia played host to Motorcycle speedway with the Speedway Grand Prix of Australia, the 10th and final round of the 2002 Speedway Grand Prix World Championship series. A temporary long track was used with American rider Greg Hancock winning the GP from England's Scott Nicholls and Australia's own future triple World Champion Jason Crump whose third place was enough to lift him to third in the championship standings above fellow Aussie Ryan Sullivan. Also representing Australia at the meeting were Leigh Adams who finished 4th in the World Championship, and meeting wildcard riders Jason Lyons and Mick Poole. The event attracted approximately 31,500 fans.\n\nStadium Australia played host to the first-ever Monster Jam Australia event in 2013, and remains the only venue to feature on all four Australian tours as of 2016.\n\nWhen it was Stadium Australia, the venue hosted the first American Bowl on 7 August 1999 between the Denver Broncos and the San Diego Chargers, which was the first professional American football game to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nANZ Stadium also held the opening game of the 2016 NCAA college football season on 27 August 2016 between the California Golden Bears and the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors, branded as the Sydney Cup.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13846238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13846238", "title": "Uppercut", "text": "Uppercut\n\nThe uppercut (formerly known as the undercut; sometimes also referred to as the \"upper\") is a punch used in boxing that travels along a vertical line at the opponent's chin or solar plexus. It is, along with the cross, one of the two main punches that count in the statistics as \"power punches\".\n\nUppercuts are useful when thrown at close range, because they are considered to cause more damage. Additionally, it is likely that a boxer would miss if the uppercut is thrown when the opponents are apart. Uppercuts usually do more damage when landed to the chin, but they can also cause damage when thrown to the body (particularly the solar plexus) or when landing on the nose or eyes.\n\nThe punch moves as its name implies: it usually initiates from the attacker's belly, making an upward motion that resembles a pirate's hook in shape, before landing on the opponent's face or body. In a conventional boxing combination, it is the second punch thrown, after the jab, but it can either initiate or finish a combination.\n\nWhen performing an uppercut, the attacker should stay close to the target, so as to prevent the opponent from detecting that the punch is coming, and countering with a straight punch. An uppercut from the outside also loses some of its power because the arm is no longer bent at the elbow and cannot effectively transfer the total body's force in the upward movement.\n\nSamuel Elias, also known as \"Dutch Sam\", is credited with creating this punch originally called an \"undercut\". It was reported that \"Dutch Sam created havoc with the new blow until a new way was found to block it\". Boxers famous for their uppercuts include Lennox Lewis, Joe Louis, Wilfredo Gómez, Julio César Chávez, Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Mike Tyson, Rubén Olivares, and Sandy Saddler.\n"}

A specialist batsman, he was mainly associated with Kent but also represented All-England. Although information about his career is limited by a lack of surviving data, he is known to have made 11 single wicket and 14 first-class appearances between 1743 and 1751.\n\nThe first definite mention of Val Romney is dated Monday, 11 July 1743, when he took part in a single wicket \"threes\" match at the Artillery Ground and the six players were stated to be \"the best in England\". They were William Hodsoll, John Cutbush and Romney playing as Three of Kent; and Richard Newland, William Sawyer and John Bryant playing as Three of All-England. Hodsoll and Newland were the captains. Kent won by 2 runs. The \"London Evening Post\" says the crowd was computed (\"sic\") to be 10,000. A return match was arranged at Sevenoaks Vine on Wednesday 27 July but \"it did not come off\".\n\nRomney was lauded as a \"mighty play'r\" (\"sic\") in \"Cricket, An Heroic Poem\" (1745) by James Love. This poem was written to commemorate a celebrated match between Kent and All-England at the Artillery Ground on 18 June 1744, in which Romney was captain of the Kent XI. In August and September of the same year, Romney played for London Cricket Club as a \"given man\" in three matches against Surrey.\n\nAt the end of the 1744 season, Romney played in two \"threes\" matches at the Artillery Ground. The first was billed as \"Long Robin's Side v Richard Newland's Side\", the teams being Robert Colchin (\"aka\" Long Robin), Romney and John Bryant against Richard Newland, Edward Aburrow senior (replacing John Mills) and Joe Harris. The stake was two hundred guineas and the players involved were stated to be the \"best in England\". In the second match on Monday, 1 October, the sides were Colchin, James Bryant and Joe Harris \"versus\" Romney, John Bryant and Thomas Waymark.\n\nIn the 1745 season, Romney again played in a major \"threes\" match at the Artillery Ground on Monday, 24 June, when he was teamed with Hodsoll and Newland against Colchin, John Bryant and one of the Harris brothers. Hodsoll, Newland and Romney won by 7 runs. The biggest first-class match of the year took place two days later between Long Robin's XI and Richard Newland's XI at the Artillery Ground. Long Robin's XI, including Romney, won \"by over 70 runs\".\n\nRomney is not mentioned in 1746 sources. In 1747 he played for Kent against All-England on Monday, 31 August, at the Artillery Ground; and on Wednesday, 2 September, on Bromley Common. On Saturday, 5 September, there was a \"threes\" game at the Artillery Ground billed as \"Long Robin's Side versus Stephen Dingate's Side\". The teams were Colchin, John Harris and Romney against Stephen Dingate, Richard Newland and Thomas Jure. It was played for sixty guineas per side and the players were specially chosen from those who had played in the two Kent v All-England games.\n\nIn 1748, Romney is recorded in two single wicket matches. On Monday, 8 August, he and Colchin opposed Tom Faulkner and Joe Harris at \"twos\" in the Artillery Ground for twenty guineas a side. On Monday, 29 August, he took part in a \"fives\" game at the Artillery Ground in which Tom Faulkner's Side defeated Long Robin's Side by four runs. The prize was 200 pounds. Romney was badly injured and could not run but, the rules being \"play or pay\", he was obliged to play as well as he could. The teams were Faulkner, Joe Harris, James Bryant, John Bryant and Durling versus Colchin, Romney, John Larkin, Jones and Maynard.\n\nIn 1749, Romney made first-class appearances for All-England against Surrey at Dartford Brent and for Long Robin's XI against Stephen Dingate's XI at the Artillery Ground. In July he played for All-England in a \"fives\" match\" against Addington. There is just one mention of Romney in 1750 when he played in the Kent side that defeated Surrey by 3 wickets in a first-class match at Dartford Brent.\n\n1751 is Romney's last known season although he may have continued for a few years more. Surviving data about matches in the 1750s is scarce. There was a general reduction in matches through the decade caused initially by the deaths of key patrons and then compounded by the impact of the Seven Years' War. Romney made two first-class appearances in May 1751 when he played for Kent against All-England. Kent, weakened by the recent death of Robert Colchin, were well beaten in both games.\n\nVal Romney's last recorded appearance was in a single wicket \"fives\" match for Kent against Surrey at the Artillery Ground on Monday, 3 June 1751. The Kent team was Tom Faulkner (given man), John & Thomas Bell, Stone and Romney. The Surrey team was Stephen Dingate, John Harris, Joe Harris, Stephen Harding and Perry. Kent won \"although the betting was in favour of Surrey\".\n\nIn Romney's career, the cricket bat was shaped like a modern hockey stick, this being the ideal shape for addressing a ball that was \"trundled\" along the ground, as in lawn bowls. The wicket consisted of two stumps and a single bail. Bowlers used the underarm style exclusively but at varying pace. The ball was either rolled along the ground or, if a fast bowler, skimmed across the surface; pitching was not introduced until about 1760, which would have been after Romney retired.\n\nF S Ashley-Cooper says of Romney that \"he was a most famous player, his name being found in nearly all the great matches of his time\" and that \"as a batsman and single wicket player he was very celebrated\".\n\nRomney lived mostly at Sevenoaks and was employed by the 1st Duke of Dorset as head gardener at Knole House, a post later occupied by John Minshull. By 1768, the Sackvilles still rewarded him with a Christmas gratuity of two guineas.\n\n\n"}
