{"id": "7747448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7747448", "title": "1750 English cricket season", "text": "1750 English cricket season\n\n1750 was the 54th English cricket season since the earliest known important match was played. Details have survived of six important eleven-a-side and four single wicket matches. Kent and Surrey played three inter-county matches.\n\nIn \"At the Sign of the Wicket\", F. S. Ashley-Cooper gives the opinion that the Hambledon Club was founded in or about 1750, but there is no evidence to support this view and the club's origin is unknown. As the team was playing top-class cricket in the 1756 season (i.e., its earliest recorded matches), it seems likely that a local club of some kind was founded much earlier than 1750 as it must have risen to a position of prominence in Hampshire before being able to take on the likes of Dartford from 1756. It is possible, as with many later county clubs, that a parish club was in existence for a long time and was then subject to substantial reorganisation after its team became famous. This might explain the many \"origins\" of the Hambledon Club up to about the 1767 season.\n\nThe following matches are classified as important:\n\n\"Thursday, 26 July\". Five of Richmond played Five of London for a guinea a man on the Artillery Ground. No details are known.\n\n\"Monday, 10 September\". The first of three \"fives\" between Stephen Dingate's Five and Tom Faulkner's Five at the Artillery Ground. Faulkner's team won this one, which was played for fifty guineas. Teams were: Stephen Dingate, James Bryant, John Bryant, John Bell and Thomas Bell versus Tom Faulkner, Joseph Harris, John Harris, Durling and Perry.\n\n\"Friday, 14 September\". The second match ended in a tie, both sides totalling nine. As single-wicket rules applied, all batsmen were out. It is known they were all bowled (but not who by) except for Dingate who was caught in the 2nd innings, Thomas Bell who was run out in the 2nd innings and Joe Harris who was caught in the 2nd innings (apparently while trying to hit the winning run).\n\n\"Monday, 17 September\". The third and deciding game of \"fives\" was won by Tom Faulkner’s side by an innings and one run. Dingate’s team scored 10 and 18 but Faulkner’s scored 29. The individual figures in the recorded score of Dingate’s second innings add up to 20 but 18 was definitely the correct total so one or more of the individual scores was wrong.\n\n\"Monday, 24 September\". Five of London v Five of Addington. Venue unknown.\n\n\"c.Monday, 27 April\". Death, at Deptford, of Robert Colchin (1713–1750), \"aka\" \"Long Robin\", apparently of smallpox.\n\n\"Wednesday, 8 August\". Death, at Godalming, of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond (1701–1750), who was arguably the greatest of the game’s early patrons, particularly of the Slindon Cricket Club and of Sussex cricket in general. His death was followed by an immediate slump in Sussex cricket and it is not until 1766 that a recovery can be discerned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "484704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=484704", "title": "Canberra Stadium", "text": "Canberra Stadium\n\nThe Canberra Stadium, known also as Bruce Stadium (For sponsorship reasons it is officially known as GIO Stadium Canberra, or simply GIO Stadium) is a facility primarily used for rugby league, soccer and rugby union games, located adjacent to the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra, the capital of Australia. The GIO Stadium Canberra is the largest sports venue by capacity in Canberra.\n\nDesigned by architect Philip Cox and constructed in 1977 for the Pacific Conference Games, it also was the venue for the 4th IAAF World Cup in Athletics. At the latter meet, the still-current world record for the women's 400m was recorded by East German Marita Koch, and a world record for the women's 4 × 100 m was set by East Germany and stood until the 2012 London Olympic Games.\n\nIn the late 1980s the running track was removed and re-located to the warm up stadium at the AIS site. In the 1990 NSWRL season, the reigning NSWRL premiers the Canberra Raiders moved to Bruce Stadium from Seiffert Oval in Queanbeyan, their home ground since entering the NSWRL in 1982. The Raiders won their second straight premiership in 1990.\n\nThe removal of the track meant that Australian rules football, more specifically the Australian Football League (AFL), could now be played at the ground. In 1995, an AFL match for premiership points was contested between the West Coast Eagles and Fitzroy. There were also a number of pre-season AFL games played at the venue, mostly featuring the Sydney Swans.\n\nAlso around this time, as an experiment, a cricket pitch was placed in the centre of the ground, and a day/night 1 day cricket match was played between 2 local teams before a small crowd. Regular cricket matches on the ground did not eventuate.\nFurther renovations occurred in 1997 in preparation for staging soccer matches as part of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, which also in turn shrank the size of the playing field preventing any future Australian rules football games being played on the field. The final cost of the renovations was more than seven times what was originally anticipated by the territory government of the time, and the subsequent controversy ended the career of then Chief Minister Kate Carnell. During the lead-up, on 28 May 2000, unseasonal snow fell during a match between the Raiders and the Wests Tigers, the only such event in National Rugby League history, with the snow causing frost damage to the turf intended for the Olympic football tournament.\n\nOlympic soccer in 2000 has initiated a stadium facelift converting the playing surface from oval to rectangular and bringing the crowd closer to the action. The only downside to this revamp is the stadium can no longer host AFL games. It is now an all-seater rectangular stadium with two main grandstands on either side of the playing field. As a result, all top-class cricket and Australian Rules football games in Canberra are now staged at the 15,000 capacity Manuka Oval.\n\nA 2008 Rugby League World Cup Group B game between Scotland and France was played at Canberra Stadium, the first ever rugby league test played at the venue. France defeated Scotland 36-16.\n\nIn 2009 there was an A-League bid from Canberra that, if successful would have seen a team play at the stadium starting with the 2010–11 season. However, the league chose to award second teams to Sydney Rovers FC (which dissolved due to financial issues) and Melbourne Heart FC.\n\nThe stadium is currently owned by the Australian Government through the Australian Sports Commission and leased to the Australian Capital Territory Government. While the current lease is due to expire in 2010, the ACT Government is seeking ownership of the stadium through a land transfer with the Australian Government.\n\nCapacity is a nominal all-seated 25,011, the largest crowd being 28,753 for the 2004 Super 12 Final. The main grandstand is named after Canberra Raiders and Australian rugby league player Mal Meninga, and a statue of another Raiders and Australian league representative Laurie Daley adorns the main grandstand entrance.\nThe eastern grandstand was named the Gregan/Larkham Grandstand on 28 April 2007, after Brumbies and Australia rugby union greats George Gregan and Stephen Larkham. Both ended their international careers after the 2007 Rugby World Cup as the two most-capped players in Wallabies history (at that time), with Gregan at a world-record 139 and Larkham at 102.\n\nWhilst the stadium suits the needs of its two current primary tenants, as of 2017 it is the smallest Super Rugby stadium and only a medium-sized NRL venue. The stadium itself is approaching 35 years old, and despite modernizations over the years is lacking in certain amenities for fans – especially covered seating.\n\nAdditionally, Australia had bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and Canberra Stadium does not meet the necessary criterion to host matches. As such, the ACT Government launched a study examining the upgrading or replacing of Canberra Stadium, with options ranging from increasing capacity and enclosing the current facility, to completely re-configuring the current stadium to an oval for cricket and Australian rules football and building a state of the art rectangular facility next door.\n\nCiting costs of building multiple facilities as an issue, ACT Sports Minister Andrew Barr indicated his preference would be a 'super stadium' built with World Cup standard facilities and capacity, able to be reduced to approximately 30,000 seats after the event. Such a facility would have to incorporate movable seating in order to accommodate all of the major Australian sporting codes.\n\nThe official bid for the 2022 World Cup indicated that the 'super stadium' plan was unlikely and the original plan of a new rectangular stadium built next door to the current stadium, with the existing facility re-configured for oval field sports, was considered to be the likely outcome.\n\nAfter the failed world cup bid a new rectangular covered stadium was proposed for Canberra. In 2013 the ACT government announced plans to build a 30,000 covered (with a roof similar to Forsyth Barr Stadium) rectangular stadium in the city on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin. It would be part of a 15-year significant redevelopment of the foreshore which extends the city to the Eastern Basin. Along with the stadium, as part of the redevelopment there would be apartments, a convention centre and an urban beach. Plans to build a new stadium have, however, been put on hold indefinitely due to the need for funds to compensate local residents over an asbestos home insulation debacle. Plans to construct the new stadium have since been pushed back by a decade.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2843859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2843859", "title": "Chess boxing", "text": "Chess boxing\n\nChess boxing, or chessboxing, is a hybrid that combines two traditional pastimes: chess, a cerebral board game, and boxing, a physical sport. The competitors fight in alternating rounds of chess and boxing. Chessboxing was invented by Dutch performance artist Iepe Rubingh. What was initially only thought to be an art performance quickly turned into a fully developed competitive sport. Chessboxing is particularly popular in Germany, the United Kingdom, India, and Russia.\n\nRubingh’s idea to create a new sport fusing the two disciplines, chess and boxing, originates from the 1992 comic \"Froid Équateur\"—written by French comic book artist Enki Bilal (born Enes Bilalović)—that portrays a chessboxing world championship. In the comic book version, however, the opponents fight an entire boxing match before they face each other in a game of chess. Finding this to be impractical, Rubingh developed the idea further until it turned into the competitive sport that chessboxing is today with alternating rounds of chess and boxing and a detailed set of rules and regulations. An earlier version of combining chess and boxing was said to have taken place in a boxing club outside London in the late 1970s. The Robinson brothers were in the habit of playing a round of chess against one another after a training session at their boxing club. However, no direct correlation can be made between the Robinson brothers’ chess playing and chessboxing. The same goes for the Kung-Fu movie \"Mystery of Chessboxing\" (1979) as well as the Wu-Tang Clan's song \"Da Mystery of Chessboxin'\" (1993).\n\nThe first chessboxing competition took place in Berlin in 2003. That same year, the first world championship fight was held in Amsterdam in cooperation with the Dutch Boxing Association as well as the Dutch Chess Federation and under the auspices of the World Chess Boxing Organisation (WCBO) that was founded in Berlin shortly before. Dutch middleweight fighters Iepe Rubingh and Jean Louis Veenstra faced each other in the ring. After his opponent exceeded the chess time limit, Rubingh won the fight in the 11th round going down in the history books as the first ever World Chess Boxing Champion. The same goes for the Chess Boxing Club Berlin, created in the following year (2004), that is the first of its kind making Berlin the birthplace of chessboxing.\n\nTwo years after the first world championship, the first European Chess Boxing Championship took place in Berlin on October 1, 2005. Present day chessboxing commentator Andreas Dilschneider was defeated by Tihomir Atanassov Dovramadjiev when he resigned in the 7th round (chess), crowning the latter by being the first European Chess Boxing Champion. In 2006, more than 800 spectators filled the Gloria Theatre in Cologne for the world championship qualification fight between Zoran Mijatovic and Frank Stoldt. The 36-year-old Frank Stoldt, who was a former UN-Peacekeeper in Kosovo and Afghanistan, won when his opponent resigned in chess in the 7th round. After qualifying himself to fight for the title in 2006, Frank Stoldt went up against the American David Depto in November 2007 in Berlin to fight for the first world championship title in the light heavyweight division. More than 800 tickets were sold for the event at the Tape Club in Berlin, making it the biggest chessboxing title fight to that date. Frank Stoldt defeated Depto in the 7th round, and thereby cemented Berlin’s status as the leading city in the chessboxing world becoming the first German world champion.\n\nChessboxing first received credit from the international Chess Federation FIDE, in April 2008; its president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, took part in a chessboxing demo fight in Elista. At the same time, the chessboxing community began to grow globally at an even faster rate. In 2008, chessboxing clubs were founded in London and Krasnoyarsk. Created in 2009, the Los Angeles Chessboxing Club was the first of its kind in the United States and was directly followed by the New York Chessboxing Club in 2010. The Boxwerk in Munich also opened in 2010 and offers chessboxing training. In addition to the WCBO’s initially European and then later world championships taking place worldwide, the scene at the London Chessboxing Club grew where chessboxing events take place on a regular basis. In 2011, the first international club matchup took place with Berlin and London in the ring—London came out the winner with 2:1 won bouts.\n\nIn 2011, the WCBO and with it the global chessboxing community made the biggest leap forward in its development to date with the foundation of the Chessboxing Organisation of India and its expansion in Asia, including also Chessboxing China and the Chessboxing Organisation of Iran which were founded in 2012. Furthermore, the third chessboxing organisation in the United States, USA Chessboxing, was founded in 2011 and the European movement was being reinforced by the foundation of the Italian Chessboxing Federation in 2012. What's more, the professionalisation of chessboxing started to take shape in the second decade of the 21st century. In addition to the WCBO that became a registered association under German law in 2014, the Chess Boxing Global Marketing CBGM GmbH—called Chess Boxing Global, CBG—was founded, that as of May 2013, is responsible for organising all of the professional chessboxing fights worldwide and above all, for the organisation of the Chess Boxing World Championships.\n\nThe Chess Boxing Organisation India was founded in 2011 by kickboxing official and former Indian kickboxing and karate champion Montu Das. With this, the growth of chessboxing in Asia gained momentum with the first Chess Boxing Organisation in Western Asia already being built in the following year by another experienced official in the kickboxing world: Fereydoun Pouya started the Chess Boxing Organisation Iran.\n\nAt the same time, the process of turning chessboxing professional reached a milestone: The 2013 World Championship in Moscow was the first chessboxing event organised and marketed by Chess Boxing Global. With three world championship fights in one night, more than 1200 spectators and a standard of fighting never seen before, the first CBG event set new standards in the history of chessboxing with Leonid Chernobaev leading the way. He has been able to make a name for himself with more than 15 years of chess playing experience and in the boxing world, as Marco Huck's and Yoan Pablo Hernández’ sparring partner and having fought over 200 amateur bouts. He won the light heavyweight title against Indian fighter Shailesh Tripathi after a technical knockout in the 8th round (boxing). Sven Rooch secured his title in the middleweight class division winning against Jonatan Rodriguez Vega after the Spaniard resigned in the 7th round (chess) and Russian Nikolay Sazhin won the heavyweight title against Gianluca Sirci by checkmate. Thus, Sazhin (Heavyweight), Chernobaev (Light heavyweight) and Rooch (Middleweight) would all go down in Chess Boxing history as the first Chess Boxing Global World Champions. They are also the first professional world champions in chessboxing ever.\n\nIn terms of its development into a mass sport, there was much success in 2013 and early 2014 for the chessboxing world. There were more competitors in the second and third Indian Championships in summer 2013 and early 2014 than in any chessboxing events ever before, with more than 245 fighters varying in both age and weight class, taking place in Salem and Jodhpur, respectively. Furthermore, the chessboxing community in London—under the command of London Chessboxing and the WCBA—has continued to grow constantly since 2011 and by now stages chessboxing events for 800 or more spectators on a regular basis 4–5 times a year at the Scala, King's Cross.\n\nLate 2014 also saw Finnish Chessboxing Club being founded in Helsinki by five founding members. Since 2013, actively developing Moscow Chess Boxing club MCBF\n\nChessboxing events in 2015 were produced by London Chessboxing under the WCBA—two events at Scala, Kings Cross in London. The second event in June 2015, The Grandmaster Bash!, saw the British, European and IBF light welterweight world champion Terry Marsh fight and defeat Dymer Agasaryan. Terry Marsh (57) is the first professional boxer to compete in Chessboxing and has competed in 3 fights since June 2014 in London and still remains unbeaten in his career. The fight was one of the most compelling to watch as it went the distance, normal time ending in draw. After a deciding round of boxing Terry Marsh was awarded victory on points.\n\nChessboxing has also become more popular among young, poor women in India where the sport has been seen as an alternative to traditional roles.\n\nA chessboxing fight consists of 11 rounds, 6 rounds of chess and 5 rounds of boxing, and a victory in either chess or boxing wins and ends the entire contest. Chess and boxing rounds alternate, a full-distance contest begins and ends with a round of chess. Each round lasts three minutes, regardless of whether it involves chess or boxing. A single chess game is played over the six chess rounds. These total 18 minutes; each player is subject to a time control of 9 minutes with no increment to make all their moves (blitz chess). After each chess round, the exact setup is digitally recorded and then repositioned before the following chess round. The breaks between the chess and boxing rounds usually last 60 seconds. The duration of the rounds and overall fight time in amateur chessboxing fights can change to some degree, as in for example youth tournaments and exhibition fights.\n\nA chessboxing match can end by any of the following:\n\nIn the case that neither of the chessboxers win in regulation time and the chess game ends in a draw, the fighter who is ahead on boxing points wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is also tied, the fighter that used the black chess pieces will be named the winner. This has not yet occurred in practice.\n\nLike boxing, chessboxers are divided into weight classes. Currently, the following apply to professional chessboxing events of Chess Boxing Global (as of October 2014):\n\n\n\nFor amateur and youth chessboxing bouts under the flag of the WCBO weight classes are graduated in 5-kilo-steps. In exception event hosts can classify into 10-kilo-steps.\n\nA chess boxer must have strong skills in both chess and boxing in order to be permitted to compete in a professional chess boxing fight. The current minimum requirements to fight in a Chess Boxing Global event include an Elo rating of 1600 and a record of at least 50 amateur bouts fought in boxing or another similar martial art. One deciding factor in chess boxing is that the fighters have to mainly train in speed chess; the skills required by speed chess are different from those for chess using classical time controls. However, chess boxing is not only the ability to master both sports but above all, being able to withstand the constant switch from a full contact sport to a thinking sport, round after round. After three minutes of boxing, pulses are racing, yet the opponents have to face each other at the chessboard barely having taken a break, and have to then perform calmly and think tactically. This switch becomes increasingly hard for the athletes as the fight goes on and they become tired.\n\nIn order to train these skills, a specialised chess boxing training is used, in which physical interval training forms are combined with blitz or speed chess games. Thereby the fighters adapt the rhythm of a chessboxing bout. For instance exercises like \"track chess\" and \"stair chess\" in which training partners will play an 18-minute game of speed chess over six rounds with intensive running exercises in between, such as 400-meter sprints or stair sprints. Other common methods of training combine speed chess games with strength exercises such as push-ups. The classic chess boxing training is box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.\n\nBetween 2003–2013, the chessboxing world championships were organised by the WCBO. As of 2013, they take the form of professional events under the auspices of Chess Boxing Global.\n\n\n\n\nThe World Chess Boxing Organisation e.V. (WCBO) is the leading umbrella organisation for international amateur chessboxing. It is based in Berlin, Germany and legally recognized as a non-profit organisation by the German Government. Iepe Rubingh founded the World Chess Boxing Organisation directly after the first chessboxing fight in 2003. Its goal was, and still is, to establish the WCBO as the worldwide organisation for the sport of chessboxing. The WCBO’s aim is to collect and link all of the active chessboxing clubs worldwide under one roof. It was legally recognised as a registered association by Berlin’s district court in 2014. The WCBO was the official organizer of the chessboxing world championships until it recognised Chess Boxing Global, in accordance with its statute, as the exclusive marketing agent for professional chessboxing fights, in 2013. Since then, the WCBO has been focusing on the organisation of the mass sport chessboxing and its further development. Chessboxing inventor and WCBO founder Iepe Rubingh, is also the current chairman. The first honorary member became Comic book artist Enki Bilal, whose comic provided the inspiration behind the invention of chessboxing.\n\n\nThe World Chessboxing Association (WCBA) is a legally recognized umbrella organisation for chessboxing. It was founded in 2013 and is based in London, England. English heavyweight chessboxing champion, Tim Woolgar, is its current president. The World Chessboxing Association originated from the London Chessboxing Club after having separated from the World Chess Boxing Organisation (WCBO). It was founded by Tim Woolgar in 2013 in order to accelerate the development of chessboxing. WBCO champions are also managed and recognised by the WCBA.\n\n\nLondon Chessboxing is a brand under which the sport of chessboxing has been promoted since 2008 in London, United Kingdom. Although the sport has been practiced in London since 1978, the home of Chessboxing in London today is Islington Boxing Club where London Chessboxing host regular training sessions.\n\nThe first ever Chessboxing event hosted in the UK under the brand was at Bethnal Green Working Men's club in Hackney by Tim Woolgar on the 15th of August 2008. Other notable venues include Chelsea Old Town Hall, The Grange Hotel in St Pauls and the Royal Albert Hall. Presently their events are hosted at Scala, King’s Cross, London and York Hall, London.\n\nChess Boxing Global (CBG) is a marketing agency responsible for professional chessboxing fights and all commercial activities affiliated with the sport of chessboxing. It is officially the only marketing agency for professional chessboxing recognised by the WCBO and takes on assignments such as organizing world championships for and marketing the profiles of professional athletes. Shortly after being founded by Iepe Rubingh in Berlin in 2013, CBG gained attention thanks to Enki Bilal auctioning off one of his paintings in Paris on February 23, 2013. The auctioned painting, that shows an artistic depiction of a chessboxer, was able to generate 174,000 Euro for CBG. The first world championship under the auspices of Chess Boxing Global took place in Moskow, Russia in 2013 before 1200 spectators. Professional athletes from all over the world fight each other under the slogan, “A quest for the smartest and toughest man on the planet.”\n\n\nA first feature-length documentary about chess-boxing entitled \"Chess-boxing: The King's Discipline\" follows the development of the sport over a span of 3 years. As the promoters in: Berlin, London and Los Angeles each attempt to bring their differing visions for the sport to a mainstream audience. The film includes various critiques of the sport, put forth by members of the chess and boxing communities; while seeking to understand the impact of a capability sport such as this - one combining two distinctly contrasted activities: boxing and chess.\n\nThe project is completely independent, produced and directed by Canadian filmmaker David Bitton and Darragh Brien under the banner of their Anonymous Pineapple Productions. A successful kickstarter campaign took place between June 12-July 17, 2013 and raised over US$35k for the production.\n\n\n"}

It is still largely in its original form and has a rich variety of trees and planting. It is close to St Albans City railway station.\n\nThe park was laid out in early 1894, and comprises a municipal sports ground and a public park and pleasure ground. The benefactor, Sir John Maple, the owner of Maple's furniture store in Tottenham Court Road and who lived at nearby Childwickbury, donated the land and paid for the laying out, the planting and the construction of the buildings; the layout of the park itself was designed by the City Surveyor, Mr G. Ford. A striking water fountain, which can still be seen today, was donated by Lady Maple.\n\nThe park was opened on 23 July 1894 by the Duke of Cambridge, a member of the Royal family, and the event was accompanied by great celebrations in the city of St Albans. \n\nThe sports ground hosts cricket, hockey, bowls and croquet and is also the home of St Albans City Football Club. \n\nThe public park includes large grass areas used for sun bathing and games during summer, a bandstand, a children's play-park and a café. The public park is also used as the site of some of the human \"Peopletown\" skits on Disney Channel's preschool series \"Bunnytown\".\n\nNext to the football ground is a cricket ground. The first recorded match played on the cricket ground came in 1875, when Hertfordshire played Somerset. The first Minor Counties Championship match played on the ground came in 1895 when Hertfordshire played Bedfordshire. From 1895 to 1997, the ground hosted 84 Minor Counties Championship matches and 2 MCCA Knockout Trophy matches.\n\nThe cricket ground has played host to 2 List-A matches, he first of which came in the 1984 NatWest Trophy between Hertfordshire and Somerset. The second and final List-A match played on the ground came in the 1990 NatWest Trophy between Hertfordshire and Warwickshire.\n\nThe ground also hosted a single match in the 1973 Women's Cricket World Cup, which was contested between New Zealand women and Trinidad and Tobago women. In local domestic cricket, the ground is the home of St Albans Cricket Club who play in the Saracens Hertfordshire Cricket League Division 2A.\n\n"}

The excitement to see Pelé playing was so big that the stadium's capacity was exceeded. Because of that during the game one of the fences supporting the crowd in the stands broke and many were injured. As soon as the incident happened, Pelé ran and jumped over the fence to help the injured people. Only minor injuries occurred and the match proceeded, ending in a 2–2 draw.\n\nEven though this is the \"home\" of Club Olimpia, the Defensores del Chaco stadium is used for important matches such as international matches for Copa Libertadores or derbies against the classic rivals such as Cerro Porteño. This is because the Defensores del Chaco has a greater capacity (48,000).\n\nThe stadium is nicknamed \"El Bosque de Para Uno\" on account of its surroundings constituting large, tall trees, thus the area is vaguely reminiscent of a forest (bosque). \"Para Uno\" references the location having been the first stop of a now defunct Paraguayan train.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19961701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19961701", "title": "Goal-line technology", "text": "Goal-line technology\n\nIn association football, goal-line technology (sometimes referred to as a Goal Decision System) is the use of electronic aid to determine if a goal has been scored or not. In detail, it is a method used to determine when the ball has completely crossed the goal line in between the goal-posts and underneath the crossbar with the assistance of electronic devices and at the same time assisting the referee in awarding a goal or not. The objective of goal-line technology (GLT) is not to replace the role of the officials, but rather to support them in their decision-making. The GLT must provide a clear indication as to whether the ball has fully crossed the line, and this information will serve to assist the referee in making his final decision.\n\nCompared to similar technology in other sports, goal-line technology is a relatively recent addition to association football; its integration having been opposed by the sport's authorities. In July 2012, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) officially approved the use of goal line technology, amending the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) its use. Due to its expense, goal-line technology is only used at the highest levels of the game. Goal-line technology is currently used in the top European domestic leagues, and at major international competitions such as the 2014 Men's, 2018 Men's and 2015 Women's FIFA World Cups.\n\nIn association football, a goal is scored if the whole of the ball crosses the goal line between the goalposts and under the crossbar. In most cases, this is relatively unambiguous (goal nets being a low-tech way of verifying that the ball passed the correct side of the goalposts). Occasionally however situations occur when it is difficult for referees and their assistants to tell if a goal has been scored before a rebound, save, or defender's clearance from the goal area.\n\nSince 2012, goal-line technology has been permitted in matches. Text relating to goal-line technology can now be found within four of the Laws of the Game:\n\n\nThe Laws themselves are not specific as to the nature of Goal Line technology systems, however other documentation from FIFA, which is cited by the Laws, goes into more detail. The \"FIFA Quality Programme for GLT Testing Manual\" precisely define the requirements of the systems. Four basic requirements of a system are stipulated:\n\n\nFIFA have a system whereby a particular technology provider needs to show effectiveness to successfully obtain a license for their technology, then an installation within a particular stadium must pass a \"final installation test\" before use, and before each game the referee must check that the system is functional.\n\nDue to the expense of goal-line technology systems, the technology is only currently used at the very top levels of the game. In domestic competition, goal-line technology is only regularly used in a few major European leagues:\nSerie A,\nLigue 1,\nthe Bundesliga,\nand the Premier League.\n\n, FIFA's website list 167 stadiums with licensed GLT installations, 166 of which use the Hawk-Eye system. One stadium uses GoalControl, which is the other licensed provider.\n\nPrior to 2012, competitions were unable to implement technology as provision was not made for it in the Laws. The Laws of association football are controlled by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), a body on which FIFA holds 50% of the voting power, sufficient to veto any changes to the laws.\n\nCompared to other sports, association football was late to allow technology to assist with in-game decisions. The matter was a subject of debate within the game for over a decade with the game's lawmakers resisting calls for its implementation.\n\nThroughout the 2000s various incidents incited discussion as to the potential for goal-line technology in the game. The lack of use of technology in association football was contrasted with other sports, which had incorporated video replays and other systems into their rules.\n\nIn response to this, FIFA decided to test a system by Adidas in which a football with an embedded microchip would send a signal to the referee if it crossed a sensor going through the goal. According to FIFA president Sepp Blatter, \"We did different tests at the Under-17 World Cup in Peru but the evidence wasn't clear so we will carry out trials in junior competitions in 2007\". However, those trials did not materialise and by 2008, Blatter had rejected the system outright, describing the technology as 'only 95% accurate'. FIFA and IFAB were resistant to introducing technology in the game, voting in March 2010 to permanently ditch the technology.\n\nFollowing several refereeing errors at the 2010 FIFA World Cup – including the disallowed goal in Germany's 4–1 victory over England, when Frank Lampard hit a shot from outside of the penalty box that bounced off the crossbar and over the line; the ball came back out and the goal was disallowed because the assistant referee did not call for a goal – Blatter announced that FIFA would reopen the goal-line technology discussion.\n\nBefore Euro 2012, UEFA president Michel Platini dismissed the need for goal-line technology, instead arguing for placing additional assistant referees behind the goal. However, in a Group D match with Ukraine losing 1–0 to England, the on-field officials did not see Ukraine's Marko Dević's shot briefly cross the line before it was cleared by England's John Terry, although an offside in the build-up to the incident was too unnoticed by the match officials.\n\nHeeding calls for the use of technology, in July 2011 FIFA began a process of sanctioned tests that eventually resulted in the approval of the systems used in the current game.\n\nThe first stage of testing considered multiple goal-line technology systems, with the requirement that the system notified the referee of the decision within one second of the incident happening. The message needed to be relayed via a visual signal and vibration. Tests were conducted by Empa between September and December 2011.<ref name=\"March 2012 IFAB/FIFA\"></ref> Tested systems included:\n\n\nOn 3 March 2012, IFAB announced that two of the eight proposed systems had proceeded to the second stage of testing. These were Hawk-Eye and GoalRef. In the second phase of testing, the manufacturer of the technology chose a stadium to test its technology in a number of imagined scenarios. Testing was also conducted in professional training sessions and in laboratories to account for different climatic conditions and other magnetic field distortions. There were also tests on the watches to be worn by referees. The systems underwent testing in some competitive matches.\n\nGoalRef technology underwent match testing in some Danish Superliga matches in the first half of 2012. Following the second phase trials, on 5 July 2012 IFAB approved GoalRef in principle, making it available for use in professional matches under a set of revised Laws of the Game. Each installation however would also require licensing approval for use in the individual stadium, on a 12-month basis. The 2012 FIFA Club World Cup was the first tournament where GoalRef was used by a match referee. Goal Ref was used for the first time on 6 December 2012 in the first match of the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nThe first match to use the Hawk-Eye goal-line technology was Eastleigh F.C. versus A.F.C. Totton in the Hampshire Senior Cup final at St Mary's Stadium, Southampton in England on 16 May 2012. Although it used Hawk-Eye, the system had no bearing on the referee's decisions and the system readings were only available to FIFA's independent testing agency. The system was also in place for the technology's second test on 2 June for England's friendly match against Belgium.<ref name=\"belgium/eng announcement\"></ref>\n\nFollowing the success of the trials, in July 2012 IFAB voted unanimously to officially amend the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) goal-line technology. \n\nIn December 2012, FIFA announced it would introduce goal-line technology at the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan. Hawk-Eye technology was employed at Toyota Stadium, while GoalRef was used at International Stadium Yokohama.\n\nGoalControl, a camera-based system which uses 14 high-speed cameras located around the pitch and directed at both goals, was used at 2013 Confederations Cup, partly as a trial for use at the next year's World Cup.\n\nThe Football Association announced that Hawk-Eye would be used in the 2013–14 Premier League season. On 16 December 2013, it was announced that Hawk-Eye would be used in three of the four quarter-finals and subsequent matches in the League Cup. The system was used when, on the very next day, in the Sunderland – Chelsea quarter-final, a goal from Frank Lampard was allowed. The first goal to be decisively awarded using goal-line technology in the English Premier League was Edin Džeko's goal for Manchester City against Cardiff City on 18 January 2014.\n\nFollowing success at the Confederations Cup, GoalControl was used at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The first goal given by the technology was in the 15 June 2014 group stage match between France and Honduras.\n\nGoal Line Technology was implemented across the major European competitions. In December 2014, the Bundesliga clubs approved goal-line technology that will be introduced at the start of the 2015–16 Bundesliga season. The league picked the cheaper Hawk-Eye system over two German technologies. GoalControl was introduced for Ligue 1 for the start of the 2015–16 Ligue 1 season. Ligue 1 later switched to using Hawk-Eye in 2018 after the GoalControl system made errors.\n\nGoal Line Technology was used in the UEFA Europa League final, UEFA Champions League, European Championship and Copa America for the first time in 2016. \n\nWhile advocates for goal-line technology maintain that it would significantly reduce refereeing errors during play, there are also criticisms of the technology. Much of the criticism came from within FIFA itself including former FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Apart from the criticisms revolving around the technical aspects of the two proposed technologies, critics point out that such technology would impact on the human element of the game and remove the enjoyment of debating mistakes. Sepp Blatter has been quoted as saying \"Other sports regularly change the laws of the game to react to the new technology. ... We don't do it and this makes the fascination and the popularity of football\".\n\nA study suggested that in the 2010–11 Premier League season \"errors took place nearly 30% of the time that video replays could help prevent\", but some people claim that instant replays would interrupt the flow of the game and take away possible plays.\n\nOther critics believe it would be prohibitively expensive to implement the technology at all levels of the game and particularly for smaller/poorer football associations. FIFA officials have expressed a preference for 'better refereeing' as well as more match officials over implementing the technology.\nAdvocates in turn cite the many examples of incorrect goal-line decisions deciding important games and point out that the technology has improved much since the initial trials carried out by FIFA. Advocates contend that any extra help for the referee should outweigh arguments that it would lead to non-uniform rules (since not all football associations would be able to implement it).\n\nBlatter had been opposed to goal-line technology until Frank Lampard's disallowed goal in the 2010 World Cup where the ball clearly crossed the line.\n\nThe introduction of additional assistant referees, who are mostly positioned beside the goal-line, was partly in order to facilitate in such situations.\n\nIn April 2013, MLS commissioner Don Garber confirmed that MLS would not adopt goal-line technology for the 2014 season, citing cost as the overriding factor. GoalControl installation would cost about $260,000 per stadium, and a further $3,900 for each game. \n\nIn early 2014, the vast majority of teams in the two divisions of the German Bundesliga voted against introducing goal-line technology for financial reasons. The costs per club would have ranged from €250,000 for a chip inside the ball up to €500,000 for Hawk-Eye or GoalControl. The manager of 1. FC Köln, Jörg Schmadtke, summarized the vote with \"The cost is so exorbitant, that using this (technology) is not acceptable\".\n\nWorld governing body FIFA are set to make £300,000 from the Premier League’s decision to install goal-line technology in all top-flight stadiums before the start of next season. Each of the 20 clubs will have to pay FIFA £15,000 to install, test and receive the ‘FIFA quality seal’ for Hawk-Eye’s camera-based system, which is expected to cost around £250,000 per ground in total. FIFA will also make an extra £15,000 from Wembley Stadium, which will have the technology installed for use in events such as the FA Cup semi-finals and final.\n\nThe Scottish Professional Football League stated in December 2017 that it would not be implementing goal-line technology, as it is only affordable for the richest leagues in Europe.\n\n\n"}

Named in honour of Percival Molson, it is owned by McGill University and has been the home of the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League from 1954 to 1967 and again from 1998 to present. The stadium is also home to the McGill Redmen of the RSEQ, the Montreal Royal of the American Ultimate Disc League, and the Canadian Corporate Soccer League, the largest amateur corporate league in Canada. The Selwyn House Gryphons high-school football team also play their home games at the stadium. The stadium has a capacity of 23,420 the result of a renovation project begun in 2009 that increased capacity from 20,202 to over 25,000, before seats were removed in 2014 to reduce capacity to its current level.\n\nConstruction was completed in 1914 on what was then known as McGill Graduates stadium, which was located on the slope of Mount Royal, at the corner of University and Pine (avenue Des Pins). The stadium sat dormant through World War I with the cessation of football from 1914 to 1918. On July 5, 1917, Captain Percival Molson (1880–1917), a McGill University alumnus and sports star who had been instrumental in getting the stadium plan approved, was killed in action in France (Molson was the great-grandson of brewer John Molson). His will left $75,000 to the university to help pay most of the total costs for the completion of the stadium. Other individual donors whose generosity built and renovated the stadium were William C. Macdonald and John W. McConnell. Designed by Percy Erskine Nobbs, the stadium was officially dedicated as McGill Graduates' Stadium at an intercollegiate track meet on October 22, 1915. It was renamed Percival Molson Memorial Stadium on October 25, 1919 by the university's Board of Governors, in honour of their fallen hero.\n\nThe Montreal Alouettes played at the stadium from 1954 to 1967 before moving to the Autostade. An attempted return to the Molson Stadium in 1972 was not successful and the team went back to the Autostade the following season. When a revived Alouettes franchise was forced to move a playoff game out of Olympic Stadium due to a U2 concert, they moved the game to Molson Stadium. The game was a sellout, prompting the Als to make Molson Stadium their primary home the following season. However, all playoff games are played at Olympic Stadium, which until 2007 hosted at least one home game as well. Percival Molson Stadium is also home of the Selwyn House Gryphons and the McGill Redmen football and rugby teams. The only Grey Cup game to have been played at Molson Stadium was in 1931. Nevertheless, it was the first time the Grey Cup had been contested outside of Ontario. It also served as a venue for field hockey, during the 1976 Summer Olympics. It seated 20,202 and had been sold out for Alouettes games from August 12, 1999 until the 2009 renovation.\n\nThe Alouettes' decision to return to the venue was problematic because the team was being sponsored by the Labatt Brewing Company and the stadium shared the name of its major competitor, Molson, though not named for it. Eventually, the team chose to change sponsors and have been sponsored by Budweiser since 2014. In 2004, The Alouettes installed a FieldTurf surface at Molson Stadium replacing the old-style Astroturf.\n\nMolson Stadium has been renovated and expanded, adding nearly 5,000 seats in time for the 2010 CFL season. The project to see the smallest CFL stadium increase to a seating capacity of 25,012 cost $29.4 million. Eleven rows were removed from the south side of the stadium to construct a second tier and add the majority of the new seats, about 3,800. Also, temporary bleachers in the east end-zone were replaced with 1,500 permanent seats, a new section was added to the northeast corner, and 19 new private suites were constructed. The cost of the renovations were shared by the Quebec government ($19.3 million), the city of Montreal ($4 million), and Robert Wetenhall, the Alouettes' owner ($6,023,935).\n\nBecause the playing surface is surrounded by a running track, the full 65-yard width of the end zones is not available at the two end lines. However, the full width is available for more than half of each end zone, with the only missing pieces being the relatively small bits off the corners. Since the 2014 CFL season, it is the only stadium in the CFL to cut the corners on the end zones after Edmonton's Commonwealth Stadium squared off theirs.\n\n\n\n"}

The use of foot skis is what actually defines \"skibobbing\".

Seven years later, the FISB (Fédération Internationále de Skibob) was formed, which since 1967 has held an annual Skibobbing World Championship. Although skibobs are often called ski bikes or snow bikes they are completely separate, and the sport should not be confused with snowbiking, which is the sport or recreation of cycling on snow.\n\nOriginally, skibobbing was one of the very few methods by which people without strength in their knees could alpine ski, but it soon became a popular sport amongst the physically able, too. The main attractions are said to be the speeds attained (in some skibob giant slalom races, speeds can be reached of up to 120 mph or more) and the feeling of jet skiing on snow.\n\nAustrian skibobber Erich Brenter is noted for setting the first world record for downhill skibobbing speed in 1964, at .\n"}

It is located in Sophia Gardens on the River Taff. It is home to Glamorgan County Cricket Club and is listed as an international Test cricket venue.\n\nThe venue is home to Glamorgan County Cricket Club which has played its home matches there since 24 May 1967, after moving away from Cardiff Arms Park. A 125-year lease of the ground was acquired in 1995, with the previous leaseholders, Cardiff Athletic Club, moving its cricket section (Cardiff Cricket Club) to the Diamond Ground in Whitchurch. Beside the cricket ground is the large sports hall complex of the Sport Wales National Centre. Cardiff Corinthians F.C. have previously used the area for football. In July 2007, Glamorgan cricketer Mike Powell was granted his wish to have a rib, removed during surgery, buried at the ground.\n\nSophia Gardens has been an international cricket venue since 20 May 1999, when it played host to the 1999 Cricket World Cup match between Australia and New Zealand. From 2001 to 2012, the ground was a regular venue for One Day Internationals, hosting nine matches in 12 years, but it was not until 2006 that it hosted its first England match, the first match of the series against Pakistan on 30 August 2006. In 2012, the ground was named as one of three venues for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, along with The Oval and Edgbaston; it hosted five matches, including the opener between India and South Africa on 6 June 2013, and the semi-final between India and Sri Lanka on 20 June. The ground also hosted two Twenty20 Internationals between England and Pakistan in September 2010, and it is due to host another against Australia in August 2015.\n\nOn 11 April 2008, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that the venue would host a series of major Test matches over the next four years. It would host its first Test match on 8 July 2009 as the opening match of an Ashes series between England and Australia. This made Sophia Gardens the 100th Test match venue. In July 2011, the ECB stripped the ground of its right to host the 2012 West Indies Test because of Glamorgan's late payment of the £2.5 million fee it owed for hosting the 2011 Sri Lanka Test. The ground was originally set to host a Test match against New Zealand in 2013, but this was given up in exchange for the 2013 Champions Trophy. The ground was chosen as the venue for the first Test of the 2015 Ashes series.\n\nThe £9.4 million cost to redevelop stadium was funded by with approximately half (£4.5 million) being provided in the form of a Cardiff Council loan. It is possible that the revamped stadium could host seven Test matches, nine One Day Internationals and two World Cup games up to 2028, injecting at least £50 million into the local economy. Construction of the redevelopment of Sophia Gardens began in April 2007, and the redeveloped stadium was first opened for competitive matches on 9 May 2008, when the Glamorgan Dragons played the Gloucestershire Gladiators in a Friends Provident Trophy match in which the Gladiators won by six wickets.\n\nOn 4 March 2008, Glamorgan Cricket Club announced a 10-year sponsorship deal with SWALEC, thought to be the biggest single sponsorship by a county cricket club, giving SWALEC the naming rights to the new stadium, worth in excess of £1.5 million over 10 years. \n\nIn June 2015, ahead of the First Test of the 2015 Ashes series, the stadium was renamed as simply \"The SSE SWALEC\" in reflection of the ownership of sponsors SWALEC by SSE plc. The new logo from June 2015 was designed to reflect the shape of the stadium. In April 2018 the stadium officially reverted to its traditional name of Sophia Gardens following the end of the sponsorship deal.\n\n\n"}

It is notable for its Victorian architecture with bright interior and its old-fashioned poolside changing facilities. The baths enjoy category \"B\" listed building conservation status.\nIn 1886, some Edinburgh residents and members of the Bellahouston Private Baths Club, Glasgow, decided to build a swimming club in Edinburgh. Frank Y. Henderson therefore formed the Warrender Private Baths Club Limited which bought some land from Sir George Warrender, 6th Baronet, and, using the local architect Robert Paterson, had the baths built. The original cost was £11,000 and the baths were opened on Saturday 17 December 1887 by Sir George.\n\nWarrender Baths differed from many similar facilities in Edinburgh in that they were originally built privately with the emphasis on fitness and leisure. Many of the city's comparable swimming pools were part of a much wider scheme to build public baths to promote cleanliness and hygiene amongst the working classes, who did not have routine access at the time to sanitation. Warrender Baths also sported a billiard room and a reading room.\n\nInitially the facilities were a success, but by 1906 were no longer viable and were closed. They were bought by the city for £3000, where they joined the city's portfolio of similar pools. Periodically suffering further closure threats, they were refurbished in 2005 and are now secure.\n\nThe baths are home to the Warrender Baths Club which is said to be the oldest, most famous and most successful swimming club in Scotland. David Wilkie the Olympic gold medallist swimmer, Ellen King and Keri-Anne Payne both silver Olympic medallists, bronze medal Olympic swimmers Paul Easter, Gordon Downie and Alan McClatchey, bronze Paralympic medal winners George Simpson and Sean Fraser and Olympic finalist Jean McDowell swam and trained with Warrender Baths Club.\n\nIn November 2009, a swimming customer at Warrender Swim Centre was hit with glass due to a glazing fault, resulting in an injury to his arm and requiring the closure of the centre as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of customers. The baths were opened again in June 2010.\n\n\n"}
