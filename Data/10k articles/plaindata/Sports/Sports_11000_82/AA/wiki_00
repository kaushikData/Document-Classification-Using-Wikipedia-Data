{"id": "57465828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57465828", "title": "Alerding v. Ohio High School Athletic Association", "text": "Alerding v. Ohio High School Athletic Association\n\nAlerding v. Ohio High School Athletic Association was a court case heard before the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which held that the right to participate in interscholastic sports is not a fundamental privilege protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution. In particular, the court held that the Ohio High School Athletic Association could prohibit private high school athletic programs from recruiting students who live in neighboring states.\n\nVirtually every secondary school in Ohio, whether public or private, is a member of the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), which regulates interscholastic sports within the state. By the 1970s, private member schools often dominated state championships, even though they made up only about a quarter of OHSAA's 800 members. Public member schools complained that private schools in border cities were recruiting out-of-state students for varsity sports, giving them a competitive edge over public schools. The association's rule against recruiting or \"school hopping\" was difficult to enforce against private schools that could enroll students regardless of residence. There was a rule requiring transfer students to wait one year before joining a team, but that usually left three years of play.\n\nOn December 18, 1978, OHSAA's 661 member schools defeated a proposal that would have split schools into separate divisions for the 564 public schools and 97 parochial and private schools. Instead, they voted 65.1% in favor of adopting bylaw 4, section 6.4–6.10 (originally known as rule 92G), which states in part: \"A student whose parents live in another state will be ineligible for athletics in an Ohio member school.\" The rule took effect for incoming ninth graders in July 1979. It primarily affected schools in Cincinnati and Toledo, where out-of-state athletes had traditionally competed. In the Cincinnati area, the new rule affected St. Xavier High School, Moeller High School, Summit Country Day School, Cincinnati Country Day School, and Seven Hills School.\n\nUnlike the Archdiocese of Cincinnati's interparochial high schools, St. Xavier was a Jesuit school not subject to parochial boundaries; it drew students from nearby communities in Southeastern Indiana and Northern Kentucky in addition to Southwestern Ohio. In the 1950s, up to a third of St. Xavier students were Kentuckians. Some of St. Xavier's most best-known alumni were star athletes while living in Kentucky, including Jim Bunning, Bob Arnzen, and Charlie Wolf. By the 1980s, St. Xavier competed in several sports at the Division I level and had won numerous district football and tennis titles and several state swimming championships.\n\nIn 1980, the parents of eight Northern Kentucky students who had been admitted to St. Xavier, including Tom Menke and Danny Mueller, sued OHSAA in Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas because the students would be banned from competition under bylaw 4-6-10. The common pleas court let the rule stand, and a state appellate court upheld the decision in September 1981.\n\nDennis C. Alerding resided in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and attended St. Xavier as a sophomore. Three Moellering brothers lived in Lakeside Park, Kentucky, and also attended St. Xavier: David R., a junior, Douglas R., a sophomore, and Gregory R., a freshman. All were ineligible to participate in the school's athletic programs due to bylaw 4-6-10. Alerding practiced with the wrestling team but could not participate in meets, while David Moellering had wanted to play baseball or basketball. In October 1983, their fathers, F. Dennis Alerding and Roger H. Moellering, filed suit against OHSAA and St. Xavier in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging that the bylaw violated the four students' constitutional right to a complete education. They sought a temporary injunction before the end of the winter athletic season and a declaratory judgment against the ban. The plaintiffs noted that \"Menke\" did not concern the constitutionality of the bylaw and cited a passage in the OHSAA constitution, which read in part: \"Competitive sports are an inherent part of the total education program for students in secondary schools.\"\n\nThe case came before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. On November 23, 1983, Judge S. Arthur Spiegel denied the temporary restraining order because Alerding and Moellering would have known about the ban prior to enrolling their sons at St. Xavier, and because the order would have forced part of the 1983–84 season to be played under temporary rules. On June 5, 1984, Judge Spiegel heard the case for three hours, then asked attorneys for the plaintiffs to return with information on how Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania treat out-of-state student-athletes.\n\nOn August 20, 1984, the district court found that the OHSAA bylaw could be considered a state action. However, citing \"San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez\" and the recent \"Camden\" case, the court ruled that interscholastic high school athletics was not protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause, reasoning that school athletics pales in comparison to the employment opportunities that the clause often concerns. Given that the courts had ruled educational opportunity not to be a fundamental privilege, extracurricular activities could not be considered fundamental either. The court acknowledged that educational opportunities may be a prerequisite for employment opportunities, but considered the impact of the bylaw to be a matter of degree. Based on these findings, the court denied the plaintiffs' requests for an injunction and declaratory judgment.\n\nIn response, State Representative Dave Karmol of Toledo introduced a bill that would have prohibited OHSAA from considering a student's state of residence in determining eligibility. Karmol said that Toledo-area schools, both public and private, supported the measure, but the bill did not advance.\n\nAlerding and Moellering appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, arguing that \"Rodriguez\" pertained to the Equal Protection Clause rather than the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and that the court should consider instead whether the bylaw was related to OHSAA's objective of eliminating unfair recruiting. On December 17, 1985, the appellate court disagreed with both aspects of the appeal and affirmed the district court's ruling, allowing OHSAA's bylaw to stand. By then, St. Xavier had 1,250 students, and the number of students from Kentucky had fallen to 35. St. Xavier principal Michael Trainor predicted that the ruling would further weaken St. Xavier's Kentucky enrollment despite strong historical family loyalties to the school there.\n\nAround the same time as the \"Alerding\" case, John W. and Judy Zeiler of Bedford Township, Monroe County, Michigan, sued OHSAA before the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on behalf of their three children who attended Central Catholic High School in Toledo, along with 32 other Michigan children. John William Potter of the district court granted a temporary restraining order, but the court ultimately allowed bylaw 4-6-10 to stand; this ruling was upheld without comment by the United States Supreme Court in 1985.\n\n\"Alerding\" has been cited in later cases to show that the actions of state high school athletic associations, such as OHSAA, are considered to be state action.\n\nOHSAA bylaw 4-6-10 barring out-of-state students remains in effect. A 2015 article in the \"Journal of Law and Education\" suggests that restrictions such as OHSAA's bylaw, as affirmed by the Sixth Circuit, should be revisited in light of the increasing importance of school athletics in future career prospects.\n\nDespite the prohibition on out-of-state students, OHSAA's public member schools continued to complain that private schools and public open enrollment schools enjoyed an unfair advantage over public schools by drawing students from a broader geographic area than conventional school district boundaries. In May 2014, a majority of member school principals rejected a plan to hold separate district, regional, and state championships for public schools and private schools, similar to the proposal that failed in 1978. Instead, they voted to institute a \"competitive balance\" plan that took effect for six major sports during the 2017–18 school year.\n\n"}
{"id": "4294908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4294908", "title": "Army Navy Match", "text": "Army Navy Match\n\nThe Army Navy Match is the annual rugby union match played between the senior XV teams of the Royal Navy and British Army. It marks the culmination of the annual Inter-Services Competition. Although a match was played between the officers of the British Army and the officers of the Royal Navy at The Oval, London on 13 February 1878, it was not until 1907 that the Army Navy Match became an annual fixture. For the first fixture the match Secretary was Surg Lt George Levick RN. From 1909 it was jointly administered by the newly formed Royal Navy Rugby Union (RNRU – 1907) and the Army Rugby Union (ARU – 1906). Since then it has been played every season, with the exception of during the world wars (1914–19 and 1940–45) when the matches were suspended.\n\nTraditionally the Army Navy match has been played in the second half of the domestic season but in season 1907/1908 it was played in December and due to this anomaly the calendar year 1908 did not see an Army Navy match played yet they played each other twice in 1907.\n\nThe 2016 Army Navy was the 99th in the series and the match saw another new record crowd of 81323 watch the Army Navy match which was one of the most compelling ever. The Navy took the lead 7–0 (Dave Fairbrother) on 20 minutes before the Army scored three tries (Semesa Rokoduguni 2, Owain Davies) before half time to lead 19–7 at the beak. A further try for the Army (James Farrell) early in the second period saw them extend their lead to 26-7 with half an hour of the match remaining. The Royal Navy staged the most remarkable of comebacks with tries from Gareth Rees and Rhys Dymmock-WIlliams either side of a penalty try to level the scores at 26-26 with 9 minutes remaining. An Owain Davies penalty with 2 minutes to go seemed to seal the win for the Army before Royal Navy fullback landed a 45m penalty of his own to again tie the game 29–29 with less than a minute to go. The draw meant that the Army Navy Trophy was shared but he Royal Navy were Inter Service Champions having beaten the RAF 9–8 at USSG Portsmouth. The RAF had beaten the Army 13–12 at RAF Halton in the opening round of the Inter Services. Royal Navy Number 8 completed a remarkable game which included a try, a yellow card and being named Man of the Match.\n\nThe 2017 Army Navy match was unable to live up to the onfield excitement from the year before. However the 100th match saw another record crowd (81577), the attendance of Prince Harry as Patron of the Match Chairty, Invictus Games Foundation, and an Army win 29-20.\n\nThe 101st Army Navy Match was played at Twickenham on 5 May 2018 with the Army winning 22-14. The match was notable in that the Navy had one man sent off in the first ten minutes of the game and the Army took advantage of their wing overlap to good effect. Army Corporal Matthew Dawson was awarded the Babcock Man of the Match.\n\nThe first Army vs Navy game was held on 13 February 1878. A contemporary newspaper The Broad Arrow gave the following account of the match:\n\"A fine exhibition of football delighted the somewhat small number of spectators. Bush scored the first try for the Navy from a scrummage near the line. The goal was kicked by Orford. A band of naval spectators who had taken up their position beneath a white ensign mounted on the roof of a drag greeted this score with great cheering. The greasy state of the ground was not favourable for any great display of running. Encouraged by a cry from their supporters 'Come on Navy, Force the Passage of the Straights' the Navy mounted great pressure and scored a touch down. In the second half the Navy scored a second try. Wrench of the Army took advantage of some bad passing by the Navy and scored the Army try: The goal was kicked but this ended the scoring and the Navy deservedly won the first match between the Services.\"\n\nThe full version of the report from the Broad Arrow seems to suggest that the correct quote of 'Force the Passage of the Straits' was used.\n\nThe Army selectors made a generous contribution towards the Navy victory by selecting a Royal Artillery officer, R Bannatyne, as Team Captain. He was serving overseas at the time and received no notification of his selection. As a result, he was absent for the game. The situation was further confounded by the fact that another Army player arrived late and missed a good part of the match.\n\nThe teams were:\n\nThe Army Rugby Union was formed in 1906 whilst the exact date of formation of the Royal Navy Rugby Union is shrouded in doubt but is likely to have been towards the end of 1907, after the 1st official Army v Navy Match. February 1907 was when the first match organised by the two Services in a formal manner was played, with Surg Lt George Levick RN acting as the Match Secretary. The match was held at the Queen's Club, West Kensington and was won by the Officers of the Royal Navy 15-14. The match was played at Queen's Club until 1914. After the First World War the first match was hosted by Twickenham in 1920 and the game has been played there ever since.\n\nNavy - Navy blue shorts, socks and shirt.\n\nArmy - White shorts, red shirt and socks.\n\nIn the first match of 1878 the Army played in white. The Navy have always played in blue jerseys though in 1955 their shorts were white.\n\nThe first eight matches were played at Queen's Club. Currently the 101 matches have resulted in 62 Army wins, 35 Navy wins and 4 draws which includes the thrilling 29-29 draw in 2016. The Royal Navy won the first match in 1907 but the Army have won the other anniversary matches. On 7 March 1936 the Army won the 25th match 12-3, in 1967 they won the 50th match 6-3, in 1992 they won the 75th match 16-9 and in 2017 they won the 100th match 29-20\n\nIt is quite probable that other matches were played in this time for which records are not known.\n\n\nIn 1920 a Tri-Service competition was created to include the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF). However, the great rivalry between the Army and Navy has continued and their match, now held at the home of the English Rugby Football Union (Twickenham Stadium), remains the highlight of the annual inter-services rugby competition.\n\nArmy victories are shown in ██ red, Royal Navy victories in ██ navy, Royal Air Force victories in ██ light blue.\nTied games and tied seasons are shown in ██ white.\n\n2010 is the only occasion that an Inter Service match has not taken place for a reason apart from World War.

It is believed to have originated among Dutch immigrants in New York City, and is now popular worldwide. While it had long been a popular street activity for African American girls in New York City, the modern sport of Double Dutch originated in the early 1970s with NYPD officers Ulysses Williams and David Walker, who formalized the rules for competition. The first official competition was held in 1974. In the early 1980s, Double Dutch was strongly associated with New York hip hop culture.Competitions in double Dutch range from block parties to the world level. During the spring of 2009, double Dutch became a varsity sport in New York City public high schools.\n\nPlaying double Dutch involves at least three people: one or more jumping, and two turning the ropes. A jumper usually performs tricks that may involve gymnastics or breakdance, and may also incorporate fancy foot movements.\n\nThe 1981 single \"Double Dutch Bus\" by Frankie Smith features African American girls playing this game in the video clip of the song.\n\nThe 1983 single by Malcolm McLaren, \"Double Dutch\" features a number of New York City troupes. It is taken from his debut album Duck Rock.\n\nThe 1991 single by American hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, \"Summertime\" mentions \"girls playing Double Dutch\". It is taken from their fourth studio album, \"Homebase\".\n\n\"Doubletime\", a documentary from Discovery Films, tells the story of the historic meet-up of rope skipping and double Dutch. The film follows two top teams; the Bouncing Bulldogs and the Double Dutch Forces, as they train to compete against each other for the very first time. The competition takes place at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.\n\nIn 2005, Elizabeth Verity, aka Double Dutch Girl, began jumping her way around the U.S. raising money for the United States military. Double Dutch Girl jumped rope in St. Louis, Chicago, Washington and several small towns throughout the Midwest. Ultimately, her goal is to jump rope in all 50 states.\n\nThe 2007 Disney Channel original movie \"Jump In!\" features double Dutch as the central element of its plot. \"Jump In!\" features the Dutch Dragons, based on a real double Dutch team from 1997 in Harlem. \"Jump!\", an award-winning documentary following five teams from around the United States who push their physical and psychological limits in pursuit of winning the World Rope Skipping Championship, also premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival in 2007\n\nIn 2010, Saltare was on season 5 of America's Best Dance Crew and the group featured single rope and double Dutch in their dance routines.\n\nA 2010 PBS documentary, \"New York Street Games\", includes Whoopi Goldberg describing double Dutch.\n\nOn January 15, 2007, in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the Google homepage featured a double Dutch logo with black children playing with white children, emblematic of the realization of Martin Luther King, Jr's \"I Have A Dream\" speech in 1963.\n\nThe game is featured in the Wee Sing production \"Grandpa's Magical Toys\".\n\nThe music video to the 2010 track by DJ Fresh, \"Gold Dust\", centres on double Dutch skipping.\n\nIn the music video of Yves Larock hit 2007 track \"Rise Up\", double Dutch is the theme used.\n\nIn his dual title role of the 2011 movie \"Jack & Jill\", Adam Sandler gives a demonstration of double Dutch jump rope on board the cruise liner.\n\nThere is a double Dutch jump roping competition in the 2015 film \"War Room\".\n\nThe National Double Dutch League holds yearly camps and a Holiday Classic, in which teams from all over the world compete.

It was produced until at least 1915. \n\nThe objective of the game was to throw a wooden ball into a bullseye, the \"gaping mouth\" of the target in cardboard decorated using imagery of Sambo and that could open and close. It was one of many products and media of late 19th century in the United States depicting African Americans as \"beasts\" and associating the black male face Sambo images with racial slur terms such as \"coon\", \"darky\", \"nigger\", and \"pickaninny\". Among these was another Milton Bradley game, \"Darky's Coon Game\". The term \"darkie\" referred to the \"exaggerated physiognomic features\" depicting black people and associated with minstrel shows. In the book \"Ceramic Uncles & Celluloid Mammies: Black Images and Their Influence on Culture\", Patricia Turner reported that she had heard of a black man sitting outside a theatre preceding a minstrel show, with his mouth open and children throwing balls into it for entertainment. The Cuban poet and journalist José Martí witnessed a similar scene at Coney Island and wrote about it.\n\nIt was one of many games produced at the time with a theme involving violence against black people, who were \"encountering growing hostility\" throughout the United States. Another was \"Hit the Dodger! Knock him Out!\". It was also one of the objects produced at the time featuring a mouth and \"black ingestion\" as a stereotype of African Americans, such as the watermelon stereotype, also exemplified by the \"Jolly Nigger Bank\" into which coins are inserted into a mouth-shaped slot. The target consumer for the game was white people, who bought it for their children. These games and images reinforced \"an encompassing theme of domination\" by white people and subordination of black people. Turner states that such products reflected means by which \"American consumers found acceptable ways of buying and selling the souls of black folk\" even after the abolition of slavery in the United States, and the use of black images in advertising \"figured prominently in commodity capitalism\".\n\nToday, the game is considered a collector's item. It is part of collectable black memorabilia, consisting of objects such as dolls, toys, and postcards that include those that are offensive or racist, even the \"most contemptible examples\" of such works. By 1993, there were about 50,000 black memorabilia collectors in the United States, about 70% of whom were African Americans.\n"}

It was founded in the end of 1926. \"Morgnshtern\" increased significantly in influence in the period just preceding the Second World War. In 1937 the organisation had 107 local branches in different parts of the country. Its largest branch was based in Warsaw. In 1936, the Warsaw branch had 956 active members, in 1937 he membership reached around 1500 (making it the largest local sporting organisation in Poland) and 1855 in 1938.\n\n\"Morgnshtern\" was repeatedly targeted by the Polish authorities; between 1929 and 1934, 23 local \"Morgnshtern\" branches were closed down. In 1937 \"Morgnshtern\" had prepared a delegation to take part in the Workers Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, but the Polish government refused to give travel visas to the athletes.\n\nThe development of socialist sports was markedly affected by the rise of fascism in Europe. The socialist sport movement took a more paramilitary character, in order to mobilize anti-fascist defense. In the case of \"Morgnshtern\", the Bund already had experiences from organizing militias against pogroms. Bernand Goldstein, the president of the \"Morgnshtern\" in Warsaw was also the chief of the Bundist Defense Corps (Goldstein himself did however later downplay his role in \"Morgnshtern\", stating that the presidency was merely an honorary position).\n\n\"Morgnshtern\" ceased to function as Poland was occupied by Germany. Many of the athletes of the organisation became resistance fighters during the war. \"Morgnshtern\" was revived after the war. Warsaw \"Jutrznia-Morgnshtern\" is the only remaining \"Morgnshtern\" branch.\n\n\"Morgnshtern\" espoused principles of socialist sporting, seeking to promote proletarian camaraderie and collective achievements, rather than individual competition. These principles had been formulated in the book \"Sport und Politik\" ('Sports and Politics') by Julius Deutsch. Initially the organisation mainly organised sports were large numbers of people could participate at the same time, such as cycling, gymnastics and hiking.\n\nThe most popular activity of \"Morgnshtern\" was gymnastics. This was followed by \"ritmika\" (eurythmics), which mainly had female participants.\n\nHowever, in order to increase recruitment the organisation eventually began opening up for more individually oriented competitive sports such as football, table tennis and boxing. \"Morgnshtern\", although officially disliking football as a sport which glorified individual champions, had a few football teams affiliated to it already in the 1920s. Still though, compared to the \"Shtern\" federation of the Poale Zion Left or bourgeois Jewish sports organisations, \"Morgnshtern\" put very little emphasis on football. In 1930 the Central Organising Committee of \"Morgnshtern\" adopted a resolution on the 'football question', which concluded that the sport could be collective and inclusive if addressed in the right way. In the early 1930s, there were several football teams in Warsaw city affiliated to \"Morgnshtern\". Following the adoption of the 1930 football resolution, the organisation began forming teams for table tennis (a \"Morgnshtern\" athlete formed part of the Polish national delegation at the 1938 World Championship in London), handball, basketball and volleyball.\n\nThe organisation was even more vocally opposed to boxing, and had proposed banning boxing from the Socialist Workers' Sport International at the 1929 SWSI congress. However, the Warsaw branch of \"Morgnshtern\" set up a boxing club in late December 1935, which was rather successful in the late 1930s.\n\nA delegation of \"Morgnshtern\" participated in the 1927 congress of the Socialist Workers' Sport International. \"Morgnshtern\" had a complicated relationship with the Polish Workers' Sport Federation (ZRSS), due to political antagonism between the Bund and the Polish Socialist Party (which dominated the ZRSS). The two organisations clashes at the 1929 Prague congress of the Socialist Workers' Sports International, as \"Morgnshtern\" demanded to be recognized as a separate section and not as an affiliate of the Polish ZRSS. In the end, the congress accepted the demand. \"Morgnshtern\" sent its own delegation to the 1931 Workers Olympics in Vienna.\n\nApart from physical training, \"Morgnshtern\" also organized cultural activities. A mandolin orchestra and a theatre group were run by \"Morgnshtern\" in Vilna. The \"Morgnshtern\" branch in Warsaw organized visits to cinemas and theatres.\n\nThe summers \"Morgnshtern\" would rent a swimming pool, and offer swimming lessons to its members. In the winters, from 1933 onwards, the organisation had an ice-skating rink in Warsaw.\n\nThe full name of the organization was \"Arbeter gezelshaft far fizisher dertsiung \"morgnshtern\" in poyln\" in Yiddish, and \"Robotnicze Stowarzyszenie Wychowania Fizycznego \"Jutrznia\" w Polsce\" in Polish. After the 1929 congress of the Socialist Workers' Sport International, the organisation added and 'Jewish section of the Workers' Sports International' (\"yidishe sektsie fun arbeter sport internatsional\") to its name.\n\nThe emblem of \"Morgnshtern\" featured a javelin thrower, illustrated in the style of a classic Greek statue, in front of belching smokestacks. The emblem also had the name of the organisation in Yiddish and Polish.\n"}

In 1955, the museum moved to its current location on Union Avenue near Saratoga race course, at which time inductions into the hall of fame began. Each spring, following the tabulation of the final votes, the announcement of new inductees is made, usually during Kentucky Derby Week in early May. The actual inductions are held in mid-August during the Saratoga race meeting.\n\nThe Hall of Fame's nominating committee selects eight to ten candidates from among the four Contemporary categories (male horse, female horse, jockey and trainer) to be presented to the voters. Changes in voting procedures that commenced with the 2010 candidates allow the voters to choose multiple candidates from a single Contemporary category, instead of a single candidate from each of the four Contemporary categories. For example, in 2016, two female horses (Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta) were inducted at the same time.\n\nThe museum also houses a large collection of art, artifacts, and memorabilia that document the history of horse racing from the eighteenth century to the present.\n\nThe museum first opened its doors in 1951, at which time it occupied a single room in Saratoga's Canfield Casino. The establishment was supported by the city of Saratoga Springs, which donated $2,500, the Saratoga Racing Association, which donated $5,000, and various patrons of the sport, who also donated various pieces of art and memorabilia. The first item in the museum's collection was a horseshoe worn by the great Lexington.\n\nIn 1955, the museum relocated to its current location on Union Avenue, close to the main entrance of Saratoga Race Course. Inductions into the hall of fame began at the same time. Since then, the museum has expanded several times to allow for the display of its extensive art collection and more multimedia displays on the history of the sport.\n\nIn the early years, inductions to the hall of fame were based on the evaluation of a panel of racing historians. In 1955, a group of 9 horses from the earliest years of the American turf were inducted. The 1956 class included 11 horses that raced around the turn of the century, while the 1957 class included 10 horses that raced up to the mid-thirties. Since then, the classes have been significantly smaller as the inductions shifted to more contemporary horses. Under current rules, a horse must have been retired for a minimum of five full calendar years to be eligible for the hall of fame. Thoroughbreds remain eligible in the contemporary category between five and 25 calendar years following their final racing year. Thoroughbreds retired for more than 25 calendar years may become eligible through the Historic Review Committee.\nSource: National Museum of Racing and Hall\n\nContemporary jockeys become eligible for the Hall of Fame after they have been licensed for at least 20 years, and remain eligible until 25 years after retirement.

{"id": "223199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=223199", "title": "Parkour", "text": "Parkour\n\nParkour () is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training. Practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement (crawling) and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation. Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.\n\nParkour is as an activity that can be practiced alone or with others and is usually carried out in urban spaces, though it can be done anywhere. Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.\n\nParkour was developed in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David and the latter's group of friends, the self-styled \"Yamakasi\", during the late 1980s. The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi.\n\nThe word \"parkour\" derives from \"parcours du combattant\" (obstacle course), the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by Georges Hébert. Raymond Belle used the term \"les parcours\" to encompass all of his training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement. His son, David, further developed his father's methods and achieved success as a stuntman, and one day on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé. Koundé suggested he change the \"c\" of \"parcours\" to a \"k\" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent \"s\" for the same reason, forming \"parkour\".\n\nA practitioner of parkour is called a \"traceur\", with the feminine form being \"traceuse\". They are nouns derived from the French verb \"\", which normally means \"to trace\", as in \"tracing a path\", in reference to drawing. The verb \"tracer\" used familiarly means: \"to hurry up\". The term \"traceur\" was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.\n\nA \"jam\" refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.\n\nIn Western Europe, a forerunner of parkour was developed by French naval officer Georges Hébert, who before World War I promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in Africa. He noted, \"their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature.\" His rescue efforts during the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on Saint-Pierre, Martinique, reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism. Hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of Reims in France. Hébert set up a \"méthode naturelle\" (\"natural method\") session consisting of ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, balancing, throwing, lifting, self-defence and swimming. These were intended to develop \"the three main forces\": energetic (willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness), moral (benevolence, assistance, honour, and honesty) and physical (muscles and breath). During World War I and World War II, teaching continued to expand, becoming the standard system of French military education and training. Inspired by Hébert, a Swiss architect developed a \"parcours du combattant\"—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses.\n\nBorn in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle was the son of a French physician and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.\nRaymond's son, David Belle, was born in 1973. He experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.\n\nThrough conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called \"parcours\". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.\n\nDavid initially trained on his own, and after moving to Lisses, found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together. The group eventually included David Belle, Sébastien Foucan, Châu Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perrière.\n\nThe group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold. For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing. During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot. At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.\n\nRespecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.\n\nHumility was an important principle. No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.\n\nTo join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining. Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently — \"to create the means to be yourself\" — and there was a complete trust within the group. Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour. If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.\n\nIn 1997, David Belle's brother Jean-François invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in Paris. For the performance, the group named themselves \"Yamakasi\", from the Congolese Lingala \"ya makási\", meaning strong in one's person, or \"strong man, strong spirit\". Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: \"\"l'art du déplacement\" (French for \"the art of movement\"). The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-François also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name \"parkour\" to describe their activity (see § Etymology above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term \"l'art du déplacement\" (see § Derivative terminologies and disciplines below).\n\nNational parkour organizations include the World Freerunning and Parkour Federation, established in 2007, who have worked with MTV to produce Parkour related shows.\n\nInternational Gymnastics Federation (FIG) added parkour as one of their disciplines in 2017, receiving lots of opposition. Programme includes Speed-Run (Sprint) and Freestyle. They launched FIG Parkour World Cup in 2018, first event was held on 6–8 April 2018. The first World Championships are planned for 2020.\n\nAccording to Williams Belle, the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because he wants it \"to be alive\" and \"for people to use it\". Châu Belle explains it is a \"type of freedom\" or \"kind of expression\"; that parkour is \"only a state of mind\" rather than a set of actions, and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers. Traceur Dylan Baker says, \"Parkour also influences one's thought processes by enhancing self-confidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles\". A study by \"Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence\" (Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) in France found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do.\n\nAcademic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space, metropolitan life, and embodiment.\n\nA newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of \"human reclamation\". Andy Tran of Urban Evolution clarifies it as \"a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being. It teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy. It teaches us to touch the world and interact with it, instead of being sheltered by it.\" Another traceur writes, \"It is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements, it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour.\"\n\nA campaign was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry. In the words of Erwan Le Corre: \"Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore.\" Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, \"Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'\" This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure. \n\nIn his 2009 book \"Parkour\", David Belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. \"When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better.\" Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. \"When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: \"No, I am going to show you how \"I\" do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else.\"\n\nThe philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts. In an interview with \"The New Yorker\", David Belle acknowledges the influence: \"There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?\". In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. \"So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before.\" In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: \"If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one.\"\n\nBelle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, \"Precision is all about being measured,\" and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master. \"With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times.\" To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.\n\nWhile there is no official list of \"moves\" in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others, and there are a number of movements considered fundamental. Some examples of common movements are:\n\nParkour is practiced without equipment of any kind. Practitioners normally train wearing light, non-restrictive casual clothing. Traceurs who wear gloves are rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback. Light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged. Practitioners often use minimalist shoes, sometimes as a progression to bare feet, for better sensitivity and balance, while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps. Barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—as David Belle noted, \"bare feet are the best shoes.\" Various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning. Many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour.\n\nParkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities. Although efforts are being made to create places for it, many traceurs do not like the idea, as it is contradictory to parkour's values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom. Traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures. Concerns have been raised regarding trespassing, damage of property, and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries. Many parkour organizations around the globe support the \"Leave No Trace\" initiative, an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the Seattle nonprofit \"Parkour Visions\" in 2008, promoting safety, respect for the spaces used and their other users, and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found.\n\nConcerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off high buildings. They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height, with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops. Some practitioners of Parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.\n\nBecause parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment, many parkour experts tend to view serious physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said \"Thinking you're going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that. Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task.\" There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.\n\nAmerican traceur Mark Toorock said injuries are rare \"because participants rely not on what they can't control – wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing – but their own hands and feet,\" but Lanier Johnson, executive director of the American Sports Medicine Institute, noted that many of the injuries are not reported.\n\nInitially featured in films of French director/producer Luc Besson, parkour was first introduced to the British public by the BBC One station trailer \"Rush Hour\". It featured David Belle leaping across London's rooftops from his office to home, in an attempt to catch his favourite BBC programme, and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used. This advertisement, along with others for Coca-Cola, Nike, and Toyota, had a large-scale impact on public awareness of parkour.\n\nThe creation of parkour show-reels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour, and is common in the parkour community. \"Jump London\" is a 2003 documentary explaining some of the background of parkour, culminating with Sébastien Foucan, Johann Vigroux, and Jérôme Ben Aoues demonstrating their parkour skills. \"Jump London\" changed the presence of parkour in the UK almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs. It was followed by \"Jump Britain\" in 2005. Both Jump films were shown in over 80 countries exposing the discipline and its philosophy to an unprecedented global audience and are cited by numerous practitioners as their motivation for taking up the discipline.\n\nThe Australian version of \"60 Minutes\" broadcast a segment about parkour on 16 September 2007, featuring Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.\n\nParkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines, which has been particularly attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation. For example, in 2010 \"The New York Times\" published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the parkour community. In 2014, the BBC covered youth parkour participation in Jammu and Kashmir. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.\n\nParkour has become a popular element in action sequences, with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers. The first director to do so was Luc Besson, for the film \"Taxi 2\" in 1998, followed by \"Yamakasi\" in 2001 featuring members of the original Yamakasi group, and its sequel \"Les fils du vent\" in 2004. Also in 2004, Besson wrote \"District 13\", another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences, starring David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli, followed by the sequel \"\" in 2009 and remade in English as \"Brick Mansions\" in 2014. In 2006 the film \"Casino Royale\" featured Sébastien Foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie, sparking renewed media interest in parkour. Along with \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" (2007), \"Casino Royale\" is credited with starting a new wave of Parkour-inspired stunts in Western film and television. Parkour was prominent in \"Live Free or Die Hard\" (2007), again with stuntman/actor Cyril Raffaelli, and \"\" (2010), choreographed by David Belle. Several films besides \"Yamakasi\" are about thieves who use parkour, such as \"Breaking and Entering\" (2006), \"Run\" (2013), and \"Tracers\" (2015). The 2011 film \"Freerunner\" is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival. Parkour also featured in \"Dhoom 3\" (2013) and \"Aadhi\" (2018).\n\nMTV's show \"Ultimate Parkour Challenge\" premiered as a one-hour special in October 2009 starring the athletes of the World Freerunning & Parkour Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode series of the same name. The athletes were Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, Ryan Doyle, Michael Turner, Oleg Vorslav, Ben Jenkin, Daniel Arroyo, Pip Andersen and King David. The programme format was a two-part weekly competition in different Southern California locations.\n\nActor Stephen Amell learned parkour at Tempest Academy in preparation for his role as Oliver Queen in the television series \"Arrow\", and co-star Caity Lotz is also a practitioner.\n\nModern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major game-play elements. The \"Assassin's Creed\" series makes heavy use of parkour movement (called freerunning in the game). The \"Mirror's Edge\" games are heavily inspired by parkour, consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles. \"Brink\" introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter. \"Prince of Persia\" and \"Dying Light\" include a central parkour mechanic, while \"Crackdown\" and \"Crackdown 2\" include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects. \"Tony Hawk's American Wasteland\" allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard. \"Tron Evolution\"s basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira.\n\nAlthough parkour itself grew out of military obstacle-course training, it has become a separate discipline. After the attention that parkour received following the 2006 film \"Casino Royale\", military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training. A physical trainer with the Royal Marines trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of introducing some of their techniques to his own students. Colorado Parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the U.S. military and one San Diego staff sergeant trained US Marines in parkour.\n\nIn October 2018, WIRED magazine issued a report (\"Watch Boston Dynamics' Humanoid Robot Do Parkour\") that included some videos showing a humanoid robot doing parkour. (\"See also\" the later article, by the same author, called \"How Boston Dynamics' Robot Videos Became Internet Gold\".)\n\nIn September 2003, Mike Christie's documentary \"Jump London\", starring Sébastien Foucan, was released. In the documentary, the term \"freerunning\" was used as an attempt to translate \"parkour\", in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience. Foucan decided to keep using the term \"freerunning\" to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle's methods.\n\nThe remaining seven \"Yamakasi\" members continued to use the term \"\"l'art du déplacement\", also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien's freerunning, \"l'art du déplacement\" was less about the hard discipline from the original \"Yamakasi\" group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term \"parkour\", saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.\n\nBoth parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression. Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29513740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29513740", "title": "Shea Rowing Center", "text": "Shea Rowing Center\n\nThe C. Bernard Shea Rowing Center is the boathouse for the Princeton University rowing programs. Located on Lake Carnegie in Princeton, New Jersey, the center consists of the Class of 1887 Boathouse and the Richard Ottesen Prentke ‘67 Training Center. The Shea Center was dedicated on October 7, 2000.\n\nRowing began at Princeton in 1870 with a half-dozen undergraduates and two boats, which the students taught themselves to row on the Delaware and Raritan Canal. By 1874, the Princeton Boating Club had been formed and had obtained a wood-framed boathouse on the canal. But by 1884, the canal had become so busy with steam-powered boat traffic that rowing was forced to cease. Early in the 20th century, former coxswain Howard Russell Butler convinced Andrew Carnegie to create a lake at Princeton. When some lakeside property owners demanded to sell their entire farms, Carnegie balked at providing full financing, Butler and a group of eleven other alumni generously stepped in and purchased over a hundred acres of land, 89 of which were then given to the University. Other alumni gave hundreds of acres of land to the University at the same time. The lake was finally completed in 1906.\n\nWith a fine body of water on which to compete, rowing began again in 1911. In 1913, the Class of 1887 Boathouse was donated to the University on the occasion of the 25th reunion of the Class; they had been the last class to row on the Canal. The structure initially accommodated only 3 full eights of heavyweight oarsmen.\n\nAs Princeton added new rowing programs, the building housed heavyweight, lightweight, women’s and lightweight women’s crew programs. There were a number of piecemeal modifications over the years to accommodate the additional athletes, leaving a building that was maze-like and confusing. By 1997, the boathouse was serving more than 160 athletes on a daily basis, and was packed beyond overflowing. Additionally, the building was falling into disrepair. Indeed, a 1996 meeting of the Princeton University Rowing Association (PURA) was punctuated by a window falling out. Subsequent to this meeting, PURA president Dick Prentke ‘67 initiated the effort to work with University to pursue a full-scale renovation and addition.\n\nPURA turned to architect and former lightweight rower Jeff Peterson ’84 to explore initial concepts for the project. Peterson's firm at that time, Architectural Resources Cambridge, was eventually hired to design the project. After the project, Peterson started Peterson Architects, a firm that focuses primarily on boathouses.\n\nPURA raised more than $8 million from over 1200 donors for the project, including a $4 million gift by Irene C. Shea in memory of her husband C. Bernard Shea ‘1916. Mr. Shea had been a student when the 1887 Boathouse opened and was an avid fan of rowing and all things Princeton.\n\nConstruction commenced in June 1999. Crews were able to partially occupy the 1887 Boathouse for boat storage in the spring of 2000. The project was completed in time for full occupancy in the fall of 2000.\n\nAn unusually heavy rainfall in April 2007 caused the water level in Lake Carnegie to rise several feet, flooding Shea Rowing Center and suspending activities for several days. After the flood, the University engaged Peterson Architects to repair the facility and to mitigate potential damage from future floods.\n\nThe C. Bernard Shea Rowing Center serves as a gateway to the Princeton Campus, the first visible buildings when approaching from the east. The center consists of the original Class of 1887 Boathouse (22,000 s.f.) and the Richard Ottesen Prentke Training Center (13,500 s.f.). To achieve architectural consistency, the newer Prentke Center reiterates the bay spacing, hipped roofs, and tripartite window configurations of the original building. \nThe tower of the 1887 Boathouse is the center's entry and focal point. On its second floor, it features a double-height sky-lit space with mahogany flooring, benches and wainscoting. A gallery extending to the west features historical photographs, overlooks the lake and provides access to shower and locker facilities. The gallery arrives at a grand open-timbered club room with lounge seating, trophy cases, and video facilities. \nThe Prentke Center includes two bays for small boats, and a moving-water rowing tank. In the tank, the broadly arched window evokes the arches of the Washington Street Bridge. The upper level contains three large workout spaces framed with heavy timber trusses. These rooms are finished with mahogany wainscot and athletic rubber flooring.\n\nThe Shea Rowing Center has won a number of architectural design awards, including a 2005 Boston Society of Architects Honor Award for Design and a 2001 Facility of Merit Award from Athletic Business Magazine. It was also recognized by Boathouse Finder as a building of outstanding “Architectural Achievement.”\n"}

The term is often seen as a pejorative, for it implicitly downplays a quarterback's talent or skill by implying that a successful offense is due to a particular scheme or that a quarterback is successful due to his employment under specific circumstances. A system quarterback is usually perceived as having their statistics inflated by a particular strategy. Offensive schemes that tend to feature so-called system quarterbacks are the \"run and shoot\", spread, and, less frequently, spread option offenses. \n\nRuss Lande of \"Sporting News\" traced the term's etymology, or at least currency, to the early 1990s, when two University of Houston quarterbacks failed to carry college success into their professional careers. First, Andre Ware, in head coach Jack Pardee and offensive coordinator John Jenkins's run and shoot offense, had a record-setting 1989 season that culminated in a Heisman Trophy. He was the seventh overall pick in the 1990 NFL Draft, but did not have success in either the National Football League or the Canadian Football League. David Klingler took over for Ware at UH and was the sixth overall pick in the 1992 NFL Draft. He too, failed to find exceptional success in the NFL.\n\nRecently, the appellation was commonly applied to Texas Tech quarterbacks that operated under former head coach Mike Leach and offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen's spread offense. In the 2000s, the school had several different quarterbacks that threw in excess of 4,000 yards in a season. According to some pundits, this demonstrated that the quarterback had simply been an interchangeable part in a prolific passing offense. Some Texas Tech quarterbacks, with their college tenure in parentheses, described as such include:\n\nThe label is not restricted to Texas Tech, however, and pundits and coaches have referred to players from several other schools as benefiting from systems. In 2007, then Hawaii head coach and offensive coordinator June Jones infamously defended his own alleged system quarterback, Colt Brennan, by making the counter-accusation against Tim Tebow of Florida. Players from schools other than Texas Tech that were described as system quarterbacks include:\nTom Brady \nThe derivative and complementary term \"system receiver\" has been used to describe wide receivers under similar circumstances. Wes Welker of Texas Tech and the New England Patriots is one example.\n"}
