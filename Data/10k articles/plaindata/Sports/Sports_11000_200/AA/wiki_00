{"id": "1078913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1078913", "title": "36th Chess Olympiad", "text": "36th Chess Olympiad\n\nThe 36th Chess Olympiad, organized by the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE) and comprising an open and a women's tournament, as well as several events designed to promote the game of chess, took place between October 14 and October 31, 2004, in Calvià on the Spanish island of Majorca. There were 129 teams in the open event and 87 in the women's event. In total, 1204 players were registered (some of whom did not play, though).\n\nBoth tournament sections were officiated by international arbiter Ignatius Leong (Singapore). Teams were paired across the 14 rounds of competition according to the Swiss system. The open division was played over four boards per round, whilst the women's was played over three. In the event of a draw, the tie-break was decided by 1. The Buchholz system; 2. Match points; 3. The Sonneborn-Berger system; and 4. The Median Buchholz system.\n\nThe time control for each game permitted each player 90 minutes for all their moves, with an additional 30 seconds increment for each player after each move, beginning with the first.\n\nThe open division was contested by 129 teams representing 125 nations. Spain, as hosts, fielded three teams, whilst the \"International Braille Chess Association\" (IBCA) and the \"International Physically Disabled Chess Association\" (IPCA) each provided one squad.\n\nLed by first board Vasyl Ivanchuk, the seventh highest-rated player at the tournament, who recorded 9½ points over 13 rounds, and second reserve Sergey Karjakin who, aged just 14 years, won 6 of his 7 games (surrendering a draw only to American Gregory Kaidanov), Ukraine scored all four possible points in each of their first three matches before \"only\" defeating Russia 2½-1½ in the fourth round, eventually accumulating a nearly insurmountable three-point lead after the penultimate round. The Ukrainian team nevertheless scored three points against France and claimed their first title, three points ahead of Russia, who had entered the tournament as the top seed, having brought four of the tournament's nine highest-rated players, and as defending six-time champions.\n\nArmenia, one of just four teams to draw a match with Ukraine, paced by second board Levon Aronian, who did not lose in 12 games, and third board Rafael Vaganian, who scored 8½ points in 11 games, lost 1½-2½ to Russia in the eighth round. Ultimately, on the strength of a 3½-½ final round defeat of Georgia, they tied Russia's 36½ points. Armenia were placed after Russia, though, on the Buchholz tie-breaker system employed by the Olympiad, and finished, as in the previous Olympiad, with the bronze medals. Hosts Spain, led by Alexei Shirov, just managed to squeeze into the top ten.\n\nNotable absentees from the tournament were the no. 1 player in the world, Garry Kasparov, as well as classical World Champion Vladimir Kramnik and his challenger Peter Leko, who were just finishing their championship match (Kramnik retained his title with a 7-7 tie). FIDE Champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov was present, however, and led Uzbekistan to 14th place by going undefeated in his 8 games (+4-0=4).\n\nIn addition to the overall medals, prizes were given out to the best teams in five different seeding groups—in other words, the teams who exceeded their seeding the most. Overall medal winners were not eligible for group prizes.\n\n\nThe women's division was contested by 87 teams representing 84 nations. Spain, as hosts, fielded two teams, whilst the \"International Braille Chess Association\" (IBCA) and the \"International Physically Disabled Chess Association\" (IPCA) each provided one squad.\n\nChina, led by first board Xie Jun (ex-World Champion) and second board Xu Yuhua (future champion), entered the competition as top seed and defending triple champions and quickly took the lead, conceding just two draws in their first five matches They then defeated the silver and bronze medallists from the previous Olympiad, Russia and Poland (each 2-1), in the sixth and eighth rounds, respectively. Eventually they carried a six-point lead into a tenth round match with second placed United States.\n\nSusan Polgar (another ex-World Champion), who entered the tournament as the second highest-rated player and achieved the best performance rating of all, drew Xie Jun, while Irina Krush won her second board game against Xu Yuhua. A draw by Anna Zatonskih against Zhao Xue gave the Americans a 2-1 win over the Chinese team. In rounds eleven and twelve, China drew Hungary and lost to Georgia, whilst the US team defeated Slovakia and then scored a 2½-½ victory over Hungary, drawing within three points of China with two rounds remaining. China, though, defeated sixth-seed India and 12th-seed Slovakia in the final two rounds, scoring four points to preserve what was ultimately a three-point win and to clinch the Vera Menchik Trophy for a fourth consecutive time.\n\nSecond-seed Russia were led by Nadezhda Kosintseva, who won top honours on the first reserve board for scoring 10 points in 12 rounds. The Russians were only in eighth place after ten rounds but had advanced to fourth place entering the penultimate round, where they faced Georgia, who they trailed by half a point. Although first board Maya Chiburdanidze (ex-World Champion) and second board Nana Dzagnidze, who both scored 8½ points for their team over the event, drew their matches, third board Lela Javakhishvili lost to Kosintseva, giving the Russian team a half-point lead over Georgia; although Georgia defeated Ukraine 2½-½ in the final round, Russia managed to secure two points against France, equalling Georgia's total and winning the bronze medals on tie-breaks.\n\nNewly crowned World Champion Antoaneta Stefanova disappointed as captain of the Bulgarian team, scoring only 5½ points in 11 games. Bulgaria eventually finished in 14th place.\n\nIn addition to the overall medals, prizes were given out to the best teams in five different seeding groups—in other words, the teams who exceeded their seeding the most. Overall medal winners were not eligible for group prizes.\n\n\nThe Nona Gaprindashvili Trophy is awarded to the nation that has the best average rank in the open and women's divisions. Where two or more teams are tied, they are ordered by best single finish in either division and then by total number of points scored.\n\nThe trophy, named after the former women's World Champion (1961–78), was created by FIDE in 1997.\n\nPrior to the closing ceremony of the Olympiad, FIDE vice president Zurab Azmaiparashvili was arrested by the local law enforcement as he attempted to ascend the stage. Security officers, in conjunction with local police, did not permit Azmaiparashvili access to tournament organizers, and a struggle ensued after which Azmaiparashvili, having sustained several injuries, was arrested; he secured his release on bail for €500 after having been held for 40 hours, and the charges against him were later dropped.\n\nA Georgian, Azmaiparashvili undertook to inform the presenter of the Nona Gaprindashvili Trophy that the latter ought more clearly to explain Gaprindashvili's contributions to the game of chess (Gaprindashvili had been World Champion for 17 years), but was barred by security. Azmaiparashvili and FIDE averred that Azmaiparashvili was detained and physically accosted despite his having properly and \"clearly [displayed] his VIP credentials\" , whilst representatives of the Spanish chess federation (\"Federación Española de Ajedrez\") and tournament organizers blamed Azmaiparashvili for the incident, saying that he \"without any previous provocation, assaulted [an] agent with a head butt to [the] mouth\" .\n\nHaving been formally recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1999, in preparation for prospective inclusion in future iterations of the Olympic Games, FIDE implemented (in 2001) doping restrictions consistent with those adopted by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Two players, Shaun Press of Papua New Guinea and Bobby Miller of Bermuda, refused, for various reasons, to submit urine samples for analysis. Both players appeared before the FIDE Doping Hearing panel, which decided to cancel the players' performances (Press had scored 7½ points in 14 games, while Miller had scored 3½ points in 9 games), reducing the final score of Papua New Guinea to 15½ (from 23) and that of Bermuda to 18½ (from 22).\n\nConcomitant to the tournaments were several chess-related events planned by the organizing committee of the Olympiad, some under the auspices of FIDE; the events were known collectively as the \"First Chess Festival Calvià 2004\". Within the festival were held simultaneous exhibitions, game demonstrations and lectures by top Spanish players, and several secondary tournaments, including one for amateur players, a rapid chess event for players aged under 16, and one for senior players.\n\nChess classes were introduced into the primary and secondary schools, as well as senior centers, in and around Calvià in an effort to promote chess generally, and chess films were screened on the beaches of Calvià every weeknight during the Olympiad. Chess-oriented art was displayed at an \"International Chess Fair\", with prizes for top works awarded by a jury.\n\n"}

The team is organised by the Brazilian Cricket Association (\"Cricket Brasil\"), which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2002 and an associate member in 2017. However, the national side has a history dating back much longer, with its first recorded international match coming against Argentina in 1888. Regular international competition commenced in the 1920s, and resumed in the 1950s after a gap during World War II. Almost all of Brazil's matches have come against other South American sides, although in recent years the team has participated in several ICC Americas tournaments, which include sides from Central America and North America. At the South American Championships, which commenced in 1995, Brazil has played in all but one edition, with a best finish of second at the 1997 tournament.\n\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Brazil and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\n\nBrazil became an ICC member in 2002. Its ICC tournament debut came in 2006, when Brazil took part in Division Three of the ICC Americas Championship in Suriname.

{"id": "1447367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1447367", "title": "Clock management", "text": "Clock management\n\nIn gridiron football, clock management is the manipulation of a game clock and play clock to achieve a desired result, typically near the end of a match. It is analogous to \"running out the clock\" (and associated counter-tactics) seen in many sports, and the act of trying to hasten the game's end is often referred to by this term. Clock managements strategies are a significant part of American football, where an elaborate set of rules dictates when the game clock stops between downs, and when it continues to run.\n\nUpon kickoff, the clock is started when a member of the receiving team touches the ball, or, if the member of the receiving team touches the ball in their end zone, carries the ball out of the end zone. The clock is stopped when that player is tackled or goes out of bounds. (The clock never starts if the receiving team downs the ball in their own end zone for a touchback.) The clock is then restarted when the offense snaps the ball for their first play and continues to run unless one of the following occurs, in which case the clock is stopped at the end of the play and restarts at the next snap unless otherwise provided:\n\n\n\nIf the clock runs out during a play, the current play is allowed to continue to its conclusion. If the clock runs out between downs, the period ends in American football, but in Canadian football the offense is allowed one last down.\n\nEach team is given three timeouts per half which they can use to stop the clock from running after a play. In the NFL, teams get two timeouts in a preseason or regular season overtime period, or three in a postseason overtime half.\n\nOn a fair-catch punt, the clock starts at the snap and stops at the end of the play.\n\nA team on offense that has the higher score seeks to use as much time as possible. A drive that scores no points may nevertheless benefit the team by taking time off the clock. The team may:\n\n\nThe team may use counterintuitive game plans, such as declining to score or allowing the opponents to score, to accelerate the end of the game.\n\nIf the defense does not have enough time-outs to stop the clock before the ball is turned over on downs, the offense can run out the clock by executing repeated quarterback kneels until the clock runs out. In the NFL and college football, up to 40 seconds can be taken off the clock between plays. The NFL also has a built-in two-minute warning that stops the clock after the play that occurs when the clock hits two minutes ends. In order to successfully run out the clock by kneeling, there must be less than 40 seconds on the clock if the opponent has two time-outs, 1 minute 20 seconds if the opponent has one time-out, or 2 minutes if the defense has no time-outs remaining, at the beginning of the series of downs. The offense can burn further time off the clock by timewasting: keeping the ball live (and the clock running) simply by keeping away from any defensive player, regardless of position on the field.\n\nA team on offense that has the lower score seeks to conserve time. The team may:\n\nA team that is tied or trailing by one or two points but is within the red zone (and thus in easy field goal range) seeks to burn a specific amount of time off the clock, such that they can stop the clock with five or fewer seconds on the clock, so that their placekicker can kick a field goal with no time remaining and win the game.\n\nA team on defense has little control over the pace of the game. It may expend its timeouts to ensure that there is adequate time left on the clock, in case the team regains possession. The defense can make decisions on how to stop the ball carrier based on whether the team is trailing or leading: if the offense is trying to conserve time, the defense can foil that by tackling the ball carrier in-bounds before they can get out of bounds. Defenses likewise can safely devote more personnel to the perimeter and leave the center of the field less defended, as an offense that cannot afford to keep the clock running will have to throw toward the sidelines. Various rules ensure that the defense cannot deliberately commit fouls to manipulate the game clock, and in the most extreme such cases, an unfair act can be declared and the game forfeited to the offense. (Likewise, if the offense commits fouls to burn off time and get extra downs, the clock is reset and unsportsmanlike conduct is called on them.)\n\nIn Canadian football, a team trailing by one point or tied has an additional option: a ball can be kicked from anywhere on the field in that sport, and balls kicked into or through the end zone and not returned score a single point. This allows a team trailing by one to advance the ball upfield, then punt the ball toward the end zone in hopes of tying the game for one point (the player could also drop kick the ball, which would allow the kicking team to win on a field goal if kicked through the uprights). To prevent this scenario, defending teams will place their punter in the end zone to retrieve the ball and kick it back out of the end zone, preventing that single point from being scored.\n\nSeveral of the strategies discussed above for American football above can be used in the Canadian code, however rule differences mean that running out the clock much more difficult:\n\n\nThese differences make for radically different endgames if the team with the lead has the ball. In the NFL, a team can run 120 seconds (2 minutes)--and slightly more in the NCAA--off the clock without gaining a first down (assuming that the defensive team is out of timeouts). In the Canadian game, just over 40 seconds can be run off.\n\n\n"}

They are usually a piece of foam (covered in leather) ranging from 1.5-28 inches thick, covered in a vinyl or plastic lining. The foam ranges in density from relatively firm to very soft.\n\nLanding mats are usually blue, but can also be almost any other color. Mats come in a range of sizes, from very small mats used on the beam, to very large mats, used in the foam pits.\n\nTypically, in both competition and practice, the use of mats is mandatory. On every event except floor exercise, pommel horse and vault, gymnasts may use an additional landing mat, without deduction, which may be adjusted for distance.\n\nThese are thin mats that fasten around the balance beam. They are used only in training to give gymnasts training high-level skills additional protection and a wider landing space while working on the apparatus. Makeshift beam pads can also be constructed from soft mats placed over the beam surface, if necessary.\n\nBlocks are firm, trapezoid or rectangular shaped mats. They can be attached to other blocks via velcro and straps. Blocks are routinely used as step-stools for gymnasts working on the bars or beam and as practice vaulting surfaces.\n\nTypically, these mats are extremely thick and soft, and are used when an athlete is learning a new, high-impact skill.\n\nThese mats are thin, firm mats about twelve feet in length. They usually have alternating color panels and can be folded, stacked and attached to other mats via velcro strips at the ends. Normally used for practicing tumbling moves, these mats may be stacked to provide a protective surface for gymnasts working on the low balance beam, or provide a means for a gymnast to reach the bars or rings. They have a history of usage in gymnastics, martial arts and physical education classes. Schools generally purchase new folding mats once every 7 years. These mats are perfect for providing a level of protection for the body from high impact collisions with hard solid surfaces such as hardwood or concrete flooring. There are two main categories of foam used in these types of mats, cross-linked polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam.\n\nCross-linked polyethylene foam is a very solid and sturdy foam, when being used in a folding panel gym mat—it is generally accepted to be at a standard of 1 3/8\" thickness. Mats with this type of foam would be considered for professional use in sporting events.\n\nThe foam is firm, but not as firm as the cross-linked polyethylene foam used in 1 3/8\" thick models. Because of the lack of firmness mats made with this type of foam generally use specifically 2\" thick 100 ILD open cell 4.5 lb. density polyurethane foam. Generally accepted uses of mats with this kind of foam are practice venues, home use, and youth amateur sports events.\n\nEach mat although maybe of different foam generally have similar vinyl enclosures. 14 to 18 ounce polyester laminated vinyl is generally used in all folding mat applications. The vinyl covers should be fire-retardant (class - A), puncture and mildew resistant and have antibacterial properties to help maintain good hygiene. Velcro on each end of the mat allows a near seamless connection to additional mats for tumbling runs or expansive areas.\n\nRanging from 4 feet x 8 feet to 6 feet x 12 feet, sizes usually only matter when limited by space or personal preference. In most cases – like in gymnastics – multiple mats are purchased to be strung together via Velcro to create the ultimate sure-footed tumbling experience. Generally mats used for gymnasiums and gymnastics mats come in 2-foot-wide panels and is why many in the industry call them folding panel mats or folding mats. The 2-foot-wide panels allow for ease in both set up and clean up when using the mats to becoming the perfect compact size for storage.\n\nAlso known as wedge mats, cheese mats or simply \"the cheese,\" are firm mats shaped like right triangles. They are mainly used to teach and train beginning and intermediate gymnastics skills such as rolls, walkovers and handsprings.\n\nThese firm mats are used on vault. They are U-shaped and surround the springboard on three sides. In the event that the gymnast's foot misses the springboard during his or her vault attempt, he or she can push off the mat for momentum and, hopefully, avoid a serious injury. Under the current \"Code of Points\", performing a Yurchenko-style vault without the safety mat results in an automatic score of zero.\n\nThese mats are thin and soft, and are usually white or red in color to distinguish them from the other mats and floor exercise area. They are used on the floor exercise to lessen the \"sting,\" or impact, of tumbling run landings and for dismounts on the beam or floor. Sting mats are routinely used in training, but are only rarely used or permitted in competition.\n"}
{"id": "464883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=464883", "title": "Miracle (2004 film)", "text": "Miracle (2004 film)\n\nMiracle is a 2004 American sports docudrama about the United States men's hockey team, led by head coach Herb Brooks, portrayed by Kurt Russell, that won the gold medal in the 1980 Winter Olympics. The American team's victory over the heavily favored Soviet professionals in the medal round was dubbed the Miracle on Ice. \"Miracle\" was directed by Gavin O'Connor and written by Eric Guggenheim and Mike Rich. It was released on February 6, 2004.\n\nThe University of Minnesota ice hockey head coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) interviews with the United States Olympic Committee for the national team coach's job, discussing his philosophy on how to beat the Soviet team, calling for changes to the practice schedule and strategy. Brooks meets his assistant coach Craig Patrick (Noah Emmerich) at the tryouts in Colorado Springs. Brooks selects a preliminary roster of 26, indifferent to the preferences of senior USOC hockey officials. He convinces Walter Bush (Sean McCann), the executive director of the committee, that he has their best interests at heart. Bush reluctantly agrees to take the heat from the committee for Brooks' decisions.\n\nDuring the initial practice, tempers flare as forward Rob McClanahan and defenseman Jack O'Callahan get into a fight based on college rivalry. Brooks bluntly tells the players that they are to let go of old rivalries and start becoming a team. As practices continue, Brooks uses unorthodox methods to winnow the roster down to 20 players. The players themselves worry about being cut at any time, knowing that Brooks himself was the last player cut from the 1960 Olympic hockey team that won the gold medal, so he will do anything to win. \n\nDuring an exhibition game against Norway in Oslo that ends in a 3–3 tie, Brooks notices the players are distracted and not playing up to their potential. After the game, he orders them back on the ice to skate \"Herbies\", which they do for an extended period of time even after the rink manager turns off the power. Exhausted, forward Mike Eruzione interrupts Brooks and cries out that he plays for the United States. Getting the answer he wanted all along, Brooks finally tells the players they are done. Eventually, the team comes together, with the players thinking of themselves as a family representing the United States. The team plays the Soviets in an exhibition game at Madison Square Garden. The Soviets manhandle the young American team, winning by a score of 10–3. During the game, O'Callahan receives an injury that could keep him out of the entire Olympics, and starting goaltender Jim Craig is told he may be benched in favor of back-up goalie Steve Janaszak. Craig ends up retaining his starting job when the coach brings him to realize that he hasn't been giving his very best.\nAs the 1980 Winter Olympics begins, the Americans trail Sweden 2–1 in the first game. Brooks fires up the team during the break by accusing an injured McClanahan of quitting. McClanahan ends up playing despite his injury, which inspires the team and Bill Baker scores a goal with less than a minute remaining in the third period for a dramatic 2–2 tie. They then follow up with a 7–3 win over heavily favored Czechoslovakia. As the Olympics continue, the team defeats Norway, Romania, and West Germany to earn a spot in the medal round. The Americans are considered overwhelming underdogs to the Soviets in the first medal round game. The game begins and the Soviets score the first goal. Then O'Callahan, having healed enough from his injury, enters the game for the first time. He makes an immediate impact by heavily checking Vladimir Krutov on a play that leads to a goal by Buzz Schneider. The Soviets score again to retake the lead, but in the final seconds the Soviet goalie Vladislav Tretiak stops a long shot by Dave Christian, but Mark Johnson gets the rebound and scores with less than one second left in the period.\nDuring the first intermission the Soviet coach replaces Tretiak with backup Vladimir Myshkin. In the second period the Soviets score a goal to go up 3–2. Early in the final period the Soviet team is called for a penalty, giving the Americans a man advantage. Johnson scores his second goal of the game just as the penalty is about to expire. Later, Eruzione puts them ahead 4–3 with 10 minutes left. The Americans hold off the Soviets to win the game, completing one of the biggest upsets in sports history. Two days later the team would go on to defeat Finland 4–2 to win the gold medal. The movie ends with Brooks staring out over his team with pride as the entire team crowds together on the gold medal platform.\n\nGavin O'Connor directed and Mark Ciardi produced the movie. Both are drawn to inspirational stories and they decided to take on the \"Greatest Sports Moment of the 20th Century\". They chose to focus on the determination and focus of coach Herb Brooks. O'Connor knew from the beginning that he wanted to cast Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks because he needed someone with an athletic background and a fiery passion for sports. The casting of the team consisted of real hockey players to give the film a raw and accurate feel. O'Connor figured it would be easier to teach hockey players to act than to teach actors to play hockey. On-ice tryouts were held in New York, Boston, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Vancouver. Another tryout was held in Vancouver for the Soviet and European teams.\n\nThere are a total of 133 different hockey plays in the film. To accomplish this, the directors turned to ReelSports Solutions, who had helped with the producers on a previous movie, \"The Rookie\". The ReelSports team referred to coach Herb Brooks for information on practices, plays, equipment, and uniform styles. Each fight and stunt scene was choreographed to ensure the actors' safety. Players went through a six-week training camp to relearn the game in older equipment.\n\nCoach Brooks died in a car accident shortly after the film's principal photography was completed. The movie is dedicated to Brooks's memory. The dedication states at the end of the film, \"He never saw it. He lived it.\"\n\nThe film states that Vladislav Tretiak was Viktor Tikhonov's \"bread and butter\" after being pulled from the net at the start of the second period of the game in the Olympics. The fact is that Tikhonov was not named head coach until 1977 and Tretiak was one from the old guard.\n\n\nThe movie grossed $19,377,577 on its opening weekend, February 8, on 2,605 screens. It closed with a worldwide gross of $64,445,708.\n\nThe movie was released with a rating of PG, meaning that Parental Guidance is suggested. \n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 158 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Kurt Russell's performance guides this cliche-ridden tale into the realm of inspirational, nostalgic goodness.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nElvis Mitchell of \"The New York Times\" stated that the movie \"does a yeoman's job of recycling the day-old dough that passes for its story.\" Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" referred to the movie as \"a classically well-made studio entertainment that, like \"The Rookie\" of a few years back, has the knack of being moving without shamelessly overdoing a sure thing.\" O'Callahan said in an interview that while the fight between him and McClanahan was fictional the film accurately portrayed the \"pretty intense\" rivalry between Boston University and Minnesota players, and was overall \"pretty darn close\" to actual events.\n\nAs of January 2017 \"Miracle\" was rated the number two sports movie of all time with a rating of 8.85 out of 10 in the ongoing poll at \"Sports In Movies\", after maintaining the number one spot for several years.\n\n\"Miracle\" won the Best Sports Movie ESPY Award for 2004.\n\nIn 2006, the American Film Institute nominated this film for AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers. And In 2008, AFI nominated this film for its Top 10 Sports Films list.\n\n\n"}

Parallel bars are used in artistic gymnastics and also for physical therapy and home exercise. Gymnasts may optionally wear grips when performing a routine on the parallel bars, although this is uncommon.\n\nThe apparatus consists of two parallel bars that are held parallel to, and elevated above, the floor by a metal supporting framework. The bars are composed of wood or other material, with an outer coating of wood. The vertical members of the supporting framework are adjustable so the height of the bars above the floor and distance between the bars can be set optimally for each gymnast.\n\n\nThe parallel bars (in German \"Barren\") were invented by Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in Berlin. In 1819 the first transportable parallel bars were described. In 1856 in Germany Hermann Otto Kluge used tubes to make the parallel bars and the horizontal bar adjustable. He used them in his gym. In Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, published between 1873-1877, their use for exercise is described.\n\nA routine performed on the parallel bars must include various elements that depend on the gymnast's competitive level. A typical performance will involve swinging skills in a support position (on the hands), a hanging position, and an upper arm position (resting on the inner bicep). Also, parallel bar routines often feature a strength or static hold skill such as an L-sit or handstand. Each routine ends with a dismount from either the ends of the bars or the side of the apparatus.\n\nA parallel bar routine should contain at least one element from all element groups:\n\nDeductions are taken for form and exactness of elements performed. There are specific deductions for adjusting hand position in handstand and not controlling swing elements; swing type elements should momentarily show handstand.\n\n"}

The Lido consists of a 50-metre main pool (with reserved lanes), a children's pool, and paddling pool. All the pools are heated to over .\n\nOn 1 April 1996 a charitable trust, Sandford Lido Limited, took over operational control of Sandford Parks Lido signing a 25-year lease with Cheltenham Borough Council and is open to the general public from May to the end of September each year.\n\nSandford Parks Lido was opened on 25 May 1935, the ceremony started at 3pm with a procession of open-top motor cars travelling from the Municipal Offices to the Lido, carrying the Mayor of Cheltenham and his wife, along with dignitaries from neighbouring cities and towns.\n\nThe heating of the pool was a unique feature and one of the first tasks of the staff was to stoke the coal fire boiler. As many Lidos in the country remain unheated, first-time visitors to Sandford Parks Lido are often surprised that the pool water is heated.\n\nAfter the opening of the indoor swimming facilities in Cheltenham the future of the Lido came into question. There were times when the Lido would break even or show a slight surplus, however after a poor summer in 1982 the Lido faced the first calls to close or to sell the site. Lido friends rallied round, a public petition was organised and the Lido was protected for the next few years. \n\nBy the early 1990s the Lido was under considerable threat again. Cheltenham Borough Council had carried out a feasibility study of the complex including a radar survey of both pools. The radar survey confirmed that both pools were on unstable ground and the repairs had failed. Structurally they gave the main pool a life expectancy of only ten years.\n\nIn negotiation with Cheltenham Borough Council a way forward was developed and by 1996 a charitable Trust had been formed with members of the Friends of the Lido. On 1 April 1996 the trust took over operational control\n\nThe Charity has invested over £370,000 on refurbishment and site improvements since taking control and by 2005, £250,000 had been raised from direct donations. Together with £50,000 from Gloucestershire Environmental Trust with Landfill Tax contributions from Cory Environmental Ltd and a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £382,500, work was able to commence in September 2006 on the main pool refurbishment project.\n\nThe refurbishment project will stabilise the main pool structure and refresh the pool deck and promenade paving.

With a current seating capacity of 81,044, it has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947.\n\nThe Santiago Bernabéu is one of the world's most famous football venues. It has hosted the final of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 and will be the host of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Final. The final matches for the 1964 European Nations' Cup and the 1982 FIFA World Cup, were also held at the Bernabéu, making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a UEFA European Championship, a FIFA World Cup final and a Copa Libertadores final. \n\nOn 22 June 1944, the Banco Mercantil e Industrial bank granted a credit to Santiago Bernabéu and Rafael Salgado for the purchase of the land adjacent to the old Ramin Amin. On 5 September 1944, architects Manuel Muñoz Monasterio and Luis Alemany Soler were hired and the structure on the site began to give way to the new stadium. On 27 October 1944, construction work on the stadium began.\n\nThe () was inaugurated on 14 December 1947 with a match between Real Madrid and the Portuguese side Os Belenenses, which resulted in a 3–1 victory for \"Los Blancos\". The stadium had an initial capacity of 75,145 spectators, 27,645 of which had seats (7,125 covered) and 47,500 for standing fans. Sabino Barinaga was the first player to score in the new stadium.\n\nThe first major renovation occurred in 1955. On 19 June of that year, the stadium expanded to accommodate 125,000 spectators. Thus, the Madrid coliseum became the biggest stadium of all the participants of the newly established European Cup.\n\nOn 4 January 1955, after the General Assembly of Members Compromisaros, it was decided that the stadium adopt its present name in honour of club President Santiago Bernabéu.\n\nIn May 1957, Real Madrid used electric stadium lighting in a game against Sport Recife of Brazil.\n\nThe next big changes did not occur until the early 1980s with the hosting of the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain. The stadium had to adapt to the changing times and with this, architects Rafael Luis Alemany and Manuel Salinas were hired for the stadium's renovation project. The brothers were sons of Luis Alemany Soler, who carried out the original construction project next to Muñoz Monasterio. The work lasted 16 months and had a cost of 704 million pesetas (US $4.7 million), of which 530 million was paid by the City of Madrid.\n\nThe improvements included a number of points. First, FIFA forced two-thirds of the seating area to be covered. For this reason, Real Madrid installed a roof covering the perimeter of the first and second tiers of seating, except the east side. The stadium's capacity was reduced from 120,000 to 98,000 spectators, 24,550 of which were covered by the new roof. The project also involved remodeling the façade, the installation of new electronic signs in the north and south ends, as well as the renovation of the press areas, lockers rooms, access, and ancillary areas.\n\nThe stadium hosted four matches in the World Cup: three second-round Group Two matches (West Germany vs. England, West Germany vs. Spain, and Spain vs. England) and the prestigious final match (Italy vs. West Germany).\n\nFollowing a series of spectator fatalities in the 1980s (most notably the Heysel Stadium in Belgium and the Hillsborough Stadium in England), English authorities released the Taylor Report on how to improve football spectator safety in English venues. UEFA followed suit across Europe. The stadium was forced to create separate shortcuts to different stadium sections and seats for all spectators. In the 1990s, the Santiago Bernabéu went through a large expansion and remodeling. The board of Ramón Mendoza awarded the project to Gines Navarro Construcciones, S.A. The work started on 7 February 1992 and concluded on 7 May 1994 with a final cost of more than 5 billion pesetas, substantially raising the debt of the club, having no institutional support.\n\nThe work concluded with the creation of an amphitheater on the west side and in the foundations, coupled with the existing building by using hydraulic jacks.\n\nIn total, 20,200 upgraded seats were installed, with each seat having a tilt of 87 degrees, ensuring a perfect view and proximity to the pitch. In addition, to access the new ring, four entrance towers were erected on the outside, each with two staircases and a central spiral ramp.\n\nWith the new structure, the height of the stadium was increased from 22 m to 45 m. This caused problems during the winter, leaving two-thirds of the field of play in the shade. This lack of sunlight led to grass deterioration on the pitch. For this reason, a polypropylene pipe network was installed at a 20 cm depth under the pitch. At over 30 km long the pipe system circulates hot water, keeping the turf from freezing in cold temperatures.\n\nAlso, due to the height of the stand, it was necessary to improve and increase the lighting capability. A retractable protective roof was also installed to protect the fans from the elements. After the renovation, the stadium's capacity was 110,000 spectators.\n\nAlready in the summer of 1998, and chaired by Lorenzo Sanz, the Santiago Bernabéu adopted an all-seating arrangement, bringing its capacity down to 75,328 spectators.\n\nAs the club kept growing in all regards, thoughts for further changes to the stadium appeared. When Florentino Pérez became the president of the club, he launched a \"master plan\" with one goal: to improve the comfort of the Santiago Bernabéu and the quality of its facilities, and maximise revenue for the stadium.\n\nPérez invested €127 million in five years (2001–2006) by adding an expansion to the east side of the stadium, as well adding a new façade on Father Damien street, new costumes, new boxes and VIP areas, a new stage in honour of the east side, a new press area (also located on the east side), a new audio system, new bars, integration of heating in the stands, panoramic lifts, new restaurants, escalators in the tower access, and implementation of the multipurpose building in Father Damien street. Following the enlargement of the lateral east side and the creation of new galleries, the capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu was 80,354, all seated.\n\nIn 2007, the 1,000th match was played at the Santiago Bernabéu. In addition, the latest revision of UEFA on 27, on the occasion of Champions League match against Olympiacos, served as a final step to give the Santiago Bernabéu elite stadium status on 14 November 2007, a month before the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the inauguration of the stadium. UEFA announced that the club will officially rename the elite stadium.\n\nPérez proposed construction of a retractable roof before he resigned in 2005. In 2009, following the re-election of Pérez as the club president, it was announced that the roof construction was looking unlikely due to the financial situation of the club. According to Spanish sports newspaper \"Marca\", however, Pérez wants to restructure Santiago Bernabéu. According to the newspaper, the architect in charge will be chosen from among a shortlist of Spanish architects Santiago Calatrava and Pritzker Prize-winner Rafael Moneo, and Chinese-American Ieoh Ming Pei, also a Pritzker winner.\n\nAccording to the official website of the club, the current capacity is 81,044.\n\nOn 16 October 2013, Pérez announced that Real Madrid was seeking to sell the naming rights for its stadium and looking for a sponsor for the €400 million renovation project. The proposed design of the stadium renovation, produced by German architects GMP, was unveiled on 31 January 2014. The bold design includes a retractable roof, with the overall cost of around €400 million likely to be met half via the sale of naming rights and half via a bond issue to Real members according to Spanish media reports. Pérez said, \"We want to make the Santiago Bernabéu the best stadium in the world.\" Real Madrid then announced a sponsorship agreement with IPIC to assist the club in the redevelopment of the stadium. Pérez then said that in compliance to the agreement the name of the stadium would be renamed \"IPIC Bernabeu\" or \"CEPSA Bernabeu\". The surface has been replaced with Mixto hybrid grass.\n\nReal Madrid and Microsoft launched the first interactive audioguide for the Bernabéu Tour on 3 April 2017. Over 200,000 people toured the stadium in 2016, of which over 60% were foreigners.\n\nThe €400 million project is set to begin in summer 2017. The capacity will not be increased and will remain at 81,000 seats. It is still unknown what will be the name of the stadium, as it will change due to the sponsorship agreement. The stadium will grow ten metres in height and the roof will be added.\n\nThe work is expected to last three years and the stadium is aimed to be finished at the beginning of the 2020–21 season.\n\nIn order for the project not to get in the way of playing matches, the team will use Roman techniques with raising the top, which will make it easier for the works to continue while the season is underway and there are matches once or twice a week. \"The project is complex because it will not stop the football and therefore complicates the works and design, which has a roof that encloses the whole stadium. They are going to lift the roof like the Romans did, but with modern technology. They will raise the inner ring by string-pulling with hydraulic jacks, bridge technology and ski lifts in a short period of time in the summer to respect the sporting calendar,\" said Tristán López Chicheri, the individual in charge of renovation.\n\nChicheri believes the renovation will bring tourists to the stadium all year round, with many attractions planned. The stadium is supposed to have more restaurants, a shopping centre and a hotel, with some rooms having a view of the pitch. \"It is not only on matchdays that it will be used – there are venues like the Bernabéu that are in the middle of the city and it is a shame that they have no life beyond 35–40 matches a year,\" noted Chicheri.\n\nThe areas around the Bernabéu will be rearranged: the Plaza de los Sagrados Corazones will be removed to be replaced by 6,000 square metres of gardens.\nIn mid-August 2017, the new supporters' area at Santiago Bernabéu is expected to be ready.\n\nThe stadium is located in the district of Chamartín of Madrid. It occupies the block bounded by the Paseo de la Castellana and the streets of Concha Espina, Padre Damián, and Rafael Salgado. Nearest subway station is Santiago Bernabéu on the Line 10.\n\nThe stadium is served by its own metro station along the Line 10 called \"Santiago Bernabéu\". It is also served by bus routes 14, 27, 40, 43, 120, 147 and 150. The stadium is away from Barajas International Airport.\n\nSantiago Bernabéu hosted three matches of the 1964 European Nations' Cup, a tournament which Spain hosted: one qualifying match and two in the main tournament, including the final. All of the matches involved Spain.\n\nThe stadium hosted one qualifying round match against Romania, which resulted in a 6–0 win.\n\nThe stadium hosted two matches of the tournament, including the final.\nThe match was contested by the 1960 winners, the Soviet Union, and the hosts, Spain, at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. Spain won the match 2–1, with goals coming from Jesús María Pereda and Marcelino. Galimzyan Khusainov scored for the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the 1982 World Cup held in Spain, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium hosted four matches: three in the second round (West Germany–England, West Germany–Spain and Spain–England) as well as the final between West Germany and Italy.\n\nThe stadium hosted three second round matches.\n\nThe 1982 FIFA World Cup Final was a football match contested between Italy and West Germany. It was played on 11 July 1982.\nAfter a scoreless first half during which Antonio Cabrini fired a penalty low and wide to the right of goal, Paolo Rossi scored first, heading home a bouncing Claudio Gentile cross from the right from close range. Marco Tardelli then scored from the edge of the area with a low left footed shot before Alessandro Altobelli, at the end of a counterattack by winger Bruno Conti, made it 3–0 with another low left footed shot.\nItaly's lead appeared secure, encouraging Italian president Sandro Pertini to wag his finger at the cameras in a playful 'not going to catch us now' gesture from the stands. Paul Breitner scored for Germany in the 83rd minute, firing low past the goalkeeper from the right, but Italy held on to claim their first World Cup title in 44 years, and their third in total with a 3–1 victory.\n\n1957 European Cup Final\n\nThis match was contested between Real Madrid, champions of Spain, and Fiorentina, champions of Italy. In this season, 16 teams played for the trophy. Real Madrid won 2–0 in the final after goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Francisco Gento in the second half. This was the second consecutive European Cup for Real Madrid after having won his first trophy one year before, in the Parc des Princes against Stade de Reims.\n\n1969 European Cup Final\n\nThis year Milan, champions of Italy, played Ajax, champions of the Netherlands, to determine who would be the champions of Europe. Milan defeated Ajax 4–1 to win their second European championship. Ajax made history by being the first Dutch team to reach a final.\n\n1980 European Cup Final\n\nIn this final, defending champions Nottingham Forest of England faced Hamburger SV, champions of Germany. The match ended with a victory for the English team with a 1–0 result. The new champions of Europe retained the trophy and achieved a historic second consecutive European Cup.\n\n2010 UEFA Champions League Final\n\nA game played between two best teams in the Champions League which consists of group stage and knock-out stage. The Final is played at a different stadium each year. In 2010, Bayern Munich, who eliminated Lyon in the semi-finals, faced Internazionale, who defeated Barcelona in the semi-finals. Inter won 2–0 after two goals from Diego Milito.\n\n2018 Copa Libertadores Final\n\nThe 2018 CONMEBOL (South America federation) final between Buenos Aires, Argentina archrivals Boca Juniors and Club Atlético River Plate was a two-legged tie, with River Plate leading 2-2 on the away goals tiebreaker following the 11 November 2018 first leg held at Estadio Alberto J. Armando, at Boca Juniors' home pitch. \n\nDuring the planned second leg, scheduled for Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti, the home pitch of River Plate, on 24 November 2018, numerous River Plate spectators threw glass bottles and fired missiles at the Boca Juniors team bus headed to the stadium, injuring numerous players as a result. CONMEBOL postponed the match and moved the second leg to 9 December 2018 at Madrid for security and travel reasons. Because the 2018 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates is to be conducted three days after the rescheduled final, the decision was made to hold the final in Madrid, a neutral site, at the home pitch of UEFA nominee Real Madrid C.F., which would allow the winning club to fly to the UAE and arrive with sufficient time.\n\n"}

It lets athletes compete in bad weather without serious performance loss and improves their results over other surfaces. It also provides a more consistent surface for competition even under optimum weather. Such tracks have become the standard for most elite competitions. \n\nBecause the \"Tartan\" brand name was the first and was widely successful in its time, the name Tartan has been incorrectly used as a genericized trademark for description of an all-weather running track.\n\n3M's first generation artificial turf of the late 1960s and early 1970s was branded as \"Tartan Turf.\"\n\nThe 1968 Summer Olympics at Mexico City was the first Olympic Games to use the Tartan track surface in athletics. Olympic shot put champion Bill Nieder was instrumental in developing the product and selling it for use in the Olympics. \n\nAmerican track and field coach Bert Bonanno, who had been recruited by the Mexican Olympic Committee to help prepare their athletes, worked as a liaison between the Mexican officials and manufacturer 3M in 1968. “It had been red cinder at the Olympic Games up until then. 3M hired Jesse Owens to assist them to convince the Mexican Olympic Committee to put that track in,” Bonanno said.\n\nA Tartan track was constructed for the men's U.S. Olympic Trials at Echo Summit, California, west of South Lake Tahoe. Just off U.S. Route 50, it was built in the summer of 1968 in the parking lot of Nebelhorn ski area, at an elevation of .\n\nThe original trade name \"Tartan\" came from 3M, manufacturers of Scotch Tape and continuing the Scotch name tradition. Those original tracks required mercury as a catalyst, later found to be an environmental hazard. An independent company has perfected the process without mercury. There are now numerous competitors in the \"all-weather track\" industry. In fact, the \"Tartan\" tracks of the late 1960s were the second generation of all-weather track surfacing. Before that, there were several tracks constructed of rubber (usually tire shavings) and asphalt. The first recorded use of a Tartan Track surface in competition in England was a long jump at the Norman Green Sports Centre in Solihull, September 16, 1967, though there were earlier uses in the United States.\n\n\n"}
