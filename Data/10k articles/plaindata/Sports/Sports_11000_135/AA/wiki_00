The stadium is the home field of the FBS independent New Mexico State Aggies. The venue opened in September 1978 and the current seating capacity is 30,343. The artificial playing field sits at an elevation of 3,980 feet (1,213 m) above sea level. It is the former home of NM State Aggies women's soccer.\n\nPrior to 1978, the Aggies had played on the same site since 1933. Located just to the northeast of Hadley Hall (the university's Administration building), and originally known as Quesenberry Field, the original Memorial Stadium was built over it in 1950. It was dedicated as a memorial to New Mexico A&M students who had died in World War II, World War I, and the Spanish–American War, among whom was Henry C. Gilbert Jr., whose parents were instrumental in the 10-year-long fundraising drive. Memorial Stadium, which served for 28 seasons, was replaced both due to its small size (at maximum, the seating capacity was only 12,155) and the want of an expanded athletics plant with more infrastructure and parking. (Currently Memorial Tower, which was originally part of the press box of the stadium, is the only remaining reminder of the stadium. It is now structurally incorporated into the university's Health and Social Services building and houses a memorial lounge and computer lab.)\n\nThe \"new\" Aggie Memorial Stadium, dedicated to alumni who had served in the Korean War and Vietnam War, was built for $4 million over a period of 18 months. It was funded by the state legislature as part of a capital project on the campus. The first home game saw the Aggies defeat rival UTEP 35–32 on September 16, 1978. 20 years (and 10 days) later, the Aggies and Miners played to the largest crowd in stadium history, with 32,993 in attendance to see the Aggies win again, 33–24.\n\nThe stadium, designed by alumnus Craig Protz of Bohering-Protz Associates, was built just to the south of the Pan American Center, the home of Aggie basketball. The stadium boasts a unique design in which earth that was excavated to construct the lower bowl and field level was moved to the sides of the stadium to support the upper level, with a street level concourse dividing the lower and upper bowls. The first level of seating wraps around the field, except for two wide gaps behind each end zone. The southern end is a grass berm, with the Fulton Athletics Center, a $6 million structure constructed in 2004 housing athletics offices, an athletic training and education center, and club facilities, behind it. The northern end leads to the locker room facilities and main entrance to the stadium. Because of these gaps it was previously impossible to access the east side of the stadium from the west, and vice versa, without exiting the stadium and re-entering on the other side. A bridge over the north ramp constructed prior to the 2006 season now allows fans to cross from one side of the stadium to the other. The seating extends to a rounded second level on either side of the field, which extends the length of the playing field. The curved, undulating design of the upper level is reminiscent of similarly designed structures such as Memphis' Liberty Bowl Stadium and the now-demolished Tampa Stadium, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale.\n\nThe original four pole sodium vapor lighting system is now augmented by four additional smaller poles added prior to the 2005 season to increase the stadium's lighting capacity for televised night games. For the 2007 season, a new $1.5 million scoreboard including a 38'x23' video screen has been added to the facility, as well as a new team meeting and video room complex adjacent to the field house on the stadium's north end.\n\nIn addition to football, the stadium occasionally hosts major concerts and other large outdoor gatherings on campus.\n\nArtists that have performed at the stadium include Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Faith No More, The Eagles, Vans Warped Tour & Paul McCartney, among others.\n\nDuring the 2005–06 renovation of the nearby Pan American Center, the stadium hosted the university's commencement ceremonies, although they returned to the Pan Am following completion of the renovations. Also, Mayfield High School and Las Cruces High School play against each other in the stadium every year in November. (Varsity only). Starting in November 2017, Onate High School and Centennial High School will play each other in the stadium to start a new tradition.\n\n\n"}

For example, in October 2014 Belén Rodríguez and De Martino founded a chain of clothing stores in Milan named \"4store\". Following initial success, in mid-2015 this chain was expanded to the area around Milan but failed later that year.

In September 2016 Belén lost \"Vanitas\" line in favour to Madalina Ghenea.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, Belén posed for the first time naked for the \"Vuemme Calendar 2006\" (published in late 2005 for the year 2006) of which she was the only model.

The neighborhood-size development consists of a central, four-story domed City Chess Hall surrounded by an Olympic-style village of Californian-Mediterranean Revival Style architecture. The site has a conference center, public swimming pool and a museum of Kalmyk Buddhist art. The complex features sculptures and artwork devoted to chess, including a statue of Ostap Bender, a fictional character of popular books written by Ilya Ilf and Yevgeni Petrov, who proposed a creation of world chess capital. The complex has been used to host visiting dignitaries like the Dalai Lama.\n\nCompleted in 1998, the idea and development of Chess City is directly the result of Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, Kalmykia's millionaire President who has ruled the republic since 1993 and been president of FIDE, the international governing body of chess, since 1995. A fanatical chess enthusiast, Ilyumzhinov had the complex built in time for the 33rd Chess Olympiad.\n\nChess City has hosted three major FIDE tournaments: the XXXIII Chess Olympiad in 1998, the 2004 Women's World Chess Championship, and the 2006 World Chess Championship.\n\nFuture plans for Chess City include a water sport complex, skiing center, government buildings, business centers, opera and ballet theaters, museums, a conservatory, an art school, religious academies, a center of traditional medicine, and residences for any ambassadors who may be accredited to Kalmykia.\n\nKalmykia is a poor republic of approximately 300,000 people located in the barren steppe regions in the southeastern corner of Europe. Without much in terms of natural resources, the nation is economically depressed and many of its citizens live in poverty. As a result, the construction of the opulent Chess City was greatly criticized for spending large sums of money on a tourist resort. Chess tournament winners are sometimes rewarded with a diamond tiara. Additionally, the desert climate of the area puts many of the planned expansions for Chess City, like the water sports complex, under scrutiny.\n\n\n"}

It is the home stadium of Ballinamallard United. It was first used by Ballinamallard United in 1975, when the club was founded.\n\nSince 2006, Ferney Park has undergone a number of renovations. The ground did not meet the criteria for use in the IFA Championship, which was established in 2008, and Ballinamallard played its home matches at Holm Park, the home of Armagh City, during the 2008/09 season and the first part of 2009/10, while it was brought up to standard. Ballinamallard's first match back at the upgraded Ferney Park was on 5 December 2009. Floodlights were installed in 2010. In 2012, Ballinamallard United were promoted to the IFA Premiership after receiving a domestic licence to do so from the Irish Football Association. However at the time, Ferney Park did not meet the required standards. The club were in the process of building two new stands, funded by fans buying seats. The plans and designs of the new stands were printed on the cover of the matchday programme for United's last game before being promoted against Ards. The building of the stands could not be guaranteed to be completed before the start of the Irish Premiership season. As a result, the club were obliged to nominate Stangmore Park in Dungannon, County Tyrone as their home ground if construction could not be finished in time. At a cost of £80,000 from four fans, the pitch at Ferney Park was also re-laid in preparation. However, the work was finished in time for Ferney Park to be used to host Ballinamallard's opening game against Dungannon Swifts. The new stands were also officially opened for this match.\n\nIn December 2012, during half-time in a match between Ballinamallard United and Linfield, the Ferney Park pitch was invaded by twenty Linfield supporters who waved Union Flags from the centre of the pitch. This was done as part of the Belfast City Hall flag protests. Ballinamallard United had no prior warning that this would happen and the Police Service of Northern Ireland took no actions amid fears of inflaming the situation.\n\nFerney Park is home to Ballinamallard United and is also used to host their reserves' matches. It is also home to the Fermanagh Mallards women's football club. In 2012, Ferney Park was used to host the opening game of the Northern Ireland Milk Cup between Fermanagh and English side, Newcastle United. This was done to commemorate the Milk Cup's 30th anniversary by playing competition matches away from the normal locations along the north coast of Northern Ireland.\n\nFerney Park has received a reputation in Northern Irish football as being a difficult ground to find with members of the media covering games at the stadium often getting lost on their way to it. This sometimes led to television channels having to use Ballinamallard United's own coverage of matches to be broadcast on television. This was often attributed to television companies deeming it too expensive to regularly send cameras to Ballinamallard. This situation has been criticized by Ballinamallard residents who feel that television coverage of Ballinamallard United is not as detailed as other teams because of the location of Ferney Park.\n"}

The design allows the device to climb out of the water and be stable in the air. This was achieved by the underfoot propulsion and hand stabilization. The French Institut national de la propriété industrielle (INPI) granted Zapata a patent for his invention. The Flyboard was the subject of a lawsuit from competitor Jetlev which was dropped without prejudice in March 2013. The device was presented to the public for the first time at the jet ski World Championship 2012 in China. Since its introduction in 2012 the Flyboard has sold around 2500 units.\n\nIn the 2015 season of America's Got Talent, a flyboard enthusiast named Damone Rippy performed Flyboarding as his act on the show.\n\nThe Flyboard is a bolt-on device that is attached to a personal water craft (PWC). It is designed so that the PWC follows behind the rider’s trail, allowing the rider multiple degrees of freedom, even allowing the rider to go underwater if they desire. The pilot on the Flyboard is secured in by bindings similar to a wakeboard and the rider is propelled from water jets below the device. The Flyboard is buoyant for safety, which also allows the rider to rest in the water between rides. The use of a personal flotation device and helmet is required by rental locations for safety purposes to protect against serious head trauma in the event of the rider impacting the PWC or stationary structures, and to protect the ears from damage and discomfort from impacts with the water.\n\nDevice power is controlled by a throttle on the PWC. The equipment may be used in two modes: The primary one requires two people, one to control the PWC throttle which regulates the power and height of the rider. The secondary mode relies on an accessory called an Electronic Management Kit (EMK) which allows the rider to control the PWC throttle.\n\nThe first Flyboard World Championships took place in Doha, Qatar in October 2012.\n\nFor the first time, a Flyboard stunt was done in a Bollywood film by Hrithik Roshan in the film \"Bang Bang!\".\n\n"}

It was originally named the Municipal Auditorium, but was renamed in honor of former St. Louis Mayor Henry Kiel in 1943. A unique feature of the auditorium was that it was split into two; the front of the building was the Kiel Opera House. It was possible to use both sides at once as the stages were back to back. President Harry Truman gave a speech there in which both sides were opened to see his speech.\n\nThe Kiel Auditorium replaced the St. Louis Coliseum as the city's main indoor arena.\n\nIn 1955, the auditorium was also the venue for the second international conference of Alcoholics Anonymous, which established the service conference structure for the movement.\n\nKiel Auditorium played host to a variety of concerts and wrestling events, from the 1950s, until its closure in 1991.

{"id": "3411441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3411441", "title": "Odsal Stadium", "text": "Odsal Stadium\n\nOdsal Stadium, is a sports stadium in Odsal, Bradford, West Yorkshire. The stadium is currently home of Bradford Bulls Rugby League team as well as previously home to the speedway team Bradford Dukes, as well the football team Bradford City following the Valley Parade fire. Odsal has also been a venue for baseball, basketball, kabbadi, show jumping, tennis, live music and international Rugby League. It is also the largest rugby league stadium in England.\n\nThe stadium holds the British attendance records for a Rugby match, 102,569 in 1954 at the rugby league Warrington-Halifax Challenge Cup Final replay, and for a domestic, non-final Rugby League match, 69,429 at the third round Challenge Cup tie between Bradford Northern and Huddersfield in 1953. The highest recorded attendance of the Super League era being 24,020 against neighbouring rivals Leeds on 3 September 1999. While its capacity has reduced significantly, it remains the largest stadium in Super League The stadium is owned by the Bradford City Council, but due to financial problems the Rugby Football League purchased the lease on it in 2012.\n\nFormed in 1907, the Bradford Northern club had played at a number of venues including the Greenfield Athletic Ground in Dudley Hill and Bowling Old Lane Cricket Club's ground in Birch Lane. By the early 1920s, however, Birch Lane's limitations were clear and Northern began to seek another home. Precarious finances prevented the club being able to take up an offer to develop land off Rooley Lane or to upgrade and move back to Greenfield, but in 1933, Bradford City Council gave them the opportunity to transform land at Odsal Top into their home ground. On 20 June 1933 the club therefore signed a ten-year deal on the site, which was to become the biggest stadium in England outside Wembley.\n\nThe site was a former quarry which was then being used as a landfill tip. Ernest Call M.B.E., the Director of Cleansing for Bradford City Council devised a system of controlled tipping that saw 140,000 cart loads of household waste deposited to form the characteristic banking at Odsal. The club were to be responsible for boundary fencing, dressing rooms and seated accommodation.\n\nTo be able to turf the pitch, and other areas, a turf fund was put into place which raised a total of £900 to cover the work. A stand was erected at the cost of £2,000, which was paid for by the Rugby Football League. It held 1,500 on a mixture of benches and tip-up seats.\n\nThe ground was officially opened by Sir Joseph Taylor, President of Huddersfield on 1 September 1934. His club went on to beat the hosts 31–16, Australian winger Ray Markham scoring four tries in front of an estimated 20,000. The clubhouse and dressing rooms were officially opened before a match against Hull F.C. on 2 February 1935. Contemporary pictures show that as late as August 1935 the banking on the Rooley Avenue side was still being created.\n\nIn 1945, speedway began in Bradford with the Odsal Boomerangs. In the post-Second World War years, speedway proved extremely popular with crowds of over 20,000 regularly attending meetings at Odsal, with the 1946 average for the first year of the National League after the war. The highest speedway attendance during this period came on 5 July 1947 when 47,050 fans saw England defeat Australia 65-43 in a Test match. This remains the largest-ever speedway crowd for Odsal Stadium.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the lower floor of the clubhouse was also used as an Air Raid Precautions centre, and one of the dressing rooms was the map room. On 20 December 1947, the largest ever attendance for an international test at Odsal was set when 42,685 saw England defeat New Zealand 25–9. The first floodlit rugby match in the North of England was held at Odsal in 1951. In September 1951, Council Engineer Ernest Wardley drew up a plan for a 92,000 capacity 'European' style stadium, at a cost of £250,000. Eventually £50,000 was spent on terracing the Rooley Avenue end in 1964, before the Wardley plan was officially dropped the following year.\n\nAfter a disastrous 1960 season, the Panthers (previously the Odsal Boomerangs) left Odsal and in 1961 moved across town to the Greenfield Stadium, better known for greyhound racing. After the Panthers folded in 1962, Motorcycle Speedway would not return to Bradford for another 10 years.\n\nSpeedway returned to Odsal when promoters Les Whaley, Mike Parker and Bill Bridgett moved the British League Division Two side Nelson Admirals across the Pennines for the final eleven league meetings of the 1970 season and went on to adopt Bradford Northern as their name and red, black and amber as their colours. Northern would finish second in Division 2 in 1971, but from there results and attendances steadily declined and the team folded after 1973.\n\nThe second test of the 1978 Ashes series was played at Odsal, with Great Britain defeating Australia before a crowd of 26,761. The Lions team that day featured what was called a \"Dad's Army\" front row with Jim Mills, Tony Fisher and Brian Lockwood all being over the age of 30.\n\nThe ground's clubhouse had to be refurbished when it was condemned in the mid-1980s. The social facilities were also upgraded at the same time.\n\nSpeedway returned to Odsal in 1985 after a ten-year absence when it was selected by the FIM to host the 1985 World Final.\n\nFollowing the Valley Parade fire disaster of 1985, Bradford City played a handful of games at Leeds Road and Elland Road whilst the future of Valley Parade was decided. On 23 September 1985, a Football League delegation visited Odsal to view the stadium to pass it fit to host City's home games. Segregation fences were erected on the old Main Stand side and 1,000 uncovered seats were bolted onto the terracing – it was planned to install 7,000 in the future. Meanwhile, a further £1 million was spent to conform with new safety standards – bringing the total spent on Odsal to £3.5 million. New boundary walls, turnstiles, exit gates, a bus layby in Rooley Avenue and access road were added. Odsal played host to Bradford City's Division Two home games until December 1986. Odsal Stadium also held a modern-day attendance record for almost six years.\n\nLike most British stadia, Odsal had its capacity substantially reduced by the safety measures introduced in the 1990s following the Hillsborough disaster and the findings of the Taylor Report.\n\nAt the dawn of the Super League era in 1996, Bradford Bulls wanted to attract new sponsors but had poor and outdated hospitality suites. In 2000 they announced plans to build hospitality suites at the South End of the stadium which would mean building on the track around the pitch, effectively ending Speedways association with Bradford. Construction started in 2001 and was completed in 2002 with Bradford Bulls playing two seasons at Valley Parade.\n\nAfter London won the right to host the 2012 Olympic Games in 2008, plans were put in place for an Olympic Legacy Park at Odsal, which would mean redeveloping the stadium and the Richard Dunn Leisure Centre opposite. Although these plans never came to fruition and a Legacy Park was built in Sheffield instead.\n\nIn 2012, the Bulls got into financial difficulties and the RFL stepped in and bought the lease to Odsal. In early 2017 the Bulls were liquidated and a new club was formed by Andrew Chalmers who wants to redevelop Odsal into a venue fit for Super League and international rugby league.\n\nIn 2018 it was revealed Bradford Park Avenue were in discussions about moving to Odsal.\n\nThe rugby pitch at Odsal Stadium is surrounded by a speedway track which was used mostly for Motorcycle speedway, though the stadium also hosted stock car racing.\n\nAfter finishing at the bottom of the National League in 1948 and 1949, the Boomerangs folded and were replaced in 1950 by the Odsal Tudors. Despite the name change, fortunes remained the same with the Tudors finishing on the bottom of the NL ladder in 1951. In 1959 the Tudors dropped the Odsal name and were renamed the Bradford Tudors. The most famous of the Tudors riders was English star Nigel Boocock who rode for the team from 1955-1957.\n\nIn 1960, the Bradford Tudors renamed themselves the Bradford Panthers. After a disastrous 1960 season, the Panthers left Odsal and in 1961 moved across town to the Greenfield Stadium, better known for greyhound racing. After the Panthers folded in 1962, Motorcycle Speedway would not return to Bradford for another 10 years.\n\nThe sound of speedway bikes was heard once again at Odsal when promoters Les Whaley, Mike Parker and Bill Bridgett moved the British League Division Two side Nelson Admirals across the Pennines for the final eleven league meetings of the 1970 season. The Admirals became Bradford Northern like their rugby league landlords and even adopted their red, black and amber colours, though the move was met with opposition from the nearby Halifax Dukes. Northern would finish second in Div.II in 1971, but from there results and attendances steadily declined and again, a Bradford speedway team folded after 1973.\n\nSpeedway wasn't lost to Bradford, or Odsal though as from the Bradford Barons were formed, but they were also short lived and only lasted the years 1974 and 1975. Speedway would once again not return to Bradford for another 10 years.\n\nSpeedway returned to Odsal in 1985 after a ten-year absence when it was selected by the FIM to host the 1985 World Final, the first time the Final in England would not be held at Wembley Stadium. In the three years after the 1981 World Final at Wembley, international speedway's home in Great Britain had been the White City Stadium in London. However, with the closure of White City in 1985 a new home would be needed and the 30,000 capacity Odsal was chosen. A capacity crowd at the 1985 World Final saw a titanic fight between Denmark's defending World Champion Erik Gundersen, his fellow countryman Hans Nielsen, and American rider Sam Ermolenko. The trio all finished the meeting on 13 points each which saw a three-way runoff for the top 3 placings with Gundersen winning from Nielsen and Ermolenko. Just a month prior to the World Final, Odsal also hosted the Overseas Final as part of the World Final qualifications. That meeting saw two riders finish at the top on 14 points, American Shawn Moran and English favourite, Halifax Dukes rider Kenny Carter. Moran would defeat Carter in the runoff for the Overseas title.\n\nIn March 1986, Odsal opened its doors to British League action for the first time since the 1950s after the Halifax Dukes were offered a new home track. The new 'Bradford Dukes' team would in later years include World Champions Gary Havelock and Mark Loram, multiple British and Long Track World Champions Simon Wigg and Kelvin Tatum, and dual Australian Champion Glenn Doyle. However, the club suffered the tragic loss of Kenny Carter who died in murder/suicide after shooting his wife and then himself at their home in May 1986.\n\nOdsal Stadium hosted its second World Final in 1990. Swedish rider Per Jonsson won his only World Championship when he defeated Shawn Moran in a runoff after both had finished the meeting on 13 points. Moran was later stripped of his silver medal by the FIM after he had tested positive to a drug test taken three months earlier at the Overseas Final in Coventry. Moran claimed that the drug he took was a pain killer prescribed by a doctor in Sweden, but the FIM stood firm. They also did not upgrade the standings and the official records show no second place rider. Young Australian rider Todd Wiltshire riding in his first World Final surprised many by finishing in third place with 12 points.\n\nFrom 1987, Bradford speedway then enjoyed its greatest period of success, winning eight trophies until the club's closure in 1997 when despite winning the Elite League, the club folded for the third time.\n\nOdsal Stadium hosted the 1997 Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain. Danish rider Brian Andersen won the Grand Prix from America's reigning World Champion Billy Hamill, with Swede Jimmy Nilsen finishing third in the Final. Bradford Dukes rider Mark Loram finished 4th in the Final. Loram would later go on to be the 2000 World Champion after winning the Speedway Grand Prix series that year.\n\n\n\n\nCapacity- 7,290 (standing)\nThe Rooley Avenue End is situated at the Northern end of the stadium. It is open terracing and is where the big screen is erected for televised games. The stand has turnstiles that back onto Rooley Avenue.\n\nCapacity- 4,890 (seating)\nThe East Stand is the only part of the ground that is covered and has seating. The stand runs parallel to the pith and has \"BULLS\" spelt out on the seats. The stand houses hone supporters and most season ticket holders as well as the press and some executive seats. There is also bars and toilets at the top of the stand.\n\nCapacity- 620 (seating)\nThe South Bank is the stadiums hospitality stand which sits at the Southern end of the ground. It has two levels each containing a banquiting suite and seats looking out onto the pitch. Speedway ended its association with Odsal after the hospitality building was built on turns 3 and 4.\n\nCapacity- 9,309 (standing)\nThe West Stand is uncovered terracing and houses the players changing rooms and tunnel as well as TV gantry at the top of the stand. The supporters bar is located in the north-west corner of the stand and also houses a manual scoreboard and clock. At the top of the stand, on ground level with Rooley Avenue is the car park and club shop and ticket office. There are a few hospitality boxes at the top of the stand bit these are not used after the construction of the South Bank.\n\nThe pitch at Odsal has a distinctive concave contour, with the corners of the pitch behind the try-line noticeably sloping up towards the stands. This was due to the stadium being used to host speedway events and so the corners of the pitch were removable to allow full use of the track. With the end of speedway at Odsal, the upturned corners are no longer as pronounced as they once were.\n\nAs there has been little investment in the stadium, apart from the South Bank being built in 2002, most of the stadium is run down. In the run up to the 2012 London Olympics, Bradford City Council applied for an Olympic Legacy Park to be built at Odsal and the site of Richards Dunn Sport Centre. Bradford's bid was turned down in favour of Sheffield, which means it is highly unlikely and improvements will be made to Odsal in the near future. However when Andrew Chalmers bought the club in 2017, he expressed an interest in redeveloping the stadium for it to be fit for Super League and future international test matches.\n\nList of rugby league test matches played at Odsal Stadium.\nOdsal Stadium also saw Bradford Northern and the county side Yorkshire play host to international touring teams from Australia and New Zealand from 1937–1994.\n\nOdsal record\nSuper League record\nTest match record\nWorld Cup record\nSpeedway Record\n\n\n"}

Its first major event was the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students. It is the largest stadium in the world, with a total capacity of approximately 114,000. The site occupies an area of . It is commonly confused with the nearby 50,000 capacity Kim Il-sung Stadium due to proximity, but possesses unique size and seating capacities which provide distinction.\n\nIts name comes from Rungra Island in the Taedong River, upon which it is situated, and from the International Workers' Day celebrated on May Day every year.\n\nIt is currently used for football matches, a few athletics events, but most often for the mass games of the Arirang Festival. Officially, the stadium can seat 150,000 people, but the real capacity is under 114,000. Even the lower actual capacity ranks first on the list of largest stadiums by capacity in the world.\n\nIts scalloped roof features 16 arches arranged in a ring, and resembles a magnolia blossom.\n\nIt hosts events on a main pitch sprawling across over 22,500 m² (242,200 ft²). Its total floor space is over 207,000 m² (2.2 million ft²) across eight stories, and the lobes of its roof peak at more than 60 m (197 ft) from the ground.\n\nAfter the 1988 Summer Olympics had been awarded to Seoul, North Korea doubled down its efforts to present itself as the legitimate Korean state. As part of these efforts, it successfully bid to organize the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students in Pyongyang in 1989. Massive construction projects were initiated in preparation for the festival, one of which was the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium. At the time of completion, it was the largest stadium ever built in Asia.\n\nWhile the stadium is used for sporting events, it is most famous as the site of massive performances and shows celebrating Kim Il-sung and the North Korean nation. In June–July 2002 it was the site of a large choreographed \"Arirang Festival\" gymnastic and artistic performance. The extravaganza involved for the first time some 100,000+ participants—double the number of spectators, and was open to foreigners. These performances are now an annual feature in Pyongyang, usually in August and September. The event in 2007 was recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the largest gymnastic display with 100,090 participants.\n\nIn the late 1990s, a number of North Korean army generals implicated in an assassination attempt on Kim Jong-il were executed via burning in the stadium.\n\nIn 2000 Kim Jong-il entertained Madeleine Albright, the United States Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton. \"Collision in Korea\" was the largest professional wrestling pay-per-view event ever that was jointly produced by World Championship Wrestling and New Japan Pro-Wrestling. It took place over a period of two days on April 28 and 29, 1995 at the stadium and had an attendance of 150,000 and 190,000 according to local authorities. It did not air in North America until August 4, 1995. American wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer has claimed that the actual combined attendance for the two-day-event was somewhere around 160,000 total.\n\nAfter a two-year renovation project, the stadium reopened in 2015.\n\nIn July 2017, the Rungnado Stadium played host to six group stage matches as part of 2018 AFC U-23 Championship qualification.\n\nIn the September 2018 inter-Korean summit in Pyeongyang, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea gave a speech with Chairman Kim Jong-un to 150,000 North Korean spectators. The speech has themes of unification, peace, and cooperation. \n\n\n\n"}

Pigott Memorial Stadium) is a historic site in Fort Myers, Florida, United States. The park is named after the family that donated the land in the 1920s. For years the stadium has hosted Major League Baseball spring training as well as a dozen years of Florida State League baseball. The stadium has hosted the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals spring training needs throughout the years. Terry Park was also home to some early minor league baseball most notable being the Fort Myers Palms and Fort Myers Royals, both belonging to the Florida State League. Hall of Famers Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Roberto Clemente, Jimmy Foxx, Bob Feller, Tris Speaker and George Brett are some of the notable players that have played at Terry Park Field.\n\nIn the Terry Family, a local Fort Myers family, donated approximately of cow pasture to Lee County. Amidst nothing but bulls and heifers, a small wooden grandstand, seating no more than 600 fans, was erected on the site about a mile east of downtown Fort Myers. The stadium was built as a spring training ballpark for Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics in . The park was the spring training home of the Philadelphia Athletics from 1925 until and the Cleveland Indians from until . It was also the home of the minor league Fort Myers Palms that operated there in 1926. The stadium remained in its 1925 condition, until 1943 when it was destroyed in a fire. However, in 1955 the park was rebuilt. This time, instead of wood, the stadium was made from steel and concrete.\n\nThe rebuilt Terry Park created an alliance between Fort Myers and the Pittsburgh Pirates. For years the Pirates wandered all over the country for a spring training location and were looking for a permanent spring training home. During a 12-year period the Pirates spent spring training in 7 different locations: McCulloch Park in Muncie, Indiana; Flamingo Park in Miami Beach, Gilmore Field in Hollywood, California; Perris Hill Park in San Bernardino; Gran Stadium in Havana, Cuba; and Jaycee Park in Fort Pierce, Florida. Terry Park became their spring training home for the next 14 years, before moving to Bradenton's McKechnie Field in .\n\nIn 1968 the Kansas City Athletics moved from Kansas City, Missouri to Oakland, California. This allowed for Kansas City to receive a Major League expansion team. They received their team which was called the Kansas City Royals. Terry Field became the new spring training home for the team. The team's historic first exhibition game was played at Terry Field. The Royals would remain in Fort Myers until . During the Kansas City Royals years, the field featured artificial turf, similar to that of Royals Stadium. However several years after the Royals left for Baseball City, the turf left as well.\n\nIn the Royals left Fort Myers for Haines City, Florida. The City open offered the team a new stadium and opened up a theme park called Boardwalk and Baseball that was centered on a baseball theme. \nThe main attraction was going to be the Kansas City Royals spring training home. However the deal later proved to be a bust and by 2002 the park was abandoned and later demolished.\n\nIn the Kansas City Royals brought a minor league affiliate to Fort Myers, the team was called the Fort Myers Royals and they were a Single A Florida State League franchise. The team played at Terry Field from 1978 until 1987. In 1985 the Royals won the Florida League Championship. Kevin Seitzer and Bret Saberhagen were members of the Fort Myers team and began their professional careers at Terry Park.\n\nAfter the Royals left Fort Myers, a new spring training team was never fielded at the stadium. Two new stadiums were built in Fort Myers, Hammond Stadium was built for the Minnesota Twins and City of Palms Park was built for the Boston Red Sox. The last professional baseball team to call Terry Park home was the Fort Myers Sun Sox of the short lived Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1989 and 1990. The league featured former MLB stars and was played during the winter months. The league folded in 1990. All SPBA playoff games were held at Terry Park, since the league's playoffs occurred during spring training.\n\nThe park pretty much still remained in its 1955 condition. On May 11, 1995 the ball field was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior. The memorial stadium was dedicated to area resident, Park T. Pigott (1914–1972), in recognition of his lifetime of service, through sports, to the youth of this community. For the 2003 season Terry Park was used by the Golden Eagles of Florida Gulf Coast University while their new ballpark is being built at their Fort Myers campus.\n\nIn 2004, the stadium was hit by Hurricane Charley. The damage from the storm caused the grandstand to be labeled \"unsafe\". \nLater in the year, The Board of Lee County Commissioners approved a guaranteed maximum price of $701,697 for Compass Construction to tear down the old grandstand and build a new one. But instead of rebuilding the historic 5,000 seat grandstand, the city replaced it with a small 700 seat structure. This was despite the fact that the park was given an official historic marker in 1995. Technically once a grandstand is demolished, the basepark loses all of its historic significance, regardless of whether it is the same field. Only the old girders have been retained as the outline for a new grandstand that opened in 2005. So what stands at Terry Park now bears little resemblance to the Spring training location it once was. While the new grandstand is covered, it is much smaller and made of metal. Many residents feel that it was unfortunate that the county decided not to try to save the classic grandstand. 2006 marked the centennial anniversary of Terry Park – at least the playing field portion of it. The new stadium currently seats about 900 people, as the additional bleachers down the foul lines have been removed. A spring training museum is also being considered for the park.\n\nToday, over 160 college baseball teams from around the country use Terry Park in the month of March to begin their college season. The park is currently part of a multi-diamond facility serving various amateur levels of baseball. The facility now sees year-round amateur baseball use. This property is part of the Lee County Multiple Property Submission, a Multiple Property Submission to the National Register. Terry Park is used year-round for baseball leagues, tournaments and special events. The facility has four lighted fields with spectator seating including a covered grandstand on the main field. The park is also equipped with batting cages near each field. Terry Park is currently being remodeled with new restrooms, concession area, press box and seating areas. The work will be done in phases to allow the park to operate as close to normal as possible.\n\n"}

Opened in 1901, it lasted for over a half century and was torn down in 1956. Its primary tenant was the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League. During a stretch when the club was tagged as the \"Lucky Beavers\", the ballpark was also sometimes called Lucky Beavers Stadium.\n\nThe site, in the Slabtown area, is presently an industrial property with no traces of the stadium, except for a plaque.\n\nBuilt in 1901, it was financed by E. I. Fuller and C. F. Swigert, two owners of trolley lines that ran nearby. The ballpark was on a block bounded by Northwest Vaughn Street on the south (third base), Northwest 24th Avenue on the east (first base), and Northwest 25th Avenue on the west (left to center field). The field had an unorthodox northwest alignment (home plate near the southeast corner), at an approximate elevation of above sea level.\n\nThe two financiers hoped to profit from professional baseball, both at the box office and via fares from their trolley lines. In 1896, Portland's former professional baseball team had folded; a new team, the Portland Webfoots, debuted in 1901. This team would go on to win the Pacific Northwest League title that year. The following year, the league merged with the California League to become the Pacific Coast League; the Webfooters, after several name change, settled on the name Portland Beavers.\n\nInitially, the stadium had a single 3,000-seat grandstand behind home plate; seating was expanded to 6,000 seats in 1905. That year, Portland hosted the Lewis & Clark Centennial Exposition, and the stadium was used for the National Track and Field championships, held concurrently. During that event, baseball was temporarily played on the grounds of the Portland Athletic Club (later the Multnomah Athletic Club), on a field that is now the site of Providence Park. With the construction of additional seating in 1912, Vaughn Street Park's capacity grew to 12,000 spectators.\n\nIn 1926, the stadium received its first serious local competition when the larger and more modern Multnomah Stadium (now Providence Park) opened approximately to the south. It was expected that the baseball team, now christened the Beavers, would move to the newer stadium, but the team elected to stay at Vaughn Street. Multnomah Stadium was instead used for other sporting events, including college football and greyhound racing.\n\nVaughn Street Park occasionally hosted other events besides baseball; several prizefights were held there.\n\nAmong the notable players to play at Vaughn Street, either for the home team or for the visitors, are Satchel Paige, Joe Tinker, Jim Thorpe, and Ted Williams.\n\nThe stadium also became, however briefly, the home of the Portland Rosebuds, a team owned by Olympic gold medalist The Rosebuds were part of the West Coast Baseball Association, an all-black league headed by Abe Saperstein, the owner of the Harlem Globetrotters; the league was disbanded after only two months.\n\nIn 1947, the center field bleachers burned in an early morning fire on September 21, blamed on a smoldering the stadium had recently been condemned by fire The center field bleachers were rebuilt, smaller than their predecessor and disconnected from the left field bleachers.\n\nIn 1955, the stadium was bought by new owners, who later announced that they would tear it down; the Beavers moved to Multnomah Stadium in 1956. The stadium was razed that same year. The grass field from Vaughn Street was transplanted to Multnomah Stadium; thirteen years later in 1969, artificial turf was installed.\n\nThe dimensions were hitter-friendly:\n\nSpecific references:\n\nGeneral references:\n\n"}

{"id": "48470830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48470830", "title": "Wills Gymnasium", "text": "Wills Gymnasium\n\nWills Gymnasium, often referred to as Wills Gym, was a multi-purpose athletic facility on the campus of Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, United States. Construction started in 1924 and the building was dedicated in 1925. It was the first dedicated gymnasium on the KSU campus, which had opened in 1913. Before the opening of Wills Gym, physical education classes and the intercollegiate and intramural sports teams used a variety of spaces for games and classes, both on campus in other buildings and off campus. The main gym seated approximately 4,000 people and the basement level included an indoor pool, locker rooms, and bowling alley. At the time, its capacity made it one of the largest facilities in the region. The building served as the primary home of the university's athletic teams and physical education department until 1950, when the Men's Physical Education Building opened. Wills Gym was the first permanent home of the Kent State Golden Flashes men's basketball team, and was also the original home venue for wrestling, men's swimming, men's and women's gymnastics, women's volleyball, and women's basketball.\n\nEven after being replaced as the primary athletic venue and physical education facility, Wills Gym continued to be used as the home venue for men's gymnastics, later joined by women's gymnastics in 1959, and women's volleyball and basketball in 1975. It was also used for women's physical education, intramural sports, class registration, and other activities for nearly 30 years. By the 1970s, structural and maintenance issues along with the passage and implementation of Title IX resulted in plans to build a replacement for Wills. Women's basketball and volleyball left Wills after their respective 1977 seasons and moved to Memorial Gym, while both gymnastics teams played part of their home schedules at Wills until 1979. The building was condemned by the state of Ohio in the mid 1970s. Physical education classes and offices were moved to the new Memorial Gym Annex, completed in mid-1979. In August 1979, the gymnasium and pool were razed, though the portion of the building which had housed the physical education offices remained as Wills Hall and housed the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program from 1983–2000. A parking lot was built on the site of the gym and pool. In the early 2000s, Wills Hall was torn down and replaced with a lobby area as part of the renovation of the adjacent University Auditorium, which was renamed Cartwright Hall in 2006.\n\nA gymnasium was part of the original plans for the Kent State Normal School and plans were presented to the Ohio State Legislature in 1916 for its construction along with a heating plant and additional dormitory. The allocation of funds for the gym, however, was not approved until 1923 due to World War I. In the meantime, physical education, intramural, and intercollegiate sports used a variety of other spaces. Early basketball games were held in various locations, such as the atrium of the original Administration Building (known as Cartwright Hall since 2006), in the basement of the original heating plant, in the local Congregational Church gymnasium, and at Theodore Roosevelt High School.\n\nThe site chosen for the gym was a swampy area known as Blackbird Lake, located directly behind the original Administration Building, which had been completed in 1914. Construction started on Wills Gym in 1924 and it was dedicated May 16, 1925. Initially, it was simply called \"the Gymnasium\" before being named for David C. Wills, who was chairman of the Kent State Board of Trustees at the time. Built as an annex to the Administration Building, the facility featured the main gymnasium, which had a balcony with seating for 650 people and an overall capacity of approximately 4,000. In the basement were shower areas, a six-lane swimming pool, and a six-lane bowling alley. Offices for the new Physical Education Department—which had been mandated by the state of Ohio a year earlier—and Intercollegiate Athletics were located on the first floor.\n\nWills Gym was hailed as \"one of finest gymnasiums in Ohio\" by the school's 1927 yearbook, \"The Chestnut Burr\", adding that teams who traveled to Kent for basketball or football games always wanted to see the gym. The first men's basketball game at Wills Gym was a 37–24 loss to Mount Union College on January 5, 1926 to open the 1925–26 season. A varsity wrestling team began play in 1928, followed by men's gymnastics in 1930, and men's swimming in 1936. The gym was also a frequent site for high school games and tournaments, and served as the home court for the Kent State High School Blue Devils until 1956.\n\nFollowing World War II, a large increase in the number of male students led to the expansion of the school, and of the athletic and physical education departments in particular, which included construction of a new Men's Physical Education Building. The new gym was completed in 1950 with seating for 7,000 and could hold as many as 10,000. It replaced Wills Gym as the home of men's physical education and as the venue for the men's basketball, swimming, and wrestling teams. The final men's basketball game at Wills was a 68–47 win over the Western Reserve Red Cats on March 7, 1950.\n\nMen's gymnastics continued to use Wills Gymnasium as their home venue and were joined by the women's gymnastics team in 1959, the first women's collegiate gymnastics team in the United States. The 1972 passage of Title IX led to the establishment of intercollegiate women's volleyball and women's basketball teams in 1975, with home games at Wills Gym. In addition to equal playing opportunities for female athletes, however, Title IX also required equal facilities for both men and women and the facilities at Wills were not only older and in deteriorating condition, but were considerably smaller than those at the Memorial Gym as the seating capacity at Wills Gym had been reduced to near 100 by the mid 1970s. Both women's teams initially played all or most of their schedule at Wills for their first few seasons before permanently moving to Memorial Gym for the 1977–78 seasons. The men's and women's gymnastics teams continued to have home meets at both Memorial and Wills through the 1979 season. The final gymnastics meet at Wills was the women's team's 150th win all-time.\n\nIn early 1970, most of the seats in the balcony were removed and the area was used to create classroom and office space. In the following years, structural and maintenance problems were evident and frequent, which may have been caused by the original swampy site. The building was closed and declared \"unsafe\" in March 1973, and while repairs were made to allow continued use of the gym, the building was not fully renovated. In late June 1979, just prior to the closure of the building, a large section of ceiling plaster above the pool collapsed. Offices and activities began moving to the new Memorial Gym Annex (now known as the MACC Annex) in mid July 1979 and demolition on Wills Gym began in early August 1979. The former offices of the physical education department remained after the demolition, known as Wills Hall, and served as the home of the Kent State chapter of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) from 1983–2000. Wills Hall was razed in 2000 as part of a renovation and expansion to adjacent Cartwright Hall, then known as the Auditorium Building.\n\nIn addition to physical education and intercollegiate and intramural athletics, Wills Gym hosted class registration for many years, and was also used for dances and other large social events, such as those related to homecoming. In 1940, Wills Gym was the site of the final game of the National Basketball League championship, between the Akron Firestone Non-Skids and Oshkosh All-Stars, won by Firestone 61–60. The game was moved to Kent from the Firestone gym in Akron because Wills Gym had a larger seating capacity than other facilities in the area at the time. During the 1940s, Wills was used for a high school basketball tournament featuring the rural schools of Portage County. The gym was also a regular site for Ohio high school sectional and district tournament games for both size classifications at the time, Class A and Class B, with some Class A games drawing capacity crowds in excess of 4,000 people.\n\nThe exterior facade of Wills Gym was brick with embedded columns and rectangular windows, similar to the adjacent Cartwright, Kent, and Merrill Halls, all of which were designed in the Neoclassical style, prominent in the early 20th century. Total space was with listed as \"assignable space\".\n\nThe interior was divided into three levels, with two levels above ground and the lower level just below ground. The main gymnasium occupied most of the upper two levels on one side. It featured large windows on three sides, and originally had a large skylight in the center over the gym floor. Three double doorways were located on the sideline opposite the balcony, which led to short staircases with access to the parking lot. On the fourth side on the upper level was the balcony section, which had fixed chairback seating and smaller windows on all three exterior walls near the ceiling. In 1970, the seating and tiers in the balcony were removed and the area was largely converted into additional classroom space. The remainder of the seating in the gym was provided by bleacher seats, which were located around the playing floor. On the ground floor under the balcony section were offices and storage areas, including a mail room. For a time, the campus police department also and an office in Wills Gym. A corridor in the center of the level connected Wills Gym with the adjacent University Auditorium in what is now known as Cartwright Hall.\n\nThe lower level mainly contained the pool and locker rooms, as well as the power and heating utilities rooms. When the building was dedicated in 1925, much of the basement was still unfinished. Originally, the lower level was a larger open space and also included a seating area adjacent to the pool and bowling alleys. The level was later subdivided into smaller rooms. There were windows on three sides of the basement level, but because it was mostly below ground, they were smaller and higher on the walls.\n\nThe area formerly occupied by Wills Gymnasium is mostly covered by a parking lot behind Cartwright Hall, which houses the 800-seat University Auditorium. The main lobby for the auditorium, built in 2002, is where Wills Hall stood and overlaps the northern end of Wills Gymnasium, over the part of the building that housed the physical education offices.\n"}

It serves as the national stadium and is used mostly for cricket matches. Other uses have included the World Creole Music Festival, the Finals of the Calypso Competition and the Miss Dominica pageant.\n\nThe stadium is of International Cricket Council (ICC) international standard with facilities featuring 12,000 seats, private boxes, a media centre, practice nets, a players' personality complex, digital score boards and five cricket pitches.\n\nThe ground was named after Windsor, England and is situated on the eastern side of Roseau. It was levelled out of a rubbish dump previously known as Cow Town. It was a popular venue for sports of all kinds, carnival activities, horse and donkey racing, State parades and played a central role in island life. In 1999 a national stadium was planned for the site, but after demolishing all of the existing stands and adjoining buildings, including a former school that had once been wards of the Roseau Hospital, the project was abandoned and the site was deserted until 2005.\n\nNew work on the stadium started on 23 March 2005, on the first anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and Dominica. The stadium is one of the 'Four Pillar Projects' promised by the People's Republic of China to Dominica as a result of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) during the establishment of ties between Dominica and China. The stadium is viewed as a gift at a cost of EC$33 million, (US$17 million, €12 million), from the government of the People's Republic of China to the government and people of the Commonwealth of Dominica.\n\nOn 7 February 2007, work on the Windsor Park Stadium was completed. Work on the facilities to accompany the stadium resulted in the stadium not being used before May 2007, therefore missing any activities relating to Cricket World Cup 2007, held in the Caribbean. The handing-over ceremony of the stadium from Chinese officials to Dominica took place on 23 March, marking the third year of diplomatic ties with the People's Republic. On 24 October 2007 the Windsor Park National Sport Stadium was official opened with a grand ceremony. The 11th Annual World Creole Music Festival (WCMF) was held on 25–27 Oct. as the stadium's first official activity.\n\nOn 6 February 2008, the Dominica national football team played their first 2010 World Cup qualifying match against Barbados in front of 4,200 spectators at Windsor Park.\n\nDominica hosted its first two One Day International cricket matches at Windsor Park Stadium, between West Indies and Bangladesh. The games were played on 26 July and 28 July in 2009.\n\nWindsor Park hosted its first Test match between West Indies and India from 6–10 July 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "47751858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47751858", "title": "Women's Professional Motocross", "text": "Women's Professional Motocross\n\nMotocross is an off road racing sport that is raced on a dirt bike around a track, there are multiple riders going around at a time and the first person to complete the required number of laps in the shortest period of time wins. The women's motocross league is separate from men's motocross because of the different rules, and also the different bike sizes. Women generally race bikes that are 125cc or 250cc because they are not big enough to ride a 450cc. These differences make it hard for men and women to compete together however it is done and is allowed. Women compete in the AMA races but rarely make it into the main event because their practice laps and heat laps are not fast enough. Women's professional motocross has the support of professional male riders also. Male riders think that growing the sport in anyway possible is a positive and that the more people riding the better the sport will be. As well as having the support from male riders, females are starting to step up and support their colleagues as well, by helping each other train and practice, there is support from both males and females that is helping the sport to go exponentially.\n\nMotocross started in approximately 1924 over in Europe and spread very quickly to the United States due to immigration and the moving of families for job and freedom opportunities. Women's professional motocross is an organized sports league where females can compete for money and prizes at the highest level of motocross. Women’s motocross began in Europe in the early 1950s and 1960s and moved to the United States in the middle of the 1960s. This was during the time that women’s equality movements were strong, helping the sport to grow. In 1971 Kerri Kleid was the first woman to receive a professional motocross rider license, which was revoked after it was discovered that she was a woman. When processing her license paperwork, the registry did not know that she was a female because there was no box that indicated this information. When she showed up at the first race in Unadilla, she was told that she could not race because she was a woman. Kerri then went to court and eventually won her license back. However, this was the first time in history when women understood that they could be professionals in the world of motocross. In 1974 the first Powder Puff National Championship took place which marked the first time that a specifically women’s National Championship was available for female motocross riders in the United States. The \"Powder Puff\" was a motocross event where women could race in heats in order to qualify for the main event, or the last race of the night with the chance to win the championship. In 1975 the event’s name was changed from the Powder Puff National Championship to the Women’s Motocross Nationals. The championship took place ever year consecutively from 1975 through today, although in 1982 and 1986 the races were not held. In 1996 the Women’s Motocross League (WML) was founded after the first Women’s Supercross Championships took place in 1995. Because of this the WML was allowed to petition to be a part of the AMA Pro Motocross Championship, which included the men’s ranks and races. This led to the creation of the Women’s Motocross Association, which was founded in 2004 and sold to MX Sports, a large motocross corporation, in 2009. The selling of this allows for women’s motocross to remain a permanent part of men's motocross and the motocross industry. This also caused a change in the naming of WMA to WMX, so that it would fit in with the rest of the corporation. In order to keep women racing factory teams started to offer female riders contracts so that they could get the women to race their motorcycles. Factory teams are large corporations and the main companies that produce and distribute motorcycles. There are over 250 factory teams in the United States alone including the major ones Suzuki, Yamaha, Honda, KTM, and Kawasaki. Without these sponsorships and contracts it is nearly impossible for a person to support a professional race team on their own, the cost is too much. In order to receive a factory ride, the women had to prove that they were on top of the game and that they were willing to work hard and put the hours necessarily in to get better. The training that they endure goes beyond just riding their dirt bike, it happens in the gym and on pedal bikes as well. These riders worked for the best bikes that money could buy, because if they did not they would be out of a job and also unable to support their racing. It costs over $200,000.00 a year for an elite motocross rider to be ready for the season. This includes having the best bike, the best trainers, spare parts, a way to get the bikes to the track, fuel costs and many more expenses.\n\nWomen's motocross is full of people who have a no quit mentality and are often heard saying things like \" I won't quit until I am physically unable to ride\". These mentalities are what keeps the sport alive and well, without them it would have died long ago. Women's motocross is a sport that requires dedication and constant work, so the people who are involved in it, both the riders and the teams, have to be mentally strong. In order to make this sport a success women had to put in hard work and be mentally strong, they heard the word no more times than most but kept going. Having a strong mentality is what allows women's sports at the professional level to be a success. Much like the male counterpart, professional women's racing requires hours of training in order to be on top. This league is full of only the best riders and the most successful women, so without the mental aspect, these women would not be able to compete in the league. The biological level of mental toughness plays a large role in the success of this sport, women who have had parents who did not allow them to quit and who pushed them harder than they though they could be pushed often came out on top because they were trained not to quit. There are physiological reasons that some athletes possess the ability to be best, the way that their mind functions and the hormonal excretions in their body allow them to push themselves hard and longer than the regular person. It was in their mind and heart to be the best, much like every other athlete, how a competitor does their job says a lot about who they are as a person, and how far they are willing to go in order to win.\n\nThere rider who stands out of the pack when talking about women's motocross is Ashley Fiolek, she has the ability to go above and beyond the normal realm of what is expected of the female rider. She also is able to set race and lap times that can compete with the highest-level male riders which is uncommon for not only motocross but most sports. Men typically have the upper hand due to physical attribute that cause them to be stronger and faster, however this rider is able to keep up with the best of both genders. She is the fastest female on the track and knows it, with a confidence that most women dream of having she takes each lap for what it is and has a level head that allows her to keep pushing and progressing.\n\nAshley Fiolek, a native of Dearborn Michigan, born on October 22, 1990 is the most accomplished rider of this generation, she has won more amateur and professional races than anyone else in her age group and has stayed on top for the longest period of time. She was born deaf which is one of the most important reasons for why she starting racing. Because Ashley was unable to hear and participate easily in team sports, she picked up riding due to the fact that she could do it by herself and not have to talk or hear anything other than the bike. Being deaf served as one of her greatest advantages while racing because she could not hear what was going on outside the track, she only had to focus on what she was doing which allowed her to dial in and focus at a level that most other riders are unable to do. She is able to get on the track and block everything else out other than the things that she is focusing on, such as jumping, cornering, and passing the competitors. Ashley started racing dirt bikes when she was just 7 years old, and has been racing ever since. Fiolek is a factory rider for team Honda, who she has been signed with ever since she was young. They give her the support that she needs in order to run the cleanest and most successful bike on the track. Through their sponsorship, Ashely is able to ride one of the best bikes available. At the young age of 21 Fiolek walked away from racing in the pros due to the impossible contracts and because the sport that she loved was taking a turn that she did not want to continue on with. Ashley now trains younger riders to be the best racers that they can. Though there are other influential riders in women's motocross, none hold the same list of accomplishments that Ashley does.\n"}

The draft took place over a 3 day time period from October 28, 2000 to October 30, 2000 during which time a total of 475 players were selected by the league's 8 teams from a pool of approximately 1,600 or so eligible players. The draft consisted of 59 rounds—10 rounds taking place on October 28, 15 rounds on October 29, and 34 rounds on October 30.\n\nThe draft was followed by a supplemental draft on December 29, 2000 during which 65 additional players were selected in an effort to completely fill out team rosters. Most eligible players came from either the CFL, the Arena Football League, NFL Europe, retired NFL players, or previous college players who had gone undrafted by the NFL but had not yet signed with another league.\n\nThe XFL draft took place in order for teams to be ready to begin league play when the season kicked off on February 3, 2001.\n\nMany of the players selected in the XFL draft went on to compete in the NFL and other football leagues.\n\nNotable players selected in the draft included future league MVP and Los Angeles quarterback Tommy Maddox, who signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers after the XFL eventually folded. Maddox later became the starting quarterback for the Steelers, and led them to the playoffs. Los Angeles used the first pick in the draft to select another future NFL quarterback, Scott Milanovich. Milanovich lost the starting quarterback job to Maddox, who was placed on the Xtreme as one of a handful of players put on each team due to geographic distance between the player's college and the team's hometown. Another of the eventually better-known players who was selected in the draft was Las Vegas running back Rod Smart, who first gained popularity because the name on the back of his jersey read \"\"He Hate Me.\" Smart stated that he had wanted to put \"They Hate Me\"\" (a jab at his critics) but there wasn't enough room. Smart, who was only picked 357th in the draft, later went on to play for the Philadelphia Eagles, Carolina Panthers, and the Oakland Raiders, thus becoming the second XFL player (after receiver Yo Murphy did as a member of the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI) to play in a Super Bowl, participating in Super Bowl XXXVIII, which his team lost. His Panther teammate Jake Delhomme named his new-born horse \"She Hate Me\" as a reference to Smart. Maddox became the third former XFL player to play for a Super Bowl team (Pittsburgh Steelers), in Super Bowl XL in Detroit, and he was the first to win a Super Bowl ring, although Maddox did not play in the game.\n\nMany other XFL \"alumni\" who were selected in the draft went on to play in the NFL, including Kevin Kaesviharn, Jose Cortez, Corey Ivy, Mike Furrey and Rod Smart, and many others played extensively in the CFL, including Kelvin Anderson, John Avery, Duane Butler, Jeremaine Copeland, Marcus Crandell, Reggie Durden, Eric England, Paul McCallum (who wore the jersey nickname \"CFL Reject\"), Yo Murphy, Noel Prefontaine and Bobby Singh. The Arena Football League also absorbed some former XFL players.\n"}
