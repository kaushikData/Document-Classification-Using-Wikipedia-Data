There are only 42 steps from event level to concourse level to ensure that every seat in the arena is a good one.\n\nJust over three years after opening, GCU Arena closed on March 3, 2014 to undergo a massive remodel. With the quicker than anticipated jump to Division I athletics for the Grand Canyon Antelopes athletic programs, the school announced the expansion of the arena from a capacity of 5,000 to 7,000 seats. The growth of the arena was primarily intended to incorporate adequate seating for the men's basketball games and for larger concerts.\n\nArizona sports icon Jerry Colangelo, who is closely connected with the athletic program, was involved in the expansion process, stating: \"If GCU knew when the building went up just a couple of years ago that they would be in Division I as quickly as we have, it would have been built bigger.\" \n\nAfter a proposed finish date of October 17, the Arena opened nearly six weeks ahead of schedule on August 23 for a Switchfoot concert as a part of the school's 2014 Welcome Weekend.

{"id": "1409767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1409767", "title": "High-intensity interval training", "text": "High-intensity interval training\n\nHigh-intensity interval training (HIIT), also called high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) or sprint interval training (SIT), is a form of interval training, a cardiovascular exercise strategy alternating short periods of intense anaerobic exercise with less intense recovery periods, until too exhausted to continue. Though there is no universal HIIT session duration, these intense workouts typically last under 30 minutes, with times varying based on a participant's current fitness level.\n\nHIIT workouts provide improved athletic capacity and condition as well as improved glucose metabolism. Compared with other regimens, HIIT may not be as effective for treating hyperlipidemia and obesity, or improving muscle and bone mass. However, research has shown that HIIT regimens produced significant reductions in the fat mass of the whole-body. Some researchers also note that HIIT requires \"an extremely high level of subject motivation\" and question whether the general population could safely or practically tolerate the extreme nature of the exercise regimen.\n\nHIIT exercise sessions generally consist of a warm up period, then several repetitions of high-intensity exercise separated by medium intensity exercise for recovery, then a cool down period. The high-intensity exercise should be done at near maximum intensity. The medium exercise should be about 50% intensity. The number of repetitions and length of each depends on the exercise, but may be as little as three repetitions with just 20 seconds of intense exercise The specific exercises performed during the high-intensity portions vary. Most of the research on HIIT has been done using a cycling ergometer, but other exercises like running, stair climbing and uphill walking can also be effective.\n\nThere is no specific formula to HIIT. Depending on one's level of cardiovascular development, the moderate-level intensity can be as slow as walking A common formula involves a 2:1 ratio of work to recovery periods, for example, 30–40 seconds of hard sprinting alternated with 15–20 seconds of jogging or walking, repeated to failure.\n\nThe entire HIIT session may last between four and thirty minutes, meaning that it is considered to be an excellent way to maximize a workout that is limited by time constraints.\nUse of a clock or timer is recommended to keep accurate times, the number of rounds, and intensity.\n\nA type of high-intensity interval training with short recovery periods was used in the 1970s by the athletics coach Peter Coe when setting sessions for his son Sebastian Coe. Inspired by the principles propounded by the German coach and university professor Woldemar Gerschler and the Swedish physiologist Per-Olof Åstrand, Coe set sessions involving repeated fast 200 metre runs with only 30 seconds recovery between each fast run.\n\nA version of HIIT was based on a 1996 study by Professor Izumi Tabata (田畑泉) et al. initially involving Olympic speedskaters. The study used 20 seconds of ultra-intense exercise (at an intensity of about 170% of VOmax) followed by 10 seconds of rest, repeated continuously for 4 minutes (8 cycles). The exercise was performed on a mechanically braked cycle ergometer. Tabata called this the IE1 protocol. In the original study, athletes using this method trained 4 times per week, plus another day of steady-state training, for 6 weeks and obtained gains similar to a group of athletes who did steady state training (70% VOmax) 5 times per week. The steady state group had a higher VOmax at the end (from 52 to 57 mL/(kg•min)), but the Tabata group had started lower and gained more overall (from 48 to 55 mL/(kg•min)). Also, only the Tabata group had gained anaerobic capacity benefits. In the original study from 1996, participants were disqualified if they could not keep a steady cycling pace of 85RPM for the full 20 seconds of work.\n\nIn popular culture, \"Tabata training\" has now come to refer to a wide variety of HIIT protocols and exercise regimens that may or may not have similar benefits to those found in Tabata's original study.\n\nProfessor Martin Gibala and his team at McMaster University in Canada have been researching high-intensity exercise for several years. Their 2010 study on students uses 3 minutes for warming up, then 60 seconds of intense exercise (at 95% of VOmax) followed by 75 seconds of rest, repeated for 8–12 cycles (sometimes referred to as \"The Little Method\"). Subjects using this method training 3 times per week obtained gains similar to what would be expected from subjects who did steady state (50–70% VOmax) training five times per week. While still a demanding form of training, this exercise protocol could be used by the general public with nothing more than an average exercise bike.\n\nGibala's group published a less intense version of their regimen in a 2011 paper in \"Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\". This was intended as a gentler option for sedentary people who had done no exercise for over a year. It included 3 minutes of warm-up, 10 repetitions of 60-second bursts at 60% peak power (80–95% of heart rate reserve) each followed by 60 seconds of recovery, and then a 5-minute cool-down.\n\nJorge Zuniga, assistant professor of exercise science at Creighton University, set out to determine how to fit the highest volume of work and oxygen consumption into the smallest amount of time. He found that intervals of 30 seconds at 90% of power output at VO max followed by 30 seconds of rest allowed for the highest VO consumption and the longest workout duration at specified intensity. Alternative protocols considered included 100% of maximum power output on the same interval schedule, similar to the Coe regimen, and 90% of maximum power output for three minutes, similar to traditional interval training.\n\nZuniga's protocol has been implemented to great success by his students participating in Creighton's Army ROTC program. Cadets completing the protocol twice a week saw greater improvements in APFT scores than in years past.\n\nDr Niels Vollaard at the University of Stirling proposed that when high-intensity intervals are done at ‘all-out’ intensities, associated health benefits plateau after performing 2 or 3 sprint repetitions. This led to the development of a 10-minute exercise routine consisting of easy pedalling interspersed with two 20-second ‘all-out’ cycling sprints. In a 2017 meta-analysis, Vollaard indeed showed that common protocols with as many as 6 to 10 repetitions of 30-second ‘all-out’ sprints do not improve aerobic fitness more than the ‘2x20-s’ protocol. It is claimed that this short protocol may remove many of the drawbacks that make other high-intensity interval training protocols unsuitable for the general population.<ref name=\"Vollaard/Metcalfe\"></ref>\n\nIn a BBC \"Horizon\" programme in February 2012, Jamie Timmons, professor of systems biology at the University of Loughborough, put Michael Mosley through this exercise bike regimen, but with three sprints instead of two. This was done three times a week for a total of 30 minutes of exercise per week (3 minutes of intense exercise), plus warm-up and recovery time.\n\nWood et al. compared high-intensity interval training of eight 1-minute bouts at 85% Wmax interspersed with a 1-minute active recovery at 25% Wmax v Sprint interval training of eight 30-second bouts at 130% Wmax interspersed with 90-second active recovery at 25% Wmax. (Total time matched at 24 mins including warm up & cool down). Their conclusion was \"HIIT is the recommended routine\" but \"the magnitude of differences in various parameters between regimens was small; therefore, preference for either modality may be up to the individual\".\n\nA 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that HIIT training and traditional endurance training both lead to significantly improved cardiovascular fitness in healthy adults ages 18–45 but greater improvements in VO max were seen in those participating in the HIIT exercise regimen. Another analysis also found that HIIT regimens of one month or longer effectively improve cardiovascular fitness in adolescents and lead to moderate improvements in body composition. Furthermore, a separate systematic review and meta-analysis of seven small randomized controlled trials found that HIIT (defined as four intervals of four minutes at 85–95% of max heart rate with three-minute intervals at 60–70% of max heart rate) was more effective than moderate-intensity continuous training at improving blood vessel function and markers of blood vessel health.\n\nA 2015 meta-analysis comparing HIIT to moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) in people with coronary artery disease found that HIIT leads to greater improvements in VO max but that MICT leads to greater reductions in body weight and heart rate. A 2014 meta-analysis found that the cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by VO max, of individuals with lifestyle-induced chronic cardiovascular or metabolic diseases (including high blood pressure, obesity, heart failure, coronary artery disease, or metabolic syndrome) who completed a HIIT exercise program was nearly double that of individuals who completed a MICT exercise program. In a study published out of Arizona State in 2018 found that, \"HIIE protocols performed ∼18 h before ingestion of a high-energy fast food meal attenuated but did not entirely eliminate postprandial endothelial dysfunction in young men largely by improving fasting endothelial function.\" These findings suggest that HIIT training has a physiologically protective mechanism associated with it which can carry over into successive days of non-training.\n\nHIIT significantly lowers insulin resistance compared to continuous training or control conditions and leads to modestly decreased fasting blood glucose levels and increased weight loss compared to those who do not undergo a physical activity intervention. Another study found that HIIT was more effective than moderate-intensity continuous training at fasting insulin levels (31% decrease and 9% decrease, respectively).\n\nA 2007 study examined HIIT's physiological effects on fat oxidation in moderately active women. The participants in the study performed HIIT (defined as ten sets of 4-minute cycling bursts at an intensity of 90% VO2max separated by 2 minutes of rest) every other day over a 2-week period. The study found that seven sessions of HIIT over a 2-week period improved whole body fat oxidation and the capacity for skeletal muscle to oxidize fat in moderately active women. A 2010 systematic review of HIIT summarized the results of HIIT on fat loss and stated that HIIT can result in modest reductions of subcutaneous fat in young and healthy individuals, but greater reductions for overweight individuals.\n\nA 2017 study examined the effect of HIIT on cognitive performance among a group of children (N=318). The authors show that HIIT is beneficial to cognitive control and working memory capacity when compared against \"a blend of board games, computer games, and trivia quizzes\" and that this effect is mediated by the BDNF polymorphism. They conclude that the study \"suggests a promising alternative to enhance cognition, via short and potent exercise regimens\".\n\n\n"}

Created as \"Glucozade\" in the UK in 1927 by a Newcastle pharmacist, William Walker Hunter (trading as W. Owen & Son), it was acquired by the British pharmaceutical company Beecham's in 1938 and sold as an energy drink for the sick as Lucozade. The company's advertising slogan was \"Lucozade aids recovery\".\n\nA glucose–water solution, the product was sold until 1983 as a carbonated, slightly orange-flavoured drink in a glass bottle wrapped in yellow cellophane. Pharmacists sold it, children were given it when ill, and hospital visitors would regularly arrive with a bottle. It was rebranded as a \"pick me up\" in 1978 and as a sports drink in 1983 to associate it with health rather than sickness. The company switched to a plastic bottle and introduced a range of flavours. As of 2016, a 500 ml bottle contained 62 g (15.5 cubes) of sugar, more than Coca-Cola. In 2017, to avoid sugar tax, the drink was reformulated to contain 4.5 g of sugar per 100 ml of liquid and the artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame K.\n\nIn 1989 the Beecham Group merged to form SmithKline Beecham, which in 2000 merged to form GlaxoSmithKline. In September 2013 GlaxoSmithKline sold Lucozade and another soft drink, Ribena, to the Japanese conglomerate Suntory for £1.35 billion.\n\n\"Glucozade\" was invented by William Walker Hunter in 1927 in Newcastle; Hunter had taken over the business of pharmacist William Owen. Hunter sold the product to Beecham Group in 1938 and it was eventually renamed to Lucozade.\n\nIn 1953, a factory for the production of Lucozade products was opened in Brentford, which, until 2004, had an iconic sign seen on the side of the M4 motorway (now in Gunnersbury Park Museum). \n\nLucozade originally was available in only one variety, which was effervescent with a distinctive sweet citric flavour. It was sold in a glass bottle with a yellow cellophane wrap until 1983, when Lucozade was rebranded as an energy drink to shift the brand's associations away from illness. The slogan \"Lucozade aids recovery\" was replaced by \"Lucozade replaces lost energy\". The glass bottle was replaced by a plastic (polyethylene terephthalate, PET) one. After the rebranding, between 1984 and 1989 UK sales tripled to almost £75 million.\n\nIn 1989 the Beecham Group and SmithKline Beckman merged to form SmithKline Beecham, and in 2000 SmithKline Beecham and GlaxoWellcome merged to form GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). In 2013 GSK put Ribena and Lucozade up for sale. Suntory, a Japanese holding company, bought the brands in September for £1.35 billion. At the time of the sale, the product was manufactured in England at the Royal Forest Factory in Coleford, Gloucestershire, in the Forest of Dean.\n\nThe following flavours are currently available in the UK:\n\nThe following flavours are currently sold as Zero Energy products:\n\nThe following flavours were previously sold in the UK:\n\nThe following flavours are available in Australia:\n\nA stated purpose of sports drinks, which provide many calories of energy from sugars, is to improve performance and endurance. In an analysis by Matthew Thompson and colleagues from the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, of 431 marketing claims of performance enhancement, most cited no evidence. 174 sources were cited for Lucozade; of them, Thompson found only three studies of high quality with a low risk of bias. The rigorous studies that did show improved endurance were \"of limited relevance to most people because the tests were on elite athletes\". Thompson said that for the vast majority of people drinking such products \"could completely counteract exercising more, playing football more, going to the gym more\".\n\nThe drinks are marketed as soft drinks; a soft drinks industry spokesman said in response \"By helping people participating in sport to perform better and to recover more quickly, sports drinks can encourage people to exercise more\".\n\nIn May 2016, Liverpool City Council started a campaign against so-called \"sugary drinks\". The \"name and shame\" campaign, entitled “Is your child’s sweet tooth harming their health?”, claimed that Lucozade was the worst offender, containing 62 grams of sugar in a 500 ml bottle, followed by Coca-Cola with 54 grams. Posters for the campaign \"were displayed in doctors' surgeries and hospitals.\"\n\nIn its original high sugar content formulation Lucozade was recommended by UK diabetes charities as an immediate treatment for hypoglycemia in individuals who take insulin. Since its change to use of artificial sweeteners guidelines have been changed to state that Lucozade should not be used to treat diabetic hypos.<ref>\n"}

There are over 900 SmartCourts installed around the world, including with the NBA's Golden State Warriors, Toronto Raptors and Phoenix Suns and close to 50 NCAA sports programs, including Harvard University, the University of Southern California, and Princeton University. The United States Tennis Association installed PlaySight's SmartCourt technology on 32 courts at its new national campus in Lake Nona, Florida. PlaySight was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies for 2017.\n\nIn 2010, PlaySight was founded in Kfar Saba, Israel, using technology with roots in the Israeli military. After years developing weaponry and war simulators for the Israeli army and other defense clients, the three partners looked to apply their skills and knowledge to a new challenge. After one of the partners, Evgeni Khazanov, observed his daughter’s tennis practice, he wondered why a sport with so much money did not have any advanced technology to help players improve their game. It was from that idea that PlaySight was born. \n\nPlaySight has continued to grow through partnerships and investment from players in the tennis industry including Billie Jean King, Ana Ivanovic, Chris Evert, Pete Sampras, Novak Djokovic, Tommy Haas, Paul Annacone, and Darren Cahill. Other notable investors include Bill Ackman, Mark Ein, Dr. James Loehr, Gordon Uehling III, and George Mackin. Since the technology was commercialized in 2013, the technology has been adapted for numerous other sports including soccer, martial arts, volleyball, squash, handball, gymnastics, dancing, hockey and wrestling. So far, PlaySight has raised over $20 million and now has offices in Kfar Saba, New Jersey and Los Angeles.\n\nIn June 2017, Verizon Ventures and golfer Greg Norman announced an $11 million investment in PlaySight to further SmartCourt expansion in tennis, basketball and other sports and to also introduce the technology to golf.\n\nPlaySight installed its first SmartSchools in 2017 – fully wired high school campuses (including Trinity-Pawling School, Oaks Christian School and Sierra Canyon School with PlaySight across several sports – basketball, ice hockey, soccer and more.\n\nA PlaySight \"SmartCourt\" is a system of fully automated HD cameras that record, stream and analyze all on-court action.For tennis, the technology uses image processing and analytical algorithms to track strokes, ball trajectory, player movement and shot speed and spin. PlaySight's SmartCourt system provides players and coaches instant multi-angle video and detailed statistics through the court side kiosk and on tablets and mobile devices. Their cloud-based platform allows teams to live stream matches and stores all video from SmartCourt sessions for coaches and players to review later from any web enabled device. In 2017, PlaySight unveiled its SmartField technology for soccer and also released its SmartTracker technology - an autonomous 4K camera that follows all on-court action automatically.\n\nCheating has become a prominent issue in tennis particularly on junior circuits where players call their own lines. PlaySight developed the idea of PlayFair Tournaments that use the line-calling feature of PlaySight's SmartCourt technology to tackle the cheating problem in tennis. These tournaments allow players to challenge close line calls and use the PlaySight court side kiosk to access video replay to confirm or overrule the call. PlayFair Tournaments have been organized at both the junior club and collegiate levels.'\n\nIn late 2017, PlaySight and the ITA announced an expansion of the PlayFair initiative, bringing the technology to close to 30 NCAA dual matches for the 2018 season.\n\nPlaySight expanded into basketball, volleyball, soccer, and several other sports in 2017.\n"}

In 2016 the Prospects were granted naming rights to the facility as the old name had expired. The facility is located in the North Saskatchewan River Valley, in the neighbourhood of Rossdale.\n\nOpened in 1995, Telus Field replaced the 60-year-old John Ducey Park (formerly \"Renfrew Park\") on the same site. The stadium's naming rights were purchased by the Telus telecommunications company in September 1995 for a 14-year deal.\nIt has walls all the way around except in centre field, where the batter's eye is a green monster which is the third highest wall in professional baseball. Three players, Matthew LeCroy, Michael Cuddyer, and Todd Sears have hit home runs over it. Telus Field held the IBAF World Cup Women's baseball in the summer of 2004 and from July 25 to August 3, 2008, the park held the IBAF AAA World Junior Championships for the 7th time since it started in 1981.\n\nDespite Telus's naming rights expiring in 2009 the stadium continued to use the name Telus Field until opening the 2016 season as Edmonton Ballpark, or simply Ballpark. Being displaced by the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, the Fort McMurray Giants played their inaugural season at the then Edmonton Ballpark. In May 2017 the stadium was renamed RE/MAX Field by the Edmonton Prospects; gaining naming rights and naming the park after the team's sponsor, RE/MAX, for three years.\n\nRE/MAX Field uses natural grass in the outfield and FieldTurf in the infield; originally AstroTurf was used but it was replaced in 2005 with the more modern type of turf, FieldTurf. Artificial turf was chosen for lower maintenance costs, because it allows for a better drainage system so the infield can return to a playable state quicker than a grass infield would, and to minimize damage to the infield when concerts are held at the stadium.\n\nThe park has ground-level luxury suites with box and general seating built on top. The Home Plate VIP Lounge on the main concourse is located directly behind the plate, incorporating a bar and a restaurant with a view of the field from seats inside and outside. The lounge includes trophies and pictures of early Edmonton baseball teams.

After the 2010 sale of the corporation to Toronto Dominion Bank, the arena's name changed to TD Arena. The playing surface is named John Kresse Court in honor of legendary Charleston men's basketball coach John Kresse.\n\nOriginally to be named Carolina First Center, the facility was renamed Carolina First Arena to avoid confusion with the bank's south coast main offices in Charleston which are located in an office building by the same name.\n\nThe first game played at the arena on November 14, 2008 was a first round game of the inaugural ESPN Charleston Classic between Texas Christian University and Western Michigan University won by TCU 67-63.\n\nPerhaps the biggest game in arena history was an 82-79 Charleston victory in overtime over then-No. 9 ranked and defending national champion North Carolina on January 4, 2010.\n\nThe arena not only plays host to Cougars' basketball games, but it also hosts many other campus events, including orientations, campus tours, award ceremonies, and external events (including concerts for Hootie & Spoleto Festival). The TD Arena is overseen by Josh Bryson, Director of Operations. He is assisted by Kelsea McGrogan, Assistant Director of Operations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "464128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=464128", "title": "The Bad News Bears", "text": "The Bad News Bears\n\nThe Bad News Bears is a 1976 American sports comedy film directed by Michael Ritchie. It stars Walter Matthau and Tatum O'Neal. The film was followed by two sequels, \"The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training\" in 1977 and \"The Bad News Bears Go to Japan\" in 1978, a short-lived 1979–80 CBS television series, and a 2005 remake.\n\nThe original screenplay was written by Bill Lancaster. Notable was the score by Jerry Fielding, which is an adaptation of the principal themes of Bizet's opera \"Carmen\".\n\nMorris Buttermaker, an alcoholic and former minor-league baseball pitcher, is recruited by Bob Whitewood, a city councilman and attorney who filed a lawsuit against an ultra-competitive Southern California Youth Baseball League which excluded the least skilled athletes (including his son) from playing. In order to settle the lawsuit, the league agrees to add an additional team - the Bears - which is composed of the worst players. Buttermaker becomes the coach of the unlikely team, which includes (among others) a near-sighted pitcher, an overweight catcher, a foulmouthed shortstop with a Napoleon complex, an outfielder who dreams of emulating his idol Hank Aaron, two non-English-speaking Mexican immigrants, a withdrawn and bullied boy named Timmy Lupus, and a motley collection of other \"talent\". Shunned by the more competitive teams (and competitive parents), the Bears are the outsiders. They play their opening game, and do not even record an out, giving up 26 runs before Buttermaker forfeits the game.\n\nRealizing the team is nearly hopeless, he recruits a couple of unlikely prospects: sharp-tongued Amanda Whurlizer, a skilled pitcher (trained by Buttermaker when she was younger) who is the 12-year-old daughter of one of Buttermaker's ex-girlfriends. At first, she tries to convince Buttermaker that she has given up baseball, but then she reveals that she had been practicing \"on the sly\". Before agreeing to join the team, Amanda makes a number of outlandish demands (such as imported jeans, modeling school, ballet lessons, etc.) as conditions for joining. Upon hearing her demands, Buttermaker asks, \"Who do you think you are, Catfish Hunter?\" Amanda responds by asking, \"Who's he?\" Rounding out the team, Buttermaker recruits the \"best athlete in the area,\" who also happens to be the local cigarette-smoking, loan-sharking, Harley-Davidson-riding troublemaker, Kelly Leak. With Whurlizer and Leak on board, the team starts gaining more confidence, and the Bears start winning games.\n\nEventually, the unlikely Bears make it to the championship game opposite the top-notch Yankees, who are coached by aggressive, competitive Roy Turner. As the game progresses, tensions are ratcheted up as Buttermaker and Turner engage in shouting matches, directing their players to become increasingly more ruthless and competitive against each other, going as far as fighting, spiking on slide, or the batter getting hit on purpose.\n\nThe turnaround point of the game comes after a heated exchange between Turner's son (and Yankees pitcher) Joey and the Bears at-bat catcher Engelberg. Turner orders his son to walk Engelberg, the only Bears hitter he cannot overcome, despite Joey's wish to give it a try. In response, Joey intentionally throws a wild beanball nearly striking Engelberg in the head. Horrified, Turner goes to the mound and slaps his son. On the next pitch, Engelberg hits a routine ground ball back to Joey who exacts revenge against his father by holding the ball until Engelberg has an inside the park home run. Joey then leaves the game dropping the ball at his father's feet.\n\nButtermaker, realizing that he has become as competitive as Turner, puts the benchwarmers on the field, thus giving everyone a chance to play. In spite of this, the finish-up brings up the best team-play from the Bears. After loading the bases with smart tactics (two walks and a bunt) they nearly recover a four run difference, with the last runner getting taken out at the last moment.\n\nAfter having narrowly lost the game 7 to 6, Buttermaker gives the team free rein of his beer cooler. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of having come a long way. The condescending Yankees congratulate the Bears telling them that although they are still not that good, they have \"guts.\" Tanner, the shortstop, replies by telling the Yankees where they can put their trophy. The Bears cheer and Timmy Lupus overcomes his chronic shyness enough to yell \"Wait 'til next year!\", then they spray their beers all over each other. The movie ends with a field celebration that makes it look as if they won the game.\n\n\nTatum O'Neal was paid $350,000 plus a percentage of the profits. These were later estimated to be $1.9 million.\n\n\"The Bad News Bears\" was filmed in and around Los Angeles, primarily in the San Fernando Valley. The field where they played is in Mason Park on Mason Avenue in Chatsworth. In the film, the Bears were sponsored by an actual company, Chico's Bail Bonds. One scene was filmed in the council chamber at Los Angeles City Hall.\n\nRotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 97% based on reviews from 30 critics and an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"The Bad News Bears\" is rude, profane, and cynical, but shot through with honest, unforced humor, and held together by a deft, understated performance from Walter Matthau.\"\n\nIn his 1976 review, critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and called it \"an unblinking, scathing look at competition in American society\". Gene Siskel awarded two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling the film's characters \"more types than people\" and the kids' foul-mouth dialogue \"overdone,\" though he found O'Neal's performance \"genuinely affecting.\" \"Variety\" called it \"the funniest adult-child comedy film since 'Paper Moon',\" and lauded the \"excellent\" script. Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" declared it \"the best American screen comedy of the year to date,\" adding, \"Bright, pugnacious and utterly realistic as most children seem to be today, these kids are drawn with much accuracy and are played beautifully.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" found the film only \"occasionally funny\" but praised screenwriter Bill Lancaster for \"the talent and discipline to tell the story of 'The Bad News Bears' almost completely in terms of what happens on the baseball diamond or in the dugout.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" praised it as \"a lively, spontaneously funny entertainment\" that \"could rally a large parallel audience seeking less innocuous and stereotyped pictures with and about children.\" Tom Milne of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" called it \"miraculously funny and entirely delightful.\"\n\nWalter Matthau was nominated for a BAFTA award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy. The screenplay by Bill Lancaster, son of actor Burt Lancaster, was winner of a Writers Guild of America award.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" did a parody of the film with Matthau as the guest host called \"The Bad News Bees\" with John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and the rest in their recurring bee costumes for what would be their final time. This subtly referenced masturbation which was alluded to as \"buzzing-off\".\n\nAmerican Film Institute\n\n"}

{"id": "848348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=848348", "title": "Wheelchair basketball", "text": "Wheelchair basketball\n\nWheelchair basketball is basketball played by people with varying physical disabilities that disqualify them from playing an able-bodied sport. These include spina bifida, birth defects, cerebral palsy, paralysis due to accident, amputations (of the legs, or other parts), and many other disabilities. The International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF) is the governing body for this sport. It is recognized by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) as the sole competent authority in wheelchair basketball worldwide. FIBA has recognized IWBF under Article 53 of its General Statutes.\n\nThe IWBF has 82 National Organizations for Wheelchair Basketball (NOWBs) participating in wheelchair basketball throughout the world, with this number increasing each year. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people play wheelchair basketball from recreation to club play and as elite national team members. Wheelchair basketball is played by boys, girls, men and women.\n\nWheelchair basketball is included in the Paralympic Games. The Wheelchair Basketball World Championship is played two years after every Paralympic Games. Major competition in wheelchair basketball comes from Canada, Australia, the United States, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Japan.\n\nIn 1944, Ludwig Guttmann, through the rehabilitation program at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital, in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, adapted existing sports to use wheelchairs. It was known as wheelchair netball.\n\nAt around the same times, starting from 1946, wheelchair basketball games were played primarily between American World War II disabled veterans. This began in the United States at the University of Illinois. Dr. Timothy Nugent founded the National Wheelchair Basketball Association in 1949 and served as commissioner for the first twenty-five years.\n\nThe Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games, held in 1947, were the first games to be held and included only a handful of participants (26), and few events (shot put, javelin, club throw, and archery).\n\nThe number of wheelchair events and participants grew quickly. Wheelchair netball was introduced in the 1948 Games. In 1952, a team from the Netherlands was invited to compete with the British team. This became the first International Stoke-Mandeville Games (ISMG), an event that has been held annually ever since.\n\nWheelchair basketball, as we know it now, was first played at the 1956 International Stoke-Mandeville Games. The US \"Pan Am Jets\" team won the tournament.\n\nIn 1973, the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF) established the first sub-section for wheelchair basketball. At that time ISMGF was the world governing body for all wheelchair sports.\n\nIn 1989 ISMGF accepted for its former wheelchair basketball sub-section to be named International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF).\n\nFull independence came in 1993 with the IWBF becoming the world body for wheelchair basketball with full responsibility for development of the sport. Over the following years IWBF membership grew in size and based on the number of National Organizations for Wheelchair Basketball (NOWBs) with active programs, the international federation configured itself into four geographical zones: Africa, Americas, Asia/Oceania and Europe.\n\nWorld championships for the sport have been held since 1973, with Bruges, Belgium being the first host city. The first world championship for men was won by Great Britain. Of the first 11 men's world championships, six were won by the United States (1979, 1983, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002); and once each by Great Britain (the first ever championship in 1973), Israel (1975), France (1990), Canada (2006) and Australia (2010). Canada has won four of the women's world championship titles (1994, 1998, 2002, 2006), and the United States two (1990, 2010).\n\nWheelchair basketball retains most major rules and scoring of basketball, and maintains a 10-foot basketball hoop and standard basketball court. The exceptions are rules which have been modified with consideration for the wheelchair. For example, \"travelling\" in wheelchair basketball occurs when the athlete touches their wheels more than twice after receiving or dribbling the ball. The individual must pass, bounce or shoot the ball before touching the wheels again.\n\nIn some countries such as Canada, Australia and England, non-disabled athletes using wheelchairs are allowed to compete alongside other athletes on mixed teams.\n\nClassification is an international regulation for playing wheelchair basketball to harmonize players' different levels of disabilities. All teams which compete above a recreational level use the classification system to evaluate the functional abilities of players on a point scale of 1 to 4.5. Minimally disabled athletes are classified as a 4.5, and an individual with the highest degree of disability (such as a paraplegic with a complete injury below the chest) would be classified as a 1.0. Competitions restrict the number of points allowable on the court at one time. The five players from each team on the court during play may not exceed a total of 14 points. In places where teams are integrated, non-disabled athletes compete as either a 4.5 in Canada or a 5.0 in Europe; however, non-disabled athletes are not allowed to compete internationally.\n\nBasketball wheelchairs are designed for enhanced stability. The center of gravity is where the chair and the athlete's mass are equally distributed in all directions. Points at which the wheelchair can tip over sideways are the fulcrum. A wheelchair with a higher seat is easier to tip. Basketball chairs have lower seats and wheels that are angled outward so that the center of gravity has to move a greater distance before it passes over the fulcrum and tips the chair. Guards use wheelchairs different from those of centers and forwards. Forwards and centers are typically under the net, their chairs have higher seats and therefore less mobility, but the height increases the player's reach for shots at the hoop and for rebounds. Guards have lower seats and therefore greater stability for ball handling and getting down the court as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n"}
