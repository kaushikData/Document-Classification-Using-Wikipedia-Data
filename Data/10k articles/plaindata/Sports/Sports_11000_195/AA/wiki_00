The Challenge was concluded successfully in Cyprus on 7 October, 27 days later. The event was funded by Ferrero, the chocolate maker. The Challenge was timed to coincide with the European Year of Volunteering and to raise funds for charity.\n\nThe first aim of the challenge was to break the world record of consecutive full marathons (42.2 km) in different countries back to back. This was accomplished using a wide range of transport including and primarily a 4-bed camper van that was driven by professional driver Lawrence Cachia from Malta. Nathan was supported by Clifford Sultana who cycled adjacent to provide food and hydration on the run. A number of journalists joined the camper van for days or short stretches to record the event. Each run started at a designated time in various European cities and the official marathon or equivalent recognised distance was measured and covered.\n\nThe second aim of the challenge was to raise funds for children's charities in the countries visited. Over €100,000 was raised (including Ferrero sponsorship) for charities chosen by the Ferrero representative in each country. The largest fundraising effort came from Malta, and was shared between Inspire Foundation and the Daniel Delicata Memorial Association for the construction of a children's outdoor play area at the new national Mater Dei Hospital. Other charities benefitted across the EU including the Children's Society in England.\n\nMedical Interest - due to the extreme nature of the event a number of medical professionals monitored Nathan's health. Nathan is not a professional athlete and therefore there was worry about the ability of his body to tolerate the 300 km or so a week of running, for 4 whole weeks. Surprisingly, Nathan suffered no major ill effects except for a muscle tear in Marathon 10. Subsequently, his finishing times improved as the days past with the majority of the runs finishing under 4hrs. His fastest was 3hr34min (number 26 in Greece) and his slowest was Rotterdam where he was injured (in 4hr 40min).\n\nVeracity of success - Nathan was tracked by live GPS spotter to confirm distance covered, as well as being followed by eyewitnesses and the media in most countries.\n\n"}

The modern and quickly developing form of the martial art is single combat which have received popularity for full contact duels while offering minimum risk of trauma to sportsmen.\n\nARB's origin as a military-applied martial art dates back to 1979 when the city of Kaunas (the settlement Gajzhjunaj, military unit n.o. 42235) held the first championship for Airborne troops on the sports base of the 7th division of guards of Airborne troops. Since then, the Airborne troops' ARB championships have been held annually. ARB was created by experts and enthusiasts of physical preparation and was played as a sport of the Soviet Army. It was also successfully introduced into the Soviet army to train soldiers.\n\nCarrying out of the first championship on ARB would not have been possible without long-term practice and experiments with various kinds of single combat. Black belt-rated sportsmen and prize-winners of competitions in boxing, wrestling, judo and other fighting sports were carefully selected to participate in a game of ARB. Methodical work of fighters and commanders, has also impulsed to the origin of the martial art which is nowadays widely known under the name \"Army Hand-to-Hand Combat\". At that point in time (the beginning of 1970's) actual training of regular soldiers for hand-to-hand combat was named \"as the Program of preparation of instructors in sports and special receptions of a landing\".\n\nA distinctive part of ARB that sets it apart from other full contact single combat martial arts is the possibility of finishing with the opponent on hands and feet from a standing position. The opponent may call \"Stop\", as some kicks on the head of the opponent may not be protected by a helmet, and can lead to heavy damages that interrupt the sport immediately. Blows of the opponent by a foot in a head is a knock-down to the fighter who has performed such a blow. \n\n\n"}

Dart golf games use golf-like rules and scoring. Rules and board configurations of the game vary from league to league, but are generally played single, head-to-head or with teams.\n\nDart golf games have been known since as early as 1932 based on Harrison Johnston UK Patent submission. Later, NODOR produced an 18-hole golf dartboard and another dartboard called PAR DARTS. Further, there was a patent filed in 1997 by Howard Hanson for a dartboard where the numbers are in a different order than the standard dartboard to make playing golf on the board more like playing a golf course. Finally, Dolf was developed on September 1, 1999 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada by Keith Meyer and Michael Meyer where a golf like game is played on a standard dart board. Dolf is regulated by the World Dolf Federation (WDFF) with representation in Canada and Pakistan.\n\nThe dartboards used to play dart golf games consist of 3 major categories. First are dartboards that are representations of golf courses. Second are dartboards that are very similar to traditional dartboards but are arranged differently in order to make playing golf on the board more representative of playing golf. The final category is playing dart golf games on traditional dartboards.\n\nThe rules of the dart golf games vary. Typically for the dartboards that are representation of golf courses, the player's score is determined by where in the area defining the hole the dart lands. In general, if the player lands closer to the hole they will have a better score. For dart golf games that are played on either traditional dartboards or dartboards that are derivatives of traditional dartboards, the scoring is derived from landing the darts in the number related to the hole the player is on, the double, the treble, the 25 and the bull's eye such as Halex's Golf, A1Darts' Golf, Dolf and Apex Golf.\n\n\n"}

This stadium held the annual Kyung-Pyong Football Match between Kyungsung FC and Pyongyang FC during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.\n\nOn 14 October 1945, it was the site of Kim Il-sung's victory speech after the liberation of Pyongyang, called \"Every Effort for the Building of a New Democratic Korea\".\n\nAfter the division of Korea, it was used as a venue for speeches by politicians, and it was the site of Kim Il-sung's first speech after returning from exile on 14 October 1945. Most of the stadium was destroyed during the 1950-1953 Korean War, mostly by U.S. aerial bombing of the capital city during those years. Rebuilt in 1969, it was then called Moranbong Stadium, but in April 1982 it was renovated and renamed in honour of Kim Il-sung. It is used mainly for football matches, and hosted the mass games until the 1990s (now held in Rungnado May Day Stadium).\n\nToday, the Kim Il-sung stadium is used as the home ground for the North Korea national football team, the North Korea women's national football team and the Pyongyang City Sports Club and Kigwancha Sports Club.\n\nIn 2008, on two occasions, a 2010 World Cup qualifying match between North and South Korea, due to be played in Pyongyang, had to be moved to Shanghai when authorities in the North refused to allow the South Korean national anthem to be played in Kim Il-sung Stadium, or the flag of South Korea to be flown, as North and South Korea have never granted each other formal diplomatic recognition.\n\nThe start and finish of the annual Pyongyang Marathon occurs at Kim Il-sung Stadium.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4094208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4094208", "title": "New Meadow", "text": "New Meadow\n\nNew Meadow, also known as Montgomery Waters Meadow for sponsorship purposes, is the home ground of English football club Shrewsbury Town.\n\nThe stadium is situated on the southern outskirts of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, between the districts of Meole Brace and Sutton Farm, and close to the A5. It was completed in the summer of 2007, in time for the 2007–08 English football season, and was built to replace the Gay Meadow stadium, home of Shrewsbury Town since 1910. It is also a UEFA Category 4 stadium.\n\nThe stadium had no official name during the club's first season at their new home, before being christened the \"Prostar Stadium\" in a four-year deal with the sports kit manufacturer of the same name in July 2008. The club had initially distanced themselves from the unofficial name of \"New Meadow\", preferring to sever links with the old Gay Meadow ground, however when the naming deal with Prostar ended two years earlier than scheduled, new sponsors Greenhous gave supporters the opportunity to vote for a new stadium name, with \"Meadow\" added to the shortlist after feedback from fans. From May 2010, the stadium was officially known as \"Greenhous Meadow\", until Greenhous announced they would be ending their sponsorship of the club and stadium in November 2016, with local firm Montgomery Waters taking on the naming rights from July 2017.\n\nProposals to move to a new stadium site at Oteley Road were first drawn up in the late 1990s, with planning permission granted in September 2003. A covenant protecting the Gay Meadow site for sports use was transferred to Oteley Road in 2004, clearing the way for the sale of the old ground to property developers to finance the building of New Meadow.\n\nThe stadium was designed by WDW Partnership architects, with the project awarded to Hall Construction, at a cost of £11.2 million, with a brief to build a 10,000 capacity all-seater stadium, with banqueting facilities for up to 300 people. The project consisted of erecting four stands, including hospitality boxes, function rooms, kitchen, bars, offices and a club shop as well as adjoining community and training pitches, a 670 space car park and access roads. Work was completed for the new stadium to open in time for the beginning of the 2007–08 Football League Two season.\n\nThe East and West stands run the length of the pitch; the South and North stands face onto the ends of the pitch. All stands are fully seated and covered; each stand also has its own catering (licensed) and toilets. At present the stands are detached from one another.\n\n\nAfter the first nine seasons hosted at New Meadow, the average attendance for first-team league matches stood at 5,612, approximately 57% of capacity (see table below), with no confirmed prospect of stadium expansion in the foreseeable future as of July 2016.\n\nIn September 2014, Shrewsbury drew Chelsea at home in the fourth round of the League Cup. With the club anticipating a high demand for tickets, C.E.O. Matt Williams proposed that temporary seating could be erected in the corners between the existing stands. In order to maintain segregation between home and away supporters, and to allow access for emergency vehicles, the proposals were later reduced to two temporary stands at the South (home) end of the ground, With match tickets selling out on their first day of general sale, the club confirmed the plans on 13 October 2014, which temporarily raised the capacity of New Meadow to 10,361.\n\nSubsequent developments on the stadium site include 5G 5-a-side and 7-a-side pitches currently operated by Powerleague, and a community centre run by \"Shrewsbury Town in the Community\" which opened on land behind the South stand in 2016. A memorial garden area to remember fans, staff and players who have died was also relocated near the entrance to the stadium in the same year. Shropshire Football Association are also based at New Meadow, with their county office located in a building at the rear of the South stand.\n\nThe food retailer Lidl submitted plans to build a supermarket at the stadium site in May 2016, however this was partly reliant on the local council agreeing to move land earmarked for community use at the North end of the ground to another part of the site. Planning permission for the Lidl development and a new community pitch was approved in April 2017, with building work due to begin the following month.\n\nIn June 2017, Shrewsbury Town applied to the Sports Grounds Safety Authority to convert an existing section of the all-seater New Meadow stadium to a safe standing area, making them the first club in the English Football League to do so. Permission was granted the following month, with £75,000 to be raised via a crowdfunding initiative to install rail seating to the back of the South Stand, with a planned capacity of 550.\n\nWith the ground not being centrally located and with only limited car parking on-site, the club operates a matchday travel plan, to encourage spectators to walk, cycle or use organised transport where possible. Shrewsbury railway station is approximately two miles from the stadium.\n\nThe first match at the new ground was an All Stars' friendly game as part of Shrewsbury Town's new sponsorship deal with Italian sportswear manufacturer A-Line, who made Shrewsbury's kit for the 2007-08 season. Heading the list of All-Stars players was Gianfranco Zola, with the team being managed by Ron Atkinson. The match took place on Saturday 14 July 2007, and Shrewsbury Town ran out 4−0 winners, Shrewsbury striker Dave Hibbert taking the honour of being the first ever goalscorer at the new ground.\n\nThe first competitive match at New Meadow was a League Cup match against Colchester United, of the Championship, then two divisions above Shrewsbury. It took place on Tuesday 14 August 2007, Shrewsbury winning 1−0 thanks to a header from Darran Kempson in extra time. The first league fixture, in League Two, was against Bradford City on Saturday 18 August, with Shrewsbury winning 1−0 from a first half penalty scored by Dave Hibbert.\n\nIn November 2007 the England women's national football team played Spain at New Meadow. England won 1–0 with a Karen Carney goal.\n\nOn 18 October 2010 it was announced that New Meadow has been selected as part of England's bid to host the UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship in 2013. On 28 January 2011, however, it was ruled Israel will host the Under 21s Finals.\n\nOn 27 March 2012, the generator room in the East Stand caught fire which caused the League Two match against Port Vale to be abandoned in the second half with the score 1–0 to Shrewsbury Town. Shrewsbury then won the replayed match 1–0.\n\nShrewsbury Town went 34 matches unbeaten in all competitions at New Meadow over an 18-month period between 2011 and 2012, under manager Graham Turner. The run was ended by a 1−0 defeat to Scunthorpe United in September 2012.\n\n\"First team competitive matches featuring Shrewsbury Town only. As of 10 January 2018.\"\n\n"}

It is the largest stadium in India by seating capacity. Before its renovation in 2011, it was the second largest football stadium in the world, having a seating capacity of 120,000. Prior to the construction and opening of Rungrado May Day Stadium in 1989, it was the largest football stadium in the world. The stadium hosted the final match of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, alongside hosting other matches of the tournament. As part of security measures for the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, the stadium was only open for 66,687 viewers instead of the stadium’s capacity of 85,000.\n\nThe stadium's record attendance was recorded in 1997 when 131,781 spectators watched the between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan.\n\nThe stadium recently switched back to natural grass from artificial turf as part of the preparations for hosting the U-17 World Cup in 2017. The new turf was unveiled in a Kolkata Derby match between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan during the 2015–16 Calcutta Premier Division match.\n\nThe stadium was established in 1984 because the club grounds in the Maidan area, each with capacity around 20,000, were proving too small for the huge crowd that occupied the grounds on matchdays. And while the Eden Gardens was there to handle some of the bigger games, like the Kolkata Derby, the pressure of handling both cricket and football was proving to be a bit too much for the stadium.\n\nThe stadium is situated approximately 10 kilometres to the east of the Kolkata downtown. The roof is made of metal tubes and aluminum sheets and concrete. The stadium was inaugurated in January 1984. There are two electronic scoreboards and control rooms. There is illumination at night . There are special arrangements for TV broadcasting.\n\nThe gigantic stadium features three tiers of concrete galleries. The stadium has 9 entry gates and 30 ramps for the spectators to reach the viewing blocks. The nine gates include the VIP gate. The gates 1 and 2 are on kadapara road, gate no.3, 3A, 4, 4A and 4B are on the side of Broadway; gate no 5 and the VIP gate are on the side of EM By pass. The ramps are inside the stadium and link the inner ring road to the different levels of the stadium complex.\n\nThe stadium covers an area of . The stadium has a unique synthetic track for athletic meets. It has a main football arena measuring . It also houses electronics scoreboards, elevators, VIP enclosures, peripheral floodlighting arrangement from the roof-top, air-conditioned VIP rest room, conference hall and much more. The stadium has its own water arrangements and standby diesel generation sets.\n\nThe renovation project started in February 2015. The artificial turf at the stadium has been replaced by an all-natural grass pitch. The new grass is from Reivera Bermuda seeds procured from the USA and below it there are two layers of sand and gravel. The next layer is fitted with perforated pipes so that water-logging won’t be an issue.\n\nGerman company Porplastic provided the elastic coating for the running track around the pitch which was replaced for the first time since the stadium was built in 1984. The old track has been scooped out and the new surface was laid.\n\nThe lobby of the VIP entrance that leads to the player's arena, was air-conditioned. The broadcast rooms and stadium offices were renovated.\n\nBucket seats replaced the concrete benches in the galleries, which brought down the stadium's capacity from 120,000 to 85,000.\n\nThe VIP and press boxes, both in the middle tier, were pulled down and a new press box with a capacity of 240 seats is now on the third tier. The VIP box remained on the second tier, with an added 240 seats. The press conference room that used to be cramped during derbies and matches featuring international teams has been shifted to a 19 x 8.5-metre space under a gallery. A spacious broadcast room of similar dimensions has been \nbuilt as well. \n\nTwo full-sized practice grounds with perforations on the surface for underground drainage and eight floodlight towers have come up at the Hyatt end of the stadium, as recommended by FIFA. The same imported Reveria Bermuda grass used on the main turf will cover the practice grounds. The drainage network has been designed to ensure that the surface never becomes slushy. The referees rooms have been built alongside the practice grounds. \n\nThe number of gates to the stadium has been increased from seven to nine. Some of the existing gates has been widened too, as are the approaches that connect the entrances and exits to the ring road. Each link road is 21 meters wide. The surroundings has been beautified by the forest department.\n\nTo the left of the lobby, rooms have been constructed for referees and ball boys.\n\nThe stadium is located in the satellite township of Salt Lake and it also lies on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass which makes it easily accessible by road. \n\nThere are numerous buses which ply around the city to the stadium. The Line 2 of the metro will be passing near the stadium, therefore the stadium will have its own station which is expected to open by Oct 2018. The stadium is approx away from N.S.C.Bose International Airport.\n\nAfter its inauguration in January, 1984 with the Jawaharlal Nehru International Gold Cup, the Salt Lake Stadium has hosted several important international tournaments and matches such as matches of the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification in 1985, Super-Soccers in 1986, 1989, 1991 and 1994, 3rd South Asian Games in 1987, USSR Festival Cup in 1988, Charminar Challenger Trophy in 1992 and the Jawaharlal Nehru International Gold Cup in 1995.\n\nThe Salt Lake Stadium hosts the home games of the local clubs Mohun Bagan and East Bengal who play in the I-League. It also hosts the games of Mohammedan, who currently play in the 2nd Division I-League. Many of the home games of the Indian Team are also played in the Salt Lake Stadium. Since 2014 a new tenant team Atlético de Kolkata (playing in the ISL) has made the stadium their home ground.\n\nOn June 5, 2011 FIFA scheduled a friendly match to be played at the Salt Lake on 2 September 2011. The match was played between Argentina and Venezuela. This was a historic occasion in the history of Indian football and also for the stadium as the match featured Argentine superstar Lionel Messi.\nThe stadium has also hosted Oliver Kahn's official farewell match for Bayern Munich when they played a friendly match against Mohun Bagan. Bayern Munich won the match 3–0.\nIn December 2012, a friendly match was played between Brazil Masters and IFA All Stars. Brazil Masters won it 3–1. Beto scored twice and Bebeto scored one goal for Brazil Masters.\n\nOn 12 October 2014, the stadium hosted the first match in the Indian Super League, preceded by an opening ceremony which featured superstars from the footballing world as well as from Bollywood. In the opening match, Atlético de Kolkata defeated Mumbai City FC 3–0. The stadium hosted its last match of the inaugural edition of ISL on 14 December where Atlético de Kolkata played FC Goa in the first leg of the semi-finals. Salt Lake stadium was the only stadium among the eight venues of ISL where matches were allowed to be played on artificial turf. It hosted 11 matches in 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, including the Final.\n\nThe stadium also hosts important athletic events. It has hosted the SAF Games in 1987 and various national athletics events in India. The stadium also hosts different kinds of cultural programs such as dance and music concerts. The stadium also hosted the opening ceremony of 2013 IPL Season, and it featured live performances of American rapper Pitbull and Indian film stars Shahrukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Deepika Padukone.\n\n\n"}

It was used mainly for football matches as it was home to the Lille OSC football club from 1975 until 2004, when the stadium was closed.\n\nThe club originally planned to have Grimonprez-Jooris redeveloped into a 33,000-seat stadium, but this proposal was rejected, and the Grand Stade Lille Métropole was constructed instead.\n\nThe stadium was officially opened on 28 October 1975, when Lille played a friendly against Dutch side Feyenoord (which ended in a 1–1 draw) and the last match at the stadium was played on 15 May 2004, Lille's last home game in the 2003–04 Ligue 1 season against SC Bastia. Lille won the game 2–0 with Matt Moussilou scoring the last goal in the history of Grimonprez-Jooris.\n\nThe club's original stadium Stade Henri-Jooris had been demolished in 1975 in order to allow the enlargement of the Canal de la Deûle, a navigable waterway which passes through the city of Lille, and the design for a new stadium was made by Lille architect Pierre-François Delannoyla. Although the club wanted the new stadium to retain the old name \"Stade Henri Jooris\" (named after Henri Jooris, former Lille OSC manager), the mayor proposed it to be called \"Stade Félix Grimonprez\" after Félix Grimonprez, a former field hockey player who competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1936 Summer Olympics. This resulted in a compromise solution in which the stadium was hence named \"Stade Grimonprez-Jooris\".\n\nThe stadium's original capacity was 25,000 at the time it was opened, but this was reduced to around 17,000 by 2000 due to the evolution of safety standards. In 2000 the stadium was renovated and the capacity was increased to 21,128 (14,534 seated). However, the stadium still failed to meet FIFA licensing regulations and Lille had to play their 2001–02 UEFA Champions League matches at the Stade Félix-Bollaert.\n\nPlans to build a new stadium compliant with UEFA's standards were made in 2002, when the club was privatised. City authorities tried to persuade the club's new owners to redevelop the existing stadium, but they refused and instead opted for a plan to build a new 60,000-seat stadium outside the city, financed as a public-private partnership. However, their search for investors willing to finance the ambitious project was met with little success.\n\nIn June 2003 the club's board agreed to a new proposal put forward by the city mayor to build a new 33,000-seat stadium on the site of the Grimonprez-Jooris. Preliminary works which included dismantling of training grounds were undertaken, and the delivery was scheduled for 31 December 2004 but was postponed. In the meantime the funding of the project moved from the City Council to the Urban Community of Lille Métropole and became 100 percent public. Construction work was then planned to begin in early 2005, but the project faced opposition from preservationists who successfully prevented the project to obtain necessary permits as the site of the stadium was close to the 17th-century Citadel of Lille. The delays forced Lille OSC to play their league matches at Stadium Nord Lille Métropole and their 2005–06 UEFA Champions League games at Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis.\n\nAfter two years of court battles, local courts had declared issued building permits void in July and December 2005, which meant that Grimonprez-Jooris II would never come into existence. Once the dismantling of training grounds was completed, the club moved their facilities to Camphin-en-Pévèle. The failed project cost the city of Lille 6 million euros, including 3 million paid to the architecture bureau, 2 million in damages to businesses which invested in the project and 1 million for court fees. The future of the stadium was unclear until January 2007 when the Urban Community of Lille Métropole decided to fund the demolition of the stadium. The demolition works finally began in March 2010.\n\n"}

It has a seating capacity of 25,000.\n\nSituated in the Gerland quarter, it was used by French professional football club Olympique Lyonnais, who moved to the newly constructed Parc Olympique Lyonnais in 2016. Local rugby union club Lyon OU moved in beginning of 2017, replacing their much smaller stadium Matmut Stadium. The stadium's capacity was also reduced from 43,000 to a more reasonable 25,000.\n\nThe Stade de Gerland is listed as a Category three stadium by UEFA's standards and has hosted matches for the 1972 Rugby League World Cup, UEFA Euro 1984, the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\n\nThe stadium has hosted concerts by many famous artists, including The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Pink Floyd and Genesis. Former president Nicholas Sarkozy played at this arena with his rock band when he was a teenager, before getting involved in politics.\n\nIn 1910, the mayor of Lyon, Édouard Herriot, came up with the idea to develop and build a sports stadium with an athletics track and a velodrome in the city. In 1912, the stadium was officially mandated and local architect Tony Garnier was given the reins to designing and constructing it. Construction began in 1914 with hopes that the stadium would be completed before the International Exhibition of 1914. However, due to World War I, construction was temporarily halted, but resumed following the wars conclusion in 1919 with the assistance of a large number of German POWs. By 1920, the stadium was completely functional. In 1926, the Stade de Gerland was inaugurated by Herriot.\n\nThe stadium originally had a cycling track, but it was removed in order to increase the seating capacity to 50,000. In 1984, minor renovations were made to the stadium by architect Rene Gagis in order to bring the stadium up to standards for UEFA Euro 1984. This included construction of the Jean Bouin and Jean Jaurès stands. Further renovations were needed to prepare the stadium for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, as by that time FIFA had mandated that all stadiums used for international matches, including the World Cup, had to be all-seated. The north and south stands were completely dismantled and rebuilt, the Jean Jaurès and Jean Bouin side stands were untouched and the athletics track that had remained, even after the cycling track had been removed, was taken out. The renovations were done by architect Albert Constantin. The new incarnation of Gerland had a maximum capacity of 40,500.\n\nSince 1950 the stadium has been home to French professional football club Olympique Lyonnais who play in Ligue 1, France's highest football division. Lyon moved into the stadium as a result of splitting from the Lyon Olympique Universitaire sport club, which played at the Stade des Iris. The record attendance for a Ligue 1 match is 48,552 for a derby match between Olympique Lyonnais and AS Saint-Étienne in 1982.\n\nDuring the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup semi-final at the stadium between Cameroon and Colombia, Cameroon midfielder Marc-Vivien Foé collapsed on the pitch and died shortly afterwards in hospital.\n\nGerland is also used for events of mass such as The Rolling Stones's concerts, Michael Jackson, Pink Floyd, Johnny Hallyday, Genesis.\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the UEFA Euro 1984, and held the following matches:\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and held the following matches:\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, and held the following matches:\n\nThe stadium hosted three pool matches in the 2007 Rugby World Cup: Australia vs Japan, Argentina vs Georgia and New Zealand vs Portugal.\n\nStade de Gerland played host to the 1972 Rugby League World Cup Final between Great Britain and Australia. The French public seemed uninterested in a final that did not involve the French team, as only 4,231 spectators turned up. The game will always be remembered by the British for their captain Clive Sullivan's wonderful long distance try, and by the Australians for perhaps \"The greatest try never scored\", later shown on TV to be legitimately scored by Australian fullback Graeme Langlands, but disallowed by French referee Georges Jameau who believed him to be offside (TV footage indicated Langlands had been approximately one metre behind halfback Dennis Ward as he put up his kick). Lions hooker Mike Stephenson scored the 73rd-minute try that helped Great Britain level the scores and secure the World Cup. Had Aussie winger Ray Branighan succeeded with a 79th-minute penalty, or Bob Fulton landed one of three drop goal attempts in the last five minutes, the cup could easily have gone to Australia. But for the first time in the competition's history the scores were level at full time. An additional twenty minutes extra time was played, but no further score resulted, and Great Britain were awarded the cup by virtue of a better W-L record and due to having defeated Australia earlier in the tournament.\n\n\n"}

It is owned by Llanelli Town Council. From 2015 Raiders RL club used the stadium for their debut season in the Conference League South but are now based at the park on a permanent basis as they compete in the RFL professional tier as the only professional Rugby League team in South Wales.\n\nStebonheath Park has been used as a football ground since 1920. It almost hosted League football in the 1930s but the club lost out coming second in the vote. At the time the ground had a large wooden grandstand, a covered end terrace and a large bank on the south side, and it could easily have been developed into a Third Division ground.

Frank Whitcombe made his debut for Wales in this game.\n\nThe stadium has been owned by Llanelli Town Council since 1977. The council undertook major redevelopmemts of the stadium which included floodlighting, a new 700 seater main stand, new terracing, a function room social club as well as all-weather training facilities for the athletics club. In July 2008, a new open seated stand was built on existing terracing along one side of the ground with about 300 seats.\n\nAround the pitch is a narrow 400 metre running track with four lanes on each straight. It is the narrowest 400m track in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn 28 February 2006 the stadium hosted an international match between Wales Under-21s and Northern Ireland Under-21s, with the Northern Irish side winning 1-0.\n\nLocal junior football finals are held at the stadium. The Welsh Cup Final has been staged at the stadium including the 2002-03 season final between Barry Town and Cwmbran Town as well as the 2004-05 final between Total Network Solutions and Carmarthen Town.

Stradey Park was demolished in late 2008 and an option for major games was the then newly built 14,340 capacity Parc y Scarlets.\n\nThe new open seated stand at Stebonheath Park enabled Llanelli to host European matches, the first being a UEFA Champions League qualifier against Latvian club FK Ventspils in July 2008.\n\nLanelli AAC, which was formed in 1978, is based at the stadium and caters for all standards of track and field athletics, cross-country running and road running.\n\nWest Wales Raiders RL relocated to Llanelli in 2014 and struck up a deal to play at the stadium with the local council in preparation for the debut season in the Conference league south where they finished 3rd. The West Wales Raiders Rugby League Club previously known as Raiders RL are the most established Rugby league club[1] in West Wales formed in January 2015.[2] Formerly called Gwendreath Valley Raiders they moved to Llanelli when the club gained entry into the Conference League South which is level 4 of the Rugby League system. In 2017, Andrew Thorne purchased the semi professional League 1 club South Wales Ironmen, relocating the club immediately to Llanelli. The Ironmen will rebrand as West Wales Raiders from 2018 onwards.\n\nThey also have links with one of the oldest university rugby league teams in Wales the Warpigs from Swansea University. The raiders have taken over the running and coaching of the university rugby league team since 2017.\n\nThe Raiders first ever match was an away friendly against Aberystwyth University in February which they won 72-6. Their first league match was a home derby win against the defending champions Valley Cougars 34-6, captain Alan Pope scoring the clubs first try. The game was watched by over 370 spectators.[citation needed]\n\nThe record attendance at Stebonheath Park is 1,410 for a Welsh Premier League football match between Llanelli and Barry Town on 14 January 2000.\n"}
